      <field name="fulltext">Narrative Poems. THE STORY OF RIMINI; OR, FRUITS OF A PARENT'S FALSEHOOD. 1814—RECAST. CANTO I. Argument. —Giovanni Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, has won by his victories the hand of the Princess Francesca, daughter of the reigning Count of Ravenna; and is expected, with a gorgeous procession, to come and marry her. She has never yet seen him. The procession arrives, and is described. 'Tis morn, and never did a lovelier day Salute Ravenna from its leafy bay; For a warm eve, and gentle rains at night, Have left a sparkling welcome for the light, And April, with his white hands wet with flowers, Dazzles the bride-maids, looking from the towers: Green vineyards and fair orchards, far and near, Glitter with drops; and heaven is sapphire clear, And the lark rings it, and the pine-trees glow, And odours from the citrons come and go, And all the landscape—earth, and sky, and sea— Breathes like a bright-eyed face, that laughs out openly. 'Tis nature, full of spirits, wak'd and lov'd. E'en sloth, to-day, goes quick and unreprov'd; For where's the living soul, priest, minstrel, clown, Merchant, or lord, that speeds not to the town? Hence happy faces, striking through the green Of leafy roads, at every turn are seen; And the far ships, lifting their sails of white Like joyful hands, come up with scatter'd light; Come gleaming up—true to the wish'd-for day— And chase the whistling brine, and swirl into the bay. And well may all the world come crowding there, If peace returning, and processions rare, And, to crown all, a marriage in the spring Can set men's hearts and fancies on the wing; For, on this beauteous day, Ravenna's pride— The daughter of their prince—becomes a bride; A bride to ransom an exhausted land; And he, whose victories have obtain'd her hand, Has taken with the dawn—so flies report— His promis'd journey to the expecting court, With hasting pomp, and squires of high degree, The bold Giovanni, Lord of Rimini. The road, that way, is lined with anxious eyes, And false announcements and fresh laughters rise. The horseman hastens through the jeering crowd, And finds no horse within the gates allow'd; And who shall tell the drive there, and the din? The bells, the drums, the crowds yet squeezing in, The shouts, from mere exuberance of delight, The mothers with their babes in sore affright, The bands of troops making important way, Gallant and grave, the lords of holiday; Minstrels, and friars, and beggars many a one That pray, and roll their blind eyes in the sun, And all the buzzing throngs, that hang like bees On roofs, and walls, and tops of garden trees? With tap'stries bright the windows overflow, By lovely faces brought, that come and go, Till by their work the charmers take their seats, Themselves the sweetest pictures in the streets, In colours by light awnings beautified; Some re-adjusting tresses newly tied, Some turning a trim waist, or o'er the flow Of crimson cloths hanging a hand of snow: Smiling and laughing some, and some serene, But all with flowers, and all with garlands green, And most in flattering talk impatient for the scene. At length the approaching trumpets, with a start On the smooth wind, come dancing to the heart; The crowd are mute; and, from the southern wall, A lordly blast gives welcome to the call. Then comes the crush; and all who best can strive In shuffling struggle, tow'rds the palace drive, Where baluster'd and broad, of marble fair, Its portico commands the public square: For there Count Guido is to hold his state, With his fair daughter, seated o'er the gate. But far too well the square has been supplied; And, after a rude heave from side to side, With angry faces turn'd and nothing gain'd, The order, first found easiest, is maintain'd, Leaving the pathways only for the crowd, The space within for the procession proud. For in this manner is the square set out:— The sides, path-deep, are crowded round about, And fac'd with guards, who keep the horse-way clear; And, round a fountain in the midst, appear— Seated with knights and ladies, in discourse— Rare Tuscan wits and warbling troubadours, Whom Guido (for he lov'd the Muses' race) Has set there to adorn his public place. The seats with boughs are shaded from above Of bays and roses,—trees of wit and love; And in the midst, fresh whistling through the scene, The lightsome fountain starts from out the green, Clear and compact; till, at its height o'errun, It shakes its loosening silver in the sun. There, with the wits and beauties, you may see, As in some nest of faëry poetry, Some of the chiefs, the noblest in the land,— Hugo, and Borso of the Liberal Hand, And Gino, and Ridolfo, and the flower Of jousters, Everard of the Sylvan Tower; And Felix the Fine Arm, and him who well Repaid the Black-Band robbers, Lionel; With more that have pluck'd beards of Turk and Greek, And made the close Venetian lower his sails and speak. There, too, in thickest of the bright-eyed throng, Stands a young father of Italian song— Guy Cavalcanti, of a knightly race; The poet looks out in his earnest face: He with the pheasant's plume—there—bending now: Something he speaks around him with a bow, And all the listening looks, with nods and flushes, Break round him into smiles and grateful blushes. Another start of trumpets, with reply; And o'er the gate a crimson canopy Opens to right and left its flowing shade, And Guido issues with the princely maid, And sits;—the courtiers fall on either side; But every look is fixed upon the bride, Who seems all thought at first, and hardly hears The enormous shout that springs as she appears; Till, as she views the countless gaze below, And faces that with grateful homage glow, A home to leave and husband yet to see Are mix'd with thoughts of lofty charity: And hard it is, she thinks, to have no will; But not to bless these thousands, harder still. With that a keen and quivering sense of tears Scarce moves her sweet, proud lip, and disappears; A smile is underneath, and breaks away, And round she looks and breathes, as best befits the day. What need I tell of cheeks, and lips, and eyes, The locks that fall, and bosom's balmy rise? Beauty's whole soul is hers, though shadow'd still With anxious thought, and doubtful maiden will; A lip for endless love, should all prove just; An eye that can withdraw into as deep distrust. While thus with earnest looks the people gaze, Another shout the neighb'ring quarters raise: The train are in the town, and gathering near With noise of cavalry and trumpets clear, A princely music unbedinn'd with drums; The mighty brass seems opening as it comes; And now it fills, and now it shakes the air, And now it bursts into the sounding square; At which the crowd with such a shout rejoice, Each thinks he's deafen'd with his neighbour's voice. Then with a long-drawn breath the clangours die, The palace trumpets give a last reply, And clustering hoofs succeed, with stately stir Of snortings proud and clinking furniture,— The most majestic sound of human will: Nought else is heard sometime, the people are so still. First come the trumpeters, clad all in white, Except the breast, which wears a scutcheon bright. By four and four they ride, on horses gray; And as they sit along their easy way, To the steed's motion yielding as they go, Each plants his trumpet on his saddle-bow. The heralds next appear, in vests attir'd, Of stiffening gold with radiant colours fir'd; And then the pursuivants who wait on these, All dress'd in painted richness to the knees; Each rides a dappled horse, and bears a shield, Charg'd with three heads upon a golden field. Twelve ranks of squires come after, twelve in one, With forked pennons lifted in the sun, Which tell, as they look backward in the wind, The bearings of the knights that ride behind. Their horses are deep bay; and every squire His master's colour shows in his attire. These past, and at a lordly distance, come The knights themselves, and fill the quickening hum— The flower of Rimini. Apart they ride, Two in a rank, their falchions by their side, But otherwise unarm'd, and clad in hues Such as their ladies had been pleas'd to chuse, Bridal and gay,—orange, and pink, and white,— All but the scarlet cloak for every knight; Which thrown apart, and hanging loose behind, Rests on the horse, and ruffles in the wind. The horses, black and glossy every one, Supply a further stately unison— A solemn constancy of martial show; Their frothy bits keep wrangling as they go. The bridles red, and saddle-cloths of white, Match well the blackness with its glossy light, While the rich horse-cloths, mantling half the steed, Are some of them all thick with golden thread; Others have spots, on grounds of different hue— As burning stars upon a cloth of blue; Or heart's-ease purple with a velvet light, Rich from the glary yellow, thickening bright; Or silver roses in carnation sewn, Or flowers in heaps, or colours pure alone: But all go sweeping back, and seem to dress The forward march with loitering stateliness. The crowd, with difference of delight, admire Horseman and horse, the motion and the attire. Some watch the riders' looks as they go by, Their self-possess'd though pleas'd observancy; And some their skill admire, and careless heed, Or body curving to the rearing steed, Or patting hand that best persuades the check, And makes the quarrel up with a proud neck. Others are bent upon the horses most,— Their shape, their breed, the glory of their host: The small bright head, free nostrils, fetlocks clean, The branching veins ridging the glossy lean, The start and snatch, as if they felt the comb, With mouths that fling about the creamy foam.— The snorting turbulence, the nod, the champing, The shift, the tossing, and the fiery tramping. And now the Princess, pale and with fix'd eye, Perceives the last of those precursors nigh, Each rank uncovering as they pass in state, Both to the courtly fountain and the gate; And then a second interval succeeds Of stately length, and then a troop of steeds Milk-white and azure-draped, Arabian bred, Each by a blooming boy lightsomely led. In every limb is seen their faultless race, A fire well-temper'd, and a free left grace: Slender their spotless shapes, and greet the sight With freshness after all those colours bright; And as with easy pitch their steps they bear, Their yielding heads have half a loving air, These for a princely present are divin'd, And show the giver is not far behind. The talk increases now, and now advance, Space after space, with many a sprightly prance, The pages of the court, in rows of three; Of white and crimson in their livery. Space after space, and still the train appear; A fervent whisper fills the general ear— “Ah—yes—no! 'tis not he, but 'tis the squires Who go before him when his pomp requires.” And now his huntsman shows the lessening train, Now the squire-carver, and the chamberlain; And now his banner comes, and now his shield, Borne by the squire that waits him to the field; And then an interval,—a lordly space;— A pin-drop silence strikes o'er all the place. The Princess, from a distance, scarcely knows Which way to look; her colour comes and goes, And, with an impulse like a piteous plea, She lays her hand upon her father's knee, Who looks upon her with a laboured smile, Gathering it up into his own the while, When some one's voice, as if it knew not how To check itself, exclaims, “The Prince! now, now!” And on a milk-white courser, like the air, A glorious figure springs into the square:— Up, with a burst of thunder, goes the shout, And rolls the trembling walls and peopled roofs about. Never was nobler finish of fair sight,— 'Twas like the coming of a shape of light; And many a lovely gazer, with a start, Felt the quick pleasure smite across her heart. The Princess, who at first could scarcely see, Though looking still that way from dignity, Gathers new courage as the praise goes round, And bends her eyes to learn what they have found. And see—his horse obeys the check unseen, And, with an air 'twixt ardent and serene, Letting a fall of curls about his brow, He takes, to all, his cap off with a bow. Then for another, and a deafening shout, And scarfs are wav'd, and flowers come pouring out; And, shaken by the noise, the reeling air Sweeps with a giddy whirl among the fair, And whisks their garments and their shining hair. With busy interchange of wonder glows The crowd, and loves his bravery as he goes; But on his shape the gentler sight attends, Moves as he passes, as he bends him bends,— Watches his air, his gesture, and his face, And thinks it never saw such manly grace; So fine are his bare throat, and curls of black,— So lightsomely dropt in, his lordly back, His thigh so fitted for the tilt or dance, So heap'd with strength, and turn'd with elegance; But, above all, so meaning in his look, As easy to be read as open book; And such true gallantry the sex descries In the grave thanks within his cordial eyes. His haughty steed, who seems by turns to be Vex'd and made proud by that cool mastery, Shakes at his bit, and rolls his eyes with care, Reaching with stately step at the fine air; And now and then, sideling his restless pace, Drops with his hinder legs, and shifts his place, And feels through all his frame a fiery thrill; The princely rider on his back sits still, And looks where'er he likes, and sways him at his will. Surprise, relief, a joy scarce understood— Something, in truth, of very gratitude, And fifty feelings undefin'd and new, Dart through the bride, and flush her faded hue. “Could I but once,” she thinks, “securely place A trust for the contents on such a case— On such a mind, now seemingly beheld— This chance of mine were hardly one compell'd.” And see! the stranger looking with delight Tow'rds the sweet fountain with its circle bright, And bending, as he looks, with frequent thanks, Beckons a follower to him from the ranks, And loos'ning, as he speaks, from its light hold, A princely jewel with its chain of gold, Sends it, in token he had lov'd him long, To the young master of Italian song. The poet starts, and with a lowly grace Bending his lifted eyes and blushing face, Looks after his new friend, who scarcely gone In the wide turning, bows, and passes on. This is sufficient for the destined bride: She took an interest first, but now a pride; And as the Prince comes riding to the place, Baring his head, and raising his fine face, She meets his full obeisance with an eye Of self-permission and sweet gravity; He looks with touch'd respect, and gazes and goes by. CANTO II. Argument. —The Prince is discovered not to be Giovanni Malatesta, but his brother Paulo, whom he has sent as his proxy. Francesca, nevertheless, is persuaded to be affianced, and goes with him to Rimini. Description of the journey, and of the Ravenna Pine-Forest. I pass the followers, and their closing state; The court was enter'd by an outer gate; The Count and Princess had retir'd before, In time to greet his guest at the hall door: But something seem'd amiss, and there ensued Deep talk among the spreading multitude, Who stood in groups, or pac'd the measur'd street, Filling with earnest hum the noontide heat. Nor ceas'd the wonder, as the day increas'd, And brought no symptoms of a bridal feast; No mass, no tilt, no largess for the crowd, Nothing to answer that procession proud, But a blank look, as if no court had been— Silence without, and secrecy within; And nothing heard by listening at the walls, But now and then a bustling through the halls, Or the dim organ rous'd at gathering intervals. The truth was this:—The bridegroom had not come, But sent his brother Paulo in his room. The former, said to have a handsome face, Though lame of foot, (“some victory's very grace;”— So Guido call'd it,) yet was stern and proud, Little gallant, and had a chilling cloud Hanging forever on his blunt address, Which he mistook for sov'reign manliness:— But more of this too soon. The father knew The Prince's faults; and he was conscious too, That sweet as was his daughter, and prepar'd To do her duty where appeal was barr'd, She had a sense of marriage, just and free, And where the lover wooed but ruggedly, Might pause, for aught he knew, and fail to strike A chord her own sweet music so unlike. The old man, therefore, not unkind at heart, Yet fond, from habit, of intrigue and art, And little form'd for sentiments like these Which seem'd to him mere maiden niceties, (For lovers of the Muse, alas! could then As well as now, be but half-loving men,) Had thought at once to gratify the pride, Of his stern neighbour, and secure the bride, By telling him, that if, as he had heard, Busy he was just then, 'twas but a word, And he might send and wed her by a third; Only the Count thus farther must presume, For both their sakes, that still a prince must come. The bride meantime was told, and not unmov'd, To look for one no sooner seen than lov'd; And when Giovanni, struck with what he thought Mere proof how his triumphant hand was sought, Despatch'd the wish'd-for prince, who was a man Noble as eye had seen since earth began, The effect was perfect, and the future wife Caught in the elaborate snare—perhaps for life. One truth, however, craft was forc'd to tell, And chance, alas! supported it too well. She saw, when they were hous'd, in Guido's face A look of stupified surprise take place; Of anger next, of candour in a while, And then 'twas told her with a begging smile, That Prince Giovanni, to his deep chagrin, Had been delay'd by troubles unforeseen, But rather than delay his day of bliss, (If his fair ruler took it not amiss,) Had sent his brother Paulo in his stead; “Who,” said old Guido, with a nodding head, “May well be said to represent his brother, For when you see the one, you know the other.” By this time Paulo join'd them where they stood, And seeing her in some uneasy mood, Chang'd the mere cold respects his brother sent To such a strain of cordial compliment, And gave her thanks, in terms, and with a face, So fill'd with attribution of all grace,— That air, in short, which sets you at your ease Without implying your perplexities,— That what with the surprise in every way, The hurry of the time, the appointed day, The very shame which now appear'd increas'd Of begging leave to have her hand releas'd— And above all, those tones, and words, and looks Which seem'd to realize the dreams of books, And help'd her genial fancy to conclude That fruit of such a stock must all be good, She knew no longer how she could oppose. Quick was the plighted troth; and at the close The proxy, turning 'mid the general hush, Kiss'd her sweet lips, betwixt a rosy blush. Two days and nights ensued. At length, a state Of trumpets issued from the palace gate, The banners of their brass with favours tied, And with a blast proclaimed the affianc'd bride. But not a word the people's silence broke, Till something of a gift the herald spoke, And bringing the good coin by handfuls out, Scatter'd the ready harvest round about; Then burst the mob into a jovial cry, And “largess! largess!” claps against the sky, And bold Giovanni's name, the lord of Rimini. The rest, however, still were looking on, Sullen and mute, and scarce the noise was gone, When riding from the gate with banners rear'd, Again the gorgeous visitors appear'd. The Prince was in his place; and in a car, Before him, glistening like a farewell star, Sate the dear lady with her brimming eyes, And off they set, through doubtful looks and cries; For some too shrewdly guess'd, and some were vex'd At the dull time, and some the whole perplex'd, And all great pity thought it to divide Two that seem'd made for bridegroom and for bride. Ev'n she, whose wits this strange abrupt event Had over-borne in pure astonishment, Could scarce at times a wilder'd cry forbear At leaving her own home and native air; Till passing now the limits of the town, And on the last few gazers looking down, She saw by the road-side an aged throng, Who wanting power to bustle with the strong, Had learnt their gracious mistress was to go, And gather'd there, an unconcerted show. Bending they stood, with their old foreheads bare, And the winds finger'd with their reverend hair. “Farewell, farewell, my friends!” she would have cried, But in her throat the leaping accents died, And waving with her hand a vain adieu, She dropt her veil, and in her grief withdrew, And let the kindly tears their own good course pursue. The morn was sweet, as when they journey'd last;— The smoke from cottage-tops ran bright and fast, And every tree in passing, one by one, Gleam'd out with twinkles of the golden sun: For leafy was the road, with tall array, On either side, of mulberry and bay, And distant snatches of blue hills between; And there the alder was with its bright green, And the broad chestnut, and the poplar's shoot, That like a feather waves from head to foot, With ever and anon majestic pines; And still, from tree to tree, the early vines Hung garlanding the way in amber lines. Nor long the Princess kept her from the view Of the dear scenes her happy childhood knew; For sitting now, calm from the gush of tears, With dreaming eye fix'd down, and half-shut ears, Hearing, yet hearing not, the fervent sound Of hoofs thick reckoning and the wheel's moist round, A call of “slower,” from the farther part Of the check'd riders, woke her with a start, And looking up again, half sigh, half stare, She lifts her veil, and feels the freshening air. 'Tis down a hill they go, gentle indeed, And such as with a bold and playful speed Another time they would have scorn'd to heed; But now they take a lady down the hill, And feel they should consult her gentle will. And now with thicker shades the pines appear,— The noise of hoofs grows duller on the ear; And quitting suddenly their gravelly toil, The wheels go spinning o'er a sandy soil. Here first the silence of the country seems To come about her with its listening dreams; And full of anxious thoughts, half-freed from pain, She fell into her musing mood again; Leaving the others, who had pass'd that way In careless spirits of the first blithe day, To look about, and mark the reverend scene, For awful tales renown'd and everlasting green. A heavy spot the forest looks at first, To one grim shade condemn'd, and sandy thirst, Chequer'd with thorns, and thistles run to seed, Or plashy pools half-cover'd with green weed, About whose sides the swarming insects fry In the hot sun, a noisome company; But, entering more and more, they quit the sand At once, and strike upon a grassy land, From which the trees as from a carpet rise In knolls and clumps, in rich varieties. The knights are for a moment forc'd to rein Their horses in, which, feeling turf again, Thrill, and curvet, and long to be at large To scour the space, and give the winds a charge, Or pulling tight the bridles as they pass, Dip their warm mouths into the freshening grass: But soon in easy rank, from glade to glade, Proceed they, coasting underneath the shade; Some baring to the cool their placid brows, Some looking upward through the glimmering boughs Or peering into spots that inwardly Open green glooms, and half-prepared to see The lady cross it, that as stories tell, Ran loud and torn before the knight of hell. Various the trees and passing foliage here,— Wild pear, and oak, and dusky juniper, With briony between in trails of white, And ivy, and the suckle's streaky light, And, moss, warm gleaming with a sudden mark, Like growths of sunshine left upon the bark; And still the pine, flat-topp'd, and dark, and tall, In lordly right predominant o'er all. Anon the sweet birds, like a sudden throng Of happy children, ring their tangled song From out the greener trees; and then a cloud Of cawing rooks breaks o'er them, gathering loud Like savages at ships; and then again Nothing is heard but their own stately train, Or ring-dove that repeats his pensive plea, Or startled gull up-screaming toward the sea. But scarce their eyes encounter living thing Save, now and then, a goat loose wandering, Or a few cattle looking up askance With ruminant meek mouths and sleepy glance, Or once, a plodding woodman, old and bent, Passing, half wond'ring—half indifferent— Yet turning at the last to look once more; Then feels his trembling staff, and onward as before. So ride they pleas'd;—till now the couching sun Levels his final look through shadows dun; And the clear moon, with meek o'er-lifted face, Seems come to look into the silvering place. Then woke the bride indeed, for then was heard The sacred bell by which all hearts are stirr'd,— The tongue 'twixt heav'n and earth, the memory mild, Which bids adore the Mother and her Child. The train are hush'd; they halt; their heads are bare; Earth for a moment breathes angelic air. Francesca weeps for lowliness and love; Her heart is at the feet of Her who sits above. Softly they move again through beam and shade; Till now by stragglers met, and watch-dogs bay'd, They quit the piny labyrinths, and soon Emerge into the full and day-like moon: Chilling it seems; and pushing steed on steed, They start them freshly with a homeward speed. Then well-known fields they pass, and straggling cots, Boy-storied trees, and love-remember'd spots, And turning last a sudden corner, see The moonlit towers of wakeful Rimini. The marble bridge comes heaving forth below With a long gleam; and nearer as they go, They see the still Marecchia, cold and bright, Sleeping along with face against the light. A hollow trample now,—a fall of chains,— The bride has enter'd,—not a voice remains;— Night, and a maiden silence, wrap the plains. CANTO III. Argument. —Effects of the sight and manners of her husband upon the bride. His character. Paulo discovers the part he had been led to play. Result of the discovery to him and Francesca. Giovanni is called away from Rimini by a revolt. Description of a garden, and of a summerhouse. Weak were the moon to welcome princely trains:— Thousands of lights, thousands of faces, strains Of music upon music, roaring showers, High as the roofs, of blessings mix'd with flowers; Through these, with one huge hopeful wild accord, The gentle lady of a fiery lord Is welcom'd, and is borne straight to the halls That hold his presence in the palace walls; And there, as pale as death, the future wife Looks on his face that is to sway her life. It stoop'd; she knelt; a kiss was on her brow; And two huge hands rais'd her she scarce knew how. Oh, foolish, false old man! now boast thine art, That has undone thee in a daughter's heart. Great was the likeness that the brothers bore; The lie spoke truth in that, and lied the more. Not that the face on which the lady stared Was hideous; nay, 'twas handsome; yet it scared. The likeness was of race, the difference dire— The brows were shadow'd with a stormy fire; The handsome features had a wild excess, That discommended e'en the handsomeness; And though a smile the lip now gentlier warm'd, The whole big face o'erhung a trunk deform'd,— Warp'd in the shoulder, broken at the hip, Though strong withal, nor spoilt for soldiership; A heap of vigour planted on two stands Of shapeless bone, and hung with giant hands. Compare with this the shape that fetch'd the bride! Compare the face now gazing by its side! A face, in which was nothing e'en to call A stamp exclusive and professional: No courtier's face, and yet the smile was there; No scholar's, yet the look was deep and rare; No soldier's, for the power was all of mind, Too true for violence, and too refin'd: A countenance, in short, seem'd made to show How far the genuine flesh and blood would go; A morning glass of unaffected nature, Something that baffled looks of loftier feature,— The visage of a glorious human creature. Nevertheless, the cripple foremost there, Stern gainer by a crafty father's care, But ignorant of the plot, and aught beside, Except that he had won a peerless bride,— This vision, dress'd beyond its own dress'd court To cloak defects that still belied its port, Gave the bewilder'd beauty what was meant For thanks so gracious, flattery so content, And spoke in tones so harsh, yet so assur'd, So proud of a good fortune now secur'd, That her low answers, for mere shame, implied Thanks for his thanks, and pleasure in his pride; And so the organ blew, and the priest read, And under his grim gaze the life-long words were said. A banquet follow'd, not in form and state, But small, and cheerful, and considerate; Her maidens half-enclos'd her; and her lord With such mild grace presided at the board, And time went flowing in a tide so fair, That from the calm she felt a new despair.— Suddenly her eyes clos'd, her lips turn'd white, The maidens in alarm enclos'd her quite, And the Prince rose, but with no gentle looks; He bade them give her air, with sharp rebukes, Grasp'd her himself with a suspicious force, And altogether show'd a mood so coarse, So hasty, and to love so ill attun'd, That, with her own good will, the lady swoon'd. Alas for wrongs that nature does the frame! The pride she gives compensates not the shame. And yet why moot those puzzles? 'tis the pride, And not the shape, were still the thing to hide. Spirits there are (I've known them) that like gods Who dwelt of old in rustical abodes, Have beam'd through clay the homeliest, bright and wise, And made divinest windows of the eyes. Two fiends possessed Giovanni's,—Will and Scorn; And high they held him, till a third was born. He strove to hide the secret from himself,— But his shape rode him like some clinging elf At once too scorn'd and dreaded to be own'd. Valour, and wit, and victory enthron'd, Might bind, he thought, a woman to his worth, Beyond the threads of all the fops on earth; But on his secret soul the fiend still hung, Darken'd his face, made sour and fierce his tongue, And was preparing now a place for thee In his wild heart, O murderous Jealousy! Not without virtues was the Prince. Who is? But all were marr'd by moods and tyrannies. Brave, decent, splendid, faithful to his word, Late watching, busy with the first that stirr'd, Yet rude, sarcastic, ever in the vein To give the last thing he would suffer,—pain, He made his rank serve meanly to his gall, And thought his least good word a salve for all. Virtues in him of no such marvellous weight Claim tow'rd themselves the exercise of great. He kept no reckoning with his sweets and sours; He'd hold a sullen countenance for hours, And then if pleas'd to cheer himself a space, Look for th' immediate rapture in your face, And wonder that a cloud could still be there, How small soever, when his own was fair. Yet such is conscience, so design'd to keep Stern central watch, though fancied fast asleep, And so much knowledge of one's self there lies Cored, after all, in our complacencies, That no suspicion touch'd his temper more Than that of wanting on the generous score: He overwhelm'd it with a weight of scorn, Was proud at eve, inflexible at morn, In short, ungenerous for a week to come, And all to strike that desperate error dumb. Taste had he, in a word, for high-turn'd merit, But not the patience or the genial spirit; And so he made, 'twixt daring and defect, A sort of fierce demand on your respect,— Which, if assisted by his high degree, It gave him in some eyes a dignity, And struck a meaner deference in the small, Left him at last unlovable with all. What sort of life the bride and bridegroom led From that first jar the history hath not said: No happy one, to guess from looks constrain'd, Attentions over-wrought, and pleasures feign'd. The Prince, 'twas clear, was anxious to imply That all was love and grave felicity; The least suspicion of his pride's eclipse Blacken'd his lowering brow, and blanch'd his lips, And dreadful look'd he underneath his wrath;— Francesca kept one tranquil-seeming path, Mild with her lord, generous to high and low,— But in her heart was anger too, and woe. Paulo meantime, the Prince that fetch'd the bride, (Oh, shame that lur'd him from a brother's side!) Had learnt, I know not how, the secret snare, That gave her up to his admiring care. Some babbler, may-be, of old Guido's court, Or foolish friend had told him, half in sport; But to his heart the fatal flattery went, And grave he grew, and inwardly intent, And ran back in his mind, with sudden spring, Look, gesture, smile, speech, silence, everything, E'en what before had seem'd indifference, And read them over in another sense. Then would he blush with sudden self-disdain, To think how fanciful he was, and vain; And with half angry, half regretful sigh, Tossing his chin, and feigning a free eye, Breathe off, as 'twere, the idle tale, and look About him for his falcon or his book; Scorning that ever he should entertain One thought that in the end might give his brother pain. Not that he lov'd him much, or could; but still Brother was brother, and ill visions ill. This start, however, came so often round,— So often fell he in deep thought, and found Occasion to renew his carelessness, Yet every time the little power grown less, That by degrees, half wearied, half inclined, To the sweet struggling image he resign'd; And merely, as he thought, to make the best Of what by force would come about his breast, Began to bend down his admiring eyes On all her soul-rich looks and qualities, Turning their shapely sweetness every way, Till 'twas his food and habit day by day, And she became companion of his thought;— Oh wretched sire! thy snare has yet but half been wrought. Love by the object lov'd is soon discern'd, And grateful pity is love half return'd. Of pity for herself the rest was made, Of first impressions and belief betray'd; Of all which the unhappy sire had plann'd To fix his dove within the falcon's hand. Bright grew the morn whenever Paulo came; The only word to write was either's name; Soft in each other's presence fell their speech; Each, though they look'd not, felt they saw but each; 'Twas day, 'twas night, as either came or went, And bliss was in two hearts, with misery strangely blent. Oh, now ye gentle hearts, now think awhile, Now while ye still can think and still can smile; Thou, Paulo, most;—whom, though the most to blame, The world will visit with but half the shame. Bethink thee of the future days of one Who holds her heart the rightest heart undone. Thou holdest not thine such. Be kind and wise;— Where creeps the once frank wisdom of thine eyes? To meet e'en thus may cost her many a tear: “Meet not at all!” cries Fate, to all who love and fear. A fop there was, rich, noble, well receiv'd, Who, pleas'd to think the Princess inly griev'd, Had dar'd to hope, beside the lion's bower, Presumptuous fool! to play the paramour. Watching his time one day, when the grim lord Had left her presence with an angry word, And giving her a kind, adoring glance, The coxcomb feign'd to press her hand by chance; The Princess gaz'd a moment with calm eyes, Then bade him call the page that fann'd away the flies. For days, for weeks, the daring coward shook At dreams of daggers in the Prince's look, Till finding nothing said, the shame and fright Turn'd his conceited misery to spite. The lady's silence might itself be fear; What if there lurk'd some wondrous rival near? He watch'd.—He watch'd all movements, looks, words, sighs, And soon found cause to bless his shabby eyes. It chanc'd alas! that for some tax abhorr'd, A conquer'd district fell from its new lord; Black as a storm the Prince the frontier cross'd In fury to regain his province lost, Leaving his brother, who had been from home On state affairs, to govern in his room. Right zealous was the brother; nor had aught Yet giv'n Giovanni one mistrusting thought. He deem'd his consort cold as wintriest night, Paulo a kind of very fop of right; For though he cloak'd his own unshapeliness, And thought to glorify his power, with dress, He held all virtues, not in his rough ken, But pickthank pedantries in handsome men. The Prince had will'd, however, that his wife Should lead, till his return, a closer life, She therefore disappear'd; not pleas'd, not proud To have her judgment still no voice allow'd; Not without many a gentle hope repress'd, And tears; yet conscious that retreat was best. Besides, she lov'd the place to which she went— A bower, a nest, in which her grief had spent Its calmest time: and as it was her last As well as sweetest, and the fate comes fast That is to fill it with a dreadful cry, And make its walls ghastly to passers by, I'll hold the gentle reader for a space Ling'ring with piteous wonder in the place. A noble range it was, of many a rood, Wall'd and tree-girt, and ending in a wood. A small sweet house o'erlook'd it from a nest Of pines:—all wood and garden was the rest, Lawn, and green lane, and covert:—and it had A winding stream about it, clear and glad, With here and there a swan, the creature born To be the only graceful shape of scorn. The flower-beds all were liberal of delight; Roses in heaps were there, both red and white, Lilies angelical, and gorgeous glooms Of wall-flowers, and blue hyacinths, and blooms Hanging thick clusters from light boughs; in short, All the sweet cups to which the bees resort, With plots of grass, and leafier walks between Of red geraniums, and of jessamine, And orange, whose warm leaves so finely suit, And look as if they shade a golden fruit; And midst the flow'rs, turf'd round beneath a shade Of darksome pines, a babbling fountain play'd, And 'twixt their shafts you saw the water bright, Which through the tops glimmer'd with show'ring light. So now you stood to think what odours best Made the air happy in that lovely nest; And now you went beside the flowers, with eyes Earnest as bees, restless as butterflies; And then turn'd off into a shadier walk Close and continuous, fit for lover's talk; And then pursued the stream, and as you trod Onward and onward, o'er the velvet sod, Felt on your face an air, watery and sweet, And a new sense in your soft-lighting feet. At last you enter'd shades indeed, the wood, Broken with glens and pits, and glades far-view'd, Through which the distant palace now and then Look'd lordly forth with many-window'd ken; A land of trees,—which reaching round about In shady blessing stretch'd their old arms out; With spots of sunny openings, and with nooks To lie and read in, sloping into brooks, Where at her drink you startled the slim deer, Retreating lightly with a lovely fear. And all about, the birds kept leafy house, And sung and darted in and out the boughs; And all about, a lovely sky of blue Clearly was felt, or down the leaves laugh'd through; And here and there, in ev'ry part, were seats, Some in the open walks, some in retreats,— With bow'ring leaves o'erhead, to which the eye Look'd up half sweetly and half awfully,— Places of nestling green, for poets made, Where, when the sunshine struck a yellow shade, The rugged trunks, to inward peeping sight, Throng'd in dark pillars up the gold green light. But 'twixt the wood and flowery walks, half-way, And form'd of both, the loveliest portion lay,— A spot, that struck you like enchanted ground:— It was a shallow dell, set in a mound Of sloping orchards,—fig, and almond trees, Cherry and pine, with some few cypresses; Down by whose roots, descending darkly still, (You saw it not, but heard) there gush'd a rill, Whose low sweet talking seem'd as if it said Something eternal to that happy shade. The ground within was lawn, with fruits and flowers Heap'd towards the centre, half of citron bowers; And in the middle of those golden trees, Half seen amidst the globy oranges, Lurk'd a rare summer-house, a lovely sight,— Small, marble, well-proportion'd creamy white, Its top with vine-leaves sprinkled,—but no more,— And a young bay-tree either side the door. The door was to the wood, forward and square, The rest was domed at top and circular; And through the dome the only light came in, Ting'd as it enter'd by the vine-leaves thin. It was a beauteous piece of ancient skill, Spar'd from the rage of war, and perfect still; By some suppos'd the work of fairy hands,— Fam'd for luxurious taste, and choice of lands, Alcina or Morgana,—who from fights And errant fame inveigled amorous knights, And liv'd with them in a long round of blisses, Feasts, concerts, baths, and bower-enshaded kisses. But 'twas a temple, as its sculpture told, Built to the Nymphs that haunted there of old; For o'er the door was carv'd a sacrifice By girls and shepherds brought, with reverent eyes, Of sylvan drinks and foods, simple and sweet, And goats with struggling horns and planted feet: And round about ran, on a line with this, In like relief, a world of pagan bliss, That show'd, in various scenes, the nymphs themselves; Some by the water-side, on bowery shelves Leaning at will,—some in the stream at play,— Some pelting the young Fauns with buds of May,— Or half asleep pretending not to see The latter in the brakes come creepingly, While from their careless urns, lying aside In the long grass, the straggling waters glide. Never, be sure, before or since was seen A summer-house so fine in such a nest of green. Ah, happy place! balm of regrets and fears, E'en when thy very loveliness drew tears! The time is coming, when to hear thee nam'd Will be to make Love, Guilt, Revenge's self asham'd. All the sweet range, wood, flower-bed, grassy plot, Francesca lov'd, but most of all this spot. Whenever she walk'd forth, wherever went About the grounds, to this at last she bent: Here she had brought a lute and a few books; Here would she lie for hours, often with looks More sorrowful by far, yet sweeter too; Sometimes with firmer comfort, which she drew From sense of injury's self, and truth sustain'd: Sometimes with rarest resignation, gain'd From meek self-pitying mixtures of extremes Of hope and soft despair, and child-like dreams, And all that promising calm smile we see In Nature's face, when we look patiently. Then would she think of heaven; and you might hear Sometimes, when everything was hush'd and clear, Her sweet, rich voice from out those shades emerging, Singing the evening anthem to the Virgin. The gardeners, and the rest, who serv'd the place, And bless'd whenever they beheld her face, Knelt when they heard it, bowing and uncover'd, And felt as if in air some sainted beauty hover'd. Oh weak old man! Love, saintliest life, and she, Might all have dwelt together, but for thee. One day,—'twas on a gentle, autumn noon, When the cicale cease to mar the tune Of birds and brooks—and morning work is done, And shades have heavy outlines in the sun,— The Princess came to her accustomed bower To get her, if she could, a soothing hour; Trying, as she was used, to leave her cares Without, and slumberously enjoy the airs, And the low-talking leaves, and that cool light The vines let in, and all that hushing sight Of closing wood seen through the opening door, And distant plash of waters tumbling o'er, And smell of citron blooms, and fifty luxuries more. She tried as usual for the trial's sake, For even that diminish'd her heart-ache; And never yet, how ill soe'er at ease, Came she for nothing 'midst the flowers and trees. Yet how it was she knew not, but that day She seem'd to feel too lightly borne away,— Too much reliev'd,—too much inclin'd to draw A careless joy from everything she saw, And looking round her with a new-born eye, As if some tree of knowledge had been nigh, To taste of nature primitive and free, And bask at ease in her heart's liberty. Painfully clear those rising thoughts appear'd, With something dark at bottom that she fear'd: And turning from the trees her thoughtful look, She reach'd o'erhead, and took her down a book, And fell to reading with as fix'd an air, As though she had been wrapt since morning there. 'Twas “Launcelot of the Lake,” a bright romance, That like a trumpet made young pulses dance, Yet had a softer note that shook still more:— She had begun it but the day before, And read with a full heart, half sweet, half sad, How old King Ban was spoil'd of all he had But one fair castle: how one summer's day With his fair queen and child he went away In hopes King Arthur might resent his wrong; How reaching by himself a hill ere long, He turn'd to give his castle a last look, And saw its calm white face; and how a smoke, As he was looking, burst in volumes forth, And good King Ban saw all that he was worth, And his fair castle burning to the ground, So that his wearied pulse felt overwound, And he lay down, and said a prayer apart For those he lov'd, and broke his poor old heart. Then read she of the queen with her young child, How she came up, and nearly had gone wild, And how in journeying on in her despair, She reach'd a lake, and met a lady there, Who pitied her, and took the baby sweet Into her arms, when lo! with closing feet She sprang up all at once, like bird from brake, And vanish'd with him underneath the lake. Like stone thereat the mother stood, alas!— The fairy of the place the lady was, And Launcelot (so the boy was called) became Her pupil, till in search of knightly fame He went to Arthur's court, and play'd his part So rarely, and display'd so frank a heart, That what with all his charms of look and limb, The Queen Geneura fell in love with him:— And here, such interest in the tale she took, Francesca's eyes went deeper in the book. Ready she sat with one hand to turn o'er The leaf, to which her thoughts ran on before, The other on the table, half enwreath'd In the thick tresses over which she breath'd. So sat she fix'd, and so observ'd was she Of one, who at the door stood tenderly,— Paulo,—who from a window seeing her Go straight across the lawn, and guessing where, Had thought she was in tears, and found, that day, His usual efforts vain to keep away. Twice had he seen her since the Prince was gone, On some small matter needing unison; Twice linger'd, and convers'd, and grown long friends; But not till now where no one else attends.— “May I come in?” said he:—it made her start,— That smiling voice;—she colour'd, press'd her heart A moment, as for breath, and then with free And usual tone said,—“O yes,—certainly.” There's wont to be, at conscious times like these, An affectation of a bright-eyed ease, An air of something quite serene and sure, As if to seem so, were to be, secure. With this the lovers met, with this they spoke, With this sat down to read the self-same book, And Paulo, by degrees, gently embrac'd With one permitted arm her lovely waist; And both their cheeks, like peaches on a tree, Came with a touch together thrillingly, And o'er the book they hung, and nothing said, And every lingering page grew longer as they read. As thus they sat, and felt with leaps of heart Their colour change, they came upon the part Where fond Geneura, with her flame long nurst, Smil'd upon Launcelot, when he kiss'd her first:— That touch, at last, through every fibre slid; And Paulo turn'd, scarce knowing what he did, Only he felt he could no more dissemble, And kiss'd her, mouth to mouth, all in a tremble.— Oh then she wept,—the poor Francesca wept; And pardon oft he pray'd; and then she swept The tears away, and look'd him in the face, And, well as words might save the truth disgrace, She told him all, up to that very hour, The father's guile, th' undwelt-in bridal bower,— And wish'd for wings on which they two might soar Far, far away, as doves to their own shore, With claim from none.—That day they read no more. CANTO IV. Argument. —The lovers are betrayed to the Prince. He slays them, and sends their bodies in one hearse to Ravenna. But other thoughts, on other wings than theirs, Came bringing them, ere long, their own despairs. The spiteful fop I spoke of, he that set His eyes at work to pay his anger's debt,— This idiot, prying from a neighb'ring tower, Had watch'd the lover to the lady's bower, And flew to make a madman of her lord, Just then encamp'd with loss, a shame his soul abhorr'd. Pale first, then red, his eyes upon the stretch, Then deadly white, the husband heard the wretch, Who in soft terms, almost with lurking smile, Ran on, expressing his “regret” the while. The husband, prince, cripple, and brother heard; Then seem'd astonish'd at the man; then stirr'd His tongue but could not speak; then dash'd aside His chair as he arose, and loudly cried, “Liar and madman! thou art he was seen Risking the fangs which thou hast rush'd between. Regorge the filth in thy detested throat.” And at the word, with his huge fist he smote Like iron on the place, then seized him all, And dash'd in swoon against the bleeding wall. 'Twas dusk:—he summon'd an old chieftain stern, Giving him charge of all till his return, And with one servant got to horse and rode All night, until he reached a lone abode Not far from the green bower. Next day at noon, Through a bye-way, free to himselfe alone, Alone he rode, yet ever in disguise, His hat pull'd over his assassin eyes, And coming through the wood, there left his horse, Then down amid the fruit-trees, half by force, Made way; and by the summer house's door, Which he found shut, paus'd till a doubt was o'er. Paus'd, and gave ear. There was a low sweet voice:— The door was one that open'd without noise; And opening it, he look'd within, and saw, Nought hearing, nought suspecting, not in awe Of one created thing in earth or skies, The lovers, interchanging words and sighs, Lost in the heaven of one another's eyes. “To thee it was my father wedded me,” Francesca said:—“I never lov'd but thee. The rest was ever but an ugly dream.”— “Damn'd be the soul that says it,” cried a scream. Horror is in the room,—shrieks,—roaring cries, Parryings of feeble palms—blindly shut eyes:— What, without arms, avail'd grief, strength, despair? Or what the two poor hands put forth in prayer? Hot is the dagger from the brother's heart, Deep in the wife's:—dead both and dash'd apart, Mighty the murderer felt as there they lay; Mighty, for one huge moment, o'er his prey; Then, like a drunken man, he rode away. To tell what horror smote the people's ears, The questionings, the amaze, the many tears, The secret household thoughts, the public awe, And how those ran back shrieking, that first saw The beauteous bodies lying in the place, Bloody and dead in midst of all their grace, Would keep too long the hideous deed in sight; Back was the slayer in his camp that night; And fell next day with such a desperate sword Upon the rebel army at a ford, As sent the red news rolling to the sea, And steadied his wild nerves with victory. At court as usual then he reappear'd, Fierce, but self-centred, willing to be fear'd; Nor, saving once, at a lone chamber-door, Utter'd he word of those now seen no more, Nor dull'd his dress, nor shunn'd the being seen, But look'd, talk'd, reign'd, as they had never been. Nevertheless, his shame and misery still, Only less great than his enormous will, Darken'd his heart; and in the cloud there hung, Like some small haunting knell for ever rung, Words which contain'd a dawning mystery, “It was to thee my father wedded me.” The silence of his pride at length he broke, With handmaid then, and then with priest he spoke, And, sham'd beyond all former shame, yet rais'd From Jealousy's worst hell, his fancy gaz'd On the new scene that made his wrath less wild— The sire ensnaring his devoted child. Him foremost he beheld in all the past, And him he now ordain'd to gather all at last. One dull day, therefore, from the palace-gate, A blast of trumpets blew, like voice of fate, And all in sable clad forth came again A remnant of the former sprightly train, With churchmen intermixt; and closing all, Was a blind hearse, hung with an ermined pall, And bearing on its top, together set, A prince's and princess's coronet. Simply they came along, amidst the sighs And tears of those who looked with wondering eyes: Nor bell they had, nor choristers in white, Nor stopp'd, as most expected, within sight; But pass'd the streets, the gates, the last abode, And tow'rds Ravenna held their silent road. Before it left, the Prince had sent swift word To the old Duke of all that had occurr'd: “And though I shall not,” (so concluded he) “Otherwise touch thine age's misery, “Yet as I would that both one grave should hide, “Which must and shall not be, where I reside, “'Tis fit, though all have something to deplore, “That he who join'd them first, should keep to part no more.” The wretched father, who, when he had read This letter, felt it wither his gray head, And ever since had pac'd about his room, Trembling, and seiz'd as with approaching doom, Had given such orders as he well could frame To meet devoutly whatsoever came; And, as the news immediately took flight, Few in Ravenna went to sleep that night, But talk'd the business over, and review'd All that they knew of her, the fair and good; And so with wond'ring sorrow, the next day, Waited till they should see that sad array. The days were then at close of autumn,—still, A little rainy, and, towards nightfall, chill; There was a fitful moaning air abroad; And ever and anon, over the road, The last few leaves came fluttering from the trees, Whose trunks, wet, bare, and cold, seem'd ill at ease. The people, who, from reverence, kept at home, Listen'd till afternoon to hear them come; And hour on hour went by, and nought was heard But some chance horseman, or the wind that stirr'd, Till tow'rds the vesper hour; and then, 'twas said, Some heard a voice, which seem'd as if it read; And others said, that they could hear a sound Of many horses trampling the moist ground. Still nothing came:—till on a sudden, just As the wind open'd in a rising gust, A voice of chaunting rose, and, as it spread, They plainly heard the anthem for the dead. It was the choristers, who went to meet The train, and now were entering the first street. Then turn'd aside that city, young and old, And in their lifted hands the gushing sorrow roll'd. But of the older people few could bear To keep the window, when the train drew near; And all felt double tenderness to see The bier approaching, slow and steadily, On which those two in senseless coldness lay, Who, but some brief years since,—it seem'd a day,— Had left their walls, lovely in form and mind; In sunny manhood he,—she honor'd, fair, and kind. They say, that when Duke Guido saw them come Bringing him thus, in that one dismal sum, The whole amount of all for which his heart Had sunk the father's in the schemer's part, He rose, in private where he sate; and seem'd As though he'd walk to them, like one that dream'd, Right from the window, crying still “My child!” And from that day thenceforth he never smiled. On that same night, those lovers silently Were buried in one grave, under a tree. There, side by side, and hand in hand they lay, In the green ground; and on fine nights in May Young hearts betroth'd, used to go there, to pray. CORSO AND EMILIA. FRAGMENT OF THE STORY OF ANOTHER VICTIM TO PARENTAL DUPLICITY. 1814. It has surpris'd me often, as I write, How I, who have of late known small delight, Should thus pursue a mournful theme, and make My very solace of distress partake; Now too, while rains autumnal, as I sing, Wash the dull bars, chilling my sicklied wing, And all the climate presses on my sense; But thoughts it furnishes of things far hence, And leafy dreams afford me, and a feeling Which I should else disdain, tear-dipp'd and healing; And shows me, more than what it first design'd, How little upon earth our home we find, Or close th' intended course of erring humankind. Sorrow, they say, to one with true-touch'd ear, Is but the discord of a warbling sphere, A lurking contrast, which though harsh it be, Distils the next note more deliciously. 'Tis hard to think it, till the note be heard, A joy too often and too long deferr'd. Yet come it will, hereafter, if not here; And good meantime comes best from many a tear. Tales like the present, of a real woe, From bitter seed to balmy fruitage grow: The woes were few, were brief, have long been past; The warnings they bequeath spread wide and last. And even they, whose shatter'd hearts and frames Make them unhappiest of poetic names, What are they, if they know their calling high, But crush'd perfumes exhaling to the sky? Or weeping clouds, that but awhile are seen, Yet keep the earth they haste to bright and green? Three months have pass'd;—how pass'd, remains unknown; But never now, companion'd or alone, Comes the sweet lady to her summer bower. Corso did once, arm'd with the sterner power Of a man's grief. He saw it; but how look'd The bow'r at him! His presence felt rebuk'd. It seem'd as if the hopes of his young heart, His kindness, and his generous scorn of art, Had all been a fop's dream, or at the best Poor weak half virtues that could stand no test, And that on waking from his idle fit, He found himself (how could he think of it!) A selfish boaster, and a hypocrite. That thought before had griev'd him, but the pain Cut sharp and sudden, now it came again. Sick thoughts of late had made his body sick, And this, in turn, to them grown strangely quick; And pale he stood, and seem'd to burst all o'er Into moist anguish never felt before, And with a dreadful certainty to know His peace was gone, and all to come was woe; Come too to her! doom'd, and by him, to bear, In the dire lot, poor woman's direr share!— It seem'd as if horrors thus heap'd must find Some props, or they would crush his brain-sick mind: And find they did, not what the worse disease Of want of charity calls sophistries,— Nor what can cure a generous heart of pain,— But humble guesses, helping to sustain. He thought of things, whose love we seldom heed, Till sin or sorrow make the help a need,— Of habit, circumstance, design, degree, Merit, and will, and boundless charity; And these, although they push'd down, as they rose, His self-respect, and all those morning shows Of true and perfect, which his youth had built, Push'd with them too the worst of hopeless guilt; Till youth, and natural vigour, and the dread Of self-betrayal, and a thought that spread From time to time in gladness o'er his face, That sacrifice of self would earn them grace, Help'd to restore him to his wonted life, Though restless still, and with his looks at strife; And he would rise betimes, day after day, And greeting his blithe courser, ride away, Seemingly blithe as he, gazing about On tow'r and cot, to force his thoughts without; And when he found it vain, would pierce the shade Of some enwooded field or closer glade, And there dismounting, idly sit, and sigh, Or pluck the grass beside him with vague eye, And almost envy the poor beast, that went Cropping it, here and there, with dumb content. But thus, at least, he exercis'd his blood, And kept it livelier than inaction could; And thus he earned for his thought-working head The power of sleeping when he went to bed, And was enabled still to wear away That task of loaded hearts, another day. But she, the gentler frame,—the shaken flower,— The daughter, sacrificed in evil hour,— The struggling, virtue-loving, fallen she, Wife that still was, and mother that might be,— What could she do, unable thus to keep Her strength alive, but sit, and think, and weep, Forever stooping o'er her broidery frame, Half blind, and longing till the night-time came, When worn and wearied out with the day's sorrow She might be still and senseless till the morrow! And oh, the morrow, how it used to rise! How would she open her despairing eyes, And from the sense of the long lingering day Rushing upon her, almost turn away, Loathing the light, and groan to sleep again! Then sighing once for all, to meet the pain, She would get up in haste, and try to pass The time in patience, wretched as it was; Till patience self, in her distemper'd sight, Would seem a charm to which she had no right, And trembling at the lip, and pale with fears, She shook her head, and burst into fresh tears. Old comforts now were not at her command: The falcon stoop'd in vain to court her hand; The flowers were not refresh'd; the very light, The sunshine, seem'd as if it shone at night; The least noise smote her like a sudden wound; And did she hear but the remotest sound Of song or instrument about the place, She hid with both her hands her streaming face. But worse to her than all (and oh! thought she, That ever, ever, such a worse should be!) The sight of infant was, or child at play; Then would she turn, and move her lips, and pray, That Heaven would take her, if it pleas'd, away. Meantime her lord, who by her long distress Seem'd wrought, at first, to some true tenderness, Which, to his sore amaze, did but appear To vex her more than when he was severe, Began, with helps of wondering tongues, to see In moods (he thought) so bent to disagree, And in all else she look'd and said, and all His brother did, who now in bower or hall Seldom dar'd trust his still ingenuous face,— The secret of a sure and dire disgrace. What a convulsion was the first belief! Astonishment, abasement, profound grief, Self-pity, almost tears, thence self-disdain For stooping to so weak and vile a pain, With mad impatience to surmount the blow In some retributive and bloody woe,— All rush'd upon him, like the sudden view Of some new world, foreign to all he knew, Where he had wak'd and found the dreams of madmen true. If any lingering hope that he was wrong, Pride's self would needs hold fast, 'twas not so long. One dawn, as sullenly awake he lay, Considering what to do the approaching day; He heard his wife say something in her sleep,— He shook, and listened;—she began to weep, And moaning louder, seem'd to shake her head, Till all at once articulate, she said, “He loves his brother yet.—Dear Heaven, 'twas I—” Then lower voiced—“Only do let me die.” With the worst impulse of his whole fierce life The husband glared, one moment, on his wife: Then grasp'd a crucifix, and look'd no more. He dresses, takes two swords, and through the door Goes, like a spirit, in the morning air;— His squire awak'd attends; and they repair, Silent as wonder, to his brother's room:— His squire calls him up too; and forth they come. The brothers meet,—Lorenzo scarce in breath, Yet firm and fierce, Corso as pale as death. The husband, motioning while turning round, To lead the way, said, “To the tilting ground.” “There, brother,” answer'd Corso, while despair Rush'd on his face. “Yes, brother,” cried he, “there.” The word smote crushingly; and paler still, He bowed, and moved his lips, as waiting on his will. 'Twas a fresh autumn dawn, vigorous and chill; The lightsome morning star was sparkling still, Ere it turn'd in to heaven; and far away Appear'd the streaky fingers of the day. An opening in the trees took Corso's eye, As mute his brother and himself went by: It was a glimpse of the tall wooded mound That screen'd Emilia's favourite spot of ground: Massy and dark in the clear dawning stood, As in a lingering sleep, the solemn wood; And through the bowering arch, which led inside, He almost fancied once, that he descried A marble gleam, where the pavilion lay— Starting he turn'd, and look'd another way. Arriv'd, and waving the two squires apart, Then pressing with his hand his labouring heart, The Prince spoke low and close, (and as he spoke His voice with breathless and pale passion broke,) “Sleep hath reveal'd a villain,” were his words: Then gave his paler brother one of the two swords. Corso's heart rose, exalted with despair; He drew a little back; and with the air Of one who would do well, not from the right To be well thought of, but in guilt's despite, Answer'd, “The sword is sheath'd. So rest it ever. Misery's self shall fight no brother. Never.” “How!” with uplifted voice, exclaim'd the other; “Hideous pretence! who bade you fight a brother? Brother? O wretch! O traitor to the name! Dash'd in thy teeth, and cursed be the claim. What! wound it deepest? strike me to the core, Me, and the hopes which I can have no more, And then as never brother of mine could, Shrink from the letting a few drops of blood?” “It is not so,” cried Corso, “'tis not so; “But I would save you from a further woe.” “A further woe, recreant!” retorted he: “What woe? what further? yes, one still may be! Save me the woe, save me the dire disgrace, Of seeing one of an illustrious race Bearing about a heart, which fear'd no law, And a vile sword, which yet he dared not draw.” “Brother, dear brother!” Corso cried, “nay, nay. I'll use the word no more;—but peace, I pray! You trample on a soul, sunk at your feet!” “'Tis false!” exclaim'd the prince; “'tis a retreat To which you fly, when manly wrongs pursue, And fear the grave you bring a woman to.” With sudden start, and then with bow'd, meek look Waiving the charge, yet not its worst rebuke, Th' offender sigh'd; then rose without a word, And drew, and kiss'd the cross'd hilt of his sword, Looking to heaven;—then, with a steady brow, Mild, yet not feeble, said, “I'm ready now.” “A noble word!” exclaim'd the prince, and smote The ground beneath him with his firming foot:— The squires rush in between, in their despair, But both the princes tell them to beware. “Back, Gerard,” cries Lorenzo; “I require “No teacher here, but an observant squire.” “Back, Tristan,” Corso cries; “fear not for me; “All is not worst that so appears to thee. “And here,” said he, “a word.” The poor youth came, Starting in sweeter tears to hear his name: A whisper, and a charge there seem'd to be, Giv'n to him kindly yet inflexibly: Both squires then drew apart again, and stood Mournfully both, each in his several mood,— One half in rage, as to himself he speaks, The other with the tears streaming down both his cheeks. The prince attack'd with nerve in every limb, Nor seem'd the other slow to match with him; Yet as the fight grew warm, 'twas evident, One only of the two on blood was bent: Lorenzo press'd, and push'd, and shifted aim, And play'd his weapon like a tongue of flame; Corso retir'd, and warded, turn'd on heel, And led him, step by step, round like a wheel; Sometimes indeed he feign'd an angrier start, But still relaps'd, and play'd his former part. “What!” cried Lorenzo, who grew still more fierce, “Fighting in sport? Playing your cart and tierce?” “Not so, my prince,” said Corso; “have a care “How you think so, or I shall wound you there.” He stamp'd, and watching as he spoke the word, Drove, with his breast, full on his brother's sword. 'Twas done. He stagger'd; and in falling prest Lorenzo's foot with his right hand and breast: Then on his elbow turn'd, and raising t'other, He smil'd and said, “No fault of yours, my brother; An accident—a slip—the finishing one To errors by that poor old man begun. You'll not—you'll not”—his heart leap'd on before, And chok'd his utterance; but he smil'd once more, For as his hand grew lax, he felt it prest;— And so, his dim eyes sliding into rest, He turn'd him round, and dropt with hiding head, And in that loosening drop his spirit fled. But noble passion touch'd Lorenzo's soul; He seem'd to feel the clouds of habit roll Away from him at once, with all their scorn, And out he spoke, in the clear air of morn:— “By heaven, by heaven, and all the better part Of us poor creatures with a human heart, I trust we reap at last, as well as plough;— But there, meantime, my brother, liest thou: And, Corso, thou wert the completest knight, That ever rode with banner to the fight; And thou wert the most beautiful to see, That ever came in press of chivalry; And of a sinful man, thou wert the best, That ever for his friend put spear in rest; And thou wert the most meek and cordial, That ever among ladies ate in hall; And thou wert still, for all that bosom gor'd, The kindest man that ever struck with sword.” At this the words forsook his tongue; and he, Who scarcely had shed tears since infancy, Felt his stern visage thrill, and meekly bow'd His head, and for his brother wept aloud. The squires with glimmering tears—Tristan, at first, Trying, with greedy search, to doubt the worst, Double their scarfs about the fatal wound, And lift the corse, and wait to quit the ground. Lorenzo starts; and motioning to take The way they came, follows his brother back, And having seen him laid upon the bed, No further look he gave him, nor tear shed, But went away, such as he used to be, With looks of stately will and calm austerity. Tristan, who when he was to make the best Of something sad and not to be redress'd, Could show a heart as firm as it was kind, Now lock'd his tears up, and seem'd all resign'd, And to Emilia's chamber took his way, To tell the message of that mortal day. He found her ladies, up and down the stairs, Moving with noiseless caution, and in tears, And that the news, though to herself unknown, On its old wings of vulgar haste had flown. The door, as tenderly as miser's purse, Was opened by the pale and aged nurse, Who shaking her old head, and pressing close Her wither'd lips to keep the tears that rose, Made signs she guess'd what grief he came about, And so his arm squeez'd gently, and went out. The princess, who had pass'd a fearful night, Toiling with dreams,—fright crowding upon fright, Had miss'd her husband at that early hour, And would have ris'n, but found she wanted power. Yet as her body seem'd to go, her mind Felt, though in anguish still, strangely resign'd; And moving not, nor weeping, mute she lay, Wasting in patient gravity away. The nurse, sometime before, with gentle creep Had drawn the curtains, hoping she might sleep: But suddenly she ask'd, though not with fear, “Nina, what bustle's that I seem to hear?” And the poor creature, who the news had heard, Pretending to be busy, had just stirr'd Something about the room, and answer'd not a word. “Who's there?” said that sweet voice, kindly and clear, Which in its stronger days was joy to hear:— Its weakness now almost depriv'd the squire Of his new firmness, but approaching nigher, “Madam,” said he, “'tis I; one who may say, He loves his friends more than himself to-day;— Tristan.”—She paus'd a little, and then said— “Tristan, my friend, what noise thus haunts my head? Something I'm sure has happen'd—tell me what— I can bear all, though you may fancy not.” “Madam,” replied the squire, “you are, I know, All sweetness—pardon me for saying so. My master bade me say then,” resum'd he, “That he spoke firmly when he told it me,— That I was, also, madam, to your ear Firmly to speak, and you firmly to hear,— That he was forced this day, whether or no, To combat with the prince; and that although His noble brother was no fratricide, Yet in that fight, and on his sword,—he died.” “I understand,” with firmness answer'd she, More low in voice, but still composedly. “Now, Tristan—faithful friend—leave me; and take This trifle here, and keep it for my sake.” So saying, from the curtains she put forth Her thin white hand, that held a ring of worth; And he, with tears no longer to be kept From quenching his heart's thirst, silently wept, And kneeling, took the ring, and touch'd her hand To either streaming eye with homage bland, And looking on it once, gently up started, And in his reverent stillness so departed. Her favourite lady then with the old nurse Return'd, and fearing she must now be worse, Gently withdrew the curtains, and look'd in:— O, who that knows where faults may first begin, Shall bid not earth be just, before 'tis hard, with sin? There lay she praying, upwardly intent, Like a fair statue on a monument, With her two trembling hands together prest, Palm against palm, and pointing from her breast, She ceas'd; and turning slowly tow'rds the wall, They saw her tremble sharply, feet and all,— Then suddenly be still. Near and more near They bent with pale inquiry and close ear; Her eyes were shut—no motion—not a breath— The gentle sufferer was at peace in death. HERO AND LEANDER. 1818. CANTO I. Old is the tale I tell, and yet as young And warm with life as ever minstrel sung: Two lovers fill it,—two fair shapes—two souls. Sweet as the last for whom the death-bell tolls: What matters it how long ago, or where They liv'd, or whether their young locks of hair, Like English hyacinths, or Greek, were curl'd? We hurt the stories of the antique world By thinking of our school-books, and the wrongs Done them by pedants and fantastic songs, Or sculptures, which from Roman “studios” thrown, Turn back Deucalion's flesh and blood to stone. Truth is forever truth, and love is love; The bird of Venus is the living dove. Sweet Hero's eyes, three thousand years ago, Were made precisely like the best we know, Look'd the same looks, and spoke no other Greek Than eyes of honey-moons begun last week. Alas! and the dread shock that stunn'd her brow Strain'd them as wide as any wretch's now. I never think of poor Leander's fate, And how he swam, and how his bride sat late, And watch'd the dreadful dawning of the light, But as I would of two that died last night. So might they now have liv'd, and so have died; The story's heart, to me, still beats against its side. Beneath the sun which shines this very hour, There stood of yore—behold it now—a tow'r, Half set in trees and leafy luxury, And through them look'd a window on the sea. The tow'r is old, but guards a beauteous scene Of bow'rs, 'twixt purple hills, a gulf of green, Whose farthest side, from out a lifted grove, Shows a white temple to the Queen of Love. Fair is the morn, the soft trees kiss and breathe; Calm, blue, and glittering is the sea beneath; And by the window a sweet maiden sits, Grave with glad thoughts, and watching it by fits, For o'er that sea, drawn to her with delight, Her love Leander is to come at night; To come, not sailing, or with help of oar, But with his own warm heart and arms—no more— A naked bridegroom, bound from shore to shore. A priestess Hero is, an orphan dove, Lodg'd in that turret of the Queen of Love; A youth Leander, borne across the strait, Whose wealthy kin deny him his sweet mate, Beset with spies, and dogg'd with daily spite; But he has made high compact with delight, And found a wondrous passage through the weltering night. So sat she fix'd all day, or now was fain To rise and move, then sighs, then sits again; Then tries some work, forgets it, and thinks on, Wishing with perfect love the time were gone, And lost to the green trees with their sweet singers, Taps on the casement's ledge with idle fingers. An aged nurse had Hero in the place, An under priestess of an humbler race, Who partly serv'd, partly kept watch and ward Over the rest, but no good love debarr'd. The temple's faith though serious, never cross'd Engagements, miss'd to their exchequer's cost; And though this present knot was to remain Unknown awhile, 'twas bless'd within the fane, And much good thanks expected in the end From the dear married daughter, and the wealthy friend. Poor Hero look'd for no such thanks. Her hand, But to be held in his, would have giv'n sea and land. The reverend crone accordingly took care To do her duty to a time so fair, Saw all things right, secur'd her own small pay, (Which brought her luxuries to her dying day,) And finishing a talk, which with surprise She saw made grave e'en those good-humour'd eyes, Laid up, tow'rds night, her service on the shelf, And left her nicer mistress to herself. Hesper meanwhile, the star with amorous eye, Shot his fine sparkle from the deep blue sky. A depth of night succeeded, dark, but clear, Such as presents the hollow starry sphere, Like a high gulf to heaven; and all above Seems waking to a fervid work of love. A nightingale, in transport, seem'd to fling His warble out, and then sit listening: And ever and anon, amidst the flush Of the thick leaves, there ran a breezy gush; And then, from dewy myrtles lately bloom'd, An odour small, in at the window fumed. At last, with twinkle o'er a distant tower, A star appear'd that was to show the hour. The virgin saw; and going to a room Which held an altar burning with perfume, Cut off a lock of her dark solid hair, And laid it, with a little whisper'd prayer, Before a statue, that of marble bright Sat smiling downwards o'er the rosy light. Then at the flame a torch of pine she lit, And o'er her head anxiously holding it, Ascended to the roof; and leaning there, Lifted its light into the darksome air. The boy beheld,—beheld it from the sea, And parted his wet locks, and breath'd with glee, And rose, in swimming, more triumphantly. Smooth was the sea that night, the lover strong, And in the springy waves he danc'd along. He rose, he dipp'd his breast, he aim'd, he cut With his clear arms, and from before him put The parting waves, and in and out the air His shoulders felt, and trail'd his washing hair; But when he saw the torch, oh, how he sprung, And thrust his feet against the waves, and flung The foam behind, as though he scorn'd the sea, And parted his wet locks, and breath'd with glee, And rose, and panted, most triumphantly! Arriv'd at last on shallow ground, he saw The stooping light, as if in haste, withdraw: Again it issued just above the door, With a white hand, and vanish'd as before. Then rising, with a sudden-ceasing sound Of wateriness, he stood on the firm ground, And treading up a little slippery bank, With jutting myrtles mix'd, and verdure dank, Came to a door ajar,—all hush'd, all blind With darkness; yet he guess'd who stood behind; And entering with a turn, the breathless boy A breathless welcome finds, and words that die for joy. CANTO II. Thus pass'd the summer shadows in delight: Leander came as surely as the night, And when the morning woke upon the sea, It saw him not, for back at home was he. Sometimes, when it blew fresh, the struggling flare Seem'd out; but then he knew his Hero's care, And that she only wall'd it with her cloak; Brighter again from out the dark it broke. Sometimes the night was almost clear as day, Wanting no torch; and then, with easy play, He dipp'd along beneath the silver moon, Placidly heark'ning to the water's tune. The people round the country, who from far Used to behold the light, thought it a star, Set there perhaps by Venus as a wonder, To mark the favourite maiden who slept under. Therefore they trod about the grounds by day Gently; and fishermen at night, they say, With reverence kept aloof, cutting their silent way. But autumn now was over; and the crane Began to clang against the coming rain, And peevish winds ran cutting o'er the sea, Which oft return'd a face of enmity. The gentle girl, before he went away, Would look out sadly toward the cold-eyed day And often beg him not to come that night; But still he came, and still she bless'd his sight; And so, from day to day, he came and went, Till time had almost made her confident. One evening, as she sat, twining sweet bay And myrtle garlands for a holiday, And watch'd at intervals the dreary sky, In which the dim sun held a languid eye, She thought with such a full and quiet sweetness Of all Leander's love and his completeness, All that he was, and said, and look'd, and dared, His form, his step, his noble head full-hair'd, And how she lov'd him, as a thousand might, And yet he earn'd her still thus night by night, That the sharp pleasure mov'd her like a grief, And tears came dropping with their meek relief. Meantime the sun had sunk; the hilly mark, Across the straits, mix'd with the mightier dark, And night came on. All noises by degrees Were hush'd,—the fisher's call, the birds, the trees, All but the washing of the eternal seas. Hero look'd out, and trembling augur'd ill, The darkness held its breath so very still. But yet she hop'd he might arrive before The storm began, or not be far from shore; And crying, as she stretch'd forth in the air, “Bless him!” she turn'd and said a tearful prayer, And mounted to the tower, and shook the torch's flare. But he, Leander, almost half across, Threw his blithe locks behind him with a toss, And hail'd the light victoriously, secure Of clasping his kind love, so sweet and sure; When suddenly, a blast, as if in wrath, Sheer from the hills, came headlong on his path, Then started off; and driving round the sea, Dashed up the panting waters roaringly. The youth at once was thrust beneath the main, With blinded eyes, but quickly rose again, And with a smile at heart, and stouter pride, Surmounted like a god, the rearing tide. But what? The torch gone out! So long too! See, He thinks it comes! Ah, yes,—'tis she! 'tis she! Again he springs; and though the winds arise Fiercer and fiercer, swims with ardent eyes; And always, though with ruffian waves dash'd hard, Turns thither with glad groan his stout regard; And always, though his sense seems wash'd away, Emerges, fighting tow'rds the cordial ray. But driven about at last, and drench'd the while, The noble boy loses that inward smile: For now, from one black atmosphere, the rain Sweeps into stubborn mixture with the main; And the brute wind, unmuffling all its roar, Storms;—and the light, gone out, is seen no more. Then dreadful thoughts of death, of waves heap'd on him, And friends, and parting daylight, rush upon him. He thinks of prayers to Neptune and his daughters, And Venus, Hero's queen, sprung from the waters; And then of Hero only,—how she fares, And what she'll feel, when the blank morn appears; And at that thought he stiffens once again His limbs, and pants, and strains, and climbs,—in vain. Fierce draughts he swallows of the wilful wave, His tossing hands are lax, his blind look grave, Till the poor youth (and yet no coward he) Spoke once her name, and yielding wearily, Wept in the middle of the scornful sea. I need not tell how Hero, when her light Would burn no longer, pass'd that dreadful night; How she exclaim'd, and wept, and could not sit One instant in one place; nor how she lit The torch a hundred times, and when she found 'Twas all in vain, her gentle head turn'd round Almost with rage; and in her fond despair She tried to call him through the deafening air. But when he came not,—when from hour to hour He came not,—though the storm had spent its power, And when the casement, at the dawn of light, Began to show a square of ghastly white, She went up to the tower, and straining out To search the seas, downwards, and round about, She saw, at last,—she saw her lord indeed Floating, and wash'd about, like a vile weed; On which such strength of passion and dismay Seiz'd her, and such an impotence to stay, That from the turret, like a stricken dove, With fluttering arms she leap'd, and join'd her drownèd love. THE PANTHER. 1818. The panther leap'd to the front of his lair, And stood with a foot up, and snuff'd the air; He quiver'd his tongue from his panting mouth, And look'd with a yearning towards the south; For he scented afar in the coming breeze News of the gums and their blossoming trees; And out of Armenia that same day He and his race came bounding away. Over the mountains and down to the plains Like Bacchus's panthers with wine in their veins, They came where the woods wept odorous rains; And there, with a quivering, every beast Fell to his old Pamphylian feast. The people who liv'd not far away, Heard the roaring on that same day; And they said, as they lay in their carpeted rooms, “The panthers are come, and are drinking the gums;” And some of them going with swords and spears To gather their share of the rich round tears, The panther I spoke of follow'd them back; And dumbly they let him tread close in the track, And lured him after them into the town; And then they let the portcullis down, And took the panther, which happened to be The largest was seen in all Pamphily. By every one there was the panther admir'd, So fine was his shape and so sleekly attir'd, And such an air, both princely and swift, He had, when giving a sudden lift To his mighty paw, he'd turn at a sound, And so stand panting and looking around, As if he attended a monarch crown'd. And truly, they wonder'd the more to behold About his neck a collar of gold, On which was written, in characters broad, “Arsaces the king to the Nysian God.” So they tied to the collar a golden chain, Which made the panther a captive again, And by degrees he grew fearful and still, As though he had lost his lordly will. But now came the spring, when free-born love Calls up nature in forest and grove, And makes each thing leap forth, and be Loving, and lovely, and blithe as he. The panther he felt the thrill of the air, And he gave a leap up, like that at his lair; He felt the sharp sweetness more strengthen his veins Ten times than ever the spicy rains, And ere they're aware, he has burst his chains: He has burst his chains, and ah, ha! he's gone, And the links and the gazers are left alone, And off to the mountains the panther's flown. Now what made the panther a prisoner be? Lo! 'twas the spices and luxury. And what set that lordly panther free? 'Twas Love!—'twas Love!—'twas no one but he. MAHMOUD. 1823. TO RICHARD HENRY HORNE. Horne, hear a theme that should have had its dues From thine own passionate and thoughtful Muse. There came a man, making his hasty moan Before the Sultan Mahmoud on his throne, And crying out—“My sorrow is my right, And I will see the Sultan, and to-night.” “Sorrow,” said Mahmoud, “is a reverend thing: I recognise its right, as king with king; Speak on.” “A fiend has got into my house,” Exclaim'd the staring man, “and tortures us: One of thine officers;—he comes, the abhorr'd, And takes possession of my house, my board, My bed:—I have two daughters and a wife, And the wild villain comes, and makes me mad with life.” “Is he there now?” said Mahmoud:—“No; he left The house when I did, of my wits bereft; And laugh'd me down the street, because I vow'd I'd bring the prince himself to lay him in his shroud, I'm mad with want, I'm mad with misery, And oh, thou Sultan Mahmoud, God cries out for thee!” The Sultan comforted the man, and said, “Go home, and I will send thee wine and bread,” (For he was poor), “and other comforts. Go; And should the wretch return, let Sultan Mahmoud know.” In two days' time, with haggard eyes and beard, And shaken voice, the suitor reappear'd, And said “He's come.”—Mahmoud said not a word, But rose, and took four slaves, each with a sword, And went with the vex'd man. They reach the place, And hear a voice, and see a female face, That to the window flutter'd in affright. “Go in,” said Mahmoud, “and put out the light; But tell the females first to leave the room; And when the drunkard follows them, we come.” The man went in. There was a cry, and hark! A table falls, the window is struck dark; Forth rush the breathless women; and behind With curses comes the fiend in desperate mind. In vain: the sabres soon cut short the strife, And chop the shrieking wretch, and drink his bloody life. “Now light the light,” the Sultan cried aloud. 'Twas done; he took it in his hand, and bow'd Over the corpse, and look'd upon the face; Then turn'd and knelt beside it in the place, And said a prayer, and from his lips there crept Some gentle words of pleasure, and he wept. In reverent silence the spectators wait, Then bring him at his call both wine and meat; And when he had refresh'd his noble heart, He bade his host be blest, and rose up to depart. The man amaz'd, all mildness now, and tears, Fell at the Sultan's feet, with many prayers, And begg'd him to vouchsafe to tell his slave, The reason first of that command he gave About the light; then when he saw the face, Why he knelt down; and lastly, how it was, That fare so poor as his detain'd him in the place. The Sultan said, with much humanity, “Since first I saw thee come, and heard thy cry, I could not rid me of a dread, that one By whom such daring villanies were done, Must be some lord of mine, perhaps a lawless son. Whoe'er he was, I knew my task, but fear'd A father's heart, in case the worst appear'd. For this I had the light put out. But when I saw the face, and found a stranger slain, I knelt and thank'd the sovereign arbiter, Whose work I had perform'd through pain and fear; And then I rose, and was refresh'd with food, The first time since thou cam'st, and marr'dst my solitude.” THE GENTLE ARMOUR; OR, THREE KNIGHTS IN STEEL AGAINST ONE IN LINEN. 1831. The main circumstance of this story—a knight fighting against three, with no other coat of mail than the delicatest garment of his mistress —is taken from one of the Fabliaux that were versified by the late Mr. Way. The lady's appearance in the garment, after the battle, is from the same poem. The turn given to these incidents, the colouring, and the sentiment, are the work of the present writer. The original is a curious specimen of the license of old times. A married woman, who has a good-humoured craven for her husband, is made love to by three knights; to each of whom, as a trial of his affection, and by way of proving the tenderness of her deserts, she proposes that he shall mix in the fight of a tournament, with no other covering to his body than the one just mentioned. Two of them decline the experiment; the third accepts it, is victorious, and, in order to be on a par with her in delicacy of sentiment, requests that she will make her appearance at her husband's table in the triumphant investment. She does so; the guests are struck with admiration; “While the good spouse (not bold, 'twas lately sung) Cast down his honest eyes, and held his tongue. “Speak, guileless damsels! Dames, in love well read! Speak, Sirs! in chivalry and honour bred; Who best deserves—the lady or the knight? He death who braved, or she, censorious spite?” Allowance is to be made for the opinions of a different age; and we see, even here, right and wrong principles struggling in the perplexities of custom. But the cultivation of brute force is uppermost; and nothing can reconcile us to the disposition of the woman who could speculate upon such a tribute to her vanity. It is hoped that the heroine of the following version of the story, without being wanting in self-love, is a little better, and not unsuited to any age. It has been thought by some persons (and I am ashamed for their sakes, not for my own, to say it) that the leading subject of the poem, a shift, is unfit for relation! In the name of common sense and modesty, on what ground? I confess I should think very ill of any mind, not perverted in its ideas by the worst kind of town life, that could entertain so unworthy a fancy. Most assuredly I wrote for no such persons, but for the innocent, the noble, and the wise. I certainly, especially after such warning, would not read the poem to everybody. I would not have read it, for instance, had I lived in their days, to the club-rooms of Tom Brown and Tom D'Urfey; and I might have had doubts of the audiences of Mrs. Behn and Mrs. Centlivre; but I could have read it with pleasure (literary modesty apart) to Addison and Steele, to Atterbury and Berkeley, to their wives and to their daughters. I would have said nothing about the story in the circles of King Charles the Second, male or female; nothing to the Buckinghams and Rochesters, or the Duchesses of Cleveland and Portsmouth; but I would have repeated it without hesitation to Cowley, to Evelyn, to Andrew Marvel, to Milton himself, and to every woman whom they respected;—to Lady Fanshawe, and to Lucy Hutchinson. “No thought infirm,” I would be sworn, would have “altered their cheek.” They would have thought of nothing but the sentiment, and virtues, and nobleness of the story. With those only would cheeks like theirs have glowed. Of some imaginable living readers, equally refined, it does not become me to speak; but I may add, that “those poor, noble, wounded, and sick men,” who are suffering for us in the East, would find the achievements, and probably the affections of the story, too much like some of their own to disrespect them: nor do I believe it would be despised even by the divine women who have gone to pour balm into their wounds. CANTO I. A lady's gift I sing, which meant in blame, His glorious hauberk to a knight became, And in the field such dire belabouring bore, As gentle armour never stood before; A song of love, fit for the purest ears, With smiles begun and clos'd, and manhood in the tears. There liv'd a knight, when knighthood was in flow'r, Who charm'd alike the tilt-yard and the bow'r; Young, handsome, blythe, loyal and brave of course, He stuck as firmly to his friend as horse; And only show'd, for so complete a youth, Somewhat too perfect a regard for truth. He own'd 'twas inconvenient; sometimes felt A wish 'twere buckled in another's belt; Doubted its modesty, its use, its right, Yet after all remain'd the same true knight: So potent is a custom early taught; And to such straits may honest men be brought. 'Tis true, to be believ'd was held a claim Of gentle blood, and not to be, a shame:— A liar, notorious as the noonday sun, Was bound to fight you, if you call'd him one:— But yet to be so nice, and stand, profess'd, All truth, was held a pedantry at best; Invidious by the men; and by the fair A thing at once to dote on and beware. What bliss to meet his flatteries, eye to eye! But could he not, then, tell one little lie? At length, our hero found, to take his part, A lovely girl, a quick and virgin heart, One that believ'd what any friend averr'd, Much more the whisp'rer of earth's sweetest word. He lov'd her for her cordial, trusting ways, Her love of love, and readiness to praise; And she lov'd him because he told her so, And truth makes true love doubly sweet to know. It chanc'd this lady in relation stood To one as beautiful, but not so good, Who had been blaz'd, for what indeed she was, By a young lord, over his hippocras, Her lover once, but now so far from tender, He swore he'd kick her very least defender. The world look'd hard for some one of her kin To teach this spark to look to his own skin; But no one came: the lady wept for spite: At length her cousin ask'd it of the knight. The knight look'd troubled to the last degree, Turn'd pale, then red, but said it could not be. With many sighs he said it, many pray'rs To be well construed—nay, at last with tears: And own'd a knight might possibly be better, Who read the truth less nicely to the letter; But 'twas his weakness—'twas his education,— A dying priest had taught him, his relation, A kind of saint, who meant him for the church, And thus had left his breeding in the lurch; The good old man! he lov'd him, and took blame (He own'd it) thus to mix his love with shame: “But oh reflect, my sweet one,” cried the youth, “How you yourself have lov'd me for my truth; How I love you for loving it, and how Secure it makes us of our mutual vow. To feel this hand, to look into those eyes,— It makes me feel as sure as of the earth and skies.” “I did love, and I do,” the lady cried, With hand but half allow'd, and cheek aside; “But then I thought you took me at my word, And would have scorn'd what I pronounc'd absurd. My cousin's wrong'd; I'm sure of it; do you Be sure as well, and show what you can do: Let but one mind be seen betwixt us two.” In vain our hero, while his aspect glow'd To hear these lovely words, the difference show'd 'Twixt her kind wishes and an ill desert: The more he talk'd, the more her pride was hurt, Till rais'd from glow to glow, and tear to tear, And pique to injury, she spoke of fear. “Fear!” cried the knight, blushing because he blush'd, While sorrow through his gaze in wonder rush'd; “Had I been present when this lord was heard, I might perhaps have stopp'd him with a word; One word (had I suspected it) to show How ignorant you were of what all know; And with what passion you could take the part Of one, unworthy of your loving heart: But when I know the truth, and know that he Knew not, nor thought, of either you or me, And when I'm call'd on, and in open day, To swear that true is false, and yea is nay, And know I'm in a lie, and yet go through it, By all that's blest I own I cannot do it. Let me but feel me buckled for the right, And come a world in arms, I'm still a knight: But give my foe the truth, and me the fraud, And the pale scholar of the priest is awed.” “Say not the word,” the hasty fair one cried: “I see it all, and wish I might have died. Go, Sir, oh go! a soldier and afraid! Was it for this you lov'd a trusting maid? Your presence kills me, Sir, with shame and grief.”— She said; and sunk in tears and handkerchief. “Ah, Mabel,” said the knight, as with a kiss He bow'd on her dropp'd head, “you'll mourn for this.” He look'd upon her glossy locks, admir'd Their gentleness for once, and with a sigh retir'd. From day to day Sir Hugh has paced his floor, Look'd out of window, listen'd at the door, Wrote twice; wrote thrice; learnt of her health; took up His lute, his book; fill'd, and forgot, a cup; Tried all but pride, and found no comfort still: Lov'd him she had, but more had loved her will. It chanc'd a short time after, that the king Proclaim'd a joust at the return of spring: The suburb was all hammers, boards, and crowd; The knights and tailors pleas'd, the ladies proud; All but our hero, and the cousins twain, Who nurs'd their several sullenness of pain, And tore in secret much their mental hair; The ladies that they had no lovers there, The gentle knight in amorous despair. The lord who had denounc'd the light one's name, Seeing no step to vindicate her fame, And hearing of her cousin's broken vow, Would laugh, and lift his shoulders and his brow, And talk of tricks that run in families; And then he'd lift his glass, and looking wise, Drink to the health of “Truth betwixt two Lies.” Two fluster'd fools, though brave, and men of birth, There were, who join'd in this unseemly mirth; Fellows who knew, and knew it to their shame, The worth of one, and chaff of t'other dame. These clubb'd their jealousies, revenge, and spite, Till broad the scandal grew, and reach'd the knight. Our lover heard with mingled rage and joy, Then rose from out his grief, and call'd his boy, (A pretty page with letter-bearing face,) And wrote his mistress to implore her grace; Her grace and pardon to implore, and some Small favour for the battle, now to come,— A glove, a string, aught but a cruel No, To plume his next day's pounce upon the foe. The page returns with doubt upon his eyes, And brings a packet which his lord unties. “My lady wrote not, saw me not,” he said, “But sends that answer to the note instead.” “This string,” exclaims the knight,—“Cut it.” They lift A lid of pasteboard, and behold—a shift! CANTO II. “Now whether shame she means me, or my bliss,” The knight he cries, “thank her for this, for this!” And as he spoke, he smother'd up a kiss:— “To-morrow sees me panoplied indeed, And blessed be the thought shall clasp me while I bleed!” Next day the lists are set, the trumpets blown, And grace requested for a knight unknown. Who summons, and to mortal fight defies, Three lordly knights for most unlordly calumnies. What calumnies they are, he need not tell; Their names and consciences will serve as well. The names are then resounded through the place, And tow'rds the entrance turns the universal face. With scorn and rage the sturdy gallants hear, And ask what madman wants a sepulchre; But when the stranger, with his face unshown, Rides in, accoutred in a shift alone, (For on his trunk at least was naught beside) The doubtful laughter in amazement died. 'Twas clear the champion would be drench'd with wounds, Yet see how calm he rides the accustom'd rounds. His mould is manly as the lawn is frail, A shield is on his arm, his legs and thighs in mail;— The herald's laws forbid a wounded steed;— All strain their eyes, and on the shift they read, Written in black, and answering to the part The motto spoke of, “It has touch'd her heart.” To admiration deep th' amazement turns, The dumbness to discourse, which deeply burns; Till the four parties to their posts fall in, And soft eyes dazzle, ere the blows begin. No stint or measure in his gallantry The stranger knew; but took at once all three: The trumpets blew their blast of bloody weather, The swords are out, the warriors rush together, And with such bulk and tempest comes the knight, One of the three is overborne outright, Saddle and man, and snaps his wrist. The wretch Proclaims his rage and torture in a screech. The three had thought to save the shift, and bring The wearer down, for laughter to the king: But seeing what they see, and both on fire To reach him first, they turn and charge in ire, And mix the fight; and such a storm succeeds Of clatt'ring shields, and helms, and hurtling steeds, With such a toil pell-mell, now that, now this, Above, beneath, and rage of hit and miss, And horses half on ground, or staring high, And crouching skill, and trampling sov'reignty, That never was beheld a sight so fit To baffle and turn pale the gazer's wit. Nathless such skill the marv'llous knight display'd, The shift some time was spotless as the maid; Till a great gush proclaiming blood was drawn, Redder and redder grew the dainty lawn, And drench'd and dripping, not a thread there stood, But what was bath'd in his benignant blood. Sudden he turn'd; and whirling like a wheel, In both their teeth sent round the whistling steel; Then with a jovial wrist, he flash'd it down, And cleft the right man's shoulder to the bone; Who fell, and like the first was borne aside: “Is it a devil, or a saint?” they cried: A tenderer murmur midst the ladies ran: With tears they bless'd “the angel of a man.” The gallant lord was now the only foe, And fresh he seem'd: the knight could not be so; In that last blow his strength must have been summ'd; His arm appears unhing'd, his brain benumb'd; And as the sword seems carving him to death, At ev'ry gash the crowd draw in their breath. Sudden the blades are snapp'd; the clubs of steel Are call'd; the stranger is observ'd to reel; Then grasps with both his hands the saddle-bow, And bends for breath; the people cry “No! No!” And all the court unconsciously arise: The ladies on the king turn weeping eyes, And manly pray'rs are mix'd with sobs and cries. The monarch was about to part the fight, When, his club brought, sore passion seized the knight, Who grasp'd it, rais'd it like an iron frown, And rising in his stirrups, sent it down: It met the other's, taking heavier pains, And dash'd it, club and helmet, in his brains. A stifled shriek is heard, the victim falls, The victor too: “Help! Help!” the monarch calls; A shout, half terror, shakes the suburb walls. His helm unloos'd, they recognize the face Of the best knight that ever bore disgrace, Now seeming dead, and gone to his long rest In comfort cold of that hard-hearted vest. The loveliest ladies kiss him as he lay, Then watch the leech, who cuts his vest away, And clears his wounds. The weeping dames prepare Linen and balms, and part his forlorn hair, And let upon his face the blessed air. Meanwhile the tidings to his mistress come, Who clasps her hands and for a while is dumb; Then owns the secret why the shift was sent, But said he far exceeded what she meant. Pale and despairing to the spot she flies, Where in his death-like rest her lover lies, And prays to be let in:—they let her in: She sees his hands laid straight, and his pale chin, Nor dares advance to look upon his face, Till round her come the ladies in the place, Who comfort her, and say she must complete The cure, and set her in the nurse's seat. All day she watch'd, all night, and all next day, And scarcely turn'd her face, except to pray, Till the third morn; when, breathing with a moan, And feeling the soft hand that clasp'd his own, He woke, and saw the face that had not ceas'd To haunt his thoughts, in forest or at feast, Visibly present, sweet with begging fears, And eyes that lov'd him through remorseful tears. Ah! love is a soft thing; and strongest eyes Might answer, as his did, with wells of balmy rise. What need I say? a loitering cure is his, But full of sweets, and precious memories, And whispers, laden from the land of bliss. Sir Hugo with the lark has left his bed; 'Tis June; 'tis lover's month; in short, they wed. But how? like other people, you suppose, In silks and state, as all good story goes. The bridegroom did, and never look'd so well, Not e'en when in the shift he fought pell-mell; But the fair bride, instead of things that bless Wedding-day eyes, display'd a marvellous dress,— Marvellous, and homely, and in open sight; The people were so mov'd, they wept outright. For lo! with hair let loose about her ears, And taper in her hand the fair appears, And naked feet, a rosy saint at shrift, And round her bosom hangs the ruddy shift: Tatter'd it hangs, all cut and carv'd to rags; Not fairer droop, when the great organ drags Its thunders forth, a church's hundred flags. With glimmering tears she hastens to his feet, And kneels to kiss them in the public street, Then takes his hand, and ere she will arise, Entreats for pardon at his gracious eyes; And hopes he will not scorn her love for life, As his most humble and most honour'd wife. Awhile her lord, with manly deference stood Wrapt in the sweetness of that angel mood; Then stoop'd, and on her brow his soul impress'd, And at the altar thus the bride was dress'd. THE PALFREY. 1842. The following story is a variation of one of the most amusing of the old French narrative poems that preceded the time of Chaucer, with additions of the writer's invention. The original, which he did not see till it was completed, is to be found in the collection of Messrs. Barbazan and Méon, (Fabliaux et Contes des Poètes François des 11, 12, 13, 14, et 15? Siècles, &amp;c. Edition 1808.) His own originals were the prose abridgment of M. Le Grand (Fabliaux, &amp;c., third edition, volume the fourth,) and its imitation in verse by Messrs. Way and Ellis, inserted in the latter's notes to the select translations from Le Grand by the former of those gentlemen. The scene of the old story,—the only known production of a poet named Huon le Roi (possibly one of the “Kings of the Minstrels,” often spoken of at that period,)—is laid in the province of Champagne; but as almost all the narrative poems under the title of Lays (of which this is one) are with good reason supposed to have had their source in the Greater or Lesser Britain—that is to say, either among the Welsh of this island, or their cousins of French Brittany, and as the only other local allusions in the poem itself are to places in England, the author has availed himself of the common property in these effusions claimed for the Anglo-Norman Muse, “Begirt with British and Armorick knights,” to indulge in a license universal with the old minstrels, and lay the scene of his version where and when he pleased; to wit, during the reign of Edward the First, and in Kensington, Hendon, and their neighbourhoods,—old names, however new they sound. There is reason to believe, that the woody portions of Kensington, still existing as the Gardens, and in the neighbourhood of Holland House, are part of the ancient forest of Middlesex, which extended from this quarter to the skirts of Hertfordshire: and it is out of regard for these remnants of the old woods, and associations with them still more grateful, that he has placed the scene of his heroine's abode on the site of the existing palace, and the closing scene of the poem in the hall of the De Veres, Earls of Oxford, who are supposed to have had a mansion at that period in the grounds of the present Holland House, near the part called the Moats. PART FIRST. The palfrey goes, the palfrey goes, Merrily well the palfrey goes; He carrieth laughters, he carrieth woes, Yet merrily ever the palfrey goes. 'Tis June, and a bright sun burneth all, Sir William hath gallop'd from Hendon Hall To Kensington, where in a thick old wood (Now its fair Gardens) a mansion stood, Half like fortress, and half like farm, A house which had ceas'd to be threaten'd with harm. The gates frown'd still, for the dignity's sake, With porter, portcullis, and bit of a lake; But ivy caress'd their warm old ease, And the young rooks chuckled across the trees, And burning below went the golden bees. The spot was the same, where on a May morn The Rose that toppeth the world was born. Sir William hath gallop'd, and well was bent His palfrey to second a swift intent; And yet, having come, he delayeth his knock, E'en though a sweet maiden counteth the clock Till she meet his eye from behind the chair, Where sitteth Sir Guy with his old white hair. But the youth is not rich; and day by day Sir Guy groweth cold, and hath less to say, And daunteth his wit with haws and hums, Coughing with grandeur, and twirling his thumbs, Till visiting turneth to shame and gall, And Sir William must speak what endangereth all. Now for any deed else, in love or in war, Knight bolder was none than the knight De la Barre (So styled by the king, from a traitor tall, Whom he pitch'd over barriers, armour and all); Short distance made he betwixt point and hilt; He was not a man that at tourney and tilt Sat bowing to every fair friend he could spy, Or bearing his fame with a fine cold eye; A hundred sweet eyes might be watching his own; He thought but of two, and of steeds to be thrown; And the trumpets no sooner blew mights to mights, Than crash went his onset and down went knights. And thus in his love for sweet Anne de Paul, Though forc'd to some stealths, 'twas honest withal: He wooed, though the old man ever was by, With talk such as fixeth a maiden's eye, With lore and with legends, earnest of heart, And an art that applied them, sprung out of no art, Till stealth for his sake seem'd truth's own right, And at an old casement long clos'd, one night, Through boughs never dry, in a pathless nook, Love's breathless delight in his vows she took. Ah! never thenceforth, by sunniest brook, Did the glittering cherry-trees beat the look Of the poor-growing stems in the pathless nook. But, alas! to plead love unto loving eyes, And to beg for its leave of the worldly wise, All humility sweet on the one side lies, And all on the other that mortifies. Sir William hath swallow'd a sigh at last, Big as his heart, and the words have pass'd: “I love your daughter, Sir Guy,” quoth he, “And though I'm not rich, yet my race may be; A race with a scutcheon as old as the best, Though its wealth lies at Acre in holy rest. Mine uncle, your friend, so blithe and old, Hath nobody nigher to leave his gold: The king hath been pleas'd to promise my sword The picking of some great Frenchman's hoard; And sire, meantime, should not blush for wife; Soft as her hand should fare her life; My rents, though small, can support her state, And I'd fight for the rest till I made them great. Vouchsafe to endure that I seek her love: I know she resembles the blest above; Her face would paint sweeter a monarch's bower, Though glory and grace were in every flower: But angels on monarchs themselves look down, And love is to love both coffer and crown.” Sir William ended, he scarce knew why, (But 'twas pity of self, to move pity thereby,) With a sad, perchance with an abject sigh, And stoop'd and kiss'd the hand of Sir Guy: Steady and sharp was the old man's eye. “Sir William, no doubt, is a bold young knight,” Quoth he, “and my daughter a beauty bright; And a beauty bright and a bold young man Have suited, I wot, since the world began. But the man that is bold and hath money beside, Cometh best arm'd for a beauteous bride. The court will be riding this way next week, To honour the earl's fat chimney reek; And softly will many a bold bright eye Fall on the face no face comes nigh. You speak of mirth, and you speak of age, Not in a way very civil or sage. Your kinsman, the friend whom you call so old, But ten years less than myself hath told: And I count not this body so ancient still, As to warrant green years to talk of my will. Let him come if he please (I shall greet the friend) And show me which way his post-obits tend, And then we can parley of courtings best; Till when, I advise you to court his chest.” Sir William he boweth as low as before, And after him closeth the soft room door, And he moaneth a moan, and half staggereth he; He doubteth which way the stairs may be. But the lower his bow, and the deeper his moan, The redder the spot in his cheek hath grown, And he loatheth the kiss to the hard old hand. “May the devil,” thought he, “for his best new brand, Pluck it, and strike to his soul red-hot! Why scorn me, and mock me? and why, like a sot, Must I stoop to him, low as his own court-plot? Will any one tell us,—will Nature declare,— How father so foul can have daughter so fair? But her mother of angels dreamt in her sorrow, And hence came this face—this dimpled May-morrow.” And as he thought thus, from a door there stole A hand in a tremble, a balm to his soul; And soft though it trembled, it close wrung his, And with it a letter;—and gone it is. Sir William hath dash'd in the forest awhile, His being seems all a hasty smile: And there, by green light and the cooing of doves, He readeth the letter of her he loves, And kisseth and readeth again and again; His bridle is dropp'd on his palfrey's mane, Who turneth an ear, and then, wise beast, Croppeth the herbage,—a prudent feast: For Sir William no sooner hath read nine times, Than he deemeth delay the worst of crimes: He snatcheth the bridle, and shakes it hard, And is off for his life on the loud green sward; He foameth up steep, and he hisseth in stream, And saluteth his uncle like one in a dream. “Sir William, Sir William, what chase is this? Have you slain a fat buck, or stolen a kiss; And is all the world, on account of his wife, After poor dripping Sir William's life!” “Most honour'd of kinsmen,” Sir William cried, “Nought have I stolen, but hope of a bride; Her father, no Christian like her, but a Jew, Would make me disburse; which grieveth her too. You know who she is, but have yet to know, What a rose in the shade of that rock could grow; What fulness of beauty, on footstalk light; What a soul for sweet uncle to love at sight. Ah! Sir, she loveth your own blithe fame, And dareth, she saith, in your sister's name Entreat me the loan of some fields of corn, Which her dowry shall buy on the bridal morn. I blush, dear uncle; I drop mine eyelids; Yet who should blush when a lady bids? 'Tis lending me bliss; 'tis lending me life And she'll kiss you withal, saith the rosy wife.” “Ah, ha,” quoth Sir Grey, with his twinkling eyes: “The lass, I see, is both merry and wise; I call her to mem'ry, an earnest child, Now looking straight at you, now laughing wild: 'Tis now—let me see—five long years ago, And that's a good time for such buds to blow. Well, dry your outside, and moisten your in; This wine is a bud of my oldest bin; And we'll talk of the dowry, and talk of the day, And see if her bill be good, boy, eh?” Sir Grey didn't say, You're my sister's son, I have left you my gold, and your work is done,— He hated to speak of his gold, like death; And he lov'd a good bill as he lov'd his breath; And yet, for all that, Sir Grey, I trow, Was a very good man, as corn-dealers go. So the lover hath seiz'd the new old hand, And kiss'd it as though it had given the land, And invok'd on its bounty such bliss from above, Thought he, “Of a truth I am mean in love.” But free was his fervour from any such vice; For when obligation's more fitting than nice, We double the glow of our thanks and respect, To hide from th' obliger his own defect. “That palfrey of thine's a good palfrey, Will; He holdeth his head up, and danceth still, And trippeth as light by the ostler's side, As though just saddled to bear your bride; And yet, by Saint Richard, as drench'd is he And as froth'd as though just out of the sea: Methinks I hear him just landed free, Shaking him and his saddle right thunderously. And he starteth at nothing?” “No more than the wall.” “And is sure of his footing?” “As monarch in hall. He's a thunder in fight, and a thief on the road, So swiftly he speedeth whatever his load! Yet round the wolf's den half a day will he hover, And carrying a lady, takes heed like a lover.” “And therefore Sir William will part with him never?” “Nay, uncle, he will;—forever and ever.” “And what such a jewel may purchase, I pray?” “Thanks, thanks, dearest uncle, and not saying Nay. Now prythee deny me not grace so small: The palfrey in truth is comely withal, And you still shall lend him to bear my bride; But whom, save our help, should he carry beside?” “I'm vex'd.” “For pity.” “I'm griev'd.” “Now pray.” “'Tis cheap,” thought the uncle, “this not saying Nay.” PART SECOND. The palfrey goes, the palfrey goes, Merrily ever the palfrey goes; Nought he carrieth now but woes, And yet full well the palfrey goes. Sir Grey and Sir Guy, like proper old boys, Have met, with a world of coughing and noise; And after subsiding, judiciously dine, Serious the venison, and chirping the wine. They talk of the court, now gathering all To the sunny plump smoke of Earl-Mount Hall: And pity their elders laid up on the shelves, And abuse every soul upon earth but themselves: Only Sir Grey doth it rather to please, And Sir Guy out of honest old spite and disease: For Sir Guy hath a face so round and so red, The whole of his blood seemeth hanging his head, While Sir Grey's red face is waggish and thin, And he peereth with upraised nose and chin. Nathless Sir Grey excepteth from blame His nephew Sir Will, and his youthful fame; And each soundeth t'other, to learn what hold The youth and the lady may have of his gold. Alas! of his gold will neither speak, Tho' the wine it grew strong, and the tongue grew weak, And when the sweet maiden herself appears, With a breath in her bosom, and blush to her ears, And the large thankful eyes of the look of a bride, Sir Grey recollecteth no creature beside: He watcheth her in, he watcheth her out; He measureth her ankle, but not with his gout; He chucketh, like chanticleer over a corn, And thinks it but forty years since he was born. “Why, how now, Sir Grey? methinks you grow young: How soon are your own wedding bells to be rung? You stare on my daughter, like one elf-struck.” “Alas! and I am,—the sadder my luck:— Albeit, Sir Guy, your own shoulders count Years not many more than mine own amount, And I trust you don't feign to be too old to wed?” “Hoh! hoh!” quoth Sir Guy; “that was cunningly said.” (Yet he felt flatter'd too, did the white old head.) “What are years?” continued Sir Grey, looking bold; “There are men never young, and men never old. Old and young lips may carol in tune; Green laugheth the oak 'gainst the brown mid June. Lo! dapper Sir Kit, with his large young wife; His big-leggéd babes are the pride of his life.” Sir Guy shook his head. “And the stout old lord, Whose wife sitteth front him so meek at his board.” “Ay, ay,” quoth Sir Guy, “and stuffeth so fast, His eyesight not reaching the lady's repast.” “Well, well,” quoth Sir Grey— “Ill, ill,” quoth Sir Guy; “The children of old men full well I descry; They look, by Saint Christendom! old as themselves; Are dwarf'd, are half wither'd! they grin like elves.” “They may,” quoth Sir Grey, “when both parents are old, Or when the old parent is wrinkle-soul'd; But not when he's hearty and merry as we. You grieve me, Sir Guy. Oh! 'tis doleful to see How vainly a friend may come here for a bride, Though he loveth the daughter, and father beside.” “Your pardon, your pardon, dear friend,” crieth Guy: “What, you? What, Sir Grey with his ever-bright eye? We talk'd of the old, but who talk'd of Sir Grey? But speak ye right soberly? mean what ye say?” “Ay, truly I do,” with a sigh crieth Grey; “As truly as souls that for Paradise pray. And hark ye, dear friend; you'll miss your sweet Anne, If she weddeth, I wot, some giddy young man. He'll bear her away, and be lov'd alone, And wish, and yet grudge, your very tomb-stone. Now give her to me, I'll give her my gold, And I'll give to yourself my wood and my wold. And come and live here, and we'll house together, And laugh o'er our cups at the winter weather. “A bargain! a bargain!” cried old Sir Guy, With a stone at his heart, and the land in his eye; “Your hand to the bargain, my dear old friend: My ‘old’ did I call thee? My world without end. I'll bustle her straight; and to keep all close, You shall carry her with you, ere creature knows, Save Rob, and Sir Rafe, and a few beside, For guests and for guards to the travelling bride; And so, ere the chattering court come down, Wed her at home in your own snug town.” Now a murrain, I say, on those foul old men! I never, myself, shall see fifty again, And can pity a proper young-blooded old fellow, Whose heart is green, though his cheek be yellow; For Nature, albeit she never doth wrong, Yet seemeth in such to keep youth too long: And 'tis grievous when such an one seeth his bliss In a face which can see but the wrinkles in his. Ah! pray let him think there are dames not young, For whom the bells yet might be handsomely rung. 'Tis true, grey-beards have been, like Jove's of old, That have met a young lip, nor been thought too bold. In Norfolk a wondrous old lord hath been seen, Who at eighty was not more than forty, I ween; And I myself know a hale elderly man, In face and in frolic a very god Pan. But marvels like these are full rare, I wis: And when elders in general young ladies would kiss, I exhort the dear souls to fight and to flee, Unless they should chance to run against me. Alas! I delay as long as I can, For who may find words for thy grief, sweet Anne? 'Tis hard, when young heart, singing songs of to-morrow, Is suddenly met by the old hag, Sorrow. She fainteth, she prayeth, she feeleth sore ill; She wringeth her hands; she cannot stand still; She tasteth the madness of wonder and will;— Nor, sweet though she was, had she yielded at last, Had Sir Guy not his loathly old plethora cast In the scale against love and its life-long gains, And threaten'd her fears for his bursting veins. “I'll wed him,” she wrote to Sir William;—“yes; But nothing on earth—” and here her distress Broke off, and she wept, and the tears fell hot On the paper, and made a great starry blot. Alas! tears and letter burn under the eye Of watchful, unmerciful, old Sir Guy; And so on a night, when all things round, Save the trees and the moon, were sleeping sound, From his casement in shadow he sees his child, Bent in her weeping, yet alway mild, The fairest thing in the moon's fair ray, Borne like some bundle of theft away; Borne by a horde of old thieves away, The guests and the guards of false Sir Grey. She pray'd, but she spake out aloud no word; She wept, but no breath of self-pity was heard: Her woe was a sight for no dotards to see; And yet not bereft of all balm was she; One balm there was left her, one strange but rare, Nay, one in the shape of a very despair, To wit, the palfrey that wont to bear The knight De la Barre on his daily way To her, and love, and false Sir Grey. Him it had borne, her now it bore; And weeping sweet, though more and more, And praying for its master's bliss (Oh! no true love will scoff at this,) She stoop'd and gave its neck a kiss. PART THIRD. The palfrey goes, the palfrey goes, Merrily still the palfrey goes; He goes a path he never chose, Yet still full well the palfrey goes. Could the sweet moon laugh, its light Had surely been convuls'd that night, To see fifteen old horsemen wag Their beards, to one poor maiden's nag; Fifteen old beards in chat and cough, Rumbling to keep the robbers off, And ever and aye, when lanes grew close, Following each the other's nose, And with the silver beam she cast Tipp'd, like every tree they pass'd. The owls they seem'd to hoot their folly With a staring melancholy. After jealous sort, I wis, Cull'd Sir Grey these guests of his, Not a soul so young as he Gracing all his chivalry: Six there were of toothless fame, With each his man, of jaws as tame; Then his own, the palsiest there; And last, Sir Guy's, with whitest hair: And each had snugg'd him for the night In old flapp'd hat, and cap as white, In double cloak, and threefold hose, Besides good drink to warm his toes, And so they jog it, beard and nose, And in the midst the palfrey goes; Oh! ever well the palfrey goes; He knows within him what he knows, And so, full well the palfrey goes. But in his hamlet, hous'd apart, How far'd meantime, Sir William's heart? Oh, when the sun first went to bed, Not richer look'd the sun's own head, Nor cast a more all-gladdening eye: He seem'd to say, “My heav'n is nigh.” For he had heard of rare delights Between those two old feasting knights, And of a pillion, new and fair, Ordain'd to go some road as rare; With whom? For what sweet rider's art? Whose, but the dancer's at his heart, The light, the bright, yet balmy she, And who shall fetch her home but he? Who else be summon'd speedily By the kind uncle full of glee To fetch away that ecstasy? So, ever since that news, his ear, Listening with a lofty fear Lest it catch one sound too late, Stood open, like a palace gate That waits the bride of some great king, Heard with her trumpets travelling. At length a letter. Whose? Sir Guy's, The father's own. With reverent eyes, With heart impatient to give thanks, And tears that top their glimmering banks, He opens, reads, turns pale as death; His noble bosom gasps for breath; His Anne has left his love for gold, But in her kindness manifold Extorted from his uncle's hoard Enough to leave him bed and board. Ah! words like those were never Anne's; Too plainly they the coarse old man's; But still the letter; still the fact; With pangs on pangs his heart is rack'd. Love is an angel, has no pride; She'll mourn his love when he has died: Yet love is truth; so hates deceit; He'll pass and scorn her in the street. Now will he watch her house at night For glimpse of her by some brief light, Such as perhaps his own pale face May show: and then he'll quit the place. Now he will fly her, hate, detest, Mock: make a by-word and a jest: Then he hates hate; and who so low As strike a woman's fame! No, no; False love might spite the faithless Anne, But true was aye the gentleman. Thus paceth he, 'twixt calm and mad, Till the mid-watch, his chamber sad; And then lies down in his day-dress, And sleeps for very weariness, Catching and starting in his moan, And waking with a life-long groan. Sometimes he dreams his sorrow makes Such weeping wail, that, as he wakes, He lifts his pitying hand to try His cheek, and wonders it is dry. Sometimes his virgin bride and he Are hous'd for the first time, and free To dwell within each other's eyes; And then he wakes with woful cries. Sometimes he hears her call for aid; Sometimes beholds her bright arrayed, But pale, and with her eyes on earth; And once he saw her pass in mirth, And look at him, nor eye let fall, And that was wofull'st dream of all. At length he hears, or thinks he hears,— (Or dreams he still with waking ears?) A tinkle of the house's bell! What news can midnight have to tell? He listens. No. No sound again. The breeze hath stirr'd the window pane; Perchance it was the tinkling glass; Perchance 'twas his own brain, alas! His own weak brain, which hears the blood Pulse at his ears,—a tingling flood, Strange mantler in as strange a cup. Yet hark again!—he starts, leans up; It seems to fear to wake a mouse, That sound;—then peals, and wakes the house. But first, to end what I began, The journey of sweet houseless Anne. PART FOURTH. The palfrey goes, the palfrey goes, Merry and well the palfrey goes; You cannot guess till time disclose, How perfectly well the palfrey goes. Ah! dream Sir William what he might, Little he dreamt the truth that night. Could but some friend have told him all, How had he spurred from Hendon Hall, And dash'd among the doting set, Who bore away that soft cheek wet! How had the hills by which they go, Reëcho'd to his dire “Hallo!” Startling the waking farmers' ears With thoughts of thieves and murderers, And scattering wide those owlish men, While close he clasp'd his dove again. But where I left them, safe go they, Their drowsy noses droop'd alway To meet the beard's attractive nest, Push'd upwards from the muffled breast. Drowsy they nod, and safe they go; Sir Grey's good steeds the country know, And lead the rest full soft and well, Till snore on snore begins to swell, Warm as owl-plumage, toned as bell; True snores, composed of spices fine, Supper, fresh air, and old mull'd wine. At first they wake with start and fright, And sniff and stare with all their might, And sit, one moment, bolt upright: But soon reverts each nodding crown: It droops, it yields, it settles down; Till in one snore, sincere and deep, The whole grave train are fast asleep. Sir Grey, the youngest, yields the last: Besides he held two bridles fast, The lady's palfrey having shown Much wish to turn up lanes unknown. Even sweet Anne can war not long With sleep, the gentle and the strong; And as the fingers of Sir Grey By fine degrees give dulcet way, And leave the happy beast his will, The only creatures waking still And free to go where fancy leads, Are the twice eight bit-mumbling steeds. Some few accordingly turn round, Their happy memories homeward bound, And soon awake their jolted lords, Who bless themselves from bandit hordes, And thinking they have only lagg'd, Are willingly half jelly-bagg'd. The rest,—the palfrey meek as any,— Jog still onward with the many; Passing now by Kilburn rill, And now by Hampstead's leaf-stirr'd hill, Which lulls them still as they descend The sylvan trough of sweet North-end. And till they reach thy plot serene And bowery granges, Golders-green. Now Golders-green had then a road (The same as that just re-bestow'd) Which cross'd the main road, and went straight To Finchley, and Sir Grey's own gate; And thither (every sleeper still Depending on his horse's will,) Thither, like sheep, turns every head That follows where the sagest led,— All but the palfrey's. He, good beast, From his new master's clutch releas'd, And longing much his old to see, His stalls, and all his bounty free (For poor Sir William's household ways Were nobler than the rich Sir Grey's,) Goes neither to the right nor left, But straight as honesty from theft, Straight as the dainty to the tooth, Straight as his lady's love and truth, Straight for the point, the best of all, Sir William's arms and Hendon Hall. Not far from where we left them all, Those steeds and sires, was Hendon Hall, Some twice four hundred yards or so; And steeds to stables quickly go. The lady wakes with the first start; She cries aloud; she cowers at heart; And looks around her in affright On the wide, lonely, homeless night; Then checks, as sharply as she may (Not yet aware how blest his way,) Her eager friend; and nighly faints, And calls on fifty gentle saints, And, if she could, would close her eyes, For fear of thieves and sorceries, Of men all beard and blood, and calls Over lone fields, and lighted palls, And elves that ever, as you go, Skip at your side with mop and mow, With gibbering becks and moony stares, Forcing your eyes to look on theirs. And see! the moon forsakes the road; She lifts her light to whence it flow'd: Has she a good or ill bestow'd, That thus her light forsakes the road? The owls they hoot with gloomier cry; They seem to see a murder nigh: And how the palfrey snorts and pulls! Now Mary help poor wandering fools! The palfrey pulls, and he must go; The lady's hand may not say No, And go he does; the palfrey goes; He carrieth now no longer woes; For she, e'en she, now thinks she knows— Sweet Anne begins to think she knows Those gathering huts, those poplar rows, That water, falling as it flows, This bridge o'er which the palfrey goes, This gate, at which he stops, and shows His love to it with greeting nose. Ah! surely recollects she well All she has heard her lover tell Of this same gate, and that same bell: And she it was, you guess full well, That pull'd and pull'd again that bell; And down her love has come pell-mell With page, and squire, and all who ran, And was the first to find his Anne,— Was a most mad and blissful man, Clasping his fainting, faithful Anne. PART FIFTH. The palfrey goes, the palfrey goes; His work is done, you may suppose. No:—double burden now he knows, Yet well for ever the palfrey goes. The bells in many a giddy ring Run down the wind to greet the King, Who comes to feast for service done, With Earl De Vere at Kensington, And brings with him his constant grace Queen Eleanor, that angel's face. In many-footed order free First ride his guards, all staid to see; In midst of whom the trumpets blow, Straight as power and glory go; And then his lords and knights, each one A manly splendour in the sun; And then his lofty self appears, Calmer for the shouts he hears, With his Queen the courteous-eyed, Like strength and sweetness side by side; And thus, his banner steering all, Rides the King to Earl-Mount Hall. Meantime, ere yet the sovereign pair Were threading London's closer air, An humbler twain, heart link'd as they, Were hearing larks and scenting hay, And coming too, to Earl-Mount Hall Through many a green lane's briery wall, Many a brier and many a rose, And merrily ever the palfrey goes, Merrily though he carrieth two, And one hath sometimes great ado To sit while o'er the ruts he goes, Nor clasp the other doubly close, Who cannot choose but turn, and then— Why, if none see, he clasps again. “Ah,” thinks the lady, as she looks Through tears and smiles with half-rebukes, “Ah, must my father break his heart? For surely now we never part.” Behind, some furlong off, and 'twixt Those winding oaks with poplars mix'd, Come two upon a second steed, Male, too, and female; not indeed The female young and fair as t' other: She is the page's honour'd mother. Much talk they on the road;—at least Much talks the mother; while the beast Pulls at the hedges as he goes, Pricking oft his tossing nose; And the page, though listening, sees Newts in the brooks and nests in trees. Lastly a hound, tongue-lolling, courses To and fro 'twixt both the horses, Giving now some weasel chase, And loving now his master's face, And so with many a turn and run Goes twenty furlongs to their one. This riding double was no crime In the first great Edward's time; No brave man thought himself disgrac'd By two fair arms about his waist; Nor did the lady blush vermilion, Dancing on the lover's pillion. Why? Because all modes and actions Bow'd not then to Vulgar Fractions; Nor were tested all resources By the power to purchase horses. Many a steed yet won had he, Our lover, in his chivalry; For, in sooth, full half his rents Were ransoms gain'd in tournaments; But all, save these, were gone at present.— Ah! the green lane still was pleasant. Hope was theirs. For one sweet hour Did they, last night, in bliss devour Each other's questions, answers, eyes, Nor ever for divine surprise Could take a proper breath, much less The supper brought in hastiness By the glad little gaping page; While rose meantime his mother sage To wait upon the lady sweet, And snore discreetly on the seat In the oriel of the room, Whence gleam'd her night-cap through the gloom. Then parted they to lie awake For transport, spite of all heart-ache: For heaven's in any roof that covers, Any one same night, two lovers; They may be divided still; They may want, in all but will; But they know that each is there, Each just parted, each in prayer; Each more close, because apart, And every thought clasp'd heart to heart. Alas! in vain their hearts agree: Good must seem good, as well as be; And lest a spot should stain his flower For blushing in a brideless bower, Sir William with the lark must rise, And bear,—but whither bear?—his prize: Not to Sir Grey's, for that were scorn; Not to Sir Guy's, to live forlorn; Not to some abbey's jealous care, For Heaven would try to wed her there; But to a dame that serv'd the Queen, His aunt, and no mean dame I ween,— A dame of rank, a dame of honour, A dame (may earth lie green upon her!) That felt for nature, love, and truth, And hated old age pawing youth: One that at no time held wrong right, Yet somehow took a dear delight, By secret measures, sweet and strong, In giving right a zest of wrong. To her Sir William brings his Anne Three hours before the feast began, But first has sent his page to spy How day has dawn'd with old Sir Guy. The page scarce vanish'd, reappears, His eyes wide open as their ears, And tells how all the beards are there: All;—every mump of quivering hair, Come back with groan, and back with stare, To set Sir Guy upon the rack, And find the lady not come back. “Now God bless all their groans and stares, And eke their most irreverend hairs!” Cries the good dame, the Lady Maud, Laughing with all her shoulders broad:— “My budget bursteth sure with this! This were a crowning galliardise For king himself to tell in hall, Against his lords' wit groweth small.” And rustling in her vestments broad, Forth sails the laughing Lady Maud To tell the King and tell the Queen; But first she kiss'd sweet Anne between The sighing lips and downcast eyes, And said, “Old breaking hearts are lies.” Three hours have come, three hours have gone; King Edward, with his crownet on, Sits highest where the feast is set; With wine the sweetest lips are wet; The music makes a heaven above, And underneath is talk of love. The King look'd out from where he sat, And cried “Sir Guy de Paul!” Thereat The music stopp'd with awe and wonder, Like discourse when speaks the thunder; And the feasters, one and all, Gazed upon Sir Guy de Paul. “How chanceth it, Sir Guy de Paul, Your daughter graceth not the call To the feast at Earl-Mount Hall? My friends here boast her like the Queen: What maketh such a face unseen?” “Sir,” quoth Sir Guy, “a loyal breast Hath brought a man here sore distress'd. My daughter, through device, 'tis fear'd, Of some false knight, hath disappear'd.” “Hah!” quoth the King, “since when, I pray? They tell me 'twas but yesterday That she was mark'd, for two long hours, Praying behind her window-flowers.” “Alas! sir, 'twas at night.—Forgive My failing speech. I scarcely live Till I have sought her high and low, And know, what then the King shall know.” “Now God confound all snares, and bring Base hearts to sorrow!” cried the King; “Myself will aid thee, and full soon. Ho! master bard, good Rafe de Boon, Pinch thy fair harp, and make it tell Of those old thieves who slept so well.” The minstrel bowed with blushing glee; His harp into his arms took he, And rous'd its pulses to a mood Befitting love and hardihood. Then, with his ready wit sincere, He sang to every tingling ear, How fifteen brave old beards, one night, Bore off one lady in a fright; With what amazing knees they kept Their saddles, and how fiercely slept; And how a certain palfrey chose To leave them to their proud repose, And through the wildering night-time bear The lady to her lover's care. He nam'd no names, he drew no face, Yet not a soul mistook the case; Till by degrees, boards, tap'stries, rafters, Echoed the King's and feasters' laughters; And once again, all Earl-Mount Hall Gazed upon Sir Guy de Paul. But how the laughter raged and scream'd, When lo! these fifteen beards all stream'd In at the great door of the hall! Those very grey-beards, one and all, By the King's command in thrall, All mounted and all scar'd withal, And scarlet as Sir Guy de Paul! By heavens! 'twas “merry in the hall,” When every beard but those “wagg'd all.” Out spoke the King with wrathful breath, Smiting the noise as still as death: “Are these the suitors to destroy My projects with new tales of Troy? These the bold knights and generous lords To wed our heiresses and wards? Now, too, while Frenchman and while Scot Have cost us double swords, God wot! Are these replenishers of nations? Begetters of great generations? Out with them all! and bring to light A fitter and a fairer sight.” Queen Eleanor glanc'd down the hall, She pitied old Sir Guy de Paul, Who, while these doters went their way, Knew neither how to go nor stay, But sate bent close, his shame to smother, Rubbing one hand upon the other. A page she sent him, bright and mild, Who led him forth, like his own child. Out went the beards by a side door; The great one roll'd apart once more, And, as the King had given command, In rode a couple, hand in hand, Who made the stillness stiller:—he A man to grace all jeopardy; And all a lovely comfort, she. The stalwart youth bestrode a steed, A Barbary, the King's own breed; The lady grac'd her palfrey still, Sweet beast, that ever hath his will, And paceth now beside his lord, Straight for the King at the high board, Till sharp the riders halt, and wait The speaking of the crowned state,— The knight with reverential eyes, Whose grateful hope no claim implies: The lady in a bashful glow, Her bosom billowing to and fro. “Welcome! Sir William de la Barre,” The monarch cried; “a right good star For ladies' palfreys led astray; And welcome his fair flower of May. By heavens! I will not have my knights Defrauded of their lady rights. I give thee, William de la Barre, For this thy bride, and that thy scar Won from the big-limb'd traitor Pole, The day thou dash'dst out half his soul And lett'st his ransom free, for ruth (For which thou wert a foolish youth,) All those good meadows, lately his, Down by the Brent, where thy hall is, And all thy rights in that same hall, Together with the osieries all That skirt the streams by down and dale, From Hendon into Perivale. And now dismount. And hark ye, there, Sir Priest, my chaplain Christopher, (See how the honest body dries The tears of claret in his eyes!)— Come and betroth these friends of mine, Till at the good Earl's chapel shrine Thy holy magic make them one: The King and Queen will see it done. But first a royal health to all The friends we leave in this fair hall; And may all knights' and ladies' horses Take, like the palfrey, vigorous courses!” With princely laughter rose the King, Rose all, the laughter echoing, Rose the proud wassail, rose the shout By the trumpets long stretch'd out; You would have thought that roof and all Rose in that heart-lifted hall. On their knees are two alone; The palfrey and the barb have gone: And then arose those two beside, And the music from its pride Falls into a beauteous prayer, Like an angel quitting air; And the King and his soft Queen Smile upon those two serene, Whom the priest, accosting bland, Puts, full willing, hand in hand. Ah scarcely even King and Queen Did they then perceive, I ween, Nor well to after-memory call, How they went from out that hall. What more? Sir Guy, and then Sir Grey, Died each upon a fine spring day; And, in their hatred of things small, Left him, now wanting nothing, all: (All which, at least, that mighty claw Permitted them, yclept the law.) The daughter wept, and wept the more To think her tears would soon be o'er; Sir William neither wept nor smil'd, But grac'd the father for the child, And sent, to join the funeral shows, Bearing scutcheons, bearing woes, The palfrey; and full well he goes; Oh! merrily well the palfrey goes; Grief great as any there he knows, Yet merrily ever the palfrey goes. L'ENVOY. To her, who loves all peaceful glory, Therefore laurell'd song and story; Who, as blooming maiden should, Married blest, with young and good; And whose zeal for healthy duties Set on horseback half our beauties; Hie thee, little book, and say— (Blushing for leave unbegg'd alway; And yet how beg it for one flower Cast in the path of Sovereign Power?) Say that thy verse, though small it be, Yet mov'd by ancient minstrelsy To sing of youth escap'd from age, Scenes pleasant, and a Palfrey sage, And meditated, morn by morn, Among the trees where she was born, Dares come, on grateful memory's part, Not to Crown'd Head, but to Crown'd Heart. THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS. King Francis was a hearty king, and lov'd a royal sport, And one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court; The nobles filled the benches, with the ladies in their pride, And 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sigh'd: And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show, Valour and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below. Ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws; They bit, they glar'd, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws; With wallowing might and stifled roar they roll'd on one another, Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother; The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air; Said Francis then, “Faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there.” De Lorge's love o'erheard the King, a beauteous lively dame With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seem'd the same; She thought, the Count my lover is brave as brave can be; He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me; King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine; I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine. She dropp'd her glove, to prove his love, then look'd at him and smiled; He bow'd, and in a moment leap'd among the lions wild: The leap was quick, return was quick, he has regain'd his place, Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face. “By Heav'n!” said Francis, “rightly done!” and he rose from where he sat: “No love,” quoth he, “but vanity, sets love a task like that.” GODIVA. INSCRIBED TO JOHN HUNTER. John Hunter, friend of Leigh Hunt's verse, and lover of all duty, Hear how the boldest naked deed was clothed in saintliest beauty. Earl Lefric by his hasty oath must solemnly abide; He thought to put a hopeless bar, and finds it turn'd aside; His lady to remove the toll that makes the land forlorn, Will surely ride through Coventry, naked as she was born; She said—the people will be kind; they love a gentle deed; They piously will turn from me, nor shame a friend in need. Earl Lefric, half in holy dread, and half in loving care, Hath bade the people all keep close in penitence and prayer; The windows are fast boarded up; nor hath a sound been heard Since yester-eve, save household dog, or latest summer-bird; Only Saint Mary's bell begins at intervals to go, Which is to last till all be past, to let obedience know. The mass is said; the priest hath bless'd the lady's pious will; Then down the stairs she comes undress'd, but in a mantle still; Her ladies are about her close, like mist about a star; She speaks some little cheerful words, but knows not what they are; The door is pass'd; the saddle press'd; her body feels the air; Then down they let, from out its net, her locks of piteous hair. Oh, then how every list'ner feels, the palfrey's foot that hears! The rudest are awed suddenly, the soft and brave in tears; The poorest that were most in need of what the lady did, Deem her a blessed creature born to rescue men forbid: He that had said they could have died for her beloved sake, Had rated low the thanks of woe. Death frights not old Heart-ache. Sweet saint! No shameless brow was hers, who could not bear to see, For thinking of her happier lot, the pine of poverty: No unaccustom'd deed she did, in scorn of custom's self, She that but wish'd the daily bread upon the poor man's shelf. Naked she went, to clothe the naked. New she was, and bold, Only because she held the laws which Mercy preach'd of old. They say she blush'd to be beheld, e'en of her ladies' eyes; Then took her way with downward look, and brief, bewilder'd sighs. A downward look; a beating heart; a sense of the new, vast, Wide, open, naked world, and yet of every door she pass'd; A pray'r, a tear, a constant mind, a listening ear that glow'd, These we may dare to fancy there, on that religious road. But who shall blind his heart with more? Who dare, with lavish guess, Refuse the grace she hoped of us, in her divine distress? In fancy still she holds her way, forever pacing on, The sight unseen, the guiltless Eve, the shame unbreath'd upon; The step, that upon Duty's ear is growing more and more, Though yet, alas! it hath to pass by many a scorner's door. CAPTAIN SWORD AND CAPTAIN PEN. I. HOW CAPTAIN SWORD MARCHED TO WAR. Captain Sword got up one day, Over the hills to march away, Over the hills and through the towns; They heard him coming across the downs, Stepping in music and thunder sweet, Which his drums sent before him into the street, And lo! 'twas a beautiful sight in the sun; For first came his foot, all marching like one, With tranquil faces, and bristling steel, And the flag full of honour as though it could feel, And the officers gentle, the sword that hold 'Gainst the shoulder heavy with trembling gold, And the massy tread, that in passing is heard, Though the drums and the music say never a word. And then came his horse, a clustering sound, Of shapely potency, forward bound, Glossy black steeds, and riders tall, Rank after rank, each looking like all, Midst moving repose and a threatening charm, With mortal sharpness at each right arm, And hues that painters and ladies love, And ever the small flag blush'd above. And ever and anon the kettle drums beat Hasty power midst order meet; And ever and anon the drums and fifes Came like motion's voice, and life's; Or into the golden grandeurs fell Of deeper instruments, mingling well, Burdens of beauty for winds to bear; And the cymbals kiss'd in the shining air, And the trumpets their visible voices rear'd, Each looking forth with its tapestried beard, Bidding the heavens and earth make way For Captain Sword and his battle-array. He, nevertheless, rode indifferent-eyed, As if pomp were a toy to his manly pride, Whilst the ladies loved him the more for his scorn, And thought him the noblest man ever was born, And tears came into the bravest eyes, And hearts swell'd after him double their size, And all that was weak, and all that was strong, Seem'd to think wrong's self in him could not be wrong, Such love, though with bosom about to be gored, Did sympathy get for brave Captain Sword. So, half that night, as he stopp'd in the town, 'Twas all one dance going merrily down, With lights in windows and love in eyes, And a constant feeling of sweet surprise; But all the next morning 'twas tears and sighs; For the sound of his drums grew less and less, Walking like carelessness off from distress; And Captain Sword went whistling gay, “Over the hills and far away.” II. HOW CAPTAIN SWORD WON A GREAT VICTORY. Through fair and through foul went Captain Sword, Pacer of highway and piercer of ford, Steady of face in rain or sun, He and his merry men, all as one; Till they came to a place, where in battle-array Stood thousands of faces firm as they, Waiting to see which could best maintain Bloody argument, lords of pain; And down the throats of their fellow-men Thrust the draught never drunk again. It was a spot of rural peace, Ripening with the year's increase, And singing in the sun with birds, Like a maiden with happy words— With happy words which she scarcely hears In her own contented ears, Such abundance feeleth she Of all comfort carelessly, Throwing round her, as she goes, Sweet half thoughts on lily and rose, Nor guesseth what will soon arouse All ears—that murder's in the house; And that, in some strange wrong of brain, Her father hath her mother slain. Steady! steady! The masses of men Wheel, and fall in, and wheel again, Softly as circles drawn with pen. Then a gaze there was, and valour, and fear, And the jest that died in the jester's ear, And preparation, noble to see, Of all-accepting mortality; Tranquil Necessity gracing Force; And the trumpets danced with the stirring horse; And lordly voices, here and there, Call'd to war through the gentle air; When suddenly, with its voice of doom Spoke the cannon 'twixt glare and gloom, Making wider the dreadful room: On the faces of nations round Fell the shadow of that sound. Death for death! The storm begins; Rush the drums in a torrent of dins; Crash the muskets, gash the swords; Shoes grow red in a thousand fords; Now for the flint, and the cartridge bite; Darkly gathers the breath of the fight, Salt to the palate, and stinging to sight, Muskets are pointed they scarce know where; No matter: Murder is cluttering there. Reel the hollows: close up! close up! Death feeds thick, and his food is his cup. Down go bodies, snap burst eyes; Trod on the ground are tender cries; Brains are dash'd against plashing ears; Hah! no time has battle for tears; Cursing helps better—cursing, that goes Slipping through friends' blood, athirst for foes'. What have soldiers with tears to do?— We, who this mad-house must now go through, This twenty-fold Bedlam, let loose with knives— To murder, and stab, and grow liquid with lives— Gasping, staring, treading red mud, Till the drunkenness' self makes us steady of blood? [Oh! shrink not thou, reader! Thy part's in it, too; Has not thy praise made the thing they go through, Shocking to read of, but noble to do?] No time to be “breather of thoughtful breath” Has the giver and taker of dreadful death. See where comes the horse-tempest again, Visible earthquake, bloody of mane! Part are upon us, with edges of pain; Part burst, riderless, over the plain, Crashing their spurs, and twice slaying the slain. See, by the living God! see those foot Charging down hill—hot, hurried, and mute! They loll their tongues out! Ah-hah! pell-mell! Horses roll in a human hell; Horse and man they climb one another— Which is the beast, and which is the brother? Mangling, stifling, stopping shrieks With the tread of torn-out cheeks, Drinking each other's bloody breath— Here's the fleshliest feast of Death. An odour, as of a slaughter-house, The distant raven's dark eye bows. Victory! victory! Man flies man; Cannibal patience hath done what it can— Carved, and been carved, drunk the drinkers down, And now there is one that hath won the crown;— One pale visage stands lord of the board— Joy to the trumpets of Captain Sword! His trumpets blow strength, his trumpets neigh, They and his horse, and waft him away; They and his foot, with a tired proud flow, Tatter'd escapers and givers of woe. Open, ye cities! Hats off! hold breath! To see the man who has been with Death; To see the man who determineth right By the virtue-perplexing virtue of might. Sudden before him have ceased the drums, And lo! in the air of empire he comes. All things present, in earth and sky, Seem to look at his looking eye. III. OF THE BALL THAT WAS GIVEN TO CAPTAIN SWORD. But Captain Sword was a man among men, And he hath become their playmate again: Boot, nor sword, nor stern look hath he, But holdeth the hand of a fair ladye, And floweth the dance a palace within, Half the night, to a golden din, Midst lights in windows and love in eyes, And a constant feeling of sweet surprise; And ever the look of Captain Sword Is the look that's thank'd, and the look that's adored. There was the country-dance, small of taste; And the waltz, that loveth the lady's waist; And the galopade, strange agreeable tramp, Made of a scrape, a hobble, and stamp; And the high-stepping minuet, face to face, Mutual worship of conscious grace; And all the shapes in which beauty goes Weaving motion with blithe repose. And then a table a feast display'd, Like a garden of light without a shade, All of gold, and flowers, and sweets, With wines of old church-lands, and sylvan meats, Food that maketh the blood feel choice; Yet all the face of the feast, and the voice, And heart, still turn'd to the head of the board; For ever the look of Captain Sword Is the look that's thank'd, and the look that's adored. Well content was Captain Sword; At his feet all wealth was pour'd; On his head all glory set; For his ease all comfort met; And around him seem'd entwined All the arms of womankind. And when he had taken his fill Thus, of all that pampereth will, In his down he sunk to rest Clasp'd in dreams of all its best. IV. ON WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE THE NIGHT AFTER THE VICTORY. 'Tis a wild night out of doors; The wind is mad upon the moors, And comes into the rocking town, Stabbing all things, up and down, And then there is a weeping rain Huddling 'gainst the window-pane, And good men bless themselves in bed; The mother brings her infant's head Closer, with a joy like tears, And thinks of angels in her prayers; Then sleeps, with his small hand in hers. Two loving women, lingering yet Ere the fire is out, are met, Talking sweetly, time-beguiled, One of her bridegroom, one her child, The bridegroom he. They have received Happy letters, more believed For public news, and feel the bliss The heavenlier on a night like this. They think him housed, they think him blest, Curtain'd in the core of rest, Danger distant, all good near; Why hath their “Good night” a tear? Behold him! By a ditch he lies Clutching the wet earth, his eyes Beginning to be mad. In vain His tongue still thirsts to lick the rain, That mock'd but now his homeward tears; And ever and anon he rears His legs and knees with all their strength, And then as strongly thrusts at length. Raised, or stretch'd, he cannot bear The wound that girds him, weltering there: And “Water!” he cries, with moonward stare. [“I will not read it!” with a start, Burning cries some honest heart; “I will not read it! Why endure Pangs which horror cannot cure? Why—Oh why? and rob the brave, And the bereaved, of all they crave, A little hope to gild the grave?” Ask'st thou why, thou honest heart? 'Tis because thou dost ask, and because thou dost start. 'Tis because thine own praise and fond outward thought Have aided the shows which this sorrow has wrought.] A wound unutterable—O God! Mingles his being with the sod. [“I'll read no more.”—Thou must, thou must: In thine own pang doth wisdom trust.] His nails are in earth, his eyes in air, And “Water!” he crieth—he may not forbear. Brave and good was he, yet now he dreams The moon looks cruel; and he blasphemes. [“No more! no more!” Nay, this is but one; Were the whole tale told, it would not be done From wonderful setting to rising sun. But God's good time is at hand—be calm, Thou reader! and steep thee in all thy balm Of tears or patience, of thought or good will, For the field—the field awaiteth us still.] “Water! water!” all over the field: To nothing but Death will that wound-voice yield. One, as he crieth, is sitting half bent; What holds he so close?—his body is rent. Another is mouthless, with eyes on cheek; Unto the raven he may not speak. One would fain kill him; and one half round The place where he writhes, hath up-beaten the ground. Like a mad horse hath he beaten the ground, And the feathers and music that litter it round, The gore, and the mud, and the golden sound. Come hither, ye cities! ye ball-rooms, take breath! See what a floor hath the Dance of Death! The floor is alive, though the lights are out; What are those dark shapes, flitting about? Flitting about, yet no ravens they, Not foes, yet not friends,—mute creatures of prey; Their prey is lucre, their claws a knife, Some say they take the beseeching life. Horrible pity is theirs for despair, And they the love-sacred limbs leave bare. Love will come to-morrow, and sadness, Patient for the fear of madness, And shut its eyes for cruelty, So many pale beds to see. Turn away, thou Love, nor weep More in covering his last sleep; Thou hast him:—blessed is thine eye! Friendless Famine has yet to die. A shriek!—Great God! what superhuman Peal was that? Not man, nor woman, Nor twenty madmen, crush'd, could wreak Their soul in such a ponderous shriek. Dumbly, for an instant, stares The field; and creep men's dying hairs. O friend of man! O noble creature! Patient and brave, and mild by nature, Mild by nature, and mute as mild, Why brings he to these passes wild, Thee, gentle horse, thou shape of beauty? Could he not do his dreadful duty, (If duty it be, which seems mad folly) Nor link thee to his melancholy? Two noble steeds lay side by side, One cropp'd the meek grass ere it died; Pang-struck it struck t'other, already torn, And out of its bowels that shriek was born. Now see what crawleth, well as it may, Out of the ditch, and looketh that way. What horror all black, in the sick moonlight, Kneeling, half human, a burthensome sight; Loathly and liquid, as fly from a dish; Speak, Horror! thou, for it withereth flesh. “The grass caught fire; the wounded were by; Writhing till eve did a remnant lie; Then feebly this coal abateth his cry; But he hopeth! he hopeth! joy lighteth his eye, For gold he possesseth, and Murder is nigh!” O goodness in horror! O ill not all ill! In the worst of the worst may be fierce Hope still. To-morrow with dawn will come many a wain, And bear away loads of human pain, Piles of pale beds for the 'spitals; but some Again will awake in home-mornings, and some, Dull herds of the war, again follow the drum. From others, faint blood shall in families flow, With wonder at life, and young oldness in woe, Yet hence may the movers of great earth grow. Now, even now, I hear them at hand, Though again Captain Sword is up in the land, Marching anew for more fields like these In the health of his flag in the morning breeze. Sneereth the trumpet, and stampeth the drum, And again Captain Sword in his pride doth come; He passeth the fields where his friends lie lorn, Feeding the flowers and the feeding corn, Where under the sunshine cold they lie, And he hasteth a tear from his old gray eye. Small thinking is his but of work to be done, And onward he marcheth, using the sun: He slayeth, he wasteth, he spouteth his fires On babes at the bosom, and bed-rid sires; He bursteth pale cities, through smoke and through yell, And bringeth behind him, hot-blooded, his hell. Then the weak door is barr'd and the soul all sore And hand-wringing helplessness paceth the floor, And the lover is slain, and the parents are nigh— Oh God! let me breathe, and look up at thy sky! Good is as hundreds, evil as one; Round about goeth the golden sun. V. HOW CAPTAIN SWORD, IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS GREAT VICTORIES, BECAME INFIRM IN HIS WITS. But to win at the game, whose moves are death, It maketh a man draw too proud a breath: And to see his force taken for reason and right, It tendeth to unsettle his reason quite. Never did chief of the line of Sword Keep his wits whole at that drunken board. He taketh the size, and the roar, and fate, Of the field of his action, for soul as great: He smiteth and stunneth the cheek of mankind, And saith, “Lo! I rule both body and mind.” Captain Sword forgot his own soul, Which of aught save itself resented control; Which whatever his deeds, ordained them still, Bodiless monarch, enthroned in his will: He forgot the close thought, and the burning heart, And pray'rs, and the mild moon hanging apart, Which lifted the seas with her gentle looks, And growth, and death, and immortal books, And the Infinite Mildness, the soul of souls, Which layeth earth soft 'twixt her silver poles; Which ruleth the stars, and saith not a word; Whose speed in the hair of no comet is heard; Which sendeth the soft sun, day by day, Mighty and genial, and just alway, Owning no difference, doing no wrong, Loving the orbs and the least bird's song, The great, sweet, warm angel, with golden rod, Bright with the smile of the distance of God. Captain Sword, like a witless thing, Of all under heaven must needs be a king, King of kings, and lord of lords, Swayer of souls as well as of swords, Ruler of speech, and through speech, of thought And hence to his brain was a madness brought. He madden'd in East, he madden'd in West, Fiercer for sights of men's unrest, Fiercer for talk, amongst awful men, Of their new mighty leader, Captain Pen, A conqueror strange, who sat in his home Like the wizard that plagued the ships of Rome, Noiseless, showless, dealing no death, But victories, winged, went forth from his breath. Three thousand miles across the waves Did Captain Sword cry, bidding souls be slaves: Three thousand miles did the echo return With a laugh and a blow made his old cheeks burn. Then he call'd to a wrong-madden'd people, and swore Their name in the map should never be more: Dire came the laugh, and smote worse than before. Were earthquake a giant, up-thrusting his head And o'erlooking the nations, not worse were the dread. Then, lo! was a wonder, and sadness to see; For with that very people, their leader, stood he, Incarnate afresh, like a Cæsar of old; But because he look'd back, and his heart was cold, Time, hope, and himself for a tale he sold. Oh largest occasion, by man ever lost! Oh throne of the world to the war-dogs tost! He vanish'd; and thinly there stood in his place The new shape of Sword, with an humbler face, Rebuking his brother, and preaching for right, Yet ay when it came, standing proud on his might, And squaring its claims with his old small sight; Then struck up his drums, with ensign furl'd, And said, “I will walk through a subject world: Earth, just as it is, shall for ever endure, The rich be too rich, and the poor too poor; And for this I'll stop knowledge. I'll say to it, ‘Flow Thus far: but presume no farther to flow: For me, as I list, shall the free airs blow.’” Laugh'd after him loudly that land so fair, “The king thou sett'st over us, by a free air Is swept away, senseless.” And old Sword then First knew the might of great Captain Pen. So strangely it bow'd him, so wilder'd his brain, That now he stood, hatless, renouncing his reign; Now mutter'd of dust laid in blood; and now 'Twixt wonder and patience went lifting his brow. Then suddenly came he with gowned men, And said, “Now observe me—I'm Captain Pen: I'll lead all your changes—I'll write all your books— I'm everything—all things—I'm clergymen, cooks, Clerks, carpenters, hosiers,—I'm Pitt—I'm Lord Grey.” 'Twas painful to see his extravagant way; But heart ne'er so bold, and hand ne'er so strong, What are they, when truth and the wits go wrong? VI. OF CAPTAIN PEN, AND HOW HE FOUGHT WITH CAPTAIN SWORD. Now tidings of Captain Sword and his state Were brought to the ears of Pen the Great, Who rose and said, “His time is come.” And he sent him, but not by sound of drum, Nor trumpet, nor other hasty breath, Hot with questions of life and death, But only a letter calm and mild; And Captain Sword he read it, and smiled, And said, half in scorn, and nothing in fear, (Though his wits seem'd restor'd by a danger near, For brave was he ever), “Let Captain Pen, Bring at his back a million men, And I'll talk with his wisdom, and not till then.” Then replied to his messenger Captain Pen, “I'll bring at my back a world of men.” Out laugh'd the captains of Captain Sword, But their chief look'd vex'd, and said not a word, For thought and trouble had touch'd his ears Beyond the bullet-like sense of theirs, And wherever he went, he was 'ware of a sound Now heard in the distance, now gathering round, Which irk'd him to know what the issue might be; But the soul of the cause of it well guess'd he. Indestructible souls among men Were the souls of the line of Captain Pen; Sages, patriots, martyrs mild, Going to the stake, as child Goeth with his prayer to bed; Dungeon-beams, from quenchless head; Poets, making earth aware Of its wealth in good and fair; And the benders to their intent, Of metal and of element; Of flame the enlightener, beauteous, And steam, that bursteth his iron house; And adamantine giants blind, That, without master, have no mind. Heir to these, and all their store, Was Pen, the power unknown of yore; And as their might still created might, And each work'd for him by day and by night, In wealth and wondrous means he grew, Fit to move the earth anew; Till his fame began to speak Pause, as when the thunders wake, Muttering in the beds of heaven: Then, to set the globe more even, Water he call'd, and Fire, and Haste, Which hath left old Time displaced— And Iron, mightiest now for Pen, Each of his steps like an army of men— (Sword little knew what was leaving him then) And out of the witchcraft of their skill, A creature he call'd to wait on his will— Half iron, half vapour, a dread to behold— Which evermore panted and evermore roll'd, And uttered his words a million fold. Forth sprang they in air, down raining like dew, And men fed upon them, and mighty they grew. Ears giddy with custom that sound might not hear, But it woke up the rest, like an earthquake near; And that same night of the letter, some strange Compulsion of soul brought a sense of change; And at midnight the sound grew into a roll As the sound of all gath'rings from pole to pole, From pole unto pole, and from clime to clime, Like the roll of the wheels of the coming of time;— A sound as of cities, and sound as of swords Sharpening, and solemn and terrible words, And laughter as solemn, and thunderous drumming, A tread as if all the world were coming. And then was a lull, and soft voices sweet Call'd into music those terrible feet, Which rising on wings, lo! the earth went round To the burn of their speed with a golden sound; With a golden sound, and a swift repose, Such as the blood in the young heart knows; Such as Love knows, when his tumults cease; When all is quick, and yet all is at peace. And when Captain Sword got up next morn, Lo! a new-faced world was born; For not an anger nor pride would it show, Nor aught of the loftiness now found low, Nor would his own men strike a single blow: Not a blow for their old, unconsidering lord Would strike the good soldiers of Captain Sword; But weaponless all, and wise they stood, In the level dawn, and calm brotherly good; Yet bowed to him they, and kiss'd his hands, For such were their new good lord's commands, Lessons rather, and brotherly plea; Reverence the past, O brothers, quoth he; Reverence the struggle and mystery, And faces human in their pain; Nor his the least that could sustain Cares of mighty wars, and guide Calmly where the red deaths ride. “But how! what now?” cried Captain Sword; “Not a blow for your gen'ral? not even a word? What! traitors? deserters?” “Ah no!” cried they; “But the ‘game's’ at an end; the ‘wise’ won't play.” “And where's your old spirit?” “The same, though another; Man may be strong without maiming his brother.” “But enemies?” “Enemies! Whence should they come, When all interchange what was but known to some?” “But famine? but plague? worse evils by far.” “O last mighty rhet'ric to charm us to war! Look round—what has earth, now it equably speeds, To do with these foul and calamitous needs? Now it equably speeds, and thoughtfully glows, And its heart is open, never to close?” “Still I can govern,” said Captain Sword; “Fate I respect; and I stick to my word.” And in truth so he did; but the word was one He had sworn to all vanities under the sun, To do, for their conq'rors, the least could be done. Besides, what had he with his worn-out story, To do with the cause he had wrong'd, and the glory? No! Captain Sword a sword was still, He could not unteach his lordly will; He could not attemper his single thought; It might not be bent, nor newly wrought: And so, like the tool of a disused art, He stood at his wall, and rusted apart. 'Twas only for many-soul'd Captain Pen To make a world of swordless men. ABOU BEN ADHEM. Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!) Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, And saw, within the moonlight in his room, Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, An angel writing in a book of gold:— Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, And to the presence in the room he said, “What writest thou?”—The vision rais'd its head, And with a look made of all sweet accord, Answer'd, “The names of those who love the Lord.” “And is mine one?” said Abou. “Nay, not so,” Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low, But cheerly still; and said, “I pray thee then, Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.” The angel wrote, and vanish'd. The next night It came again with a great wakening light, And show'd the names whom love of God had bless'd, And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest. JAFFÀR. INSCRIBED TO THE MEMORY OF SHELLEY. Shelley, take this to thy dear memory;— To praise the generous, is to think of thee. Jaffàr, the Barmecide, the good Vizier, The poor man's hope, the friend without a peer, Jaffàr was dead, slain by a doom unjust; And guilty Hàroun, sullen with mistrust Of what the good and e'en the bad might say, Ordain'd that no man living from that day Should dare to speak his name on pain of death.— All Araby and Persia held their breath. All but the brave Mondeer.—He, proud to show How far for love a grateful soul could go, And facing death for very scorn and grief (For his great heart wanted a great relief,) Stood forth in Bagdad, daily in the square Where once had stood a happy house; and there Harangued the tremblers at the scymitar On all they owed to the divine Jaffàr. “Bring me this man,” the caliph cried. The man Was brought—was gaz'd upon. The mutes began To bind his arms. “Welcome, brave cords,” cried he; “From bonds far worse Jaffàr deliver'd me; From wants, from shames, from loveless household fears; Made a man's eyes friends with delicious tears; Restor'd me—lov'd me—put me on a par With his great self. How can I pay Jaffàr?” Hàroun, who felt that on a soul like this The mightiest vengeance could but fall amiss, Now deign'd to smile, as one great lord of fate Might smile upon another half as great. He said, “Let worth grow frenzied, if it will; The caliph's judgment shall be master still. Go: and since gifts thus move thee, take this gem, The richest in the Tartar's diadem, And hold the giver as thou deemest fit.” “Gifts!” cried the friend. He took; and holding it High tow'rds the heavens, as though to meet his star, Exclaim'd “This too I owe to thee, Jaffàr.” THE BITTER GOURD. Lokman the Wise, therefore the Good (for wise Is but sage good, seeing with final eyes), Was slave once to a lord, jealous though kind, Who, piqued sometimes at the man's master mind, Gave him, one day, to see how he would treat So strange a grace, a bitter gourd to eat. With simplest reverence, and no surprise, The sage receiv'd what stretch'd the donor's eyes; And, piece by piece, as though it had been food To feast and gloat on, every morsel chew'd; And so stood eating, with his patient beard, Till all the nauseous favour disappear'd. Vex'd, and confounded, and dispos'd to find Some ground of scorn, on which to ease his mind, “Lokman!” exclaim'd his master,—“In God's name, Where could the veriest slave get soul so tame? Have all my favours been bestow'd amiss? Or could not brains like thine have saved thee this?” Calmly stood Lokman still, as duty stands.— “Have I receiv'd,” he answered, “at thine hands Favours so sweet they went to mine heart's ro ot, And could I not accept one bitter fruit?” “O Lokman!” said his lord (and as he spoke, For very love his words in softness broke), “Take but this favour yet:—be slave no more:— Be, as thou art, my friend and counsellor: Oh be; nor let me quit thee, self-abhorr'd;— 'Tis I that am the slave, and thou the lord.” THE INEVITABLE. INSCRIBED TO JOHN FORSTER. Forster, whose voice can speak of awe so well, And stern disclosures, new and terrible, This were a tale, my friend, for thee to tell. Seek for it then in some old book; but take Meantime this version, for the writer's sake. The royal sage, lord of the Magic Ring, Solomon, once upon a morn in spring, By Cedron, in his garden's rosiest walk, Was pacing with a pleasant guest in talk, When they beheld, approaching, but with face Yet undiscern'd, a stranger in the place. How he came there, what wanted, who could be, How dare, unusher'd, beard such privacy, Whether 'twas some great Spirit of the Ring, And if so, why he should thus daunt the king (For the ring's master, after one sharp gaze, Stood waiting, more in trouble than amaze), All this the courtier would have ask'd; but fear Palsied his utterance, as the man drew near. The stranger seem'd (to judge him by his dress) One of mean sort, a dweller with distress, Or some poor pilgrim; but the steps he took Belied it with strange greatness; and his look Open'd a page in a tremendous book. He wore a cowl, from under which there shone, Full on the guest, and on the guest alone, A face, not of this earth, half veil'd in gloom And radiance, but with eyes like lamps of doom, Which, ever as they came, before them sent Rebuke, and staggering, and astonishment, With sense of change, and worse of change to be, Sore sighing, and extreme anxiety, And feebleness, and faintness, and moist brow, The past a scoff, the future crying “Now!” All that makes wet the pores, and lifts the hair; All that makes dying vehemence despair, Knowing it must be dragg'd it knows not where. Th' excess of fear and anguish, which had tied The courtier's tongue, now loos'd it, and he cried, “O royal master! Sage! Lord of the Ring, I cannot bear the horror of this thing; Help with thy mighty art. Wish me, I pray, On the remotest mountain of Cathay.” Solomon wish'd, and the man vanish'd. Straight Up comes the terror, with his orbs of fate. “Solomon,” with a lofty voice said he, “How came that man here, wasting time with thee? I was to fetch him, ere the close of day, From the remotest mountain of Cathay.” Solomon said, bowing him to the ground, “Angel of Death, there will the man be found.” WALLACE AND FAWDON. This ballad was suggested by one of the notes to the Lay of the Last Minstrel. Wallace, the great Scottish patriot, had been defeated in a sharp encounter with the English. He was forced to retreat with only sixteen followers; the English pursued him with a bloodhound; and his sole chance of escape from that tremendous investigator was either in baffling the scent altogether (which was impossible, unless fugitives could take to the water, and continue there for some distance), or in confusing it by the spilling of blood. For the latter purpose, a captive was sometimes sacrificed; in which case the hound stopped upon the body. The supernatural part of the story of Fawdon is treated by its first relator, Harry the Minstrel, as a mere legend, and that not a very credible one; but as a mere legend it is very fine, and quite sufficient for poetical purposes; nor should the old poet's philosophy have thought proper to gainsay it. Nevertheless, as the mysteries of the conscience are more awful things than any merely gratuitous terror (besides leaving optical phenomena quite as real as the latter may find them), even the supernatural part of the story becomes probable when we consider the agitations which the noble mind of Wallace may have undergone during such trying physical circumstances, and such extremes of moral responsibility. It seems clear, that however necessary the death of Fawdon may have been to his companions, or to Scotland, his slayer regretted it; I have suggested the kind of reason which he would most likely have had for the regret; and upon the whole, it is my opinion, that Wallace actually saw the visions, and that the legend originated in the fact. I do not mean to imply that Fawdon became present, embodied or disembodied, whatever may have been the case with his image. I only say that what the legend reports Wallace to have seen, was actually in the hero's eyes. The remainder of the question I leave to the psychologist. PART THE FIRST. Wallace with his sixteen men Is on his weary way; They have hasting been all night, And hasting been all day; And now, to lose their only hope, They hear the bloodhound bay. The bloodhound's bay comes down the wind, Right upon the road; Town and tower are yet to pass, With not a friend's abode. Wallace neither turn'd nor spake; Closer drew the men; Little had they said that day, But most went cursing then. Oh! to meet twice sixteen foes Coming from English ground, And leave their bodies on the track, To cheat King Edward's hound. Oh! to overtake one wretch That left them in the fight, And leave him cloven to the ribs, To mock the bloody spite. Suddenly dark Fawdon stopp'd, As they near'd a town; He stumbled with a desperate oath, And cast him fiercely down. He said, “The leech took all my strength, My body is unblest; Come dog, come devil, or English rack, Here must Fawdon rest.” Fawdon was an Irishman Had join'd them in the war; Four orphan children waited him Down by Eden Scawr. But Wallace hated Fawdon's ways, That were both fierce and shy; And at his words he turn'd, and said, “That's a traitor's lie. “No thought is thine of lingering here, A captive for the hound; Thine eye is bright; thy lucky flesh Hath not a single wound; The moment we depart, the lane Will see thee from the ground.” Fawdon would not speak nor stir, Speak as any might; Scorn'd or sooth'd, he sat and lour'd, As though in angry spite. Wallace drew a little back, And waved his men apart; And Fawdon half leap'd up and cried, “Thou wilt not have the heart!” Wallace with his dreadful sword, Without further speech, Clean cut off dark Fawdon's head, Through its stifled screech: Through its stifled screech, and through The arm that fenc'd his brow; And Fawdon, as he leap'd, fell dead, And safe is Wallace now. Safe is Wallace with his men, And silent is the hound; And on their way to Castle Gask They quit the sullen ground. PART THE SECOND. Wallace lies in Castle Gask, Safely with his men; Not a soul has come, three days, Within the warder's ken. Safely with his men lies Wallace, Yet he fareth ill; There is fever in his blood; His mind may not be still. It was night, and all were housed, Talking long and late; Who is this that blows the horn At the castle-gate? Who is this that blows a horn Which none but Wallace hears? Loud and louder grows the blast In his frenzied ears. He sends by twos, he sends by threes, He sends them all to learn; He stands upon the stairs, and calls, But none of them return. Wallace flings him forth down stairs; And there the moonlight fell Across the yard upon a sight, That makes him seem in hell. Fawdon's headless trunk he sees, With an arm in air, Brandishing his bloody head By the swinging hair. Wallace with a stifled screech Turn'd and fled amain, Up the stairs, and through the bowers With a burning brain: From a window Wallace leap'd Fifteen feet to ground, And never stopp'd till fast within A nunnery's holy bound. And then he turn'd, in gasping doubt, To see the fiend retire, And saw him not at hand, but saw Castle Gask on fire. All on fire was Castle Gask; And on its top, endued With the bulk of half a tower, Headless Fawdon stood. Wide he held a burning beam, And blackly fill'd the light; His body seem'd, by some black art, To look at Wallace, heart to heart, Threatening through the night. Wallace that day week arose From a feeble bed; And gentle though he was before, Yet now to orphans evermore He gentlier bow'd his head, KILSPINDIE. King James to royal Stirling town Was riding from the chase, When he was ware of a banish'd man Return'd without his grace. The man stood forward from the crowd In act to make appeal; Said James, but in no pleasant tone, “Yonder is my Grey-steel.” He knew him not by his attire, Which was but poor in plight; He knew him not by his brown curls, For they were turned to white; He knew him not by followers, For want had made them strange; He knew him by his honest look, Which time could never change. Kilspindie was a Douglas bold, Who, when the king was young, Had pleas'd him like the grim Grey-steel, Of whom sweet verse is sung: Had pleas'd him by his sword that cropp'd The knights of their renown, And by a foot so fleet and firm, No horse could tire it down. But James hath sworn an angry oath, That as he was King crown'd, No Douglas evermore should set His foot on Scottish ground. Too bold had been the Douglas race, Too haughty and too strong; Only Kilspindie of them all Had never done him wrong. “A boon! a boon!” Kilspindie cried; “Pardon that here am I: In France I have grown old and sad, In Scotland I would die.” Kilspindie knelt, Kilspindie bent, His Douglas pride was gone; The King he neither spoke nor look'd, But sternly rode straight on. Kilspindie rose, and pace for pace Held on beside the train, His cap in hand, his looks in hope, His heart in doubt and pain. Before them lay proud Stirling hill, The way grew steep and strong; The King shook bridle suddenly, And up swept all the throng. Kilspindie said within himself, “He thinks of Auld Lang Syne, And wishes pleasantly to see What strength may still be mine.” On rode the court, Kilspindie ran, His smile grew half distress'd; There wasn't a man in that company, Save one, but wish'd him rest. Still on they rode, and still ran he, His breath he scarce could get; There wasn't a man in that company, Save one, with eyes unwet. The King has enter'd Stirling town, Nor ever graced him first; Kilspindie sat him down, and ask'd Some water for his thirst. But they had mark'd the monarch's face, And how he kept his pride: And old Kilspindie in his need Is water's self denied. Ten weeks thereafter, sever'd still From Scotland's dear embrace, Kilspindie died of broken heart, Sped by that cruel race. Ten years thereafter, his last breath King James as sadly drew; And though he died of many thoughts, Kilspindie cross'd him too, THE TRUMPETS OF DOOLKARNEIN. In Eastern history are two Iskanders, or Alexanders, who are sometimes confounded, and both of whom are called Doolkarnein, or the Two-Horned, in allusion to their subjugation of East and West, horns being an oriental symbol of power. One of these heroes is Alexander of Macedon, the other a conqueror of more ancient times, who built the marvellous series of ramparts on Mount Caucasus, known in fable as the wall of Gog and Magog, that is to say, of the people of the North. It reached from the Euxine Sea to the Caspian, where its flanks originated the subsequent appellation of the Caspian Gates. See (among other passages in the same work) the article entitled “Jagioug et Magioug,” in D'Herbelot's Bibliothèque Orientale. The story of the Trumpets, on which the present poem is founded, is quoted by Major Price, in his History of the Arabs before the Time of Mahomet, from the old Italian collection of tales entitled The Pecorone, the work of Ser Giovanni Fiorentino. With awful walls, far glooming, that possess'd The passes 'twixt the snow-fed Caspian fountains, Doolkarnein, the dread lord of East and West, Shut up the northern nations in their mountains; And upon platforms where the oak-trees grew, Trumpets he set, huge beyond dreams of wonder, Craftily purpos'd, when his arms withdrew, To make him thought still hous'd there, like the thunder: And it so fell; for when the winds blew right, They woke their trumpets to their calls of might. Unseen, but heard, their calls the trumpets blew, Ringing the granite rocks, their only bearers, Till the long fear into religion grew, And never more those heights had human darers. Dreadful Doolkarnein was an earthly god; His walls but shadow'd forth his mightier frowning; Armies of giants at his bidding trod From realm to realm, king after king discrowning. When thunder spoke, or when the earthquake stirr'd, Then, muttering in accord, his host was heard. But when the winters marr'd the mountain shelves, And softer changes came with vernal mornings, Something had touch'd the trumpets' lofty selves, And less and less rang forth their sovereign warnings: Fewer and feebler; as when silence spreads In plague-struck tents, where haughty chiefs, left dying, Fail by degrees upon their angry beds, Till, one by one, ceases the last stern sighing. One by one, thus, their breath the trumpets drew, Till now no more the imperious music blew. Is he then dead? Can great Doolkarnein die? Or can his endless hosts elsewhere be needed? Were the great breaths that blew his minstrelsy Phantoms, that faded as himself receded? Or is he anger'd? Surely he still comes; This silence ushers the dread visitation; Sudden will burst the torrent of his drums, And then will follow bloody desolation. So did fear dream; though now, with not a sound To scare good hope, summer had twice crept round. Then gather'd in a band, with lifted eyes, The neighbours, and those silent heights ascended. Giant, nor aught blasting their bold emprize, They met, though twice they halted, breath suspended; Once, at a coming like a god's in rage With thunderous leaps; but 'twas the piled snow, falling; And once, when in the woods, an oak, for age, Fell dead, the silence with its groan appalling. At last they came where still, in dread array, As though they still might speak, the trumpets lay. Unhurt they lay, like caverns above ground, The rifted rocks, for hands, about them clinging, Their tubes as straight, their mighty mouths as round And firm, as when the rocks were first set ringing. Fresh from their unimaginable mould They might have seem'd, save that the storms had stain'd them With a rich rust, that now, with gloomy gold In the bright sunshine, beauteously engrain'd them. Breathless the gazers look'd, nigh faint for awe, Then leap'd, then laugh'd. What was it now they saw? Myriads of birds. Myriads of birds, that fill'd The trumpets all with nests and nestling voices! The great, huge, stormy music had been still'd By the soft needs that nurs'd those small, sweet noises! O thou Doolkarnein, where is now thy wall? Where now thy voice divine and all thy forces? Great was thy cunning, but its wit was small Compar'd with Nature's least and gentlest courses. Fears and false creeds may fright the realms awhile; But Heaven and Earth abide their time, and smile. BALLADS OF ROBIN HOOD. (FOR CHILDREN.) These ballads are founded on the popular assumption that the good outlaw Robin Hood, “the gentlest of thieves,” as the old historian called him, was of “gentle blood.” It is a very good and very probable assumption, considering how the Saxon gentry in his time were robbed of their estates by their Norman tyrants; and it ought never to be more popular than now, when to feel for the sufferings of all classes, and endeavour to advance the whole human race, is a mark of the highest education, that of the sovereign included. The author adopted the metrical license of the old ballads while writing on this subject, but it was not his object to confine himself to their manner. ROBIN HOOD A CHILD. It was the pleasant season yet, When the stones at cottage doors Dry quickly while the roads are wet, After the silver showers. The green leaves they look'd greener still, And the thrush, renewing his tune, Shook a loud note from his gladsome bill Into the bright blue noon. Robin Hood's mother look'd out, and said, “It were a shame and a sin, For fear of getting a wet head, To keep such a day within, Nor welcome up from his sick bed Your uncle Gamelyn.” And Robin leap'd for mirth and glee, And so they quit the door, And “Mother, I'm your dog,” quoth he, And scamper'd on before. Robin was a gentle boy, And therewithal as bold; To say he was his mother's joy, It were a phrase too cold. His hair upon his thoughtful brow Came smoothly clipp'd, and sleek, But ran into a curl somehow Beside his merrier cheek. Great love to him his uncle, too, The noble Gamelyn bare, And often said, as his mother knew, That he should be his heir. Gamelyn's eyes, now getting dim, Would twinkle at his sight, And his ruddy wrinkles laugh at him Between his locks so white: For Robin already let him see He should beat his playmates all At wrestling, and running, and archery, For he cared not for a fall. Now and then his gall arose, And into a rage he flew; But 'twas only at such as Tom Harden's blows, Who, when he had given a bloody nose, Used to mimic the cock when he crows; Otherwise Rob laugh'd too. Merriest he was of merry boys, And would set the old helmets bobbing: If his uncle ask'd about the noise, 'Twas “If you please, sir, Robin.” And yet if the old man wish'd no noise, He'd come and sit at his knee, And be the gravest of grave-eyed boys, And not a word spoke he. So whenever he and his mother came To brave old Shere Wood Hall, 'Twas nothing there but sport and game, And holiday folks all: The servants never were to blame, Though they let the pasty fall. And now the travellers turn the road, And now they hear the rooks; And there it is,—the old abode, With all its hearty looks. Robin laugh'd, and the lady too, And they look'd at one another; Says Robin, “I'll knock as I'm used to do At uncle's window, mother.” And so he pick'd up some pebbles and ran, And jumping higher and higher, He reach'd the windows with tan a ran tan, And instead of the kind old white-hair'd man, There look'd out a fat friar. “How now,” said the fat friar angrily, “What is this knocking so wild?” But when he saw young Robin's eye, He said, “Go round, my child. “Go round to the hall, and I'll tell you all.” “He'll tell us all!” thought Robin; And his mother and he went quietly, Though her heart was set a throbbing. The friar stood in the inner door, And tenderly said, “I fear You know not the good squire's no more, Even Gamelyn Shere. “Gamelyn of Shere Wood is dead, He changed but yesternight:” “Now make us way,” the lady said, “To see that doleful sight.” “Good old Gamelyn Shere is dead, And has made us his holy heirs:” The lady stay'd not for all he said, But went weeping up the stairs. Robin and she went hand in hand, Weeping all the way, Until they came where the lord of that land Dumb in his cold bed lay. His hand she took, and saw his dead look, With the lids over each eye-ball; And Robin and she wept as plenteously, As though he had left them all. “I will return, Sir Abbot of Vere, I will return, as is meet, And see my honour'd brother dear Laid in his winding sheet. “And I will stay, for to go were a sin, For all a woman's tears, And see the noble Gamelyn Laid equal with the Veres.” The lady went with a sick heart out Into the fresh air, And told her Robin all about The abbot whom he saw there: And how his uncle must have been Disturb'd in his failing sense, To leave his wealth to these artful men, At her's and Robin's expense. Sad was the stately day for all But the Vere Abbey friars, When the coffin was stript of its hiding pall, Amidst the hushing choirs. Sad was its going down into the dust, And the thought of the face departed; The lady shook at them, as shake we must, And Robin he felt strange-hearted. That self-same evening, nevertheless, They return'd to Locksley town, The lady in a sore distress, And Robin looking down. No word he spoke, no note he took Of bird, or beast, or aught, Till she ask'd him with a woful look What made him so full of thought. “I was thinking, mother,” said little Robin, And with his own voice so true He spoke right out, “That if I was a king, Or if I was a man, which is the next thing, I'd see what those friars do. “I wouldn't let 'em be counted friars, If they did as these have done, But make 'em fight, for rogues and liars; I'd make 'em fight, to see which was right, Them, or the mother's son.” His mother stoop'd with a tear of joy, And she kiss'd him again and again, And said, “My own little Robin boy, Thou wilt be a King of Men.” ROBIN HOOD'S FLIGHT. Robin Hood's mother, these ten years now, Has been gone from her earthly home; And Robin has paid, he scarce knew how, A sum for a noble tomb. The churchyard lies on a woody hill, But open to sun and air: It seems as if the heaven still Were blessing the good bones there. Often when Robin turn'd that way, He look'd through a sweet thin tear; But he look'd in a different manner, they say, Towards the Abbey of Vere. Custom had made him not care for wealth, Sincere was his mirth at pride; He had youth, and strength, and health, And enough for one beside. But he thought of his gentle mother's cheek, How it faded and sunk away, And how she used to grow more weak And weary every day: And how, when trying a hymn, her voice At evening would expire, How unlike it was the arrogant noise Of the hard throats in the choir: And Robin thought too of the poor, How they toil'd without their share, And how the alms at the abbey door But kept them as they were: And he thought him then of the friars again, Who rode jingling up and down, With their trappings and things as fine as the king's, Though they wore but a shaven crown. And then of the king bold Robin he thought, And the homes for his sports undone; How the poor were turn'd out where his deer were brought, Yet on body and soul what agonies wrought, If starving, they killed but one. And in angry mood, as Robin thus stood, Digging his bow in the ground, He was aware in old Shere Wood, Of a huckster who look'd around. “And what is Will doing?” said Robin then, “That he looks so fearful and wan?” “Oh my dear master that should have been, I am a weary man.” “A weary man,” said Will Nokes, “am I For unless I pilfer this wood To sell to the fletchers, for want I shall die Here in this forest so good. “Here in this forest where I have been So happy and so stout, And like a palfrey on the green, Have carried yourself about.” “And why, Will Nokes, not come to me? Why not to Robin, Will? For I remember thy love and thy glee, And the scar that marks thee still; “And not a soul of my uncle's men To such a pass should come, While Robin can find in his pocket or bin A penny or a crumb. “Stay thee, Will Nokes, man, stay awhile; And kindle a fire for me.” And into the wood for half a mile, He has vanish'd instantly. Robin Hood, with his cheek on fire, Has drawn his bow so stern, And a leaping deer, with one leap higher, Lies motionless in the fern. Robin, like a proper knight, As he should have been, Carv'd a part of the shoulder right, And bore off a portion clean. “Oh, what hast thou done, dear master mine, What hast thou done for me?” “Roast it, Will, for excepting wine, Thou shalt feast thee royally.” And Nokes he took and half roasted it, Blubbering with blinding tears, And ere he had eaten a second bit, A trampling came to their ears. They heard the tramp of a horse's feet, And they listen'd and kept still, For Will was feeble, and knelt by the meat; And Robin he stood by Will. “Seize him, seize him!” the Abbot cried With his fat voice through the trees; Robin a smooth arrow felt and eyed, And Will jump'd stout with his knees. Time had made the fat Abbot, I trow, A fatter and angrier man; Yet the voice was the same that twelve years ago Out of the window, to Robin below, Answer'd the tan a ran tan. “Seize him! seize him!” and now they appear, The Abbot and foresters three: “'Twas I,” cried Will, “that slew the deer:” Says Robin, “Now let not a man come near, Or he's dead as dead can be.” But on they came, and with gullet cleft The first one met the shaft; And he fell with a face of all mirth bereft, That just before had laugh'd. The others turn'd to that Abbot vain, But “Seize him!” still he cried, And as the second man turn'd again, The second man shriek'd and died. “Seize him, seize him still, I say,” Cried the Abbot, in furious chafe, “Or these dogs will grow so bold some day, E'en monks will not be safe.” A fatal word! for as he sat, Urging the sword to cut, An arrow stuck in his paunch so fat, As in a leathern butt: As in a leathern butt of wine, Or piece of beef so round, Stuck that arrow, strong and fine; Sharp had it been ground. I know not what the Abbot, alack! Thought when that was done; But there tumbled from the horse's back A matter of twenty stone. “Truly,” said Robin without fear, Smiling there as he stood, “Never was slain so fat a deer In good old Gamelyn's wood.” “Pardon, pardon, Sir Robin stout,” Said he that stood apart, “As soon as I knew thee, I wish'd thee ou Of the forest with all my heart. “And I pray thee let me follow thee Anywhere under the sky, For thou wilt never stay here with me, Nor without thee can I.” Robin smiled, and suddenly fell Into a little thought; And then into a leafy dell The three slain men they brought. Ankle deep in leaves so red, Which autumn there had cast, When going to her winter bed She had undrest her last. And there in a hollow, side by side, They buried them under the treen; The Abbot's belly, for all its pride, Made not the grave be seen. Robin Hood, and the forester, And Nokes the happy Will, Struck off among the green leaves there Up a pathless hill; And Robin caught a sudden sight Of merry sweet Locksley town, Reddening in the sunset bright; And the gentle tears came down. Robin look'd at the town and land, And the churchyard where it lay; And loving Will he kiss'd his hand, And turn'd his head away. Then Robin turn'd with a grasp of Will's, And clapp'd him on the shoulder, And said, with one of his pleasant smiles, “Now show us three men bolder.” And so they took their march away, As firm as if to fiddle, To journey that night and all next day, With Robin Hood in the middle. ROBIN HOOD AN OUTLAW. Robin Hood is an outlaw bold, Under the greenwood tree; Bird, nor stag, nor morning air, Is more at large than he. They sent against him twenty men, Who join'd him laughing-eyed; They sent against him thirty more, And they remain'd beside. All the stoutest of the train That grew in Gamelyn wood, Whether they came with these or not, Are now with Robin Hood. And not a soul in Locksley town Would speak him an ill word; The friars raged; but no man's tongue, Nor even feature stirred; Except among a very few, Who dined in the Abbey halls; And then with a sigh bold Robin knew His true friends from his false. There was Roger the monk, that used to make All monkery his glee; And Midge, on whom Robin had never turn'd His face but tenderly; With one or two, they say, besides— Lord! that in this life's dream Men should abandon one true thing, That would abide with them. We cannot bid our strength remain, Our cheeks continue round; We cannot say to an aged back, Stoop not towards the ground: We cannot bid our dim eyes see Things as bright as ever, Nor tell our friends, though friends from youth, That they'll forsake us never: But we can say, I never will, False world, be false for thee; And, oh Sound Truth and Old Regard, Nothing shall part us three. HOW ROBIN AND HIS OUTLAWS LIVED IN THE WOODS. Robin and his merry men Liv'd just like the birds; They had almost as many tracks as thoughts, And whistles and songs as words. All the morning they were wont To fly their gray-goose quills At butts, or trees, or wands and twigs, Till theirs was the skill of skills. With swords, too, they played lustily, And at quarter-staff; Buffets oft their forfeits were, Fit to twirl a calf. Friends who join'd the sport were bound Those hazards to endure; But foes were lucky to carry away What took a year to cure. The horn was then their dinner-bell; When, like princes of the wood, Under the state of summer trees, Pure venison was their food. Pure venison and good ale or wine, Except when luck was chuff; Or grant 'twas Adam's ale; what then? Their blood was wine enough. And story then, and jest, and song, And Harry's harp went round; And sometimes they'd get up and dance, For pleasure at the sound. Tingle, tangle! said the harp, As they footed in and out: Good Lord! was ever seen a dance At once so light and stout? A pleasant sight, especially If Margery was there, Or little Cis, or laughing Bess, That tired out six pair. Or any other merry lass From the neighbouring villages, Who came with milk and eggs, or fruit, A singing through the trees. Only they say the men were given Too often to take wives, And then, 'twixt forest and a shop, Lead strange half-honest lives. But all the country round about Was fond of Robin Hood, With whom they got a share of more Than fagots from the wood. Nor ever would he suffer harm, To woman, above all; No plunder, were she ne'er so great, No fright to great or small; No,—not a single kiss unliked, Nor one look-saddening clip; Accurst be he, said Robin Hood, Makes pale a woman's lip. And then, oh then, Maid Marian came From her proud brother's hall, With a world of love and tears, And smiles behind them all. They built her bowers in forests three, To flit from one to t'other, And Robin and she reign'd as pleasant to all, As faithful to one another. Only upon the Normans proud, And on their unjust store, He'd lay his fines of equity For his merry men and the poor. And special was his joy, no doubt, (Which made the dish to curse,) To light upon a good fat friar, And carve him of his purse. A monk to him was a toad in the hole, And a priest was a pig in grain, But a bishop was a baron of beef, To cut and come again. Says Robin to the poor who came To ask of him relief, You do but get your goods again That were altered by the thief. See here now is a plump new coin, And here's a lawyer's cloak, And here's the horse the bishop rode, When suddenly he woke. Well, ploughman, there's a sheaf of yours Turn'd to yellow gold: And, miller, there's your last year's rent, 'Twill wrap thee from the cold. And you there, Wat of Herefordshire, Who such a way have come, Get upon your land-tax, man, And ride it merrily home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Narrative Modernizations. DEATH AND THE RUFFIANS, MODERNIZED FROM CHAUCER. Three drunken ruffians, madly believing Death to be an embodied person, go out to kill him. They meet him in the shape of an old man, who tells them where Death is to be found; and they find him accordingly. In Flanders there was once a desperate set Of three young spendthrifts, fierce with drink and debt, Who, haunting every sink of foul repute, And giddy with the din of harp and lute, Went dancing and sat gambling day and night, And swill'd and gorg'd beyond their natures' might, And thus upon the devil's own altar laid The bodies and the souls that God had made. So horribly they swore with every word, They seem'd to think the Jews had spar'd our Lord, That rent his body; and the worse they swore, And scoff'd, and sinn'd, they did but laugh the more. Their doors were ever turning on the pin To let their timbrellers and tumblers in, Sellers of cakes and such-like;—every one A devil's own help to see his business done, And blow up fires, far better, Sirs, made less, Out of th' accursed fuel of excess. These wretches, having lost one night at play, Were drinking still by the sad dawn of day, When hearing a bell go for some one dead, They curs'd, and call'd the vintner's boy, and said, “Who's he that has been made cold meat to-night? Ask the fool's name, and see you bring it right?” The boy who had been sick, and in whose head Something had put strange and grave matter, said, “Nay, Sirs, 'twas Hob the smith. You knew him well; A big-mouth'd, red-hair'd man; you call'd him Hell. Last evening he was sitting, bolt upright, Too drunk to speak, when in there came a wight Whom men call Death, that slayeth high and low; And with his staff Death fell'd him at a blow, And so, without one word, betook him hence. He hath slain heaps during the pestilence. And, Sirs, they say, the boldest man had best Beware how he invites so grim a guest, Or be prepar'd to meet him, night and day. 'Tis what, long since, I've heard my mother say.” “Ay,” quoth the vinter, “every word you hear Is true as gospel. He hath slain this year, And barely with his presence, half the place. God grant we meet not with his dreadful face.” “God grant a fig's end,” exclaim'd one. “Who's he Goes blasting thus fool's eyes? Let's forth, we three, And hunt him out, and punch the musty breath Out of his bones, and be the death of Death.” 'Twixt rage and liquor staggering forth they flung, And on their impious oaths their changes rung, And then would pause, and gathering all the breath Their shouts had left them, cry out, “Death to Death!” They had not gone a furlong, when they met, Beside a bridge that cross'd a rivulet, A poor old man, who meekly gave them way, And bow'd, and said, “God save ye, Sirs, I pray.” The foremost swaggerer, prouder for the bow, Said, “Well, old crawler, what art canting now? Why art thou thus wrapp'd up, all save thy face? Why liv'st so long, in such a sorry case?” The old man began looking steadfastly Into the speaker's visage, eye to eye, And said, “Because I cannot find the man, Nor could, though I had walk'd since time began, No, not the poorest man, nor the least sage, Who would exchange his youth for mine old age: And therefore must I keep mine old age still, As long as it shall please th' Almighty's will. Death will not rid me of this aching breast; And thus I walk, because I cannot rest, And on the ground, my mother Nature's gate, I knock with mine old staff, early and late, And say to her,—Dear mother, let me in. Lo! how I vanish, flesh, and blood, and skin. When shall I sleep for good? Oh, mother dear, The coffin which has stood this many a year By my bedside, full gladly would I give For a bare shroud, so I might cease to live;— And yet she will not do me, Sirs, that grace; For which full pale and wrinkled is my face. “But, Sirs, in you it is no courtesy To mock an old man, whosoe'er he be, Much less a harmless man in deed and word. The Scripture, as in church ye may have heard, Saith,—‘To an old man, hoar upon his head, Ye shall bow down.’ Therefore let this be said By poor me now—Unto an old man do Nought which in age ye'd not have done to you.— And so God guard ye, Sirs, in weal or woe. I must go onward, where I have to go.” “Nay,” t'other cried, “Old Would-be-Dead and Gone, Thou partest not so lightly, by Saint John. Thou spak'st but now of that false villain Death, Who stoppeth here a world of honest breath: Where doth he bide? Tell us, or by the Lord, And Judas, and the jump in hempen cord, As surely as thou art his knave and spy, We'll hang thee out, for thine old rheums to dry. Thou art his privy nipper, thou old thief, Blighting and blasting all in the green leaf.” “Sirs,” quoth the old man, “spare, I pray, your breaths: Death ye would find, and this your road is Death's. Ye see yon spread of oaks, down by the brook; There doth he lie, sunn'd in a flowery nook.” Death sunning in a flowery nook! How flies Each drunkard o'er the sward, to smite him as he lies! They reach the nook: and what behold they there! No Death, but yet a sight to make them stare; To make them stare, not out of mortal dread, But only for huge bliss and stounded head; To wit, pour'd forth, countless and deep and broad, As if some cart had there discharg'd its load, A bank of florins of fine gold,—all bright, Fresh from the mint, plump, ponderous. What a sight! They laugh'd, they leapt, they flung to earth, and roll'd Their souls and bodies in the glorious gold; And then they sat and commun'd; and the worst Of all the three was he that spoke the first. “God's life!” quoth he; “here's treasure! here's a day! Hush;—look about. Now hark to what I say. This store that luck hath sent us, boys,—ho! ho! As freely as it came, shall it not go? By G?, it shall: and precious nights we'll spend. Who thought friend Death would make so good an end? This is a wizard's work, to 'scape us, hey? No matter. 'Tis hard gold, and well shall pay. But how to store it, Sirs, to get it hous'd? Help must be shunn'd. Men's marvel would be rous'd. Wherefore I hold that we draw lots, and he To whom it falls betake him suddenly To town, and bring us victuals here, and wine, Two keeping watch till all the three can dine; And then at night we'll get us spades, and here, In its own ground, the gold shall disappear.” The lots are drawn, the youngest thief sets off; And then the first, after a little cough, Resum'd—“I say,—we two are of one mind; Thou know'st it well; and he but a mean hind. 'Twas always so. We were the merry men, And he the churl and sot. Well, mark me then. This heap of money, ravishing to see, The fool supposes must be shar'd by three. But—hey? Just so. You think, as wise men do, That three men's shares are better shar'd by two.” “Yet how?” said t'other. “How!” said he:—“'tis done, As easily as counting two to one. He sitteth down; thou risest as in jest, And while thou tumblest with him, breast to breast, I draw my dirk, and thrust him in the side: Thine follows mine; and then we two divide The lovely gold. What say'st thou, dearest friend? Lord! of our lusty life were seen no end.” The bond was made. The journeyer to the town Meantime had in his heart roll'd up and down The beauty of the florins, hard and bright. “Christ Lord!” thought he, “what if I had the right To all this treasure, my own self alone! There's not a living man beneath the throne Of God that should be half so blest as I.” And thus he ponder'd, till the Enemy, The Fiend, who found his nature nothing loth, Whisper'd him, “Poison them. They're villains both. Always they cheat thee; sometimes beat thee; oft Carp at thy brains. Prove now whose brains are soft.” With speed a shop he seeketh, where is sold Poison for vermin; and a tale hath told Of rats and polecats that molest his fowl. “Sir,” quoth the shopman, “God so guard my soul, As thou shalt have a drug so pure and strong To slay the knaves that do thy poultry wrong, That were the hugest creature on God's earth To taste it, stricken would be all his mirth From out his heart, and life from out his sense, Ere he could drag his body a mile hence.” The cursed wretch, too happy to delay, Grasping the box of poison, takes his way To the next street, and buys three flasks of wine. Two he drugs well against his friends shall dine, And with a mark secures the harmless one, To drink at night-time till his work be done; For all that night he looks to have no sleep, So well he means to hide his golden heap. And thus thrice arm'd, and full of murderous glee, Back to the murderous two returneth he. What needeth more? for even as their plan Had shaped his death, right so hath died the man; And even as the flasks in train were set, His heirs and scorners fall into his net. “Ace thrown,” quoth one, smiling a smile full grim; Now for his wine, and then we'll bury him.” And seizing the two flasks, each held his breath With eyes to heav'n, and deep he drank his death. CAMBUS KHAN. A FRAGMENT. 1823. A stranger brings to the King of Tartary, while he is feasting, certain wonderful presents, among which is a brazen horse, which the monarch rides. At Sarra, in the land of Tartary, There dwelt a king, and with the Russ warr'd he, Through which there perish'd many a doughty man; And Cambus was he call'd, the noble Khan. Nowhere, in all that region, had a crown Been ever worn with such entire renown. Hardy he was, and true, and rich, and wise, Always the same; serene of soul and eyes; Piteous and just, benign and honourable, Of his brave heart as any centre stable; And therewithal he ever kept a state So fit to uphold a throne so fortunate, That there was nowhere such another man. This noble king, this Tartar, Cambus Khan, Had by the late Queen Elfeta, his wife, Two sons, named Cambalu and Algarsife, And a dear daughter, Canace by name, Whose perfect beauty puts my pen to shame. If you could see my heart, it were a glass To show perhaps how fair a thing she was; But when I speak of her, my tongue appears To fail me, looking in that face of hers. 'Tis well for me that I regard not those, Who love what I do, as my natural foes; Or when I think how dear she is to be To one that will adorn this history, And how her heart will love him in return, My paper, sooner than be touch'd, should burn: But she knows nothing of all this at present She's only young, and innocent, and pleasant; And sometimes by her father sits and sighs, On which he stoops to kiss her gentle-lidded eyes. And so befell, that when this Khan supreme Had twenty winters borne his diadem, He bade the feast of his nativity Be cried through Sarra, as 'twas wont to be. It was in March; and the young lusty year Came in with such a flood of golden cheer, That the quick birds, against the sunny sheen, What for the season and the thickening green, Sung their affections loudly o'er the fields: They seem'd to feel that they had got them shields Against the sword of winter, keen and cold. High is the feast in Sarra, that they hold; And Cambus, with his royal vestments on, Sits at a separate table on a throne; His sons a little lower on the right; His daughter on the left, a gentle sight; And then his peers, apart from either wall, Ranged in majestic drapery down the hall. The galleries on two sides have crowded slants Full as flow'r-shows, of ladies and gallants; And o'er the doorway, opposite the king, The proud musicians blow their shawms and sing. But to relate the whole of the array Would keep me from my tale a summer's day; And so I pass the service and the cost, The often-silenced noise, the lofty toast, And the glad symphonies that leap'd to thank The lustre-giving Lord, whene'er he drank. Suffice to say, that after the third course, His vassals, while the sprightly wine's in force, And the proud music mingles over all, Bring forth their gifts, and set them in the hall; And so befell, that when the last was set, And while the king sat thus in his estate, Hearing his minstrels playing from on high Before him at his board deliciously, All on a sudden, ere he was aware, Through the hall door, and the mute wonder there, There came a stranger on a steed of brass, And in his hand he held a looking-glass; Some sparkling ring he wore; and by his side, Without a sheath, a cutting sword was tied; And up he rides unto the royal board: In all the hall there was not spoke a word: All wait with busy looks, both young and old, To hear what wondrous thing they shall be told. The stranger, who appear'd a noble page, High-bred, and of some twenty years of age, Dismounted from his horse: and kneeling down, Bow'd low before the face that wore the crown; Then rose, and reverenc'd lady, lords and all, In order as they sat within the hall, With such observance, both in speech and air, That certainly, had Kubla's self been there, Or sage Confucius, with his courtesy, Return'd to earth to show what men should be, He could not have improv'd a single thing: Then turning lastly to address the king, Once more, but lightlier than at first, he bow'd, And in a manly voice thus spoke aloud:— “May the great Cambus to his slave be kind! My lord, the king of Araby and Ind, In honour of your feast, this solemn day, Salutes you in the manner he best may, And sends you, by a page whom he holds dear, (His happy but his humble messenger) This steed of brass; which, in a day and night, Through the dark half, as safely as the light, O'er sea and land, and with your perfect ease, Can bear your body wheresoe'er you please. It matters not if skies be foul or fair; The thing is like a thought, and cuts the air So smoothly, and so well observes the track, The man that will may sleep upon his back. All that the rider needs, when he would turn, Or rise, or take him downwards, you may learn, If it so please you, when we speak within, And does but take the writhing of a pin. “This glass too, which I hold, such is its power That if by any chance, an evil hour Befell your empire or yourself, 'twould show What men you ought to know of, friend or foe; And more than this, if any lady's heart Be set on one that plays her an ill part, Or is in aught beneath her love and her, Here she may see his real character, All his new loves, and all his old pursuits: His heart shall all be shown her, to the roots. “Therefore, my lord, with your good leave, this glass, And this green ring, the greenest ever was, My master, with his greeting, hopes may be Your excellent daughter's here, my lady Canace. “The virtues of the ring, my lord, are these— That if a lady loves the flowers and trees, And birds, and all fair Nature's ministers, And if she bear this gem within her purse, Or on her hand, like any other ring, There's not a fowl that goes upon the wing, But she shall understand his speech or strain, And in his own tongue answer him again. All plants that gardens or that fields produce, She shall be also skilled in, and their use, Whether for sweetness or for staunching wounds: No secret shall she miss, that smiles in balmy grounds. “Lastly, my lord, this sword has such a might, That let it meet the veriest fiend in fight, 'Twill carve throughout his armour the first stroke, Were it as thick as any branched oak; Nor could the wound be better for the care Of all the hands and skills that ever were; And yet, should it so please you, of your grace, To pass the flat side on the wounded place, Though it were ready to let out his soul, The flesh should close again, the man be whole. “Oh heart of hearts! that nobody shall break! Pardon me, sir, that thus my leave I take E'en of a sword, and like a lover grieve, But its own self, unbidden, will not leave The hand that wields it, though it smote a block The dullest in the land, or dash'd a rock; And this my master hopes may also be Acceptable to Tartary's majesty, With favour for himself, and pardon, sir, for me.” The Khan, who listen'd with a gracious eye, Smil'd as he stopp'd, and made a due reply, Thanking the king, his brother, for the great, Not gifts, but glories, added to his state, And saying how it pleas'd him to have known So young an honour to his neighbour's throne. The youth then gave the proper officers The gifts; who, 'midst the music's bursting airs, Laid them before the king and Canace, There as they sate, each in their high degree: But nothing that they did could move the horse; Boys might as well have tried their little force Upon a giant with his armour on: The brazen thing stood still as any stone. The stranger hasten'd to relieve their doubt, And touch'd his neck, and led him softly out; And 'twas a wonder and a joy to see How well he went, he stept so tenderly. Great was the press that from all quarters came To gaze upon this horse of sudden same; And many were the struggles to get close, And touch the mane to try if it hung loose, Or pat it on the shining flanks, or feel, The muscles in the neck that sternly swell; But the Khan's officers forbade, and fear E'en of the horse conspir'd to keep the circle clear. High was the creature built, both broad and long, And with a true proportion to be strong; And yet so “horsely” and so quick of eye, As if it were a steed of Araby; So that from tail to ear there was no part Nature herself could better, much less art; Only the people dreaded to perceive How cold it was, although it seem'd alive; And on all sides the constant wonder was How it could move, and yet was plainly brass. Of magic some discours'd, and some of powers By planets countenanced in kindly hours, Through which wise men had compass'd mighty things Of natural wit to please illustrious kings; And some fell talking of the iron chain That fell from heaven in old king Argun's reign; And then they spoke of visions in the air, And how this creature might have been born there; Of white lights heard at work, and fiery fights Seen in the north on coldest winter nights, And pale traditions of Pre-Adamites. Much did the talk run also on the sword, That harm'd and heal'd, fit gift for sovereign lord. One said that he had heard, or read somewhere, Of a great southern king with such a spear; A chief, who had for mother a sea-fairy, And slew a terror called the sagittary. As to the glass, some thought the secret lay In what geometers and others say Of angles and reflections, as a pond Shows not its sides alone, but things beyond; Iskander set one, like a sleepless eye, O'er a sea-town, far seen, and studied nigh, In which the merchant read of storms to come, Or hail'd his sunny ships blown softly home. But most the ring was talked of: every one Quoting that other ring of Solomon, Which, wheresoe'er it married, brought a dower Of wisdom, and upon the hand put power. A knowledge of the speech of birds was known To be a gift especially its own, Which made them certain that this ring of green Was part of it, perhaps a sort of skin Shed for some reason as a serpent's is; And here their reasoning was not much amiss. The wiser sort ponder'd and doubted: folly Determin'd everything, or swallow'd wholly; The close and cunning, foolishest of all, Fear'd that the whole was diabolical, And wish'd the stranger might not prove a knave Come to find out what liberal monarchs gave, And ruin with his very dangerous horses People's eternal safety, and their purses. For what it puzzles vice to comprehend, It gladly construes to the baser end. Some wits there were began at last to doubt Whether the horse could really move about, And on their finger's ends were arguing, When lo! their subject vanished from the ring; Vanish'd like lightning; an impatient beast! But hark! I hear them rising from the feast. The dinner done, Cambus arose; and all Stood up, prepar'd to follow from the hall: On either side they bend beneath his eye: “Before him goeth the loud minstrelsy;” And thus they pace into a noble room, Where dance and song were waiting till they come With throng of waxen lights that shed a thin perfume. But first the king and his young visitor Go where the horse was put, and close the door; And there the Khan learns all about the pin, And how the horse is hasten'd or held in, And turn'd, and made to rise or to descend, And all by a mere thumb and finger's end, The stranger further tells him of a word, By which the horse, the instant it is heard, Vanishes with his sparkling shape, like light, And comes again, whether it be day or night. “And, sir,” said he, “my master bade me say The first time I was honour'd in this way, (For on the throne you might prefer, he said, To wave such plain confessions from crown'd head) That one like you were fitter far than he To ride the elements like a deity, And with a speed proportion'd to your will Shine on the good, and fall upon the ill; For he, too sensual and too satisfied With what small good lay near him, like a bride, Was ever but a common king; but you A king, and a reforming conqueror, too.” Glad is great Cambus, both at this discourse, And to be master of so strange a horse, And longs to mount at once, and go and see His highest mountain tops in Tartary, Or look upon the Caspian, or appear Suddenly in Cathay, a starry fear. And any other time he would have gone, So much he long'd to put his pinions on, But on his birthday 'twas not to be done; And so they have return'd, and join'd the guests, Who wait the finish of this feast of feasts. But how shall I describe the high delight, And all the joys that danced into the night? Imagine all that should conclude a feast Giv'n by a mighty prince, and in the east, And all was here, from song to supper stand, As though it had arisen from fairy-land. The feast before it was a thing of state; But this the flowery top, and finish delicate. Here were the cushion'd sofas, the perfumes, The heavenly mirrors making endless rooms; The last quintessences of drinks; the trays Of colour'd relishes dress'd a thousand ways; The dancing girls, that bending here and there, With asking beauty lay along the air; And lighter instruments, guitars and lutes, Sprinkling their graces on the streaming flutes; And all the sounds, and all the sweets of show, Feeling victorious while the harpings go. Not all the lords were there, only the best And greatest, all in change of garments drest; And with them were the wives they thought the loveliest. You must not judge our Tartars by the tales Of nations merely eastern, and serails: The eastern manners were in due degree, But mix'd and rais'd with northern liberty; And women came with their impetuous lords, To pitch the talk and humanize the boards, And shed a gentle pleasure in the place,— The smooth alternate with the bearded face; As airs in spring come soft among the trees, And what was bluster turn to whispering ease. Our young ambassador convers'd with all, But still attendant on the sovereign's call, Who, like the rest, whatever the discourse, Was sure to turn it to the gifts and horse; Till, to the terror of some lovers, word Was giv'n to fetch the mirror and the sword; The ring, meanwhile, being handed round, and tried Upon fair fingers with a fluttering pride. Some long'd to have the birds awake, and some Were glad enough the tattling things were dumb. “Great heaven!” thought one, and seem'd to faint away, “What (ah! my Khojah!) would the parrot say?” “And what!” conceived another, “would the jay? I've often thought the wretch was going to speak, He trolls the shocking words so in his beak: I'm sure the very first would make me shriek.” Cambus, as sage as he was valiant, thought There was no need to have the creatures brought; Nor, when the mirror came, would he permit That any but himself should read in it; For which, as he perceiv'd, but mention'd not, Full thirty ladies lov'd him on the spot. As to the sword, he thought it best to try So masculine a thing in open sky; Which made him also choose to take a course Over the towers of Sarra on his horse. So issuing forth, he led into the air, Saluting the sweet moon which met him there, And forth the steed was brought; you would have said, It knew for what, so easily 'twas led, And leant with such an air its lively head. But when at rest, still as before it stood, As though its legs had to the ground been glued. Some urged it on, some dragg'd, and some would fain Have made it lift a foot, but all in vain. And yet when Cambus whisper'd it, a thrill Flash'd through its limbs, nor could its feet be still, But rock'd the body with a sprightly grace, As though it yearn'd aloft, and waited for the race. The youth had talk'd of armour like an oak, And how the sword would joint it with a stroke. The Khan had no convenient foe at hand, To see what sort of carving he could stand, But in the moon there stood some oaken trees, And suddenly he struck at one of these: Back, like a giant, fell its tow'ring size, And let the light on his victorious eyes. The blow was clearly the sword's own, and yet The Khan, as if inspir'd, felt proud of it, And leaping on the horse as suddenly, He touch'd the pin, and bade the fair good bye, And 'midst their pretty shrieks, went mounting to the sky. Cambus ascended such a height so soon, It seem'd as if he meant to reach the moon; And you might know by a tremendous shout, That not a soul in Sarra but look'd out; But the fierce noise made some of them afraid, That it might startle e'en a brazen head, And threat'ning looks were turn'd upon the youth, Who glow'd and said, “By all the faith and truth That is, or can be, in the heart of man, Nothing can happen to the noble Khan: See, he returns!” And at the word, indeed, They saw returning the descending steed; Not round and round careering, but at once; Oblique and to the point, a fervid pounce. For to say truth, the noble Khan himself, Though he had fought on many a mountain shelf, And droop'd through deserts, and been drench'd in seas, Felt somewhat strange in that great emptiness, And was not sorry to relieve his court, By cutting his return some fathom short: Such awful looks has utter novelty To dash and to confuse the boldest eye. The Khan return'd, they hasten all again To their warm room, but do not long remain: For late, and long, and highly-wrought delight Cannot, at will, resume its giddy height; And so, his story told, and praises spread From mouth to mouth, he wav'd his court to bed; Yet still in bed, and dozing oft between, Their fading words recall'd what they had seen: Still of the ring they mumbled, and the glass, And what amazing things might come to pass: And when they slept (for suppers produce dreams, And join'd with dinners, mount them to extremes) A hundred vapour-headed souls that night Went riding their own brass with all their might: They skim, they dive, they shoot about, they soar, They say,—“Why rode I not this way before? Strange! not to think of such a perfect goer! What leg that crosses brass would stoop to horseflesh more?” Ay: such quoth the wise wit, is human life: We dream of mirth, and wake, and find one's wife! Nay, quoth the wiser wit, the best way then Is to wake little, and to sleep again. Wake much, if life go right: if it go wrong, Learn how to dream with Chaucer all day long: Or learn still better, if you can, to make Your world at all times, sleeping or awake; The true receipt, whether by days or nights, To charm your griefs, and double your delights. Fancy and Fact differ in this alone; One strikes our spirit, and our substance one; But both alike can bring into our eyes The tears, and make a thousand feelings rise Of smarting wrongs or pleasant sympathies.

Among the Canterbury Pilgrims, of whom Chaucer, for the most part, has given such particular as well as admirable descriptions, mention is made of five, who appear only in their corporate capacity, as members of one and the same guild; to wit, a Haberdasher, a Carpenter, a Webbé (webber or weaver), a Deyer (dyer), and a Tapiser—that is to say, a maker of tapestry. The same term designated an upholsterer: so common was it in the days of the poet to cover with tapestry the walls of apartments. These persons, who are all represented as substantial citizens of no little importance, are said by the poet to have contributed their tales on the road to Canterbury, like the rest of the pilgrims; but none of the tales appear, Chaucer's great work having been either left unfinished, or unfortunate enough to have lost thus much of its copy. From this deficiency in its requisite quantity of matter, occasion has here been taken to suppose that the Carpenter has just been telling a tale, which his hearers have found tedious, pretentious, and wanting in good fellowship; and that the Host of the Tabard Inn, who is the guide of the pilgrimage, and the constituted arbiter in such matters, feels himself warranted in rebuking the narrator, and in calling upon another person, after his wonted jovial fashion, for a tale of a different sort. The groundwork of the story made its first English appearance in the pages of the once-vilified but now deservedly-respected old traveller, Sir John Mandeville; and the reader may find it repeated, verbatim, in the second volume, page fifty-four, of Mr. MacFarlane's excellent little work, the Romance of Travel; the only fault of which, by the way, though it has contrived to be copious too, is that it is too short. Mr. MacFarlane, after praising the legend itself, as well as its narrator, adds, that “Hafez, whose song was all of the rose and nightingale, might have sung it in Persian verse; and Dan Chaucer, our traveller's contemporary, have introduced it into his Canterbury Tales, or have made another Romaunt of the Rose about it.” Hence the present attempt;—with how much reverence for Chaucer, whether endeavouring to imitate his graver or his lighter manner, and how heartily prepared to admit objections from Chaucerophilists more devoted (if such there be), need not, it is hoped, be said. Reverence and want of reverence may equally attempt to give an idea of the manner of a master; but the one will do it with all submission, as a filial study; the other with feelings fit only to be disclaimed. THE PROLOGUE. The Carpenter, whan that his tale was done, Which sette us nigh on sleepyng everych one, Al be it sorely smote us pilgryms gay, Who gat us too moche comfort by the way, Lookéd as big and highe, as thof his lore Gaf him Saint Joseph for his auncestor. Him seemèd, thof his eyne were somedele wry, Which in wise head breedeth humilitee, As he had been yborn and designate, By that same mark, to setten all things straight; And because termés of one craft he knew, Which, save of carpenters, are known of few, That he ne wanted nought to bringe to schoole All craftés else, and rap hem with his rule. Oure Host, good Harry Bailey, colde not bide The mannés folie; and right loude he cryed, “By corpus, and by bell, and holy Luke, Ful bitter and right foule is the rebuke Thy tale hath given, Maister Carpentere, To all the good and worthie sinners here. God pardon me for saying worthie and good Of anie sort of men or multitude, For gentle and simple we are sinners all, Albeit some be grete and some be smalle, And sinnes of carpenteres none may espie, Save by some helpe of gymlet for the eie. But that which made thy bitternesse so strong. Sir Joyner, was, it was so veray long; For sette ye case, there colde be made of physick A draughte as long, who wolde not beare his tizzic, Blotches, or blaines, and rot in veray bonés, Sooner than draine swiche potion all at onés? Thou shouldst have thought, how often thou hast wishéd The sermon done while that thy meate was dishéd; For at swiche times men care but for their shinnes Of beef or pork, and nothing for their sinnes.” And thereupon whiles laughen all yfere, Oure Host he turned him to the Tapisere, And said, “Sir Tapisere, as ay tis mete That long and bitter end in short and swete, In Goddés name telleth us sodenlie Some littel mirthe or lovely tragedie, Some veray lumpe of sugar of a tale, Or ellés certés we all fainte and fayle, And may not ride but sick into the town. Grete choyce of tales hast thou, as is reasoun, Seeing what store thy needle hath ytold In wol and flax; yea, and in cloth of gold; What griesly gestés and sweete histories Of Judiths, and of Jaels, and Sir Guys, Of Arthurs, Esthers, Troy and Seneca, Saint Theseus, and the grete Duke Joshua, With hundreds moe than I may telle or think, John Prester, and the lovely Tree of Drink; And what, I note, so pleaseth clerkly pen, Susanna and the twey false aldermen. Therefore, say on. Only, in anie sort, Deare and belovéd Tapisere, be short.” The Tapisere, who was a worthy man, Said, “I wol do my beste,” and so began. THE TALE. Within a mile or twey of Bethlem toun, As holy bookés maketh mencion, Lyeth a feeld men clepe Feeld Floridus; For al so sicker as in May with us The feeldés ben daysies and cuppés alle, Which n'are but brighté weedés, chepe and smalle, This feeld, though it lye lone as anie plaine, And tended is of nought save sunne and raine, Bloometh with roses all, both redde and whyte, That everych yere men runnen to the sighte; Ne marvel is it, though a wondrous thing, For it is Goddés owné gardening; For these were the first roses ever made; And why they were, sirs, now shall it be sayd. In oldé dayés of King Gomerus, Which was the first king after Noachus, There bode in Bethlem a poore orphan mayd, Gladsome by kind, by change of fortune staid, Who wrongfully, by gealous frenesie, Was brought to judgment for unchastitie, And maugre all her true, beseechynge breth, Was dampned to the dredful fiery deth, The likest helle on erthe, even the stake. Oh puré blood, swiche feendlich thirst to slake! Alas for the soft flesche and gentil herte! Alas, why colde she not fro life asterte Softlie and sodenlie, with no moe care! Alas, that strongé men, which wol not beare The prycking of a thorne, but they must curse, And rage, and ban, and shew themselven worse Than manie a Pagan, yet, sirs, can desire To put a poore young creature to the fire! I n'ot how they colde beare the nights and dayes, That wasted her with frights and with amaze For constant thinking of that passe of helle. Beare it I may not, I, nor you it telle; And so I hasten th' executioun. Come is the daye, and crowded by the toun Is Felon's Feeld, all save the stakés place, And there full soone is seen the simple face, All redde at first, then whyte, and nothing stern, That fro the spinning-wheele was tane to burn. And “Oh, grete God!” thus dumbly prayeth she, “That willest me to beare this miserie For some just cause, though it I may not finde In the remembraunce of my feeble minde, I praye thee adde it not to mine offence If speedilie I wolde be burnéd hence, And ask the grace thereto at mannés hand.” And, with the wordes, a littel from her stand She yearnéd to the man that readie stood To put the lighted torche unto the wood, And said, “Hast thou a wife, or female child?” And he said, “Both.” And she in a sort smiled For comfort of the kindred of the man, And said, “For their sakes I beseeche thee than, That thou wilt put the wood a litel higher About me, that the sooner by the fire I may be reachéd in the throat and breth, And so be ended.” And the man of deth, The whiles he graunted her the dredfull grace, For veray pity turnd away his face, And swiftly as he colde the fagots lit. But manie in the croud colde bearen it No moe, mothers and wives in speciall, But gat them holpen back unto the wall: They felt the unborn babe stir at their hertes; So piteous swete, and void of ill desertes, She lookéd, somedele shrinking at the flame; Then hid her face, not to behold the same, And bow'd her hed, and shope her for to die. But what is this, that maketh heavenlie The aire, with smell of flowrés strange and new, As if from veray Paradise it blew, Or Heaven has opend, flowr-like, on the place? And lo! the stake; and lo! the blissful face; All blissful is the face, but now so lorne, For, of the fagots, all just lit beforne Are turnd to trees of roses, redde and brighte, And all, not lit, are turnd to roses whyte! Her foes are gone, feeble with dredfull feare; And all the croud, whiles such as standen neare Drawe back to make moe wyde the holy ring, Fall downe to kneelynge and to worshippynge: And there she standeth, shining all abrede, Like to an angell, paradysd in dede. THE SHEWE OF FAIRE SEEMING; ATTEMPTED IN THE MANNER OF SPENSER. Bearing in mind what was said in the preface to the preceding Attempt in the Manner of Chaucer, respecting the difference between reverent and irreverent endeavours of the kind, the reader will be good enough to give the author credit for the like propriety of feeling in the present instance. In an effusion which, compared with a poem so long as the Faerie Queene, is a brevity of the briefest description, several reasons have hindered him from attempting to imitate that diffuser, and at the same time more inverted portion of the manner of Spenser, in which the poet was wont to indulge himself, when expatiating at large over his unbounded domains. The author, in directing his effort more particularly to what is considered the chief characteristic of Spenser,—his allegory,—availed himself of the closer style observable in the master on occasions which tended to confine him, like a portrait-painter, to the objects immediately before him. The invention, such as it is, is the writer's own; which was the case also with the particulars in the Imitation of Chaucer, excepting the simple facts of the condemnation to the stake, the metamorphosis of the fagots into roses, and the name of Floridus which the roses gave to the place of execution. He mentions this, because some of his readers appear to have thought otherwise. The imitation of Spenser, like that of his predecessor, being assumed to be the production of the poet himself, is supposed to have been written soon after he was introduced to the family of the Sidneys. It contained a few more stanzas, the purpose of which was to show how Wisdom, strictly so called, and thoroughly understood, contained of necessity all the really prudential qualities exclusively attributed to what is called Worldly Wisdom, in order to give the latter a false character, and elevate what is base in it. For no kind of real wisdom can be either antagonistic or supplementary to wisdom itself; and it is out of an instinctive sense to this effect, that the epithet “worldly” always implies something of a corruption of wisdom, and therefore something not truly and finally wise. But the author has touched upon this point in stanza 37; and he feared to be too long, as well as to pay too little compliment to the discernment of his readers. ARGUMENT. Wisdom, upon his wondrous stage, Doth shewe his scenes to youth; Which Worldly Wisdom, fault-finding Stirreth to further truth. I A faire old house, less statelie than serene, Nigh to a towne, yet deepe within a glade, And looking on a lawne of gladsome greene, Whence crept a path to manie a thoughtful shade, Wisdom whilere his gentle dwelling made. A little brooke, neare beehives not a few, Glimmer'd in front; beside whose streame there play'd Children, the which it pleas'd him much to view; And bright, the streame beyond, a beauteous garden grew. II There ofte, at breake of day, be seene he might, Drawing sweet balsams from the bitterest flowers; Or, at his doore, by the starres' booke at night, Reading of endlesse, angell-wingèd houres; For he held converse with celestiall powers, From which he sole true name of wizard bore; And among other giftes and goodly dowers, Sights could he shewe, most faire, to aide his lore, And also sights most uglie, for to urge it more. III What, weigh'd with him, were wizards every one, So call'd, but fooles, tricking and trick'd withal? As Merlin, he that was a devil's son, Yet in a trap set by his dame did fall; Or that same slaine Maugis, faulse cardinall; Or Faustus, selling to the sire of lies His worthlesse selfe, whence neither gain'd at all. Wizard is wiseard; and the onlie wise Is he, whose setting sun is heavenlie as its rise. IV And who such lore could teache as Wisdom's selfe? Therefore did Heaven itselfe, from all he sawe, And all he found in knowledge on his shelfe, Give him unearthlie power sights forth to drawe Of spirituall thinges, bound to obey no lawe Of like compulsion, or be seene of eyes, Save theirs whom he would grace, or would adawe, With beauteous cherishment, or dread surprise: And ever they came soft, and swiftlie, servant-wise. V His house's largest roome, as was his wont, Making kinde schoole for youthes of budding age, He, with these sights and shewes therein, would daunt Their hastie wills, and reverent thoughts engage, Setting all forth upon a very stage: For much the stage he lov'd, and wise theàtre, Counting it as a church, in which the page Of vertuous verse found the sole dispensator, That could, with doubling force, make auditor spectator. VI At lessons thus high taught in sagest schoole, Smiling approofe as each before him rose, A would-be sib, who secretly its rule Deem'd fond, and for small tricks took those great shewes, (His name was Worldly Wisdom) one day chose To sit; and though as in approofe he sat, 'Twas in such sort as one that inly knowes More than he heares; and though commending that, Hath something still in store, to raise a caveat. VII The chosen youthes, who that day sat athirst For new shewes promis'd them on Wisdom's stage, Were such as nighed unto the time, when first They left, to seeke the worlde, his safer page, And felt their bloods warming to kindlie rage For all that manlie was, and good, and faire. Alas! too truly fitted to assuage That thirst the shewes were found, for sad they were; The more for seeming glad, when first they came from aire. VIII From aire they came, soft sliding, without pace, And unto musick fitting each in tone; And as they, one by one, stood fix'd in place, Voices of friends invisible made known Their names with zeale, in which much love was shewn, With great avisement of their vertues rare. The names were faulse, and not the names alone, Ne faulser than their fronts and faces were; And foule was all their substance, as their seeming faire, IX The first was Honesty, a chapman plaine, With manlie cheare, half smiling and half stayed, To shewe that he one measure for his gaine And one for equall dealing kept in trade. His clothing stout had all for use been made; Which to keepe cleane, and make it last the more, O'er all his front an apron he had laid; And in his heavie hand from Chepe he bore A cornucopia long, whose mouth shewed piled up store. X Awhile he stood, as making gentle suit For custom, which the youthfull gazers all Had fain accorded, so faire look'd his fruit, So closely pack'd, and mark'd at price so small, And he himself fellow so good withal: And scarce could they forbeare to cry aloud, And call him to them as from publicke stall; Till recollecting he was shewe avowed Of magic crafte, they whist, and still'd their joyous crowd. XI With loutings then, and visage still in view, Like to a player's congee on the stage, He backward stepp'd, as one his path that knew, And so would finish: but the wizard sage Sternly him stopp'd, like a right archimage, And bade him in his going turne about: On which the man, with looks at first of rage, Then of remonstrance, then refusal stout, Then fear and abject reverence, turn'd him to go out. XII But what a change was then! and how the back Belied the front of that same chapman plaine! For it was all one rotten pedlar's pack, On which there swarm'd in heapes grubs close as grain; And like a Janus he had faces twain, Of which the hindmost was a beetle's face Made bigger, such as rolleth dirt with pain; Whiles up to that same cornucopia's grace Of shewe in front, there ran one vile long hollow place. XIII Then voices very different from those first That prais'd the man, and gave him noble name, Cried out “Dishonesty!” and him accurst As one that pill'd the poore, and did great shame Unto true Honesty, and wrongfull blame; And all those youthes, the which had put their trust In his full horne, and long'd to buy the same Not more for feast, than joy in one so just, Felt scorne and shame, and bann'd his loathly trunk and bust. XIV He went; and in his place presented was One, in those youthes that seem'd to take great pride, And by those first fond tongues, as with true cause, By name of Just Laudation was outcried With lusty loudness, that dissent defied. A doctor's gowne he wore, his right that showed To judge in schooles, and speake of scholars tried; And ever as he came, his visage glowed With greeting so entranced, as worldes of praise bestowed. XV Not olde he was, ne was his gowne in sooth Much overnewe, but somewhat bare of thread; Which yet he wore, as one that cared for truth Much more than treasure, ne would fain be fed With feast, provided he got noble bread Out of the sweat of a free-judging brow, Which look'd unto deedes done, not sayings sed; And then he spoke, and owned he knew not how To call halfe-knowledge whole, ne unto halfe-worth bow. XVI “Therefore,” he sed, “he prais'd their teacher sage, And eke the sires that sought a guide so rare To save the leaders of th' ensuing age From erring into byewayes seeming faire, Which were but swamp, and sandiland, and snare; Ne should the height of some of those great sires, Much less their wealth, or here and there an heir Worthy their worth, stay laud that truth requires: Wealth were a curse indeed, that marr'd such just desires.” XVII The youthes, and those same heirs in speciall, Albeit they but late a sight had seene, Which warn'd them how they fell againe in thrall Of a first view of what might double been, Fell not in thrall alone, but transport clean With all which Just Laudation had them told. They roar'd; they ramp'd, they glorified I ween, Their foolish selves thrice over in their bold Praise of his praise, untill they shamed their teacher old. XVIII Who now in ire (if sage in ire could be) Cried to that maddener of his boyish rout, “Begone, base trier of my masterie, And in thy going turne thy lie about, And shewe them what, for every senseless shout Will make them wish they had been shorn of ears.” The liar turn'd; and they, withouten doubt, Wish'd themselves neither hearers then, ne seers, Ne dared a glance aside at their like blushing peers. XIX For lo! this shape, like to the former shape, Was double-visaged; and the face in view Was all a masse of mockery and jape, With tongue out-lolling, winking eyes askew, And filthy slaver, of toad-eating hue; And all the while, as it would ever dine, And hugg'd itself on thoughts of dishes new, It patted, betwixt grunt and fondling whine, Stomach, which still to feast it sought occasion fine. XX And “Parasite!” exclaim'd those tongues of truth, The wiles the falshood took his twofold way. Ne hiss, ne breath, was heard from all those youth, Such load of shame upon their spirits lay, And sense of future biting of that day: Till taking pity in his secret thought On that so plaine remorse which did them fray, The gentle wizard straight before them brought The third of those strange shapes which so their looking sought. XXI Which so their looking sought, but this the most, And most obtain'd, and sweetest seem'd to eyes, Ne one feare brought of what those two had cost To their misjudging haste with dread surprise, Which bade them henceforth trust no outward guise: For this a damsel was, and seem'd a may, So made of all that maketh ecstasies, That when her unseen ushers Love did say, Her look at once bore memory, sense, and soul away. XXII A loose light vest of blue she wore, with hood O'er half her locks; and with a lavish glee She shook from out its sleeves, as in a flood, Heaps of red roses, which the lovely she Then danced among with joyous impulse free: And then she stood, and as in some sweet want Of friend to finish her felicity, Warbled a song, learnt where the Sirens haunt, Of “Hither, love, oh hither! Let no feare thee daunt.” XXIII Up sprang the youthes, and would have rent the roofe With raptures fiercer far than all before, Had not the sire, with swifter shrill reproofe, Cried out, and turn'd the halfe-born stifled roar Into a sound far liker that of yore, When its last groan the brazen bull out-gave For what its human, burning bowels bore; For now was seen a sight, that nearly drave Youth's life-delighted selfe to wish itselfe in grave. XXIV The Love was turn'd; its hood, and more, gone clean, Shewing that second face, which in those two Vile shapes before had so detested been; But more detested far was now the view; For whereas those, being mockeries, almost knew Some touch of comic, this was tragic all, Nay, sadder still for want of sadness due, Being stone-hard, like face cut forth in wall, And more indifferent-eyed than mute at funerall. XXV Nathless both sad and sick, though hard 'twas, Als anger'd, though corpse-cold, and seeming dead. Pale snakes, entwined with strings of coin, alas! Writhed foul, though little felt, about its head; And for the ghastlier anti-life, instead Of back, and substance, and where heart should be, The trunk, like to a tray disfurnishéd, Was front alone, and hollow now to see, Like trunk of dread Elle-Maiden, haunting Germany. XXVI “Detestable, and miserable, and faulse!” The Master cried,—“Go,—into nothing go.” And like to shadowes fading upon walles, But with a gesture faint of mop and mow At what might have seem'd comfort worded so, The shape sank backward, gaping death-bed-wise. The youthes dumb-stricken sate, slain of that showe In pride and courage, ne scarce lifted eyes, Ne breath'd, save when as thought took sad reliefe in sighs. XXVII What first was Love, was now call'd Loathednesse, Though unto some it was known of neither name; And some confused it with a Piteousnesse By heartlesse men brought into heart-felt shame, And forced to beare its owne and others' blame: But these be riddles needing not recall Into such thoughts as here avisement claim: In good sad time youth will be taught them all; May Wisdom give them then his knowledge integrall. XXVIII As right reproofes least look'd for, latest given, And follow'd by no theme of alien force, Best take and best keepe root in conscience riven, And in and in still bite with sweet remorse, Wisdom would fain have left his shewes that course, But that his namesake, Worldy Wisdom hight, With voice once softe and sleke, now vinous hoarse, Broke forth, whenas was finish'd that third sight, In wordes heavy at heart, though seeming gay and light. XXIX “Behold!” he cried: “see, see! here see, good youths, In these plaine shewes, the good of great plaine speaking: Here Wisdom hath indeed told wisdom-truths, Here whineth not in wordes pining and peaking, Well wotting such be gullery all, and gleeking. Lo, Honesty! what is it? false pretences: Lo, Praise of others! what is that? self-seeking: Lo, Love desired! what but the honest senses? When done with, what but emptinesse and worse offences? XXX “Certes of arts a master great is here: High proofes he bringeth of his wondrous skill, And his quick servants causeth to appeare Quaint monitors 'gainst honeysops that still Must tice poore youth, and turne to bitter pill. Nathless, methinks, in these his goodly meanes To bless his youthes, and mould them to his will, And make them saints and angells in their teens, Something is miss'd, 'twixt true and false that intervenes. XXXI “Truth, as men say, is gold; and true it is; And gold, as eke 'tis said, needeth alloy For a great sake; to wit, expediency's; Else 'tis so hard, it worketh much annoy, And hindereth commerce all, and social joy. Therefore a wisdom beyond Wisdom's self, To wit, beyond his letter, simple and coy, Ordainèd hath, despite of ghost and elf, His book at such nice times should be laid up on shelf. XXXII “For, maugre these his makings of dread faces, Faces we all must make, in sense and reason; To say not so, were to beat all gimaces: For who one face to loyalty and treason, To court and mob, or in and out of season, Like to a very vice could keepe in screw, And not make true men yearn to twist his weason? No cheat am I; yet I, not only two, But twenty faces have, and none unfit to view.” XXXIII Ah, luckless wordes! and luckless wight! for lo! By some new cunning of great Wisdom's art Poor Worldly Wisdom by some sudden blow Was sent about, and with the hinder part Of his owne head made all the gazers start: They shudder'd! then laugh'd out; and evermore Laugh'd and laugh'd on, each from his very heart, Untill their breaths grew scant, and sides grew sore, And all the room seem'd rolling in the huge uproar. XXXIV For the poore wretch was nothing but a dish With a mouth over it, and two blind eyes; In sensual living had been all his wish, And this was all was left him of his prize. He saw not heart, ne hope, ne fields, ne skies, Ne lov'd or tasted aught, except his dinner, And that with tooth grown dull. He held it lies To say that old age ever was a winner Of any least thing else. God pity him a sinner! XXXV In that last thought, through Wisdom's gentle moving, Fell, and so died, the stormy merriment, The whiles, as if at their late scorn's reproving, The small mean vision wither'd up and went, Like one to nothingness by nature bent, Soon as the laugh was not upon his side. “Well worth your scorn and scoff was his intent To make believe, my children,” Wisdom cried, “That because faulse is faulse, all truth is nullified. XXXVI “All those faire fronts ye sawe were masks alone Whate'er they seem'd, or still may daily seeme 'Twixt man and man in fleshly vision shewne; For wheresoe'er cometh deceit extreme, Cometh of what it looks nought but the dreame, And only the Soul's Face, which ay is hid Save by the single-minded, dares forth beame In one sole front. Those which to turn I bid, Were all Soul's Faces, forc'd to shewe them as they did. XXXVII “Thus I but warn'd of falsehood; bid ye guard 'Gainst foolish deeming all that glistens gold; But not the lesse its fierie trial hard The true ore stands, when melts the baser mould. No: nor the lesse, as the sage did of old, May true men buy and sell, and sager shine For knowing gain's good uses manifold. Praiser of youth was Socrates divine; But blaming too when wrong, gave praise its value fine. XXXVIII “And Love?—What wise man knoweth not how true And single-faced loveliest true love can be? How sure to meete the face it answereth to, In mirth with smiles, smiling how totally! In griefe with teares, soothing how helpfully! For surest of sure thinges is helpe in love. But now your eyes shall learne, and grieve not.—See! Beholde, for sample, one faire household dove, One of our England's angells, not yet call'd above.” XXXIX While thus he spoke, lo! Wisdom's stage became A plot of grass within a bowery nook, In which, as though she round her felt the same, There walk'd a youthfull ladie with a book, Loving now that, now bird, now bud, now brook, The more for what in the sweete page she red, As you might guesse by her referring look. “'Tis Sidney's sister,” Wisdom softly sed:— “With brother's love begins the love that well shall spred. XL “With brother's love, and love of parents good, And love of all that with celestiall aire Fills home, begins the love that is endued With gifts to make another's home as faire. There seek ye your Sirens; finde your first loves there, And earne them soone, and love them first and last. There only, or with grief-taught sweetnesse rare, Shapes will ye finde, in whose one mould are cast Fair Seeming and True Being, bound in substance fast. XLI “See, in her bower waiteth a spinning-wheele, And, 'tis a herbal nigheth the guitar. She studieth to clothe the poor, and heale, And blithely then singeth, as though her star Shone on a worlde of peace without a jar; Grave looks in her are sweete as gay in others, And gay in her true as their gravest are: Hence flowereth she, pride of the flower of brothers, Hence will be pride and flower of dearest wives and mothers.” XLII Here the sweete ladie, turning as he spoke, Her gentle steps in walking to retrace, Oh! what a transport in the youthes awoke, Simply at witnessing no second face! They waited not to note the shape and grace; They lov'd the very falling of her haire; Nay, deem'd its ribbon of celestiall race. Her coming had been all that was most faire; Her going beat all comings, angells' though they were. XLIII No shout ensued; no noise; nought save a murmur Of their entrancèd souls, each unto each; None needed more their faith in love made firmer; Here fairest faire was found without impeach; Here an earth-heaven, which if they might not reach (So high a star in place was Sidney's sister), Nathless of heaven the like they might beseech: Therefore, in thought, each with deare worship kiss'd her, When, as in cruell dreame, lo! suddenlie they miss'd her. XLIV Miss'd her; for now as suddenlie there rose The deepe church-organ's gently-gathering might, With which the sage was duly wont to close Teachings, harmonious with good and right. Rose then his schoole, and parted for the night Each to his thoughts, sweete as those notes, and strong; And as they went, the great heaven-opening sight Of th' order-keeping stars, never yet wrong, Shewed to what great sweete ends all firme good thoughts belong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Political and Critical Poems. POLITICS AND POETICS. OR, THE DESPERATE SITUATION OF A JOURNALIST UNHAPPILY SMITTEN WITH THE LOVE OF RHYME. (WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1810.) Again I stop;—again the toil refuse! Away, for pity's sake, distracting Muse, Nor thus come smiling with thy bridal tricks Between my studious face and politics. Is it for thee to mock the frowns of fate? Look round, look round, and mark my desperate state. Cannot thy gifted eyes a sight behold, That might have quell'd the Lesbian bard of old, And made the blood of Dante's self run cold? Lo, first the table spread with fearful books, In which, whoe'er can help it, never looks; Letters to Lords, Remarks, Reflections, Hints, Lives snatch'd a moment from the public prints; Pamphlets to prove, on pain of our undoing, That rags are wealth, and reformation ruin, Journals, and briefs, and bills, and laws of libel, And, bloated and blood-red, the placeman's annual bible. Scarce from the load, as from a heap of dead, My poor old Homer shows his living head; Milton, in sullen darkness, yields to fate, And Tasso groans beneath the courtly weight; Horace alone (the rogue!) his doom has miss'd, And lies at ease upon the Pension List. Round these, in tall imaginary chairs, Imps ever grinning, sit my daily Cares; Distaste, delays, dislikings to begin, Gnawings of pen, and kneadings of the chin. Here the Blue Dæmon keeps his constant stir, Who makes a man his own barometer; There Nightmare, horrid mass! unfeatured heap! Prepares to seize me if I fall asleep; And there, with hands that grasp one's very soul, Frowns Headache, scalper of the studious poll; Headache, who lurks at noon about the courts, And whets his tomahawk on East's Reports. Chief of this social game, behind me stands, Pale, peevish, periwigg'd, with itching hands, A goblin, double-tail'd, and cloak'd in black, Who, while I'm gravely thinking, bites my back. Around his head flits many a harpy shape, With jaws of parchment, and long hairs of tape, Threatening to pounce, and turn whate'er I write, With their own venom, into foul despite. Let me but name the court, they swear and curse And din me with hard names; and what is worse 'Tis now three times that I have miss'd my purse. No wonder poor Torquato went distracted, On whose gall'd senses just such pranks were acted; When the small tyrant, God knows on what ground, With dungeons and with doctors hemm'd him round. Last, but not least, (methinks I see him now!) With stare expectant, and a ragged brow, Comes the foul fiend, who—let it rain or shine, Let it be clear or cloudy, foul or fine, Or freezing, thawing, drizzling, hailing, snowing, Or mild, or warm, or hot, or bleak and blowing, Or damp, or dry, or dull, or sharp, or sloppy, Is sure to come,—the Devil, who comes for copy, Yet see! e'en now thy wondrous charm prevails; The shapes are moved, the stricken circle fails; With backward grins of malice they retire, Scared at thy seraph looks and smiles of fire. That instant, as the hindmost shuts the door, The bursting sunshine smites the window'd floor; Bursts too on every side the sparkling sound Of birds abroad; th' elastic spirits bound; And the fresh mirth of morning breathes around. Away, ye clouds; dull politics, give place; Off cares, and wants, and threats, and all the race Of foes to freedom and to graceful leisure!— To-day is for the Muse, and dancing pleasure. Oh for a seat in some poetic nook, Just hid with trees, and sparkling with a brook, Where through the quivering boughs the sunbeams shoot Their arrowy diamonds upon flower and fruit, While stealing airs come whispering o'er the stream, And lull the fancy to a waking dream! There shouldst thou come, O first of my desires, What time the noon had spent its fiercer fires, And all the bow'r, with checker'd shadows strewn, Glow'd with a mellow twilight of its own. There shouldst thou come, and there sometimes with thee Might deign repair the staid Philosophy, To taste thy fresh'ning brook, and trim thy groves, And tell us what good task true glory loves. I see it now!—I pierce the fairy glade, And feel th' enclosing influence of the shade. A thousand forms, that sport on summer eves, Glance through the light, and whisper in the leaves, While every bough seems nodding with a sprite, And every air seems hushing the delight, And the calm bliss, fix'd on itself awhile, Dimples th' unconscious lips into a smile. In vain.—For now, with looks that doubly burn, Shamed of their late defect my foes return; They know their foil is short, and shorter still The bliss that waits upon the Muse's will. Back to their seats they rush, and reassume Their ghastly rites, and sadden all the room. O'er ears and brain the bursting wrath descends, Cabals, misstatements, noise of private ends, Doubts, hazards, crosses, cloud-compelling vapours, With dire necessity to read the papers, Judicial slaps that would have stung Saint Paul, Costs, pityings, warnings, wits; and worse than all (Oh for a dose of Thelwall or of poppy) The fiend, the punctual fiend, that bawls for copy! Full in the midst, like that Gorgonian spell, Whose ravening features glar'd collected hell, The well-wigg'd pest his curling horror shakes, And a fourth snap of threatening vengeance takes! At that dread sight the Muse herself turns pale; Freedom and fiction's self no more avail; And lo! my Bower of Bliss is turned into a jail! What then? What then my better genius cries:— Scandals and jails! All these you may despise. Th' enduring soul, that, to keep others free, Dares to give up its darling liberty, Lives wheresoe'er its countrymen applaud, And in their great enlargement walks abroad. But toils alone, and struggles hour by hour, Against th' insatiate, gold-flush'd Lust of Power, Can keep the fainting virtue of thy land From the rank slaves that gather round his hand. Be poor in purse, and Law will soon undo thee; Be poor in soul, and self-contempt will rue thee. I yield, I yield.—Once more I turn to you, Harsh politics! and once more bid adieu To the soft dreaming of the Muse's bowers, Their sun-streak'd fruits and fairy-painted flowers; Farewell for gentler times, ye laurell'd shades; Farewell, ye sparkling brooks and haunted glades, Where the trim shapes that bathe in moonlight eves, Glance through the light and whisper in the leaves, While every bough seems nodding with a sprite, And every air seems hushing the delight. Farewell, farewell, dear Muse, and all thy pleasure. He conquers ease, who would be crown'd with leisure! THE FEAST OF THE POETS. 1811. T'other day, as Apollo sat pitching his darts Through the clouds of November by fits and by starts, He began to consider how long it had been Since the bards of Old England a session had seen. “I think,” said the God recollecting (and then He fell twiddling a sunbeam, as I may my pen) “I think—let me see—yes, it was, I declare, As far back as the time of that Buckingham there: And yet I can't see why I've been so remiss, Unless it may be,—and it certainly is,— That since Dryden's fine verses, and Milton's sublime, I have fairly been sick of their sing-song and rhyme. There was Collins, 'tis true, had a good deal to say, But the dog had no industry, neither had Gray. And Thomson, though dear to my heart, was too florid To make the world see that their own taste was horrid. So ever since Pope, my pet bard of the town, Set a tune with his verses half up and half down, There has been such a doling and sameness,—by Jove, I'd as soon have gone down to see Kemble in love. However, of late as they've rous'd them anew, I'll e'en go and give them a lesson or two; And as nothing in England is done without eating, See what kind of set I can muster, worth treating. So saying, the God bade his horses walk for'ard, And leaving them, took a long drive to the nor'ard: Then made for Mivart's; and as Gods who drop in do, Came still as his beams through a drawing-room window. And here I could tell, were I given to spin it, How all the town shook, as the godhead came in it; How bright look'd the poets, and brisk blew the airs, And the laurels shot up in the gardens and squares: But fancies like these, though I've stores to supply me, I'd better keep back for a poem I've by me, And merely observe that the girls look'd divine, And the old folks in-doors exclaim'd, “Bless us, how fine!” If you'd fancy, however, what Phœbus might be, Imagine a shape above mortal degree, Compounded of ardency, dignity, grace, All fire, yet all self-possession; with face That show'd him at once the true offspring of Jove, The brow full of wisdom, and lips full of love; For though he was beardless, and blooming of cheek, And had deign'd in his dress to be classic and Greek, Yet his look with a reach far remoter was wise, And the soul of eternity thought through his eyes. I wouldn't say more, lest my climax should lose; Yet now I have mention'd these lamps of the muse, I can't but observe what a splendour they shed, When a warmth more than common enforc'd what he said: Then the light which before flash'd in glimpse and in glance, Seem'd to gather more substance, and burn in advance; And if, as he shook back his hair in its cluster, A curl fell athwart them and darken'd their lustre, A sprinkle of gold through the duskiness came, Like the sun through a tree, when he's setting in flame The God then no sooner had taken a chair, And rung for the landlord to order the fare, Than he heard a strange noise, and a knock from without, And scraping and bowing came in such a rout! There were all the worst playwrights from Dibdin to Terry, All grinning, as who should say, “Shan't we be merry?” With men of light comedy lumb'ring like bears up, And men of deep tragedy patting their hairs up. The God for an instant sat fix'd as a stone, Till recovering, he said in a good-natur'd tone, “Oh, the waiters, I see:—ah, it's all very well; Only one of you'll do, just to answer the bell.” But Lord! to see all the great dramatists' faces! They look'd at each other, and made such grimaces! Then turning about, left the room in vexation:— Their faces said plainly, “Well, this is damnation!” The God fell a-laughing to see his mistake, But stopp'd with a sigh for the poor drama's sake; Then gave mine host orders, who bow'd to the floor, And had scarcely back'd out, and shut gently the door, When a hemming was heard, consequential and snapping, And a sour little gentleman walk'd with a rap in. He bow'd, look'd about him, seem'd cold, and sat down, And said, “I'm surpris'd that you'll visit this town: To be sure, there are one or two of us who know you, But as to the rest, they are all much below you. So stupid in gen'ral the natives are grown, They really prefer Scotch reviews to their own, So what with their taste, their reformers, and stuff, They have sicken'd myself and my friends long enough.” “Yourself and your friends!” cried the God in high glee; “And pray, my frank visitor, who may you be?” “Who be!” said the other;—“why really—this tone— William Gifford's a name, I think, pretty well known.” “Oh, now I remember,” said Phœbus:—“oh, true: The Anti-La-Cruscan that writes the review:— The rod, though 'twas no such vast matter, that fell On that plague of the butterflies, did very well; And there's something which even distaste must respect In the self-taught example that conquer'd neglect: But not to insist on the recommendations Of modesty, wit, and a small stock of patience, My visit just now is to poets alone, And not to small critics, however well known.” So saying, he rang, to leave nothing in doubt, And the sour little gentleman bless'd himself out. But now came the men of right visiting claims; I forget in what order, but here are the names. There was Campbell, for Hope and fine war-songs renown'd, With a wail underneath them of tenderer sound; And Rogers, who follow'd, as Memory should; And Scott, full of Scotland's old minstrelling mood (The God overwhelm'd him with thanks for his novels) Then Crabbe, asking questions concerning Greek hovels; And Byron, with eager indifference; and Moore, With admiring glad eyes that came leaping before; And Southey, with dust from the books on his shelf; And Wordsworth, whose porcelain was taken for delf, And Coleridge, whose poetry's poetry's self. “And now,” said the God,—but he scarcely had spoken, But bang went the door—you'd have thought it was broken: And in rush'd a mob with a scuffle and squeeze, Exclaiming, “What! Coleridge, and fellows like these! Nay then, we may all take our seats as we please.” I can't, if I would, tell you who they all were, But a whole shoal of fops and of pedants were there, All the heart and impart men, and such as suppose They write like the Virgils, and Popes, and Boileaus. The God smiled at first, with a turn tow'rd the fire, And whisper'd, “There, tell 'em they'd better retire:” But Lord! this was only to set all their quills up; The rogues did but bustle, and pulling their frills up, Stood fixing their faces, and stirr'd not an inch; Nay, some took their snuff out, and join'd in a pinch. Then wrath seiz'd Apollo; and turning again, “Ye rabble,” he cried, “common-minded and vain, Whate'er be the faults which true bards may commit (And most of them lie in your own want of wit), Ye shall try, wretched creatures, how well ye can bear, What such only witness, unsmote with despair.” He said; and the place all seem'd swelling with light, While his locks and his visage grew awfully bright; And clouds, burning inward, roll'd round on each side, To encircle his state, as he stood in his pride; Till at last the full Deity put on his rays, And burst on the sight in the pomp of his blaze: Then a glory beam'd round as of fiery rods, Mid wraths of loud organs and chorister gods; And faces of terrors celestial, that brought Overwhelming compulsions and burdens of thought. Yea, pleasures of heav'n turn'd horriblest pains, And all which demands from potentiallest brains Long reverent approach to the outermost bounds Of a Presence Divine, whom its glory surrounds. That sight and those terrors might not be sustain'd But by such as in wonder's great school had been train'd; And even the bards who had graciousness found, After gazing a while, bow'd them down to the ground. What then could remain for that feeble-soul'd crew? Through the door in an instant they rush'd and they flew; They rush'd, and they dash'd, and they scrambled and stumbled, And down the hall-staircase distractedly tumbled, And never once thought which was head or was feet, And slid through the hall, and fell plump in the street. So great was the panic they struck with their flight, That of all who had come to be feasted that night, Not one ventured back, or would stay near the place: Even Ireland declined, notwithstanding his face. But Phœbus no sooner had gain'd his good ends, Than he put off his terrors, and rais'd up his friends, Who stood for a moment entranced to behold The glories subside, and the dim-rolling gold, And listen'd to sounds, that with ecstasy burning Seem'd dying far upward, like heaven returning. Then “Come,” cried the God, who resumed and restored All the ease that could bless mortal guests at his board, “Let us wake with the lips that we dip in our bowls Earth's best bit of heaven—congenial souls.” So saying, he led through the door without state, Each bard, as he follow'd him, blessing his fate; And by some charm or other, as each took his chair, There burst a most beautiful wreath in his hair. I can't tell 'em all, but the groundwork was bay; And Campbell, in his, had some oak-leaves and may; And Southey a palm-branch, and Moore had a vine, And pepper-leaf Byron, surmounted with pine; And mountain-ash Wordsworth, with groundsel and yew; And Coleridge the rare petals four, that endue Their finder with magic; and, lovely to tell, They sparkled with drops from Apollo's own well. Then Apollo put his on, that sparkled with beams, And rich rose the feast as an epicure's dreams; Not epicure civic, or grossly inclined, But such as a poet might dream ere he dined: For the God had no sooner determin'd the fare, Than it turn'd to whatever was racy and rare: The fish and the flesh, for example, were done, On account of their fineness, in flame from the sun; The wines were all nectar of different smack, To which Muscat was nothing, nor Virginis Lac, No, nor even Johannisberg, soul of the Rhine, Nor Montepulciano, though king of all wine. Then, as for the fruits, you might garden for ages, Before you could raise me such apples and gages; And all on the table no sooner were spread, Than their cheeks next the God blushed a beautiful red. 'Twas magic in short, and deliciousness all; The very men-servants grew handsome and tall; To velvet-hung ivory the furniture turn'd, The service with opal and adamant burn'd; Each candlestick changed to a pillar of gold, While a bundle of beams took the place of the mould. The decanters and glasses pure diamond became, And the corkscrew ran solidly round into flame;— In a word, so completely forestall'd were the wishes, E'en harmony struck from the noise of the dishes. It can't be suppos'd I should think of repeating The fancies that flow'd at this laureat meeting: I haven't the brains; and besides, wasn't there, But the wit may be easily guess'd by the chair. I must mention, however, that during the wine, Our four greatest poets were toasted with nine: Then others with six or with three as it fitted; Nor were those who translate with a gusto, omitted. On this, Southey begging the Deity's ear,— “I know,” interrupted Apollo, “'tis Frere:” And Walter look'd up too, and begged to propose— “No, no,” answer'd Phœbus, “I cannot add Rose; Yet I love the man too;—here's a health to his prose.” Then talking of lyrics, he call'd upon Moore, Who sang such a song that they shouted “Encore!” And the God was so pleas'd with his taste and his tone, He obey'd the next call, and gave one of his own,— At which you'd have thought—'twas so witching a warble, The guests had all turn'd into listening marble; The wreaths on their temples grew brightest of bloom, As the breath of the Deity circled the room, But the wine in the glasses went rippling in rounds, As if follow'd and fann'd by the soft-winged sounds. Thus chatting and singing they sat till eleven, When Phœbus shook hands, and departed for heaven; “For poets,” he said, “who would cherish their powers And hope to be deathless, must keep to good hours.” So off he betook him, their eyes looking forth As like a long meteor he shot up the north; For the Bear was his inn; and the Comet, they say, Was his tandem in waiting to fetch him away. POSTSCRIPT. 'Twas in eighteen eleven those bards came to dine: I now add a word in eighteen fifty-nine. For divers times more did those nine laurell'd brothers Receive invitations to dine with new others. As Thurlow, to wit, with his old poet-strain, Whose crotchets that way hurt a really fine vein; And Keats, the God's own young historian of Gods; With Shelley, diviner still, planning abodes For earth to enjoy with surpassers of Plato; And Landor, whom two Latin poets sent bay to (Catullus and Ovid); with Procter, whose songs Have made such sweet air of life's raptures and wrongs, Besides setting free the true tongue of the stage For Landor to join in full many a page, And Shelley at Rome with so lofty a rage. Tom Hood too was feasted, strange glad and sad brain, Whose mirth, you may notice, turns all upon pain. His puns are such breeders of puns, in and in, Our laughter becomes a like manifold din: Yet a right poet also was Hood, and could vary His jokes with deep fancies of Centaur and Fairy; And aye on his fame will a tear be attending, Who wrote the starv'd song, with its burden unending. Now finish, my song, with one visitor more; The good old boy's face—how it bloom'd at the door! Hazlitt, painting it during its childhood, turn'd grim, Saying, “D?n your fat cheeks!” then out louder, “Frown, Jim.” Those cheeks still adorn'd the most natural of souls, Whose style yet was not so—James Sheridan Knowles. His style had been taught him in those his green days; His soul was his own, and brought crowds to his plays. Since then, many poets of new generations Have doubtless receiv'd like divine invitations; But where's the rash youth for their specifications? BLUE-STOCKING REVELS; OR, THE FEAST OF THE VIOLETS. (1837.) CANTO I. Showing what sort of rebuke Apollo gave his nymphs, and how gods furnish houses. Lo! I, who in verse flowing smooth as the wine (“Modest youth!”) once recorded a dinner divine, And show'd the great god of the sun entertaining With wit and crack'd walnuts the poets then reigning; Now sing, in a dance fitter still for the crupper Whose wings bore me thither a more divine supper; For that was of man, though of Phœbus; but this is Of Phœbus, and woman, and blue-stocking blisses. The god, you must know then, like other bright souls, Attends not to ev'ry dull curfew that tolls, But often pays visits at night-time, and sits Conversing till morning with beauties and wits In guise of some talker renown'd,—my Carlyle, Jeffrey, Coleridge, or Wilson;—joy listens the while;— And in case he's too late for Aurora, they say, Some proxy, I know not who, brings up the day; Which is likely;—for after a night such as that, The day, you may notice, is terribly flat. Well; the eve of last May-day, his work being done, Apollo sat playing his lute in the sun, As backward his car in the deep began sinking; And round it the Water-Nymphs, with their eyes winking, Plash'd, patting the horses, and loos'ning the reins, While the lute through the lustre sent flooding its strains, When lo! he saw coming towards him, in pairs, Such doves of Petitions, and loves of sweet Pray'rs, All landing, as each touch'd his chariot, in sighs, And begging his aid in behalf of bright eyes, That it made him look sharper, to see whence they came:— The windows on earth, at the flash of that aim, Burst suddenly all into diamonds and flame. “By Jove!” said Apollo, “well thought on.—I've dined With the Poets:—'tis now highly proper, I find, To descend (and with finger-tips here he fell trimming His love-locks celestial) and sup with the Women.” He said; and some messages giving those daughters Of Ocean,—arch-eyed,—buxom dancers in waters,— They gave him some answer (I never heard what) Which they paid for, i'faith, with a dance on the spot; For shaking his locks, and a pleasant frown casting, He thrust his car back with his foot everlasting, And sprang up in air with a bound so divine, As sous'd their sweet souls in the roar of the brine. Then laughing the laugh of the gods, he rose higher, And higher, and higher, on the whirl of his fire, Lark mighty; till choosing his road, like the dove Which bears at its warm bosom letters of love, He shot, all at once, in a long trail of light, Like the star that comes liquidly through the soft night, And stood in a “House to Let,” facing Hyde Park, “Unfurnish'd;”—but not so, ye gods, before dark! O Seddon! O Gillow! O Mr. Morell! O Taprell and Holland! O Minter! O Snell! O ev'ry one else, dear to new-married spouses, Don't speak any more of your fitting up houses; Don't mention your Sèvres, your buhls, or-molus, And for ever henceforth have no customers, Hughes: Quench the light of your lustres, great Perry and Co.: Ye Bantings, be counted extremely so-so: Nay, hold your tongue, Robins; amaze us no longer In paragraphs, “coming it” stronger and stronger: Cease roaring in great A, and wheedling in small; And thou, even thou, greatest gusto of all, Tasteful shade of magnificent, house-warming Guelph, Turn about in thy tomb, and say, “Laid on the Shelf!” The house not an instant had felt the god's presence, When something—I know not what—but a quintessence Of fragrance and purity hallow'd the place, Some spirit of lilies, and crystal, and grace. His height he had stoop'd, as he entered the door, Tow'rds the human; but still his own costume he wore, Or at least a Greek vest; and be sure he wore bay; In short, was a kind of Apollo d'Orsay. Then gliding from room to room, like a slow bee, Half a foot from the floor, his lute went playing he, And the sound was a magical charm to invest Whatsoever he looked on with all he lik'd best; Nor indeed was it strange that his lute should do this, When Amphion, you know, built a city with his. Thus the ball-room, whose wainscot was stucco before, Rose in arches of flowers, midway from the floor, All dabbled with dew-drops, and stirr'd with a breath; While the rest (for no cold could give shoulders “their death,” Where Phœbus was present) was all a fair sight Of iv'ry, and cushions of silk, bridal white:— (More colours for these would flow in with the ball:) And betwixt the fair couches were services small Of ices, and creams, and clear jellies, smooth-soul'd, The very tip-ends of refreshment and cold. Then the drawing-room—What, think ye, hung the walls there? Cloth of gold? No, of sunbeams. 'Twas made of his hair. The immense window-curtains, Calypso's own woollen, Like clouds to the sunset, hung gorgeously sullen. But as to the supper-room! O thou Aladdin, Thy genii had found it a thing to go mad in; Such wealth (which yet somehow fell soft on the eyes) Branch'd it over with jewels of wonderful size, All carv'd into fruit, thick and leafy, and all Encrusting white marble, as vines do a wall. The fruit, colour's minions, like ecstasy shone; While the marble, most fair, and yet mellow of tone, Came cooling the warmth, the rich masses between; But the ceiling was one mighty sapphire serene, From the centre of which, and their stamens of gold, Lilies shed such a light, as 'twas peace to behold. And forth, from all sides, issued tap'stry and table, And sofa, with pictures of loveliest fable, And portraits, with eyes that seem'd happy to come, Of wits and sweet women; and every room Had music, unseen in it, waiting to play; A note now and then, would come chuckling away, As though with its rapture it vainly was striving;— And hark! the burst comes! the fair guests are arriving. But first, I must tell you who form'd the spectators;— Imprimis, the Poets, the happy Translators, The Wits, the Physicians (they say that the godhead To Knighton, Smith, Elliotson, specially nodded;) All Artists, all Archers (a bright blushing stare Put a bud in the cheeks of their green-gownèd fair;) The Musicians, the Singers (of course the chief only;) And lastly (for fear any heart should feel lonely, Although with a god,—and to crown it besides With the sweetest of glories, home-glory,) all prides Were consulted, of husbands, and friends, and relations, And lovers, and children.—Of all adorations Commend me to that, which enwrapt ev'ry feature In love tow'rds the god, for this household good-nature. “Well said!” cries the reader; “but stop, Mr. Poet;— The god's invitation—pray how could they know it? We hear of no message; no list had enroll'd 'em.” 'Tis true; 'twas not wanted; their Geniuses told 'em;— The Spirit that's born with us, but becomes visible Solely with those to such suppers admissible. Beauteous it was, to see each how he led His charge by the hand, with the flame on his head, She walking, he gliding. It gave her such grace, As made the crowd happy to look in her face (For never did crowd gather yet at a door so); The plain became handsome, the handsomest more so, If plain any face can be call'd that has eyes Such as almost all brain with its deep look supplies: The music ceas'd playing, as each was presented; And Silence, with sighs, 'twas so ultra-contented, Felt tears in the eyes of its rapture, to see How they kiss'd the god's hand, and their eyelids kiss'd he; And then, on each entrance, there pour'd forth again Some characteristic and exquisite strain, And thus came each charmer of verse, or of story, In a sort of sweet tempest of pleasure and glory. I tell not the dresses. Suffice it that Titian Had own'd himself conquer'd at this exhibition; So rich were the colours! such autumn! such May! For spirits and years made them more or less gay; And the elder in orange and russet came, queenly; The younger in lily and rose, sprinkled greenly: The buxom, uniting both tastes, fill'd the doors With their shoulders and frills, à la Louis Quatorze; Or with robes à l'antique, and with crowns from their graperies: Blest were the eyes that beheld their broad draperies! CANTO II. How the visitors were presented to Apollo, and what sort of a ball he gave them. Now as to the names (how much less then the natures, And writings, and beauties!) of all the dear creatures, I boast not to mention the whole of them;—nay, I live so sequester'd, so out of the way, That perhaps I don't know them,—perhaps shall omit Some bud of such promise, such sweet virgin wit, Or for want of due reading, shall fail in due notice Of some such delight of all earth's epiglottis, That when I am told what I've done, I shall tear From my head, in pure anguish, whole masses of hair: You will think it a barber's shop all round my chair, And yet, when I vow that I'll seize all occasion Of loading “the love” with my best reparation, My “startling,” “intense,” “truly new,” “soul-subduing,” And other fond truths of impartial reviewing, I fancy I hear her, in tones of caresses, Exclaim, “God preserve his dear elderly tresses!” Lo! first then (for not in stern order of fame, But in blest alphabetical order they came, Though she that first enter'd, well headed the dears) Mrs. Adams, rare mistress of thought and of tears; Then Aikin judicious;—discreet Mrs. Austin, Whose English her German you'll never find lost in;— And Madame d'Arblay, mighty grave all the while, Yet at heart smitten still betwixt fun and a style, And longing to tell us more ladies' distresses 'Twixt lords, and vulgarians, and debts for their dresses. So deep was her curtsey, the hoop that she wore Seem'd fairly conveying her right through the floor. But up she swam round, and Miss Baillie succeeded: No queen could have come with such pages as she did; For who, do you think, held her train up?—The Passions: They did indeed; all too in elegant fashions. The god in his arms with gay reverence lock'd her, For two sakes,—her own, and her brother's, the doctor. A young lady then, whom to miss were a caret In any verse-history, named, I think, Barrett, (I took her at first for a sister of Tennyson) Knelt, and receiv'd the god's kindliest benison. —“Truly,” said he, “dost thou share the blest power Poetic, the fragrance as well as the flower; The gift of conveying impressions unseen, And making the vaguest thoughts know what they mean.” “Lady Blessington!” cried the glad usher aloud, As she swam through the doorway, like moon from a cloud: I know not which most her face beam'd with,—fine creature! Enjoyment, or judgment, or wit, or good-nature. Perhaps you have known what it is to feel longings To pat silken shoulders at routs, and such throngings;— Well, think what it was at a vision like that! A Grace after dinner! A Venus grown fat! Some “Elderly Gentleman” risked an objection; But this only made us all swear her “perfection.” His arms the host threw round the liberal bodice, And kiss'd her, exactly as god might do goddess. Betham, Blackwood, Bowles, Bray, and Miss Browne, too, were there; What a sweet load of B's! But then what a despair! For I know not their writings. (I'm tearing my hair!) Cary Burney came next, so precise yet so trusting, Her heroines are perfect, and yet not disgusting. “However,” said Phœbus, “I can't quite approve them: Conceit follows close on the mere right to love them.” Then came Fanny Butler, perplex'd at her heart Betwixt passion and elegance, nature and art; The daughter of sense and of grace, yet made wroth With her own finer wit by o'er-straining at both. Phœbus smil'd on her parents, who stood there in sight, And quoted some lines from her play about “Night.” Marg'ret Cullen succeeded, whose novels one lives in, Like one of her hamlets, where talk never gives in; Dear, kind-hearted, arch-humour'd, home-loving dame; And to sum up all eulogy,—worthy her name. “You make me sleep sometimes,” quoth Phœbus, “'tis true; But I do even that, let me tell you, with few.” “Lady Dacre.”—'Twas pleasant to see the god raise, In honour of her and of Petrarch, his bays. “And how go your own winged horses?” quoth he: Then he asked after Margaret Gillies and Mee, Seyffarth, Carpenter, Robertson, Barrett, and Sharp, The Corbaux, the Chalons:—in short, more than his harp Has strings to outnumber, or haste can disclose; And look'd at the gall'ries, and smil'd as they rose: For they all sat together, in colours so rare They appear'd like a garden, enchanting the air; But what pleas'd me hugely, he call'd to my wife, And said, “You have done Shelley's mood to the life.” Some lady musicians completed the bower, At head of whom earnestly gaz'd Betsy Flower. At the sight of Miss Edgeworth, he said, “Here comes one, As sincere and as kind as lives under the sun; Not poetical, eh?—nor much giv'n to insist On utilities not in utility's list (Things, nevertheless, without which the large heart Of my world would but play a poor husk of a part), But most truly, within her own sphere, sympathetic, And that's no mean help tow'rds the practic-poetic.” Then, smiling, he said a most singular thing,— He thank'd her for making him “saving of string”!! But for fear she should fancy he didn't approve her in Matters more weighty, prais'd much her “Manœuvring;” A book, which if aught could pierce craniums so dense, Might supply cunning folks with a little good sense. And her Irish (he added) poor souls! so impressed him, He knew not if most they amus'd or distress'd him. No fault had Miss Ferrier to find with her lot; She was hail'd by the god as the “lauded of Scott.” “Mrs. Gore.” Phœbus open'd his arms, with a face, In the gladness of which was the coming embrace. “For her satire,” he said, “wasn't evil, a bit; But as full of good heart, as of spirits and wit; Only somewhat he found, now and then, which dilated A little too much on the fashions it rated, And heaps of ‘Polite Conversation’ so true, That he, once, really wish'd the three volumes were two; But not when she dwelt upon daughters or mothers; Oh, then the three made him quite long for three others; And poor ‘Mrs. Armytage,’ warning exaction, Sits arm-chair'd forever, a dread petrifaction. Then how much good reading! what fit flowing words! What enjoyment, whether midst houses or herds! 'Twas the thinking of men with the lightness of birds!” Never prais'd be prose-love in a style so poetic.— Then he kiss'd Mrs. Gillies by right sympathetic, And somebody smiling, and looking askance, He said, “Honi soit, my friend, qui mal y pense; What in gods is a right and confirms a good fame, Were in you a presumption. The same's not the same.” And with this profound speech, and a bow to the dame (Whom he thank'd for “Cleone,” and “Gentile and Jew,” And for other things far more didactic and blue, But advis'd for the future, to preach reformation With all of her sweets, and no exacerbation) He rais'd Mrs. Hall from her rev'rence profound, Saying, “Nonsense, my dear; clasp me honestly round:— For the gods love the pleasure you take, 'tis so hearty, In all sorts of characters, careless of party.” And now came Miss Hamilton. Phœbus presented A look to her curtsey so little contented, It seem'd less for poetess fit than for beldam! In fact, she provok'd him by writing so seldom. Mrs. Hoffland he tenderly welcom'd and styled “Good motherly soul;” and benignantly smiled On the close cap of Howitt. These Muse Quakeresses Are Noes (he said) turn'd to the sweetest of Yesses. Lo! Jameson accomplish'd; and Lamb, the fine brain, (News of Charles in Elysium brought balm to its pain;) And Landon, whose grief is so dulcet a treasure, We'd weep to oblige her, but can't for the pleasure. “Ah! welcome home, Martineau, turning statistics To stories, and puzzling your philogamystics! I own I can't see, any more than dame Nature, Why love should await dear good Harriet's dictature! But great is earth's want of some love-legislature. “And Mitford, all hail! with a head that for green From your glad village crowners can hardly be seen.” And with that he shone on it, and set us all blinking: And yet at her kind heart sat tragedy, thinking. Then Montagu,—Eleanora Louisa! Was ever name finer, 'twixt Naples and Pisa? But not in name only, the lady hath merit; Her thoughts have an eye, and the right inward spirit. And dear Lady Morgan! Look, look how she comes, With her pulses all beating for freedom, like drums,— So Irish, so modish, so mixtish, so wild, So committing herself, as she talks, like a child, So trim yet so easy, polite yet big-hearted, That truth and she, try all she can, won't be parted. She'll put on your fashions, your latest new air, And then talk so frankly, she'll make you all stare:— Mrs. Hall may say “Oh,” and Miss Edgeworth say “Fie,” But my lady will know all the what and the why. Her books, a like mixture, are so very clever, The god himself swore he could read them forever; Plot, character, freakishness, all are so good; And the heroine's herself playing tricks in a hood. So he kiss'd her, and call'd her “eternal good wench;” But asked, why the devil she spoke so much French? “Mrs. Norton.” The god, stepping forward a pace, Kiss'd her hand in return, with respect in his face, But said, “Why indulge us with nothing but sighs? You best prove your merits when cheerful and wise: Be still so; be just to the depth of your eyes.” Then he turn'd to us all, and repeated in tones Of approval so earnest as thrill'd to one's bones, Some remarks of hers (bidding us learn them all too) On the art of distinguishing false love from true. After which, as he seated her near him, he cried, “'Twas a large heart, and loving, that gave us this guide.” Well advanc'd, at this juncture, with true loving eyes, Mrs. Opie, delightful for hating “White Lies.” “Good Temper,” too, prince of the Lares (God bless him,) owes Thousands of thanks to her nice duodecimos. —“What! and you too must turn Quakeress, must you?” Cried Phœbus;—“well, spite of your costume I'll trust you: Though truth, you dear goose, as all born Quakeresses Will tell you has nothing in common with dresses: Besides, 'tis blaspheming my colours and skies:— However, it shows you still young, and that's wise; And since you must needs have no fault let us see If you can't mend it somehow, betwixt you and me.” He said; and threw round her a light of such love, As turn'd her slate hues to the neck of the dove. Enter Pardoe all spirits, and Porter all state, But sweet ones, like ladies whom knights made elate, (The latter wore some foreign order, whose name I forget; but it well graced the chivalrous dame.) Then hearty good Roberts; and Roche (dear old deathless Regina, whose lovers my boyhood made breathless,) And Shelley, four-fam'd,—for her parents, her lord, And the poor lone impossible monster abhorr'd. (So sleek and so smiling she came, people stared, To think such fair clay should so darkly have dared; But Apollo the very name lov'd so, he turn'd To a glory all round her, which shook as it burn'd, And a whirlwind of music came sweet from the spheres);— Then his shape he resum'd, with a bay round his ears, And on Sheridan smil'd, name with wit ever found, And on Somerville, head most surprisingly crown'd; For instead of the little Loves, laughing at colleges, Round it, in doctors' caps, flew little Knowledges! Then came young Twamley, nice sensitive thing, Whose pen and whose pencil give promise like spring; Then Whitfield,—then Wortley,—and acridly bright In her eyes, but sweet-lipp'd, the slaves' friend, Fanny Wright. And now came the dance; for, lo! catching up two, Since the guests had all come, Phœbus made, as he flew, A grace and a beauty of waiving decorum (For wit and warm heart carry all things before 'em) And leading the way, swept them off to the ball, Into which he plung'd instantly, music and all; For the band felt his coming, and gave such a rare Storm of welcome, as seem'd to blow back his bright hair; And so he came whirling it, gods! how divinely! The hearts of the whole room, I warrant, beat finely: In fact, hadn't he himself kept their wits sound, The room, the whole evening, had seem'd going round: But, what was amazing, he so danc'd with all, He suffic'd for the total male part of the ball! Not as dancer theatrical, making a show (Bah!—shocking to think of—Excessively no!) But gentlemen-god-like, and all comme-il-faut. Now with one, now with t'other he danc'd, now with ten! For your god in his dancing is several men. Fanny Butler he waltz'd with; he jigg'd it with Morgan; With Hall he developed the rigadoon organ; To Pardoe he show'd Spain's impassioned velocity; Norton, the minuet's high reciprocity. —Then he took Landon, ere she was aware, Like a dove in a whirlwind, and whisk'd her in air; Or as Zephyr might catch up some rose-haunting fay, Or as Mercury once netted Flora, they say. And then again, stately, like any Sultaùn With his Queen, he and Blessington trod a pavàun,— Which meaneth a “peacock dance.” Truly 'twas grand to see How they came spreading it, pavoneggiàndosi! —Up, at the sight, rose the oldest at last, And join'd in a gen'ral dance, “furious and fast,” With which the god mingled, like fire in a wheel, Pervading it, golden; till reel after reel, Bearing sheer off its legs with them giddy three-score, They spun to the supper-room, clean through the door. Then quoth Madame d'Arblay, panting much from her journey, “Well—this beats my father himself, Doctor Burney!!” CANTO III. Of the supper that Apollo gave his visitors, and with what sort of spectacle and of after-course he amazed them. You remember those supper-room walls, made of flowers, Which beat whatsoever for dead paramours The lords of the east in white temples have done, Where in emeralds and rubies fond epitaphs run? Well,—a gallery lurk'd sweetly behind them; and there We spectators, scarce knowing what took us, or where, Got somehow, as soon as the guests had down sat 'em, And found ourselves gazing most snugly down at 'em. And thus as they sat before supper, to rest 'em, Fresh airs through the rooms came increasing, and blest 'em; So sweet, all grew silent, exchanging rapt looks; And the silence ran thick with a bubbling of brooks.— Not long:—for commingling, by finest degrees, With the stir of the foliage, and swell of the breeze, A concert arose,—so delicious, so new, So earnest, so fond, so appealing to you, The notes seem'd to bathe in the tears which they drew. Then there issued (get Vincent Novello, some day, To show you the strain, for he took it away,) A world-heavy gust, like all organs in one, Or as though had swept earthward the roar of the sun, Or the face of some god with his thunder-loud tresses, Who comes like a terror, stays gently, and blesses, And leaves us secure in the strength of humility. —Phœbus however, with host-like civility, Tried them no farther with godhead so grave: To his sprites, on the sudden, blithe orders he gave, And quoting the line about “lips being fed,” (Which applied not alone to one heaven, he said, For ambrosia and nectar sustain'd the realms upper) There rose, veil'd in mist, to soft music, a supper. Very beauteous the mist was,—thin, white, with a bloom; An odour of violets fill'd the whole room; Ever trembled the music; and as the mist clear'd, First, bunches of violets gently appeared,— Then silver,—then gold,—then the tops of decanters Of diamond,—then peaches, those cheek-like enchanters, And other fruit, some in white baskets, and some Enleaf'd on the bough, with a dew on the plum; Then dishes, half seen, fit to make a physician Turn glutton, from dairies and pastures Elysian; The peaches hung over them, ready to drip; And now the guests sat, and the mirth was let slip, And white went the fingers from foliage to lip. Then the music came sweet over all, like the sound Of their fame; and behind ev'ry lady stood, crown'd With the flame on his forehead, her Genius, who went To and fro with his pinions, on messages bent 'Twixt her friends and herself, some sweet fruit or sweet word; And aye at the table sweet laughter was heard. But the best of it was, the god's wit so embrac'd The whole room with its kindness and exquisite taste, Every guest seem'd to feel his arm round her own waist. And well might seem palpable all which he said! For as Pallas leap'd arm'd out of Jupiter's head, So gods, when they please, utter things, and not words! 'Tis a fact!—solid visions!—clouds, armies, trees, herds:— You see them—nay, feel them. Thus, talks he of roses? They come, thick and globy, caressing your noses. Of music? 'tis heard: of a sword? you may grasp it: Of love, and the bosom you long for? you clasp it. Conceive then the joy, when in toasting the women Whom wit hath made deathless, we saw them all swim in! Each crossing the end of the room!—What a sight! The guests thrust their chairs back at first, in a fright. I declare I beheld them so plainly, it took All the self-command in me (so sweet was her look) Not to jump from the gallery, and kiss Mrs. Brooke. Lady Winchelsea cost me still more to go through it; But at Lady Ann Barnard, I said “I must do it” I cannot name all who thus issued from air, As the god made us see them;—but Sappho was there, As brown as a berry, and little of size; But Lord! with such midnight and love in her eyes! Aspasia's however we thought still more loving: Heart sat in their pupils, and gentlest approving. We saw (only fancy it!) Pericles hand her; And both (I can testify) look'd up at Landor. Of Romans (whose women more startle than lull us) Came none but the dame that's bound up with Tibullus; But France furnished many, and Italy fair; The laurel look'd sweet in their wild flowing hair. Colonna came noble, in widow's black gown; And Stampa, who worshipp'd a living renown; Navarre's fair Boccaccio; the Rope-maker too; Deshoulieres, kind and pensive; De Launay the true; Sévigné, good mother, a little too fussy; But how, when she will, she beats Walpole and Bussy! Old selfish Du Deffand, more knowing than wise; And Genlis didactic, and D'Houdetot's eyes; And De Staël, mighty mistress, par Napoleoni, (For so he would make her,) and dear Riccoboni; Then Newcastle's Duchess, fantastic but rare; And Behn and Centlivre, that plain-spoken pair; And Wortley, who, had she been bred in a haram, Had turn'd it, infallibly, all harum-scarum; And sweet Brooke aforesaid, all cover'd with May, And Lady Ann, lovely for “Auld Robin Gray;” And dearest dear Winchelsea, whom I prefer, After all, she so jumps with me, even to her: (For although Lady Ann lov'd maternity, she Lov'd love and the trees so, she might have lov'd me:) But I see high-born Devonshire, who with such pith Wrote of Tell and his platform; and poor Charlotte Smith, Whose muse might have bless'd so her nooks and old houses, Had lawyers not plagued her, and debts of her spouse's: And Tighe, her own Psyche: and Elliott, sweet Jane, Who made the lone dairies mourn Flodden again; And Radcliffe, fear-charm'd, ever breathlessly creeping Through castles and corridors, frightful to sleep in: Then Barbauld, fine teacher, correcting impatience, Or mounting the stars in divine meditations; Thrale, Brunton, Trefusis, her heart pit-a-patting, And Hemans, behind her grand organ-loft chatting; With others I can't well remember at present, Except Hannah More, looking very unpleasant. You'll fancy there could not have possibly been A sight now, which females would sooner have seen Than all this; and in truth, when you mark, in a street, How they turn and inspect ev'ry bonnet they meet, And how light, in comparison, seem to hold men, 'Tis a point I shall leave to some weightier pen. Only pray be assur'd, that whatever the case, It tells not a jot to our sex's disgrace; And for this simple reason,—that us they are sure of, But each other's claims are not quite so secure of. Thus much I can swear,—that what follow'd this show Was a sight made their cheeks with new gratitude glow, And that half the dear souls fell in love on the spot, And with posthumous men too! gallants living not! Alas! did I say so? Oh impious misgiving! Than Shakspeare and Petrarch pray who are more living? Whose words more delight us? whose touches more touch? For these were the shapes that now pass'd us,—all such As the sex should most long to see, out of all story,— The men that have done them most honour and glory. First, Homer Andromache brought, like his child; And beside them was Helen, who blushingly smil'd;— Old trav'ller was he, and he walk'd with a sword. Then Antigone came with the Samian lord, Close-clinging, yet gentle.—Then Petrarch appear'd, Looking still on the face by down-looking endear'd; First exalter of animal passion with mind. Him follow'd, still modestly keeping behind, With book under arm, and in scholarly gown, (Oh! ill have the gross understood his renown!) Boccaccio, with faces a martyr might bless, Griselda's among them, the patient excess. Her look was the sweetest that never knew laughter; And backward she turn'd tow'rds the shape that came after, Great Chaucer. As humbly as maiden went he. Young queens held their diadems of him in fee; Young mothers and beauties, clear angels of earth; I know not which grac'd them most, sorrow or mirth. Great Cervantes was next, fine romance-loving soul (For his very jest lov'd it), with whom came a shoal Of such blithe and sweet beauties, some courtly, some nurst In Arcadia, I thought they were Shakspeare's at first; But when he came, good Lord! what a heaven upon earth Of young beauty was there! what sweet sorrow and mirth! What most womanly women! what passion all beauteous With patience! What love irrepressibly duteous! What players at boyhood, as sweet as in gown! What bosoms, where care might forever lie down! Did heav'n keep a boarding-school, these were its blushers;— But Shakspeares would never have done for the ushers. The women at table, I thought, at this sight, For pure, tongue-tied bliss, would have fainted outright; But Apollo in pity dismiss'd it; and brought Richard Steele on the carpet, the heart of light thought; Who pass'd, with his wit and his wig, midst a bevy Of hoops and bright eyes, as if bound for a levee; Some cheeks were among them, more sweet for a sprinkle Of tears; and the dupe of that horrid beast, Inkle. Steele led by the hand his own wife in the crowd, And as if reassuring her, kiss'd it, and bow'd. In discourse of this kind, and such rapturous expressions As perfectly scorn'd all the old self-possessions, (For really I can't say which rattled most gaily, Dear frank Lady Morgan, or quiet Miss Bailey; Though somebody said, that tow'rds three, Mrs. Hall Was, beyond any question, the merriest of all: And I'm told that Miss Edgeworth became so vivacious, The damsels from boarding-school whispered, “My gracious!”) In talk of this kind, and a world of sweet will, Which turn'd all our heads ('tis in mine dancing still) The delight ran its rounds, till 'twas time to break up; When Apollo, instead of the old parting cup, (Which with ladies might not have been quite so decorous) Exclaim'd, “Set the new parting dishes before us.” No sooner exclaim'd than accomplish'd. Behold Ev'ry guest had a cover of exquisite mould, Rich yet simple, of porcelain. Angelica's self Had had twice her attractions, with one on her shelf. The sides were all painted, not only with Muses And Loves, but with Lares, and sweet Household Uses: Good Temper was laying a cloth for Good Heart, And the Graces were actually making a tart! Each cover for knob had a ruby, heart-shap'd; And the whole stood on legs, with white elegance drap'd,— Legs bewitching, most feminine, tipp'd with a shoe; And the stockings (mark that!) were a violet blue. All the room fell a whispering;—“What can they be?” “Is it sweets?”—“concert-tickets?”—“It cannot be tea?” “I'd give millions to know,” said Miss Porter. “And I,” Said Miss Barrett, “my head.” Said Miss Landon, “I'd die.” “You may see it ex pede,” said Mrs. Gore, chuckling: “'Tis something dress'd à la Sir John—à la Suckling.” And 'twas so.—O Suckling, O gallant Sir John, Thou gentleman poet, first plume of the ton; Who the reign or two Charleses by anticipation Didst mingle in one with thy cordial flirtation; Fresh painter of “Weddings,” great author of rare “Poet-Sessions,” and petit-soupés to the fair; Unto whom thou didst make happy milliner-loves With bijou for the sweetmeats, and dishes of gloves, And sent'st home the darlings in flutters of fan, At the wit of the thought of the exquisite man! O facile princeps of “wit about town,” What a bay clips thee now! What a crown above crown! Homer's self had but men for his copiers; but thee Homer's very god copies, thou great bel esprit! The genius that stood behind each lady's chair, From her dish took the cover; when forth, in glad air, Leap'd a couple of small merry Loves, who display'd What d'ye think?—a new girdle? a busk? a new braid? No;—the sweetest Blue Stockings that ever were made. The blue was a violet, fresh as first love; And the garters were blush-colour, mingled with dove. To describe the “sensation” produced by this sight, The dismays, pretty doubtings, the laughs, the delight, Were a task I should never have done, if I told ye, And haste does not let me; for lo and behold ye! As doves round a house-top, in summer-time blue, Take a sudden stoop earthwards, and sweep from the view, So the Loves, one and all, rising first with a clapping Of pinions, pass'd by us, tempestuously flapping; Then stoop'd, quick as lightning, and gliding right under The table, all vanish'd!—A shriek of sweet wonder Rose sudden and brief, as of fear come and gone; And 'twas felt thro' the room, that the stockings were on! Mute, curious, respectful (for all were inspir'd With the feelings so nice an occasion requir'd) We sat for some moments, as still as Apollo's Own table; till sweet, as when breath fills the hollows Of organs, mild waking,—he utter'd what follows:— “Dear souls with fine eyes (may they never be kiss'd By a fool!) fear no more the mistakes that exist With regard to these footings of yours, and their blue; Fear no more the confusion of false and of true; Strange confusion at any time, seeing its grounds! For who, in his taste, sweet and bitter confounds? And whence rose it? An authoress, once on a time, Could discover, it seems, no such wonderful crime In the legs of an honest old soul at her party, Who came in his blue stockings, ancient and hearty, (Ben Stillingfleet namely, fine-hearted old codger; A loving old bachelor,—real Sir Roger;) But coxcombs (themselves a pedantical crew) Palm'd, in spite, upon her, the old gentleman's blue; And thence, by as clever and handsome transition, Assum'd it of all in like letter'd condition. As nicknames, however, are things we've a dread of In heaven itself, they're so hard to get rid of, And as the best way to divert their abuse (If we use them at all) is to give them right use, I hereby ordain, that in future the word Be confined to the masculine, vain, and absurd, And that all real women, ev'n though they may speak Not with Sappho's eyes only, but even her Greek, All the flow'rs of the flock, the true breathers of sweets, Take their name from the queen of the sylvan retreats; From the hue which but now had your eyes fix'd upon it,— The Violet,—charmer of all that light on it. No Blue,” 'twill be said, “is the she who so bears her; She's Violet:—happy the bosom that wears her.” Here somebody happening to cough where we sat, Phœbus threw up a frown at us none could look at,— An eye of so sudden a flame and tremendous, I thought he was going to “flare up” and end us; But seeing us all look submissive, he shone With the former mild beams in his hair, and went on:— “And in truth it depends on yourselves, darling creatures, Which shade of the hue shall illustrate your natures; For though ye set out with the right one, nay, though I myself, as I now do, the blessing bestow, Yet the stockings themselves, I must tell you, are fated, And just as they're worn, will be lov'd or get hated; Remaining true violet,—glimpses of heaven,— As long as you're wise, and your tempers are even. But if you grow formal, or fierce, or untrue, Alas, gentle colour! sweet ankle, adieu! Thou art chang'd; and Love's self at the changing looks blue. Seize the golden occasion then.—You, who already Are gentle, remain so; and you, who would steady Your natures, and mend them, and make out your call To be men's best companions, be such, once for all. And remember, that nobody, woman or man, Ever charm'd the next ages, since writing began, Who thought by shrewd dealing sound fame to arrive at, Had one face in print, and another in private. “Unaffectedness, Gentleness, Lovingness.—This Be your motto. And now give your teacher a kiss.” He said: and the whole house appearing to rise, Rooms and all, in a rapture of love, tow'rds the skies, He did really, by some divine privilege of his, Give and take of the dames an ubiquitous kiss; Which exalted us all so, and rapt us so far, We undoubtedly touch'd at some exquisite star; Very likely the morning star, Venus's own, For the odour proclaim'd it some violet zone: And to prove 'twas no dream, any more than the bedding Which Prince Camaralzaman had or Bedredden, I woke, just as they did, at home, about seven, The moment Miss Landon was saying “Good Heaven!” THE ST. JAMES'S PHENOMENON. BEING A SURPRISING NEW BALLAD, ON A MOST WONDERFUL CREATURE NOW EXHIBITING IN WESTMINSTER. Good people all, attend now, And I'll tell ye of such a monster, As shall make your eyes Be double their size, And the hats that ye have on stir. I'm aware there've been before this As pretty frights as may be, Two sisters in one, And babes like a tun, And much worse things than they be. For I've heard of an unlegg'd body That went about on castors, And a head that would come Bolt into a room, And cry, “How now, my masters!” But Lord! all these were handsome To the one I'm going to mention; To whom a shark Is a perfect spark, And an ogre deserves a pension. Hard by St. James's Palace You may see this prince of shockings, But not before three, For at one, d'ye see, He begins to put on his stockings. His head, or else what should be In the place that's on his shoulders, Is nothing but hair Frizz'd here and there, To the terror of all beholders. That it has a mouth, is clear from His drinkings and his vap'rings; But all agree That he cannot see, For he'll take a pig for a prince. To tell you what his throat is, Is a matter a little puzzling; But I should guess, That more or less, It was forty yards of muslin. His shoulders are very curious, And really none of the wildest; For both are made Of cane inlaid; And here, they say, he's mildest. Of his fingers a tailor tells me (For one here and there the truth picks) That the right, when they span, Are a lady's fan, And the left a start of tooth-picks. His legs are just like barrels With butts of leather on 'em; Yet some declare That without great care He can't stand long upon 'em. But his body, his body's the wonder, For a lady who touch'd the surface, Look'd pale and said, 'Twas a positive bed:— I wish you had seen her face. His organs of digestion Make a noise like the wheels of mangles; His tongue's a skin, And hollow within; And his teeth are dice at angles. For the rest there's no deciding; But it's fully believed on all hands, That his brains are veal, And his heart of steel, And his blood rum-punch and hollands. N. B. Behave respectful; For if he thinks you flout him, He's got a big Old Judge's wig, Wherewith he lays about him. CORONATION SOLILOQUY OF HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE THE FOURTH. 1821. To the tune ofAmo, amas, I love a lass As cedar tall and slender; Sweet cowslip's grace, Is her nominative case, And she's of the feminine gender. Horum quorum, Sunt divorum, Harum, scarum, divo; Tag rag, merry derry, periwig and hatband, Hic, hoc, harum, genitivo. O'Keefe. I Rego, regis, Good God, what's this? What, only half my Peeries! Regas, regat, Good God, what's that? The voice is like my deary's! Oh, no more there; Shut the door there; Harum, scarum, strife O! Bags, Bags, Sherry Derry, periwigs, and fat lads, Save us from our wife O! II I decline a C. Regina, Rex alone's more handsome: Oh what luck, Sir, Exit uxor! Rursus ego a man sum. Glory, glory! How will story Tell how I was gazed at! Perfect from my pumps, to the plumes above my hat-band, All are me amazed at! III Yes, my hat, Sirs, Think of that, Sirs, Vast, and plumed, and Spain-like: See my big, Grand robes; my wig Young, yet lion-mane like. Glory! glory! I'm not hoary; Age it can't come o'er me: Mad caps, grave caps, gazing on the grand man, All alike adore me. IV I know where A fat, a fair, Sweet other self is doting: I'd reply With wink of eye, But fear the newsman noting. Hah! the Toying, Never cloying, Cometh to console me: Crowns and sceptres, jewellery, state swords,— Who now shall control me? V Must I walk now! What a baulk now! Non est regis talis. O, for youth now! For in truth now, Non sum eram qualis. Well, well, roar us, On before us, Harum, flarum, stout O, Stately, greatly, periwig and trumpets,— Oh, could I leave but my gout O! VI What a dies! How it fri-es! Handkerchiefs for sixty. Approbatio! Sibilatio! How I feel betwixt ye! Curlies, burlies, Dukes and earlies, Bangs and clangs of band O! Shouty, flouty, heavy rig, and gouty, When shall I come to a stand O! VII Bliss at last! The street is pass'd; The aisle—I've dragg'd me through it: Oh the rare Old crowning chair! I fear I flopp'd into it. Balmy, balmy, Comes the psalmy; Bland the organ blows me; Crown down coming on a periwig that fits me, All right royal shows me! VIII Oh how bona My corona! Sitting so how dulcis! My oculus grim, And my sceptrum slim, And proud, as I hold it, my pulse is! Shout us, chorus; Organs, roar us; Realms, let a secret start ye:— Dragon-killing George on the coin is myself, And the dragon is Bonaparte. IX And yet alas! Must e'en I pass Through hisses again on foot, Sirs! Oh pang profound! And I now walk crown'd, And with sceptre in hand to boot, Sirs! I go, I go, With a fire in my toe, I'm bowing, blasting, baking! Hall, O Hall, ope your doors, and let your guest in; Every inch I'm à—king. X But now we dine! Oh word divine, Beyond what e'en has crown'd it! Envy may call Great monarchs small, But feast, and you dumb-found it. Brandy, brandy, To steady me handy For playing my knife and fork, O! Green fat, and devilry, shall warrant me ere bed-time, In drawing my twentieth cork O. XI. Hah, my Champy! Plumy, trampy! Astley's best can't beat him! See his frown! His glove thrown down! Should a foe appear, he'd eat him! Glory, glory, Glut and glory,— I mean poury, Glut and poury,— Poury, mory, Splash and floory, Crown us, drown us, vivo! Cram dram, never end, plethora be d?n'd, man; Vivat Rex dead-alive O! HIGH AND LOW; OR, HOW TO WRITE HISTORY. SUGGESTED BY AN ARTICLE IN A REVIEW FROM THE PEN OF SIR WALTER SCOTT, IN WHICH ACCOUNTS ARE GIVEN OF MASSANIELLO AND THE DUKE OF GUISE. “I noticed a deserted corpse that lay in a corner, with a label attached to the breast. It was evidently one of the humblest citizens, and the address was ‘Rue St. Antoine.’ Honour to whom it was due! The Hampdens who saved Paris, and probably all France, from the paternal ordonnances of his Most Christian Majesty, were the canaille of St. Antoine, St. Denis, and St. Martin—men whom the chivalrous Sir Walter Scott would term the ‘brutal populace of a great town.’ His ‘high-born and high-bred’ warriors never achieved a victory more beneficial to mankind. The freedom not only of France, but of all the Continent, was weighed in the balance against despotism, and prevailed by the efforts of soiled and swarthy artisans.” —Letter from Paris, in the Spectator. That fisherman they talk of,—Massaniello,— Was clearly, by his birth, a sorry fellow, One of the raffs we shrink from in the street, Wore an old hat, and went with naked feet; Which made him fancy, the vain dog! he knew More truths of poverty than I or you; Felt more for people's wrongs; and loath'd to see 'em, For pure starvation, forc'd to sing Te Deum. [For all reform is vanity or will; A modest man damns freedom, and sits still.] So up this foppish Fisherman arose, Got the poor fed, and help'd himself to cloès, And brought such wondering gallants to the block, That writers for a court still feel the shock. I cannot mention him myself, I own, Nor paint the dread plebeian on his throne, But fear must pelt his memory with a stone. But mark, ye vain reformers, and beware; Sore ills beset this new Dictator's chair: Sore ills, and sore disputes; conspiring lords, Fear to do wrong, daggers, and bowls, and cords; Till vex'd, and finding what a task he had, And losing his nights' rest, the man went mad! The people's head went mad! So dire a thing It is, in men, to imitate a King! Well,—being mad, of course he laid about him, Till friends, like foes, were glad to do without him; They kill'd him; kick'd his body, which was funny; And lords, from out of windows, threw them money. So much for shoeless, hatless Massaniello, Meaning “Tom Lamb!” “Tom Lamb!!” Think of the fellow!!! On t'other hand, commend me to the ease And noble bearing of the Duke of Guise! High-born and hot, respectable of course, And one that sat most gracefully his horse. So great a soul was Guise, that “When,” said he, “God makes a person of my quality, He stamps a something on him, 'twixt the eyes, At which the heart within a tradesman dies.” [Reader, if this be hard to understand, Vide some Duke,—for instance, Cumberland.] This Duke, so proper to direct the poor, Not getting to be master, curst and swore, Kick'd the French flag, blasphem'd till he was hoarse, And utter'd things (I'm loth to say it) coarse. Something of this might possibly be true; 'Tis awful to reflect what rage can do; But I suspect, that much of it was merely A mode of venting his high mind sincerely; Pure, sprightly oaths, and gentlemanly fire; At least, th' accuser is a “vulgar friar.” I grant the Duke of Guise thought no great things Of a few stabs, and petty poisonings: 'Tis curious, now-a-days, when people scout 'em, To see how quietly he talks about 'em: But these were peccadilloes in those times, Freaks of high birth, expediencies, no crimes: Not like the vices of a low-born rabble, Outcry, and want, and Famine's idiot babble. Besides, “his situation forc'd” our hero To be a bit of Bloody-bones and Nero, A thing in mobs which never can take place; And then 'twas in the blood of all his race; And if their son, poor fellow, was no wiser, The reason was, “he wanted an adviser.” In short, give me, for a display of force, A high-born, hacking blade upon a horse; Who pummels the base many, that pretend God made their skulls to any other end; Not a low humanist, without a sou, Who reads disgusting lessons to the few. DOCTOR BAN; OR, QUESTION FOR QUESTION. Terror's and wrath's brave champion, Doctor Ban, Scorning us holders to the loving plan, Asks if we “take God for a gentleman?” The scandal of the question match who can! God's not, we own, to be defined by man; But why must he resemble Doctor Ban?</field>

Dear Barnes, whose native taste, solid and clear, The throng of life has strengthen'd without harm, You know the rural feeling, and the charm That stillness has for a world-fretted ear: 'Tis now deep whispering all about me here With thousand tiny hushings, like a swarm Of atom bees, or fairies in alarm, Or noise of numerous bliss from distant sphere. This charm our evening hours duly restore,— Nought heard through all our little, lull'd abode, Save the crisp fire, or leaf of book turn'd o'er, Or watch-dog, or the ring of frosty road. Wants there no other sound, then?—yes, one more,— The voice of friendly visiting, long owed. TO HAMPSTEAD. WRITTEN DURING THE AUTHOR'S IMPRISONMENT, August, 1813. Sweet upland, to whose walks, with fond repair, Out of thy western slope I took my rise Day after day, and on these feverish eyes Met the moist fingers of the bathing air;— If health, unearn'd of thee, I may not share, Keep it, I pray thee, where my memory lies, In thy green lanes, brown dells, and breezy skies, Till I return, and find thee doubly fair. Wait then my coming, on that lightsome land, Health, and the joy that out of nature springs, And Freedom's air-blown locks;—but stay with me, Friendship, frank entering with the cordial hand, And Honour, and the Muse with growing wings, And Love Domestic, smiling equably. TO THE SAME. AT THE SAME PERIOD, NOVEMBER, 1814. [Winter has reach'd thee once again at last] Winter has reach'd thee once again at last, And now the rambler, whom thy groves yet please, Feels on his house-warm lips the thin air freeze, While in his shrugging neck the resolute blast Comes edging; and the leaves, in heaps down cast, He shuffles with his hastening foot, and sees The cold sky whitening through the wiry trees, And sighs to think his loitering noons have pass'd. And do I love thee less, to paint thee so? No. This the season is of beauty still, Doubled at heart; of smoke, with whirling glee Uptumbling ever from the blaze below, And home remember'd most,—and oh, lov'd hill, The second, and the last, away from thee. TO THE SAME. DURING THE SAME PERIOD, AUGUST, 1814. [They tell me, when my tongue grows warm on thee] They tell me, when my tongue grows warm on thee, Dear gentle hill, with tresses green and bright, That thou art wanting in the finishing sight Freshest of all for summer eyes to see;— That whatsoe'er thy charm of tower and tree, Of dell wrapp'd in, or airy-viewing height, No water looks from out thy face with light, Or waits upon thy walks refreshfully. It may be so, despite of pond or brook:— Yet not to me so full of all that's fair. Though frail-embower'd, with fingering sun between, Were the divinest fount in Fancy's nook, In which the nymphs sit tying up their hair, Their white backs glistening through the myrtles green. TO THE SAME. IN THE SPRING THAT SUCCEEDED IMPRISONMENT, MAY, 1815. [The baffled spell that bound me is undone] The baffled spell that bound me is undone, And I have breathed once more beneath thy sky, Lovely-brow'd Hampstead; and my looks have run, O'er and about thee: and had scarce drawn nigh, When I beheld, in momentary sun, One of thy hills gleam bright and bosomy, Just like that orb of orbs, a human one, Let forth by chance upon a lover's eye. Forgive me then, that not till now I spoke; For all the comforts, miss'd in close distress, With airy nod came up from every part, O'er-smiling speech: and so I gazed, and took A long, deep draught of silent freshfulness, Ample, and gushing round my feeble heart. TO THE SAME. IN THE SAME MONTH—SAME YEAR. [As one who after long and far-spent years] As one who after long and far-spent years Comes on his mistress in an hour of sleep, And wond'ring half that he can silence keep, Stands smiling o'er her through a flash of tears, To see how sweet and self-same she appears; Till at his touch, with little moving creep Of joy, she wakes from out her calmness deep, And then his heart finds voice, and dances round her ears:— So I, first coming on my haunts again, In pause and stillness of the early prime, Stood thinking of the past and present time With earnest eyesight, scarcely cross'd with pain; Till the fresh-moving leaves, and startling birds, Loosen'd my long-suspended breath in words. THE NILE. It flows through old hush'd Ægypt and its sands, Like some grave mighty thought threading a dream, And times and things, as in that vision, seem Keeping along it their eternal stands,— Caves, pillars, pyramids, the shepherd bands That roamed through the young world, the glory extreme Of high Sesostris, and that southern beam, The laughing queen that caught the world's great hands. Then comes a mightier silence, stern and strong, As of a world left empty of its throng, And the void weighs on us; and then we wake, And hear the fruitful stream lapsing along 'Twixt villages, and think how we shall take Our own calm journey on for human sake. TO THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET. Green little vaulter in the sunny grass, Catching your heart up at the feel of June, Sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon, When even the bees lag at the summoning brass And you, warm little housekeeper, who class With those who think the candles come too soon, Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune Nick the glad silent moments as they pass; Oh sweet and tiny cousins, that belong, One to the fields, the other to the hearth, Both have your sunshine; both, though small, are strong At your clear hearts; and both seem given to earth To ring in thoughtful ears this natural song— In doors and out, summer and winter, Mirth. December 30th, 1816. TO HENRY ROBERTSON, JOHN GATTIE, AND VINCENT NOVELLO, NOT KEEPING THEIR APPOINTED HOUR. Harry, my friend, who full of tasteful glee, Have music all about you, heart and lips; And, John, whose voice is like a rill that slips Over the sunny pebbles breathingly; And, Vincent, you, who with like mastery Can chase the notes with fluttering finger-tips, Like fairies down a hill hurrying their trips, Or sway the organ with firm royalty; Why stop ye on the road? The day, 'tis true, Shows us as in a diamond all things clear, And makes the hill-surmounting eye rejoice, Doubling the earthly green, the heavenly blue; But come, complete the charm of such a sphere, And give the beauty of the day a voice. TO THOMAS STOTHARD, R.A. Thy fancy lives in a delightful sphere, Stothard,—fit haunt for spirit so benign; For never since those southern masters fine, Whose pictured shapes like their own souls appear Reflected many a way in waters clear, Has the true woman's gentle mien divine Looked so, as in those breathing heads of thine, With parted locks, and simple cheek sincere. Therefore, against our climate's chilly hold, Thou hast a nest in sunny glades and bowers; And there, about thee, never growing old, Are these fair things, clear as the lily flowers, Such as great Petrarch loved,—only less cold, More truly virtuous, and of gladdening powers. TO MY WIFE. ON MODELLING MY BUST. Ah, Marian mine, the face you look on now Is not exactly like my wedding-day's: Sunk is its cheek, deeper-retired its gaze, Less white and smooth its temple-flattened brow. Sorrow has been there with his silent plough, And strait, stern hand. No matter, if it raise Aught that affection fancies, it may praise, Or make me worthier than Apollo's bough. Loss, after all,—such loss especially,— Is transfer, change, but not extinction,—no; Part in our children's apple cheeks I see; And, for the rest, while you look at me so, Take care you do not smile it back to me, And miss the copied furrows as you go. TO KOSCIUSKO, WHO NEVER FOUGHT EITHER FOR BONAPARTE OR THE ALLIES. 'Tis like thy patient valour thus to keep, Great Kosciusko, to the rural shade, While Freedom's ill-found amulet still is made Pretence for old aggression, and a heap Of selfish mockeries. There, as in the sweep Of stormier fields, thou earnest with thy blade, Transform'd, not inly alter'd, to the spade, Thy never yielding right to a calm sleep. There came a wanderer, borne from land to land Upon a couch, pale, many-wounded, mild, His brow with patient pain dulcetly sour. Men stoop'd with awful sweetness on his hand, And kiss'd it; and collected Virtue smiled, To think how sovereign her enduring hour. ON A LOCK OF MILTON'S HAIR. It lies before me there, and my own breath Stirs its thin outer threads, as though beside The living head I stood in honour'd pride, Talking of lovely things that conquer death. Perhaps he press'd it once, or underneath Ran his fine fingers, when he leant, blank-eyed, And saw, in fancy, Adam and his bride With their rich locks, or his own Delphic wreath. There seems a love in hair, though it be dead. It is the gentlest, yet the strongest thread Of our frail plant,—a blossom from the tree Surviving the proud trunk;—as though it said Patience and Gentleness is Power. In me Behold affectionate eternity. TO PERCY SHELLEY, ON THE DEGRADING NOTIONS OF DEITY. What wonder, Percy, that with jealous rage Men should defame the kindly and the wise, When in the midst of the all-beauteous skies, And all this lovely world, that should engage Their mutual search for the old golden age, They seat a phantom, swelled into grim size Out of their own passions and bigotries, And then, for fear, proclaim it meek and sage! And this they call a light and a revealing! Wise as the clown, who plodding home at night In autumn, turns at call of fancied elf, And sees upon the fog, with ghastly feeling, A giant shadow in its imminent might, Which his own lanthorn throws up from himself. TO MISS K. WRITTEN ON A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE HEADED WITH A LONG LIST OF TREES. There, Bess, your namesake held not sceptred hand Under a canopy, so full and bright, Not even that which Spenser hung with light, And little shouldering angels made expand, When she sat arbitress of fairy-land. Fancy a sun o'er head, to make the sight Warm outwards, and a bank with daisies white, And you're a rural queen, finished and fanned. And now what sylvan homage would it please Your Leafyship to have? bracelets of berries, Feathers of jays, or tassels made of cherries, Strawberries and milk, or pippins crisp to squeeze? No, says your smile,—but two things richer far, A verse, and a staunch friend;—and here they are. TO THE AUTHOR OF “ION.” I. I could not come to shed a man's rare tears With those who honour'd, and who lov'd, thy play; My heart said “yes,” but the sick room said “nay,” And the good doctor with his earnest fears. Yet I was with thee,—saw thine high compeers, Wordsworth and Landor,—saw the piled array, The many-visag'd heart, looking one way, Come to drink beauteous truth at eyes and ears. Now said I to myself,—The scenes arise; Now comes the sweet of name, whom great Love sunders From love itself; now, now he gives the skies The heart they gave (sweet thought 'gainst bitter wonders!) And ever and aye, hands, stung with tear-thrilled eyes, Snapping the silence, burst in crashing thunders. II. Yes, I beheld the old accustom'd sight, Pit, boxes, galleries; I was at “the play;” I saw uprise the stage's strange floor-day, And music tuning as in tune's despite; Childhood I saw, glad-faced, that squeezeth tight One's hand, while the rapt curtain soars away,— And beauty and age, and all that piled array— Thousands of souls drawn to one wise delight. A noble spectacle!—Noble in mirth— Nobler in sacred fellowship of tears! I've often asked myself what sight on earth Is worth the fancying of our fellow spheres; And this is one—whole hosts in love with worth, Judging the shapes of their own hopes and fears. III. Fine age is ours, and marvellous—setting free Hopes that were bending into gray despairs, Winnowing iron like chaff, outspeeding the airs, Conquering with smoky flag the winds at sea, Flinging from thund'rous wheels, immeasurably, Knowledge like daily light: so that man stares, Planet-struck with his work-day world, nor dares Repeat the old babble of what “shall never be.” A great good age!—Greatest and best in this,— That it strikes dumb the old anti-creeds, which parted Man from the child—prosperity from the bliss Of faith in good—and toil of wealth unthwarted From leisure crown'd with bay, such as thine is, Talfourd! a lawyer prosperous and young-hearted. TO CHARLES DICKENS. As when a friend (himself in music's list) Stands by some rare, full-handed organist, And glorying as he sees the master roll The surging sweets through all their depths of soul, Cannot, encouraged by his smile, forbear With his own hand to join them here and there; And so, if little, yet add something more To the sound's volume and the golden roar; So I, dear friend, Charles Dickens, though thy hand Needs but itself, to charm from land to land, Make bold to join in summoning men's ears To this thy new-found music of our spheres, In hopes that by thy Household Words and thee The world may haste to days of harmony. TO POERIO AND HIS FELLOW-PATRIOTS. O noble souls, freed from the foulest spite That ever tyrannous and heartless fool Wreak'd on the worth that shamed his worthless rule, Linking your very bodies, day and night, With lower souls, in hopes your patient might Would droop despairing, as by Stygian pool; (But you, oh you, masters in sorrow's school, Lifted the heart-touch'd lowness to your height);— Oh resting now, where men can trust a throne, And served with such deep honour as endures Beyond all gauds (for in comparison With years of conquest over woes like yours, Glory, the Frenchman's feather, may be spurn'd) Live long the new-found life your great good hearts have earn'd. THE FISH, THE MAN, AND THE SPIRIT. TO FISH. You strange, astonish'd-looking, angle-faced, Dreary-mouth'd, gaping wretches of the sea, Gulping salt-water everlastingly, Cold-blooded, though with red your blood be graced, And mute, though dwellers in the roaring waste; And you, all shapes beside, that fishy be,— Some round, some flat, some long, all devilry, Legless, unloving, infamously chaste:— O scaly, slippery, wet, swift, staring wights, What is't ye do? what life lead? eh, dull goggles? How do ye vary your vile days and nights? How pass your Sundays? Are ye still but joggles In ceaseless wash? Still nought but gapes and bites, And drinks, and stares, diversified with boggles? A FISH ANSWERS. Amazing monster! that, for aught I know, With the first sight of thee didst make our race Forever stare! O flat and shocking face, Grimly divided from the breast below! Thou that on dry land horribly dost go With a split body and most ridiculous pace, Prong after prong, disgracer of all grace, Long-useless-finned, hair'd, upright, unwet, slow! O breather of unbreathable, sword-sharp air, How canst exist? How bear thyself, thou dry And dreary sloth. What particle canst share Of the only blessed life, the watery? I sometimes see of ye an actual pair Go by! link'd fin by fin! most odiously. The Fish turns into a Man, and then into a Spirit, and again speaks. Indulge thy smiling scorn, if smiling still, O man! and loathe, but with a sort of love: For difference must its use by difference prove, And, in sweet clang, the spheres with music fill. One of the spirits am I, that at his will Live in whate'er has life—fish, eagle, dove— No hate, no pride, beneath nought, nor above, A visitor of the rounds of God's sweet skill. Man's life is warm, glad, sad, 'twixt loves and graves, Boundless in hope, honour'd with pangs austere, Heaven-gazing; and his angel-wings he craves: The fish is swift, small-needing, vague yet clear, A cold, sweet, silver life, wrapp'd in round waves, Quicken'd with touches of transporting fear. THE DEFORMED CHILD. BY VINCENT LEIGH HUNT. [Vincent Leigh Hunt was the youngest son of Leigh Hunt, and died when quite young. In a letter to the editor of an American edition of his Poetical Works, Mr. Hunt thus spoke of him: “His whole life was full of sympathy. A sonnet like this will allow his father to indulge a hope, that wherever any Sonnets of his own may be thought worth collecting, they and it may never be parted.” —Editor.] An Angel prisoned in an infant frame Of mortal sickness and deformity, Looks patiently from out that languid eye Matured, and seeming large with pain. The name Of “happy childhood” mocks his movements tame, So propp'd with piteous crutch, or forced to lie Rather than sit, in his frail chair, and try To taste the pleasure of the unshared game. He does; and faintly claps his withered hands To see how brother Willie caught the ball; Kind brother Willie, strong, yet gentle all: 'Twas he that placed him where his chair now stands In that warm corner 'gainst the sunny wall— God, in that brother, gave him more than lands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Blank Verse. PAGANINI. A FRAGMENT. So play'd of late to every passing thought With finest change (might I but half as well So write!) the pale magician of the bow, Who brought from Italy the tales, made true, Of Grecian lyres; and on his sphery hand, Loading the air with dumb expectancy, Suspended, ere it fell, a nation's breath. He smote,—and clinging to the serious chords With godlike ravishment, drew forth a breath, So deep, so strong, so fervid thick with love, Blissful, yet laden as with twenty prayers, That Juno yearn'd with no diviner soul To the first burthen of the lips of Jove. The exceeding mystery of the loveliness Sadden'd delight; and with his mournful look, Dreary and gaunt, hanging his pallid face 'Twixt his dark flowing locks, he almost seem'd, To feeble or to melancholy eyes, One that had parted with his soul for pride, And in the sable secret liv'd forlorn. But true and earnest, all too happily That skill dwelt in him, serious with its joy; For noble now he smote the exulting strings, And bade them march before his stately will; And now he lov'd them like a cheek, and laid Endearment on them, and took pity sweet; And now he was all mirth, or all for sense And reason, carving out his thoughts like prose After his poetry; or else he laid His own soul prostrate at the feet of love, And with a full and trembling fervour deep, In kneeling and close-creeping urgency, Implor'd some mistress with hot tears; which past, And after patience had brought right of peace, He drew, as if from thoughts finer than hope, Comfort around him in ear-soothing strains And elegant composure; or he turn'd To heaven instead of earth, and rais'd a pray'r So earnest vehement, yet so lowly sad, Mighty with want and all poor human tears, That never saint, wrestling with earthly love, And in mid-age unable to get free, Tore down from heav'n such pity. Or behold, In his despair, (for such, from what he spoke Of grief before it, or of love, 'twould seem,) Jump would he into some strange wail uncouth Of witches' dance, ghastly with whinings thin And palsied nods—mirth wicked, sad, and weak, And then with show of skill mechanical, Marvellous as witchcraft, he would overthrow That vision with a show'r of notes like hail, Or sudden mixtures of all difficult things Never yet heard; flashing the sharp tones now, In downward leaps like swords; now rising fine Into some utmost tip of minute sound, From whence he stepp'd into a higher and higher On viewless points, till laugh took leave of him: Or he would fly as if from all the world To be alone and happy, and you should hear His instrument become a tree far off, A nest of birds and sunbeams, sparkling both, A cottage-bow'r: or he would condescend, In playful wisdom which knows no contempt, To bring to laughing memory, plain as sight, A farm-yard with its inmates, ox and lamb, The whistle and the whip, with feeding hens In household fidget muttering evermore, And, rising as in scorn, crown'd Chanticleer, Ordaining silence with his sovereign crow. Then from one chord of his amazing shell Would he fetch out the voice of choirs, and weight Of the built organ; or some twofold strain Moving before him in sweet-going yoke, Ride like an Eastern conqueror, round whose state Some light Morisco leaps with his guitar; And ever and anon o'er these he'd throw Jets of small notes like pearl, or like the pelt Of lovers' sweetmeats on Italian lutes From windows on a feast-day, or the leaps Of pebbled water, sprinkled in the sun, One chord affecting all:—and when the ear Felt there was nothing present but himself And silence, and the wonder drew deep sighs, Then would his bow lie down again in tears, And speak to some one in a pray'r of love, Endless, and never from his heart to go: Or he would talk as of some secret bliss, And at the close of all the wonderment (Which himself shar'd) near and more near would come Into the inmost ear, and whisper there Breathings so soft, so low, so full of life, Touch'd beyond sense, and only to be borne By pauses which made each less bearable, That out of pure necessity for relief From that heap'd joy, and bliss that laugh'd for pain, The thunder of th' uprolling house came down, And bow'd the breathing sorcerer into smiles. OUR COTTAGE. Some few of us, children and grown, possess A cottage, far remov'd. 'Tis in a glade, Where the sun harbours; and one side of it Listens to bees, another to a brook. Lovers, that have just parted for the night, Dream of such spots, when they have said their pray'rs,— Or some tir'd parent, holding by the hand A child, and walking tow'rds the setting sun. No news comes here; no scandal; no routine Of morning visit; not a postman's knock,— That double thrust of the long staff of care. We are as distant from the world, in spirit If not in place, as though in Crusoe's isle, And please ourselves with being ignorant Ev'n of the country some five miles beyond. Our wood's our world, with some few hills and dales, And many an alley green, with poppies edg'd And flowery brakes, where sails the long blue fly, Whom we pronounce a fairy; and 'twould go Hard with us to be certain he's not one, Such willing children are we of the possible. Hence all our walks have names; some of the Fairies, And some of Nymphs, (where the brook makes a bath In a green chamber, and the turf's half violets,) And some of Grim Old Men that live alone, And may not be seen safely. Pan has one Down in a beech-dell; and Apollo another, Where sunset in the trees makes strawy fires. You might suppose the place pick'd out of books. The nightingales, in the cold blooms, are there Fullest of heart, hushing our open'd windows; The cuckoo ripest in the warmed thicks. Autumn, the princely season, purple-rob'd And liberal-handed, brings no gloom to us, But, rich in its own self, gives us rich hope Of winter-time; and when the winter comes, We burn old wood, and read old books that wall Our biggest room, and take our heartiest walks On the good, hard, glad ground; or when it rains And the rich dells are mire, make much and long Of a small bin we have of good old wine; And talk of, perhaps entertain, some friend, Whom, old or young, we gift with the same grace Of ancient epithet; for love is time With us; youth old as love, and age as young; And stars, affections, hopes, roll all alike Immortal rounds, in heaven when not on earth. Therefore the very youngest of us all Do we call old,—“old Vincent,” or “old Jule,” Or “old Jacintha;” and they count us young, And at a very playfellow time of life, As in good truth we are: witness the nuts We seek, to pelt with, in thy trampled leaves, November; and the merry Christmas ring, Hot-fac'd and loud with too much fire and food,— The rare excess, loving the generous gods. “Old Mary,” and “old Percy,” and “old Henry,” Also there are, with more beyond their teens; But these are reverend youngsters, married now, And ride no longer to our cottage nest On that unbridled horse, their father's knee. Custom itself is an old friend with us; Though change we make a friend, too, if it come To better custom: nay, to bury him, Provided soul be gone, and it be done Rev'rently and kindly; and we then install His son, or set a new one in his place; For all good honest customs, from all lands, Find welcome here,—seats built up in old elms From France; and evening dances on the green; And servants (home's inhabiting strangers) turn'd To zealous friends; and gipsy meals, whose smoke Warms houseless glades; and the good bout Chinese At pen and ink, in rhyming summer bow'rs, Temper'd with pleasant penalties of wine. The villagers love us; and on Sabbath-days, (Such luck is ours, and round harmonious life) In an old, ivied church (which God preserve, And make a mark forever of the love That by mild acquiescence bears all change And keeps all better'd good!) no priest like ours Utters such Christian lore, so final sweet, So fit for audience in those flowery dells. Not a young heart feels strange, nor old misgives: You scarcely can help thinking, that the sound Must pierce with sweetness to the very graves. But mark—not the whole week do we pass thus,— No, nor whole day. Heaven, for ease' sake forbid! Half of the day (and half of that might serve, Were all the world active and just as we) Is mix'd with the great throng, playing its part Of toil and pain; we could not relish else Our absolute comfort; nay, should almost fear Heav'n counted us not worthy to partake The common load with its great hopes for all, But held us flimsy triflers—gnats i' the sun— Made but for play, and so to die, unheav'n'd. Oh, hard we work, and carefully we think, And much we suffer! but the line being drawn 'Twixt work and our earth's heav'n, well do we draw it, Sudden, and sharp, and sweet; and in an instant Are borne away, like knights to fairy isles, And close our gates behind us on the world. “And where (cries some one) is this blessed spot? May I behold it? May I gain admittance?” Yes, with a thought;—as we do. “Woe is me! Then no such place exists!” None such to us, Except in thought; but that— “Is true as fiction?” Ay, true as tears or smiles that fiction makes, Waking the ready heaven in men's eyes;— True as effect to cause;—true as the hours You spend in joy while sitting at a play. Is there no truth in those? Or was your heart Happier before you went there? Oh, if rich In what you deem life's only solid goods, Think what unjoyous blanks ev'n those would be, Were fancy's light smitten from out your world, With all its colourings of your prides, your gains, Your very toys and tea-cups, nothing left But what you touch, and not what touches you. The wise are often rich in little else, The rich, if wise, count it their gold of gold. Say, is it not so, thou who art both rich In the world's eye, and wise in solitude's,— Stoneleigh's poetic lord, whose gentle name No echo granted at the font to mine, I trust, shall have made ruder. What would'st care, O Leigh, for all the wooden matter-o'-fact Of all thine oaks, depriv'd of what thy muse Can do to wake their old oracular breath, Or whisper, with their patriarch locks, of heaven? Lo! Southwood Smith, physician of mankind, Bringer of light and air to the rich poor Of the next age:—he, when in real woods He rests the mildest energy alive, Scorns not these fancied ones, but hails and loves A vision of the dawn of his own world. Horace Smith, lo! rare compound, skill'd alike In worldly gain and its unworldliest use: He prospers in the throng, makes fact his slave, Then leads a life with fiction and good deeds. Lo! Bulwer, genius in the thick of fame, With smiles of thrones, and echoes from the Rhine, He too extends his grounds to Fairy-land, And while his neighbours think they see him looking Hard at themselves, is in Armorica, Feasting with lovers in enchanted bowers. Lo! Jeffrey the fine wit, the judge revered, The man belov'd, what spirit invokes he To make his hasty moments of repose Richest and farthest off?—The Muse of Keats, One of the inmost dwellers in the core Of the old woods, when Nymphs and Graces liv'd,— Where still they live, to eyes, like theirs, divine. Fancy's the wealth of wealth, the toiler's hope, The poor man's piecer-out; the art of Nature, Painting her landscapes twice; the spirit of fact, As matter is the body; the pure gift Of heav'n to poet and to child; which he Who retains most in manhood, being a man In all things fitted else, is most a man; Because he wants no human faculty, Nor loses one sweet taste of the sweet world. A HEAVEN UPON EARTH. FRAGMENT OF AN UNPUBLISHED PLAY. A HUSBAND IS CONVERSING WITH HIS WIFE. For there are two heavens, sweet, Both made of love,—one, inconceivable Ev'n by the other, so divine it is; The other, far on this side of the stars, By men call'd home, when some blest pair are met As we are now: sometimes in happy talk, Sometimes in silence (also a sort of talk, Where friends are match'd) each at its gentle task Of book, or household need, or meditation, By summer-moon, or curtain'd fire in frost; And by degrees there come,—not always come, Yet mostly,—other, smaller inmates there, Cherubic-fac'd, yet growing like those two, Their pride and playmates, not without meek fear, Since God sometimes to his own cherubim Takes those sweet cheeks of earth. And so 'twixt joy, And love, and tears, and whatsoever pain Man fitly shares with man, these two grow old; And if indeed blest thoroughly, they die In the same spot, and nigh the same good hour, And setting suns look heavenly on their grave.— REFLECTIONS OF A DEAD BODY. Scene.—A female sitting by a bed-side, anxiously looking at the face of her husband, just dead. The soul within the dead body soliloquizes. What change is this! What joy! What depth of rest! What suddenness of withdrawal from all pain Into all bliss? into a balm so perfect I do not even smile! I tried but now, With that breath's end, to speak to the dear face That watches me—and lo! all in an instant, Instead of toil, and a weak, weltering tear, I am all peace, all happiness, all power, Laid on some throne in space.—Great God! I am dead. (A pause.) Dear God! thy love is perfect; thy truth known. (Another.) And he,—and they!—How simple and strange! How beautiful! But I may whisper it not,—even to thought; Lest strong imagination, hearing it, Speak, and the world be shatter'd. (Soul again pauses.) O balm! O bliss! O saturating smile Unsmiling! O doubt ended! certainty Begun! O will, faultless, yet all indulged, Encourag'd to be wilful;—to delay Even its wings for heav'n; and thus to rest Here, here, ev'n here,—'twixt heav'n and earth awhile, A bed in the morn of endless happiness. I feel warm drops falling upon my face: They reach me through the rapture of this cold.— My wife! my love!—'tis for the best thou canst not Know how I know thee weeping, and how fond A kiss meets thine in these unowning lips. Ah, truly was my love what thou didst hope it, And more; and so was thine—I read it all— And our small feuds were but impatiences At seeing the dear truth ill understood. Poor sweet! thou blamest now thyself, and heapest Memory on memory of imagin'd wrong, As I should have done too,—as all who love; And yet I cannot pity thee:—so well I know the end, and how thou'lt smile hereafter. She speaks my name at last, as though she fear'd The terrible, familiar sound; and sinks In sobs upon my bosom. Hold me fast, Hold me fast, sweet, and from the extreme grow calm,— Me, cruelly unmov'd, and yet how loving! How wrong I was to quarrel with poor James! And how dear Francis mistook me! That pride, How without ground it was! Those arguments, Which I suppos'd so final, oh how foolish! Yet gentlest death will not permit rebuke, Ev'n of one's self. They'll know all, as I know, When they lie thus. Colder I grow, and happier. Warmness and sense are drawing to a point, Ere they depart;—myself quitting myself. The soul gathers its wings upon the edge Of the new world, yet how assuredly! Oh! how in balm I change! actively will'd, Yet passive, quite; and feeling opposites mingle In exquisitest peace!—Those fleshly clothes, Which late I thought myself, lie more and more Apart from this warm, sweet, retreating me, Who am as a hand withdrawing from a glove. So lay my mother: so my father: so My children: yet I pitied them. I wept, And fancied them in graves, and call'd them “poor!” O graves! O tears! O knowledge, will, and time, And fear, and hope! what petty terms of earth Were ye! yet how I love ye as of earth, The planet's household words; and how postpone, Till out of these dear arms, th' immeasurable Tongue of the all-possessing smile eternal! Ah, not excluding these, nor aught that's past, Nor aught that's present, nor that's yet to come, Well waited for. I would not stir a finger Out of this rest, to reassure all anguish; Such warrant hath it; such divine conjuncture; Such a charm binds it with the needs of bliss. That was my eldest boy's—that kiss. And that The baby with its little unweening mouth; And those—and those—Dear hearts! they have all come, And think me dead—me, who so know I'm living, The vitalest creature in this fleshly room. I part; and with my spirit's eyes, full open'd, Will look upon them. [Spirit parts from the body, and breathes upon their eyes. Patient be those tears, Fresh heart-dews, standing on these dear clay-moulds Of souls made of myself,—made of us both In the half-heavenly time. I quit ye but To meet again, and will revisit soon In many a dream, and many a gentle sigh. [Spirit looks at the body. And was that me?—that hollow-cheek'd pale thing, Shatter'd with passions, worn with cares; now placid With my divine departure? And must love Think of thee painfully? of stifling boards 'Gainst the free face, and of the irreverent worm? To dust with thee, poor corpse! to dust and grass, And the glad innocent worm, that does its duty As thou dost thine in changing. I thy life, Life of thy life, bird of the bird, ah ha! Turn my face forth to heav'n—ah ha! ah ah! Oh the infinitude and the eternity! The dimpled air! the measureless conscious heaven! The endless possession! the sweet, mad, fawning planets [It speaks with a hurried vehemence of rapture. Sleeking, like necks, round the beatitudes of the ubiquitous sun-god With bee-music of innumerable organ thunders. And the travelling crowds this way, like a life-tempest, With rapid angelical faces, two in one, Ah ah! ah ha! and the stillness beyond the stars— My Friend! my Mother!—I mingle through the roar. [Spirit vanishes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miscellaneous Poems. POWER AND GENTLENESS. 1817. I've thought at gentle and ungentle hour, Of many an act and giant shape of power; Of the old kings with high exacting looks, Sceptred and globed; of eagles on their rocks, With straining feet, and that fierce mouth and drear, Answering the strain with downward drag austere; Of the rich-headed lion, whose huge frown All his great nature, gathering, seems to crown; Of towers on hills, with foreheads out of sight In clouds, or shown us by the thunder's light, Or ghastly prison, that eternally Holds its blind visage out to the lone sea; And of all sunless, subterranean deeps The creature makes, who listens while he sleeps, Avarice; and then of those old earthly cones, That stride, they say, over heroic bones; And those stone heaps Egyptian, whose small doors Look like low dens under precipitous shores; And him, great Memnon, that long sitting by In seeming idleness, with stony eye, Sang at the morning's touch, like poetry; And then, of all the fierce and bitter fruit Of the proud planting of a tyrannous foot,— Of bruised rights, and flourishing bad men, And virtue wasting heavenwards from a den; Brute force and fury; and the devilish drouth Of the fool cannon's ever-gaping mouth; And the bride-widowing sword; and the harsh bray The sneering trumpet sends across the fray; And all which lights the people-thinning star, That selfishness invokes,—the horsed war, Panting along with many a bloody mane. I've thought of all this pride, and all this pain, And all the insolent plenitudes of power, And I declare, by this most quiet hour, Which holds in different tasks by the fire-light Me and my friends here, this delightful night, That Power itself has not one half the might Of Gentleness. 'Tis want to all true wealth; The uneasy madman's force, to the wise health; Blind downward beating, to the eyes that see; Noise to persuasion, doubt to certainty; The consciousness of strength in enemies, Who must be strain'd upon, or else they rise; The battle to the moon, who all the while, High out of hearing, passes with her smile; The tempest, trampling in his scanty run, To the whole globe, that basks about the sun; Or as all shrieks and clangs, with which a sphere, Undone and fired, could rake the midnight ear, Compared with that vast dumbness nature keeps Throughout her starry deeps, Most old, and mild, and awful, and unbroken, Which tells a tale of peace beyond whate'er was spoken. THOUGHTS OF THE AVON. ON THE 28TH OF SEPTEMBER, 1817. It is the loveliest day that we have had This lovely month, sparkling and full of cheer; The sun has a sharp eye, yet kind and glad; Colours are doubly bright: all things appear Strong outlined in the spacious atmosphere; And through the lofty air the white clouds go, As on their way to some celestial show. The banks of Avon must look well to-day; Autumn is there in all his glory and treasure; The river must run bright; the ripples play Their crispest tunes to boats that rock at leisure; The ladies are abroad with cheeks of pleasure; And the rich orchards in their sunniest robes Are pouting thick with all their winy globes. And why must I be thinking of the pride Of distant bowers, as if I had no nest To sing in here, though by the houses' side? As if I could not in a minute rest In leafy fields, quiet, and self-possest, Having, on one side, Hampstead for my looks, On t'other, London, with its wealth of books? It is not that I envy autumn there, Nor the sweet river, though my fields have none; Nor yet that in its all-productive air Was born Humanity's divinest son, That sprightliest, gravest, wisest, kindest one— Shakespeare; nor yet, oh no—that here I miss Souls not unworthy to be named with his. No; but it is, that on this very day, And upon Shakespeare's stream, a little lower, Where, drunk with Delphic air, it comes away Dancing in perfume by the Peary Shore, Was born the lass that I love more and more: A fruit as fine as in the Hesperian store, Smooth, roundly smiling, noble to the core; An eye for art: a nature, that of yore Mothers and daughters, wives and sisters wore, When in the golden age one tune they bore; Marian,—who makes my heart and very rhymes run o'er. TO T. L. H. SIX YEARS OLD, DURING A SICKNESS. 1817. Sleep breathes at last from out thee, My little, patient boy; And balmy rest about thee Smooths off the day's annoy. I sit me down, and think Of all thy winning ways; Yet almost wish, with sudden shrink, That I had less to praise. Thy sidelong pillowed meekness, Thy thanks to all that aid, Thy heart, in pain and weakness, Of fancied faults afraid; The little trembling hand That wipes thy quiet tears, These, these are things that may demand Dread memories for years. Sorrows I've had, severe ones, I will not think of now; And calmly 'midst my dear ones Have wasted with dry brow; But when thy fingers press And pat my stooping head, I cannot bear the gentleness,— The tears are in their bed. Ah, first-born of thy mother, When life and hope were new, Kind playmate of thy brother, Thy sister, father too; My light, where'er I go, My bird, when prison-bound, My hand in hand companion,—no, My prayers shall hold thee round. To say “He has departed”— “His voice”—“his face”—is gone; To feel impatient-hearted, Yet feel we must bear on; Ah, I could not endure To whisper of such woe, Unless I felt this sleep ensure That it will not be so. Yes, still he's fixed, and sleeping! This silence too the while— Its very hush and creeping Seem whispering us a smile: Something divine and dim Seems going by one's ear, Like parting wings of Seraphim, Who say, “We've finished here.” TO J. H. FOUR YEARS OLD:—A NURSERY SONG. 1816. ? Pien d' amori, Pien di canti, e pien di fiori. Frugoni. Full of little loves for ours, Full of songs, and full of flowers. Ah little ranting Johnny, Forever blithe and bonny, And singing nonny, nonny, With hat just thrown upon ye; Or whistling like the thrushes With voice in silver gushes; Or twisting random posies With daisies, weeds, and roses; And strutting in and out so, Or dancing all about so, With cock-up nose so lightsome, And sidelong eyes so brightsome, And cheeks as ripe as apples, And head as rough as Dapple's, And arms as sunny shining As if their veins they'd wine in; And mouth that smiles so truly, Heav'n seems to have made it newly, It breaks into such sweetness With merry-lipp'd completeness;— Ah Jack, ah Gianni mio, As blithe as Laughing Trio, —Sir Richard, too, you rattler, So christened from the Tatler,— My Bacchus in his glory, My little Cor-di-fiori. My tricksome Puck, my Robin, Who in and out come bobbing, As full of feints and frolic as That fibbing rogue Autolycus, And play the graceless robber on Your grave-eyed brother Oberon,— Ah! Dick, ah Dolce-riso, How can you, can you be so? One cannot turn a minute, But mischief—there you're in it, A getting at my books, John, With mighty bustling looks, John; Or poking at the roses, In midst of which your nose is; Or climbing on a table, No matter how unstable, And turning up your quaint eye And half-shut teeth with “Mayn't I?” Or else you're off at play, John, Just as you'd be all day, John, With hat or not, as happens, And there you dance, and clap hands, Or on the grass go rolling, Or plucking flow'rs, or bowling, And getting me expenses With losing balls o'er fences; Or, as the constant trade is, Are fondled by the ladies With “What a young rogue this is!” Reforming him with kisses; Till suddenly you cry out, As if you had an eye out, So desperately tearful, The sound is really fearful; When lo! directly after, It bubbles into laughter. Ah rogue! and do you know, John, Why 'tis we love you so, John? And how it is they let ye Do what you like and pet ye, Though all who look upon ye, Exclaim, “Ah Johnny, Johnny!” It is because you please 'em Still more, John, than you tease 'em; Because, too, when not present, The thought of you is pleasant; Because, though such an elf, John, They think that if yourself, John, Had something to condemn too, You'd be as kind to them too; In short, because you're very Good-temper'd, Jack, and merry; And are as quick at giving, As easy at receiving; And in the midst of pleasure Are certain to find leisure To think, my boy, of ours, And bring us lumps of flowers. But see, the sun shines brightly; Come, put your hat on rightly, And we'll among the bushes, And hear your friends the thrushes; And see what flow'rs the weather Has render'd fit to gather; And, when we home must jog, you Shall ride my back, you rogue you, Your hat adorn'd with fine leaves, Horse-chestnut, oak, and vine-leaves; And so, with green o'erhead, John, Shall whistle home to bed, John. TO CHARLES LAMB. O thou, whom old Homer would call, were he living, Home-lover, thought-feeder, abundant-joke-giving; Whose charity springs from deep knowledge, nor swerves Into mere self-reflections, or scornful reserves; In short, who were made for two centuries ago, When Shakespeare drew men, and to write was to know;— You'll guess why I can't see the snow-covered streets, Without thinking of you and your visiting feats, When you call to remembrance how you and one more, When I wanted it most, used to knock at my door. For when the sad winds told us rain would come down, Or snow upon snow fairly clogged up the town, And dun yellow fogs brooded over its white, So that scarcely a being was seen towards night, Then, then said the lady yclept near and dear, “Now mind what I tell you, the Lambs will be here.” So I poked up the flame, and she got out the tea, And down we both sat, as prepared as could be; And there, sure as fate, came the knock of you two. Then the lantern, the laugh, and the “Well, how d'ye do?” Then your palm tow'rds the fire, and your face turn'd to me, And shawls and great-coats being—where they should be,— And due “never saw's” being paid to the weather, We cherished our knees, and sat sipping together, And leaving the world to the fogs and the fighters, Discussed the pretensions of all sorts of writers; Of Shakespeare's coëvals, all spirits divine; Of Chapman, whose Homer's a fine rough old wine; Of Marvell, wit, patriot, and poet, who knew How to give, both at once, Charles and Cromwell their due. Of Spenser, who wraps you, wherever you are, In a bow'r of seclusion beneath a sweet star; Of Richardson, too, who afflicts us so long, We begin to suspect him of nerves over strong; In short, of all those who give full-measur'd page, Not forgetting Sir Thomas, my ancestor sage, Who delighted (so happy were all his digestions) In puzzling his head with impossible questions. But now, Charles—you never (so blissful you deem me) Come lounging, with twirl of umbrella to see me. In vain have we hoped to be set at our ease By the rains which you know used to bring Lamb and pease; In vain we look out like the children in Thomson, And say, in our innocence, “Surely he'll come soon.” 'Tis true, I do live in a vale, at my will, With sward to my gateway, and trees on the hill: My health too gets on: and now autumn is nigh, The sun has come back, and there's really blue sky; But then, the late weather, I think, had its merits, And might have induc'd you to look at one's spirits; We hadn't much thunder and lightning, I own: But the rains might have led you to walk out of town; And what made us think your desertion still stranger, The roads were so bad, there was really some danger. EPISTLE TO WILLIAM HAZLITT. Et modo qua nostri spatiantur in urbe quirites, Et modo villarum proxima rura placent. —Milton, Eleg. 7. Enjoying now the range of town at ease, And now the neighbouring rural villages. Dear Hazlitt, whose tact intellectual is such, That it seems to feel truth, as pure matter of touch,— Who in politics, arts, metaphysics, poetics, To critics in these times, are health to cosmetics, And, nevertheless, or I rather should say, For that very reason,—can relish boy's play, And turning on all sides, through pleasures and cares, Find nothing more precious than laughs and fresh airs,— One's life, I conceive, might go prettily down, In a due easy mixture of country and town;— Not after the fashion of most with two houses, Who gossip, and gape, and just follow their spouses, And let their abode be wherever it will, Are the same vacant, house-keeping animals still;— But with due sense of each, and of all that it yields,— In the town, of the town,—in the fields, of the fields;— In the one, for example, to feel as we go on, That streets are about us, arts, people, and so on; In t'other, to value the stillness, the breeze, And love to see farms, and to get among trees. Each his liking, of course,—so that this be the rule.— For my part, who went in the city to school, And whenever I got in a field, felt my soul in it —Spring so, that like a young horse I could roll in it,— My inclinations are much what they were, And cannot dispense, in the first place, with air; But then I would have the most rural of nooks Just near enough town to make use of its books, And to walk there, whenever I chose to make calls, To look at the ladies, and lounge at the stalls. To tell you the truth, I could spend very well Whole mornings in this way 'twixt here and Pall Mall, And make my gloves' fingers as black as my hat, In pulling the books up from this stall and that:— Then turning home gently through field and o'er style, Partly reading a purchase, or rhyming the while, Take my dinner (to make a long evening) at two, With a few droppers-in, like my Cousin and you, Who can season the talk with the right-flavour'd Attic, Too witty, for tattling,—too wise, for dogmatic;— Then take down an author, whom one of us mentions, And doat, for a while, on his jokes or inventions; Then have Mozart touch'd, on our bottle's completion, Or one of your fav'rite trim ballads Venetian:— Then up for a walk before tea down a valley, And so to come back through a leafy-wall'd alley, In which the sun peeping, as into a chamber, Looks gold on the leaves, turning some to sheer amber: Then tea made by one, who (although my wife she be,) If Jove were to drink it, would soon be his Hebe; Then silence a little,—a creeping twilight,— Then an egg for your supper, with lettuces white, And a moon and friend's arm to go home with at night. Now this I call passing a few devout hours Becoming a world that has friendships and flowers; That has lips also, made for still more than to chat to; And if it has rain, has a rainbow for that too. “Lord bless us!” exclaims some old hunks in a shop, “What useless young dogs!” and falls combing a crop. “How idle!” another cries—“really a sin!” And starting up, takes his first customer in. “At least,” cries another, “it's nothing but pleasure;” Then longs for the Monday, quite sick of his leisure. “What toys!” cries the sage haggard statesman,—“what stuff!” Then fillips his ribbon, to shake off the snuff. “How profane!” cries the preacher, proclaiming his message; Then calls God's creation a vile dirty passage. “Lips too!” cries a vixen,—and fidgets, and stirs, And concludes (which is true) that I didn't mean hers. TO BARRON FIELD. Dear Field, my old friend, who love straightforward verse, And will take it, like marriage, for better, for worse,— Who cheered my fire-side, when we grew up together, And still warm my heart in these times and this weather; I know you'll be glad to see, under my hand, That I'm still, as the phrase is, alive in the land, When you hear, that since meeting the bright-eyed and witty, I've been asked to an absolute feast in the city! Yes, Barron, no more of the Nelsons and Jervises:— Dinner's the place for the hottest of services;— There's the array, and the ardour to win, The clashing, and splashing, and crashing, and din; With fierce intercepting of convoys of butter, And phrases and outcries tremendous to utter,— Blood, devils, and drum-sticks,—now cut it—the jowl there— Brains, bones, head and shoulders, and into the sole there! The veterans too, round you—how obviously brave! What wounds and what swellings they bear to their grave! Some red as a fever, some pallid as death, Some balustrade-legg'd, others panting for breath, Some jaundiced, some jaded, some almost a jelly, And numbers with horrid contusion of belly. No wonder the wise look on dinners like these, As so much sheer warfare with pain and disease. Indeed, you may see by the gestures and grins Which some dishes make, how they wait for one's sins;— The gape of a cod-fish, and round staring eye, The claws that threat up from a fierce pigeon pie,— Don't they warn us, with signs at which heroes might shiver. Of wounds in the midriff, and scars in the liver? Even hares become bold in so desperate a case, And with hollow defiance look full in one's face. This made, t'other day, a physician declare, That disease, bonâ fide, was part of our fare. For example, he held that a plate of green fruit Was not only substance, but colic to boot; That veal, besides making an exquisite dish, Was a fine indigestion, and so was salt-fish; That a tongue was most truly a thing to provoke, Hasty-pudding slow poison, and trifle no joke. Had you asked him accordingly, what was the fare, When he dined t'other day with the vicar or may'r, He'd have said, “Oh, of course, everything of the best, Gout, headache, and fever, and pain in the chest.” 'Twas thus too at table, when helping the meat, He'd have had you encourage the people to eat,— As “Pray, Sir, allow me,—a slice of this gout; I could get no St. Anthony's fire—it's quite out. Mr. P. there,—more nightmare? my hand's quite at leisure; A glass of slow fever? I'm sure with great pleasure. My dear Mrs. H., why your plate's always empty! Now can't a small piece of this agony tempt ye? And then leaning over, with spoon and with smile, Do let me, Miss Betsy,—a little more bile?— Have I no more persuasion with you too, Miss Virtue? A little, I'm sure, of this cough couldn't hurt you.” Now all this is good, and didactic enough For those who'd make bodies mere cushions to stuff: Excess is bad always;—but there's a relation Of this same Excess, sometimes called Moderation, Who wonders, and smiles, and concludes you a glutton, If helped more than he is to turnips and mutton;— A Southey in soups, who though changing his whim, Would still have your living take pattern by him;— In short, a Procrustes, who'd measure one's dishes, As t'other did beds, to his own size or wishes. Alas, we might ask every person we meet To talk just as we do, as well as to eat,— Enjoin the same rest to the brisk and tir'd out, One repair to all tenements, shatter'd or stout, One pay for all earnings, contents for all cases, Nay, quarrel with people for difference of faces, And turning beside us, with angry surprise, Say, “Why a'n't you like me, Sir,—nose, mouth, and eyes?” Each his ways, each his wants; and then taking our food, 'Tis exercise turns it to glad-flowing blood. We must shun, it is true, what we find doesn't suit With our special digestions,—wine, water, or fruit; But from all kinds of action one thing we may learn,— That nature'll indulge us, provided we earn. We study her fields, and find “books in the brooks;” We range them, ride, walk, and come safe from the cooks. Thus I look upon shoes whiten'd thickly with dust, As entitling the bearer to double pie-crust; A mere turnpike ticket's a passport to lamb; But a row up the Thames lands you safely at Ham. And now, after all, why this subject to you, To whom I am bidding a long, long adieu? Why, because not content with two dinners, you see, To take my leave of you, I needs must have three; And so have insidiously got you to be a True guest of a poet, and dine in idea. So here, in your old friend the Barmecide's glass, Is to you, dear Field, and your new-married lass. May a breath from blue heaven your vessel attend, As true to the last, as you've been to your friend; And may all meet again to grow young in our joys, And you and I, Barron, be happy old boys. ON HEARING A LITTLE MUSICAL BOX. Dilettevol' suoni Faceano intorno l' aria tintinnire D' armonia dolce, e di concenti buoni. Ariosto. Hallo!—what?—where, what can it be That strikes up so deliciously? I never in my life—what no! That little tin-box playing so? It really seemed as if a sprite Had struck among us, swift and light, And come from some minuter star To treat us with his pearl guitar. Hark! it scarcely ends the strain, But it gives it o'er again, Lovely thing!—and runs along, Just as if it knew the song, Touching out, smooth, clear and small, Harmony, and shake, and all, Now upon the treble lingering, Dancing now as if 'twere fingering, And at last upon the close, Coming with serene repose. O full of sweetness, crispness, ease, Compound of lovely smallnesses, Accomplished trifle,—tell us what To call thee, and disgrace thee not. Worlds of fancies come about us, Thrill within and glance without us. Now we think that there must be In thee some humanity, Such a taste composed and fine Smiles along that touch of thine. Now we call thee heavenly rain, For thy fresh, continued strain; Now a hail, that on the ground Splits into light leaps of sound; Now the concert, neat and nice, Of a pigmy paradise; Sprinkles then from singing fountains; Fairies heard on tops of mountains; Nightingales endued with art, Caught in listening to Mozart: Stars that make a distant tinkling, While their happy eyes are twinkling; Sounds for scattered rills to flow to; Music, for the flowers to blow to. HEARING MUSIC. (Set to music by Vincent Novello.) When lovely sounds about my ears Like winds in Eden's tree-tops rise, And make me, though my spirit hears, For very luxury close my eyes, Let none but friends be round about Who love the smoothing joy like me, That so the charm be felt throughout, And all be harmony. And when we reach the close divine, Then let the hand of her I love Come with its gentle palm on mine, As soft as snow or lighting dove; And let, by stealth, that more than friend Look sweetness in my opening eyes, For only so such dreams should end, Or wake in Paradise. THE LOVER OF MUSIC TO HIS PIANO-FORTE. Oh friend, whom glad or grave we seek, Heav'n-holding shrine! I ope thee, touch thee, hear thee speak, And peace is mine. No fairy casket full of bliss, Out-values thee: Love only, waken'd with a kiss, More sweet may be. To thee, when our full hearts o'erflow In griefs or joys, Unspeakable emotions owe A fitting voice: Mirth flies to thee, and Love's unrest, And Memory dear. And Sorrow, with his tighten'd breast, Comes for a tear. Oh since few joys of human mould Thus wait us still, Thrice bless'd be thine, thou gentle fold Of peace at will. No change, no sullenness, no cheat, In thee we find; Thy saddest voice is ever sweet,— Thine answer, kind. A THOUGHT OR TWO ON READING POMFRET'S “CHOICE.” 1823. I have been reading Pomfret's “Choice” this spring, A pretty kind of—sort of—kind of thing, Not much a verse, and poem none at all, Yet, as they say, extremely natural. And yet I know not. There's an art in pies, In raising crusts as well as galleries; And he's the poet, more or less, who knows The charm that hallows the least truth from prose, And dresses it in its mild singing clothes. Not oaks alone are trees, nor roses flowers; Much humble wealth makes rich this world of ours. Nature from some sweet energy throws up Alike the pine-mount and the buttercup; And truth she makes so precious, that to paint Either, shall shrine an artist like a saint, And bring him in his turn the crowds that press Round Guido's saints or Titian's goddesses. Our trivial poet hit upon a theme Which all men love, an old, sweet household dream:— Pray, reader, what is yours?—I know full well What sort of home should grace my garden-bell,— No tall, half-furnish'd, gloomy, shivering house, That worst of mountains labouring with a mouse; Nor should I choose to fill a tawdry niche in A Grecian temple, opening to a kitchen. The frogs in Homer should have had such boxes, Or Æsop's frog, whose heart was like the ox's. Such puff about high roads, so grand, so small, With wings and what not, portico and all, And poor drench'd pillars, which it seems a sin Not to mat up at night-time, or take in. I'd live in none of those. Nor would I have Veranda'd windows to forestall my grave; Veranda'd truly, from the northern heat! And cut down to the floor to comfort one's cold feet! My house should be of brick, more wide than high, With sward up to the path, and elm-trees nigh; A good old country lodge, half hid with blooms Of honied green, and quaint with straggling rooms, A few of which, white-bedded and well swept, For friends, whose name endear'd them, should be kept. The tip-toe traveller, peeping through the boughs O'er my low wall, should bless the pleasant house: And that my luck might not seem ill-bestow'd, A bench and spring should greet him on the road. My grounds should not be large. I like to go To Nature for a range, and prospect too, And cannot fancy she'd comprise for me, Even in a park, her all-sufficiency. Besides, my thoughts, fly far; and when at rest, Love, not a watch-tow'r, but a lulling nest. A Chiswick or a Chatsworth might, I grant, Visit my dreams with an ambitious want; But then I should be forced to know the weight Of splendid cares, new to my former state; And these 'twould far more fit me to admire, Borne by the graceful ease of noblest Devonshire. Such grounds, however, as I had, should look Like “something” still; have seats, and walks, and brook; One spot for flowers, the rest all turf and trees; For I'd not grow my own bad lettuces. I'd build a cover'd path too against rain, Long, peradventure, as my whole domain, And so be sure of generous exercise, The youth of age and med'cine of the wise. And this reminds me, that behind some screen About my grounds, I'd have a bowling-green; Such as in wits' and merry women's days Suckling preferr'd before his walk of bays. You may still see them, dead as haunts of fairies, By the old seats of Killigrews and Careys, Where all, alas! is vanish'd from the ring, Wits and black eyes, the skittles and the king! Fishing I hate, because I think about it, Which makes it right that I should do without it. A dinner, or a death, might not be much, But cruelty's a rod I dare not touch. I own I cannot see my right to feel For my own jaws, and tear a trout's with steel; To troll him here and there, and spike, and strain, And let him loose to jerk him back again. Fancy a preacher at this sort of work, Not with his trout or gudgeon, but his clerk: The clerk leaps gaping at a tempting bit, And, hah! an ear-ache with a knife in it! That there is pain and evil, is no rule That I should make it greater, like a fool; Or rid me of my rust so vile a way, As long as there's a single manly play. Nay, fool's a word my pen unjustly writes, Knowing what hearts and brains have dozed o'er “bites;” But the next inference to be drawn might be, That higher beings made a trout of me; Which I would rather should not be the case, Though “Izaak” were the saint to tear my face, And, stooping from his heaven with rod and line, Made the fell sport, with his old dreams divine, As pleasant to his taste, as rough to mine. Such sophistry, no doubt, saves half the hell, But fish would have preferr'd his reasoning well, And, if my gills concern'd him, so should I. The dog, I grant, is in that “equal sky;” But, heav'n be prais'd, he's not my deity. All manly games I'd play at,—golf and quoits, And cricket, to set lungs and limbs to rights, And make me conscious, with a due respect, Of muscles one forgets by long neglect. With these, or bowls aforesaid, and a ride, Books, music, friends, the day would I divide, Most with my family, but when alone, Absorb'd in some new poem of my own; A task which makes my time so richly pass, So like a sunshine cast through painted glass. (Save where poor Captain Sword crashes the panes,) That could my friends live too, and were the gains Of toiling men but freed from sordid fears, Well could I walk this earth a thousand years. SUDDEN FINE WEATHER. Reader! what soul that loves a verse, can see The spring return, nor glow like you and me? Hear the quick birds, and see the landscape fill, Nor long to utter his melodious will? This more than ever leaps into the veins, When spring has been delay'd by winds and rains, And coming with a burst, comes like a show, Blue all above, and basking green below, And all the people culling the sweet prime: Then issues forth the bee to clutch the thyme, And the bee poet rushes into rhyme. For lo! no sooner has the cold withdrawn, Than the bright elm is tufted on the lawn; The merry sap has run up in the bowers, And bursts the windows of the buds in flowers; With song the bosoms of the birds run o'er, The cuckoo calls, the swallow's at the door, And apple-trees at noon, with bees alive, Burn with the golden chorus of the hive. Now all these sweets, these sounds, this vernal blaze, Is but one joy, express'd a thousand ways: And honey from the flowers, and song from birds, Are from the poet's pen his overflowing words. Ah friends! methinks it were a pleasant sphere, If, like the trees, we blossom'd every year; If locks grew thick again, and rosy dyes Return'd in cheeks, and raciness in eyes, And all around us, vital to the tips, The human orchard laugh'd with cherry lips! Lord! what a burst of merriment and play, Fair dames, were that! and what a first of May! So natural is the wish, that bards gone by Have left it, all, in some immortal sigh! And yet the winter months were not so well: Who would like changing, as the seasons fell? Fade every year; and stare, midst ghastly friends, With falling hairs, and stuck-out fingers' ends? Besides, this tale of youth that comes again, Is no more true of apple-trees than men. The Swedish sage, the Newton of the flow'rs, Who first found out those worlds of paramours, Tells us, that every blossom that we see Boasts in its walls a separate family; So that a tree is but a sort of stand, That holds those filial fairies in its hand; Just as Swift's giant might have held a bevy Of Lilliputian ladies, or a levee. It is not he that blooms: it is his race, Who honour his old arms, and hide his rugged face. Ye wits and bards then, pray discern your duty, And learn the lastingness of human beauty. Your finest fruit to some two months may reach: I've known a cheek at forty like a peach. But see! the weather calls me. Here's a bee Comes bounding in my room imperiously, And talking to himself, hastily burns About mine ear, and so in heat returns. O little brethren of the fervid soul, Kissers of flowers, lords of the golden bowl, I follow to your fields and tusted brooks: Winter's the time to which the poet looks For hiving his sweet thoughts, and making honied books. ALTER ET IDEM. A CHEMICO-POETICAL THOUGHT. O Lovers, ye that poorly love, and ye That think ye love beyond sobriety, Twine me a wreath, if but for only this,— I'll prove the roses in the poet's kiss. Not metaphors alone are lips and roses, Whate'er the gallant or the churl supposes: Ask what compounds them both, and science tells Of marvellous results in crucibles,— Of common elements,—say two in five,— By which their touch is soft, their bloom's alive; So that the lip and leaf do really, both, Hold a shrewd cut of the same velvet cloth. The maxim holds, where'er the compounds fall,— In birds, in brooks, in wall-flowers and the wall: The beauty shares them with her very shawl. 'Tis true, the same things go to harden rocks; There's iron in the shade of Julia's locks; And when we kiss Jacintha's tears away, A briny pity melts in what we say: But read these common properties aright, And shame in love is quench'd, and wise delight. The very coarsest clay, the meanest shard That hides the beetle in the public yard, Shares with the stars, and all that rolls them on, Much more the face we love to look upon; And be the drops compounded as they may, That bring sweet sorrows from sweet eyes away, Where's the mean soul shall honour not the tears Shed for a lover's hopes, a mother's fears? Rise, truth and love, and vindicate my rhyme! The crabbed Scot, that once upon a time Ask'd what a poem prov'd, and just had wit To prove himself a fool, by asking it, E'en he had blood, as Burns or Wallace had, Or as the lip that makes a painter mad. AN ANGEL IN THE HOUSE. How sweet it were, if without feeble fright, Or dying of the dreadful beauteous sight, An angel came to us, and we could bear To see him issue from the silent air At evening in our room, and bend on ours His divine eyes, and bring us from his bowers News of dear friends, and children who have never Been dead indeed,—as we shall know forever. Alas! we think not what we daily see About our hearths,—angels, that are to be, Or may be if they will, and we prepare Their souls and ours to meet in happy air;— A child, a friend, a wife whose soft heart sings In unison with ours, breeding its future wings. WEALTH AND WOMANHOOD. Have you seen an heiress In her jewels mounted, Till her wealth and she seem'd one, And she might be counted? Have you seen a bosom With one rose betwixt it? And did you mark the grateful blush, While the bridegroom fix'd it? A HYMN TO BISHOP ST. VALENTINE. The day, the only day returns, The true redde letter day returns, When summer time in winter burns; When a February dawn Is open'd by two sleeves in lawn Fairer than Aurora's fingers, And a burst of all bird singers, And a shower of billet-doux, Tinging cheeks with rosy hues, And over all a face divine, Face good-natured, face most fine, Face most anti-saturnine, Even thine, yea, even thine, Saint of sweethearts, Valentine! See, he's dawning! See, he comes With the jewels on his thumbs Glancing us a ruby ray (For he's sun and all to-day)! See his lily sleeves! and now See the mitre on his brow! See his truly pastoral crook, And beneath his arm his book (Some sweet tome De Arte Amandi): And his hair, 'twixt saint and dandy, Lovelocks touching either cheek, And black, though with a silver streak, As though for age both young and old, And his look, 'twixt meek and bold, Bowing round on either side, Sweetly lipp'd and earnest eyed, And lifting still, to bless the land, His very gentlemanly hand. Hail! oh hail! and thrice again Hail, thou clerk of sweetest pen! Connubialest of clergymen! Exquisite bishop!—not at all Like Bishop Bonner; no, nor Hall, That gibing priest; nor Atterbury, Although he was ingenious, very, And wrote the verses on the “Fan;” But then he swore,—unreverend man! But very like good Bishop Berkeley, Equally benign and clerkly; Very like Rundle, Shipley, Hoadley, And all the genial of the godly; Like De Sales, and like De Paul; But most, I really think, of all, Like Bishop Mant, whose sweet theology Includeth verse and ornithology, And like a proper rubric star, Hath given us a new “Calendar,” So full of flowers and birdly talking, 'Tis like an Eden bower to walk in. Such another See is thine, O thou Bishop Valentine; Such another, but as big To that, as Eden to a fig; For all the world's thy diocese, All the towns and all the trees, And all the barns and villages: The whole rising generation Is thy loving congregation: Enviable's indeed thy station; Tithes cause thee no reprobation, Dean and chapter's no vexation, Heresy no spoliation. Begg'd is thy participation; No one wishes thee translation, Except for some sweet explanation. All decree thee consecration! Beatification! Canonization! All cry out, with heart-prostration, Sweet's thy text-elucidation, Sweet, oh sweet's thy visitation, And Paradise thy confirmation. TO MAY. May, thou month of rosy beauty, Month, when pleasure is a duty; Month of maids that milk the kine, Bosom rich, and breath divine; Month of bees, and month of flowers, Month of blossom-laden bowers; Month of little hands with daisies, Lovers' love, and poets' praises; O thou merry month complete, May, thy very name is sweet! May was maid in olden times, And is still in Scottish rhymes; May's the blooming hawthorn bough; May's the month that's laughing now. I no sooner write the word, Than it seems as though it heard, And looks up, and laughs at me, Like a sweet face rosily,— Like an actual colour bright, Flushing from the paper's white; Like a bride that knows her power, Started in a summer bower. If the rains that do us wrong Come to keep the winter long, And deny us thy sweet looks, I can love thee, sweet, in books, Love thee in the poets' pages, Where they keep thee green for ages; Love and read thee, as a lover Reads his lady's letters over, Breathing blessings on the art, Which commingles those that part. There is May in books forever; May will part from Spenser never; May's in Milton, May's in Prior, May's in Chaucer, Thomson, Dyer; May's in all the Italian books; She has old and modern nooks, Where she sleeps with nymphs and elves In happy places they call shelves, And will rise, and dress your rooms With a drapery thick with blooms. Come, ye rains then, if ye will, May's at home, and with me still: But come rather, thou, good weather, And find us in the fields together. TO JUNE. May's a word 'tis sweet to hear, Laughter of the budding year; Sweet it is to start, and say On May-morning, “This is May!” But there also breathes a tune— Hear it—in the sound of “June.” June's a month, and June's a name, Never yet hath had its fame. Summer's in the sound of June, Summer, and a deepen'd tune Of the bees and of the birds,— And of loitering lover's words,— And the brooks that, as they go, Seem to think aloud, yet low; And the voice of early heat, Where the mirth-spun insects meet; And the very colour's tone Russet now, and fervid grown; All a voice, as if it spoke Of the brown wood's cottage smoke, And the sun, and bright green oak. O come quickly, show thee soon, Come at once with all thy noon, Manly, joyous, gipsy June. May, the jade, with her fresh cheek And the love the bards bespeak, May, by coming first in sight, Half defrauds thee of thy right, For her best is shared by thee With a wealthier potency, So that thou dost bring us in A sort of May-time masculine, Fit for action or for rest, As the luxury seems the best, Bearding now the morning breeze, Or in love with paths of trees, Or dispos'd, full length, to lie With a hand-enshaded eye On thy warm and golden slopes, Basker in the buttercups, Listening with nice distant ears To the shepherd's clapping shears, Or the next field's laughing play In the happy wars of hay, While its perfume breathes all over, Or the bean comes fine or clover. O could I walk round the earth, With a heart to share my mirth, With a look to love me ever, Thoughtful much, but sullen never, I could be content to see June and no variety; Loitering here, and living there, With a book and frugal fare, With a finer gipsy time, And a cuckoo in the clime, Work at morn, and mirth at noon, And sleep beneath the sacred moon. CHRISTMAS. A SONG FOR THE YOUNG AND THE WISE. Christmas comes! He comes, he comes, Usher'd with a rain of plums; Hollies in the windows greet him; Schools come driving post to meet him; Gifts precede him, bells proclaim him, Every mouth delights to name him; Wet, and cold, and wind, and dark, Make him but the warmer mark; And yet he comes not one-embodied, Universal 's the blithe godhead, And in every festal house Presence hath ubiquitous. Curtains, those snug room-enfolders, Hang upon his million shoulders. And he has a million eyes Of fire, and eats a million pies, And is very merry and wise; Very wise and very merry, And loves a kiss beneath the berry. Then full many a shape hath he, All in said ubiquity: Now is he a green array, And now an “eve,” and now a “day;” Now he's town gone out of town, And now a feast in civic gown, And now the pantomime and clown With a crack upon the crown, And all sorts of tumbles down; And then he's music in the night, And the money gotten by't: He's a man that can't write verses, Bringing some to ope your purses; He's a turkey, he's a goose, He's oranges unfit for use; He's a kiss that loves to grow Underneath the mistletoe; And he's forfeits, cards, and wassails, And a king and queen with vassals, All the “quizzes” of the time Drawn and quarter'd with a rhyme; And then, for their revival's sake, Lo! he's an enormous cake, With a sugar on the top Seen before in many a shop, Where the boys could gaze forever, They think the cake so very clever. Then, some morning, in the lurch Leaving romps, he goes to church, Looking very grave and thankful, After which he's just as prankful, Now a saint, and now a sinner, But, above all, he's a dinner; He's a dinner, where you see Everybody's family; Beef, and pudding, and mince-pies, And little boys with laughing eyes, Whom their seniors ask arch questions, Feigning fears of indigestions (As if they, forsooth, the old ones, Hadn't privately, tenfold ones): He's a dinner and a fire, Heap'd beyond your hearts' desire— Heap'd with log, and bak'd with coals, Till it roasts your very souls, And your cheek the fire outstares, And you all push back your chairs, And the mirth becomes too great, And you all sit up too late, Nodding all with too much head, And so go off to too much bed. O plethora of beef and bliss! Monkish feaster, sly of kiss! Southern soul in body Dutch! Glorious time of great Too-Much! Too much heat, and too much noise, Too much babblement of boys; Too much eating, too much drinking, Too much ev'rything but thinking; Solely bent to laugh and stuff, And trample upon base Enough; Oh, right is thy instinctive praise Of the wealth of Nature's ways. Right thy most unthrifty glee, And pious thy mince-piety! For behold! great Nature's self Builds her no abstemious shelf, But provides (her love is such For all) her own great, good Too-Much,— Too much grass, and too much tree, Too much air, and land, and sea, Too much seed of fruit and flower, And fish, an unimagin'd dower! (In whose single roe shall be Life enough to stock the sea— Endless ichthyophagy!) Ev'ry instant through the day Worlds of life are thrown away; Worlds of life, and worlds of pleasure, Not for lavishment of treasure, But because she's so immensely Rich, and loves us so intensely, She would have us, once for all, Wake at her benignant call, And all grow wise, and all lay down Strife, and jealousy, and frown, And, like the sons of one great mother, Share, and be blest, with one another. RONDEAU. Jenny kiss'd me when we met, Jumping from the chair she sat in; Time, you thief, who love to get Sweets into your list, put that in: Say I'm weary, say I'm sad, Say that health and wealth have miss'd me, Say I'm growing old, but add, Jenny kiss'd me. BURNS AND TULLOCHGORUM. Come, let us have a dance, and make The mirth complete for Burns's sake, For how can feet not long to take The steps he took before 'em? Who, who, can keep them ever still, Who can keep them, who can keep them, Who can keep them ever still, When strong the will comes o'er 'em? Who can keep them ever still, When song itself shall urge the will, And music grind, like any mill, The reel of Tullochgorum? “O, Tullochgorum's my delight,” Said Burns's fine old herald, hight The Reverend Mr. Skinner, wight That hated false decorum: It was his, and Burns's too, His and Burns's, his and Burns's, It was his, and Burns's too, And all such true virorum: It was his, and Burns's too, And doubly thus becomes his due From all that ever shake a shoe At sound of Tullochgorum. For Tullochgorum's such a dance, As never yet was found in France, Though some French dames, whose sons could prance, To Scottish husbands bore 'em: Mirth it has and muscle both, Mirth and muscle, mirth and muscle, Mirth it has, and muscle both, And graces angelorum: Mirth it has and muscle both, And makes all friends, as Skinner show'th: Quakers themselves would take an oath, There's nought like Tullochgorum. 'Twas in this dance, there's not a doubt, The poet's Jane first twined about His heart, when footing in and out, Her charms made eyes adore 'em: She was a singing, dancing jade, Singing, dancing, singing, dancing, She was a singing, dancing jade, And full of grace flexorum: She was a singing, dancing jade, And nought beside; so Envy said; But capital good wife she made, Inspired by Tullochgorum. Who better could have played his part, In such a dance, than he whose art Of pleasing was all life and heart, And no fatigue could floor 'em? Think, lads and lasses, how he bad Lads and lasses, lads and lasses, Think, lads and lasses, how he bad Your loves all truthward soar 'em: Think how he made kind natures glad, And only brutes and bigots sad, Then, if you can, don't dance like mad The reel of Tullochgorum. LOVE-LETTERS MADE OF FLOWERS. ON A PRINT OF ONE OF THEM IN A BOOK. An exquisite invention this, Worthy of Love's most honied kiss, This art of writing billet-doux In buds, and odours, and bright hues! In saying all one feels and thinks In clever daffodils and pinks; In puns of tulips; and in phrases, Charming for their truth, of daisies; Uttering, as well as silence may, The sweetest words the sweetest way. How fit too for the lady's bosom! The place where billet-doux repose 'em. What delight, in some sweet spot Combining love with garden plot, At once to cultivate one's flowers And one's epistolary powers! Growing one's own choice words and fancies In orange tubs, and beds of pansies; One's sighs and passionate declarations In odorous rhetoric of carnations; Seeing how far one's stocks will reach; Taking due care one's flowers of speech To guard from blight as well as bathos, And watering, every day, one's pathos! A letter comes, just gather'd. We Dote on its tender brilliancy; Inhale its delicate expressions Of balm and pea, and its confessions Made with as sweet a Maiden's Blush As ever morn bedew'd on bush, ('Tis in reply to one of ours, Made of the most convincing flowers,) Then after we have kiss'd its wit And heart, in water putting it, (To keep its remarks fresh,) go round Our little eloquent plot of ground, And with enchanted hands compose Our answer all of lily and rose, Of tuberose and of violet, And Little Darling (Mignonette) Of Look at me and Call me to you, (Words that while they greet, go through you), Of Thoughts, of Flames, Forget-me-not, Bridewort,—in short, the whole blest lot Of vouchers for a life-long kiss, And literally, breathing bliss. SONGS AND CHORUS OF THE FLOWERS. ROSES. We are blushing Roses, Bending with our fulness, 'Midst our close-capp'd sister buds, Warming the green coolness. Whatsoe'er of beauty Yearns and yet reposes, Blush, and bosom, and sweet breath, Took a shape in roses. Hold one of us lightly,— See from what a slender Stalk we bow'r in heavy blooms, And roundness rich and tender. Know you not our only Rival flow'r—the human? Loveliest weight on lightest foot, Joy-abundant woman? LILIES. We are Lilies fair, The flower of virgin light; Nature held us forth, and said, “Lo! my thoughts of white.” Ever since then, angels Hold us in their hands; You may see them where they take In pictures their sweet stands. Like the garden's angels Also do we seem, And not the less for being crown'd With a golden dream. Could you see around us The enamour'd air, You would see it pale with bliss To hold a thing so fair. VIOLETS. We are violets blue, For our sweetness found Careless in the mossy shades, Looking on the ground. Love's dropp'd eyelids and a kiss,— Such our breath and blueness is. Io, the mild shape Hidden by Jove's fears, Found us first i' the sward, when she For hunger stoop'd in tears. “Wheresoe'er her lip she sets,” Jove said, “be breaths call'd Violets.” SWEET-BRIAR. Wild-rose, Sweet-briar, Eglantine, All these pretty names are mine, And scent in every leaf is mine, And a leaf for all is mine, And the scent—oh, that's divine! Happy-sweet and pungent-fine, Pure as dew, and pick'd as wine. As the rose in gardens dress'd Is the lady self-possess'd, I'm the lass in simple vest, The country lass whose blood's the best. Were the beams that thread the briar In the morn with golden fire Scented too, they'd smell like me, All Elysian pungency. POPPIES. We are slumberous poppies, Lords of Lethe downs, Some awake, and some asleep, Sleeping in our crowns. What perchance our dreams may know, Let our serious beauty show. Central depth of purple, Leaves more bright than rose, Who shall tell what brightest thought Out of darkest grows? Who, through what funereal pain Souls to love and peace attain? Visions aye are on us, Unto eyes of power, Pluto's always setting sun, And Proserpine's bower: There, like bees, the pale souls come For our drink with drowsy hum. Taste, ye mortals, also; Milky-hearted, we; Taste, but with a reverent care; Active-patient be. Too much gladness brings to gloom Those who on the gods presume. SONGS OF THE FLOWERS. We are the sweet Flowers, Born of sunny showers, Think, whene'er you see us, what our beauty saith: Utterance mute and bright Of some unknown delight, We fill the air with pleasure, by our simple breath: All who see us, love us; We befit all places; Unto sorrow we give smiles; and unto graces, graces. Mark our ways, how noiseless All, and sweetly voiceless, Though the March winds pipe to make our passage clear; Not a whisper tells Where our small seed dwells, Nor is known the moment green, when our tips appear. We thread the earth in silence, In silence build our bowers, And leaf by leaf in silence show, till we laugh atop, sweet Flowers! The dear lumpish baby, Humming with the May-bee, Hails us with his bright stare, stumbling through the grass; The honey-dropping moon, On a night in June, Kisses our pale pathway leaves, that felt the bridegroom pass. Age, the wither'd clinger, On us mutely gazes, And wraps the thought of his last bed in his childhood's daisies. See, and scorn all duller Taste, how heav'n loves colour, How great Nature, clearly, joys in red and green; What sweet thoughts she thinks Of violets and pinks, And a thousand flushing hues, made solely to be seen; See her whitest lilies Chill the silver showers, And what a red mouth has her rose, the woman of the flowers! Uselessness divinest Of a use the finest Painteth us, the teachers of the end of use; Travellers weary-eyed Bless us far and wide; Unto sick and prison'd thoughts we give sudden truce; Not a poor town window Loves its sickliest planting, But its wall speaks loftier truth than Babylon's whole vaunting. Sage are yet the uses Mix'd with our sweet juices Whether man or may-fly profit of the balm; As fair fingers heal'd Knights from the olden field, We hold cups of mightiest force to give the wildest calm. E'en the terror Poison Hath its plea for blooming; Life it gives to reverent lips, though death to the presuming. And oh! our sweet soul-taker, That thief the honey-maker, What a house hath he, by the thymy glen! In his talking rooms How the feasting fumes, Till his gold cups overflow to the mouths of men! The butterflies come aping Those fine thieves of ours, And flutter round our rifled tops, like tickled flowers with flowers. See those tops, how beauteous! What fair service duteous Round some idol waits, as on their lord the Nine? Elfin court 'twould seem; And taught perchance that dream, Which the old Greek mountain dreamt upon nights divine. To expound such wonder Human speech avails not: Yet there dies no poorest weed, that such a glory exhales not. Think of all these treasures, Matchless works and pleasures, Every one a marvel, more than thought can say; Then think in what bright show'rs We thicken fields and bowers, And with what heaps of sweetness half stifle wanton May: Think of the mossy forests By the bee-birds haunted, And all those Amazonian plains, lone lying as enchanted. Trees themselves are ours; Fruits are born of flowers; Peach and roughest nut were blossoms in the spring; The lusty bee knows well The news, and comes pell-mell, And dances in the bloomy thicks with darksome antheming. Beneath the very burthen Of planet-pressing ocean We wash our smiling cheeks in peace, a thought for meek devotion. Tears of Phœbus,—missings Of Cytherea's kissings, Have in us been found, and wise men find them still; Drooping grace unfurls Still Hyacinthus' curls, And Narcissus loves himself in the selfish rill; Thy red lip, Adonis, Still is wet with morning; And the step that bled for thee, the rosy briar adorning. Oh, true things are fables, Fit for sagest tables, And the flowers are true things, yet no fables they; Fables were not more Bright, nor lov'd of yore, Yet they grew not, like the flow'rs, by every old pathway. Grossest hand can test us; Fools may prize us never; Yet we rise, and rise, and rise, marvels sweet for ever. Who shall say that flowers Dress not heav'n's own bowers? Who its love, without them, can fancy,—or sweet floor? Who shall even dare To say we sprang not there, And came not down that Love might bring one piece of heav'n the more? Oh pray believe that angels From those blue dominions Brought us in their white laps down, 'twixt their golden pinions. ALBUMS. LINES WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM OF ROTHA QUILLINAN. An Album! This! Why, 'tis for aught I see, Sheer wit, and verse, and downright poetry; A priceless book incipient; a treasure Of growing pearl; a hoard for pride and pleasure; A golden begging-box, which pretty Miss Goes round with, like a gipsy as she is, From bard to bard, to stock her father's shelf, Perhaps for cunning dowry to herself. Albums are records, kept by gentle dames, To show us that their friends can write their names; That Miss can draw, or brother John can write “Sweet lines,” or that they know a Mr. White. The lady comes, with lowly grace upon her, “'Twill be so kind,” and “do her book such honour;” We bow, smile, deprecate, protest, read o'er The names to see what has been done before, Wish to say something wonderful, but can't, And write, with modest glory, “William Grant.” Johnson succeeds, and Thomson, Jones, and Clarke, And Cox with an original remark Out of the Speaker;—then come John's “sweet lines,” Fanny's “sweet airs,” and Jenny's “sweet designs:” Then Hobbs, Cobbs, Dobbs, Lord Strut, and Lady Brisk, And, with a flourish underneath him, Fisk. Alas! why sit I here, committing jokes On social pleasures and good-humour'd folks, That see far better with their trusting eyes, Than all the blinkings of the would-be wise? Albums are, after all, pleasant inventions, Make friends more friendly, grace one's good intentions, Brighten dull names, give great ones kinder looks, Nay, now and then produce right curious books, And make the scoffer (as it now does me) Blush to look round on deathless company. ULTRA-GERMANO-CRITICASTERISM. 1846. Would you make blazes Of ultra-reflectiveness, Get a few phrases Of ob and sub-jectiveness. Take for your subject The art of some poet, And be your whole object To show that you know it. Make all you read on him Seem what you thought of it: Palm your own creed on him, Though he knew nought of it. Rave on “æsthetics,” “Profundity,” “purity;” Damn the dull critics, And die of obscurity. BODRYDDAN. TO THE MEMORY OF B. Y. AND A. M. D. 1836. Our fairest dreams are made of truths, Nymphs are sweet women, angels youths, And Eden was an earthly bower: Not that the heavens are false;—oh no! But that the sweetest thoughts that grow In earth, must have an earthly flower: Blest, if they know how sweet they are, And that earth also is a star. I met a lady by the sea, A heart long known, a face desir'd, Who led me with sweet breathful glee To one that sat retir'd;— That sat retir'd in reverend chair, That younger lady's pride and care, Fading heav'nward beauteously In a long-drawn life of love, With smiles below and thoughts above: And round her play'd that fairy she, Like Impulse by Tranquillity. And truly might they, in times old, Have deem'd her one of fairy mould Keeping some ancestral queen Deathless, in a bow'r serene; For oft she might be noticed walking Where the seas at night were talking; Or extracting with deep look Power from out some learned book; Or with pencil or with pen Charming the rapt thoughts of men: And her eyes! they were so bright, They seemed to dance with elfin light, Playmates of pearly smiles, and yet So often and so sadly wet, That Pity wonder'd to conceive How lady so belov'd could grieve. And oft would both those ladies rare, Like enchantments out of air, In a sudden show'r descend Of balm on want, or flow'rs on friend; No matter how remote the place, For fairies laugh at time and space. From their hearts the gifts were given, As the light leaps out of heaven. Their very house was fairy:—none Might find it without favour won For some great zeal, like errant-knight, Or want and sorrow's holy right; And then they reach'd it by long rounds Of lanes between thick pastoral grounds Nest-like, and alleys of old trees, Until at last, in lawny ease, Down by a garden and its fountains, In the ken of mild blue mountains, Rose, as if exempt from death, Its many-centuried household breath. The stone-cut arms above the door Were such as earliest chieftains bore, Of simple gear, long laid aside; And low it was, and warm and wide,— A home to love, from sire to son, By white-grown servants waited on. Here a door opening breath'd of bowers Of ladies, who lead lives of flowers; There, walls were books; and the sweet witch, Painting, had there the rooms made rich With knights, and dames, and loving eyes Of heav'n-gone kindred, sweet and wise; Of bishops, gentle as their lawn, And sires, whose talk was one May-dawn. Last, on the roof, a clock's old grace Look'd forth, like some enchanted face That never slept, but in the night Dinted the air with thoughtful might Of sudden tongue which seem'd to say, “The stars are firm, and hold their way.” Behold me now, like knight indeed, Whose balmed wound had ceas'd to bleed, Behold me in this green domain Leading a palfrey by the rein, On which the fairy lady sat In magic talk, which men call “chat,” Over mead, up hill, down dale, While the sweet thoughts never fail, Bright as what we pluck'd 'twixt whiles, The mountain-ash's thick red smiles; And aye she laugh'd, and talk'd, and rode, And to blest eyes her visions show'd Of nook, and tow'r, and mountain rare, Like bosom, making mild the air; And seats, endear'd by friend and sire, Facing sunset's thoughtful fire. And then, to make romances true, Before this lady open flew A garden gate; and lo! right in, Where horse's foot had never been, Rode she! the gard'ner with a stare To see her threat his lilies fair, Uncapp'd his bent old silver hair, And seem'd to say, “My lady good Makes all things right in her sweet mood.” O land of Druid and of Bard, Worthy of bearded Time's regard, Quick-blooded, light-voiced, lyric Wales, Proud with mountains, rich with vales, And of such valour that in thee Was born a third of chivalry. (And is to come again, they say, Blowing its trumpets into day, With sudden earthquake from the ground, And in the midst, great Arthur crown'd,) I used to think of thee and thine As one of an old faded line Living in his hills apart, Whose pride I knew, but not his heart: But now that I have seen thy face, Thy fields, and ever youthful race, And women's lips of rosiest word (So rich they open), and have heard The harp still leaping in thy halls, Quenchless as the waterfalls, I know thee full of pulse as strong As the sea's more ancient song, And of a sympathy as wide; And all this truth, and more beside, I should have known, had I but seen, O Flint, thy little shore; and been Where Truth and Dream walk, hand-in-hand, Bodryddan's living Fairy-land. A NIGHT-RAIN IN SUMMER. June 28, 1834. Open the window, and let the air Freshly blow upon face and hair, And fill the room, as it fills the night, With the breath of the rain's sweet might. Hark! the burthen, swift and prone! And how the odorous limes are blown! Stormy Love's abroad, and keeps Hopeful coil for gentle sleeps. Not a blink shall burn to-night In my chamber, of sordid light; Nought will I have, not a window-pane, 'Twixt me and the air and the great good rain, Which ever shall sing me sharp lullabies; And God's own darkness shall close mine eyes; And I will sleep, with all things blest, In the pure earth-shadow of natural rest. CALVIULTOR. WRITTEN IN THE PERSON OF A BALD MAN. I've got my wig:—and now, thou rash Hirsutus, Crinitus, Whiskerandos, Ogre, Bear, Or whatsoever title please thine hair, Why vex the bald? Why loveless thus repute us? Sweet Shakspeare, omni nectare imbutus, Was bald; and he, the wise beyond compare, Socrates, teacher of the young and fair; And Cæsar, victim of a natural Brutus! Fresh is the bald man's head; for love so apt, That England's gallants, in her wittiest time, In voluntary baldness, velvet-capp'd, Through reams of letters urg'd their amorous rhyme: Then issued forth, peruk'd: and o'er their shoulders From every curl shook loves at all their fair beholders. TO THE QUEEN. AN OFFERING OF GRATITUDE ON HER MAJESTY'S BIRTHDAY. The lark dwells lowly, Madam,—on the ground,— And yet his song within the heavens is found: The basest heel may wound him ere he rise, But soar he must, for love exalts his eyes. Though poor, his heart must loftily be spent, And he sings free, crown'd with the firmament. A poet thus (if love and later fame May warrant him to wear that sacred name) Hoped, in some pause of birth-day pomp and power, His carol might have reach'd the Sovereign's bower; Voice of a heart twice touch'd; once in its need, Once by a kind word, exquisite indeed: But Care, ungrateful to a host that long Had borne him kindly, came and marr'd his song, Marr'd it, and stopp'd, and in his envious soul Dreamt it had ceas'd outright, and perish'd whole. Dull god! to know not, after all he knew, What the best gods, Patience and Love, can do. The song was lamed, was lated, yet the bird High by the lady's bower has still been heard, Thanking that balm in need, and that delightful word. Blest be the queen! Blest when the sun goes down; When rises, blest. May love line soft her crown. May music's self not more harmonious be, Than the mild manhood by her side and she. May she be young forever—ride, dance, sing, 'Twixt cares of state carelessly carolling, And set all fashions healthy, blithe, and wise, From whence good mothers and glad offspring rise. May everybody love her. May she be As brave as will, yet soft as charity; And on her coins be never laurel seen, But only those fair peaceful locks serene, Beneath whose waving grace first mingle now The ripe Guelph cheek and good straight Coburgh brow, Pleasure and reason! May she, every day, See some new good winning its gentle way By means of mild and unforbidden men! And when the sword hath bow'd beneath the pen, May her own line a patriarch scene unfold, As far surpassing what these days behold E'en in the thunderous gods, iron and steam, As they the sceptic's doubt, or wild man's dream! And to this end—oh! to this Christian end, And the sure coming of its next great friend, May her own soul, this instant, while I sing, Be smiling, as beneath some angel's wing, O'er the dear life in life, the small, sweet, new, Unselfish self, the filial self of two, Bliss of her future eyes, her pillow'd gaze, On whom a mother's heart thinks close, and prays. Your beadsman, Madam, thus, “in spite of sorrow,” Bids at your window, like the lark, good morrow. TO THE INFANT PRINCESS ROYAL. Welcome, bud beside the rose, On whose stem our safety grows; Welcome, little Saxon Guelph; Welcome for thine own small self; Welcome for thy father, mother, Proud the one and safe the other; Welcome to three kingdoms; nay, Such is thy potential day, Welcome, little mighty birth, To our human star the earth. Some have wish'd thee boy; and some Gladly wait till boy shall come, Counting it a genial sign When a lady leads the line. What imports it, girl or boy? England's old historic joy Well might be content to see Queens alone come after thee,— Twenty visions of thy mother Following sceptred, each the other, Linking with their roses white Ages of unborn delight. What imports it who shall lead, So that the good line succeed? So that love and peace feel sure Of old hate's discomfiture? Thee appearing by the rose Safety comes, and peril goes; Thee appearing, earth's new spring Fears no winter's “grisly king;” Hope anew leaps up, and dances In the hearts of human chances: France, the brave, but too quick-blooded, Wisely has her threat re-studied; England now, as safe as she From the strifes that need not be, And the realms thus hush'd and still, Earth with fragrant thought may fill, Growing harvests of all good, Day by day, as planet should, Till it clap its hands, and cry, Hail, matur'd humanity! Earth has outgrown want and war; Earth is now no childish star. But behold, where thou dost lie, Heeding nought, remote or nigh! Nought of all the news we sing Dost thou know, sweet ignorant thing; Nought of planet's love, nor people's: Nor dost hear the giddy steeples Carolling of thee and thine, As if heav'n had rain'd them wine; Nor dost care for all the pains Of ushers and of chamberlains, Nor the doctor's learned looks, Nor the very bishop's books, Nor the lace that wraps thy chin, No, nor for thy rank, a pin. E'en thy father's loving hand Nowise dost thou understand, When he makes thee feebly grasp His finger with a tiny clasp; Nor dost know thy very mother's Balmy bosom from another's, Though thy small blind lips pursue it, Nor the arms that draw thee to it, Nor the eyes, that, while they fold thee, Never can enough behold thee. Mother true and good has she, Little strong one, been to thee, Nor with listless in-door ways Weaken'd thee for future days; But has done her strenuous duty To thy brain and to thy beauty, Till thou cam'st, a blossom bright, Worth the kiss of air and light; To thy healthy self a pleasure; To the world a balm and treasure. THREE VISIONS, OCCASIONED BY THE BIRTH AND CHRISTENING OF THE PRINCE OF WALES. O love of thanks for gentle deeds, O sympathy with lowly needs, O claims of care, and balms of song, I fear'd ye meant to do me wrong, And let me fade with stifled heart, Ere time and I had leave to part; But waking lately in the morn, Just as a golden day was born, Lo the dull clouds, by sickness wrought, Began to break on heights of thought, And fresh from out the Muse's sky Three visions of a Queen had I; Three in auspicious link benign; One dear, one gorgeous, one divine! The first—(and let no spirit dare That vision with my soul to share, But such as know that angels spread Their wings above a mother's bed)— The first disclos'd her where she lay In pillow'd ease, that blessed day, Which just had made her pale with joy Of the wish'd-for, princely boy, Come to complete, and stamp with man, The line which gentler grace began. See, how they smooth her brows to rest, Faint, meek, yet proud, and wholly blest; And how she may not speak the while But only sigh, and only smile, And press his pressing hand who vies In bliss with her beloved eyes. Vanish'd that still and sacred room; And round me, like a pomp in bloom, Was a proud chapel, heavenly bright With lucid glooms of painted light Hushing the thought with holy story, And flags that hung asleep in glory, And scutcheons of emblazon bold, The flowers of trees of memories old. And living human flowers were there, New colouring the angelic air; Young beauties mix'd with warriors gray, And choristers in lily array, And princes, and the genial king With the wise companioning, And the mild manhood, by whose side Walks daily forth his two years' bride, And she herself, the rose of all, Who wears the world's first coronal,— She, lately in that bower of bliss, How simple and how still to this! Forever and anon there roll'd The gusty organ manifold, Like a golden gate of heaven On its hinges angel-driven To let through a storm and weight Of its throne's consenting's state; Till the dreadful grace withdrew Into breath serene as dew, Comforting the ascending hymn With notes of softest seraphim. Then was call on Jesus mild; And in the midst that new-born child Was laid within the lap of faith, While his prayer the churchman saith, And gifted with two loving names— One the heir of warlike fames, And one befitting sage new line Against the world grow more benign. Like a bubble, children-blown, Then was all that splendour flown; And in a window by the light Of the gentle moon at night, Talking with her love apart And her own o'erflowing heart, That queen and mother did I see Too happy for tranquillity; Too generous-happy to endure The thought of all the woful poor Who that same night laid down their heads In mockeries of starving beds, In cold, in wet, disease, despair, In madness that will say no prayer; With wailing infants, some; and some By whom the little clay lies dumb; And some, whom feeble love's excess, Through terror, tempts to murderousness. And at that thought the big drops rose In pity for her people's woes; And this glad mother and great queen Weeping for the poor was seen, And vowing in her princely will That they should thrive and bless her still. And of these three fair sights of mine, That was the vision most divine. LINES ON THE BIRTH OF THE PRINCESS ALICE. Though the laurel's courtly bough Boast again its poet now, One with verse, too, calm and stately, Fit to sing of greatness greatly, Granted yet be one last rhyme To the muse that sang meantime, If for nought but to make known That she sang for love alone; That she sang from out a heart Used to play no sordid part; That howe'er a hope might rise, Strange to her unprosperous eyes, Ere the cloud came in between All sweet harvests and their queen, Still the faith was not the fee Nor gratitude expectancy. Oh! the soul that never thought Meanly, when a throne it fought, Was it not as far above All that's mean, with one to love? Welcome then, fair new delight, Welcome to thy fathers sight, Welcome to thy sister, brother, And thy sweet strong-hearted mothe, (Faithful to all duties she That could prosper them and thee;) Welcome, playmate of them all, Future grace of bower and hall, Queen perchance of some great land Whose kisses wait thy little hand. Thou art come in right good time, With the sweetest of the prime, With the green trees and the flowers, Orchard blooms and sunny showers, And the cuckoo and the bee, And lark's angelic ecstasy, And the bird that speaks delight Into the close ear of night. What a world, were human kind All of one instructed mind! What a world to rule, to please, To share 'twixt enterprise and ease! Graceful manners flowing round From the court's enchanted ground, Comfort keeping all secure, None too rich, and none too poor. Thee, meantime, fair child of one, Fit to see that golden sun, Thee may no worse lot befall Than a long life, April all; Fuller, much, of hopes than fears, Kind in smiles and kind in tears, Graceful, cheerful, ever new, Heaven and earth both kept in view, While the poor look up and bless Thy celestial bounteousness. And, when all thy days are done, And sadness views thy setting sun, Mayst thou greet thy mother's eyes, And endless May in Paradise. RIGHT AND MIGHT. ON BEING ASKED WHETHER I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT WAS RIGHT. Thus far I do:—that Right of Might Springs but from something per se right,— Some health, strength, knowledge. To beat might, You must fight might with righter right. But suppose might an infant smite, Would you call that a right of might? Yes; of the madman's teeth to bite. 'Tis you, O world, must set that right With the great Might of Love and Light. DREAM WITHIN DREAM; OR, A DREAM IN HEAVEN; OR, EVIL MINIMIZED. What evil would be, could it be, the Blest Are sometimes fain to know. They sink to rest, Dream for a moment's space of care and strife, Wake, stare, and smile, and that was human Life. MORGIANA IN ENGLAND.Air—The Deil cam fiddling through the town. 1815. Oh, one that I know is a knavish lass, Though she looks so sweet and simple, Her eyes there are none can safely pass, And it's wrong to trust her dimple. So taking the jade was by Nature made, So finish'd in all fine thieving, She'll e'en look away what you wanted to say, And smile you out of your grieving. To see her, for instance, go down a dance, You'd think you sat securely, Although she forewarns by no bold advance, And by nothing done over demurely: But Lord! she goes with so blithe a repose, And comes so shapely about you, That ere you're aware, with a glance and an air She whisks your heart from out you. ODE TO THE SUN. The main object of this poem is to impress the beautiful and animating fact, that the greatest visible agent in our universe, the Sun, is also one of the most beneficent; and thus to lead to the inference, that spiritual greatness and goodness are in like proportion, and its Maker beneficence itself, through whatever apparent inconsistencies he may work. The Sun is at once the greatest Might and Right that we behold. A secondary intention of the poem is to admonish the carelessness with which people in general regard the divinest wonders of the creation, in consequence of being used to their society—this great and glorious mystery, the Sun, not excepted. “Familiarity,” it is said, “breeds contempt.” To which somebody emphatically added—“With the contemptible.” I am far from meaning to say that all who behold the Sun with too little thought are contemptible. Habit does strange things, even with the most reflecting. But of this I am sure, that in proportion as anybody wishes to prove himself worthy of his familiarity with great objects, he will not be sorry to be reminded of their greatness, especially as reverence need not diminish delight; for a heavenly “Father” can no more desire the admiration of him to be oppressive to us, than an earthly one; else fatherliness would be unfatherly, and sunshine itself a gloom. When the Florentines crowded to some lectures of Galileo, because they were on a comet which had just made its appearance, the philosopher was bold enough to rebuke them for showing such a childish desire to hear him on this particular subject, when they were in the habit of neglecting the marvels of creation which daily presented themselves to their eyes. Presence divine! Great lord of this our sphere! Bringer of light, and life, and joy, and beauty,— God midst a million gods, that far and near Hold each his orbs in rounds of rapturous duty; Oh never may I, while I lift this brow, Believe in any god less like a god than thou. Thou art the mightiest of all things we see, And thou, the mightiest, art amongst the kindest; The planets, dreadfully and easily, About thee, as in sacred sport, thou windest; And thine illustrious hands, for all that power, Light soft on the babe's cheek, and nurse the budding flower. They say that in thine orb is movement dire, Tempest and flame, as on a million oceans: Well may it be, thou heart of heavenly fire; Such looks and smiles befit a god's emotions; We know thee gentle in the midst of all, By those smooth orbs in heaven, this sweet fruit on the wall. I feel thee here, myself, soft on my hand; Around me is thy mute, celestial presence; Reverence and awe would make me fear to stand Within thy beam, were not all Good its essence: Were not all Good its essence, and from thence All good, glad heart deriv'd, and child-like confidence. I know that there is Fear, and Grief, and Pain, Strange foes, though stranger guardian friends, of Pleasure: I know that poor men lose, and rich men gain, Though oft th' unseen adjusts the seeming measure: I know that Guile may teach, while Truth must bow, Or bear contempt and shame on his benignant brow. But while thou sitt'st, mightier than all, O Sun, And e'en when sharpest felt, still throned in kindness, I see that greatest and that best are one, And that all else works tow'rds it, though in blindness Evil I see, and Fear, and Grief, and Pain, Work under Good their lord, embodied in thy reign. I see the molten gold darkly refine O'er the great sea of human joy and sorrow; I hear the deep voice of a grief divine Calling sweet notes to some diviner morrow; And though I know not how the two may part, I feel thy rays, O Sun, write it upon my heart. Upon my heart thou writest it, as thou, Heart of these worlds, art writ on by a greater: Beam'd on with love from some still mightier brow, Perhaps by that which waits some new relator; Some amaz'd man, who sees new splendours driven Thick round a Sun of suns, and fears he looks at heaven. 'Tis easy for vain man, Time's growing child, To dare pronounce on thy material seeming: Heav'n, for its own good ends, is mute and mild To many a wrong of man's presumptuous dreaming. Matter, or mind, of either what knows he? Or how with more than both thine orb divine may be? Art thou a god indeed? or thyself heaven? And do we taste thee here in light and flowers? Art thou the first sweet place, where hearts, made even, Sing tender songs in earth-remembering bowers? Enough, my soul. Enough through thee, O Sun, To learn the sure good song,—Greatest and Best are one. Enough for man to work, to hope, to love, Copying thy zeal untir'd, thy smile unscorning: Glad to see gods thick as the stars above, Bright with the God of gods' eternal morning; Round about whom perchance endless they go, Ripening their earths to heavens, as love and wisdom grow. A BLESSED SPOT. FROM AN EPIGRAM OF ABOUFADHEL AHMED, SURNAMED AL HAMADAIN, RECORDED IN D'HERBELOT. Hamadan is my native place; And I must say, in praise of it, It merits, for its ugly face, What everybody says of it. Its children equal its old men In vices and avidity, And they reflect the babes again In exquisite stupidity. VERSES ON A FULL FLOWING PERUKE, BY RICHARD HONEYCOMB, ESQ. 1673. Did ever laurel, famed in story, Cover a man with so much glory, Or warrant him to look so big, As that great modern boast, a wig? Some Roman ladies wore a front With hyperbolic friz upon't; And we are told of Goths and Scythians With wigs; but their's were short and pithy ones. None of the ancients, as I see, Laid claim to our crinosity, Or took the breath of the beholders With hairy torrents down the shoulders, Melting a dozen scalps in one, Enough to make a lion run. The monarch, whose inglorious look (Having a natural-born peruke) Gave rise to this great capillation, Ill treateth sure his gallant nation, And takes too many pains by far In seeking such renown in war, Picking for 's head superfluous laurels In shape of Dutch and Spanish quarrels, When he must know, that he who claps Two yards of goat's-hair at his chaps, Succeeds at once to all the rights And privileges o' the greatest knights, Reaping such honours from the dead As never yet invested head, And may dispense with wit and parts In vanquishing the ladies' hearts. To have a little reading, once Might mark a gallant from a dunce; Some grammar did not come amiss, And wit could much exalt a kiss: But now your man is he who saddles His head with the great'st hairy straddles, And all that sep'rates wits from ninnies, Is, “Did your wig cost fifty guineas?” Hail, two-tail'd comet of this age, Portending bills, and amorous rage! Hail, brains of beaux turn'd inside out Tossing your scented froth about, And turning brisk on the beholders With copied airs across the shoulders! Through thee we come at beauty's blushes, Like Jove through clouds, or Pan through bushes To thee I owe (besides, I fear, Some hundreds to my perruquier;) To thee I owe my Chloe's passion, Her fears, and fond incarceration; And more than all, I owe to thee That Jack Hall's wig has set me free. DOGGREL ON DOUBLE COLUMNS AND LARGE TYPE. Be present, ye home Truths and Graces, That throw a charm on commonplaces, And make a street or an old door Look as it never look'd before, Nay, doggrel's very self refine Into a bark not quite canine (Rather, a voice that once those fairies Took delight in, call'd the Lares; Fire-side gods, that used to sit Loving jolly dogs and wit;) For with a truth on our own part, Which, though it frisketh, is at heart The solemnest of all the solemns, We sing, imprimis, Double Columns; And secondly, our noble Type, Beauteous as Raphael, clear as Cuyp. Double Columns, in all places, Are always cause of double graces; They grace one's front, and grace one's wings, And do all sorts of graceful things, Making a welcome fit for queens; But most of all in magazines. Look at the fact. All monthly publi- Cations that have been column'd doubly, Have always hit the public fancy Better, and with more poignàncy Than your platter-fac'd, broad pages; Witness things that liv'd for ages,— London Magazines, and Towns And Countrys, of charade renowns; The old Monthly, still surviving Though with single life now striving; And the old Gentleman's (why also Should he change, and risk a fall so?) Truly old gentleman was he, And liv'd to hail the century, Although his diet was no better Than an old tombstone or dead letter. Then look at Blackwood, look at Fraser; To them and their sales what d'ye say, Sir? Tories, I own; the more's the pity; But double-column'd, and therefore witty: For columns (quoth th' Horatian fiddling) Don't permit people to be middling. The Dublin University Might also spell his name with g,— With o and g, and call himself The Doubling,—therefore fit for shelf; A clever dog; though he, too, beats His Dublin drum with Toryous heats. Tait, lastly, hath his columns double, Though he began (which gave him trouble) With single ones. I warn'd him of it, And now, you see, he owns me prophet. Lucky for Tait;—because I prophesied Also, that wealth would thus be of-his-side. I only wish his columns were of Narrower edifice; since thereof Greater snugness comes, and easiness Of reading, which is half the business. Oh, nothing like your double columns! Notions of single ones are all hums. Compare a single one with any Two that you see, how like a zany It looks; how poor, inept, inhuman! Oh, ever while you live, have two, man; Two, like two legs; and don't be branding With love of one your understanding. Fancy a door with one provided! How ludicrous! one-legged! lop-sided; Whereas with two, like tit for tat, Pediment, cornice, and all that, It stands like something worth looking at, Or a stout fellow in a cock'd hat. See our own door-way, at page one; There's fitness for a Parthenon! Two columns, bearing that first story Of strong and sweet Repository. Will any man who hates a flat style, Or a forc'd, object to that style? Will Mr. Gwilt, or Mr. Barry, Or Mr. What's-his-name? No, marry. Our front demands them to be stout; So no pun, pray, on the word gout. Turn but the corner, and look there; There see our columns mount in air, So smooth, and sweet, and with a smile, Air seems itself to feel the style. No one will say, with wondering brows, As the man did to Carlton House, “Care colonne, che fate quà?” Nor will the columns, with hum and ha, Say “Non sappiamo, in verità.” A pretty jest, 'faith, and a queer, To ask our columns how they came here! Egad, they'd say to such suggestion, “How came you here, that ask the question?” Double then be your columns, ever: Were single ones in Nature? Never. (There's nothing like a round assertion) And history holds them in aversion. All her best columns go by twos;— Witness those pillars of the Jews, Jachin and Boaz, which implied That Love and Pow'r go side by side; And those which Hercules set up, When he sat down in Spain to sup On fame and gratitude (no dull tray) And carv'd upon them Ne plus ultra; Meaning, “You can't surpass my columns;” Words in our favour that speak volumes. Upon the like, deny who can, Goes that most wondrous fabric, man, And on two legs walks noble and steady; But this we have touch'd upon already. Thus emperors walk; yea, poets; yea, My lady B. and lady A.; Yea (not to speak it lightly) queens; And so must wits in magazines. In short, look at the common sense O' the case, and frame your judgment thence. So wide are single-column'd pages, The eyes grow tir'd with the long stages; At each line's end you feel perplex'd For the beginning of the next, And have to run back all the way To find it, and keep saying “Eh?” Now double ones require but glances; From line to line the sweet eye dances, Without a strain, or the least trouble, And thus th' enjoyment's truly double, Taking your meaning and your thinking, As easily as lovers, winking. Besides, meanwhile it has an eye to The other column it runs nigh to; Which doubly doubles the enjoyment, By certainty of more employment; Just like that terrible Greek, who reckon'd, While courting one love, on a second; Or as your gourmand, dining pleasantly, Says, “I'll attack that pigeon presently.” So much for columns. Now for type. What soul, of any judgment ripe, Or wise by dint of good intentions, But must exult in its dimensions? What good heart swell not at a size So very good for good old eyes? Nay, good for eyes too not grown old, But tried by labours manifold, And glad not to be forc'd to take To spectacles and vision-ache? Young eyes, of course, can find no fault with it; And babes that learn to spell, won't halt with it: So that, in fact, the only pages To suit all eyes and suit all ages, And fill the whole earth's visual powers With tears of transport, will be ours! Good heav'ns! what an amazing glory! Unknown in periodic story! We knew once a shrewd speculator, Young withal, and fond of pater, Who in the course of a right breeding Had got such filial views of reading, That he projected an old men's Newspaper, to be call'd—The Lens; That is to say, a glass to read it; Because the print was not to need it! (We think we see old Munden kneading The word, in his intensest reading, And counting it a gain, exceeding). Well, here's a Lens in all its glory, The type of the Repository;— A glass, without a glass's need;— A print, that cries to all “Come, read!” How pleasant to reverse, for once, The cares that patronise good sons, And give good sons occasion rather To filiatronize their father. There's a strange tale of an old sire, Who screaming every moment higher, Came running from a house, or rather Hobbling, and follow'd by his father, Who was belabouring him, because Forgetful of all filial laws, “Th' ungracious boy,” like a drawcansir, Had laid a stick upon his grandsire!! Observe our sweet Repository, How 'twill reverse this horrid story. For sure as we see future ages Rise, like May-mornings, o'er our pages, We see full many a grateful sire, Old as that grandson, but all fire, Come smiling from his home, and telling The neighbours round about the dwelling, How he had left, with eyes all glistening, His father to his grandsire listening, Who taking up our magazine, And putting his white locks serene Pleasantly back, and looking proud, Read it, upon the spot, out loud What need to add another syllable? Hearts, that could stand this, are unkillable. THE ROYAL LINE. [1836?] William I. The sturdy Conq'ror, politic, severe; William II. Light-minded Rufus, dying like the deer; Henry I.
