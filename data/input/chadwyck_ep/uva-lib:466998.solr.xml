      <field name="fulltext">TO W. M. ROSSETTI THESE RECORDS OF A SEASON ARE INSCRIBED IN MEMORY OF THE FRIENDSHIP OF HALF A LIFETIME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. PROLOGUE. LITTLE dear! we often say To bright young eyes and dainty ears: The two words oft together go, Would I could know Together they might go to-day, And designate in coming years, These my verses—rather small, I hope, to weary or appal— Small as drops of blood or tears. ‘Pretty if good!’ grand-dame replied To the vain youngster by her side: ‘Good if true,’ it seems to me, Our verses should be judged to be: If nature prompts, not merely art: Only emotion's potent spell Can clothe life with the lovely shell, And send the rhyme like love's own dart Flying direct from heart to heart. Ah me! then, reader, can you say ‘Little dears’ to these to-day? THE POET'S OPPORTUNITY. Smoothed by this untiring tide, The rocks that crop up on this strand Make pleasant seats, we there abide, And spread our white cloth on the sand. 'Twas such a gentle sea, none there Could ever after quite forget, Sea-mews sloped near us through warm air, The small white cloudlets made a fret, High, higher still, like Jacob's stair. What do they now in ancient Rome,— Where we were looked for certainly, We chose this year to stay at home, And lay the stale schoolmaster bye. ‘Art is something more than nature,’ Something from the artist's life, Life orders and selects, makes sure, Frees the melody from strife. But that life lapses 'neath the sway Of motives long since past and gone; Beautiful once, they had their day, We look for bread and find a stone. Let the pulse beat: a verse or two May come from this kind solitude, By sea, in bower, 'neath cloud, or blue, To fit our manhood's present mood. THE FOXGLOVE: A REMINISCENCE OF THE WAR 1870. I. That foxglove by the garden gate, The very day the war began, Opened its first, its lowest flower. The post that morn was late; Anxious I waited for the man, Then went into this wild-rose bower, And heard the warning voice of fate. Week by week, even day by day, Another petal opened fair, Advancing up the long light stem: I counted them, As I passed there, While my heart was far away, Listening early, listening late, To the German march—the march of Fate: And when France lay Quivering in the gory clay, The topmost bell Rang a dirge before it fell. II. Oft throughout that deadly fight, We owned that might was right. For from the step of the Madeleine, Amid the trumpets' loud fanfare, Years long ago we had seen there Louis, triumphant from the South, Hailed by the brutal popular mouth; Through the streets where late the stain Of blood lay did his triumph fare. I heard the cheer; While many said the day must come, When, God with us, right shall be might. Behold! with cannon, trump, and drum Now was it here! The span of time A foxglove bloom its stalk might climb, He passed for ever from our sight. THE GARDEN BOWER. But what have wars or kings to do With our quiet country ways, Or with poetry now-a-days? The Foxglove by the gate that grew Brought them to mind, and made me lose Myself in that past stream of news: And there it still remains to-day; The Mistress of our Garden Bower Caring for each wild blossoming The summer months successive bring. Each morning here, in sun or shower, Awhile we sit while I rehearse, As matin service, some new lay, Some little verse, Various as this sea-side weather, Or that hill-side rough with heather, Rhyme-children of the transient hour, Records perchance of yesterday, Or tales from twilights far away. THE ROBIN. Crumbs for the robin; well he knew The click of that old garden gate, Among the leaves he somewhere flew, Nor came to breakfast ever late. From twig to twig he ventures near, With sidelong bright dark eye he comes, Not for the poems but the crumbs: We take good care he need not fear. Is that the garden gate again? Comes the maid to gather peas? It is the gardener, well-known swain: Our robin likes old friends like these. But hark! that click once more, we see A caller feathered for the day, He knows as well, it seems, as we The time is come to fly away. CONTENT. Yestreen I heard a child's faint cry, ‘Where is Phemie, Phemie Blayne?’ As I with book in hand passed by— Call louder, child, oh, call again. The infant did, it shrieked amain, ‘Annie Logie, where is she?’ A sweeter name than Phemie Blayne! Where can the loitering damsels be? Annie Logie, Phemie Blayne! Good heavens, could I only see Their innocent faces, they might sain And save poor thought-distempered me. In that thatched cottage to remain, Phemie Blayne to woo and wed, Or Annie Logie choose instead! Were I but twenty-one again, With no ambitions in my head! PHEMIE BLAYNE. ‘Mistress, here is Phemie Blayne Selling mushrooms once again; Annie Logie came before You had passed your chamber door, So I filled the basket there—’ Mushrooms! Phemie Blayne! oh where? With that I ran pell-mell down stair. This was but trifling to restore The interest of the day before,— But there she stood, Clothed in her beauty, plainly good. Upon her auburn hair a hood, Coarse perhaps, but white as milk, Neater than the finest silk: Tall and elastic, strong and free, Like a blossoming apple-tree, Earnest-eyed and womanly, Yet little more than child to-day, There stood she waiting patiently. Phemie Blayne! I still can see Thy queenhood, humbling then to me, And wonder if thy destiny Is good as God has been to thee. THE SCHOOL-CHILDREN. Except very minor thanges, necessary to accommodate the Rhymes sung by the children to the rest of the poem, they are here exactly given as sung by little girls in play in Ayrshire. The children in their best at last Were gathered on the lawn, By sex divided, or by ages classed; Had nuts or oranges, then lists were drawn For leaping, running, and the rest; Some did right well, but Willie best. At first the taller girls were shy Against the boys their powers to try, But whispering long, together cling, Till their little scheme is planned, When down they sit in one wide ring, While one by lot selected stood, In her hand her neat white hood. Then out and in, the circle round Stepping, she began to sing: ‘I writ a letter to my love, ‘And on the way I dropt it, ‘I carried it within my glove, ‘But still and still I dropt it, ‘I dropt, I dropt—’ Then suddenly she stopt, Amidst the bright clear faces crowned With expectation shining round, And all the little ready feet. Ready to jump up to meet The hood when it was thrown! The game was then to run so fast, To o'ertake her the hood had cast, But who already far had flown, In and about, and round and round All the bright faces on the ground. Another of these innocent games Perplexed us, although much we tried To understand the joyous claims Its rhymes denied. ‘Rise, sister Sally, now, rise if you can, ‘Rise, sister Sally, and choose a young man; ‘Choose to the east and choose to the west, ‘And choose out the very one you can love best.’ After this song we scarce could tell How many changes there befell, With dancing left and dancing right, And singing thus with all their might: ‘Now you are married, ay, married in joy, ‘First for a girl and next for a boy; ‘Seven years long enough, seven years, oh ho, ‘Now the play's played out, kiss, kiss, and go, go.’ With milk and cake, as well as game, They had enough when evening came, And sunset gilt each dainty head, Showing time to go to bed. So with another wild huzzay, Their banners waved them all away. GLENKINDIE. About Glenkindie and his man, A false ballant hath long been writ; Some bootless loon had written it, Upon a bootless plan: But I have found the true at last, And here it is, so hold it fast. 'Twas made by a kind damozel Who loved him and his man right well. Glenkindie, best of harpers, came Unbidden to our town, And he was sad and sad to see, For love had worn him down. It was the love, as all men know, The love that brought him down The hopeless love for the king's daughter The dove that heired a crown. Now he wore not that collar of gold, His dress was forest green, His wondrous fair and rich mantel Had lost its silvery sheen. But still by his side walked Rafe, his boy, In goodly cramoisie, Of all the boys that ever I saw, The goodliest boy was he. Oh, Rafe the page, oh Rafe the page, Ye stole the heart frae me; Oh, Rafe the page, oh Rafe the page, I wonder where ye be; We ne'er may see Glenkindie more, But may we never see thee? Glenkindie came within the hall, We set him on the dais, And gave him bread, and gave him wine, The best in all the place. We set for him the guest's high chair, And spread the naperie, Our Dame herself would serve for him, And I for Rafe, perdie! But down he sat on a low, low stool, And thrust his long legs out, And leant his back to the high chair, And turned his harp about. He turned it round, he stroked the strings, He touched each tirling-pin, He put his mouth to the sounding-board And breathed his breath therein. And Rafe sat over against his face, And looked at him wistfullie, I almost grat ere he began, They were so sad to see. The very first stroke he strack that day We all came crowding near, And the second stroke he strack that day We all were smit with fear. The third stroke that he strack that day Full fain we were to cry, The fourth stroke that he strack that day We thought that we would die. No tongue can tell how sweet it was, How far and yet how near, We saw the saints in Paradise, And bairnies on their bier. And our sweet Dame saw her good lord She told me privilie— She saw him as she saw him last, On his ship upon the sea. Anon he laid his little harp by, He shut his wondrous eyes, We stood a long time like dumb things, Stood in a dumb surprise. Then all at once we left that trance, And shouted where we stood, We clasped each other's hands and vowed We would be wise and good. Soon he rose up and Rafe rose too, He drank wine and broke bread, He clasped hands with our trembling Dame, But never a word he said. They went, alack and lack-a-day, They went the way they came. I followed them all down the floor, And oh but I had drouth, To touch his cheek, to touch his hand, To kiss Rafe's velvet mouth. But I knew such was not for me: They went straight from the door; We saw them fade within the mist, And never saw them more. TELIESSIN. Once on a time, as stories tell, Teliessin, Cymric master-bard, Leant o'er the fire in the bardic hall, Thinking of the ills that fall On a small people nigh a great; Ills waxen measureless of late, Since his master's passing bell Passed the mountain road so hard; The road to an untimely grave, Untimely to the good and brave. The dying embers flickered down, In from the night dry leaves had blown, When a faint sound his ear doth greet, That makes him rise upon his feet. Was it the disused wires that rung, Of some old harp by night-wind swung, Within this bardic cloister hung? It was not wind, no blasts now blow, But gently first, and sweetly slow, His master's harp from that high wall, Preluded, rose to battle call, Then changed by moaning fainting fall Into the dirge wherewith the bard Passed that mountain road so hard. Teliessin turned, but nought could see, Cried out,—‘Come, Master, come to me!’ A strange, far-off dear voice replied, ‘Come thou, come over to this side: There are harpers brave and good In the heart of God's great wood: Son Teliessin, come away.’ ‘Master dear,’ the young man cried, ‘I am ready, show the way!’ This was the day Ten years ago the master died; This was the darkening hour also, Teliessin left both friend and foe. Nor ever from that night agen Hath he been seen by mortal men. HELP. When the portly monk would ride, Upon his patron-saint he cried For help, if the good saint inclined, This once to be so kind. Then with a long and strong essay, He rose in such a vigorous way, As sent him over t' other side. He rubbed his shin, set straight his hood, And to his saint again he cried, Worse and worse! you're over good, I always like to stop half way! OISIN. This legendary account of the end of the Irish Ossian, is derived from the ancient story of considerable length given in Dr. Joyce's very interesting ‘Old Celtic Romances.’ Oisin, son of great Fingal, Of Fenian race the last of all, Longed to see his native land With longing nothing could withstand. An hundred years ago and more, He had left old Erin's shore, On the winged white horse astride, Left in the mists that all things hide, With the strange princess in his arms, Left for the realm beyond all harms, Beyond the moon, beyond the sea, Unknown to bards of best degree, Where the sword was never tried, Where they were neither born nor died; The realm of Youth, youth ever more. With years the longing grew apace, The nameless princess by his side, Loving and lovely, limb and face, Tall and bright as is the flame, That lights the witches' deeds of shame, Beautiful and filled with pride, Such as no bard can express Who knows not the wild leopardess; But he left and hither came. ‘Dismount not from thy winged white horse, See old Erin and come back, Dismount not or it will be worse Than I can tell thee, worse, alack!’ She signed him on his eye and ear With water from the Wells of Fear, And the wingéd courser bore Oisin to old Erin's shore. Erin, land of my desire, Land of my childhood and my sire! He cried as on the horse he sat, Agadsa, ataim agat! ‘With thee, I am with thee,’ in the ancient Irish. His eyes at first so filled with tears, Scarce saw he, but soon wept aloud, It went beyond his fears; There was no Tara left at all, There was no bard, no harp, no hall, But tonsured pigmies in a crowd, Were building bell-towers everywhere. Erin, land beyond all peers, Erin, land of my desire, Woe's me, thou hast not passed the fire As I have done, the fire of years: Oisin's tears were salt indeed Sitting upon the winged white steed. Alas, the pigmies by his side, Struggling to raise a lintel-stone, Began to tremble, and to moan, Down he leapt with kindly speed, At once, his strength was gone, his hair Was snow-white, he bent trembling there, He touched old Erin's ground and died. THE SEA. These froward waves, we feign they try To utter to us some mystery: Such is the euphuistic game We baffled poets follow. Pantheistic? All the same, Like the sounding cymbal hollow:— We it is and not the sea Long to speak out God's mystery: Immense and world-old salt ocean, With thy moon-adoring motion, Thou hast nought to us to say, We must speak and thou obey. THE TIDE. Obliviously we long sat there Weaving lines to praise the sea, Objecting still, we still compare, And try to make the rhythm agree Between the verses and the sea. When we thus began, the wave Drove the pebbles up the beach, Then resilient to the main Drew them with it back again: Nor dreamt we where the tide might reach, Till it was round us everywhere, Deep enough to be our grave! For this is still the destined way, We are the masters, yet the prey. AT SEA. Now the tide is safe and high, In the fresh'ning morning breeze, Over the harbour bar we hie Out into the open seas. With these fisher lads so strong And knowing in the water ways, I'll try to make a summer song, The fisher's summer life to praise. It seems to me the rounded sea Begins to swell above the shore, And the great gull, that fisher free, Dives right down a yard or more. With main and jib we bound along, Through showers of spray we rise and dip, But as for making any song, That needs a sea apprenticeship. And now we meet the ocean swell, The bow swings high up in the air; My breath goes with it! I know well The land is best for me, not there! We islanders should love the sea, The fresh wind, coiled nets, ballast heap, And full brown sail; but as for me, Again within that harbour's lee, I let the sea-song go to sleep! THE HURRICANE. This morn the wind flew through the trees Like a flock of driven game, And as the morning passed to noon It waxed into a raving flame. These fisher lads that yesterday Rowed us to the fresh green sea, Said they were bound to start betimes, For whitings round by Ailsa's lee. Heaven help them in this furious gale; I'll make my way down to the strand, And see if both friends, Rob and Will, Have got safe back to wife and land. It was no easy thing to do, To struggle with the gale to-day, To struggle and conquer, one strong man, Buttoned up on firm foot-way. But down upon the quay the surf Flew, blinding eyes and over head, And there amidst the coil I found Little Effie wild with dread. She could not hear, I could not speak, The roaring of the winds forbade, So there I made her cling to me, And this is what may now be said. Her hood was gone, her loosened hair Shot round us like a tangled net, But still she stared across the bar Through blinding locks and blind seafret. For there she knew the boat, my God! Where Robin rowed and Willie steered, Between the grey wall and the bay, With spray and mist obscurely bleared. Ah! will they do it, can it live,— Their coble in that hurricane, Rocks below and walls to face? Effie wiped her eyes in pain, But still I thought she could not see, She wiped them, wiped them yet again. Is it over, has it mounted in? Yes, yes, oh, little Effie, now Let me wipe your eyes once more, Willie knows you from the prow. THE NORNS WATERING YGGDRASILL. (FOR A PICTURE.) Within the unchanging twilight Of the high land of the gods, Between the murmuring fountain And the Ash-tree, tree of trees, The Norns, the terrible maidens, For evermore come and go. Yggdrasill the populous Ash-tree, Whose leaves embroider heaven, Fills all the grey air with music— To Gods and to men sweet sounds, But speech to the fine-eared maidens Who evermore come and go. That way to their doomstead thrones The Aesir ride each day, And every one bends to the saddle As they pass beneath the shade; Even Odin, the strong All-father, Bends to the beautiful maidens Who cease not to come and go. The tempest crosses the high boughs, The great snakes heave below, The wolf, the boar, and antlered harts Delve at the life-giving roots, But all of them fear the wise maidens, The wise-hearted water-bearers Who evermore come and go. And men far away, in the night-hours To the north-wind listening, hear, They hear the howl of the were-wolf, And know he hath felt the sting Of the eyes of the potent maidens Who sleeplessly come and go. They hear on the wings of the north wind A sound as of three that sing, And the skald, in the blae mist wandering High on the midland fell, Heard the very words of the o'ersong Of the Norns who come and go. But alas for the ears of mortals Chance-hearing that fate-laden song! The bones of the skald lie there still,— For the speech of the leaves of the Tree Is the song of the three Queen-maidens Who evermore come and go. THOROLF AND GUDRUN. Would you be free of a salt-sea grave, Drink from your palm of the high tenth wave, Eat of the yew the topmost leaf, And the midmost cornhead out of the sheaf, Bind a rune around each arm; Then you need fear no salt-sea harm. Thorolf, stark and large of bone, Must whet his sword, his casque must don, And leave long-haired Gudrun alone: Thorolf did all these and more, He threw the live brand from the door, They clasped hands through the thorough stone, Three kisses kissed, and he was gone. Gudrun ascends to her own bower, The highest chamber in the tower: She opens the small shot-window That she may see the great ships go, Far away and far below: Now they come, the wide wings set That all the southern gale be met; The first was large, the sails were red, With the black raven on them spread, In that the first, so proud, so fair, My love and all his men must fare; Another, more grand still, comes on, My lover's sure must be that one— But a larger dragon still Quits the shadow of the hill; Oh, I must learn each name to call, And make charmed runes for each and all. Round by Lessoe's broken strand, Out by Elsinore's white sand, They ride the dark-green ocean free, Straight westward to the English sea, With heavy brand and grasping hand They swoop down on nord-Humber land. And now the green cloth, red cloth rare, He wins Gudrun to shape and wear, A golden tire for her light hair When the bower-maidens braid it tight, After the marriage day and night; Many a gift to hang in hall, And great carved chest to hold them all. On they pass from shore to shore, But runners fleet have fled before; Mascled breast, mailed hand and knee, Gather within the high mole's lee. Ah, wide-winged Hugin now flies past To Valhall's high wall bound so fast: Were I a true skald, I could see The fate-dealing Damsels, three by three, Fold up their sleeves, beneath each heart Tighten their girdles, and depart. Gudrun, Gudrun, look out again, Look over that far stormy main, Dost thou see them three by three, Flying towards the Scottish sea? Second sight is not for thee, But dost thou see These ships returning to our bay, And every man who went away, Proud with the spoils of his sword-play, Leaping from their prows this day? Nay, far away, With rolled-up sleeves these Doomsters grey, Fly over heads of struggling men. Men struggling in the deadly fray, And again and yet again, Like hungry eagles, birds of prey, They stoop And mark the heads that death shall coop. Gudrun, to-day The arrows fly and some must die, The spears' thrust levelled to the heart, No sword can waive their deadly smart. Will Thorolf safe that deck regain, Or is he coiled among the slain? Gudrun, Gudrun, look out again— But now the thick white smoke is blown From those high ships where men are mown: The mist comes over heart and brain. Bleach, oh bleach, my white linen, Bleach, oh bleach, my grey, I too am bleaching white and thin, It is a year, a year to-day,— Why doth Thorolf stay away? Why doth Thorolf stay? That and this were for my bed, Yon was on the board to lay, This to make my bower glad, And that was for embroidery. Bleach, oh bleach, my white linen, Bleach, oh bleach, my grey, I too am bleaching white and thin, Why doth Thorolf stay? Summer went and autumn rose, Autumn passed with moaning gale, Long winter followed with its close Of wandering tempest, icy hail. Bleach, oh bleach, my white linen, Bleach, oh bleach, my grey, I too am bleaching white and thin, Why doth my Thorolf stay? Now spring, long waited for, at last Alone thou comest back to me, My empty arms abroad I cast As I sit on this bleaching lea: My eyes are failing, I scarce see The linen lying on the lea. But what's my linen now to me? Few yards can wind a wasted May, It is a year, a year to-day, Why doth Thorolf stay away? Why doth Thorolf stay? THE NYMPH OF ARCADIE. ‘Young Loves to sell!’ a voice calls out Beneath the trees, ‘Young loves to sell!’ From porch and garden round about, Child, maid, and matron hasten out— The voice was like a silver bell, ‘Young loves to sell!’ She took the basket from her head, This cunning nymph of Arcadie— ‘Look at the soft wings, grey and red, Fluttering in their pleachen bed, Who'll buy? I will not wait, you see, Who'll come to me?’ ‘Young loves to sell!’ The children run About her, ‘O take all our toys, Take all we have and give us one!’ Old Laia spinning in the sun Cries, ‘Long since lost I all my joys, Give me but one!’ ‘Young loves to sell! I will not stay, So maidens, maidens, come and buy, I cannot give them without pay, Nor let them fly; I'll go away, If no one quickly comes to try If she can buy. ‘See how each little rosy dear Smiles through the wicker bars at you, Do not let your faint hearts fear My darling loves, they smile and peer, And this one, with wings azure blue, He beckons you.’ Silvia, where is Silvia hid?— She loosed the pearling from her hair, Her golden necklace she undid, Her bracelet from her wrist she slid, And ran and caught the prize so rare, Silvia the fair. Then every one, and all at once, Struggling round the wise nymph flew, None would rest without a chance, Such shining eyes and such a dance! But Silvia's prettiest was I knew, Wings azure blue! CUPID AMONG THE MAIDENS. That long-winged boy is sure to prate, So forward and so sly, He grows too great, 'tis quite too late To have him peep and pry. He never leaves our sight, he's here And there and everywhere, A listening ear for ever near We will no longer bear. We must fall on him might and main, Bridget and I and you, But don't be cruel, naughty Jane, Don't kiss him, silly Prue! We'll set him in the stocks and go, We'll lock him fast all day, But we may let him keep his bow— The child must have his play. Thus did they, and with laughter great, Their game was well begun, Alas; ere they had shut the gate, He pinked them every one. MUSIC. Listless the silent ladies sit About the room so gaily lit; Madame Ions likes the cups or tray, But thinks it scarce enough to say: Mistress Cox is gone astray To the night-light in her own nursery, Wonders if little Maude was led Without long coaxing into bed: Miss Jemima Applewhite, On a low stool by the fire, Concentrates her confused desire,— Perhaps will do so all the night, On an unused rhyme for ‘scan,’ And can but find the stiff word man: Miss Temple pets the little hound, That has a tendency to whine, To-night its cushion can't be found; And wonders when they'll leave the wine Few take, but which men still combine To linger over when they dine. Indeed a frightful interval! Madame Ions wants her game, Or she must have her usual wink; But now satiric Bertha Stahl Jumps upon the music-stool, And breaks into a sportive flame; But what of all things do you think She plays, that laughter-loving fool? The funeral march, Dead March of Saul! Oh, Lord of Hosts! their mailéd tread, Bearing along the mailéd dead, Makes me bow my stubborn head. Never underneath the sun Will this heart-fathoming march be done; Still, Lord of Hosts! to thee we cry, When our great ones, loved ones, die, Still some grand lament we crave, When we descend into the grave. I turn, afraid that I may weep,— Jemima's pestered wits still ran After the unused rhyme for ‘scan,’ Dear old Ions was asleep. THE OLD OLD STORY. I. It seems but yesterday, and yet I was then but two years from school, This picture I can not forget, Over all life's seething pool. The sweet light voice, a living lute, The sweet slim figure struck me mute; Matilda was the lovely name, Within a neat red-pencilled frame I wrote it in my first verse book, Snugly kept in secret nook! She came to us beneath the wing Of her mamma, whose bonnet wide Was an epitome of spring,— So long since, I must even confide, The great scooped bonnet was just then Adored by fashion and by men: Well I remember wondering How this frank angel ever came From such a broad-winged pompous dame! And after forty years depart, Child and mamma drop on us here; Can the slim figure and light heart Beneath the same broad wing appear Again in this far distant year? Ah no! the ladies seem the same, But the bonnet is quite different; Matilda is the pompous dame, And this her daughter Millicent! Good heavens! it is indeed just so, Time reproduces all his toys; Here is the pair of long ago Touching the hearts of other boys. And am I then to moralise, With satire in my rhymes and eyes? The sonsy matron! suppose we Ask her now what she thinks of me? II. I would indeed like well to see What Matilda thinks, or thought of me In that romantic early year When her fine name I held so dear, Or at least made it so appear In my long-hid first verses book: I'll try to wile her out to look At the sundial or the bees, And underneath the quivering trees I shall touch on ancient things, That so long since lost all their wings, Or rather, to tell truth, I'd say, Used them long since to fly away. I did at once, and I must own A faintly sentimental tone Stole o'er my reminiscences, As we passed, repassed the bees: I said her child recalled her so,— Revived in me the long ago— The age was just about the same When we once played a charming game, Now quite gone out, upon the grass; And here again the bees we pass; Though she forgets to turn her head, She answers in a cheerful mood, Her daughter is both fair and good. The gravel crunched beneath her tread While she went on, and thus she said: ‘Your memory's good for long ago, I often wish that mine were so, But when a girl is wed like me, And carried quite away to town, The rest soon fades away, you see: The birds gone, soon the nest blows down: Your brother James, now gone, and I Had some flirtations certainly, He was the red-haired one and tall:— I can't remember you at all!’ I made reply, some sidelong mutter; We turned, we joined the rest at tea, She ate three folds of bread and butter, She had never thought at all of me! THE APPLE TREE. Let us lie upon the grass Beneath this apple-tree, To mark the shining white clouds pass, Sailing in the high blue sea, Through the net-work overhead Of boughs and stems so thickly spread, Flickering in the sunlit sheen, Of yellow and green, With apples clustered everywhere. And now a bird Darts into its nest up there; We are neither seen nor heard, But each callow little bill Full well it knows, And each must fill, So off and away again it goes, While we lie upon the grass, Idle as we can be, Watching only what may pass Within this apple tree. THE APPLE. What sound was there? An apple fallen, I declare, Ripe and red, and we will share, As we have shared so much beside: No! let it stay, It makes me think of mistress Eve, And something might betide; What if we too should have to grieve The loss of this our paradise!— But I've heard say, From good Saint Jerome's comment wise, Eve was away When God did that commandment leave, And therefore innocent was Eve: Besides, no Snake is here to-day. APPLE GATHERING. This morn brought tedious news express, To master which in quietness, As soon as might be I had clomb To the room I sometimes call my home. I may confess that pawns or kings On the chessboard of church or court, Bring me nor interest nor sport; Another kind of value clings About the daily sheet for me, An interest of a vulgar sort. But then that child we call the gnome Knocked with both small fists and cried, ‘Theta is in the apple-tree, We are gathering, come and see!’ I felt that I could not be spared, And forthwith to the orchard fared, And soon descried Theta's skirts of dusky red Amidst the boughs, against the sky: Janet too, both mounted there This annual festival to share. The boughs with dark-brown leaves o'erspread, And crimsoned fruit; the sky pure white, With dense blue clefts that look so high, Everything so sharp and bright, Made up a picture chased outright My tiresome news; besides, in joy, The happy household voices too, That touch the heart, a welcome threw About me, and the rich dull sound Of apples dropping on the ground Brought out the laughter of the boy. Great piled-up baskets stood about: ‘How shall we ever eat all these?’ They seemed to him quite infinite— ‘I too would pluck some if I might!’ He clapped his hands, ‘Oh let me, please!’ So I raised him over shoulder high, The reddest, ripest, bunches nigh. He caught them with a childish shout. He was much merrier than was I When I returned to read and write. A BIRTHDAY. (THE HUSBAND SPEAKS. The rhyme shrieked out rather than sung by Scotch children at All Hallow tide, as the author has heard it, is this:— Heigh, how! for Halloween, A' the fairies can be seen, Some blue and some green, Or freckled like a Turkey bean! Mr. R. Chambers, however, gives it— Some black and some green, adding that the black ones are the evil fairies, but the green are the ‘Good People.’ But are there any evil fairies, or are they only evil when badly treated? Is this indeed All-Hallow's day, When fairies hold their annual play? As out of school like bees they fly, I hear the village children cry Upon the faery folk, brown, red, Pink, green and blue, to go to bed. All the faeries that were seen At dawn upon the parson's green. Then, dear, this is your natal day, They may be more than usual gay In their traditional array. But sad to say, I have no gift to bring to you, I had forgot this best of days Until I heard the children's lays! But then 'tis true, Being yours, it is my birth-day too, My second birth—this best of days. BEFORE MARRIAGE. (THE WIFE SPEAKS.) Can you recall the life we led Before our meeting-day, The day that we were wed As I may say? I often do, And wish I knew If it is the same with you. I was not sad, I was not gay, It was my lifetime clad in grey: A continuous December, As I remember, Looking out for Christmas-day, Like a child for cakes and play, With my brother, And my mother, And my sisters in a row: We were sheltered from the snow, I was happy in a way, Before that blessed waking day, But now my life's bound up with thine, You're my perennial cakes and wine. TO THE DEAD. (A PARAPHRASE.) Gone art thou? gone, and is the light of day Still shining, is my hair not touched with grey? But evening draweth nigh, I pass the door, And see thee walking on the dim-lit shore. Gone, art thou? gone, and weary on the brink Of Lethe waiting there. O do not drink, Drink not, forget not, wait a little while, I shall be with thee; we again may smile. ELIJAH. This was written after seeing Sir F. Leighton's noble picture in the Academy Exhibition. The widow heard Elijah's tread, She heard his staff against the door, She wrapped the sackcloth round her head, She took the small corpse from the bed And sternly stood his face before. Silent, as sleep-walking man, He lifted from her breast the child, And shut in his own cell began, With tears that down his long beard ran, The mystery,—God reconciled. Mouth to mouth he gave the breath, Eyes to eyes he gave the sight, Limb to limb,—the child beneath Quivered and began to breathe— Trembled, cried out as in fright. The mother hears outside the door, Her one child is no longer dead, She throws the sackcloth from her head, She stumbles fainting on the floor,— Lift the infant from the bed, Let him his mother's life restore! LOVE AND DEATH. the reader will readily see, has been suggested by G. F. Watts's painting of the same name. ‘Open the door! Thou canst not understand My mission, thou spoilt child of many a god, Thou who dost claim the heart for thy abode; Open the door, lest I put forth my hand And touch thee too, or give such dire command To thy vile brother, Hatred,—now I hear The quills of thy unquiet wings with fear Quiver against thy flanks: no more withstand.’ ‘Oh Death, why comest thou so soon so far? Why comest thou before the appointed hour? I shall not make way for a fate so dire.’ ‘Poor child, I pass despite thy bolt and bar, The torch lit here to grace the bridal bower I make it mine to light the funeral pyre.’ THE OFFERING. AFTER THE ANTIQUE. Hera, Athene, Cypria, great three, Take these for all your care of me:— A golden garland fair, My longest braid of hair, My bridal zone so rare. Small gifts are these to represent The ten years' guerdons ye have sent,— A husband loved and sure, A peaceful life and pure, Male children on the floor. THE EMPEROR JULIAN ON GERMAN DRINK. A PARAPHRASE. By Bacchus, no! Good Bacchus, be not slow To keep them back beyond the floe Of Danube's waters, where the snow Bites at the toe: Good Bacchus, wine, thy gift, I know Before I drink it, like the rose That over leagues of India grows; I scent from far, but here my nose Rebels and fancies he-goats; well! These Kelts that live among our foes Take corn for grapes, and with some spell Corrupting it, make this strong drink— But stay, I think The potion makes my senses blink! THE CANDIDATE. AFTER THE ANTIQUE. Light-girded Phœbus, Phœbus, here Beside thy gold-shod feet I shear My boyhood's hair so fair, so long My mother's joy, behold it there, Gone from me like my nurse's song! A man from hence, O let me wear Thy dark leaves round my temples bare, Give me the ivy crown to-day, Place in my hand the bough of bay! THE SPHYNX. I. 'Tis said that Homer, blind and old, Wandered round the great lone Sphynx: I see him blind and all alone, Grope round that vast misshapen stone To discern the sense untold, The answer from our ear that shrinks, The mystery no hand can hold. Did he discover even the shape— Feel what the giant mass expressed— Recognise the eyes agape— Know what the monstrous claws confessed? Poet of poets, greatest one Born of the Hellenic sun, Who made the grand song still we sing, Groping blindly and alone Round that arcane misshapen stone; Did it tell thee anything? II. The description of the Virgin and Child sleeping between the paws of the statue is derived from a picture by M. Olivier Mersson, now in the large gallery built and filled with works of the French school by Mr. Duncan of Benmore, near Kilmun, on the Clyde. The poet old we still revere, Passed to sing of sword and spear. In a long thereafter year, The holy Child, as Scriptures say, Into Egypt fled away To find repose a year and day: And in the night, Beneath the saffron-hued moonlight, Against the saffron-coloured sky, The Sphynx stood their steps too to greet: And Mary, with the Child divine, Slept between its mighty feet, Sheltered there as in a shrine; Behold, the light From out the Child, the Child divine, Shone up into the vast wide eyes, And made the arching eyelids bright Against the darkening midnight skies. NATURE. [I.] From home did then the infant come When it came here? Do we return unto that home Beyond the day we disappear? Then this fair Earth is but the place Where goal to goal We run a race, And Nature, dame with sun-browned face, Is but step-mother to the soul. Step-mother, dear full-breasted queen! When the true mother hides unseen, The naked suckling to thy heart Thou pressest: never would he part Could he but remain, I ween! II. On a rock limpet-crusted, one still day We sat; the sun upon the white sea shone; Ripples like living arrows came right on From rock to rock; a mist harmoniously United earth and heaven in silvery-grey. I said, there's nought to wish for more; but she, The loved one, my companion, smiled at me; Yet she too by the charm was borne away. Alas, this charm was broken by my deed;— I strike the limpets off to see them fall, And by strange instinct drawn from far, crabs speed Along the water floor, crabs all astir, To tear the limpets from their shells! A pall Was lowered 'tween Nature and our faith in her. HORTUS PARADISI. I. ‘Feeble waifs on darkling strand; Lost the power of heart or hand; Better the vilest starveling slave, In daylight other side the grave; Would that I, like thee, could go!’ So said the king of Grecian men To his questioner below. But a mightier teacher rose Over Calvary's empty tomb, And haply then That future country lost its gloom; More lovely in that world than this, Immaculate the white lily grows, And perfected we walk in bliss. II. ‘When blooms are best, they 'gin to go!’ Our moralising gardener said; Yes, it must indeed be so, Thus nature's cycle must be read. But if the longing of the heart Is to be listened to at all, 'Tis merely sad from friends to part, When the face turns against the wall. The curtain falls this side the sun, But we upon the farther side Shall find another walk begun With flowers as fair on fields as wide. If this hath been so from of old, What multitudes of souls wake there! Their earth-like motives dead and cold, With other names, if names they bear. Thus we grope this side the sun, Blind-folded children play just so: Time is eternity begun, ‘When blooms are best, they 'gin to go.’ III. MICHAEL ANGELO. Perhaps,—the future still must be The great Perhaps,—love still will reign Beyond the dark unsounded sea, Sympathy be our guide again. Perhaps some difference will remain Between the weaker and the strong, So we may recognise, regain, The greater chiefs of art and song. Perhaps a single one at least Of all the race! If this is so, Then we shall know our great high-priest, Our strongest, Michael Angelo. ST. COLUMBA. When Columba brought his band From old Erin's Christian land To Iona's rock-bound strand, He brought for each a sack of corn And a grinding-stone, as well As book and bell. Then every morn Each one alternate, great or small, From the saint to little Saul, Ground the daily meal for all: For Christ said once in Galilee, The greatest shall the servant be. Now when it came the master's turn, Little Saul's kind heart did burn To see him shut his book and go Alone into that granarie; Alone, but lo Once in, an angel shut the door, And set him down the quern before, Saying, ‘My father, I am here Even as a son, To do for thee as thou hast done For the heathen dark and poor, Whereby ye gave our Lord good cheer. I am strong, but thou art great, So thus at thy right hand I wait, And here I be, To grind this morning's meal for thee, If thou wilt read the morning's psalm, I too may need the balm.’ These words the brethren heard below, The quern then with great force did go, And the saint began also To read the psalter sweetly slow: Jesu pie auctor lucis Sis dux nobis viâ crucis. Crowding around the planken door, Through hinge and seam, upon the floor They saw the angel: wing and hair, And the garment that he wore, Were all one colour they declare, Yellow as flowers the sea-flags bear. Supplicantem audi chorum, O rex Jesu angelorum. In joyful silence, one and all Upon their knees these brethren fall, Till ceased the noisy grinding-stone, And lo! Columba was alone. OF ME. Our grandsire poets often prayed All the nine muses for their aid! But I, who only wander round Familiar ground, By pleasant autumn hedges bound,— Sure I can pray For inspiration much more near; My audience dear, Assist me to a theme to-day! You cannot help me? but I see I have a readier prompter here, The child is whispering in my ear, ‘Write a pretty thing of me!’ I will, you egotistic gnome, The best is often nearest home. LITTLE BOY. I. Little boy, whose great round eye Hath the tincture of the sky, Answer now, and tell me true, Whence and what and why are you? And he answered, ‘Mother's boy.’ Yes, yes, I know, But 'twas not so Six years ago. You are mother's anxious joy, Mother's pet, But yet— A trouble came within the eye That had some tincture of the sky. II. I looked again, within that eye There was a question, not reply— I only shaded back his hair, And kissed him there; But from that day There was more thinking and less play; And that round eye, That had a tincture of the sky, Was somewhat shaded in its sheen; It looked and listened far away, As if for what can not be seen. III. When I turned about and cried, But who am I Prompting thus the dawning soul? I cannot hide The want of a reply, Though travelling nearer to the goal Where we take no note of time: I can only say I AM, A phrase, a word, that hath no rhyme, The name God called Himself, the best To answer the weak patriarch's quest. IV. Why talk nonsense to a child?’ Asks the mother from the fire, Listening through both back and ears, Listening with a mother's fears:— Already is he something wild, Says that he can fly down stair! I do desire You questioning men would have a care,— He is my child, my only one, You'll make him try to touch the sun!’ BAGATELLE. I play so false, my hand and sight Are both at fault: you win of right; Let's change the scene; so deep, so clear, The sky is, yet few stars appear; And one black field the whole earth lies; I must confess that great moon's light Took me with a keen surprise. Thou Moon, because thou art so white, We call thee patient, pure, and wise, Alone too in this vast wide night, Blue-black the colour of death's fold,— We call thee goddess: unshared might Is thine, supreme, without emprise, Above all taint of wrong or right! While we in manifold disguise, Shut within this lamplit hold, Play trivial games in time's despite, To make life shorter and less cold. MARE SERENITATIS. There is a void mysterious space Upon the full moon's face They call Serenity's dead sea; Changeless and blank it seems to be Amidst continuous change elsewhere, Untouched by tides or waves of air, Volcanic craters yawning round. What breathless monsters harbour there, If any life at all may dare, Their iron lungs in silence bound, Silence for ever and profound! The little boy with thinking eyes, Steals inquiringly to me:— Tell you more of that moon-sea I pointed out in last night's skies? But more no man can ever know, We must not think of it at all,— For if by sympathy I go Too near that breathless sea, dear elf, 'Tis very likely I shall fall Into breathlessness myself. A GENIUS? (W. A. C. S.) In early morn he rose elate, Rose up with the strength of ten, We recognised a king of men. He would not linger, could not wait, Opened at once the golden gate And entered to the unlit shrine, Poured out, yea, drank, the lustral wine. But soon he found daylight more fair Than the closed sanctum's darkened air; That the world outside was wide; That in all time there is a tide; That it is best to serve the call To do what's waited for by all; That it is something less than sane What has been done to do again. Back he turned without a sigh, And threw his magic passport by. He said, ‘I am not asked for there, My harvest grows, it seems, elsewhere, Upon another hemisphere.’ I wait him still, but wait in vain, I shall not see his face again. THE TWO SIDES. Life is a fardel filled with care— Life is beautiful everywhere— Life is, alas, a compromise— Life is boundless like the skies— Life goes with music to each part— All minor notes that wound the heart— At life's feast Hebe's self appears— Life is God's chalice filled with tears. Yes, yes, ye both are right, pardie! It well may be, The gorgeous gold of sunset's glare Is mid-day grey and cold elsewhere. SELF-ACCUSATION. The impressive symbol of the conscience following the accused like his Double, is from a drawing by my late brother David Scott. ‘I shall not think of it again,’ He said, but took with him the pain Starting for a distant goal: Years after, in another land, He took my hand, And said, ‘I think of that deed still, Though on this further side the hill.’ I made this image of his soul. Along a wave-lashed darkling strand I saw a naked creature run, And like himself another one, Alike in shape, alike in size, But darker and with fierier eyes, Ran with him just one step behind, With equal speed against the wind, Filling his footprints on the sand Of that restless ever-sounding sea: And there, alas, they still may be. THE SUN-DIAL. I. Let us read this ancient thing, The bronze plate on our dial stone: Here's Father Time upon the wing. His scythe too by which all is mown: Here stars and zodiac signs profound Are graven all the circle round: A moralising motto too In Latin cut, but not quite new, Completes the decorated ring. How many golden days there are In this our life-year's calendar! Each one diverse is with some, As with the traveller far from home; With others show they all one strain, Like a child's white daisy-chain, Or a book without a stain, And sooth to say, without a dower. By the shadow of the Past, Upon the sun-smit dial cast, We know the Present passing hour. Why should the motto then be new, To decorate this dial stone, With that thin green moss overgrown? It is enough if it be true. II. Around this sun-dial daughter May Sometimes holds a holiday; She is the matron, makes the tea; The kettle by the gnomon stands: We think the scene right fair to see, As all scenes are when love commands. I am too old for such a sphere, Yet comet-like I venture near, And so, perhaps, I overhear Their talk of books, or of the play Our laureate made but yesterday, In which the Terry speaks a prayer To great Diana Hecate, A prayer that makes the bridegroom fear There's dangerous thunder in the air. Then daughter May, I do declare, Repeats comments I made myself, Yet is not in the least aware Each word was mine, the innocent elf! A maiden soul whose heart is free A crystal globe is, where we see Prophetic visions flash and fly. And here's the little boy too, he Must make himself a pleasantry! He almost blushes, feels too shy To sit in that sweet company: ‘I am the only gentleman,’ He said to nurse, and off he ran, But soon we found him mounted near, Where hid he could both see and hear: Already, very strange indeed, In his small heart is sown Love's seed! MORALITY. I. The watcher watching from within! To know him well, we scarce can win, Because the eye looks out, not in. Call him Soul or what you will, This watcher watching from within, From his involved and secret cell Can oftentimes but faintly tell What is the wrong and what the right, What may be good, what may be ill, Which is the sin and which the crime; Life moves between these, Ill and Good Can interchange, well understood, As angel Day and dæmon Night Divide for us our earth-born time. II. Besides, 'twas God's progressive plan Before we straightened up to Man, The instincts ruled in place of mind: And even now, although consigned The late born reasoning soul to serve, They obey the Sympathetic Nerve,— Inherited anatomies still Ordering our acts against our will. A GHOST. In the first watch of the night, One candle all my light, I saw a Spirit near the door Standing raised above the floor, In the air he was, yet standing, Feet placed flat as on some landing; So I turned my elbowed chair. He stood still there,— Like tarnished silver, dark yet bright, And edging his crisp hair, His hands,—whatever parts were bare, Except the soles of his firm feet, Passed a line of phosphor light: Then noiselessly I rose to greet My visitor as it was meet; I had no fears; His lips moved not, yet answered he, Nor did I hear him through the ears; Ah, would I could Repeat again his speech to Thee! It satisfied and strengthened me, It was Æolian too, I heard, But yet I think he spoke no word. A LOWLAND WITCH BALLAD. ‘A Lowland Witch Ballad’ is founded on a rhyme still to be heard in the neighbourhood of Tintock hill. It is given as follows in Chambers's ‘Popular Rhymes:’— On Tintock tap there is a mist, And in the mist there is a kist, In this kist there is a cap, And in the cap there is a drap. Take up the cap, drink aff the drap, And set it again on Tintock tap. The small flowering weed, the Circe, or Magician's Nightshade, also introduced in the ballad, has the power attributed to it of making any one accepting it as a gift in love with the giver. The old witch-wife beside her door Sat spinning with a watchful ear, A horse's hoof upon the road Is what she waits for, longs to hear, The mottled gloaming dusky grew, Or else we might a furrow trace, Sowed with small bones and leaves of yew, Across the road from place to place. Hark he comes! The young bridegroom, Singing gaily down the hill, Rides on, rides blindly to his doom, His heart that witch hath sworn to kill. Up to the fosse he rode so free, There his steed stumbled and he fell, He cannot pass, nor turn, nor flee; His song is done, he's in the spell. She dances round him where he stands, Her distaff touches both his feet, She blows upon his eyes and hands, He has no power his fate to cheat. ‘Ye cannot visit her to-night, Nor ever again,’ the witch-wife cried; ‘But thou shalt do as I think right, And do it swift without a guide. ‘Upon the top of Tintock hill This night there rests the yearly mist, In silence go, your tongue keep still, And find for me the dead man's kist. ‘Within the kist there is a cup, Thou'lt find it by the dead man's shine, Take it thus! thus fold it up,— It holds for me the wisdom-wine. ‘Go to the top of Tintock hill, Grope within that eerie mist, Whatever happens, keep quite still Until ye find the dead man's kist. ‘The kist will open, take the cup, Heed ye not the dead man's shine, Take it thus, thus fold it up, Bring it to me and I am thine.’ He went, he could make answer none, He went, he found all as she said, Before the dawn had well begun She had the cup from that strange bed. Into the hut she fled at once, She drank the wine;—forthwith, behold! A radiant damozel advance From that black door in silken fold. The little Circe flower she held Towards the boy with such a smile Made his heart leap, he was compelled To take it gently as a child. She turned, he followed, passed the door, Which closed behind: at noon next day, Ambling on his mule that way, The Abbot found the steed, no more, The rest was lost in glamoury. MORNING. Fair morn, whose promise never dies, Distributor of gifts, fair morn! She seems to blow a magic horn, From the conscious tops of hills, That makes the world lift glad fresh eyes, All the trees quiver, and the rills Leap forward with a child's surprise: The spell of dreams Fades before that magic voice, Nature calling to rejoice, Everything in earth or air, Answers everywhere, Making rainbows span the skies, Scattering flowers on hastening streams, Fulfilling prophecies. SILENCE. Speech is silver, silence gold: Speech goes out, Speech roams about, To market flies, is bought and sold: Silence at home spins fold on fold, Folds thick or thin To wrap her in, Thoughts strong or weak, Spins she round her body bare. Having nothing else to wear: But speech is silver, silence gold! Why should we speak? HERO-WORSHIP. How would the centuries long asunder, Look on their sires with angry wonder, Could some strong necromantic power Revive them for one spectral hour! Bondsmen of the past are we,— Predestined bondsmen: could we see The dead now deified, again Peering among environing men, We might be free! ROSE-LEAVES. Once a rose ever a rose, we say, One we loved and who loved us Remains beloved though gone from day; To human hearts it must be thus, The past is sweetly laid away. Sere and sealed for a day and year, Smell them, dear Christina, pray; So nature treats its children dear, So memory deals with yesterday, The past is sweetly laid away. PARACELSUS. Prayerless from the sacred well, From Castaly and Hippocrene, He drank, and on the verge of hell Slept, and forgot where he had been, When he returned to common day, Baptized by Hecate! He was the aeronaut who flew Through skies becoming black like night, Above the wrack and mountain range: Saw his own shadow on the white Cloud-world below that dazed his sight, And with his lapsing sense scarce knew That moving phantom, phantom strange, Was his own shadow. It was he Who lay in fever frenziedly, And chased the printed flowers that shed A mad confusion round his bed, Until at last they changed and past Into vermin round the dead. RABELAIS. ‘Go,’ said the Cardinal Bellay, ‘See how my doctor fares to-day.’ The page skipped off from house to house, But entered like a noiseless mouse, Hearing the priest read near the bed, Where the patient lay as dead; So just within the door he said— ‘My lord the Cardinal Bellay Asks how the doctor fares to-day?’ The young voice touched the wandering head: ‘Say he's about to take the leap: Within the dark— About to sleep,— Would that be better?— He must go To solve the great Perhaps, just so— Tell him that’— ‘Dear brother, nay,’ The good priest rising up did say, ‘Beati qui in Domino Moriuntur!’— ‘Well then, stay,’ Muttered the dear old Rabelais; ‘Bring it me at once, my friend, I never would the church offend, It hangs upon that peg you know, By all means bring my domino.’ A SIMILE. I. Like wayward flocks of lambs and sheep, We Clouds upon the soft warm sky, Over hamlet, vale, or steep, Gather or scatter, faint or fly, White and bright from land to land, From hill to hill, by light winds fanned: As travellers loitering on their track, Or bather slumbering on his back, Children of the sun-god are we O'er harvest champaign, teeming sea; In this the noontide of our day We laugh at change, yet must not stay. II. Oh blood-red change! all passed away, All passed with him the lord of Life: We, hid in blank night, well-a-day! Powerless, lost to joys or strife, Lost to ourselves, lost, lost are we, By soulless winds on soulless sea, Swathed, blindfolded, rolled along Beyond man's voice or angel's song, Unseen e'en by cold stars we hie Far up within black wastes of sky, Wrapped in shrouds of darkest spun, Never more to see the sun. OF POETRY. I. THE POET. The poet has been called of old, Maker, seeker, finder, singer: Which of these names, I would be told, Best describes our best joy bringer. Maker? not more than he or she Who makes your gloves or makes my tea. Seeker? yes, too oft I fear, So call not him we hold so dear. Singer? never is he set To music but it makes him fret. Finder? yes, he finds the word We leap to meet whenever heard, The best of living words, that linger In the warmth about the heart, Warm it comes beneath his finger, Never more with it we part. II. THE POET'S BOOK. The harmonies the poet knows Are like the petals of this rose, Leaf over leaf so pure, so bright, So perfumed in crimson light, Another still, they still combine, Like verse on verse and line on line. Silent he hides within his book, Like hermit wise in sainted nook, A sheath'd sword, unseen bird in bower— The nightingale in night's high tower, A voice not wandering but held close Within the petals of his Rose. III. ART FOR ART'S SAKE. ‘Art for art's sake,’—very well, Your picture you don't care to sell? Yes, yes, I do, and thus I try To paint so bright they want to buy— ‘Art for art's sake,’—then I fear You want no sympathetic tear From the stalls and boxes here? Yes, yes, I do, I write it so, A hundred nights the crowds shall go— ‘Art for art's sake,’—Heavens! once more, You'd say again things said before? And pray, why not? I wish I could Stand as Shakespeare, Fletcher, stood— Nay, dear aspirant, rather write As Shakespeare were he here to-night; That would be far more worth prizing:— But who can rise to that high pass— Who can rise? alas, alas, Shakespeare little thought of rising! IV. ANCIENT FORMS. Such, valued friend, you tell me these Old forms, like pictures Japanese, Are neat and curious, justly please; Difficult also. Without doubt To dance in chains, or spite of gout, Is difficult, painful too; but that Is weak; the thought is speech's law And poet's bond; He's no mere verbal acrobat. Should every flower have but one frond, Two blooms, three seeds, without a flaw? The poet has some sweet thing to cry— Well, let him speak straight from the heart, And so its fairest shades impart Harmoniously: Spontaneous speech sets faith at ease: But full-grown men now take small part In our linguistic filagrees, Our squeezing truth into a mould, That may but inexactly hold. You think so too, yet tell me still These verses unforeseen, at will Running like a running rill,— Verses free as if they grew, For ears refined will scarcely do. That is a pity, dilettanti Sometimes of brains, not ears, are scanty; An amateur once said to me, ‘Frame makes the picture, do you see!’ I smiled and could not quite agree— ‘But you're the painter! answered he; So I'm the poet, born or made, And were I not the least afraid, To show my great hope quite unfurled, I'd say we write for all the world. Oh, if you go so fast, so high, Sweeping the cobwebs from the sky, I shall no further make reply. V. ON READING MR. THEODORE WATTS' SONNET, ‘THE SONNET'S VOICE.’ The theory of the English form of the sonnet, as indicated here, has, I see, been expressed more at length by Mr. T. Hall Caine in the preface to his ‘Three Centuries of Sonnets.’ Mr. Theo. Watts's admirable sonnet, ‘The Sonnet Voice,’ which first appeared in the Athenæum 17th September 1881, is republished in that work. An art grows up from year to year: The critic weighs the utmost gains, The last result, the perfect sphere, Not the steps, but what remains; Sees the analogue, ebb and flow,— Beautiful, yes, look at it near,— The flow, the ebb returning so,— It is at last art's perfect sphere. But not the less our Shakespeare knew Another way; by full discourse To show his picture as it grew, Worked out in many-sided force. Then when the heart can wish no more, With a strong couplet bars the door. VI. REMONSTRANCE. (ON SOME POEMS NOW WITHDRAWN). Of all my favourite leaves these three Appear to me The wisest in their own degree,— But my good arbitress would hear No more, she stopt her ear, And said, ‘That surely cannot be, They are so sad, so hard to see,— Philosophy is not poesy.’ No, not oftentimes, alas, And yet the obverse ought to hold, Ere the poet can be crowned with gold: At least for once, pray, let them pass, Indeed you ought, They cost their maker so much thought: Perhaps the lines are wingèd seeds! ‘Perhaps they are, but then of weeds!’ Of weeds? then weeds medicinal. ‘But still would I their flight recall, Physic is only for our needs! Let us to the garden go, In the garden roses grow.’ OF POETS. I. STRATFORD. Perhaps the last lines of this poem may remind some readers of Shakespeare's reputed reply to Ben Jonson:— JONSON. If but stage actors all the world displays, Where shall be found spectators of the plays? SHAKESPEARE. Little or much of what we see we do, We are all actors and spectators too. This is the street where Shakespeare's childhood grew To Shakespeare's manhood, back to which he drew, To walk in peace along the paths he knew. At morn and eve of quiet days To hear the small birds' well-known lays, To see the bat flit noiselessly, And rooks against the molten sky, He passed the loud-mouthed audience by, And left to all the winds of fate The poet's immortality, Yea, even to the green-room care Heminge and Condell had to spare. So act the strong self-centred great! ‘Children we are as ye,’ they say, ‘Players, spectators, for life's day, Which are the masters of the play?’ II. SHAKESPEARE. Give me but fame! the poetaster cries, Standing on tiptoe so to touch the skies. Why gather empty shells by God's ebb-shore, Vital no more, Records of what has been, what matter they? My soul's in mine own hand to-day;— Quoth Shakespeare, and to Stratford bent his way. III. THE KESSELSTADT MASK. (FROM AN ARTISTIC POINT OF VIEW). That round-cheeked, flat-faced Stratford bust Sank one's ideal to the dust, But heaven be praised, for by its grace We have found our Shakespeare's face. Gerard's own bust they well could spare, So they mounted it up there! As for the portrait by Droeshout, Perhaps his fingers had the gout! But here's the king of men divine,— The Elizabethan profile line,— Let Gerard and Droeshout give place— We have found our Shakespeare's face. IV. DANTE. I. Before the dawn of modern day, Saint Francis and Saint Dominic Forgathered on sweet Fiesole. They waled from all the young and quick The tenderest heart on all the earth, Now, said they, this thin heart and we Shall make a bond, and it shall be 'Tween poetry and sulphurous fear; Nor any more shall love make mirth In Italy our garden dear, Nor manhood's virtues hold a part In our Italian rhythmic art. So then, from market or from well, The women ran when Dante passed, The cruel sight-seer back from Hell Had borne with him an evil blast; And though from Paradise at last He brought some flowers of asphodel, The compact hath not passed away Made then upon sweet Fiesole. V. DANTE. II. A celtic saint the tale once told,— Ere Dante's birth the tale was old— That he in faith, with mortal eyes Had been uplifted through the skies, And saw the winged in Paradise. He had been hand led down below Where Purgatorial sulphurs flow, And round the furthest confines there Had seen the vast high wall of Hell: But not even angel-guides could tell What horrors Satan might prepare For inmates at the Judgment-knell; As yet it was a waste, no soul Till then might reach that hopeless goal, But Dante forestalled time, full well He knew the pits and filled all Hell. VI. DANTE AND BEATRICE. Ah, did she pass so coldly by The tenderest love in all the earth, Making his lifetime one long sigh, That never knew a morn of mirth? High up the Paradisal stair Did he refind amidst the glare This matron's breast without a heart, Transformed to Theologic Art? Ah, well for us 'tis not our part In England's fresher, stronger air, To shrine this saint-elected pair, This mythologic, cleric dream, Instead of Shakespeare, our supreme, Humane, and multiform, and clear, Exhaustless, blood-red, near and dear. VII. WORDSWORTH. Earth! through whom we come and go, Mother of Prometheus! fair. Thy temples rose in warmer air, Thou many-breasted, ever young, To sounding cymbals wast thou sung Two thousand years ago; Yet here again The wisest man of many men, The truest bard of latest days Has made his life thy hymn of praise. VIII. SOUTHEY. ON READING ‘THE LIFE,’ BY PROFESSOR DOWDEN. Job heard a sweet sound, Job awoke, And saw a faint white light, He turned, he deemed the night was spent, 'Twas but the first watch of the night, Day had not broke, It was Jehovah's angel spoke, Bright in the opening of the tent. Job, the Lord hath heard your prayer, And sends me here to thee, I bear Your recompense, which shall it be, Goodness or Greatness? say and see. Job knelt, Lord, give me charity, The rest perhaps will come to me. He looked, the angel was no more, Job rose in purple from the floor. IX. BURNS. HIS COTTAGE AND MONUMENT. This is the cottage as it was of old, The window four small panes, and in the wall The box-bed where the first daylight did fall Upon their new-born infant: narrow fold And poor, when times were hard and winds were cold As they were still to him. And now close by Above Corinthian columns mounted high, The famed Choragic Tripod shines in gold! The lumbering carriages of these dull years Have pass'd away, their dust has ceased to whir Round the pedestrian, silent to our ears Is that maelstrom of Scottish men, this son Of that poor cot we count the kingliest one; Such is time's justice, time the harvester. X. CHATTERTON. Oh cruel night, that closed those questioning eyes,— Nay, kindly say, stars shine in darkening skies. Oh cruel night, that stopped those wondering ears,— Nay, kindly say, who knows what now he hears? XI. SAPPHO. Sisters! sisters Nine and mine! Take my latest lustral wine; This lyre no more to be attuned by me, I dedicate, Alas, too late, Brass-hearted Artemis, to thee; And this, my weary body, to the sea. XII. ORPHEUS. Thy mother, Calliope, gave thee power Over the heart of man, above the laws Of savage nature: in the perilous hour Over the triple Dog's dismembering claws; Ixion leant a moment on his wheel, And Tantalus forgot his thirst to feel, When thy voice throughout hell began to peal: But not the Nine, nor even the Gods, can save Their best-beloved children from the grave. XIII. BYRON. He was Childe Harold pacing there The dark deck of that exile-ship, When twenty years scarce fringed his lip, Pacing in a boy's despair. He was Don Juan, not too soon Sent from the glimpses of the moon. And had he lived a little longer, He would have risen greater, stronger; King of the Greeks, he had been then Agamemnon, King of men. Yet not the best of warriors he Who crossed towards Troy the Ægean sea. XIV. SHELLEY. I. The three words yet to dominate This world with peace and love elate, We rede upon the ruined wall Palatial, Once the witless Bourbon's pride, Words written large from side to side; And on the pavement where we stood Lay fratricidal blood. What wonder then eyes fixed so far,— Faith and to-day so coiled in war,— Directest steps may go amiss? Inspiréd speech be vague as his? Yet shall these three words be one day, Our full-grown manhood's rondelay, The sensitive plant shall surely grow Beside the myrtle and the bay, When we with him have passed away, And shall not know. XV. SHELLEY. II. That reason-born millennium, He thought so near, shall surely come, Shall come when days have longer grown, And nights are longer too, When bread from richer tilth is mown, And all our powers are born anew: Millions of years far off, may be, Eons of ages, it shall come, But then the Poet men may see Shall throw all our poetics dumb. For then, as now, the poet's lyre Must shine with light as well as fire; And he sings best whose clear plain song Beats with our hearts and makes us strong. THE FALLING LEAF. That leaf, the earliest of the year To fall, hath dropped upon your hair, I saw it wavering in the air, Then drop as if directed where! Vain fancies! it bodes nought to fear, Even let it lie;— Doubtless to you, to me, to all From out eternity, Hours all foredoomed are hastening near, Although they are not to be seen Against the sky, Nor do we hear a doomster call! Yet this first leaf to fall though green, Upon your head, my daughter May, Hath fallen to-day! LEFT ALONE. I pace the garden paths alone, Waiting till the close of day; It is not well aloud to moan, So end I this small book straightway. Silence goes with me gently here, Within, it sits wrapped round with fear. So, gloaming-lit I walk and pray Now to be led in God's right way, And made to say Even thus His will, not mine, be done, Though not the less the mid-day sun Has lost for me its light and heat; His will, and only His, is meet. AUBADE. That sycamore leaf! I knew it fell Upon my heart as well As on the head of my dear May, And I have brooded all the night In fear I would be left alone With all my thoughts as cold as stone, Fancying what words to say. But with the blessed gift of light The faint delusions passed away, I raised the casement to the thrill Of morn, a bird upon the sill Alit and sang a song so gay, Its echo follows, follows still: So all night's phantoms fly with day. A GARLAND, FOR ADVANCING YEARS. Wear thou this fresh green garland this one day, This white-flowered garland wear for Love's delight, While still the sun shines, ere the lessening light Declines into the shadows cold and grey: Wear thou this myrtle leaf while yet ye may, Love's wings are wings that hate the dews of night, Nor will he rest still smiling in our sight, And still companioning our western way. Wear then this plain green garland this one day, To please Love's eyes, else not for all the might Of all the gods, nor any law of right, Will he, content with age's disarray, For us pass by the youthful and the gay; And it were hard to live in love's despite. AN AUTUMN EVENING. Dinner and day together go, As round the table still we dwell, Watching the sun descending slow, Our faces shine with day's farewell. This is the moment of all time When stillness reigneth over all: When life calms down, the highest lime Moves not, nor any leaf dares fall. Shall we sit still in low-voiced talk Anticipating lamp and book, Or once more take a sauntering walk Hill-ward to catch the sun's last look? The lambs and sheep have parted long, No anxious bleat nor moor-hen's call Is heard, nor robin's autumn song, Absolute stillness reigns o'er all. Over the orange-tinted brae, Against that wondrous north-west sky, Over the far sea golden-gray, Where no horizon we descry. A glorified world is there, behold, Above that cloud-bank growing dim, Where the great king hath laid his head, Fragments of crimson still unfold: Cherubim's wings are ruby red, So these may be the cherubim! Now we return with noiseless tread, These cottage doors are shut betimes, Listen, this is old John Grimes', He reads before he goes to bed; He reads a chapter of the Book Of Books, to comfort his old wife, Happily in this far Scotch nook, Faith still trims the lamp of life. But there our own high windows shine, The evening fire is lit we see, Wayfaring shoes let us resign, And you will sing that hymn to me. END OF HARVEST. They're in the corner of the field, The last field they shall have to shear, They've left and tied one bunch, ‘the hare,’ Called in harvest language here. So I shall leave my books and toys, My Nankin blues and other pets, For still to pass on pleasantly One must pay dame fashion's debts. To give the prize, the silver coin, To him who hits the mark, or she, I hope indeed it may be Jane, Who makes the sickle rightly flee, To cut the bunch, to kill ‘the hare,’ The last grain cut of all the year: But no, it is douce Donald Bain, So rarely fate accords a cheer! Already the wide kitchen blooms With wreaths of evergreens and flowers, The solid roasts are almost done, To try their gathered festive powers. All disappear till evensong, And then we see the fiddle-case, With gay escort of twos and threes, Girls and their lovers drest with grace. The hour arrives, the ample board Is girt by young and old alike, Anon it disappears, and then Twenty pairs of hands they strike, The fiddler mounts, the dance begins, Now Jane could win the prize, I think, Scotch reel, mazurka, quadrille, waltz, She make's old Fergie's eyelids wink. The Drennens too, good sonsy pair, Passed their silver wedding day, Admired by their own children too, Dance with each other, dance alway. Now you and I, old Fergie, come, We elders may still try, you know, No, no! take Mysie, I've no breath, That indeed would make me crow! Too soon the tall house-clock strikes twelve, The lads and lasses hear it too, I leave them to their parting reel, And write this plain song, friend, for you. MEMORY. Last night I lost a word, the one Just wanted for my madrigal: Then went to bed disconsolate, Groping through a web half spun, Listening for sounds beyond recall: Unrhymed my ruined verses hung, Till I was lost myself—had won Within the silence-hingéd gate, The gate of horn: And lo, at morn I found the word upon my tongue. It was so in my school-boy year, When the lesson would not lie Within the jaded memory, With day-light it would reappear, Unravelled, clear. Perhaps 'twill be so that dread morn Far beyond the gate of horn; All we have said, or thought, or done, Like blades in a grass-field in the sun, Innumerable and clear each one, Will present be, no loss and no decay Of all our growth throughout life's play:— And that will be our Judgment day: Ourselves the judge, the judged, the soul To be advanced, from goal to goal! SEEKING FORGETFULNESS. And yet I am as one who looks behind, A traveller in a shadowed land astray, Passing and lost upon the boundary Of actual things, who turns against the wind, An hundred simulacral ghosts to find Close following, an hundred pairs of eyes Shining around like phosphorescent flies,— And all of them himself, yet changed in kind. Those once I was, which of them now am I? Not one, all alien, long-abandoned masks, That in some witches' sabbath, long since past, Did dance awhile in my life's panoply, And drank with me from out of the same flasks; And I not rid of these, not even at last? CONTINUITY OF LIFE. Nay, let me own it is but vain regret, Not wise, to disavow life's unity, To cry out, Oh, it was a child, not I, It was a boy, it was a lover's fret Caught in the magic of a golden net, It was a run-away tracked by a hound He needs must slay, must tread into the ground,— Groping about to find some oubliette. It was the very self, the self indeed, Said the true word or thought the treacherous thought; The very self fate-driven, did the deed That won the prize, or black-crowned doomster brought: And thus it is we look beyond the shore That girds our isle, while Hope flies on before. EXPERIENCE. Steadily burning like a lamp enshrined, The Sanscrit says our lives should pass away; Even so, but how to guard by night and day This priceless lamp? From the Unknown God's wind Fans it for ever, joys and cares combined, The plague of fire and hail, in through the bars Of this our prison-house make constant jars; No heart of flesh can hold their powers confined. Not then for us in Western lands is it, Where every hour brings loads enough for years, Naked on contemplation's mat to sit; But wee to him who finds no time at all For questioning, who sleeps in a festive hall; Who finds no gains in long-remembered tears. AGE. ‘Stepping westward,’ did she say, At sunset on that long Scotch day? ‘Stepping westward,’ yes, alway, With staff and scrip, Wayfaring songs upon my lip, Stepping, stepping, to the end. As down the slanting path I wend, Behold, a breadth of distant sea, Between the hills on either hand, Ships bearing from some unknown land To other land unknown to me. ‘Stepping westward,’ all that be, Body and soul, by land or sea, Follow still the westering sun; That must end which has begun. BIRTHDAY, ÆT. 70. So many years I've gone this way, So many years! I must confess Waste energies, much disarray, Yet can I own no weariness, Nor see I evening's shadows fall Down my much inscriptioned wall: The warm air still is like mid-day, And many mournful ghosts are past, Laid still at last. The fabled fardel lighter grew As near the bourne the bearer drew: Life can, alas, no more surprise By its continuous compromise. New faces fill the chairs, and so Our interest in the game runs low. Quiet pleasures longest stay, Experience packs so much away. I wait and wonder: long ago This wonder was my constant guest, Wonder at our environing, And at myself within the ring: Still that abides with me, some quest Before my footsteps seems to lie, But quest of what I scarcely know, Life itself makes no reply: A quest for nought that earth supplies, This is our life's last compromise. So many years I've gone this way, It seems I may walk on for aye, ‘Long life God's gift,’ a brother prayed, Nearing the confines of the dead, Going reluctant, not afraid: With bated breath I bow the head Thinking of those vague words to-day. The ancient tempter well divined This longing of the sunlit blind, ‘Ye shall be wise as gods,’ he said, If ye obey me undismayed. Ah, never may this be, though still In hope we climb the topless hill. 'Tis but the ending of the strife Calms and crowns the weary head, Nor till the morn beyond our life Can life's oracle be read, When the unanswered brain and heart Have ceased to ask and ceased to smart: And all the centuries to come Like centuries past to us be dumb. A-DIEU. Farewell, it is not much to say When bright night follows pleasant day, And when the traveller takes the way From friendly hearth to hearth of friend, But yet with each change we portend Some grief, some hand-long cloud of care We ought to shelter from or share: Parting eyes are over-kind, The lamb-lost ewe's bleat fills the air, The plover's plaint is in the wind. EPILOGUE. HERE then I draw my linked rein; These months have filled the farmer's wain, Filled too my small portfolio, I need not wait the threatening snow: Already on the steep Goatfell Forebodingly we mark it well, And leafless is the garden Bower, Shed is every gentle flower. The swallows have gone south, we too Will go, and to these verses new I add some old ones, one or two. 'Tis said what's new is seldom true, And what is true can scarce be new. I hope indeed it is not so, But year by year fresh flowers shall blow, For poets still to bring to you. An Aftermath. INTRODUCTORY SONNET. MADAME ROLAND AT THE FOOT OF THE SCAFFOLD. “Give me a pen, I will not hold you long, But I have some few words that I would say Before I mount, before I pass away, Following my friends all gone; it is not wrong What I would write, nor any foolish song, But now I stand beside the shoreless sea, A word or two from out my heart would flee Not said before, that coming death makes strong.” How many have felt thus besides the brave Fair queen of womankind, the good Roland: Life's long years past, both joyous years and grave The wish descends upon the untired hand To leave some self-drawn picture, or some stave Of speech for those left waiting on the strand. NEW YEAR BELLS. TWO EPOCHS. I. 1831. Long years ago, when love was lord of me And all good gifts were in the impending year, At this same hour I heard afar and near These New Year bells flood heaven with melody: I, home bound through the snow, as over sea Voices of dear friends hail the mariner Returning prosperous: till in their rear Saint Paul's great voice made lesser voices flee. What mattered then beneath those hopeful bells The homeward walk by weary fortune given, The obscure future whersoever driven, In years to come; all lost in those sweet knells High overhead, like messages from heaven. TWO EPOCHS. II. 1881. Ring out again, ye Bells of Battersea, Over the seaward Thames while I sit here Lamplit, with moistened eye and hungering ear, Recalling thoughts of things once hoped to be— Past now, forgotten almost; for to me Those wild harmonies in the waves of air, Changing yet still repeating, here or there, Yet truly ordered, ring life's history. And still I hear them lovingly, good bells, Across the rushing river in the wind, Fainting or rising as the tempest swells; The river rushing like dark years behind Chasing dark years gone by, and those sweet spells High overhead with memories intertwined. RHYME OF LOVE. Early astir in this midsummer time In the Queen's close, sweet hour in this sweet clime, I stray at will to hear the throstle sing Among the trees that round her garden cling; I, Ronsard, in my youthood's joyous prime, And by the Queen's desire, beneath the lime She loves, to sing to her again the rhyme, The daintiest of all the rhymes I bring, My rhyme of Love. But yet despite this July's leafy time, The Queen's praise, birds' songs, odourous rose and thyme, This heartache close to me, so close, will cling Because, forsooth, the blue-eyed Lize took wing When I yestreen began my daintiest rhyme, My rhyme of Love. SPRING. Welcome, Spring, too long delayed, Kindest, most reluctant maid: Sweetest of younger sisters, simplest one Of the bare bosomed chorus of the year. Now last season's beech-tree leaf Hath fallen. The crocus sends her spear Up through the earth, a little span Each day increasing to a sheaf. The housewife sings the damsel's song, The old man whistles like the boy, Aches no more his limbs annoy, He steps out like a sower strong. Sweetest of younger sisters, odourous tressed Forcefully wooed by sharp-hoofed breezes, Spring! Thy advent knows each living thing Through the dense deep earth impressed With love's light touch of wondrous flame, That sense and soul revives the same. Summer, with her proud silence and her haze Of heat, her gracious shadows, and her maze Of leaves and undergrowths and rills Dropping asleep beneath the cloudless hills, Hath no such kindly wing As thou, bird-hatching Spring. Autumn, with her boisterous mirth Shaking the red-ripe fruit upon the earth, Shedding the rose leaves, each eve shedding too From saddening clouds and stars great drops of dew, Hath not the prophet tongue, Like thine, thou ever young, Young as a child, thou bride more fair, Innocent as a blush, and strong As a lion in a poet's song. May I then venture near thee, in thy hair To place this pink-edged daisy, Sweet? Alas, 'tis mortal even there, Mortal but saintly Margarite. The heedless sheep goes browsing on, The daisy from the grass is gone. Matron Summer is coming anear, To crown the still inconstant year: But ere thou flyest, blue-eyed Spring, It suits us well to bring, Bound by this withy of poetry, An offering of thine own flowers to thee. WM. BLAKE'S DESIGNS FOR THE GRAVE. SEEN AFTER MANY YEARS. There was a time before the chick could fly, But still was screened by the maternal wing, He worshipped these as if they held a spring Of living waters. Had not God on high Shown innocent William what it was to die, Made him to know the rapture of the pain, When soul and body part to meet again: Dread truths concealed within futurity. And now that years have shriven and tortured me, When labouring much in thriftless fields hath filled The tablets of my memory, these burn With their old fires, within them still I see A hand inspired, though in his Art unskilled; My heart leaps up, my childhood's awes return. CHRISTIANITY AND PAGANISM. ROME. TIME OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM. Then face to face the New Faith and the Old, The new Faith promising endless reign Beyond the catacombs and martyr's pain; The mystic doctrines sacraments enfold The scorn of learning, the contempt of gold. The Old Faith, fancy's foundling, faith of heart, Lighting small lamps to Lares, by the art Of potter or of sculptor bought and sold. This is the day of Triumph: lo, this hour Titus the conqueror enters, raised on high The sacredest of Trophies borne to-day By brutal soldiers, from them gone the power: Yet over all the wide world goes the cry, Awake! ye blind, arise, go hence away! INFANCY. SUGGESTED BY A RAILWAY ACCIDENT. “Let him lie still,” the young wife cried, “right soon I shall be back,” and on my lap she laid Her swaddled nurseling; startled even dismayed, I looked down on the face like a white moon, On the closed eyes and open mouth, no spoon Had yet touched, and could see its breathing made The folds expand in which it was arrayed: It was alive, yet knew not night from noon. Beautiful was it? I can scarcely say. I never held so young a thing before; But wonderful it was to me, and may Be likened to a shrine within closed door, Closed, unlit, but from whence a breath made way Te Deum laudamus, saying o'er and o'er. AN ANNIVERSARY: THE 31st. ADDRESSED TO A DEAR FRIEND. Spring comes with all the firstlings of the year Leaping around her, careless of the cold; Soon summer's tale so charming will be told, The last rose fall, the sun shrink as in fear; Alas, the weeks fly faster, and more near Yule seems to Easter, when the hair grows gray, Sooner it seems the swallows fly away, And wintry floes brim full the shivering weir. What matters it, these are old ills we know That pass us by as Chronos gives command: But still your smile is bright as long ago, Still can we gather shells on life's lee shore, We still can walk like children hand in hand, Friendship and love beside us as of yore. DANTE IN EXILE. In life we judge and estimate, With our dearest even debate, And strive to hold the balance true Between the brown eyes and the blue. But with the dead we do not so; Shrined in the past we let them go Their mystic journey high and far, Until they pass the starlit bar Dividing gods from things below: And thus at last on chancel stones We worship before empty thrones. Could we wind back the skean of time Ere Giotto's tower could bellman climb, We might see Gemma, weary wife, Nursing her babes in threadbare quoif— One, two, three, four—alas they're seven, Left to the charities of heaven! We might see Dante, foiled in strife, Thankless over strangers' bread, Raking hell's fires on the dead; Casting back on Florence fair His bloodshot eyes, a hateful stare. Not wise in guile or strong of arm, To shield himself from bale or harm; With powerless hate and childish lies Inventing undreamt cruelties. THE INFERNO. A celtic Saint this tale first told, Ere Dante's birth the saint was cold, But he in faith with mortal eyes Had been uplifted through the skies And seen the winged in Paradise. Then was he hand-led down the stair Where Purgatorial sulphurs flare, And round the furthest confines there Had seen the copeless walls of Hell, But not even angel-guides could tell What horrors Satan might prepare For sinners at the Judgment knell. At that time 'twas a waste, no soul Till the last day could reach that goal! But Dante forestalled time, too well He loved the pits, and loved the spell Of friends and foes foredoomed to hell. Alas! must we, at this late time, Make our good God act Satan's part, Accepting that accursed rhyme, Forgiving blasphemy for art? Is our paternal God displayed In these vile cruelties arrayed? Or is the poet before heaven, Guilty of that sin ne'er forgiven? RAPHAEL'S MADONNA DI SAN SISTO. Once and once only, and no more, Art hath reached the topmost bough; The goodliest fruit of all his store Our well-filled garner holds till now. Lo! from a life-filled atmosphere She comes with silent step, with mild And plaintive eyes bent sadly here Holding her prize of prizes, her man-child, King of the world-expected year, Safe within her queenly arms Above all harms. Once and once only, and no more, Out of the sensuous classic night, Born of the dusk mid-christian lore, Into our midday's questioning light: Behold! Ideal womanhood, Maternity, supremely good, Self sacrificing, without stain; Goddess eternally serene, Yet robed in thoughtful mortal mien; And once, no more, the painter's art Hath touched this mystery on the heart. Behold her here, untouched by pain But with foreknowledge of the day Still far away In darkness on the mount of death Defiled by malefactor's breath— When “It is finished” he shall cry, And the immortal seem to die. Finished? nay, but just begun Beneath the sun. Look at him here a child to-day. MERRY ENGLAND. England was merry in old times? Indeed! When the worn ploughman might not leave the ground Where he was born, and where his children found His old shoes and nought else for all their need; When “Benefit of Clergy” saved the deed Of blood from punishment, and once a year Men climbed a greasy pole for Christmas cheer, And once in twelve months got one plenteous feed. Merry in sooth! Astronomy was then Astrology, the chemist's craft again Was alchemy, and every crone grown old Died as a witch, and you or I, sad fate! Had given to fat Mass John our scantiest gold For his old gown to mask us at heaven's gate! THE AUTO DA FE. I. SAINT DOMINIC. Saint Dominic had a vision: Mary mild Stood by him shining in her robes of light, And warned him fire and sword, the law of might, Should spread the faith and worship of her child. Time passed, and holy Church the faggots piled. In Italy, in fair Provence, in Spain, Prayer was torn up with groans, blood fell like rain, Pity and brotherhood thenceforth exiled. And I too had a vision of the night: Appalled by shrieks I rose awake! red light Burst from a pit of fire, and far down there, While those still rang like a dom-church bell, I saw a carcase in the quivering lair: Dominic it was in Dante's fieriest cell. II. TORQUEMADA. I rose in bed, repeated like a child The dear Lord's prayer; a candle lit, and read The Sermon on the Mount, until my head Sank on the pillow; then too soon beguiled By the same fever-sleep, again the wild Horror of death-by-fire, eternally Prolonged, possessed my senses, and the cry Rang up, the shrieks returned; around me coiled That vision of the pit, the pit of doom, Where two still living corpses now consume, Struggling together with their talons thrust Into each others eye-holes filled with dust. 'Twas Torquemada in the maddening gloom, And Dominic, struggling in their murderous lust. CARDINAL NEWMAN. I. Good, learned, wise, in some sense; but to-day Can we accept a Christopher, poor knight, For guide, or take his lanthorn for the light To guide our pathway, and so shunt away Whole centuries with their severe assay Of all the past; as if dark night were kin To Christian wisdom, and the soul within Was lost when powerful knowledge holdeth sway? Can we ignore our birthright, on the back Of packhorse can we seek the dead monk's cell, And by the rush-wick in the thick fish-oil, Let subtle Thomas and Duns Scotus rack Our brains till common night-wind seems a coil Of devils, and we trust some mad old spell! Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.—Henry VI., Part 2, Act iv. II. Good Newman? well! he gives the devil his due, Honours the Pope, whose chartered power can save Gnostics like him on t'other side the grave, If they but trust nought else, resign all clue God-given through nature, holding only true Traditional Rites, and with sealed eyes contrive To shut out reason from their cloistered hive, And what our mighty science teaches new. But are they not right happy to have found This haven? Ask the smile their thin lips feign When workers tell of all the toils and fears Manhood exacts each step of stable ground. Ask the brave triumphs, the material gain To civilization for a thousand years. THE SICKLE. AN AUTUMNAL ODE. I. Reach the old Sickle from the wall Where it hath hung so long. The reaper's re-awakening song Sounds the autumn's annual call, Bewildering the watchful hare In his yet unhunted lair. Dear old Sickle, once again The undergrowth of poppies red, Whose beauties on themselves were shed, Shall dazzle soon the trembling air, When the wheat-ears over head Across thy curved blade have lain, In triumph as the reaper's eye Smiles to his fair mate jocundly. Sacred old Sickle, while the wind Died on the winter's crisped rind, And the mossed thatching o'er the door Was whiter than now is the mill's white floor, Thou broughtest July's sun to mind: And so, when May-day breezes blew, And made each building bird renew The search for straws and sticks, 'twas thou For whom we blessed the fledgeling bough, Then through high summer's long bright eves Sat the dear saint Tranquility, Longing to see them gild the sheaves, And, bread-rich Sickle, glance on thee Over the villager's shoulder flung, Love-making fieldward, blythe and young. II. Most potent sun, how beautiful Old harvest days have been, With health and peace, the garner full, The fields more yellow than green; When upwards thrown on the arch that leaps The fly-frequented stream, Where the tired midday traveller sleeps, Danced ever-more the ripple's gleam, And on its ledge a white-haired child Sat for idling hours beguiled, Peeping down right cautiously A glimmering water friend to see Smiling from beneath, with hair Like his own but still more fair. Beside him laid the bunch of grain, His earnings in the gleaning train Then seen through hedge-rows here and there, Gay in their sun-bright rustic dress, Where the binder rears the sheaves At intervals in grouped caress, Joking wisely as he leaves Each rustling girth of fruitfulness, And the looped-up damsels go Far down the field, now fast, now slow, Now resting in the sultry air, Or throwing back betimes their hair As it falls before their eyes When they stoop or when they rise. III. Beloved Sickle, thou hast been Where lyre or sword were never seen, And round thee, like the ivy screen Around a faun's brown knotted hair, Clung hopes and fears and blessings rare. In a warmer clime In a distant time A goddess held thee in her hand About whose head's immortal band Were braided ears of bearded corn, More loved than even the halo borne By Phœbus or than Dian's horn. Round this maternal-goddess' shrine There was a flower-encircled glow Of fruitage and of wine, To her the autumnal overflow Was borne with hymns divine. This goddess is departed now, No more she guides the timely plough, It grides along alone: No more men light her temple dim, Aud the consecrating hymn, Dear Sickle, long hath been thine own. IV. The goddess gone! ah, no more here But wrapt up with our school-boy gear Of dactyl and trochee, no more On this side of the Stygean shore! The Sickle too, when I was young, A doleful when, so long ago! Was polished bright though never sung. But now alack, it too must go Among forgotten things too slow For these our frantic hours of speed: No more the boast of kirtled maid, It rusts among the long decayed; Nor more, like Ruth, the gleaner need Stoop her flexile back to-day. Make clear the way! The grand machine with man and steed, And countless knives and clash of steel, Passing on its dangerous fray, Makes the child run, the old man reel. Nor there the end, with welcome sway From prairies vast the steamship braves The grim Atlantic's mightiest waves, Filled with grain from that far land. The farmer turns his eyes away, The Sickle dropping from his hand VOICES OF SUNSET CLOUDS. 1ST. Sister with the crimson crest And broad wings of every die, Come ye from the eagle's nest, On the mountain turrets high, Or from kissing the lake below Swimming thus so softly slow? Round thy folded feet the breeze Languishes in blissful ease, Holding his breath for beauty's sake Till he hath passed thee unawake. Our father-sun is gone to sea, Come thou after him with me. 2ND. Sister, yes, we shall entwine Our arms and wings, both thine and mine, Then wait for me, too fast you stray Adown that steep though golden way To the far home of yesterday. Behold! the messengers are still Shedding flame on wave and hill; Shield me in thy saffron vest, So may we in its folds be pressed Together, and together move Like lovers in their day of love, With like colour, and like motion, Across that fearful, glittering ocean. 1ST. Foot to foot and hand to hand, Over sea as over land: Hark, the children on the strand Are singing at their evening play. Can you hear them, what they say? 2ND. They are too far, too far away: But still I see them on the sand Run before the breaking spray, And I can see the curfew bell Swinging in the fretted spire, Lit up in a bright farewell, Like a pyramid of fire. 1ST. But now, oh sister, what are these, So many and so swift, astray Up hither far from fields and trees? They dart right through us like a breeze With forked tails, strange birds are they. 2ND. Swallows are they following Our father-sun to a warmer land; Swallows, swallows, strong of wing, Seeking Afric's heated sand— Already they have passed away, Lost until another spring. 1ST. Another spring! another year! But we are only for a day— Already I am faint with fear. Behold those fishermen return Home across the darkening bay, Their oars give off that ghastly spray Where the shoreward surf they spurn. 2ND. For a day, ah well you say Only for a single day. Dank and cold And shapeless grows thy mantle's fold. But where art thou? gone, gone from me Over the wind-swept darkening sea, Alas, and I must follow thee. A LAST WALK, IN ILLNESS. Let's close the book, and underneath the blue Stepping again where innocent daisies grow, Sweet daisies the child's playthings long ago; Feel the spring wind as then it briskly blew, And hear as then we heard the shrill curlew; Make friends with the slow cow upon the lea, And seated on this height behold the sea. Dear ancient sights, for me again so new. The darkening sea, alas! night comes apace, The sun hath touched his cloud-strewn misty goal; To-day as every day he wins the race: Homeward we turn, homeward we still must look When Nature, the stern step-dame of the soul, Closes for evermore life's half-read book. THE FURTHER SHORE. Life's half-read book, for we are well aware We cannot know it to its furthest end: But still we hope the coming page may mend Its story, and our sun shine out more fair; That infant laughter may light age's care; That Good and Evil's ravelled skeins shall blend In closer harmony like friend with friend, And God's love never leave us anywhere. But now the book is closed, the dusk falls low Upon the unknown sea: For me no more The Pleiades and Bear will shine: I go; My unknown home is on the further shore, And when my darkened eyes mark nought below The Mighty Hand shall guide me as before.
