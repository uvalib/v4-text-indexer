Farewell thy printless sands and pebbly shore! I hear the white surge beat thy coast no more, Pure, gentle source of the high, rapturous mood! — — Where'er, like the great Flood, by thy dread force Propell'd—shape Thou my calm, my blameless course, Heaven, Earth, and Ocean's Lord!—and Father of the Good! TO THE RIGHT REV. FATHER IN GOD JONATHAN, LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH, WHO, IN A LEARNED, FREE, AND LIBERAL AGE, IS HIMSELF MOST HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED BY EXTENSIVE, USEFUL, AND ELEGANT LEARNING, BY A DISINTERESTED SUPPORT OF FREEDOM, AND BY A TRULY CHRISTIAN LIBERALITY OF MIND, THIS POEM, WITH ALL RESPECT, IS DEDICATED BY HIS LORDSHIP'S MOST OBLIGED AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. Jan. 1788. LEWESDON HILL. Up to thy summit, Lewesdon, to the brow Of yon proud rising, where the lonely thorn Bends from the rude South-east with top cut sheer By his keen breath, along the narrow track, By which the scanty-pastured sheep ascend Up to thy furze-clad summit, let me climb,— My morning exercise,—and thence look round Upon the variegated scene, of hills And woods and fruitful vales, and villages Half hid in tufted orchards, and the sea Boundless, and studded thick with many a sail. Ye dew-fed vapours, nightly balm, exhaled From earth, young herbs and flowers, that in the morn Ascend as incense to the Lord of day, I come to breathe your odours; while they float Yet near this surface, let me walk embathed In your invisible perfumes, to health So friendly, nor less grateful to the mind, Administering sweet peace and cheerfulness. How changed is thy appearance, beauteous hill! Thou hast put off thy wintry garb, brown heath And russet fern, thy seemly-colour'd cloak To bide the hoary frosts and dripping rains Of chill December, and art gaily robed In livery of the spring: upon thy brow A cap of flowery hawthorn, and thy neck Mantled with new-sprung furze and spangles thick Of golden bloom: nor lack thee tufted woods Adown thy sides: tall oaks of lusty green, The darker fir, light ash, and the nesh tops Of the young hazel join, to form thy skirts In many a wavy fold of verdant wreath:— So gorgeously hath Nature drest thee up Against the birth of May: and, vested so, Thou dost appear more gracefully array'd Than Fashion's worshippers, whose gaudy shows, Fantastical as are a sick man's dreams, From vanity to costly vanity Change ofter than the moon. Thy comely dress, From sad to gay returning with the year, Shall grace thee still till Nature's self shall change. These are the beauties of thy woodland scene At each return of spring: yet some delight Rather to view the change; and fondly gaze On fading colours, and the thousand tints Which Autumn lays upon the varying leaf: I like them not, for all their boasted hues Are kin to Sickliness; mortal Decay Is drinking up their vital juice; that gone, They turn to sear and yellow. Should I praise Such false complexions, and for beauty take A look consumption-bred? As soon, if gray Were mixt in young Louisa's tresses brown, I'd call it beautiful variety, And therefore dote on her. Yet I can spy A beauty in that fruitful change, when comes The yellow Autumn and the hopes o'the year Brings on to golden ripeness; nor dispraise The pure and spotless form of that sharp time, When January spreads a pall of snow O'er the dead face of th'undistinguish'd earth. Then stand I in the hollow comb beneath, And bless this friendly mount, that weather-fends My reed-roof'd cottage, while the wintry blast From the thick north comes howling: till the Spring Return, who leads my devious steps abroad, To climb, as now, to Lewesdon's airy top. Above the noise and stir of yonder fields Uplifted, on this height I feel the mind Expand itself in wider liberty. The distant sounds break gently on my sense, Soothing to meditation: so methinks, Even so, sequester'd from the noisy world, Could I wear out this transitory being In peaceful contemplation and calm ease. But Conscience, which still censures on our acts, That awful voice within us, and the sense Of an Hereafter, wake and rouse us up From such unshaped retirement; which were else A blest condition on this earthly stage. For who would make his life a life of toil For wealth, o'erbalanced with a thousand cares; Or power, which base compliance must uphold; Or honour, lavish'd most on courtly slaves; Or fame, vain breath of a misjudging world; Who for such perishable gaudes would put A yoke upon his free unbroken spirit, And gall himself with trammels and the rubs Of this world's business; so he might stand clear Of judgment and the tax of idleness In that dread audit, when his mortal hours (Which now with soft and silent stealth pace by) Must all be counted for? But, for this fear, And to remove, according to our power, The wants and evils of our brother's state, 'Tis meet we justle with the world; content, If by our sovereign Master we be found At last not profitless: for worldly meed, Given or withheld, I deem of it alike. From this proud eminence on all sides round Th' unbroken prospect opens to my view, On all sides large; save only where the head Of Pillesdon rises, Pillesdon's lofty Pen: So call (still rendering to his ancient name Observance due) that rival Height south-west, Which like a rampire bounds the vale beneath. There woods, there blooming orchards, there are seen Herds ranging, or at rest beneath the shade Of some wide-branching oak; there goodly fields Of corn, and verdant pasture, whence the kine Returning with their milky treasure home Store the rich dairy: such fair plenty fills The pleasant vale of Marshwood, pleasant now, Since that the Spring has deck'd anew the meads With flowery vesture, and the warmer sun Their foggy moistness drain'd; in wintry days Cold, vapourish, miry, wet, and to the flocks Unfriendly, when autumnal rains begin To drench the spungy turf: but ere that time The careful shepherd moves to healthier soil, Rechasing, lest his tender ewes should coath In the dank pasturage. Yet not the fields Of Evesham, nor that ample valley named Of the White Horse, its antique monument Carved in the chalky bourne, for beauty and wealth Might equal, though surpassing in extent, This fertile vale, in length from Lewesdon's base Extended to the sea, and water'd well By many a rill; but chief with thy clear stream, Thou nameless Rivulet, who, from the side Of Lewesdon softly welling forth, dost trip Adown the valley, wandering sportively. Alas, how soon thy little course will end! How soon thy infant stream shall lose itself In the salt mass of waters, ere it grow To name or greatness! Yet it flows along Untainted with the commerce of the world, Nor passing by the noisy haunts of men; But through sequester'd meads, a little space, Winds secretly, and in its wanton path May cheer some drooping flower, or minister Of its cool water to the thirsty lamb: Then falls into the ravenous sea, as pure As when it issued from its native hill. So to thine early grave didst thou run on, Spotless Francesca, so, after short course, Thine innocent and playful infancy Was swallowed up in death, and thy pure spirit In that illimitable gulf which bounds Our mortal continent. But not there lost, Not there extinguish'd, as some falsely teach, Who can talk much and learnedly of life, Who know our frame and fashion, who can tell The substance and the properties of man, As they had seen him made,—aye and stood by Spies on Heaven's work. They also can discourse Wisely, to prove that what must be must be, And show how thoughts are jogg'd out of the brain By a mechanical impulse; pushing on The minds of us, poor unaccountables, To fatal resolution. Know they not, That in this mortal life, whate'er it be, We take the path that leads to good or evil, And therein find our bliss or misery? And this includes all reasonable ends Of knowledge or of being; farther to go Is toil unprofitable, and th' effect Most perilous wandering. Yet of this be sure, Where freedom is not, there no virtue is: If there be none, this world is all a cheat, And the divine stability of Heaven (That assured seat for good men after death) Is but a transient cloud, display'd so fair To cherish virtuous hope, but at our need Eludes the sense, and fools our honest faith, Vanishing in a lie. If this be so, Were it not better to be born a beast, Only to feel what is, and thus to 'scape The aguish fear that shakes the afflicted breast With sore anxiety of what shall be— And all for nought? Since our most wicked act Is not our sin, and our religious awe Delusion, if that strong Necessity Chains up our will. But that the mind is free, The Mind herself, best judge of her own state, Is feelingly convinced; nor to be moved By subtle words, that may perplex the head, But ne'er persuade the heart. Vain argument, That with false weapons of Philosophy Fights against Hope, and Sense, and Nature's strength! See how the Sun, here clouded, afar off Pours down the golden radiance of his light Upon the enridged sea; where the black ship Sails on the phosphor-seeming waves. So fair, But falsely-flattering, was yon surface calm, When forth for India sail'd, in evil time, That Vessel, whose disastrous fate, when told, Fill'd every breast with horror, and each eye With piteous tears, so cruel was the loss. Methinks I see her, as, by the wintry storm Shatter'd and driven along past yonder Isle, She strove, her latest hope, by strength or art, To gain the port within it, or at worst To shun that harbourless and hollow coast From Portland eastward to the Promontory, Where still St. Alban's high built chapel stands. But art nor strength avail her—on she drives, In storm and darkness to the fatal coast: And there 'mong rocks and high-o'erhanging cliffs Dash'd piteously, with all her precious freight Was lost, by Neptune's wild and foamy jaws Swallow'd up quick! The richliest-laden ship Of spicy Ternate, or that Annual, sent To the Philippines o'er the Southern main From Acapulco, carrying massy gold, Were poor to this;—freighted with hopeful Youth, And Beauty, and high Courage undismayed By mortal terrors, and paternal Love Strong, and unconquerable even in death— Alas, they perish'd all, all in one hour! Now yonder high way view, wide-beaten, bare With ceaseless tread of men and beasts, and track Of many indenting wheels, heavy and light, That in their different courses as they pass, Rush violently down precipitate, Or slowly turn, oft resting, up the steep. Mark how that road, with mazes serpentine, From Shipton's bottom to the lofty down Winds like a path of pleasure, drawn by art Through park or flowery garden for delight. Nor less delightful this—if, while he mounts Not wearied, the free Journeyer will pause To view the prospect oft, as oft to see Beauty still changing: yet not so contrived By fancy, or choice, but of necessity, By soft gradations of ascent to lead The labouring and way-worn feet along, And make their toil less toilsome. Half way up, Or nearer to the top, behold a cot, O'er which the branchy trees, those sycamores, Wave gently: at their roots a rustic bench Invites to short refreshment, and to taste What grateful beverage the house may yield After fatigue, or dusty heat; thence call'd The Traveller's Rest. Welcome, embower'd seat, Friendly repose to the slow passenger Ascending, ere he takes his sultry way Along th'interminable road, stretch'd out Over th'unshelter'd down; or when at last He has that hard and solitary path Measured by painful steps. And blest are they, Who in life's toilsome journey may make pause After a march of glory: yet not such As rise in causeless war, troubling the world By their mad quarrel, and in fields of blood Hail'd victors, thence renown'd, and call'd on earth Kings, heroes, demi-gods, but in high Heaven Thieves, ruffians, murderers; these find no repose: Thee rather, patriot Conqueror, to thee Belongs such rest; who in the western world, Thine own deliver'd country, for thyself Hast planted an immortal grove, and there, Upon the glorious mount of Liberty Reposing, sit'st beneath the palmy shade. And Thou, not less renown'd in like attempt Of high achievement, though thy virtue fail'd To save thy little country, Patriot Prince, Hero, Philosopher—what more could they Who wisely chose thee, Paoli, to bless Thy native Isle, long struggling to be free? But Heaven allow'd not—yet may'st thou repose After thy glorious toil, secure of fame Well-earn'd by virtue: while ambitious France, Who stretch'd her lawless hand to seize thine isle, Enjoys not rest or glory; with her prey Gorged but not satisfied, and craving still Against th'intent of Nature. See Her now Upon the adverse shore, her Norman coast, Plying her monstrous labour unrestrained! A rank of castles in the rough sea sunk, With towery shape and height, and armed heads Uprising o'er the surge; and these between, Unmeasurable mass of ponderous rock Projected many a mile to rear her wall Midst the deep waters. She, the mighty work Still urging, in her arrogant attempt, As with a lordly voice to the Ocean cries, ‘Hitherto come, no farther; here be staid ‘The raging of thy waves; within this bound ‘Be all my haven’—and therewith takes in A space of amplest circuit, wide and deep, Won from the straiten'd main: nor less in strength Than in dimensions, giant-like in both,— On each side flank'd with citadels and towers And rocky walls, and arches massy proof Against the storm of war. Compared with this Less, and less hazardous emprize achieved Resistless Alexander, when he cast The strong foundations of that high-raised mound Deep in the hostile waves, his martial way, Built on before him up to sea-girt Tyre. Nor aught so bold, so vast, so wonderful, At Athos or the fetter'd Hellespont, Imagined in his pride that Asian vain, Xerxes,—but ere he turn'd from Salamis Flying through the blood-red waves in one poor bark, Retarded by thick-weltering carcasses. Nor yet that elder work (if work it were, Not fable) raised upon the Phrygian shore, (Where lay the fleet confederate against Troy, A thousand ships behind the vasty mole All shelter'd) could with this compare, though built It seem'd, of greatness worthy to create Envy in the immortals; and at last Not overthrown without th' embattled aid Of angry Neptune. So may He once more Rise from his troubled bed, and send his waves, Urged on to fury by contending winds, With horned violence to push and whelm This pile, usurping on his watry reign! From hostile shores returning, glad I look On native scenes again; and first salute Thee, Burton, and thy lofty cliff, where oft The nightly blaze is kindled; further seen Than erst was that love-tended cresset, hung Beside the Hellespont: yet not like that Inviting to the hospitable arms Of Beauty and Youth, but lighted up, the sign Of danger, and of ambush'd foes to warn The stealth-approaching Vessel, homeward bound From Havre or the Norman isles, with freight Of wines and hotter drinks, the trash of France, Forbidden merchandize. Such fraud to quell Many a light skiff and well-appointed sloop Lies hovering near the coast, or hid behind Some curved promontory, in hope to seize These contraband: vain hope! on that high shore Station'd, th' associates of their lawless trade Keep watch, and to their fellows off at sea Give the known signal; they with fearful haste Observant, put about the ship, and plunge Into concealing darkness. As a fox, That from the cry of hounds and hunters' din Runs crafty down the wind, and steals away Forth from his cover, hopeful so t' elude The not yet following pack,—if chance the shout Of eager or unpractised boy betray His meditated flight, back he retires To shelter him in the thick wood: so these Retiring, ply to south, and shun the land Too perilous to approach: and oft at sea Secure (or ever nigh the guarded coast They venture) to the trackless deep they trust Their forfeitable cargo, rundlets small, Together link'd upon their cable's length, And to the shelving bottom sunk and fixt By stony weights; till happier hour arrive To land it on the vacant beach unrisk'd. But what is yonder Hill, whose dusky brow Wears, like a regal diadem, the round Of ancient battlements and ramparts high, And frowns upon the vales? I know thee not— Thou hast no name, no honourable note, No chronicle of all thy warlike pride, To testify what once thou wert, how great, How glorious, and how fear'd. So perish all, Who seek their greatness in dominion held Over their fellows, or the pomp of war, And be as thou forgotten, and their fame Cancell'd like thine! But thee in after times Reclaim'd to culture, Shepherds visited, And call'd thee Orgarston; so thee they call'd Of Orgar, Saxon Earl, the wealthy sire Of fair Elfrida; She, whose happy Bard Has with his gentle witchery so wrought Upon our sense, that we can see no more Her mad ambition, treacherous cruelty, And purple robes of state with royal blood Inhospitably stain'd; but in their place Pure faith, soft manners, filial duty meek, Connubial love, and stoles of saintly white. Sure 'tis all false what poets fondly tell Of rural innocence and village love; Else had thy simple annals, Nethercombe, Who bosom'd in the vale below dost look This morn so cheerful, been unstain'd with crimes, Which the pale rustic shudders to relate. There lived, the blessing of her father's age,— I fable not, nor will with fabled names Varnish a melancholy tale all true,— A lowly maid; lowly, but like that flower, Which grows in lowly place, and thence has name, Lily o' the vale, within her parent leaves As in retreat she lives; yet fair and sweet Above the gaudiest Blooms, that flaunt abroad, And play with every wanton breath of Heaven. Thus innocent, her beauties caught the eye Of a young villager, whose vows of love Soon won her easy faith: her sire meantime, Alas! nor knowing nor suspecting ought, Till that her shape, erewhile so graceful seen, (Dian first rising after change was not More delicate) betray'd her secret act, And grew to guilty fulness: then farewell Her maiden dignity, and comely pride, And virtuous reputation. But this loss Worse follow'd, loss of shame, and wilful wreck Of what was left her yet of good, or fair, Or decent: now her meek and gentle voice To petulant turn'd; her simply-neat attire To sluttish tawdry: her once timid eye Grew fix'd, and parley'd wantonly with those It look'd on. Change detestable! For she, Erewhile the light of her fond father's house, Became a grievous darkness: but his heart Endured not long; all in despair he went Into the chambers of the grave, to seek A comfortless repose from sorrow and shame. What then befell this daughter desolate? For He, the partner of her earliest fault, Had left her, false perhaps, or in dislike Of her light carriage. What could then befall, What else, but of her self-injurious life The too sad penance—hopeless penury, Loathsome disease unpitied, and thereto The brand of all-avoided infamy Set on her, like the fearful token o'er A plague-infested house:—at length to death Impatient and distract she made bold way. Fain would I view thee, Corscombe, fain would hail The ground where Hollis lies; his choice retreat, Where, from the busy world withdrawn, he lived To generous Virtue, and the holy love Of Liberty, a dedicated spirit; And left his ashes there; still honouring Thy fields, with title given of patriot names, But more with his untitled sepulchre. That envious ridge conceals thee from my sight, Which, passing o'er thy place north-east, looks on To Sherburne's ancient towers and rich domains, The noble Digby's mansion; where he dwells Inviolate, and fearless of thy curse, War-glutted Osmund, superstitious Lord! Who with Heaven's justice for a bloody life Madest thy presumptuous bargain; giving more Than thy just having to redeem thy guilt, And darest bid th' Almighty to become The minister of thy curse. But sure it fell, So bigots fondly judged, full sure it fell With sacred vengeance pointed on the head Of many a bold usurper: chief on thine (Favourite of Fortune once, but last her thrall), Accomplish'd Raleigh! in that lawless day When, like a goodly hart, thou wert beset With crafty blood-hounds, lurching for thy life, While as they feign'd to chase thee fairly down; And that foul Scot, the minion-kissing King, Pursued with havoc in the tyrannous hunt. How is it vanish'd in a hasty spleen, The Tor of Glastonbury! Even but now I saw the hoary pile cresting the top Of that north-western hill; and in this Now A cloud hath pass'd on it, and its dim bulk Becomes annihilate, or if not, a spot Which the strain'd vision tires itself to find. And even so fares it with the things of earth Which seem most constant: there will come the cloud That shall infold them up, and leave their place A seat for Emptiness. Our narrow ken Reaches too far, when all that we behold Is but the havoc of wide-wasting Time, Or what he soon shall spoil. His outspread wings (Which bear him like an eagle o'er the earth) Are plumed in front so downy soft, they seem To foster what they touch, and mortal fools Rejoice beneath their hovering: woe the while! For in that indefatigable flight The multitudinous strokes incessantly Bruise all beneath their cope, and mark on all His secret injury; on the front of man Gray hairs and wrinkles; still as Time speeds on Hard and more hard his iron pennons beat With ceaseless violence; nor overpass, Till all the creatures of this nether world Are one wide quarry: following dark behind, The cormorant Oblivion swallows up The carcasses that Time has made his prey. But, hark! the village clock strikes nine—the chimes Merrily follow, tuneful to the sense Of the pleased clown attentive, while they make False-measured melody on crazy bells. O wond'rous Power of modulated sound! Which, like the air (whose all-obedient shape Thou makest thy slave), canst subtilly pervade The yielded avenues of sense, unlock The close affections, by some fairy path Winning an easy way through every ear, And with thine unsubstantial quality Holding in mighty chains the hearts of all; All, but some cold and sullen-temper'd spirits, Who feel no touch of sympathy or love. Yet what is music, and the blended power Of voice with instruments of wind and string? What but an empty pageant of sweet noise? 'Tis past: and all that it has left behind Is but an echo dwelling in the ear Of the toy-taken fancy, and beside, A void and countless hour in life's brief day. But ill accords my verse with the delights Of this gay month:—and see the Villagers Assembling jocund in their best attire To grace this genial morn. Now I descend To join the worldly crowd; perchance to talk, To think, to act as they: then all these thoughts, That lift th'expanded heart above this spot To heavenly musing, these shall pass away (Even as this goodly prospect from my view) Hidden by near and earthy-rooted cares. So passeth human life—our better mind Is as a Sunday's garment, then put on When we have nought to do; but at our work We wear a worse for thrift. Of this enough: To-morrow for severer thought; but now To breakfast, and keep festival to-day. POEMS. INSCRIBED BENEATH THE PICTURE OF AN ASS. Meek animal, whose simple mien Provokes th' insulting eye of Spleen To mock the melancholy trait Of patience in thy front display'd, By thy Great Author fitly so pourtray'd, To character the sorrows of thy fate; Say, Heir of misery, what to thee Is life?—A long, long, gloomy stage Through the sad vale of labour and of pain! No pleasure hath thine youth, no rest thine age, Nor in the vasty round of this terrene Hast thou a friend to set thee free, Till Death, perhaps too late, In the dark evening of thy cheerless day, Shall take thee, fainting on thy way, From the rude storm of unresisted hate. Yet dares the erroneous crowd to mark With folly thy despised race, Th' ungovernable pack, who bark With impious howlings in Heaven's awful face, If e'er on their impatient head Affliction's bitter show'r is shed. But 'tis the weakness of thy kind Meekly to bear the inevitable sway; The wisdom of the human mind Is to murmur and obey. ODE TO THE LYRIC MUSE. SPOKEN IN THE THEATRE AT THE INSTALLATION OF LORD NORTH, CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. STROPHE I. Fair sov'reign of the golden lyre, Descend, Thalia, from th' enchanted grove Of Mona, where thou lov'st to rove, List'ning the echoes of thy Druid quire; The ling'ring sounds that yet respire Waked by the breezes of the Western main; And bring some high and solemn strain, Such as was heard that solemn day When Rome's dread Eagle stoop'd to prey On Mona's free-born sons, while Liberty Struck on the magic harp her dying song.— Dealing vengeance on her foes, The mortal Genius of battle rose, And call'd Despair and Death to lead her host along. STROPHE II. O, Muse divine! whene'er thy strain Devotes the tyrant head to shame, The Patriot Virtues brighten in thy train; And Glory hears the loud appeal; And thou, unconquerable flame, First-born of ancient Freedom, Public Zeal: Thou in the dark and dreary hour When Tyranny her dragon-wing outspread, And Sloth a sullen influence shed, And every coward Vice that loves the night Revell'd on Corsica's ill-fated shore; Thou didst one dauntless heart inflame, Lo, Paoli, father of his country, came, And with a giant-voice Cried, “Liberty!” unto the drowsy race That slept in Slav'ry's dull embrace; Roused at the sound, they hail'd thy glorious choice, And ev'ry manly breast Shook off the unnerving load of rest; And Virtue chasing the foul forms of night, Rose like a summer sun, and shed a golden light. ANTISTROPHE I. But, ah! how sunk her veiled head, Untimely dimm'd by Gaul's o'ershadowing pow'r— And shalt thou rise, fair isle, no more? Thy patriot heroes sleep among the dead: Thy gallant virtues all are fled; Save Fortitude, sole refuge from despair. O Gaul, Oppression's blood-stain'd heir, Let me not tell how, taught by thee, England's rude sons smote Liberty On Vincent's sable rock, her Indian throne:— Not unavenged; for in her cause the sky Storms and fiery vapours pour'd, While Pestilence waved wide his tainted sword To smite The remainder of this, and the whole of the second antistrophe, were not repeated in the theatre, having been suppressed by the academical authorities, on account of their political sentiments, and subsequently lost. EPODE. Then, O Thalia! let thy sacred shell Wake the lofty sounds that swell With rapture unreproved the patriot breast! Robed in her many-colour'd vest On Isis' banks shall Science stand, Waving in her bounteous hand A wond'rous chaplet; high reward Of toils, by public virtue dared: And while to claim the envied meed Fair Fame her vot'ries leads, thy voice, O Muse, shall join th' applauded choice That fix'd the glorious wreath on Frederick's honour'd head! VERSES INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN IN THE THEATRE TO THE DUKE OF PORTLAND, AT HIS INSTALLATION AS CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, IN THE YEAR 1793. In evil hour, and with unhallow'd voice, Profaning the pure gift of Poesy, Did he begin to sing, He, first who sung Of arms and combats, and the proud array Of warriors on th' embattled plain, and raised Th' aspiring spirit to hopes of fair renown By deeds of violence!—For since that time Th' imperious victor oft, unsatisfied With bloody spoil and tyrannous conquest, dares To challenge fame and honour; and too oft The poet, bending low, to lawless pow'r Hath paid unseemly reverence, yea, and brought Streams clearest of th' Aonian fount to wash Blood-stain'd Ambition. If the stroke of war Fell certain on the guilty head, none else, If they that make the cause might taste th' effect, And drink, themselves, the bitter cup they mix, Then might the bard (tho' child of peace) delight To twine fresh wreaths around the Conqueror's brow; Or haply strike his high-toned harp, to swell The trumpet's martial sound, and bid them on Whom Justice arms for vengeance: but, alas! That undistinguishing and deathful storm Beats heaviest on th' exposed innocent, And they that stir its fury, while it raves, Stand at safe distance, send their mandate forth Unto the mortal ministers that wait To do their bidding.—Ah! who then regards The widow's tears, the friendless orphan's cry, And Famine, and the ghastly train of woes That follow at the dogged heels of War? They, in the pomp and pride of victory Rejoicing, o'er the desolated earth, As at an altar wet with human blood, And flaming with the fire of cities burnt, Sing their mad hymns of triumph; hymns to God, O'er the destruction of his gracious works! Hymns to the Father, o'er his slaughter'd sons! Detested be their sword! abhorr'd their name, And scorn'd the tongues that praise them!—Happier Thou, Of peace and science friend, hast held thy course Blameless and pure; and such is thy renown. And let that secret voice within thy breast Approve thee, then shall these high sounds of praise Which thou hast heard be as sweet harmony, Beyond this Concave to the starry sphere Ascending, where the spirits of the blest Hear it well pleased:—For Fame can enter Heaven, If Truth and Virtue lead her; else, forbid, She rises not above this earthy spot; And then her voice, transient and valueless, Speaks only to the herd.—With other praise And worthier duty may She tend on Thee, Follow thee still with honour, such as time Shall never violate, and with just applause, Such as the wise and good might love to share. ON THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN COOK. I will not meditate in idle show Of labour'd lines my sorrow to relate; All artless as the tears my verse shall flow That good men weep for his untimely fate. The friends of peace and friends of human kind To mourn thy loss, adventurous Chief, agree; And all who love the bold or generous mind, And all who science love must weep for thee. By thee to soft Taheite's sultry clime, By thee to chill Kamschatzcha's frozen zone, And Isles ne'er view'd till George's golden time Britannia's mighty name at length was known. O how unlike Magellan! he who bent His daring sail to untried winds, and first The world encompass'd—save in sad event Of timeless death by savage hands accurst. The Arts of Peace He cared not to extend; For gold th' untravel'd sea his bark explored, For lust of gold he rashly strove to bend The free-born Indian to his lawless sword. Not such the generous purpose of thy will; With zeal untired and patient toil it strove To make th' untutor'd savage learn thy skill, And the fierce-manner'd tribes embrace thy love. For this thy vessel plough'd the stormy wave, For this the pendent globe thrice circled round, When the rude hand of some unconscious slave With brutal fury dealt the fatal wound. Hold! hold, Barbarian! shall the guilty strife Provoke to mortal acts thy frantic hand? Let fall thy stroke on some less-valued life; But save, O! save the Chieftain of the band! E'en hostile kings bade spare his honour'd head, The bloodless trophies of his fame bade spare; And Peace and Science wide their influence spread To guard him from the wasteful rage of war: In vain—he falls—he dies—behold him bleed— Ah wretched Isle! ah murderous, murderous race! The guilt, the memory of this ruffian deed What pains can expiate, or what time efface? Henceforth no ship shall spread her canvas wing To visit that inhospitable strand; Save that in after times if chance shall bring Some bark storm driven near the hateful land; Ev'n then the hardy mariner shall mourn; And as he views it rising from the main, Far from the inhuman shore his prow shall turn, Cursing the murderous isle where Cook was slain. ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF DR. W. HAYES, PROFESSOR OF MUSIC IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. Set to Music by his Son and Successor, P. Hayes. SYMPHONY. These sounds of grief, this solemn air, To thee I sing, dear, honour'd shade! Hear, spirit of my father, hear! To thee these mournful rites are paid. Here followed an Organ Movement, being a Psalm Tune of the Professor, Dr. Wm. Hayes. Such the last strains by thee were tried, Strains that to holy Choirs belong; While Age, that wasted all beside, Yet spared the sweetness of thy song. So pass'd he: nor approved alone In science; like his gentle art, His life was Music, and in tone With Virtue's harmony his heart. O! let thy tuneful Spirit, to hear The melancholy strains we raise, Now stoop from that celestial sphere Where Music is the voice of Praise! THE WORLD This was among the subjects for a Prize Poem, given out by Sir John and Lady Miller at Bath Easton.. INTENDED AS AN APOLOGY FOR NOT WRITING. BY A LADY. Wide Habitation of the Sons of Men, Wherein the seeds of vice and virtue lie Mix'd, like the undigested Elements Ere Chaos lost his kingdom; where blind Chance With Passion holds divided anarchy; O! who can rightly scan thee, or describe? Subject ill suited to a Virgin's Muse, That cannot praise, and is to blame untaught: Wherefore from this unprofitable theme She turns, leaving unsung its argument; Save that with careless hand her lute she strikes Lightly, nor hoping that the myrtle wreath Shall crown her unpremeditated lay. THE BRITISH THEATRE. Written In 1775. When first was rear'd the British Stage, Rude was the scene and weak the lay; The Bard explored the sacred Page, And holy Mystery form'd his Play. Th' affections of the mortal breast In simple Moral next he sung, Each Vice Personification of the passions in the moralities. in human shape he drest, And to each Virtue Personification of the passions in the moralities.gave a tongue. Then 'gan the Comic Muse unfold In coarser jests her homely art: Of Gammer Gurton's Gammer Gurton's Needle is the oldest English comedy; the distress of it arises from the loss of the needle, which at last is discovered in her man Hodge's breeches. loss she told, And laugh'd at Hodge's awkward smart. Come from thy wildly-winding stream, First-born of Genius, Shakspeare, come! The listening World attends thy theme, And bids each elder Bard There were no plays of any note before Shakspeare. be dumb: For thou, within the human Mind Fix'd, as on thy peculiar throne, Sitt'st like a Deity inshrined; And either Muse is all thine own! Yet shall not Time's rough hand destroy The scenes by learned Jonson writ; Nor shall Oblivion e'er enjoy The charms of Fletcher's courtly wit: And still in matchless beauty live The numbers of that Lyric Strain Sung gayly to the Star of Eve By Comus and his jovial Train. Here sunk the Stage:—and dire alarms The Muse's voice did overwhelm; For wounded Freedom call'd to arms, And Discord shook the embattled Realm. But Peace return'd; and with her came (Alas! how changed!) the tuneful Pair: Thalia's eye should blench with shame, And her sad Sister weep to hear How the mask'd The custom of that time, for fear of hearing indecencies, otherwise too gross to be supported. Fair, in Charles's reign, Her lewd and riotous Fancy fed At Killigrew's debauchful scene, While hapless Otway pined for Bread. Thus the sweet Lark shall sing unheard, And Philomel sit silent by; While every vile and chattering bird Torments the grove with ribald cry. And see what witless Bards presume With buskin'd fools to rhyme and rage; While Mason's idle Muse is dumb, And weary Garrick quits the Stage. ON TWO PUBLICATIONS, ENTITLED EDITIONS OF TWO OF OUR POETS. When Critic Science first was known, Somewhere upon the Muse's ground The pruning knife of wit was thrown; Not that which Aristarchus found: That had a stout and longer blade, Would at one stroke cut off a limb; This knife was delicately made, Not to dismember, but to trim. With a short harmless edge a-top, 'Twas made like our prize-fighting swords; Pages and Chapters 'twould not lop, But cut off syllables and words. Well did it wear; and might have worn Full many an age, yet ne'er the worse; Till Bentley's hand its edge did turn On Milton's adamantine verse. Warburton seized the blunted tool, Scarce fit for Oyster-opening Drab: For Critic use 'twas now too dull, But tho' it would not cut, 'twould stab; Then Shakspeare bled, with every friend That loved the Bard:—he threaten'd further; And God knows what had been the end, Had not Tom Edwards cried out “Murther!” Confounded at the fearful word, Awhile he hid the felon steel; Now gives it Mason, lends it H?; Ah! see what Gray and Cowley feel! THE SPLEEN. I am not of their mind who say The World degenerates every day; Nor like to hear a churl exclaim, In rapture at Queen Bess's name, And cry, “What happy times were those “When Ladies with the sun uprose, “And for their breakfast did not fear “To eat roast-beef and drink strong-beer! “Then buxom health and sprightly grace “Enliven'd every blooming face, “Blooming with roses all its own; “And rouge, tea, vapours, were unknown.” Nature, still changing, still the same, Hath so contrived this worldly frame, That every age shall duly share The good or ill that flows from Her. Thus we, a spleenful race, are free From magic and from sorcery; While those who lived with good Queen Bess (As they that know the truth confess) Tho' Spleen and Vapours there were none, Had Imps and Witches many a one; And he who, 'cause he has not seen, Will not believe, hath ne'er, I ween, With due attention mused upon Thy page, O British Solomon! Thus far in preface—Now I'll tell How Spleen arose, when Witchcraft fell. By vengeful laws the Wizard brood Long harass'd and at last subdued, Their black Familiars all repair Before the throne of Lucifer, With sad petitions, setting forth Their many grievances on earth, What torments they were doom'd to bear While tending on their Witches there: Some drown'd, to prove their innocence, Or, scaping, hang'd on that pretence; Some burnt within their steeple hats, Some nine times murder'd in their Cats: Brief, they petition'd to enjoy Some less adventurous employ, Since witchcraft now was thought so common They were not safe in an old woman. Their suit was granted—up they came New-liveried in sulphur flame, With licence thro' the realm to range; But, with their pow'r, their name they change. Magic no longer now is seen, And what was Witchcraft once, is Spleen: Yet still they most delight to vex, As first they did, the female sex; And still, like an old witch's charm, They tease, but have no power to harm. Tho' Doctors otherwise have told, The tale is true that I unfold: And with my system suits the name, For Spleen and Vapours are the same; And all the country people know That these, ascending from below, Are Devils of peculiar hue, And from their colour call them Blue. LINES WRITTEN WITH A PENCIL IN A LADY'S ALMANAC. Go happy lines, yet fearful go, To meet Louisa's secret eye! Tell what I wish her heart should know, Yet, rather than declare, I die. Perhaps she'll scorn ye, and despise The tribute of a heart so poor— Too valueless to be the prize Of Beauty, proudest conqueror. Then tell her that her touch alone Destroys your pencil'd forms with ease; And say your fate is like my own, To be or not, as she shall please. But should her gentleness now spare, Pass one short year, and ye are not! A little year shall send you where You'll perish among things forgot; Yet so, how envied should you be! For who is he would not prefer Before an immortality, To live a year, a day with Her? I fear she'll turn ye all to jest: Then let her know I've made my prayer, That, when by beaux, smart beaux, carest, She ne'er may feel a tender care! But while they sigh, or kneel, or vow, Think it all done in sport and play; Or write love-rhymes (as I do now), Laugh, but not trust a word they say. TO A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN, WITH THOMSON'S SEASONS, DOUBLED DOWN AT THE STORY OF PALEMON AND LAVINIA. Anna, when you shall read in this true tale How young Lavinia from her lowly state Was led to splendor, wealth, and dignity, By generous Palemon wooed and won To be his bride, (such happy fortune found Her virtues, and deserved no less)—so think Your beauty, temper'd with sweet bashful grace Of modesty and native elegance, So think these charms—not sparingly bestow'd But in the pride and prodigality Of liberal Nature, fashioning her work To a rare excellence,—these shall inflame Each generous heart with love, and the dear hope To win your gentle favour, and possess A lovelier Lavinia found in you. SONNET. [Ah! where is hid, if still it may survive] Ah! where is hid, if still it may survive The canker'd tooth of Age and Time's despight, Ah! where is hid that Orb of glass so bright, That Merlin for King Ryence did contrive; That wond'rous Orb so bright, wherein did live, Or ever Time had brought them into light, The forms of things unborn, which to the sight Its high-enchanted power would strangely give!— For Hope, with counterfeit of this true Glass, Doth so beguile the lover's easy mind, Still turning it to Fancy's idiot eye, That Reason's self forgets her majesty To join the gaze; till the fond phantoms pass, And Grief and stern Repentance rise behind. SONNET TO PETRARCH. O for that shell, whose melancholy sound, Heard in Valclusa by the lucid stream Of laurel-shaded Sorga, spread thy theme, Fair Laura and her scorn, to all around High-built Avignon, on the rocky mound That banks the impetuous Rhone, and like a steam From some rich incense rising, to the extreme Of desolate Hesperia did rebound, And gently waked the Muses:—so might I, Studious of song like thee, and ah! too like In sad complaint of ill-requited love, So might I, hopeless now, have power to strike Such notes, as lovers' tears should sanctify, And cold Fidele's melting sighs approve. TO A LADY, WHO DESIRED SOME SPECIMENS OF THE AUTHOR'S POETRY. Let not Eliza bid me now rehearse The unvalued rhymes that long forgotten lie: For all unfit is my rude-fashioned Verse To meet the censure of her curious eye: But for her sake a subject could I choose To draw down fame and envy on the Bard, Thy lovely Self should be my theme and Muse, And thy sweet smile, Eliza, my reward. EPITAPH ON A CHILD WHO DIED OF A SCARLET FEVER IN THE FIFTEENTH MONTH OF HIS AGE. 1802. Though thou wert dear, for lovely was thy form, And fair thy mind, and hopeful from thy birth; Though sudden was the pestilential storm That beat thy tender blossom to the earth; For thee we grieve not; certain that the soul Yet sinless, bursting from its earthy clod, Is borne on angel wings beyond the pole, Where infant innocence hath place with God. EPITAPH ON SIR CHARLES TURNER, BART. IN THE FAMILY MAUSOLEUM AT KIRK LEATHAM, YORKSHIRE. Beneath this hallow'd vault, this awful shade, Amidst his generous Forefathers laid, Lo Turner sleeps, the latest of his race, In prime of manhood given to Death's embrace. Heir of their name, and of their virtues heir, His heart was liberal, courteous, brave, sincere. Nor that his only praise; his patient mind, Cheerful in grief, in agony resign'd, Long bore the tedious hours of cureless pain, Which Love and Friendship strove to soothe in vain. Farewell, dear Consort of my happier days! To Thee this duty thy Theresa pays, Lamenting still for Thee, 'till fate shall join Her kindred spirit and her dust with thine. LINES WRITTEN AT THE TOMB OF WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM, IN WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL. Wykeham, around thy venerable tomb With fond affection still thy children come; And tho' no more the loud-voiced hymn they sing, Still silent prayers and heartfelt wishes bring, That thy departed Spirit, secure and blest, May with the destined heirs of glory rest; And, for thy pious bounty here bestow'd, Treasure in Heaven may have, and joy in God! TRANSLATION OF A GREEK INSCRIPTION UPON A FOUNTAIN There was a fountain in Arcadia, which had the reputation of creating an aversion to wine in whoever happened to bathe in it, although the water was innocent and wholesome to drink: and the tradition was, that it had received this singular property from Melampus, a celebrated physician of antiquity, when he made use of it to cure certain Arcadian princesses, the daughters of Prœtus, of a strange species of madness. These young ladies fancied themselves to be changed into cows. The story is frequently alluded to by the poets; both Ovid and Virgil mention it.. ?????? ??? ????????, ?. ?. ?. Vitruvius, Lib. 8. c. 3. Shepherd, if thirst oppress thee, while thy flock Thou lead'st at noon by this Arcadian spring, Here freely drink thy fill, and freely bring Around my Naïads all thy fleecy stock: But in the water wash not, lest thou feel Loathing, and strange antipathy to wine; Such power it hath to make thee hate the vine, E'er since my fount did Prœtus' daughters heal;— For here Melampus bathed them, here he cast A spell to purge their madness off, and hold The secret taint; what time from Argos old To rough Arcadia's mountain heights he past. FROM LUCRETIUS. ?sæpius olim Religio peperit scelerosa. —Lib. I. v. 83. Yet Superstition has of old brought forth More impious wickedness; witness that time In Aulis, when at Dian's temple met Th' associate Princes, Chiefs, the prime of Greece, And stain'd her altar with the virgin blood Of Iphigenia: o'er her youthful locks They bound the fillets; on her cheeks she felt The dress of sacrifice: but when she saw Beside the altar her dear father stand In sorrow, and for his sake the ministers Hiding their knife, and all the assembly round Weeping at sight of her; when this she saw, Struck mute with terror, on her knees she sunk. Ah! then in vain she called upon her king, Her father, urged him by a parent's love To save his wretched child; while ruthless hands Bore her all trembling to the altar's base; Not for her nuptials, not for holy rites Of Hymen, tended on with dance and song; But for a foul and bloody sacrifice. So fell this chaste and tearful victim, slain Ev'n in her marriage hour; and all to free Their wind-bound Navy from the fancied let Of adverse Deities, to such a guilt Could Superstition prompt a father's heart. FROM LUCRETIUS. Suave, mari magno turbantibus. —Lib. II. v. l. Sweet is it, when the stormy winds have roused The boisterous ocean, from on shore to view The toiling mariner; not that the pain Of others gives us pleasure, but for that To see what ills we 'scape ourselves is sweet: And it is sweet, when armies on the plain Array'd for battle join in mortal strife, To stand aloof from danger and look on: But nothing sweeter is, than all serene In the strong towers of wisdom high to dwell, And thence look down upon the wandering race Of men, that vainly seek the path of life; Vying in genius, or nobility; With unabated labour, night and day Striving to rise supreme in wealth or power. FROM LUCRETIUS. Avia Pieridum peragro loca. —Lib. IV. v. 1. Pierian heights, the Muses' trackless haunts And wilds untrodden erst by mortal feet, O'er these I wander, haply there to find New flowers and fountains new; I love to drink Of the pure stream fresh-welling, and to cull A wreath of orient hues and odours rare, Whence never poet yet his chaplet wove. PSALM LXXII. ABRIDGED, AND ADAPTED By adapted, is here meant, partly, that the accented syllables in the verse coincide with the accented notes of the tune. TO A PARTICULAR TUNE. Lord, to the King thy judgments give, Give to his Son thy righteousness: So shall thy people safely live, So he thy chosen flock shall bless. Great his dominion, large his sway O'er earth and ocean shall extend: Him shall remotest isles obey, Him the wide sea from end to end. War and the battle then shall cease, Then righteous men in favour stand; Peace shall return, a lasting peace; Plenty again shall store the land. While He, with choicest blessings crown'd, Long on his throne shall sit sublime; Honour'd by all the nations round, Honour'd by Kings of every clime. Blest be our God for these fair days, These happy days that rise again! O may his glorious name and praise Fill all the earth! Amen, amen. MIDNIGHT DEVOTION. WRITTEN IN THE GREAT STORM, 1822. When the storm's increasing roar, In the fearful hour of night, And the blast that rives my door Start the sleepers with affright; While the fierce descending rain And the warring winds of heaven All embattled rush amain On my fragile window driven; I, for those who bide this pelting, Breathe a prayer of charity, And, my soul with pity melting, Heavenly Father, call on Thee. SILBURY HILL Silbury Hill is a Barrow of the largest size. It stands close by the road from London to Bath: 80 miles west from Hyde-Park Corner.. O Thou, to whom in the olden time was raised Yon ample Mound, not fashion'd to display An artful structure, but with better skill Piled massive, to endure through many an age, How simple, how majestic is thy tomb! When temples and when palaces shall fall, And mighty cities moulder into dust, When to their deep foundations Time shall shake The strong-based pyramids, shall thine remain Amid the general ruin unsubdued, Uninjured as the everlasting hills, And mock the feeble power of storms and Time. TO THE DAISY. Gentle flower, young April's pride, Say not Nature hath denied Thee her bounty or her grace, Though thou lack the Rose's face. Where she spreads her carpet green There thy maiden form is seen, Drest in robes of purest white, Ever constant in her sight, But at will to wanton wild, Like a playful darling child. Thee she tends in summer days, And the nibbling ewes that graze Spare to crop her favourite: And the Fairies, when by night Their green paths they quaintly tread, Walk not o'er thy sleeping head. FRAGMENT. King Richard in the gray Tower sate, Captive of Austria's haughty Lord, In a strange land, unhonour'd, unexplored, To felon durance changed his royal state. Pale was his haggard eye, And sunk his cheek, to stern captivity In all—all but in his Lion heart subdued: He sate in melancholy solitude, And sadly gazed upon the setting sun, As down the heavenly road, That all with purple glow'd, It wested toward his realm of Albion. FROM PURCHASE'S PILGRIMAGE, VERSIFIED AND DESIGNED AS A MOTTO TO “VOYAGES FOR THE DISCOVERY OF A N. W. PASSAGE.” How shall I admire Your courage, ye marine Adventurers? Worthies, beyond all names of worthiness! Who can endure alike the Sun so long Present or absent; and without a dread Encounter foggy mist, tempestuous sleet, Cold blasts, with snows and hail in th' frozen air, And those unequal seas which might amaze All ears and eyes, yea, and make Neptune's self To quake with chilly fear when he beholds: When his huge Monsters, Icy Isles, disdaining His sovereignty, and the Sun's hot violence, Muster upon those watery plains, for war, Continual war; and wheresoe'er they rush Make winds and waves give back, till, in the shock, Crashing and rending their congealed sides, They split themselves with their own massiness. FRAGMENT. But who is He shall put his daring hand To Love's mysterious Harp, and with rude touch Discordant violate the silver string Whose note is sweeter than the balmy South Impregn'd with soft Æolian harmony! The Song of Love is like an Angel's voice Attuned to heavenly music; and once heard On this Terrestrial; when the Bard of Thrace Bewail'd his lost Euridice, it drew The wild Inhabitants to hear his Lyre;— Yea savage Beasts and Things inanimate To listen to his dulcet melody:— Such power is in the magic sounds of Love. THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE. O for the thousand flowers that erst did bloom In that Sicilian Valley wild, Where golden Ceres left her Child Conceal'd from all the Sons of Jove, So to elude th' inevitable doom Of Fate, and stronger Love! In vain.—The grisly Monarch of the Dead, Stern Dis, uprears his gloomy head Mid the black smoke and ruddy flames that wrap Around old Ætna's smould'ring top; There, as the wandering Nymph he view'd, Awhile in blank amaze he stood Till Love to fury roused his blood. He call'd his ebon Car and Steeds of fire: They came, and with the headlong torrent's speed Down to the lily-spangled mead They bore their mighty Sire: Swift in his arms the fainting Maid he took, Then drove impetuous on, while all Sicilia shook. SONNET. [O thou, to whom my heart (no longer mine)] O thou, to whom my heart (no longer mine) Doth yield itself a captive love-subdued; Fair goodly frame of Nature's work divine To inchase the gem thy mind more fair and good, Let not thy scorn pursue the Muse's Son, For gentle is his mind, and pure his flame, And for thy love he shall inscribe thy name Among those Fair whose peerless beauty won Renown from ancient bards, on harp and lyre So sweetly sounded, that the wondering Earth, Thro' all her climes, yet listens to the strain. O meekly-blooming Flower, if on thy birth Soft Pity shed her dew, quench not his fire, Quench not his hallow'd fire with cold disdain. SONG. [When Phœbus, for what crime unknown] When Phœbus, for what crime unknown, Was exiled from the Courts of Jove, And to this earth came mournful down, Of all things else bereft, but love; (For that pure Fire feels not the storms That shake or change this worldly frame; Immortal as the soul it warms, It burns in unextinguish'd flame—) His fingers to the lyre he turn'd, Then all with chords of sorrow strung; The lost delights of heaven he mourn'd, But more her loss, for whom he sung: He sung so sweetly that the strain Drew pity from the gods above; They call'd the wanderer back again, And gave the Muse to crown his love. SONG. [To thy cliffs, rocky Seaton, adieu!] To thy cliffs, rocky Seaton, adieu! And adieu to the roar of thy seas! And adieu to the Girl, whose insensible heart Is as hard and as sullen as these! Forget the fond echoes you heard! Forget my fond hope and my strain! My strain is neglected and dead is my hope:— But you never shall hear me complain— To thy cliffs, rocky Seaton, adieu! SONG. [Gentle Stream, whose wild meanders] Gentle Stream, whose wild meanders Cheer the birds and feed the flowers, While by thee Amelia wanders, Wilt thou soothe her pensive hours? If the world were at my bidding, Music should her steps attend, And where'er her feet were treading, Flowers should bloom, and sweets ascend. SONG. TO A LADY GOING TO HER FAMILY IN IRELAND. Will you go, Mary, from me? Is it choice, or love or duty, That you trust your worth and beauty Upon the stormy Sea? Can you hope, Mary, to find, Tho' you rove the wide world over, Friends so true, so fond a Lover, As you leave here behind? TO THE SUN. O Thou whose inextinguishable eye Now sleeps beneath the ocean stream, Whether the star of morn shall call thee forth To pour thy rich and fiery beam Through the wide arch of an unclouded sky; Or whether the rude North Shall o'er thy head his showery mantle cast, Making the dank earth shiver at his blast; Welcome alike to me! the genial day That gave my fair Eliza birth Needs not thy gaudy smile to make it glad: Still cheer the spleeny race of earth With the warm lustre of thy fostering ray; On me in vain are shed Thy beams and unregarded, while I prove The dearer influence of Her smiles and love. SONG. [Artless words of unfeign'd passion] Artless words of unfeign'd passion With harmonious numbers join'd, Soothly try your soft persuasion On Eliza's gentle mind! For her ear alone intended, Other censure nought regard: If by her you are commended, 'Tis enough for your reward. But why thus you seek to move her Strive not further to explain!— If her heart will not discover, You or I should tell in vain. TO A LADY, FORTUNE-TELLING WITH CARDS. Dear Nancy, if you wish to know What Fate reserves in store for you, Ask not the idle cards to show,— I'll tell as wisely, and as true. For I will take a magic Book Of characters divinely fair; Upon thy lovely Self I'll look, And read, dear Girl, thy fortune there. By those love-darting Eyes I find How many hearts their empire own; I see the sweetness of thy mind That keeps the hearts those eyes have won. Yet none among so many hearts, Nor any you shall yet subdue, Should you join all their better parts, Can make a heart to merit you. Now, shall I look into your breast And see what Heart is favour'd there?— No,—be that fatal Truth suppress'd, Lest I should sink in my despair! EPIGRAM. From two domestic acts of pious zeal Learn what calamities sad mortals feel. When Lord George Gordon of the Pope afeard, (That was before he show'd a Jewish beard) When he his Whiggish Mob had raised, they fly On poor Lord Mansfield's harmless Library. Then were his legal Writings, precious store, Burnt, or dispersed as Sibyl's leaves of yore. Twelve years elapsed from that disastrous tide, And lo! another storm from t'other side! In vengeance on their Presbyterian foes The loyal Mob of Birmingham arose; And as their zeal for Church and King grew hot, All Priestley's books and papers went to pot. Losses like these till then we never saw; Priestley's Divinity and Mansfield's Law. ON TWO ENGLISH POETS, WHO FLOURISHED IN THE FORMER HALF OF THE LAST CENTURY, AND PUBLISHED COMPLIMENTARY VERSES ON EACH OTHER. Edward, thy Ode's too long by half, Stephen's Reply might spare a quarter: Now, in my judgment, Stephen's song Is as much better, as 'tis shorter. Edward declares, though Milton's lines Rise to an unexampled height, That, in heroics, Stephen shines Like Milton, and almost as bright. Stephen for quittance makes reply, That nothing in the world could hinder (Except his native modesty) Edward from taking place of Pindar. Stephen and Edward all this while Are lying to each other's face; Edward can do 't in bolder style, But Stephen with a better grace. VERSES TO THE HONOUR OF THE LONDON PASTRYCOOK, WHO MARKED “NO POPERY” ON HIS PIES, &amp;c. I'll sing the praise of Mr. B?, Whose Pastry, watchful for the Church, Whene'er it sees, or fears, a Plot, Starts from his counter, piping hot, To warn us of the dire intent, And, like himself, is eloquent. Pale Biscuits and stout Gingerbread Th' alarm of danger widely spread; Then quaking Custards join the cry, And Tartlets squeak, “No Popery!” Defender of the Faith! rare Cook, Who mak'st thy Pastry-shop a Book As formidable, and much more read Than that which our eighth Henry made, Whose Church-of-England oven bakes Protestant Appletarts and Cakes! Children that feed upon thy Pies Grow in religion as in size; While, often as their mouths they ope, They chew destruction to the Pope. Fame shall desert th'ingenious Quaker To celebrate our Cross-bun Baker; Whose willing Pupils, apter far Than all the school of Lancaster, Shall read, and eat, his name enroll'd On Cakes of Gingerbread in gold. ON THE FUNERAL OF ?, IN A HEARSE AND SIX, FOLLOWED BY A MOURNING COACH AND FOUR. What, Save-all in a Hearse convey'd! And six brave Nags to draw the Dead! 'Tis ruin!—Why, 'tis more by five Than e'er convey'd him while alive. And look, what follows!—more and more Profusion, in a Coach and Four! Such waste of what thou liv'dst to save, Might break the quiet of thy Grave. In what slow pomp the Rogues advance, Courting, as 'twere, Extravagance! O! the vast charge of every night! They revel, and set nothing by 't; But give to have thee lie in state, More than thou e'er paid'st there for meat. What else?—their dead and useless load They carry on the Turnpike road, Paying—but they care nothing, they, How many Gates there be to pay.— Plague on the Gates! how thick they are! Five pounds will soon be squander'd here. Another—and another yet! And Half-a-crown at every Gate; Those Gates which thou didst alway shun, To save thy Pence from every one. Alas! this needless cost is more Than all th' extravagance before! To stop such charge, at least, arise And show them—where the Bye-way lies! PARODY ON DRYDEN'S “THREE POETS,” &amp;c. Three Poets, born in different lands and ages, Three different Heroes took to grace their pages: The first, a Buonaparte, fierce to fight; The next, a Methodistic Hypocrite: No human character combined more evil, So Milton for his Hero took the Devil. EPIGRAM. When first the Devil came in Milton's view A swindging Tail ? th' old Dragon— ? wroth to see his kingdom fail, Swindges the scaly horror of his folded tail. Ode on the Nativity. upon his rump there grew: But when in Pandæmomium he appears How alter'd is his form! no tail he wears. Such difference in that Personage is seen As Milton by himself perceived, between His full-grown Epic and his stripling Ode— His tadpole Devil had become a Toad. AN EXPOSTULATORY SUPPLICATION TO DEATH, AFTER THE DECEASE OF DR. BURNEY. Thou Trojan Death! thou worse than Trojan foe To English Greeks, the best of Greeks we know! In three we boasted; three we had of late, Rare Burney, matchless Porson, and the great ??? ?????, props and pillars of our state; Two thou hast ravish'd from us; and the land Watches in anxious fear thy threat'ning hand. Two thou hast ravish'd, but we can't resign a ??? ????? yet awhile,—O spare ??? ?????. ON THE DECEASE OF HORNE TOOKE. Horne Tooke is gone—rejoice and sing, Ye Placemen, and ye Tools of a King! He is gone!—then be his faults forgiven, And let us hope he's gone to Heaven. That is a prayer you ought to make If not for love, for interest' sake; For should he go to t'other place, Think how he 'll plague your hireling race. INSCRIPTION FOR THE GRANITE SARCOPHAGUS BROUGHT FROM ALEXANDRIA TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM. This was the tomb of Alexander, The Macedonian great Commander, Who dealt about his killing blows Alike among his friends and foes: Who went on plundering, burning, stabbing, Carouzing, catamiting, drabbing, Kept a Castrato Q.

Alexander took the cup, and pulled nobly at it. Mem. It held near a gallon, and he had emptied it once already. heroically drunk: And if at last he went to hell, I warrant he deserved it well; Whate'er is said by flatt'ring Mitford, Who thinks he is gone to heav'n, and fit for't. INSCRIPTION FOR A STATUE OF FIELD-MARSHAL SUWOROW. This was a Warrior of renown, A Hero bred, and born to kill; Who scrupled not to shed his own It is related of him, that in his march to the attack of Oczakow, he proceeded with such rapidity at the head of his men, that they began to murmur at the fatigues which they endured. The marshal, apprised of the circumstance, after a long day's march, drew up his men in a hollow square, and addressing them said, that “his legs had that day discovered some symptoms of mutiny, as they refused to second the impulses of his mind, which urged him forward to the attack of the enemy's fortress.” He then ordered his boots to be taken off, and some of the drummers to advance and flog his legs, which was done till they bled very considerably. He then put on his boots very coolly, expressing his hope that his legs would in future better know how to discharge their duty. His army afterwards marched on without a murmur., When he lack'd other blood to spill. And often would he turn his arms On those within his bosom bred, And quell by fire the mighty swarms Suworow affectoit beaucoup de simplicité et de rudesse. On le voyoit quelquefois ôter sa chemise au milieu des Cosaques, et la fain chauffer, en disant que c'etoit pour tuer ses poux. Vie de Catherine II. tome ii. p. 373. That with his life-blood he had fed. His person, cover'd o'er with glory, In truth was little clean or nice; And 'tis a question in his story, Whether he kill'd more men The number of men slaughtered by this hero was at the rate of more than thirty a week, reckoning from the day of his birth to the age of 69 years, according to the account given in the history of his campaigns, by Frederic Anthing. or lice. ON FIELD-MARSHAL SUWOROW. A DIALOGUE. A. This Hero, though delighting much in blood, Was yet a tender-hearted creature.— B. Good. A. Without remorse he slaughter'd Turk and Pole, But still his nerves were very weak.— B. Poor soul! A. And he became a prey to grief, for why, His master frown'd upon him.— B. O fie! fie! A. Unkindness did his gentle heartstrings crack, And so the Hero came to an end.— B. Good lack! A. That one so valiant and so meek, is't fit he Should go at last to the devil?— B. What a pity! ON F. W. THE KING OF PRUSSIA'S INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT ON WARSAW. When Frederic, when the Usurper turn'd With baffled arms and insolence abash'd, From fearless Warsaw's radiant walls, (For, crested with the Sons of Liberty, Then stood they fearless and secure,) No less than was that mount in Israel once, Where Angels rode in fiery guard Around the Prophet “And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an Host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? And he answered, fear not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.” —2 Kings, ch. vi. v. 15, &amp;c.. Ever such defence Be made for freedom, and usurpers Abated and confounded in their pride, As Frederic now! He, when he turn'd, Thus gave mad utterance to his spleeny mood:— This royal merchandise of war That wont to bring towns, cities, provinces, To kings for profit, is become A losing trade, or only serves to enrich My shrewder neighbours, they who fight In quarrels not their own, and wisely sell The lives, unprofitable else, Of their obedient multitude: but I, Cursed be the hour I did so, I Who had the wealthiest of the world my dupe, England, to pay me lavish hire For service ne'er peform'd, must needs, O fool! To this most perilous venture run On mine own credit: therefore am I made A very bankrupt; all my hopes Of victory, dominion, fortune, fame, All ruin'd, and my royal word, My promises and threats alike held vile As the vain Brunswick's menaces, Horrible once, now laugh'd at and despised. For who now fears me, or believes?— But let me from this ruinous assault, With what is left me, safe retire, And I will yet regain the credulous ear Of Her, whose unexhausted wealth Exceeds all measure but her easy faith, Good England:—O that I were now In England, with my royal Brother there, Giving a false alarm in jest To Weymouth town, and Buckinghamshire Captains About the commencement of the war in 1793, the late king used to visit Weymouth for some weeks of the summer, when the Buckinghamshire militia attended his majesty as a guard of honour. It was during one of these visits that this military occurrence is reported to have taken place.. POLITICAL ADVICE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH CONVENTION. A DIALOGUE. “Messieurs of the Convention, Gentlemen! “Hav'n't ye rebell'd against your sovereign?”—“Stuff.” “Deposed him?”—“Nonsense.” “Murder'd him?”—“What then?” “Usurp'd his place and kingdom?”—“Like enough!” “Hav'n't ye bullied Princes far and near, “Encroach'd upon your neighbours, 'gainst all Law? “Without Religion, Honour, Faith, or Fear, “Sworn and forsworn yourselves?”—“O, ça ira.” “Nay, Gentlemen, I speak not to upbraid: “Rather, I'd say, you seem to need a spur: “Hav'n't ye still some object of your dread, “Some innocent young Prince, your prisoner? “Poison him—stab him—put him out o'th' way— “Is that so monstrous?—Nay, you have a pattern: “Do as I bid you, then stand up, and say, “We are now upon a par with Royal Kattern.” WRITTEN WHEN BUONAPARTE WAS ALTERING THE GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANY. The Madman thought that he did climb Over the wall which bounds the universe; And there he saw how father Time Out of old Moons was busy cutting Stars. Thus o'er our globe Napoleon, As if old Time had lent him scythe and wings, Speeds and destroys, and for his fun From waning Emperors cuts out little Kings. SUGGESTED BY READING DRYDEN'S BRITANNIA REDIVIVA, A Poem on the Prince, born on the 10th of June, 1688. When James the Second took his second spouse, The royal couple (as their Church allows) T' obtain a son and heir devoutly pray'd, And call'd on many a popish saint for aid; By costly gifts and vows they sued to gain Th' inestimable boon, nor sued in vain: A son was given; and as the story ran, Their saints convey'd the blessing in a warming-pan. And now th' expected babe, howe'er it came, Was theirs; but living yet without a name. Why to this Child of prayer, this boon of Heaven, A name appropriate was not sooner given; What moved the royal sire to make delay, In such a case, 'tis difficult to say. Dryden suggests—go, read him if you doubt it, There was some brawl among the Saints about it. Good gracious folks, they could not yet agree; Each eager that the name his own should be: He thinks some wanted—but I dare not, I, Repeat what follows of the irreverend lie. Yet since I have curtail'd that Flatterer's fable, I'll piece it with another as I am able, And tell you the result of this celestial squabble. There stood an ancient One among the herd, Who took no part, nor utter'd yet a word; He seem'd not much acquainted with the rest; His port was manly, simple was his vest, And veil'd his head: but now he silence broke, And thus in slow and sober tones he spoke. “The Babe, your present care, shall have a name That all his life will follow him with shame. Both He, and whomsoe'er he shall engender, Will be deem'd spurious, and be call'd Pretender.” His words the saintly synod fill'd with rage, Nor felt they reverence for his rank or age; But with ungovernable fury big, Call'd him Apostate, Protestant, and Whig. Calm and composed, their cries awhile he bore, Nor deign'd to make defence, nor utter'd more, But, casting off his veil, naked he stood, And Truth's resplendent form abash'd they view'd. SUCCESSION. After a bad oft comes a worse; Evil on evil, curse on curse: So James to Charles succeeds, who fitter? Of a French Popish mother's litter This was the next and favourite whelp; He with Judge Jefferies's help, A fell-fang'd lurcher, hot for blood, The gallant Algernon pursued; Hamper'd him basely in a Coop, Then ran him down, and cried whoo-whoop! But though so fierce to treat this man ill, His Jesuits used him like a spaniel; Rated him soundly, or carest, As served their ends and purpose best, Which not long after to his cost He felt, his crown and kingdom lost. Ev'n then these Masters gave not o'er, But taught him lessons as before; How he might render Heaven his debtor, And earn another crown and better: Told him, 'twas highly meritorious To exalt the Pope, and kill old Glorious: That what he did t'avenge his Father, He might do for himself, and rather. So with his Priests and his Assassins, By machinations, plots, compassings, He struggled long against hard odds To advance the Devil's cause and God's. Hopeless at last, his means all spent, He died a Murderer and a Saint. EPIGRAM. Ille Crucem sceleris pretium tulit, Hic Diadema. Good people of England, 'tis fit you should note What you get, or may suffer, for bribing a vote; And for an example we'll bring to your view An Irish Lord and a Baronet Jew; The Jew and my Lord in a similar case— One pays a great fine, t' other holds a great place: My Lord is bedeck'd with a Ribbon and Garter, The Jew is in Jail for two years, lack a quarter. And now we'll compare, if you please to allow us, The Jew in his Jail, with my Lord in the House: The Jew is surrounded by Felons and Debtors, And my Lord by some folks who are little their betters. ON THE INCREASE OF HUMAN LIFE. Fate deals out human life by seven-year spaces: Time was you would be thought in her good graces With nine of these; when David lived 'twas ten; If more She gave, 'twas only now and then, A few cold years of winter, and the last, Tho' charged with toil and sorrow, quickly past. But in our age more bounteous Fate appears, And often grants a dozen-fold seven years; Nay, be but still and temperate like the Quakers, Perhaps she'll make your dozen up a baker's. ODE TO THE KING OF FRANCE. 1823. What moves thee, Louis, to forego The quiet of thy peaceful reign? Why challenge a reluctant foe, Rushing to war, war unprovoked, again? Examine well thine own estate, And check thy hostile march before it be too late. When first thou wert an exile from thy home, Unbroken was thy strength, thy health not wasted; But couldst thou now endure to roam, When both thy health and strength thou hast outlasted? With peace and plenty to thy throne restored, Perchance thou deem'st thyself adored: Thou seest around thee subjects bending low; But should misfortune now return, Be sure thou soon shalt know Thyself their hate, and all thy race their scorn. Where are thy men-at-arms, they, once who moved So lively at the warlike trumpet's call? And where their chiefs, thy mareschals all, Heroes in many a glorious battle proved?— In stern repose each warrior lies. As flowers that all the darksome night Close themselves up, until the day-star rise, Then ope, and turn, as worshipping his light: So these, in sullen slumber now reclined, May soon awake, when thou shalt find Their worship and their service turn'd and gone, Toward their own day-star, the young Napoleon. And darest thou, presumptuous, now demand That Heaven shall speed thy mad career To spoil an unoffending land? And darest thou hope that Heaven will hear? Believe it not:—but for thyself beware; And learn to moderate thy prayer: Pray that kind Heaven will condescend To grant thee rest and safety till thine end; And for the consummation of thy lot, That old St. Denys will allow thee room To sleep uncensured and forgot, Among thy fathers in a silent tomb. VERSES SPOKEN IN THE THEATRE, OXFORD, AT THE INSTALLATION OF THE CHANCELLOR, LORD GRENVILLE, JULY 10, 1810, BY HENRY CROWE, A COMMONER OF WADHAM COLLEGE. Still through the realms of Europe far around Echoes the martial trump, the Battle's sound: There many a nation, now subdued and broke, In sullen silence wears the Tyrant's yoke: There the fierce Victor waves his sword, and there Stalks amid ruin, and the waste of war: And, where he bids the din of arms to cease, He calls the silent desolation—peace. Yet what his prize of glory? What the gain Of his wide conquest, of his thousands slain?— His guilty seat on thrones subverted stands; His trophies are the spoil of injured lands: For his dark brow no comely wreath is twined, But iron The iron crown of Italy. crowns and blood-stain'd laurels bind. Far other objects here around us rise, The monuments of nobler victories. This splendid dome, yon goodly piles behold, This favour'd ground adorning, which of old Our first great Chief, a patriot Hero, chose “For Learning's triumph o'er her barbarous foes Johnson's Prologue, spoken at the opening of Drury-Lane, 1747.:” These are her honourable trophies; here No spoils of plunder'd provinces appear. Our hallow'd fanes, our lofty spires, were built By pure and bounteous hands unsoil'd with guilt. Pure also was the source: the bounty springs From holy Prelates, from religious Kings; Who in the peaceful walks of life pursued Their godlike occupation, doing good; And taught us, careless of a transient fame, Like them to seek a worthier meed, and claim Th' immortal recompense that Heaven decrees For charitable toils, and generous works of peace. Is there, who nurtured in this happy seat, Still loves the Mansion, Learning's choice retreat?— Who yet these groves will honour, where his youth Was early train'd to Virtue and to Truth;— Who liberal arts and useful Science wooes, And by the Muse beloved, protects the Muse; Whose patient labour and unabated zeal Pursues that nobles tend, his Country's Weal;— Watchful, and resolute in her defence With counsel sage, and manly eloquence?— For Him fair Fame her clearest voice shall raise Till her high trumpet labours in his praise. He 'bove the Conqueror's name shall be renown'd, Him Glory still shall follow, and around Laurels unstain'd, unfading palms, shall spread, Such as are now prepared for Grenville's honour'd head.</field>
