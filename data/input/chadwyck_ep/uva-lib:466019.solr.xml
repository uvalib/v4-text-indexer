      <field name="fulltext">TRISTRAM AND ISEULT. AN EPISODE. So by the ever-rolling Cornish waves That eat the granite into countless caves They sat and pondered o'er their troublous past From that bright morn when first their vessel's mast Bent to the breeze that swept the Irish shore; The day when Tristram young and happy bore Iseult as young and happy to be bride To Marc who ruled the Cornish foam beside: The purple heather and the golden furze Stretched far before them, and the sun shone high In heaven; one spake, the silver voice was hers,â She broke the silence, nestling yet more nigh. âO Tristram, soul of mine, what have we gained? What flower of beauty have our hands retained? The sun in heaven is sweet and high to-day, The furze is golden 'mid these boulders grey Of monstrous scattered granite; lo! the heather, One sheet of purple in the glad clear weather, Stretches towards the palace of King Marc, Above whose towers the sky's one cloud hangs dark; But we,âwhat have we gained for all our sin? Where are the roses that we thought to win? Where are the lilies of untamed delight That thou didst promise for a circlet bright Which Iseult's buoyant throbbing brow should wear:â My soul is burthened by this summer air. My soul is wearied by these labouring seas; My spirit is sickened by this perfumed breeze; My heart is straitened 'mid this boundless sky; Would God that we were dead: yea, thou and I. What, what will be the end? I long for flowers That fade not at the touch of earth's cold showers; Thy kisses are not sweet, as once each kiss Seemed the chief rose of heaven's most utter bliss. I am aweary: almost I could pity King Marc: would that in some unknown fair city I might pass days of labour till my death:ââ But Tristram answered, catching eager breath: âSpeak not so, lady: think of all delights We two have known together; summer nights When here in Cornwall every rose seemed part Of one wide-beating joyous amorous heart And that heart ours: rememberest thou how first After love's draught awoke our endless thirst Our close lips clung, and how we swore to be Twin fair linked spirits of love eternally, Living not far apartânay living near, Each spirit to each in purest union dear, Too great for sinning,âan example high Of how true love once wakened, cannot die, Nor yet will suffer lovers to obscure White hearts, white hands, by passionate act impure. Oh mindest thou the great old vows we swore Ere, all too swift, our vessel touched the shore Of Cornwall: how we twain would help the king My uncle, yet with joy of passion sing,â With joy of secret passion nursed between Thy bosom white and this strong breast, O Queen! Rememberest thou, Iseult? Rememberest thou How Marc my uncle when the glittering prow Of our love's vessel touched his Cornish strand Came forth and took thee trembling by the hand, And how across the skies before so blue A sudden wintriest gust, fast-darkening, blew? Rememberest thou how for a time endured Our vows, and passion lingered unobscured, High, spotless, dauntless,âwhite as the white flag Of our fair ship, or yonder gleaming crag: Sweet, sweet it seemed to stand while others fell; Sweet all high thoughts and high desires to tell Each to the other; dreams of knighthood high, Of splendid prowess, fame that should not die. Yea, ever as I think King Marc bestowed With open eyes and evil heart that glowed Like hell's own fire withinâah, Satan's glance Of his!âupon our passion every chance. He hated thee, mine Iseult; and his hate Flung for our fall wide open every gate, Hurled for our sin from the hinges every door: The gentler, softer thou,âhe lusted more. And lo! his lust took on this evil form, Thee, sweet, to hurl adown black sorrow's storm Like a white bird that struggles 'gainst the blast; This he would do! into such action passed His hate: he put temptation, honey-lipped, Upon thy path,âthen smote the mouth that sipped. Then smote the mouth! ah Iseult, one fell day, Dost thou remember? when the sky was grey With clouds and storm, and when the hard-pressed foam Curling flew landwards, whirling o'er thine home,â Dost thou remember meeting me in tears, Fresh from Marc's savage temper, fresh from sneers And gibes of cutting tongue:âthy neck of snow Red from thine husband's hand,âhot from a blow? âDost thou remember? That blow sealed our fate: His hand flung open then the one last gate. âThen came a time of dreams: of sweet desire, Far sweeter than of old: of nights of fire, Days of fierce sun, evenings when heaven seemed close; For then, the first time, blossomed our full rose. Then the first time we knew what passion meant; The maiden veil that hid desire was rent, The sweet robe sundered,âand thy body of flame Was as white fire indeed, no more a name, A lovely whispered mystery unseen, But mine, not Marc's,âand mine for aye, my Queen. The night, the night: summer it was, and Marc Away: our passion lighted all the dark As with gold countless stars, and the sweet smell Of all thine hair caressed me,âas it fell In one dark amorous encircling flood About me, loosed from golden-bordered hood, And first our hands clutched eagerly, and then Swift-beating breast met tremulous bosom; when, Lastly, with rapture crowning every sense, Lips thrilled to lips in the divine intense Inevitable inseparable kiss. Iseult! Iseult! hast thou forgotten this? The same Iseultâever the sameâthou art, And I, I bear the same, same-bounding heart, That beats for ever with swift equal tides For thee: the fairest, sweetest of all brides That knights have won,âyea fairer unto me, Fairer and softer, lovelier, than is she Who crowneth Lancelot with her bosom's rose:â But these are thoughts of sorrow, sweet, of woes, Of troubles,âsad thou art; let me once more Wake with my harp the old echoes of the shore.â So Tristram took his gold-strung harp, and sang, And all the rocks and the far uplands rang To his sweet singing,âand Iseult the Queen Yearned to his voice and watched, the while serene Slow waves before them brake the sea's dull green. âThe old joys were not sweet as joy that finds us Now truly, sweetheart, thou and I are one: The moon of soft love sank; now passion blinds us With burning rays from its far fiercer sun, Crowning the miscalled evil we have done. âJoy is a gift that shall endure for ever; The sorrows are the swift-winged wraiths that fade: Death, all too weak, our spirits may not sever: Iseult, sweet Iseult, be not thou afraid; Love lends his strength and splendid wrath to aid. âYea Love is on our side: who reads our story In future years shall listen to the roll Of passion's white pure waves that drave their hoary Crests far beyond the force of feebler soul To follow,âtouching an immortal goal.â But Iseult's face darkened the while he sang, And upward to her feet at length she sprang And stretched out snowy hand; âGive me the harp,â She said, and bitter was her tone and sharp, Though tremulous too: âI likewise have a song That trembles through my soul in wave-beats strong; Lonely the other morn within my bower I made the song; thou know'st not Iseult's power!â And then she sang; with swift grey eyes that sought In his to mark the reflex of her thought, And swift white fingers; while her bosom heaved, As through the melody her spirit grieved. âSweet were the old joys,âsweet is passion, lover! Yet Iseult craves for pleasure deeper yet, Fain would she some undying joy discover; Upon some stormless rock her soft foot set, Beyond repentance, change, remorse, regret. âThe flowers that once were sweet are spent and bloomless; The songs that once we sang are silent now; The world were glad,âif but the world were tombless! This morning one grey hair above my brow Gleamed through the black loose locks,âbehold it, thou! âThat grey thread spake of silence and sun-setting; It spake of glory that shall be no more; I need a love past anguish, past regretting,â A love that breaks upon no deathly shore Wave-like, when love's first loveliness is o'er.â Now, while they sang, across the fair blue sky Clouds many and boding storm began to fly And the sweet sun was darkened, and the seas Were touched to white by the fast-wakening breeze; And so, a wind of sorrow o'er their souls Swept,âbright furze-blossoms over windy knolls Flew, eddied round them by the chillier blast, And with the change of scene their spirits fast Darkened and saddened likewise, till he spake: âIseult, thy strange sad song hath power to wake Within me memories buried; it derives Its strength from marvels of our mutual lives. But what now, sweet? Art thou so tired of love? Is this the first thing to grow weary of? Truly I love thee: yet if thou art tired, If change of love is by thine heart desired, Here am I, ready far away to roam, Beyond that utmost stretch of glittering foam,â Ready to seek new lands and newer loves, Where white arms shine 'mid perfumed orange-groves, And where the roses of the amorous South Match, vainly, tints with many a maiden's mouth. Yea, we are old in love, too old in joy; Pleasure began for us when I a boy, When thou a girl, beneath thy castle high In Ireland, watched the changes of the sky, Marking till eve from radiant dawn of day The blue sky severed by those turrets grey, As o'er the lawns or under shadier trees We wandered, threading trim-kept pleasances: Now we are old; thy mouth is far less red; The blast of winter wanders round thine head; A grey hair, saidest thou? I see them shine Upon that forehead where Love loved to twine The endless flawless rose! and now thine hands Are no more lilies, loveliest of all lands, Thy voice is harsh; Iseult, I will away Beyond the foam, beyond the breakers grey; Passion shall touch me with her touch of gold, And love as warm, as soft, as love of old, Shall circle me; God's pleasant world is wide:â Man's spirit is straitened by one arduous bride. The time hath come for change: yea, thou art tired! Nor more by me is thine embrace desired. Arms wait me far more gentle, and as white, And eyes fulfilled with even as tender light As thine eyes onceâbefore they changed to dark, Loving, I hold, at length thy noble Marc,â His value seen at last,âhis face, his voice, Longed for: Iseult, thou hast made a worthy choice With all the wisdom of a woman: Goâ Kiss Marc: uncover, love, thy breast of snow Before him: touch him tenderly: it may be His spirit shall yearn with late true love of thee, And thou shalt find late rapture at his side; At length a loved and ever-loving bride! Nay! weep not, sweetheart; tears are but pretence; Thy time for weeping is when far from hence I pass the faithless kisses from thy mouth To some red lips, far redder, in the South. Marc is sufficient; Tristram is a dream! A dream of girlish love! a fitting theme Is our love after all for maidens wan:â Now seek I passion worthy of a man. Women there are, women there are: thy song Has made my spirit rejoice; now am I strong, Knowing my strength of manhood,âweak art thou,â Go home to Marc, child-Iseult: bend and bow Low at his feet: it may be that to-night In soft arms he shall reap untold delight, If, haply, he comes home not wearied out By strange hot kisses, nor with drunken shout, As often with his followers came he home When their boats' lights, red-glimmering o'er white foam, Gave in the bygone days the signal fit To us i' the tower that love's lamp but just lit By us perhaps, must fall a broken torch: Then as we heard the splay feet in the porch Pollute the marble, the last clinging kiss, Our oneâthe bestâfor Marc that night to miss. â'Tis over: over: kisses are but poor; Thy song has said as much: they but endure For one short summer; then Love's birds forsake Their tree of the season and with laughter shake Wild plumes adown the breezeâ:âbut Iseult said, âPeace: hath not yet thine arrow quivering sped, Flown, reached its Marc? The seemly deed is done: Lo! o'er the Atlantic sets our once bright sun Befouled by clouds; I am not now a girl By whom thy harsh words like blown leaflets whirl, Unharming and untouchingâ:âThen she rose, Pointed to where the sea surged; âTristram goes,â She said, âto seek white arms across the foam; I go to seek mine husband in his home; I was mistaken; Tristram I had thought A perfect noble knight: his love I sought, His endless knightly aid: but he hath spurned Away the lonely spirit that craved and yearned; Go, seek thy soft caresses, and forget Me, Irish Iseult: we have never met.â But Tristram in his lover's anger turned; Nor once looked back at the wet eyes that yearned Towards him departing and the trembling hands: He strode across the far-stretched dimpling sands That yielded deep at each pain-stricken tread: Iseult stood upright; in white hand one red Small flower she crushed and soft the petals fell Like drops of blood: but when a darkling dell Had hidden Tristram as he turned inland She let the whole crushed flower fall from her hand Unheeding, and with hard grey eyes that burned Dry now and hot and fevered, unconcerned In outward show, passed murmuring a low tune Homeward. The sun had set, wan rose the moon. 1877. TO C. C. Nay! not a âpoppy,â but a wild white rose, Pure, sweet, and tender,âclinging to the stem Like a soft-hued and gracious diadem,â Fresh with the wind that o'er the North Sea blows. Rose-like the gentle spirit within thee grows And, though surrounding folk thy life contemn, Thou need'st not waver nor take heed of them, If thine own heart its clear vocation knows. Therefore, white Northern Rose, be not afraid: Thy mission is to gladden and to heal, And, if thy life's true task be long delayed And tangled boughs the rosebud's shape conceal, It is that more than that one Northern glade May in the end thy power and bounty feel. THE INCARNATION OF VENUS. O subtle form by the grey cliff-top standing, What art thou, sweet? Whence came that glance so swift and so commanding, That swift heart-beat? Art thou a woman, or diviner, prouder, More fierce, more fair, Made to be hymned by passionate harp-strings louder And lyres more rare? If women are most white, then art thou whiter? More fair indeed? Thine hair more wonderful, thy bosom brighter? Is there more speed In thy swift foot than in the feet of flying Dear soft-foot maids? Dost thou, love, triumph when the others sighing Wind wind-blown braids? Hast thou within thine eyes a flame that brightens The land and sea And all the moonlit far-spread prospect lightens, Far vale and lea? Doth the corn-land for thee glow yet more golden, The fields more bright,â Are the far purple hills to thee beholden For strange sweet light? Hast thou the hand of goddess on the shallows Of waste grey sea? Dost thou make green the soft low-lying fallows That yearn for thee? Dost thou bestow upon the woods their splendour When autumn fires The leaves with touch most passionately tender And flame inspires? Do the white Northern waves their well-loved daughter Behold in thee? Art thou the queen of all these leagues of water, This strange fierce sea? Is there in thee the mystic full completeness That Venus brings? Within thy breast the scents of sudden sweetness That fill her wings? Are there upon thy mouth the goddess' roses And in thine arms The subtle force that round a lover closes Resistless charms? Hast thou within thy lips her power attractive That lifts and slays? Hast thou been through the viewless ages active, In far wild days? And now thou standest girl-like yet most splendid On this gold shore And all the winds and waves in one song blended Thy beauty adore: And all the flowers in million hidden places At thy feet kneel And love with fiery wings thy footstep chases And fierce appeal: And I gaze at thee, loving, yet not loving, But marvelling more, Feeling as though my trembling foot were moving O'er some strange shore; And ever, when I see thee, through the splendour Of thy strange eyes Grey-green and cruel and swift and great and tender Sweet magic flies, And thou art Venus, and I bend before thee, And thou art white, And in the sea's song I thy bard adore thee, And in its light, And in the ripples that o'er ten thousand rivers Leap high and fail; And in the haze that o'er the mountain quivers; The wind's wild wail; And in the chant of thunder-clouds sonorous, And in the waves' Moonlit ineffable approachless chorus That rings round graves, And in the laughter of the wide creation I laugh with thee O thou, love's marvellous mystic incarnation, Born of the sea! All poets have loved thee; thou the same for ever Shinest o'er their dreams: They shudder, faint, but they escape thee never, Nor thine eyes' gleams. They shudder for joy and faint for very wonder When thou dost come Crowned with the lightning, robed about with thunder, Making earth dumb. They faint for joy and weep for exultation When thou dost shine Through their soft songs upon each listening nation Through thee divine. They all have loved thee, and they all have maddened At thine embrace, Crowned, killed, and risen again, and slain and saddened, At thy same face! They all have loved thee,âbut not one has found thee, Nor held nor chained, Nor in the embrace irrevocable bound thee, Nor thee retained. Thou crownest them with the old unearthly splendour Of mouth and limb, Sweet, imperturbable, past passion tender, Till hearts grow dim: But though they follow alert and full of daring They fail to keep Thy living glory, though all alike are sharing Thy sombre sleep: The sleep that follows after passion truly They all may share; But while they share it, thou art twining newly Thy brown bright hair; And ever anew thou art incarnate, lady, In new sweet form, Now manifest 'mid valleys calm and shady And screened from storm; Now by the old white waves where thy birth once gladdened The wandering foam; There I beheld thee, gazed at thee and maddened,â In thy first home. And ever the same madness charms and seizes Both heart and hand When brows are swept by sacred summer breezes From thy far land; And ever through the din of daily labour If music speaks, With wings more keen than keen blue-bladed sabre My winged soul seeks The far white seas where I, sweet, first beheld thee And in wild dream Knew that the very might of Love impelled thee, And marked the gleam Of Venus' eyes in thine, superb, entrancing, Beyond all speech Divine, with the old immortal laughter dancing That the old gods teach. For that swift laughter fills thine eyes and flowing From these to mine Fills all my urgent heart with fiery glowing Hot quick fierce wine, And lifts me far beyond the daily portal Of daily deeds Towards the clear fathomless far skies immortal Whereto love speeds. Art thou then woman, or art thou the burning Sweet Venus-form Ever to earth in newer shape returning, More soft, more warm, Maddening us more with blossom-like sweet bosom And new girl-speech, Ever an untouched unimagined blossom For love to reach? Art thou upon the old grey cliff reposing A woman, sweet,â Or are the gods again through thee disclosing Their hearts' wild heat And art thou sent, with the eyes that lured all singers, On one soul still With perfect touch of pure imprisoning fingers To work thy will? WHAT SHALL BE: A SONG OF WEARINESS. I. Ah me! what strange relief when never more By hill or lake or shore The tender summer airs for us are sweet,â When no flowers front our feet. When the last sun has risen, the last moon set, Then shall we not forget? When the last laughing red mouth has been kissed, We'll fly, and not be missed! When the last gracious love-word has been said, We'll seek the loveless dead And bring them songs that found on graceless earth Just soil enough for birth But neither suns nor moons nor stars to shield Their growth in fallow field Nor love of hearers nor desire of souls Who cluster round earth's goals. II. Ah! when the weary weary weary way Is traversed and the grey Dim breakers desolate of death's grim sea Surge and advance and flee, So near at last we hear their salt mouths sing, What peace their song shall bring! For then at last we know that no more flowers Shall flame for us in bowers And that love's message shall no more mislead Nor passion's bright heart bleed Nor feet that struggle on the temporal way Be duped, and led astray. The golden valleys will be full of corn And great suns greet the morn; The purple hills will flame with far-spread heather In the blue solemn weather; The woods will all be scented from the crowd Of meadow-sweet wind-bowed; The seas will laugh and all the breezes sing; The black-berry copse will ring Just as of old to merry maidens' mirth And all the same old earth Be veiled in May-bloom and in jocund green And rathe flowers peep between The enravelled foliage and close-clustered stems With nodding diadems And all the innumerous founts and rills and brooks That permeate dusky nooks Shall babble onward, and the hedge shall shine With August eglantine And lovers' lips shall meet,âbut we shall know No more that this is so. III. The weary flowers shall find us then no more Nor the waves sound on shore; Nor fierce desires of wayward temporal things Then agitate our wings; Nor mad capricious passion sweeter than Furze-scent when it began And far more arid than the arid sea When once its first wild glee Lessened,âshall reach us in that silent land Where soon our feet shall stand. Never shall sweet scent rouse us any more Nor beauty round us pour Ineffable desire and splendid grace Of her tumultuous face And all the urgent rapture of her wings Whereto grey sorrow clings. Not gold nor black nor auburn hair, nor brown, Not one most sweet rose-crown, Not sweetest smiling of a woman's face Nor her most tender grace Nor whitest bosom filled with forest-balm Shall lift us from our calm,â The sacred calm unending and supreme That follows every dream,â The terrible pure calm that holy death Seals with her signet-breath,â The calm whereto all we, swift spirits, go As the years onward flow,â The final calm that never trump shall break Nor love's own whisper wake. IV. Not all the lures that lured us once shall then Speak and be heard again: Not summer laughter in the leafiest trees Nor June-sweet breath of breeze Nor June-soft flutter of foliage in the air Nor gorse-bloom deep and rare With subtle scent that steeps us in a dream Wherethrough strange phantoms stream. Nought of these things shall rouse us from our sleep; Nor groan of thunder deep Nor splendid red attire of autumn leaves Whereat the love-wind grieves Nor golden August smiling 'mid the corn Nor crimson jocund morn Nor village rebeck sounding o'er the plain Nor tanned autumnal grain Nor monstrous murmur of Decembral waves That triumph o'er men's graves Nor moonlit lisp of ripples as they march 'Neath the moon's silver arch Nor splendour of the innumerable stars And all their glowing cars Nor blue-black inlets of the mountain-lake Where russet rushes shake Nor briony-berries with their flaming red Nor campion's milk-white head Nor gentianella pure and skiey-blue, Heaven-exquisite in hue,â Nor pink geraniums, nor the star-wort green That in the trench is seen Nor speedwell tender as the heaven's own eye Nor tufts of grass that sigh In the June-wind with blossom-laden crests Nor the white lilies' breasts,â Not one thing of these things so passing fair Shall make us as we were Or lift from slumber our desirous eyes That yearn not for new skies But only for the immitigable sleep Endless, unbroken, deep. V. And shall God's heaven or gold harps rouse us then, We wearied-out dead men, When all these fragrant fair things cannot rouse Or flood our narrow house With new desire and sweet, and bring new joy Wherewith to sport and toy? What hope for lyres and harps in heaven, or sweet Sound as of angels' feet,â What can their utmost efforts pale and spent Bring dead souls of content? Can they rouse dead hearts when a sweet live rose Wherein the summer glows Had nought of power to rouse,âwhen woman's breath Failed to undo our death? Whom woman cannot wake is dead indeed Past hope of heaven or creed,â Him shall the utmost thunders fail to wake Who lives not for her sake, And all God's tremors of judgment pass him by Who in spite of her would die. If the red luscious mouth of woman-rose Can lift us not, who knows What joy can lift us or what hope can bloom Yet, on our hopeless tomb? Yea, she lifts not,âwe are in peace at last And all our life is passed, Joys, sorrows, passions, splendours, all are gone, Not one frail bud lives on, And men forget us though they hear our song Still, for its voice is strong,â Hear it in sighing of the insatiate waves And wintry wind that raves And in the summer whisper of the leaves Trembling round cottage-eaves And in the heart of women too it sounds And its live breath abounds. VI. But we return not: never never more Shall all our hearts be sore With the sheer travail and laborious care Life gave for robe to wear; Passion and love have done for us their best And white hands have caressed And rabid mouths have cursed and many have railed And red swords have assailed And roses have been sweet and violets blue Bathed in translucid dew And gardens wonderful have held us deep Hidden in magic sleep And tender arms have with their gracious care Made many seasons fair And mouths ephemeral have seduced our own With their ephemeral tone And lips eternal sacred and divine Have kissed us for a sign And on the lonely footpath we have bled Till purple flowers and red Sprang in our traces,âmany moons have shone And gay suns waved us on And fields innumerable of swaying green Upon our path been seen And waves have tempted us with glittering blue Seductive transient hue And mountainous tides have foamed across our path Terrible in white wrath And sometimes pain hath cradled us to rest Half with a mother's breast And agony our very souls hath wrung,â And through it all we've sung,â And through it all we've struggled towards the high Sheer unattempted sky,â And now the strife is over and we sleep,â And what we've planted, reap. VII. But who shall wake us? Shall we slumber long, Silent, devoid of song, Or shall we bring to lower lands a voice Bidding dead hearts rejoice,â A breath of England and the English seas, A whisper of the breeze, A message to the English harps that sleep In deathland-valleys deep, Bidding them know that we on earth retain The memory of their reign And that from earliest singer to the last Their melodies have passed Into the heart of England, making fair The fountains of her air And making strong the splendour of her seas And vocal her great breeze And filling all her deep proud heart with might, Her regal eyes with light, Her hands with valour and her face with pure Rich joy that doth endure: Raising her by their song above all lands And giving with wide hands Their great and deathless spirits for her to take, Made deathless for her sake,â Rendering her rose-like in the midst of free Girdle of circling sea And ever sweet and gracious with perfume From their own souls' white bloom And glorious with the mastery of their might And with their beauty bright And lifted by their force to lands afar Untrodden of sun or star Whose sacred fields alone have yet been trod By imminent live God Where they in lordly triumph and high state For new dead singers wait When these too pass and leave their country higher For all their love and fire, Mingling with many a mighty poet dead And lordly vanished head Till all the mighty choir one day complete In deathless chorus sweet Makes song more wave-like, England, then for thee Even than thy choir-like sea. LOVE-BLOOM: THIRTY SONNETS. IV. IF. If we could give each other what we sawâ The spirit of gladness of the early hours, The spirit of sweetness in the long-lost flowers, And all the deep divine sea's sense of awe, And young divine hearts free from stain or flaw, And all youth's sacred and unsullied powers,â If we could see once more the green sweet bowers, Freed from all pangs of later life that gnaw,â If once for us again the waves could gleam As blue and tender as in love's first dream, And once again the sunset flame as grand As o'er the mountains of the long-lost land, How would our souls that grow forlorn and old Take from the rapture a diviner mould! X. LIGHT LOVE. âThe author of these Sonnets, styling himself Proteus, acknowledges thereby a natural mood of change. He here lays bare what was once his heart, to the public, but what for good or evil is his heart no longer. He stands upon the threshold of middle life, and already his dreams are changed. The gods of his youth have ceased to be his gods.â âPreface to âThe Love Sonnets of Proteusâ. There are whose loves are new with every morn: Who wear love like a robe,âthen cast away, Deeming eternal love a thing to scorn And passion a bright bird who will not stay With mortals ever, or his wings delay:â The sorrow of such upon the breeze is borne A sobbing tuneless note, a wail forlorn, That mixes with the wild wind's plumage grey. But we, great spirit, are we such as these? Nay, round us breathes the promise of soft spring; Ripples an endless laughter through the trees; The blue streams as with God's own joyance sing; Life is the bird that dwells with us nor flees, And death's the dark-hued fast-receding wing. XII. THY SOUL. Thou hast no weakness of the common soul Within thee: thou hast breathed the mountain-air Of God, and found the angels' singing fair, And heard the eternal tides that surge and roll Upon the heavenly shores:âthou dost control With will indomitable thine own rare Most fiery spirit, and dost the yearning share Of those who pant but for the proudest goal. Thou art a woman-flame: thou would'st consume With thine own fervour smaller souls if these Beheld thee as thou art; but swathed in ease And wrapped in fragrant mists of valley-bloom Such apprehend not ever what thou art, Nor fathom the hill-grandeur of thine heart. XIII. AND YET. And yet thou art a woman very sweet: A woman-spirit with a woman's face, Beautiful, tender, gentle, full of grace, With heart that doth for woman's rapture beat. Thou hast climbed the mountains with no sluggish feet,â Yet art thou happy in a green still place By quiet pools o'er which the swallows race, Resting awhile from aspiration's heat. Because thou art so great, thou art most fair, And highest spirit because softest rose, And softest rose because the mountain-air Bracing and gracing round about thee blows, And gentlest woman because clear and rare And swift and splendid God's thought through thee flows. XIV. âDOST THOU CONTEMN ME?â Dost thou contemn me in that I am red? The stains of battle are upon my limbs And with the strenuous war-cry my brain swims; I am not fit for bower or lady's bed. The sword-blades seem to circle round my head E'en now in thought, and dust mine eyesight dims; Am I a man for love or marriage-hymns,â To whom a rose as thou art should be wed? Thou art red too, but red as is a rose Of perfect petals: I am flawed and marred And weary and grim and battle-streaked and scarred,â My head-piece has the dints of ceaseless blows, And I have ridden for years with visor barred; Are mine arms where a woman should repose? XV. CAN I BE SILENT? Nay! can my voice be silent when my heart Is never silent? Can my lyre be dead When every morn the fresh sun's tuneful head Glitters anew across wide fields of Art? Words cannot tell the whole,âbut they tell part; Not in a sonnet, love, thy lips are red, And not in verse our spirit-hands are wed, But yet through verse soft thoughts and gracious dart. Sing, love, I must: I cannot hush my lyre Or still the music-yearning that thy face, Thy soul, thy wit, thy beauty, do inspire; Along the song-course still my feet must race, For easier could the sun forsake the sea Than I could fail, sweetheart, to sing of thee! XXII. DEATH AND FREEDOM. But ought I so to sorrow? How thy chains At the death-angel's touch would fall away! How for thee flame would flush life's waters grey! How death, though life's hand lingers and refrains, Would crash along thy fetters! how new plains Of life in the first light of heaven's clear day Would open out before thee; the long fray Would then be over,âwashed away its stains! Death's hand to thee will be the hand of love Destroying every bolt and every chain; Bursting the prison of thy life-long pain; Descending wave-resistless from above: Love's hand, God's voice saying, âLo, thou art free! Thou hast conquered self;ârejoice: thou art the sea!â XXIV. LOVE'S LAND. How old and weary are we till we meet! Then love with laughter and with joyous speech Gathers the boyish pebbles on the beach And every primrose is past praising sweet. What soft airs gladden us,âwhat swift thoughts beat Along our hearts that were so faint and sore; And now we hear the old waves' mellow roar And tread beside them with fresh vigorous feet. So sweet it was! the night fell round our eyes With tenderest touching, as of woman's hand, And folded us in depths of dark-blue skies, And the dear waves plashed softly on the strand, And dreamy words passed into dreamier sighs, And only sweetest love possessed the land. A REPUBLICAN PRINCESS; OR, THE DEATH OF MESENTZOFF. âOh, am I not as white and soft and sweet As any blood-royal princess of them all? Yea, whiter, softer, sweeter!âin that I Hold, fragrant now within my woman's flesh, The flowers of all the years that are to be: In that the fair Republic's future bliss Shines now within me,âin that every rose, Each lily, of the future, in my lips Or on my hands is snow-white or is red; This very measureless and soft desire Wherewith I cleave to thee, O love, to-night Is but the immeasurable and vital flame That burns deep in the deep Republic's heart. I am the white Republic: and I give In woman's burning yielding snow-white flesh The splendour of its future unto thee. It is incarnate in my body and soul, The body and fervent soul wherewith I clasp Thy body and thy lustrous spirit to-night. Oh kiss me the Republic: cling to me The tender pure Republic lying here Naked and limitless beneath thy gaze. Because in me the agony and the tears Of all who yet have suffered for the sake Of Freedom and of Love are gathered up: Because in my one spirit I can include The sorrow of the past and every pang Of patriot stricken upon the battle-field Or patriot-woman stricken as deep at home, God grants me as reward the power to give To thee the sweet Republic's soul to-night. O lover, take it,âtake me: taking me, Take the Republic warm within thy arms. âLo! there is yet a blood-spot on thine arm! See now I kiss it; damp it is e'en now, So hasty and so rapid was thy flight! I tinge my lips with this the recreant blood Of executed Mesentzoff, and then I kiss the disc of crimson back to thee My lover, soâand so; art thou content? Art thou content that Freedom's spotless God, Having rescued thee the executioner, The carrier-out on traitor Mesentzoff Of holy Freedom's passionate decree,â Having delivered by his arm of might Thy soul from the pursuers, now hath given One woman's blossom of unmeasured praise To thee the blood-stained doer of the deed? Art thou content? Oh how I love thee, sweet, Now that thou art not white but stained and red! Yea, be thou red,âfor ever red: and I Will be thy whiteness, thine unstained pure flesh, Thy spotless body, when before the throne Of God we answer for to-day's high deed. And Mesentzoff; where is his spirit now? Dead with the dead souls; crowned amid the kings Whose burning restless treacherous strange eyes Are the eternal torches that illume Their own eternal torments in the hell Whereto betrayers of their country plunge When at the dagger's mandate (as to-day The sacred dagger spoke!) the wide earth gapes, Laughing, to let them through; and down they speed With groans of women tortured and of men Downtrodden, for their clamorous charioteers. âThere's Mesentzoff!âand, sweetheart, where are we? In imminent danger of our livesâbut yet In heaven: in the thick of Paradise, Right in its very central sweetest bower: Husband and wife beneath the smile of God. That blood-spot is our ruby wedding-ring, And the pursuers are the priests who clinch The august and swift, impetuous ceremony. A murderer they'll call thee; even now I seem in thought (or is it in very deed?) To hear their hoarse and sanguine-throated shouts: Murderer, I kiss thee; kiss me, murderer,â And mingle souls thus through the fierce close lips! âMake much of me: the morning over-soon Will come,âthe grey and lurid morn of doom Perhaps; Oh make the most of me to-night! I give thee all I promised,âdo I not? Am I not true? Am I not faithful wife? Am I not pure and faithful helpmate, dear, Giving thee all the chaste fit fruit of love? Oh I am but a woman after all, And I would live,âyea I would live with thee In some sweet island in the sunny West Or in the sunnier East; I would not die. I would bear children unto thee, my love, Would know the rapture of a quiet home, The tender pure divine domestic joys That other women know, and then despise, Heed not, contemn, think little of; oh ne'er Before this, did I dream how sweet a thing Might love in all its simple issues be! Love I despised; or held it as a crown That only in the life beyond the grave Should be upon my patient forehead worn. But now I love love: thou hast taught me this; Love on for ever! let our joy prevail Through sunrise and throughout another day And night, and through the sweet eternity. O love, man, hero,âwould that in the world, Yea, in the starry universe of God, There were no other blossom than thy mouth, And that for ever I might gather that, And fill my soul for ever with the bloom And passionate fragrance of that endless flower. âAh, I am tender with thee now, and with Myself: I would not die, I would escape, Fly with thee somewhere; be thy happy bride. Can we not shun pursuit, and ere the morn Be far upon some sweet untrodden way, Some road to France or England, happier lands Where Freedom needs not, as in this our home, To sit with armÃ¨d hands and watchful head? YetâI would stay with thee for ever here, Live here, die here; pass from our glory here To Paradise; I know not what I wish,â I only know that perfect love is sweet, And that thou art my perfect flower of joy, My king, my gold-haired lover,âmy delight. âPlay with my hair: it is a girl's for thee, Untouched, unhandled,âas my body was For thee a maiden's two short hours ago; Is now a woman's and a wife's indeed. Cling close,âI'll be thy mother now, and hold Thee the boy-murderer in my safe strong arms, Empty too long of any gift to hold. Hector-Andromache I'll be to thee! Sweet mother, sister, father, all in one, And wife as well,âand even more than wife; I'll be to thee the sweet Republic-Bride, The chainless advent of the kiss of God. Ah! weary hath my life been; never yet Have I beheld a flower of love to press Close to my bosom thus; now thee I press Close, close, and kiss thee with the fervour poured Into my lips by lonely life-long pain. Thou hast done thy deed; and I, I do my deed, Fulfil my promise: virgin, holy, white, I give myself, a flower of fire, to thee. Our strong Republic's gathered ardour now Burns through my veins: I am no more a girl, Woman no more, a human being no more, But one wild measureless surpassing flame, A princess of the royal blood of God. And as that princess I reward thee, sweet, Falling from heaven like some superb white star To crown thy crime, thy murder: thy divine Dagger that smote the tyrant to the dust. Bring near that daggerâwe may need it yetâ Yes, place it underneath the pillow,âso,â Nay, let me kiss it first: now place it there. Who knows? we too may need it ere the morn! Now turn so,âturn half-round; a mother must Make her child comfortable in his sleep. âSleep shall we? or shall we watch out the night? Or wilt thou sleep, and shall I, star-like, watch? Or wilt thou be the star, with that gold hair, And shall I be the night with deep black locks Shrouding the star in soft sweet blackness poured About it? or shall we like children sleep One short glad sleep,âthen face what fate may bring? Ah! let us both sleep: let me, wife for once, Sleep on God's earth one simple wedded sleep, And in thine husbandly protecting arms Forget e'en the Republic for awhile. âHow long have we slept? See the light begins To glimmer at the dawning window-pane! Now once again we are Republicans; The crimson morning is our blood-red sash; Love, let us twine the dawn across our breasts, And fearless face the morrow: Oh, I am proud, Proud, eager, dauntless, shameless, womanly, More sweetly virginal than ever yet In all my maiden-lifetime I have been. Shall women cry âShame on meâ?âI will cry âFoul shame on them who in their ignorance Have known not love or freedomâ; yea, I'll face The angels seeking flowers wherewith to adorn God's heavenly dwelling-house, and I will fling Towards them my ringless and unwedded hand, Crying âHere is a lily,âtake it: you Will find no lily in the fields of God Sweeter, no blossom purer: bear it up And let God smiling wear it next his heartâ. âNow ere the dawn is on us kiss once more: One last embrace,âoh am I not a queen, The queen of Russia and the queen of heaven And queen of the Republicâand of love? Cannot a queen kiss? Are my lips not royal? Oh fear me not, shrink not, but let me pass Like some swift fire across thy lips and face, Burning them into death, and into life Beyond all death, and all that death can do. Oh, but a few short wondrous hours ago Thou wast in flight, pursued by vengeful men, The natural avengers of thy deed, Whom we can pity, whom we do not blame,â They know not what they do,âbut now thou art Warm, safe, impalaced in a woman's arms. Like all God's contrasts, sudden and divine The breathless marvellous change is; swift as if Upon some bitter bleak December day, With white snow beating at the frozen roofs, Sweet summer and the scent of roses came In at the window suddenly,âand the sun Flamed suddenly as in August,âand the sky Gleamed suddenly as in June, one sheet of blue. I am thy sun, thy summer, thy blue sky, Thy fragrant tender rose: God gives in me The first divine most excellent soft glimpse Of heavenly summer, and of heavenly flowers. Love, taste my lips,âis that a royal kiss, And that, and that, and that; am I not sweet? Am I not sweet for thee? pleasant to thee? Am I not sweet to sight and touch and taste, Soft to thine handling, tender to thy grasp,â Am I not sweet all overâjust one bed Of summer-sown intoxicating flowers? See how I humble and abase myself Just out of very royal utter love, Because thou art so noble, and a king, A murderer and a republican, Making myself a captive unto thee, A slave, whom thou may'st do with as thou wilt, Use as thou wilt,âand yet a royal queen, Royal and republican, and all divine, Free even in the midst of thine embrace. âAnd now the last kiss: dost thou love me, love? Am not I splendid? Am I not pure white, Unflecked, unflawed,âmarble from head to foot? I am, thou sayest; and since thou art so red, Red with that bright deed, thou art pure white too, Equal with me, my partner and my crown. Oh, one white splendid yearning trembling dear Delicious delicate untouched divine Most amorous fervid pure impassioned flower, I cast myself with all my fiery hair, Soft, terrible, upon thee,âand I show In these my lips that burn thy pale lips through The power of the Republic, who deputes Me, me, its sacred woman-messenger To kiss the approval of to-day's bold deed Into thy very spirit, and to show How after death comes life, and after lifeââ [Voices are heard outside. âThe murderer of Mesentzoff is here.â [She gives him the dagger, first kissing it gently. âKill me and kill thyself: 'tis better so.â [The police break into the apartment. âBoth dead! Both gone with Mesentzoff to-day Along the same cold road! See how she clings E'en in her death, bride-like, about his neck And how her black hair covers all his face. Leave them and send for women: little enough These murderer-lover mad Republicans Have left for us, the avenging hands, to do.â Dec. 16, 1878. THE PRIEST AND HIS WIFE. A DRAMATIC LYRIC. The priest is dull; his thought is lame: But is the priest's wife quite the same? Hath her warm heart no thoughts of flame? The priest hath barren lips and thin: But are there not full lips to win? And is the touching them a sin? The priest hath sleek black shiny vest: Who hath the yearning uncaressed White fragrant splendid fluttering breast? The priest speaks weary words by day: But are there not soft words to say To some one in the twilight grey? How long his sermon is and cold! How sweet her glance half-shy, half-bold! And ah! the sun on locks of gold! His room is full of parchments dry! But is there not a chamber nigh Where laughing Love heard lovers sigh? O fool,âand wilt thou quit the place Because the preacher's soul lacks grace! Behind him shines another face! No preacher ever slew the stars! They beam behind his prison-bars! Gold Venus! Laughing bright-locked Mars! The priest is dull; his thought is slow: But is the priest's wife even so? The stars and flowers of last night know! ALICE OF THE SEA. I The windy surgy sea Was as the soul of thee, O Alice of the sea, and of the bower Where Love in tender light With face and body bright Shone through youth's one divine impassioned hour. II Not any dreary town Thou hadst, O love, for crown,â But all the untrodden deep impetuous waters Urgent in gathered wrath Were strenuous round thy path, O fairest-eyed of all earth's fair-eyed daughters! III The miles of golden corn At thy glad breath were born And all the blue sun-nurtured summer weather Smiled tenderly round thee, And all the sun-kissed sea Laughed,âas we trode the clamorous beach together. IV The endless hopes of youth Were thine, and fervent truth Waved round thy form exultant her white wings, And glittering fancies past Before thee on the blast And many sacred dreams of many things. V Not in the August air Alone, love, thou wast fair, But in the days of dreams that followed thee; By hills of other lands The magic of thine hands Was felt, and thy foot fell by many a sea. VI Never a summer came But in the robe of flame And flowers that wrapped each summer's soft shape round Thou wast,âand the urgent seas Still washed as toward thy knees And still thy beauty winter's chains unbound. VII Into the strange dim land Of Poesy thine hand Imperious and girl-queenly beckoned me: And there I found again With throbs of joy and pain The clear divine unaltered spirit of thee. VIII Though round about my head, Now the old dream hath fled, Loves many and of other shores have bound Red flowers, and white and pale, Are such wreaths of avail If on life's lintel once thy foot doth sound? IX If once the sense of seas Comes, and of gracious breeze That o'er the wide luxurious tideway hovers, How vanishes the town, And all its gateways frown, While smile the sandy cliffs and short oak-covers! X Again the ripples dance Before our eager glance, O Alice of the giant-memoried sea: And suns long-hidden shine, And pliant gold woodbine I weave into a circlet meet for thee. XI Thy beauty made the air Of summer yet more fair And every rose of summer softer still: Thy sweetness made the days Diviner and my lays Flash forth like light-beams sparkling down a rill: XII Thy splendour made the white Waves but a lesser sight And all the moon-beams but inferior rays: Thy glory made my dreams Resplendent with wild gleams,â Made marvellous the far-lit water-ways: XIII Thy softness made each morn A joy-god newly born: Thy tender love was as the hand of thee Moulding all things anew Beneath emergent blue That flamed no more storm-shadowed o'er the sea: XIV Thy laughter made the land No more a waste of sand Whereover hopeless roamed youth's shuddering tread, But one wide land of flowers Wherethrough the honied hours On wings of quivering rainbow-rapture sped. XV No more when thee I saw I felt the old strong awe Of poets, singers elder and divine; I knew that I might meet, Because thy mouth was sweet, Fearless their long and laurel-crownÃ¨d line. XVI I knew that through thy strength My power would come at length And that my grey-eyed Alice of the sea Among their loves would stand, A queen amid the band Of English queens through the wild harp of me. XVII I stood forth,âand I sang; Sometimes with sorrow-pang Smitten, and sometimes pierced with dart of glee; But ever in my sight Keeping thy grey eyes' light And the old light that glistened o'er our sea. XVIII That this one thing be done Ere solemn set of sun I've vowed,âand struggle towards it as I may; That thy name may be high 'Mid names that cannot die, When comes for me the closing of my day: XIX That, when no sound again Is heard, no new love-strain, No further voice or lyre or harp of me, Still may thy memory cling, A white immortal thing, To the world's heart as deathless as the sea: XX That, when the new harps come And men seek back for some Fairest of those who filled to-day with glee, They may with rapture find This singing-wreath I've twined About thy brows, O lady of the sea: XXI With rapture not for sake Of this the song I make, But for the sake of thee the song's white flower; Oh, may the future know Thy beauty, when I go, Silenced at mine inevitable hour! XXII New queens of love will shine, New waves, as white a line, Sweep upward, thundering o'er the yellow sands In autumns crisp and fair,â But will the new years bear As sweet a woman as thou for new glad lands? XXIII Will others of thy name Come, not the very same, But even as fair, with singers at their feet? Will even our old woods thrill To voices and the hill For these be whitened with fresh meadow-sweet? XXIV Yes:âmany a rose most red Though thou and I be dead Shall cast imperious perfume through the land, And many women fair Wind wonderful dark hair Or golden ringlets, shining band on band. XXV New passions shall awake, New hearts with rapture shake, And the same silver moonbeam thrill the sea, When thou and I are gone To loveless lands and wan,â Sweetheart, what shall abide of thee and me? XXVI My singing shall abide: This vision of my Bride: And all our songful glory of meadow-sweet That fadeless and in flower We gift with living power To blossom even around our vanished feet. XXVII The new glad streams shall sound And new delight abound And new loves' silvery laughter fill with glee The woods where we with slow Step wandered long ago; Again young hearts shall dream beside our sea. XXVIII But as for us we pass Beyond earth's flowers and grass; No mortal foot may pause, but onward each Hurries to things unseen, Through pale springs and the sheen Of golden summers, and wild autumns' speech. XXIX Never again we tread The old land: it is dead: Never the green cliffs quite the same shall stand For us,âor the blue seas Answer the self-same breeze, Or hand thrill quite as softly tingling hand. XXX Never a rose escapes The winter and new-drapes Its beauty: never, Alice of the sea, Shall quite the same eyes meet Mine own, or same voice greet My coming,âor the same love gladden thee. XXXI But ever through my song The same waves sound their strong Triumphant paean,âand the streams pervade The woods with silver speech And moons illume the beach And white flowers fill the tangled forest-shade. XXXII In song they speak again; My singing is the fane Wherein thou art enshrined with all thy flowers; There is not one which fails, From all those summer vales, To adorn thine own perennial singing-bowers: XXXIII Not one bud pale and dim But blossoms in my hymn; Not one moon-silvered wavelet but doth sound Within the singing walls Wherethrough my spirit calls To thee; wherein thine answering soul is found: XXXIV Not one rose but is grand Within the singing-land, And oh, thou sea-sweet woman, thou art there Never diviner yet, Nor tenderer eyelids wet; Never more queenly,ânever yet more fair: XXXV Unchanged and as of old Thine hand in mine I hold Within the singing-temple I have made, And through its arches clear Thy ringing laugh I hear And robelike round me falls love long-delayed: XXXVI And with our words the tides Mix, on the same shore-sides, And voices of the woods,âthy soul and me Blending in love as fair As August morning's air When first we met, O Alice of the Sea! IN HER ROOM. And canst thou find no way, O wise male lover,â No road by which the craving hearts may meet And joined lips drink of passion's cup so sweet? Doth day provide no bower, nor darkness cover? Is there no rose-hung path for yearning feet? Art thou so puzzled, lover tall and solemn, With locks thick-sprinkled with the thoughtful grey? Doth passion torture thee from day to day? Can ye not kiss for foes in serried column? Oh, trust the woman: she will find a way! Thou art so wise and yet so foolish surely! Thou art seeking for some far spear-guarded hill Where the soft trembling mouths may have their will: But lo! the woman beckons thee demurely Towards her own red-geraniumed window-sill. Right in the midst of friends and guardians, blind one, Love ever love's reward most safely reaps: Lo! the fool-husband in the next room sleeps, And he shall watch so that no foe shall find one; Yea, he shall guard,âwhile breast on bosom weeps! There is no safer than her own sweet chamber, Whereto the passion-mad pale roses creep Hovering with tender scent above her sleep: Whereto, if thou so willest, thou mayest clamber, And drink her beauty through the darkness deep. There is no sweeter than her own bed whitely Seen through the soft still darkness of the room; White,âbut less white than her own white rose-bloom; Here thou mayest rest with noble freedom nightly While her arms struggle towards thee through the gloom. And he shall watch: for is he not so simple And blind and honourless and all impure As to believe that bolts and bars secure! Because he cares not for her Venus-dimple, He thinks that passionate cheek cannot allure! So he shall watch and God-condemned be guard At his own ignominy; damnÃ¨d fool: Who thinks a woman can be trained by rule And all her boundless soul pent-up and barred And all her measureless passions put to school! Hark! in that kiss the thunder of God descends, Thou fool, upon thee! Thou hast no flower now. Behold, the ring wherewith she once did vow Upon another's finger shines; so ends The miserable farce: be happy, thou! Turn in thy sleep and sigh with calm content; Thou hadst a wife; thou hast a wife no more: The morning sun now gildeth hill and shore, And love's wild streams that through long years were pent Adown the eddying echoing valleys roar. âHE WILL NOT SEE!â I Are the eyes fairer than the dawn of day, More tender-hued than tenderest sea-shine's grey, Divine to me? Are the lips redder than a budding rose And hands more white than lily when it blowsâ He will not see! II Are the swift glances swift as Helen's were When for her sake the old-world amorous air Trembled with glee? Hath he a peerless woman at his side, Fit for a great-browed god's soft-bosomed bride, Yet doth not see? III Hath he beside him her flower-body bright Through the long hours of many a summer night, With love's land free? Yet will he enter not, hand locked in hand, The fragrant alleys of that mystic landâ Will he not see? IV Are the red lips left lone, and unembraced The neck, and winter-bound the glowing waist,â Must this sin be? He will not see her though his head may rest Close by her curved magnificent still breast,â But love shall see! HARROW V. ETON AT LORD'S. 1881. I. 1 Just twenty years ago I heard the same shouts sounding, Myself a Harrow boy, not knowing what should come: To-day I watch the ball o'er the live hedges bounding, And as I look back all my heart is sick and dumb. 2 If any knew his fate, would any live I wonder! Upon the same hill-side where my young fancies grew The wave of Byron's life that burst in flame and thunder First gathered force,âthen paused, ere its full power it knew. 3 Would he have lived? Would any, knowing all the sorrow And all the pain that love in the near future brings, The boyish life once spent, endure the chill to-morrow And live when living means to crawl with broken wings! 4 O far green Harrow fields that Byron loved, and splendour Of blue clear Harrow skies, I think of you to-day, While clear above the ground the pale-blue sky hangs tender, Breaking in streaks through clouds and London's chronic grey. 5 To-day I hear the shouts and all my spirit glances Straight back o'er twenty years, and I can hear the sound As then I heard,âagain my heart with pleasure dances When a grand Harrow hit curls far beyond the bound! 6 But then the twenty years with speechless desolation Weigh on me like a mount of awful granite stone: Years of desire and failure, love and tribulation, And starless hopeless nights and happiness o'erthrown! 7 And through them all there gleam the eyes that first impelled me Along new passion's road and changed me to a man: Chained and encircled fast, and charmed and bound and held me, When the soft rose of love to blossom first began. 8 How passing strange to think that these boy-hearts awaking To eager life to-day are ignorant indeed: Yet that on each ere long love's pitiless morning breaking Will change the hearts that sing to weary hearts that bleed! 9 No spirit shall escape the love-doom waiting ready; Ready to seize and bind and shape to newer things: All shall be caught and whirled around the frothing eddy; Few shall emerge with whole unbruised unbattered wings! 10 Ye cannot pause: pass onward; meet your fate quite fearless; And after twenty years if ye be here again, Watching as I now watch with stony heart and tearless, Ye will have learnt that life is love, and love is pain. II. 11 Ye know so little now of what shall surely follow; Your vision reaches not beyond the cricket-field; You Venus touches not, nor gold-harped great Apollo; The sun gleams bright upon each undimmed boyish shield. 12 Yet there shall come a day when sweeter than the laughter Of cricket-comrade brave and many a trusty friend A girl's soft laugh shall sound: a wonderful hereafter Towards which your thoughtless eager swift-foot ways ye wend. 13 Deeper and sweeter things there are than ye are dreaming In this strange world of ours where love is linked to pain: Eyes fairer than the eyes with cricket-rapture beaming; Praise far more thrilling than the praise to-day ye gain. 14 The flowers ye pluck to-day are daisies pure and tender; But ah! there are strange flowers far richer on the way: The awful tameless rose with untouched fiery splendour Flames through the mists that robe the coming years in grey. 15 Wonderful dreams await you! Blossoms soft and burning And the great sun-kissed skies of summers yet unseen: But wait in peace and still to-day's unfevered yearning By mellow ring of bat upon the cricket-green. 16 The future hath its wings and they will overtake you; Rapture may dwell in front,âbut so may fieriest pain: Gather strength that ye may, when passion's wild throbs shake you, Mix with the victor-few, not with the countless slain! July 7, 1881. TO A CRITIC. Thou to parley with a poet, Vapid critic-creatureâthouâ Thou art blind and dost not know it; Dank locks flutter round thy brow; Who art thou to preach and bluster To the fools that round thee cluster,â Hearts that at thy mandate bow? Lo! the poet sings to roses And the hours of summer days: In the woods his heart reposes, 'Mid the rathe green bowery sprays: Lo! the poet hath the foaming Wide seas round his footstep roaming,â Round his brow the awful bays. Through his heart storm strife and anguish; All his soul is white with pain; Often through long hours that languish Must he garner song's red grain: Thou,âthou hast no heart to suffer; When the surges' heads grow rougher Thou in harbour dost remain! When the great seas' hoary splendour Shines beneath the grey low sky, Thou art vanquished: when the tender Flakes of rainbow-froth soar high, Thou art safe in inland region; Though the forms of gods were legion, Storm-tossed, thou would'st not be nigh! What knowest thou of woman's passion, Critic with the mincing tread: Woman loves not in thy fashion; Not for thee the rose is red; Not for thee divine emotion Yearns forth, rippling like the ocean,â Thou, alive, art worse than dead! Thou to teach us, thou to reach us With thy simpering silly ways! Thou to impugn us and impeach us! Thou to chisel and chip our lays! Thou to teach us love's true beauty And to point towards path of duty,â What damnation were thy praise! LONELY. Lonely,âdevoid of help from God or man The poet ploughs his way Through seas of sorrow grey And wan. If neither God will aid nor man's frail heart Nor heart of woman fair, Yet must the poet dare His part. Though he stand inconceivably alone, Anguished unspeakably, Yet hath he sky and sea For throne. Though God be weak and not one rose's breath Gladden,âhe must not sink But sorrow's full cup drink Till death. Nor must he hope for honour or reward: No hope of glory here, Only pain's bleak white sheer Sharp sword. And, perhaps, a leaf or two of scanty bays,â Just one green leaf or two, Yet never summer's blue Sweet days. Never the heyday of the flawless rose: No soul-companionship Though craving lip touch lip That glows. But lonely lingering struggling baffled years And nights when no moon shines And thorn-crowns man's hand twines And tears. JEZEBEL. Who felt the touch of her swift hands,â What lord of sunstruck Eastern lands? Who felt the soft white bosom swell Of Jezebel, of Jezebel? Who, lying on the firm cool breast, Found therein sweeter fairer rest Than ever on priest or prophet fell,â O Jezebel, O Jezebel! We have lost the fashion of thy face; Gone art thou: scattered is thy race: No English breeze in vale or dell Lifts now the locks of Jezebel! Slender wast thou,âor matron-wise Shaped, with black subtle serpent-eyes? Where are the strong men who could tell To us the glory of Jezebel? They all are gone along with thee, And we who pace by grey-blue sea What know we of the souls in hell For thy sake, deep-haired Jezebel! Could one but tell us of thy form! One mouth that kissed thy red lips warm! We too might madden 'neath thy spell O poison-lipped sweet Jezebel! But now we know not, nor shall know While the green English seasons blow, What amorous strange hot hours befell The hearts that loved thee, Jezebel! Long-historied wondrous deathless queen Clasping all time in white arms' sheen, The prophet-dogs have died pell-mell,â Thy lips outlive them, Jezebel! UNCOMPANIONED. At war with all the human race, Where shall I turn my tired-out face? The meadow-sweet hath sun and air; What hath the poet? Grim despair. The sea hath wind and storm and light; What hath the poet? Starless night. Woman hath love and roses' breath; What hath her poet? Pain and death. KEBLE. Is this the voice I'm bidden to hear, When in mine ear Rings sound of solemn midnight seas And voice of trees And spirits who interpret these? Am I to bend my head to thee When all the sea With strenuous chorus sweet and near Sings at mine ear And through its chant God's voice is clear! âGreatest of poets!â some one says! Alas! the bays Have little further weight or worth, They are food for mirth, If such man's song survive on earth! O Church-pent prisoned feeble soul Who ne'er didst stroll Beyond the âlich-gateâ and the porch, Thy spirit's torch How the great sun of song would scorch! The sun that flames around the head Alive or dead Of singer who is made divine By breath of pine Or by the blue far mountain-line. What hath true song to do with thee? Thou with the sea? What hath the summer's fervent blue Sweet depth to do With thy pale fancies' churchyard crew? O God of hills and lakes and seas And swaying trees, Give me no trivial bread and wine But make me thine In the soul-life for which I pine! So shall no church-chant come from me But song of sea And mystic tender blossom-song And many a throng Of passionate thoughts alive and strong. No tender churchless love-thought yet Hath reader met In thy sick arid morbid verse Plumed like a hearse And heavy with thy Church's curse. See Keble's poem called âDisuse of Excommunication,â in the âLyra Innocentiumâ. No simple love of English rose That gleams and blows By quiet English hedge in June Is in thy tune; All blossoms are thy Church's boon! Therefore, O bard, thou art not exempt From our contempt, For we who love the English sea And all things free Hate and despise thy Church and thee. THE YOUTH OF THE WORLD. The dew upon the leaves is wet; We have not travelled far as yet; The blossom Of youth on the world's brows is set. Some think the world is worn and old: Nay! all the world's hair gleams with gold,â Her bosom Soft-white doth soft-white flowers enfold. Full many a long untrodden way She'll traverse ere her locks be grey, Now gilded With splendour at the dawn of day. We have but seen her girlish hours Armful and lapful of wild flowers; Unbuilded Are the great future's towns and towers! New might of love we dream not yet Upon her forehead shall be set, And glory Our longing eyes have never met. The world is like a girl with zone Slender, slim neck, and timid tone,â The story Of love is all a tale unknown. Or, if she loves, she knows not how With all her might of being to bow; Most lightly She binds love's fillet round her brow. Yet there shall come the close sweet kiss, And depth and height of certain bliss, And, nightly, Love's rose, and greed to gather this. Not yet the immeasurable embrace Makes fervent heaven of all her face And splendour Is added to her girlish grace;â Not yet she laughs with near dear eyes Into her lover's,ânor replies With tender Low words wherethrough love's shudder flies. And so the glad world's bridal day Yet tarries,âfar upon the way,â She dallies With love, while love's fierce wheels delay: But when from heaven her bridegroom leaps, Plunging adown the gold-splashed steeps, Or sallies From the sea's loud storm-sundered deeps, She shall, mature of heart and strong, Chant gravely her grand marriage-song That waiteth Silent the far blue hills among. We shall not see:âwe watch afar Like lovers whom sad fate doth mar And hateth,â For whom doth rise not passion's star. As some lorn lover hath to yield His maiden, unto whom he kneeled, And know her White prize of other sword and shieldâ As on the marriage-night he dreams Dreams terrible, when the moon gleams, Full-flower, And through the open window streamsâ So we with sorrow yield our world In far embraces to be furled, As slowly We one by one to doom are hurled. Her majesty of lip and limb Is not for us: it waits for him, The holy Bard hidden within the ages dim. One kiss we've had,âa maiden kiss; But ah! the strong-armed bridegroom's bliss, When eager She holds him,âwhat was ours to this! Our rapture in the youth of things, Though round us many a young throat sings, Is meagre To the great joy the future brings: Meagre as faint embrace of girl, Whose thin lips hardly clasp or curl, To maddening Dim deep soft passionate rapture-whirl When fierce love, sure, mature, and strong, Changes all being to wild song, Swift-gladdening The flooded veins it leaps along. The world's great soul waits virgin yet: The globes of dew are round and wet And pearly On daisy, pink, and mignonette; With virgin girlish eyes cast down She stands, in white unfigured gown,â 'Tis early,â We shall not see her wear her crown. L'ENVOI. âSONG-SPRAY.â Not of flowers in the heart of the mountains Nor of silvery voice of the fountains Nor of leaves of the summer or spring Nor of moss nor of ferns do I sing In this, the new song that I bring. Though the blossom of passion be there And the passionless bloom of despair, Yet, chief of all blossoms for me, And fairer than blossom of tree, Is the bloom of the foam of the sea. âSong-Bloomâ was of love and of hours That dreamed 'mid the bosoms of flowers: But the spray of the sea is in this And the voice of the wind, and its kiss, And the storm's ineffaceable bliss. And the colours of waves and of skies And of clouds as they darken and rise; And, mighty as ever for me, The mingling in measureless glee Of moon and of stars and of sea.</field>
