      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. BOOK THE FIRST. TO FRIENDS. If, generous friends, your memories be not slow, When backward your own goodness ye might trace; And ye will only keep the virtuous pace, Still to do good, and forward still to go; Ye will remember, that a heedless thing, Lingering, as with enchantment, once would stray, Or lost in thought, or borne on fancy's wing, Where willowy Cam glides-on his silent way; (For thought, though solemn, has the power to please, And song, though simple, can from care beguile!) And he would seem to talk with fields and trees, Or forms unseen, that fancy taught to smile: For meâremembrance still shall love those days, If friendship but approve my visionary lays. TO A LADY: WITH SOME VISIONS OF THE AUTHOR'S. Anna, when I that open face survey, And read the gentle language of those eyes, How the dark hour of bigot dulness flies! How springs my soul to hail the cheerful day! What lifts, like female worth, the lyric lay? Hear, then, how long I wander'd, lost in night, Till late, the Muse did with enlivening ray Relume my eyes, and fill with new delight: Then song could please, and charm the soul of woe, Prompt the bold thought, and kindle freedom's fire: And, Anna, this to female worth I owe, And still, at Beauty's call, I strike the lyre. The rapturous youthful dream no more I share, Yet shall the visions live, if they but please the fair. ODE ON THE RETURN OF A PUBLIC ANNIVERSARY. I While War thro' distant nations roams With fiery eye and blood-stain'd spear, And Pity o'er the warriors' tombs Hangs the pale wreath, and drops a tear; While thousands bleed, while thousands die, Let Britons heave the generous sigh. II Mirth hails in vain the festal day; The Muse in vain prepares the song; The note of triumph dies away, And Horror chills the poet's tongue; For thousands bleed, for thousands die, And Britons heave the generous sigh. III By all the gallant warriors slain, By all the tender hearts that mourn, The orphan,âand the widow-train, We pray, sweet Peace, thy blest return! But oh! while thousand Britons die, Let Britons heave the generous sigh. 1794. SONG, WRITTEN FOR AN ANNUAL MEETING OF HEREFORDSHIRE YEOMEN, On occasion of a Popular Election at the end of Autumn. I Lo! smiling with fruit the gay orchards appear, Soon the juice shall enliven the glass, The husbandman welcome the close of the year, And toast in a bumper his lass. Hail tree! so reviving to Englishmen's eyes! What tree upon earth is so fair? Hail juice! not the grape of Italian skies With beverage so sweet shall compare. II But this tree, tho' Britons now call it their own, Was brought from a far distant shore, And, tho' Britain was charm'd, when its value was known, Still it charm'd other nations before. But in England there grew a still more lovely tree, Both the native and pride of the soil, Of life-giving fruit, and of branches so free, That they spread, and look'd fair thro' the isle. III Lo! the nations, on foliage and fruitage so gay, While gazing, with envy repin'd, And a stem, which they seize, bear in triumph away, To plant under heavens more kind. The generous exotic, ye nations, receive, And with patience and industry rear:â Oh! may its rich nectar from sorrow relieve, And the children of Poverty cheer! IV Proceed, youthful tree, fruit a thousand-fold bear, Wide and wide be your branches display'd! And long as its blessings the planters shall share, Let strangers repose in the shade! And ye, Britons, rejoice when ye view the blest tree, As abroad ye may wantonly roam; But beware, while the sapling looks smiling and free, Lest the parent tree wither at home. TO AN ENTHUSIAST. Were you, my friend, some nimble-winged thing, That could with eagle speed extend your flight, Then might you range the world, Then pierce each lonely place: Whether 'twere lazar-house, or dungeon drear, Or hill, or beetling cliff, or time-worn cave, Where Misery sat and sigh'd Her troubles, still unseen; And there, perchance, at eve her hollow eye On the hard stone at times might drop the tearâ As once the dame, who mourn'd Her hapless children's fate. Then had you, gentle friend, the chymic art Of some young bee, that roves from flow'r to flow'r, How fondly might you rove, What balmy sweets exhale! Then, blest employment! with what tender skill Wondering might you those honeyed treasures mix, And form a sovereign balm To heal the mourner's heart! Were you, my friend, some dart-emitting god, Like him, who pierc'd in GrÃ¦cia mortal hearts, How might you range the world, And find each gladsome place! Whether 'twere village green, or city gay, How might you roving find each cheerful scene, Where youths and maidens smile, And carol thro' the day! And when, perchance, with joy-illumin'd eye, Thoughtless of love, they frolic'd in the dance, How might you throw your dart, And flit unseen away! Then you again might change your tiny form, Stand forth the god, protector of the fair, Your head with roses crown'd, And in your hand a torch! Then you might light the lovers on their way, Then sing the song, that should endear their hearts, Till they should love, and love, And still grow old in love! Ah! could you fondly climb yon orient sun, Ride on his beam, and travel round the world, How might you, crown'd with light, Cheer all the nations round! Yes, friend, were you like that refulgent sun, How might you in your daily course dispense Light, liberty, and love, Still travelling to bless! Were youâbut cease, enthusiast, cease your speed; For what avail, O man, fantastic flights? Why muse ideal deeds, Heedless of what is true? You are nor bee, nor sun, nor sprite, nor godâ You are a humble, weak, unwinged thing, The frail inhabitant Of this poor clod of earth! And has not this poor earth, that very spot, Where thou art wont to move, enough of range? Ah! where then would st thou move? Behold your proper sphere! Cease then, enthusiast: thy slender bark, How should it hope to cross the mighty sea? Keep close to shoreâor ah! Thy bark shall founder soon. FROM ANACREON. âAnacreon, you are growing old;â Thus by the women I am told: âTake your glass, and there survey Falling locks and temples gray:ââ But I neither know, nor care, How my locks and temples are: This I know, if old I be, Mirth and Love will quickly flee; And, if Death will soon be here, I should seize the pleasure near. ODE TO THE CAM. I Soon shall the young ambrosial Spring Wanton forth, in garlands gay, And, spreading soft her virgin wing, Shall wed the Lord of day. Soon shall reviving Nature homage yield, And, breathing incense, lead her tuneful train O'er hill and dale, soft vale, and cultur'd field; The bard, the lover, and the jocund swain, Their new-born joys shall sing; earth, sea, and sky, All wake for thee, fair Spring, their sweetest minstrelsy! II What tho' the winds, and sleety shower, May seem awhile to hush the grove? Soon, wak'd by nature's living power, Shall breathe the voice of love? The lark gay-mount, to hail the purple dawn, And its clear matin carol thro' the sky, The throstle's mellow warblings cheer the morn, The linnet softly trill on hawthorn nigh; The mists shall vanish soon, and soon the breeze Kiss every glowing flower, and fan the trembling trees.â III I, too, the cheering warmth shall feel, And join the rapturous choral song, Musing smooth numbers, as I steal, O Cam! thy banks along. Tho' near thy banks no myrtle breathe perfume, No rose unfold its blushing beauties near, Tho' here no stately tulip spread its bloom, Nor towering lily deck the gay parterre: (Inclos'd within the garden's fair domain, These all, in eastern pride, shall hold their golden reign:â) IV Yet wild flowers o'er the fruitful scene, Warm'd by the touch of gentle May, Shall rise, obedient to their queen, In simple beauty gay. To me the violet sheds the richest sweet; To me the kingcup shines with brightest hues; The primrose pale, like modest virtue neat, E'en the meek daisy, can instruct the Muse: Roving with silent eyes, she loves to stand, And in the field-flow'r views a more than master's hand. V E'en now the sunbeam, dazzling-bright, Quick-dances on the crisped stream; And soft, tho' fleeting gales invite The fond poetic dream: Nor does in vain the swan majestic sail, Nor glittering insect range the rushy brink; Nor the fish sporting down the current steal, And the light songsters on the margin drink; Then, wild with bliss, shiver the painted wing, And to their feather'd loves their sweetest wood-notes sing. VI Yet must we leave thy blooming reign:â And short that reign, thou lovely springâ What time Fate's high decrees ordain, Or wills the sovereign King! Yes, all thy shadowy clouds, thy rainbow hues, Thy flowers, and songs, thy gales, and glossy bloom, All must be left, tho' friendly to the Muse; And man, poor man, lie down in cheerless gloom;â That season cold of death shall chill his tongue, Nor beauty's smile return, that wak'd the vernal song. VII But speed the hours on restless wing? Must love's light season flit away? Then hail, O man, the coming spring, And seize the sweets of May: Where now the bard of Camus' classic stream, The skilful hand that wak'd th' Ãolian lyre? Ah! sleeps with him the spring-enamour'd theme, From him the loves, and âVenus' train,â retire.â He too, who trac'd the crystal streams of light, And Nature's spacious fields, great Newton, sleeps in night. VIII No more he treads this hallow'd ground, Nor tracks in thought yon boundless sky; Ah! Science can but gaze around, Then, like the Muse, shall die. Oh! quit then, Fancy, queen of songs and wiles, The pearl-enamell'd grot, the moss-grown cell, Thy many thousand hills, and purple isles, And deign, oh! deign, near sedgy Cam to dwell: Still let the song of love the valleys cheer, And blooming Science spread fair spring-time all the year. A GLEE FOR THE SOMERSET-HOUSE LODGE OF FREEMASONS. Lightly o'er the village green Blue-ey'd fairies sport unseen, Round and round, in circles gayâ Then at cock-crow flit away: Thus, 'tis said, tho' mortal eye Their merry freaks could never spy, Elves for mortals lisp the pray'r, Elves are guardians of the fair. Thus, like elves, in mystic ring, Merry masons drink and sing. Come, then, brothers, lead along Social rites and mystic song! Tho' nor madam, miss, or Bess, Could our myst'ries ever guess; Nor could ever learn'd divine Sacred masonry define, Round our order close we bind Laws of love to all mankind! Thus, like elves, in mystic ring, Merry masons drink and sing. Health then to each honest man, Friend to the masonic plan! Leaving cynics grave to blunder, Leaving ladies fair to wonder, Leaving Thomas still to lie, Leaving Betty still to spy, Round and round we push our glass, Round and round each toasts his lass. Thus, like elves, in mystic ring, Merry masons drink and sing. FROM ANACREON. Bulls with horns kind Nature arms, Guards with hoof the horse from harms; Hares with swiftness she endued, With strength of teeth the lion brood; Fish she taught to swim and play, Birds to fly, and carol gay, Man to reason: but has Heaven Nought to gentle Woman given? Woman moves in beauty's charms Stronger than the force of arms; Charms like helmet that secure, And, like javelin, swift and sure: Helmet, lance of fire, and shield, All to beauteous Woman yield. SONNET. Sweet Maid! when sickness pales that angel-face, Like the rude worm that riots on the rose, Still goodness in thy gentle bosom glows, And beauty will not leave her favourite place. Still round thy languid eye will steal a smile, As underneath a cloud the sun-beams play, Kind harbingers of more resplendent day, Though the full orb conceal himself awhile. But ah! since Melancholy's baleful hand Vile poppy-dews hath o'er thy temples spread, And Death, methinks, looks busy round that bed, All-hopeless Pity near shall take her stand: Oh! she shall spare for thee her softest sigh: For thou wast Pity's child, the friend of Misery. ODE ON THE CLOSE OF AUTUMN, AFTER RAMBLING THROUGH CAMBRIDGESHIRE AND ESSEX. I Now farewell Summer's fervid sky, That, while the sun thro' cancer rides, With chariot slow and feverish eye, Scorches the beech-clad forest-sides! And farewell earlier Autumn's milder ray, Which, the warm labours of the sickle o'er, Could make the heart of swain industrious gay, Viewing in barn secure his wheaten store: What time the social hours moved blithe along, Urg'd by the nut-brown ale and jolly harvest-song. II What different sounds around me rise! Now midst a barren scene I rove, Where the rude haum in hillocks lies, Where the rash sportsman frights the grove. Ah, cruel sport! ah, pain-awakening sound! How hoarse your death-note to his listening ear, Who late, wild-warbled music floating round, Blest the wild warblers of the rising year; Who, as each songster strain'd his little throat, Grateful himself would try the soft responsive note. III Yet still in Autumn's fading form The tender melting charms we trace, Such as, love's season past, still warm The sober matron's modest face; Mild-beaming suns, oft hid by fleeting clouds, Blue-mantled skies, light-fring'd with golden hues, Brooks, whose swoln waters mottled leaves o'erspread, Fields, where the plough its steady course pursues, And woods, whose many-shining leaves might move Fancy's poetic hand to paint the orange grove. IV Oh! still,âfor Fancy is a childâ Still with the circling hours I play, And feast on hips and blackberries wild, Like truant school boy gay: Or eager plunge in cool pellucid stream, Heedless, that Summer's sultry day is fled; Or muse, as breathes the flute, some rural theme, Such theme as Fancy's song may yet bestead; Or, stretch'd at ease, will teach the listening groves, In tuneful Maro's strains, some rosy rustic loves. V Now bear me to the distant wood, And bear me to the silent stream, Were erst I stray'd in serious mood, Lost in some rapturous dream. To me, O Hornsey, what retreat so fair? What shade to me so consecrate as thine? And on thy banks, poor streamlet, did I care For all the spring haunts of the tuneful Nine? Ah! pleasures, how ye lengthen as ye fade! As spreads the sun's faint orb at twilight's dubious shade! VI For, oh pale stream! how many a tear I mingled in thy waters slow! E'en midst the blossoms of its year, Youth takes its tale of woe. And thus thro' life: for what is human life? A changeful day, a motley-tinctur'd scene; How quick succeed the hours of peace and strife! How sombre tints o'erspread the cheerful green! E'en while fair Hope lights-up her brightest sky, She wavers 'midst her doubts, and learns to heave a sigh. VII But, lo! the sun now seeks the west, And, see, the distant landscape dies! And now, with anxious cares oppress'd, I view yon dome arise! Ah! soon, too soon, I give the faint adieu, And sleeps my song, as fades the cheerful day; Soon shall the dusky city bound my view, And hag ey'd Spleen November's call obey. Ye fields, ye groves, whose every charm could please; Ye gentle friends, adieu, and, farewell, rural ease. VIII Yet field, and grove, and gentle friend, When Memory bids, shall re-appear; Quick, where she lifts her wand, ascend The long-departed year: The choirs, whose warblings charm'd the youthful spring, And Summer's glittering tribes, and all that now Of Autumn fades, their mingled charms shall bring; And the full year 'mid Winter's reign shall glow; While Fancy, as the vision'd forms arise, Shall pencil woods and groves, and streams and purple skies. FROM ANACREON. Of Atreus' sons I wish to sing, To Cadmus fain would wake the string; But still in vain my fingers rove; The lyre will only sound to love. So now at length the chords I change, To give my lyre the boldest range; Yet, with Alcides brave and strong, And all his labours in my song, His name the strings will not rebound, Love lives, and breathes in every sound. So, farewell, heroes all, for me; Henceforth my Muse and I are free: And gaily now I sweep my string, For Love, and only Love, I sing. PERAMBULATORY MUSINGS, FROM BLENHBIM HOUSE, AT WOODSTOCK, IN OXFORDSHIRE, THE SEAT OF THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH, TO TITLEY HOUSE, IN HEREFORDSHIRE. Where Blenheim's turrets rise to view, And where, at length to nature true, Grave Vanbrugh, wearying long his head, Soften'd down his house of lead; And where, as bends the spacious dome, The rival arts of Greece and Rome Still live in Rysbrac's free design, And still in Rubens' colouring shine; Where Marlborough's valour, Marlborough's praise, The fair-wrought tapestry displays, 'Mid varying pleasures, thro' the day, Who might not linger life away? Or now, as spreads the fair domain O'er lake, or lawn, o'er hill or plain, Thro' woods, and groves, or vista clear, The crystal rivulet sparkling near, Still loitering, idly gay, along, Muse as inspir'd, the Sylvan song? How vain the wish! How quick the change! Thro' simpler scenes my footsteps range; Where nature smiles in peerless grace, And art but claims the second place; Scenes, trimm'd by Shenstone, neat and gay, Where Faunus' self might pipe all day: So simple, too, that not a swain But there might wake his rudest strain. Hail! Leasowes, now I climb thy hill; Now bless the babbling of each rill; Now wander down the friary glade; Till rous'd I hear the hoarse cascade, And glows again thro' every grove The soul of poesy and love: Then soft I sigh in pastoral strain, Nor dream of Bleinheim-house again. Sometimes sad, and sometimes gay, Like careless pilgrim still I stray, Till soon arriv'd at Hagley bower, I sigh to linger there an hour; Where Littleton in learned ease Polish'd his verse, and prun'd his trees; Where Pope, the tuneful groves among, Soft as at Twickenham, pour'd the song; And Thomson fix'd in colours clear The changeful Seasons of the year. Hail classic scenes! The willing muse Her flowers of many-mingling hues Might here entwine, and once again Hagley bloom forth in cheerful strain. Then, farewell, Shenstone's simpler scene; The rustic seat, the meadow green, Willows, that near the rivulet weep, The murmuring bees, the milk-white sheep. When Hagley's beauties rise to view, Yes! I could bid you all, adieu! Ever musing, ever ranging, Ever pleas'd, yet ever changing, Murmuring onward still I go, As brooks thro' winding vallies flow, That sparkle still, and still complain, That every rude restraint disdain, And gliding on some latent ore, Steal something not possess'd before; Then flow along in headlong haste, And babble o'er the ferny waste. Ah! then, does nature deck in vain The hill and vale, the grove, the plain? And can her curious hand supply Nothing to fix this vagrant eye? Shall art still vary, still improve, The winding walk, the tapering grove, And yet man's restless heart implore, With miser-mutterings, something more? Thus onward, slow I bend my way, Till soon to Titley-house I stray, And now delights me most of all The fair retreat of Titley-hall; Where near fair Eywood's seat is seen, And Oxford smiles, like Beauty's queen; Where Shobden's terrace glitters high, And varying mountains meet the sky. âBut when such numerous charms invite, Why most does Titley-house delight? âEliza there, melodious maid, Such measures to my ears convey'd, As had Cecilia been but near, Cecilia had not scorn'd to hear: Softly sad, or sweetly strong, She directs the varied song, To native scenes new charms can give, And bids the breathing canvas live; Or, as the sports and loves inspire, Wakes the soul-subduing lyre; Hence I welcom'd most of all The fair retreat of Titley-hall. Vocal groves and tuneful streams, Kindling wild poetic dreams, Where Dryad-nymphs are wont to stray, Or Naiads swim in wanton play: Mounts, that climb Jove's vaulted sky, While Ocean's God rolls thundering by; Vallies rich, and meadows fair, Touch'd with Flora's pencil rare, Rare, as when the nymph was led By Zephyrus to her bridal bed, (Then pencil'd did the fields appear, In all the glories of the year:) Widest glens, and deepest glades, Curving walks, and hoarse cascades, All, that Nature loves to impart, Or owns the plastic charm of art; All, that Fancy dares conceive, Or Fiction's various hand can weave; Allâmust cloy the sated eye, Till beauty's lovely form be nigh: Where woman walks, there seems to appear The Venus of the smiling year; Far from her, we feed on sighs, Tho' roving fields of Paradise. ODE ON LIBERTY. WRITTEN ON A PUBLIC ANNIVERSARY. Hall! more refulgent than the morning star, Parent of bliss, for whom the nations sigh, Thee, Liberty, I woo, and seem from far To mark the brightness of thy raptur'd eye; While, not to me unseemly, streams thy vest, Thy locks wild-dancing to the frolic wind; And, borne on flying feet, thou scorn'st to rest, Save where meek Truth near thee her seat may find; Soother of human life, blest Liberty! Still range thro' nature's walks, and I will range with thee. Say, dost thou love to climb the mountain's brow, Or haunt meandring stream, or laughing plain? Be mine with thee up mountain-heights to go, Or wake by river's brink the pastoral strain; Or tripping-light the flowery meads along, A simple swain, 'mid hinds and virgins gay, Pour forth to thee my merry evening song, Unwearied with the raptures of the day; And, when close-lock'd in Sleep's soft arms I lie, Still flattering dreams shall wake the midnight ecstasy. Or dost thou rather chuse to wear the veil Of mild Philosophy, and walk unseen, Serenely grave, along the cloister pale, Or in the grove, or glen, or shaven green? Oh! still be mine to tend thee on thy way;â Like thee to feel,âto glow with all thy flame, Gentle and clear, as the sun's smiling ray At dawn, yet warm, as his meridian beam, When wondering nations feel the piercing rays, And think they view their god, and kindle into praise. Such wast thou seen by Isis' silver flood, In converse sweet with Locke, immortal sage; Such too by Cam with him, whose bosom glow'd With thy pure raptures, and the Muse's rage; Nor less with him, who bore to distant climes His country's love, and o'er her miseries sigh'd; Brave injur'd patriot he, in evil times Who nobly liv'd, and not ignobly died: Who nobly liv'd, whose name shall ever live, While zeal in Britain glows, while freedom shall survive. But shouldst thou e'er from Britain speed thy way, On happier plains still linger with delight; And, while her patriots hail this sacred day, Oh! aid their counsels, and their battles fight: May tyrants ne'er, those murd'rers of the world, Austria's proud lord, and Prussia's faithless king, Their blood-stain'd banners to the air unfurl'd, O'er Freedom's sons the note of triumph sing: Still with the great resolve the Poles inspire, To live in thy embrace, or at thy feet expire. For me, should I grow thoughtless, and thy name Forget; should I wax cold, nor feel thy power; Then, too, may Fancy sleep, nor love of fame Uplift my soul beyond the passing hour. May beauty never smile upon my strain; May I be curs'd to live, some tyrant's tool, Whistle to his mean likings, and my gain Be this, to hear Ambition call me fool; Begin, and end, at Folly's call my lays, Dread the world's sneer, and truckle for it's praise. ODE ON SCIENCE. Iâ1. There are, who skim the stream of life, Who catch delight from every passing gale; Their ear no sounds of grief assail, They heed not nature's strife: Bright skies illume their dawn of day, While music wakes her magic powers; No clouds obstruct their noon-tide ray, And to soft measures move their evening hours: Gaily, Love's idle rovers, on they glide, And Pleasure, laughing Fair, the vessel deigns to guide. Iâ2. Their destin'd course some lonely bend, Where no propitious gales attend; And, hark! the note of woe from far, The frantic scream, the din of war: Struggling with storms, their mornings doubtful rise: Sullen and slow proceed their hours along: 'Mid scowling tempests close their evening skies, Nor soothes their ear the cheerful voice of song. Iâ3. But, lo! the sons of genius stand, And Science open spreads the volume fair; And Friendship waves her hand, To check the child of Mirth, to soothe the child of Care. Nature assumes her smiling form, Like Ocean resting from a storm: From distant India's pearly shores, From mystic Egypt's latent stores, To where in Grecia's tuneful groves The Graces wanton'd with the Loves, Lo! Science comes:âthe wilderness looks gay, And savage nature smiles, and rises into day. IIâ1. Deep in a vale, remote from noise, Long bloom'd the lovely Stranger, fond to trace The starry spheres, the world of soul, the grace Of mystic truth; her joys, And garment, simple: sages came;â They mark her eye, her even soul, The modest blush, the living flame, From inward light, that o'er her visage stole. âTo them 'twas given to deck the lovely Dame, In robes by Beauty wove, and lift her into fame. IIâ2. Saw you the sun dispensing light? Clouds soon have veil'd the glory bright. And thus, in Grecia's baneful hour, Beneath the misty frown of power, Science lay hid;âthen Goths and priests arose, And scatter blasts and mildews wide around; Till in the vale, where fruitful Arno flows, Fair Science smil'd again, as on Parnassian ground. IIâ3. Now see her rise serenely great, Dispensing golden blessings from on high, A sun, in more than royal state, Supreme she rules, amidst a cloudless sky: See Dulness close her eye of lead! See Superstition's reptiles dead! Sloth drag along her slimy way, And Ignorance retire from day! While Genius lifts his eye of fire, Beholds the light, and strikes his lyre: Views all around a new creation rise, Fields of perennial green, and fairer brighter skies. IIIâ1. The blooming wreath of rapturous praise Now weave with varied skill, and conscious pride, As when, near Pisa's laurell'd side, The Theban wove the bays. Of soul serene, and eye sublime, Immortal Science, hail! to thee, Bright with the precious spoils of time, We yield the crown, we bend the willing knee; To thee the Virtues all obedient rise, And Truth unveils her face, and looks with smiling eyes. IIIâ2. âYe sons of Mirth, and sons of Care, âSee me the bower of bliss prepare: âNear me descend ambrosial showers; âNear me shall bloom immortal flowers; âOh! hither, then, your erring courses bend; âSoon near my side shall Care forget to grieve; âHere Mirth's wild crew may haply find a friend; âAnd pining Melancholy dare to live!â IIIâ3. Thus Science spoke aloudâwhen, lo! By Fancy's eye was seen the sacred choir, That taught with vivid glow The canvas first to shine, that waked the melting lyre. And round and round their Queen they move, Symphonious to the voice of Love. Nor did in vain the thrilling dart Of Music pierce the captiv'd heart, Till every discord died away, As clouds before the solar ray. Thro' the wide earth th' harmonic chords resound; While Rapture lifts her voice, and Goodness smiles around. BOOK THE SECOND. TO AN EMINENT PAINTER. When the fond mother with a silent joy Surveys her lovely girl, or rosy boy; When the kind husband with soft-gazing eye, The face, that first awak'd the lover's sigh; When gentle friends, who feel the mutual flame, Dwell in warm transport on each other's name; Or nations hail the hero brave and just, And bless the statesman faithful to his trust; Say,âwhat the wish?âah wish how vain! That what once charm'd their eye, might charm again; The smile, the bloom, the rose's blushing dye, The awe-inspiring front, and dauntless eye, The nameless charm, that wak'd the young desire, Stirr'd the bold thought, or rous'd the soul of fire; That all might ever live, nor time derange Nature's fair workings with eternal change. Yes!âfondness hop'd in vain to trace The youthful lustre in a wrinkled face; And what the patriot's, hero's, statesman's lot? âTheir deeds recorded, but the face forgot. For, see! how Spring and Summer lead the year, And Autumn follows close, and Winter drear! How round the dial shadows steal away, For ever changing with the changing day! How on rude ocean, into tempest tost, Wave follows wave, and is for ever lost! So pass the years of man; thus swiftly fly The cheek light-smiling, and the sparkling eye, The blush of health, and Love's Ã¦therial light, With all the magic beamings of delight. The heats of manhood, foul Ambition's rage, And thirsty Grief, and slow-consuming Age; All something of the sap of life consume, Weaken the strength, and wither all the bloom: Hence sombre tints obscure, what smil'd before, Till love, and health, and beauty bloom no more. Till, as the rolling Ganges spreading wide, Buries the feeble Indian in his tide; Thus Death, in pity to the driv'ller's pains, Sweeps to th' oblivious grave his poor remains. Hail! Grecia, skill'd in art, that art divine, Which bade the human face again to shine; Made passion speak, and every feature live, And gave to Beauty all that Art could give; Say, what thy triumphs, when in living dye, Fair Helen roll'd again the melting eye! When Alexander's form again was seen, His haughty dignity, and royal mien! And all thy sages, bards, and heroes brave, Burst into life, as ransom'd from the grave! â, if sav'd at length from Party's rage, The deeds of heroes grace th' historic page; If sage Philosophy, and sacred Song, Plato's deep sense, and Homer's honey'd tongue; If Sculpture, such as Phidias' hand could raise, Command our wonder, and ensure our praise; Say, shall the Painter's art be less endear'd, Or, as more pleasing, be the less rever'd? Shall Zeuxis, who full many a glorious name Fix'd in the temple of ennobling Fame; Or, 'mid the task of each revolving day, Apelles living character pourtray, And yet themselves amid the vulgar throng Sleep, unrewarded with the wreath of song? The Muse forbadâshe knew the sister's part, (For colours fade beyond the reach of art), She saw, how time destroys what genius rears, Or fire devours at once the toil of years; Then, warm with zeal, she struck the living lyre, Nor let the Painter with his works expire. For see! the colours change; see time destroy, Once more, the lovely girl, the rosy boy, Love's purple light desert the languid eye, And Beauty's roseat colours quickly fly! See the stern hero lose his eye of fire, And all the sages rev'rend form retire! Though just proportion mark each flowing line, Though all the graces own the fair design, Yet from the canvas shall each charm depart: So strong is genius, and so frail is art! Where now the fruit, so swelling on the sight, That stopp'd the winged songster in his flight? The curtain, that with finish'd grace pourtray'd, All the rich subtleties of art convey'd? The trembling virgin, and her breast of snow, And the wild parent speechless in his woe? Th' unrivall'd fair, who, as of heavenly name, Warm'd every heart, and set the world on flame? The captiv'd maid, who foil'd the Painter's art, And fix'd her lovely picture on his heart? All, all, are fled! and as the Painter dies, So the bright colour from the canvas flies: Vanish'd each form; and every fair design Lives but in numbers, or adorns a coin. Hence should the sister-arts in union move, The same their honours, and the same their love; Each see, and feel, as though the Gods inspire, And give to mortals their immortal fire; Through air, and earth, and sea, together range, Mark Nature's steadiest forms, and wildest change; Extend to future days each glorious name, And, giving fame to others, challenge fame. And, while the Painter gives the feature strong, The Poet lifts the Painter in his song. Thus Waller sung in Charles's merry reign, And Vandyck's name adorn'd the courtly strain, With ready skill he trac'd the pencil'd face, And from the Painter stole poetic grace. And thus, enliven'd by the muse's ray, The critic-poet pour'd his laureat lay; And, as the royal hero rose to view, He sung the hero, and the painter too. His lyre the tuneful Pope to Jervas strung, And, as the painter felt, the poet sung. Each struck the chord, that rul'd the other's heart, Each seiz'd an image from the sister-art; Ev'n Dryden's prose shall Fresnoy's art prolong, And Mason make it live in British song. So, when I view beneath thy powerful art The speaking feature from the canvas start; When thy bold colouring spreads the shining hue, And gives some friend, as living, to the view, How could I hope,âas long shall be imprest His generous virtues on some kindred breast, So to his children might thy skill convey, âNor dread the silent stealth of slow decay,â His steady worthâthat curious when they scan The fair resemblance of the living man, Read in his face, amid the warmth of youth, The pride of honour, and the glow of truth; The kindred passion they within might feel, Glow with his friendship, catch his patriot zeal; And conscious, whence they caught the potent flame, Bless with an honest zeal his artist's name! For meâwell-pleas'd this wreath to thee I twine, Proud to enroll my humble name with thine. And should the verse but live beyond a day, Some youthful genius, kindling at the lay, Shall feel the proud desire like thee to please, Catch all thy force, and rival all thy ease, Ambitious 'mid the formost to excell, Yet taught, how hard the task, to pencil well. HOMER'S STATUE. FROM THE GREEK ANTHOLOGIA. Homer seem'd living brass, not destitute Of genius, and of mind; scarce unpossess'd Of voice ambrosial: so divine the skill, That e'en the brass appear'd a god in form. For scarcely can I think, that labouring hand Of mortal artist, station'd at his seat, Could shape that brass; but rather Pallas' self, Deep-counsell'd, fashion'd it: for she his form Well-knew: she the rich song of wisdom breath'd Through Homer, dwelling in his secret soul, Apollo's partner: then conspicuous stood My father, god-like Homer! Much he seem'd Some aged man; yet was that age most sweet, Distilling richer grace with beauty mix'd, Venerably sweet, that brighten'd all his form. Behind his bending neck a time-worn lock Flow'd from his hair, which from beside each ear Meandring stray'd: beneath extended wide His beard, which mellow curl'd, not to a point Tapering, but sloping broad, reflecting charms Upon his naked breast, and lovely face. Bald was his forehead: yet that forehead bald Shewed wisdom seated, counsellor of youth. Around his jutting eyebrows wandered art Considerate, nor in vain: for from his eyes Fled was the light: yet did he not appear Like a blind man: for on his sightless orbs Sat a sweet grace, which viewing, one might think, Art labour'd much, to make it seem to all, That from the secret fountain of his heart The bard sent up a stream of heavenly light. His cheeks were furrow'd o'er with wrinkling age, And somewhat hollowed, but upon them fat The Grace's partner, Modesty innate. The bee Pierian round his sacred mouth Stray'd wanton, big with honey-dropping sweets: In mutual embrace his hands were lock'd, Which, as when living, rested on a staff. His right ear list'ning seem'd, as though some muse, Or PhÅbus' lyre, were near; likening him to one With mind intensely fix'd; while here and there Genius, from inward light divergent, stray'd, Various and quick, weaving some war-like theme, Whose well-proportion'd harmonies might charm, Like Syren, warbling-soft Pierian airs. ON VISITING THE TOMB OF DAVID HUME, THE HISTORIAN, IN A BURYING GROUND AT EDINBURGH. There comes a season, when man's eye, disturb'd, Looks forth for nothing further, but appears Awhile to close; and, the reflecting mind Deep pondering on itself, forgets the world. Fair Spring, with all her pearls, and tints, and flowers, No longer charms, nor Summer's purple fruits Distilling nectar'd sweets, nor Autumn's crops Of glowing gold; nor Winter, with his frosts Mantling the mountain-tops, and binding, close, With freezing hand, waters, and glens, and groves. Beauteously grotesque, or wanton-wild, the scene Smiles vainly; for th' unconscious eye sees not In seeing, with no rapture swells the breast: Morning from saffron wing her airs perfum'd Scatters in vain, and wakes her minstrel bird, The tuneful lark, in vain; kind Heaven around Drops softest influence, and high Noon in vain Darts down her gaudiest ray: when Night ascends Her throne imperial, and bright hosts attend Of myriad constellations, man in vain Gazes; and walks a stranger through the world. For what may cheer the sight, when th' heart complains? He, Moralist, by Sorrow's softest touch Chastened and mellowed, like the golden ore In furnace melted, ponders on distress, Follies, and human frailties; forming thence The rules of patience, and the laws prescrib'd, On meek benevolence: manacling strong The raving passions: till the soul, sublim'd, And inly strengthen'd, grows serene and good. Such is the season, when near Avon's banks Bards weep at Shakspeare's tomb, with inward grief Sorrowing, that such, whose songs have charm'd the world, Lie silent down so quickly, like a harp Old, broken, useless, whence gay melodies The skilful minstrel never wakes again; Or like a weapon, by th' encrusted mould Close over-grown, and faded, till no more Tapers and shines the time-devoured steel. Such, too, the season, when from Calton Hill The travellers with quicken'd steps approach Death's silent mansion, where in long repose Together sleep philosopher and fool, Unenvying, undistinguish'd: there the sage With reverence pauses; there the silent tear Of sympathy lets fall, while on thy tomb Gazing, oh, Hume! laughter, and song, and wit, And idle babbling absent, much he sighs, And thinks, I too must die:âThro' the close breast A pleasing sadness steals: for, 'mid the crowd Of mortals dead, to ponder o'er the few Of frame more durable, who living rais'd Their fame's more lasting monument, and lest A legacy of deeds to times remote, Is sweet, even when the soul is sad, is sweet. And, such wast thou, sagacious moralist, Whose lessons shine not only in thy works, Thy life was moral: and may I condemn The man of searching mind, who systems weigh'd In judgment's nicer scale, and yielded not His weight of faith, when he durst not believe? Nor less with grace, and ease, and dignity Chasten'd, the historian shines, tho' not bestarr'd With fancies luminous:âyet does the page Spread a mild lustre round; nor shall the speck That lightly passes o'er, eclipse its beams. TO THE MEMORY OF GEORGE MORGAN. WRITTEN ON THE SEA-COAST. Thou lonesome shore, I hail thee! Not a star Illumes the skies, and not a sound is heard! Nature, as tho' to help mankind to think, Seems a short pause to hold:âno traveller Paces the beach; the only living thing, Scarce living, the poor shell-fish, that I tread, Buried in sand and stone, beneath my feet. 'Tis nightâthe time when real forms are still; When superstition walksâwhen she creates New eyes, new earsâand sees across the moor, Or on the lea, or by the church-yard path, Forms more or less than human, bloody or pale, Slow-pacing, or quick-flyingâshe can hear Foot-steps of terror, the loud clanking chain, Disturbing the repose, at dead of night, Of mansion, now untenanted; such forms, As shake a very hero; sounds that stir, In a saint's bosom, fear amid his prayers. And ocean's waves, unruffled by the wind, Sleep undisturb'dâand Fancy now might hear, Far, far away, the shriek of mariners, Faint, hopeless, lost; while the ship round and round Tost, bulges, and then plunges in the deep. But superstition here shall have no place, And fancy noneârealities demand A genuine strain: and could that strain but flow, As, Morgan, it should flow, not vainly then Should it return: then recollection strong Should be rekindled;âwhat thy brother was; âThe son, that could to age consoling give The lov'd attentions;âth' husband that outstript His partner's wishes;âthe benignant fire, His children's joy;âto thee another self, Kindest of brothers;âand mid friends a friend, Not of the vulgar and the narrow sort: Such should he liveâthe patriot should live; And, above all, the friend of human kind. His principle should live; his love of man Move in some breast, perhaps estrang'd before To the large passion, bath'd, as it might seem, Into his very spirit, 'till he rose A soul baptiz'd, a new created man. His was the pastor's lot:âand tho' he doff'd The shepherd-trim, yet could he not shift off, âNature had cloath'd him there,âthe pastor's heart. For social was his soul; and what he gain'd Of knowledge fair he freely would impart To all in friendliest converse, but to youth The most, as to the tenderest of the flock. The pastor, become tutor, now instill'd With science, principle, and love of truth, Ardour for liberty, the proud contempt Of power, and priest-craft, and the fondling wiles Links of the chain, that rivets human kind. And did he teach in vain? NoâMorganânoâ Love is a stirring principleâa seed, That silently works upward into life, Of flower and fruit most fragrant; and a soil, The breast of youth, where heaven delights to shed The richest influence, and to th' heart's root strikes. Oh! ye his children, when in distant years Ye bustle thro' a world, where slavery, pride, Avarice, ambition, and the abject routs Of worse than pagan deities are seen, Abominations, worshipp'd at highest noon, On altars deep distain'd with precious gore, With human victims,âtho' the cries are drown'd In the loud shouts of victory, and the bray Of triumph, and the din of midnight riot, And self admiring soothings; rites more curs'd, More filthy, hell-born, than were ever paid On Grecian shrines, or to that tyrant god Moloch, who erst by Rabba's fruitful vale Drank of the hell-cup mixt with parents tears;â Oh! when abominations, such as these, Crowd on your eyes, and ye may, chance, reflect On cities pillag'd, and on villages In flames, lands wide wasted, with the pride Of arts demolish'd, and of temples raz'd; Then say, and let self-rev'rence work within, âSuch gods were not the worship of my sire.â But, when ye see within the peaceful vale Industry bend, and independence link'd Closely behind her, Science, and the train Of smiling virtues, honour and truth, and love, The love of human kind: Oh! then revolve, Such was my father; then may move within The true ambition, the full soul of zeal, To emulate his worth; and on your breasts Striking, while sweet remembrance stirs within, Say, with an honest pride:ââHere sleeps my sire; âHere unforgotten lies an honest man.â And, Morgan, in this breast too he shall lie: And song shall tell his worth:ânor shall that song Seem mean, except there be who thought him mean. Verse hath its gaieties: nor think it vain, If sometimes, to give life to languid hours, Or a new zest to pleasure, it may choose To sing of loves, and mirths, and sports, and smiles. For verse is often made by skilful hands The heart's restorative, and often tips Love with gay wings, and makes him fly at large Free as the air, and oft on vagrant hearts Slips the light chain of matrimonial bonds. Verse hath, too, nobler services; to sound The triumphs fair of Freedom, to record The patriot virtues, honour, justice, truth, Benevolence; nor is less fond to strew, When worth departs, the flow'ret on its grave, Blooming, tho' humble, speaking to the world, âThat virtue should not die:â such, Morgan, take A friend's poor tribute to thy brother's name. ON THE DEATH OF GILBERT WAKEFIELD. MEDITATED IN A GARDEN, NEAR A CHURCH-YARD, AT THE CLOSE OF AUTUMN. Oh! rural walk! Thy stillness now how sweet, Thy stillness and thy gloom, as erst thy song, Thy morning-smile, and flower!âfrom sickness now I come, to count the sum of human life, A sum how small! to muse its many ills, Its frailties, follies, numerous; and I come, To muse on death;âfor Wakefield is no more. And is he then no more? The man so full Of schemes, of learn'd resolves, so prompt and quick To execute, with temperance who had form'd So close alliance, that, methought, he seem'd Destin'd to live, the cool grey chronicler Of years now passing, and of years to pass Some thirty years to come;âthe gen'rous friend,â Is he no more? Farewell, then, world, awhile;â And thou shalt be my cloister, rural shade. No mountain scene is near, to lift the gaze To gaudy prospects; no resplendent curl Of falling cataract; no resounding noise Of ocean, to inspire majestic thought, Or language deep and strong; no poplar shade, No myrtle grove, no softly-flowing stream, With willow crown'd, to sooth a lover's breast. Time is, such things shall pleaseâsweet rural walk, Thee now I seek: nor less, tho' church-yard near Gives the memento, that life's cultur'd walk Conducts but to the grave; and that I hear The clock give notice, Time is on the wing, And the full-tolling bell, that seems to say âThere fled from one the whole of passing time.â Now closes Autumnâand, oh season calm! Thou shalt instruct me,âthou to man canst act, And well canst act, the moralizer's part;â Thou art a page in nature's volume fair, And wise thy lesson, and thy language plain, And well-enforc'd, and strong;âthou art all truth. Impressive monitor, I bend to thee Submissive; to thy lesson grave and sage Will be all eye, all ear;âfor tho' I see No blossom peeping on the smiling year; Nor flow'r to greet me; nor the melting voice Of nightingale, nor shining fruit t' allure My taste; yet, closing Autumn, shall thy leaf Yellow, and wrinkled, preach close to my heart. Methinks, it says, ah! what art thou, O man? A falling withering leafâand such thy friend. He had his Springâhis Summerâscarcely he saw His Autumnâfor as yet he had not pass'd His glowing time of life; unless, perchance, Our life is Autumn all; for in the midst Of life we are in death, and while man seems Smiling in years, falls like yon falling leaf. Oh! well do I remember, years ago, That I did wander, tho' long train'd to thought, Still too, too thoughtless, near thy stream, oh Cam! There first I saw the friend that now I mourn. For near thy stream, he, too, was wont to crop The flowers of learningâI remember wellâ Beneath his garb, the trappings of the schools, I saw a form erect and slender, like T' one early form'd to manliness of thought And rigid duties: o'er his visage pale Fair Science beam'd; and quick around his eye A critic archness play'd, that would have seem'd On sternness bent and querulousness, but that A gentleness was there, that still appear'd To check some frowardness, which while it oft Obtruded its dislikes, yet did not seem From the pure fountain of his heart to rise. His gait was steady, firm; for much he seem'd As he but walk'd, to gather in his mind Thoughts, that had stray'd, or to digest with care The feastings of his soul in bookish hours. I knew him not; at least, I did not know The friend;âI only knew of worth and wit, The zeal of industry, the love of fame, Of virtue, science, and they call'd them, Wakefield. This was his Spring of life, when hopes were gay, And wishes blooming, not of honours high, Or in the world, or in the churches mart, But to secure the crown of well-earn'd praise, Of genius, and of learning:âand he did Obtain the well earn'd wreathe, which well was worn Thro' life, and with advancing years still grew. But, in the Summer of his life I knew him, And call'd him friend: for in our hearts did dwell Some kindred likings and some kindred scorns: The tyrant's state, the pontiff's pomp and pride, The hireling's meanness; the debasing tricks Of avarice; the sycophantic airs Of danglers after wealth: ah! subjects fit Of generous scorn: together we did hail The star of Freedom, rising on a world Of slavery-goaded men: we liv'd to see France rise to something of the new-born man, Snapping her fetters off, enlarg'd and free. Oh! had he liv'd to hail this day of Peace, It should have wak'd some ardent, generous thoughts, Some rapturous feelings, some exulting notes, And he had triumph'd in his prison-house. His prison-house! He had no prison-house: Worth, freedom, wisdom, still can walk at large, Tho' bolts, and bars, and walls of adamant, May intervene: the sun's Ã¦thereal beam, The lightest breeze, the voice of wife, of child, And friend, and, chiefest, conscience, light within, Cheer the brave man retir'd; while mind upsoars Thro' worlds on worlds, beyond the reach of fear. But I have wander'd: let me then recount The sum of life, and prosit by th' amount: A little learning, and a little weakness; A little pleasure, and enough of pain: A little freedom, with its tale of slavery; Passions and reasons struggle; where, tho' oft Reason claims empire, passion governs still; Believing much, yet doubting not a little; Till sickness comes, and with it gloom of thought;â When man, quite wearied with a world, perhaps, Not moving to his mind, a foolish world, Seeks inward stillness, and lies quiet down. MONODY. ON THE DEATH OF ROBERT ROBINSON. I âWarm'd by the glowing year, âAwake to life, harmonious strings; âStill rise, my song, in numbers soft and clear, âFor still the garden smiles, the groves with wild-notes ring.â In Hammond's bower, at ease reclin'd, Thus I reliev'd my weary mind; 'Till thought was free, and fancy gay, And friendship listen'd to the lay. But what avail the flowers of song? Must I thus drop th' unsinish'd wreath? Or scatter it the tombs among, To wither near the realms of death? Ye flowery tribes, and vernal song, adieu; A mourner sad I go, to court the baleful yew. II Again, thou yew tree's shade, Again receive your trembling guest. Ye regions, where repose the hallow'd dead, Find me some secret charm, to heal this aching breast. Thro' garden, skies, and grove, In vain should Fancy rove, When dead appears the rose's bloom, Faint all the myrtle's rich perfume, And faint thy beams, oh! sacred light! Ah! dearer now the church yard's gloom, Where the pale empress of the night Silvers, serene, the moss-grown tomb. There fond to muse, in thought I now will stray; For there my Theron sleeps, and I will bless his clay. III As in the lonely vale The modest primrose droops and dies, Or near the pathless hedge the violet pale, So gentle Theron droop'd, so breath'd his dying sighs. No daughter's tender aid was near; No children dropp'd the fervid tear; No wife receiv'd the last request; No friend the dying eye-lid press'd. 'Mid the deep silence of the night, Softly the genial heats retire; And quickly close his orbs of sight, Like lamps, that suddenly expire: Oh! wishes, that but flatter, to deceive: Ah! prayers, that nourish hope, yet leave but cause to grieve. IV High on the topmost boughs Of Virtue's ever-blooming tree, A flower, of rich ambrosial fragrance, blows, Ah! never reach'd by Pride, fair Charity. Higher and higher may I soar, Climb the blest tree, and crop the flower; And plant it deep within this breast, To blossom there, a sacred guest: The simple sweets should cheer me more, When hopes decline, and grief invades, Than could Arabia's copious store, Or rich Italian shades. If ever mortal cropp'd that hallow'd tree, My Theron, it was cropp'd, thou kindest friend, by thee. V Among the village-youth The generous Theron lov'd to rove; To them he strew'd the honey'd gems of truth, With all the patriot's zeal, with all the pastor's love. Yet could his fancy's various powers, Yet could his learning's fruitful stores, And all his melody of tongue, Charm wisdom's more enlighten'd throng. Age ceas'd lost pleasures to bewail; Contentment smil'd at poverty; Labour would welcome pain, and hail The orient sun of liberty: âStill let me toil, still not inglorious toil, âIn Britain's happy plains, in Freedom's favourite isle. VI But, say, has Heaven in vain The generous breast with freedom fir'd? Shall friendship hopeless round their tombs complain, Whom love of honest fame, and virtuous zeal inspir'd? Ah! no: their honour'd names are blest; In peace their sacred ashes rest: And oft the grateful bard shall stray, To sing their worth, to bless their clay. For brighter still their names shall rise, Tho' time a restless course pursue, Thro' fairer fields and purer skies, And steady lustre shew. Still in their works they live, and live to shine, Like stars of human kind, a long illustrious line. A NIGHT THOUGHT: WRITTEN IN A TIME OF AFFLICTION, IN EMANUEL COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, ON A VISIT, AFTER SOME YEARS ABSENCE. I As some lone redbreast, shivering from the storm, Forsakes the precincts of the leafless grove, And, while bleak winter nature's face deforms, Still finds a shelter in some neat alcove: II Thus I, still travelling thro' this vale of tears, And not unoft beset with tempests rude, Here rest my weary steps, and hush my fears, Wrapt in thy sacred haunt, blest solitude. III Ye walls, (for ye have witness'd oft my prayer) Oh once again receive a transient guest! A wanderer oft, and now the child of care, Here let him steal a momentary-rest. IV Studious of truth, I sought your mild abode; And wander'd still, tho' studious, far away: Ah! could I think, as yet untaught, the road So thorny was, that fancy painted gay? V Rich as the stream o'er thirsty Egypt pours, Soft as the breeze o'er Libya's parched plain, To me so rich are memory's fruitful stores, Thus soft to me the Muse's plaintive strain. VI Remembrance brings to view the polish'd friend, My youth's sweet pride, the patron of my song; With grateful love at Askew's name I bend; One hallow'd strain to Askew's name prolong. VII And long as reason holds its faithful seat, Eliza's worth shall dwell within this breast; Wisdom and beauty in Eliza met; Deep on this heart her image lies impress'd. VIIII At Hope's vain dream how smil'd insidious death! Ah! forms that live in wayward Fancy's eye! Or hang but on a mortal's fleeting breath, And with that mortal doom'd, ah! soon to die. IX But say, is Hope thus doom'd through life to dream? Is Fancy, though a gay, yet faithless guide? False as yon orb, reflected from the stream, Light as the meteors, that thro' Ã¦ther glide? X Noâlet Reflection try her native force; Her aid let sage Experience duly lend; So shall meek Patience smooth life's downward course, And stern Affliction prove a faithful friend. XI Fair nature's volume, legible and plain, Its ample page unfolds to all mankind; Read by the sage, though often read in vain, Read by the savage, deem'd by sages blind. XII The breeze, tho' light, that whispers thro' the dale, The flower, tho' mean, that drinks the pearly dew, The smallest insect, floating on the gale, Give to their grief-worn cheek a brighter hue. XIII Yet are there, whom delights not Nature's green, Nor sooths the melting songster's sweetest lay: Mourners there are, who love the midnight scene, And, like the night-bird, shun the face of day: XIV There are, who love the gothic aisle to tread, The dark grove frowning round the hermit's stall, The cloister'd pile, where sleep the noble dead, And heroes bleed upon th' escutcheon'd wall. XV Nor dare, ye tribes, that frolic gay at noon, Nor ye, who grieve in state, their woes deride; E'en the hoarse night-bird screaming to the moon, More sooths, than Folly's noise, or Folly's pride. XVI Nor vainly twinkle those fair orbs of light; Nor vainly does yon moon's mild glory shine; Nor the still waters shew the face of night: Ah! scene, how well allied to cares like mine! XVII And e'en around this solitary room, Kind visitant, to cheer my midnight song, The same fair moon throws no unpleasing gloom, Spreading athwart its shadows dark and long. XVIII For not alone complaining Love shall find The magic stillness of the midnight scene; Sorrows, if such there be, of heavier kind, Lose their severer form, and grow serene. XIX Ah! think not Fate will only bliss bestow; Pleasure and pain compose the motley plan: Oh! may I learn to melt at human woe, By knowing, what it is to feel like man! XX âTo talk of truth, and miss it: to complain; âTo toil and pant for fame; with love to sigh; âTo count that loss, which once was reckon'd gain;â âThen to grow weary, turn aside, and die.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. BOOK THE THIRD. THE LOVE-POET. Oh! Love, fair Nature's child, undeck'd by art, Whom should I call, but thee, in every clime, The poet's mighty god? Harmonious power! To whom all beings raise Gay songs, and gratulations meet, For thine it is thro' air, earth, sea to range, Wing'd with desire, and warm with life; Thine the perennial fires, that renovate the world! Have I not on thy altars duly pour'd The pure libation, following it with sighs, And resignation meet? To thee have I not paid, at morn and eve, The pray'r too big for words, a priest, That greatly felt, and silently ador'd? Oh! then thy vot'ry's trembling heart Touch with the living coals, that on thine altar burn. But spare, oh! spare me now: assume no more The form terrific, fire-red eyes and darts, Thy darts of living steel; Nor bring with thee thy train of thousand ills, The sleepless night, the day of care, Follies, and wanderings, griefs, and fear and smarts, Pale melancholy, pining shame, That lead the vagrant heart to lab'rinths of despair. Be but my muse,âwhat other shall I need? Give me but that sweet music of the soul, Can I then want a lyre? Oh! tune my heart-strings;âso the passions all Shall to my song sing jubilant: So shall the seasons, in alternate dance, Pass smiling by, each herb, fruit, flow'r, Be redolent of sweets, and every gale inspire! True to thy name, now wear thy loveliest form, Dimples and smiles, and pity-beaming eyes, And soul-enliven'd mirths. And bring the flower of bliss without the thorn; Delights that last, and cares that please, With meek benevolence, but taught by thee: So from my heart, by thee attun'd, Sweet melodies shall rise, and dignify my song. THE MUSES' WEDDING-DAY. Let doctors prattle what they will;â I laugh at what they say;â Muse, 'tis our wedding day; We will be merry; so a bumper fill. Yes! let the glass Now freely pass; We have had ills enough, now is our time for play. Here's to the bards of earliest times, And may the laurel bough Still flourish on their brow, As still they lift our souls with loftiest rhymes. So let the glass Now freely pass; Still be their mem'ries green as thousand years ago. Here's to the bard of modern days, May duns ne'er vex his door, As they have bards' before; Health to his Love, and lucky be his lays! So let the glass Now freely pass; May he have wit at will, of money too good store! Here's to the bards of years to come, And when they feel within The tuneful fit begin, And Wit grow warm, may Prudence not leave home! So let the glass, Now freely pass, Lest Poverty should come, that beldame lank and thin. Here's to the muses, more than nine, For know, that Ladies fair The best of muses are, And can do more, than e'en the god of wine. So let the glass Now freely pass, Love is the poet's friend, and love is most divine. Here's to all patrons good and kind, I mean not every sinner, Who gives the bard a dinner, And who with dirty work would clog his mind. But let the glass Now freely pass, To him, who loves the Muse, and can by goodness bind. Here's to the souls, that I love most, I mean to each bookseller, Who is a right good fellow, Who need not tremble at an author's ghost; So lift the glass And let it pass, Muse, I could drink their healths, till I grew warm and mellow. But we must raise us to the nonce: Shall I be now the tool Of old Sir William's school? Noânoâwe surely may get drunk for once. So move the glass And let it pass: Who on their wedding-day would ever drink by rule? Thus, Muse, with us the matter stands;â Tho' we are wedded, And we have bedded, Yet never priest did join the holy bands. But move the glass And let it pass;â So may our freaks and loves still live in fairy lands! BÃRGER, OR, WINTER DEFEATED. See! where stern Winter's icy hand Disrobes the poplar tree! The fields, their May-clothes lost, all naked stand. Their forms of red, white, blue, no more I see, Buried in snows they sleep, and live no more for me. Yet flowrets sweet, shall I for you The song of grief indite, When I my lovely loving charmer view, In more than all your vernal beauty bright, With forehead white, red lip, and eyes of azure light? Ye blackbirds, that once cheer'd the vale, Ye nightingales, that charm'd the grove, How vainly should your notes my ear assail, For silver-voic'd is she, the girl I love, And sweet her breath, as gales o'er hyacinth bed that rove. When of her lips I taste the bliss, Full happiness I seem to meet; More dear to me the honey-breathing kiss, Than mulberry fragrant, or than cherry sweet: What more then can I ask, in her fair spring I greet? KING WILLIAM'S MAN, OR, THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVOLUTION. As when the sun's bright beams appear, And lowering tempests steal away, So midst a dark revolving year, Returns this bright auspicious day. Britons, revive, lift high the glee, And hail the day with three times three. Three cheers, our sacred country's due, We raise for popish plots reveal'd. Thus perish Superstition's crew, Tho' deep as hell, they lie conceal'd! Britons, &amp;c. Three more to Freedom's name we give, And shout to see a tyrant fly; Long may Britannia's saviours live, Her tyrants all inglorious die! Britons, &amp;c. Three times we shout for equal laws, And in a virtuous jury boast; May justice and the people's cause, Reign ev'ry loyal Briton's toast! Britons, &amp;c. Roll on, ye years, and days succeed, That shall to tyrants ruin bring! Europe shall ratify the deed, And joyful nations shout and sing, And Britons wake their gayest glee, And hail that day with three times three. DEMOCRITUS JUNIOR; OR, THE LAUGHING PHILOSOPHER. Tho' life declines, and time the thief, Has stol'n my bloom away; I charge thee, fly these cheerful haunts, dull grief, Nor, think tho' shine my locks all silver-grey, That I, like dotard old, will fall thy sickly prey. Light was my heart, when life was young, As kid o'er verdant plain, I laugh'd, and danc'd, I snigger'd, toy'd and sung: The lads and lasses join'd my gamesome strain; And age stood smirking by us growing young again. Where are those hours? They are not fled; My comrades live, and still Old bald-pates oft we meet, by custom led; We call up school-boy days with wizard skill, Repeat our merry pranks, and then a bumper fill. Why startle at the sparkling glass? Quaff'd not old Noah wine? Wise Solomonâdid he not toast his lass? Nor did, tho' grey their beards, their joys decline; But Laughter was their god, and Laughter shall be mine. Ye men, who worship hoards of gold, Yet pleasure dare not taste, Can I but laugh such men-moles to behold, Or such as riches only know to waste, Mere squirrels cracking nuts, and squandering them in haste? Philosophers, who wink and blink With close-glass'd peeping eyes, Can I but laugh, profoundest sirs, to think, What pride mid those meek looks in ambush lies? How Folly screens her face mid Wisdom's fair disguise? Ye magpie poets, chattering rhymes, And ye, who strains of woe, Like whining ring-doves, eke against the times, Magging your saucy clack at all ye know, Or soothing poor dear selves in numbers sadly slow? Whether, good sirs, ye rail or pine, What boots it all to me? To sit, and prate, like mock-bird, shall be mine, To chatter, 'plain like you, then off I'll flee; And jeer you all at once, in one high laughing glee. Ye patriot souls, so wond'rous grave, So loving, good, and wise, Boasting your country ye but wish to save,â Ye lanky spiders, snaring silly flies;â Oh! how I sit and laugh, to trace your silken lies. But queens, and kings, and such like things, I rev'rence much; and never, No, never will I laugh at queens or kings; But crowns from red caps, faith, I cannot sever; And I could laugh at both, for ever and for ever. And while I laugh, good Joan, my wife, Shall sport like damsel gay; For Joan, kind soul, has laugh'd with me thro' life; And still, like two old lutes, in tune we play; And while our hearts are blithe, ne'er dream of life's decay. Thus, Falstaff-like, I'll live and die, Laugh long as I can see; And, when Death's busy hand shall close my eyes, This bag of jokes I leave-the doctor's fee. Then, Doctor, when I'm dead, laugh thou, and think of me. TIMON; OR, THE MAN-HATER. Ye comrades, who, when life was young, When Hope was warm, and Fancy gay, How are ye fled, ye fluttering throng, Mere insects of a summer's day! False world, I now defy thy frown; Friendship, I court no more thy smile! This heart, now dead, or senseless grown, Where could ye torture, how beguile? Ye books, that cheer'd my lonesome hours, Ye songs, that charm'd a lover's breast, Fled, fled is all your boasted powerâ Talk ye,âye once could talk,âof rest? Deceitful books, that preach of truth, Your folemn lectures all are lies: Ye songs, that could beguile my youth, Can ye relieve a heart, that sighs? Oh! sun, why sparkle bright thy beams? Thy marching, why so stately-slow? Quick-fly, as glides the mountain-stream;â Why linger thus o'er tents of woe? Ye lightnings, flash your sires along; Ye heav'ns, assume your deadliest form; Ye thunders, mutter deep, and strong, And let me perish in the storm. Or, if some gods preside above, Oh! bear me far from human race; Wild 'mid some desart let me rove, And view no smiling fellow face. Or, on some mountain's side of rock, Where stray the wild sheep, whistling near, I'll sit like straggler from the flock, And surly view the prospect drear. And, when grey ev'ning's mists arise, Some lonely ghost shall be my guest, Whose body now unburied lies, Who sighs, like me, in vain for rest. Oh! Nature, by what art combin'd, Didst thou contrive thy monstrous plan? I loathe my fellows of mankind; I hate myself for being man. THE VOLUNTEER TO THE TRUE PATRIOT. While venal bards attempt to sound Thro' years remote the trump of fame, And call the wondering nations round, To learn some haughty conqu'ror's name, Justice demands a purer song, Let Freedom's sons the strain prolong. Let such receive their country's praise, Who Virtue's cause undaunted plead; And such the Poet's unbought lays, Who dare in Freedom's cause to bleed. Justice, &amp;c. And live there in degenerate times Men still to public virtue true, Who, blushing for a nation's crimes, Still fearless give the honour due? Justice, &amp;c. Yes: should a nation prove unjust, Nor laurels deck the patriot's head; Genius shall shape the living bust, And future bards his glory spread. Justice, &amp;c. Justice shall far extend her reign, And Freedom wave her banners wide; And those immortal honours gain, Who nobly liv'd, or nobly died. Justice, &amp;c. THE SYMPATHIST; WRITTEN IN AN ALCOVE, AT NOON, ON A VERY SULTRY DAY. Oh! Thou, whose early-beaming smile, Whose parting blushes gild the sky, And warm with purest fires the tuneful tribes! As glows that flower of stately form, Whose hue of gold to thee unfolds; So at the tender smile of morn, So 'mid the sober blush of Eve, To thee, fair sun, I turn, and bless thy cheering beam. But now no moreâthe noontide ray Has taught the herd to court the shadeâ And cheat in social crowds the sullen hours. Now labour seeks a short repose; And Love, that oft, at evening mild, Soft-whispers in the virgin's ear His tender tale, with many a sigh, Flags his young wing, and feverish drops his dart. Me too, this shady, cool alcove, Me this embowering oak invites, To sit at ease, and sing the hours away. Here let me woo the moral muse: Her voice may suit the noon of life, Which nor the virgin eye of morn, Shall cheer again, nor the soft hand Of matron eve may lead to peaceful bowers. Ah! now I feel the blaze of day, That scorches, while it shines; I hear Life's busy hum, rude war and party rage; The sun darts downward on this head, His course direct, nor mild his beams. The world moves restless, and, at home, Folly has gorg'd herself with crimes, And I was born to see, to feel, to mourn. But, let not private malice boast;â This breast heeds not her little sting; Her little sting wounds not the generous breast: But there's a public monster, gorg'd With blood of virtuous men, and her sting Knows where to pierce a nation; her I dread, her barbed dart I dread, That, thro' a thousand victims, pierces me. Here, then, I hail retreat, and shade: Here taste the sweets of blest repose; Tho', as yon silent songstress hangs the wing, And seems to grudge th' autumnal year Her song of mellowed harmonies; So droops my voice, and sleeps my song; So nursing fear, and sympathies of soul, Sorrowing I sit, and languish at the sun. Anno 1794. THE PLAINTIVE MAN'S ADDRESS TO MELANCHOLY. I Oh! nymph of pallid hue, and raven hair, That in sequester'd scenes art wont to rest, Deep-nurturing some grief within thy breast, Some weight of grief, that none with thee may share; Whose eye, whence tears have long forgot to flow, To Heaven directed looks, of earth afraid: How dear to me thy form of speechless woe! And sacred are thy haunts, thou solitary maid! II Oft art thou seen beside the willowy stream; And, though no youthful smile adorns thy face, Though on thy cheek no roses we may trace, Yet dost thou, in thy spring of life, some virgin seem. Thy vesture careless hangs, as snowdrop white; Loose-floating fall thy locks, unbound thy zone; Thine eye now softly sad, now wildly bright, Bespeaks a lover dead, and thou wilt love but one. III Now art thou seen slow-lingering in the wood, Where pours the nightingale her liquid throat, And varies through the night her love-lorn note, As tho' her mate were fled, or tender brood.â To thee more pleasing then the vestment grey, Pale mourner! saddest of the widow-train, Doom'd to lament, at thy dark close of day, Some aged Priam deadâsome youthful Hector slain. IV Thee, Fancy, sometimes hails the Muse of Woe, Whom fabled wrongs can wake to real smart; Ovid's soft fictions make thee melt at heart; And suffering ghosts instruct the tear to flow. Does tender sorrow Pity's Bard inspire? Thy lute responsive breathes the tragic moan: But, does Orestes curse the God of fire? Quick dost thou leave thy lute, to listen to his groan. V Say, can that pensive look thy mind reveal, While from thy lips th' unfinished accents fall, As tho' the forward tongue would utter all, Which yet thy secret bosom would conceal? Witness to wrongs, no pity can relieve, To joys, which flatter, but must shortly flee; E'en fancied Misery wakes the cause to grieve: Thou haft a sigh for all; none heaves a sigh for thee! VI Then haste thee, Queen of Woe, from mortal eye; Thy mansion fix within some lonely cell, Where pale-ey'd Superstition loves to dwell, Wearied of life, and lingers but to die: As the sand streams to mark the fleeting hour; As the death's-head reminds thee of thy doom; As the spade sinks thy future grave bed lower, I, too, will learn to die, sad pilgrim at thy tomb! VII For, oh! whatever form I see thee wear, If yet soft Mercy dwell within thy breast; Thyself so sad, yet anxious to make blest, For others woe, if thou the sigh wilt spare; Tho' like the sage that only liv'd to weep; Tho' all the load of human ills were thine, For thee will I forego the balmy sleep, Or, wandering wild like thee, will make thy sorrows mine. THE CITIZEN OF THE WORLD. When long thick tempests waste the plains, And lightnings cleave an angry sky, Sorrow invades each anxious swain, And trembling nymphs to shelter fly. But should the sun's bright beams appear, Hush'd are their sighs, and calm'd their fear. So, when fierce zeal a nation rends, And dark injustice veils the throne, Beneath the storm meek virtue bends, And modest truth is heard to groan: But let the star of Freedom rise, They hail the beams with grateful eyes. Who, then, when patriots long oppress'd, Decree to curb a tyrant's pride, And justice fires a nation's breast, Who shall the gen'rous ardour chide? What shall withstand the great decree, When a brave nation will be free? Thus Greece repell'd her num'rous foes Thus Britain curb'd a Stuart's race; Thus Gallia's sons to glory rose, Heralds of Peace to future days: And thus may all the nations rise, And shout their triumphs to the skies! The wars of ages thus decided, Commerce shall bless each smiling land; And man from man no more divided, In peace shall live, a friendly band. But, tyrants with their glare of pow'r, Like meteors fall, to rise no more. Then blooming youths, and sages hoary, Shall sing the deeds of ancient days, And tender virgins learn the story, And children lisp their grandsires praise. The heavens shall smile, and earth be gay, When Peace with Freedom rules the day. THE SAILOR THE SCENE, SCOTLAND. My dame, behold a sailor brave! And he must quickly plough the sea; Must leave, for ocean's boist'rous wave, The rippling brook, and whispering tree. The blackbird calls; the skylarks ring Shrill carols thro' the welkin clear; Nature's full chorus seems to sing, âStill, happy sailor, linger here.â But, Dame, you view a sailor brave; And he must plough the boist'rous wave. Yon dainty palace charms my eye, And Avon's waters sweetly glide, Fair Bircleugh's flowery terrace nigh, Hast'ning to meet the bonny Clyde: Ah! pleasing scene!âin rapt'rous mood, How near thy braes I still could stray! How range yon deep romantic wood, And talk of love the live-long day! But, Dame, &amp;c. As dew-drop Peggy's eye is bright, Your Peggy's cheek as lily fair, Her feet, as hare's, move soft and light, Her voice like blackbird's loud and clear. And she can soften every heart, When fond she sings her âHighland Laddie;â So quickly, Dame, must I depart, And keep my heart still tight and steady. But, Dame, &amp;c. But, when on ocean's restless bed, The ship rolls rocking to the wind, When shores and cliffs, and hills are fled, Thy kindness will I call to mind. When dowie droops my head with grief, And from my eye-lid steals a tear, In grateful thoughts I'll find relief, And Peggy's song my heart shall cheer. But, Dame, you view a sailor brave, And now he hastes to plough the wave. HORACE. Why, when I view those cherry lips, That breast of sweets, those eyes of fire, While Fancy from thy mouth rich nectar sips, And round thy neck entwines each young desire? Why should I ask, if twenty years, Or twenty more matur'd those charms, Thy breath, more soft than spring, thy lover cheers, And more than summer lingers in thy arms. The Muse for thee is proud to sing, The Graces lead the dance to thee, The Nymphs to thee their sweetest flowrets bring: Oh! then it surely cannot winter be. What tho' the bloom of years were fled, The heats of love all pass'd away? Yet wisdom could on age new lustre shed, As a sweet glory gilds the parting day. THE ADDRESS OF A POOR PRIVATE, WITH HIS FAMILY, WHILE PUBLIC MEN WERE ENGAGED IN A FAST. Great Framer of unnumber'd worlds, And whom unnumber'd worlds adore; Whose goodness all thy creatures share, While Nature trembles at thy power: Thine is the hand that moves the spheres, That wakes the winds, and lifts the sea, And man, who moves the lord of earth, Acts but the part assign'd by thee. Kings, at whose will a nation bends, Bow at thy throne, and own thy sway, And, tho' like gods they tread on earth, To thee the duteous service pay. Chiefs, tho' with numerous hosts combin'd, They fellow-blood in torrents spill, Eager for conquest and for fame, Do but thy great designs fulfill. While suppliant crowds implore thy aid, To thee we raise the humble cry, Thine altar is the contrite heart, Thine incense a repentant sigh. But, if injustice grind the poor, Or avarice stain the sordid hand; Or fierce ambition thirst for blood, Or rude oppression waste the land; The God, who hears the orphan's cry, The widow's pray'r, the prisoner's groan, Still list'ning to the poor opprest, Shall spurn th' oppressor from his throne. Nor will he heed the lifted eye, The suppliant hand, the bending knee, Nor altars grac'd with splendid rites, The forms of public mockery. Oh! Britain, in thy sober hour, Learn justice, nor contemn the rod! So will he love to be thy friend, If thus thou own him, as thy God. SIMONIDES. A TRANSLATION FROM THE GREEK. When on the motley-painted chest the wind Blew boistrous, and by dire commotions stirr'd, The rising surges roar'd, Fair Danae, while trickled down her cheek The frequent tear, felt all a mother's pangs; Round her young Perseus, round her dearest babe, She threw, resign'd to fate, her lovely arm, And breath'd, thus softly breath'd, the sorrows of her soul. Ah! me, my child, what griefs do I endure! Whilst thou, dear suckling babe, ill-omen'd child, Sleepest, with heart at rest; Sleepest in joyless, brass-encircled house; And dark the night, tho' gleams the moon serene. The wave, that passes thy unmoisten'd locks, Thou heedest not; thou hearest not the winds; For calm is thy lov'd face, in purple vestment veil'd. Ills now press on; and, didst thou know those ills, How wouldst thou to my words, my words of woe, Lend me thy little ear! Sleep, then, my babe, thy mother bids thee sleep; And sleep the waves, and sleep my sea of cares. Yet, oh! my father Jove, confound their schemes! Bold now the prayerâoh! may my Perseus live! Still may he live, and still revenge his mother's wrongs. SAPPHO; OR, THE RESOLVE. Yes, I have lov'd: yet often have I said, Love in this breast shall never revel more; But I will listen to wild ocean's roar, Or, like some out-cast solitary shade, Will cling upon the howlings of the wind, Till I grow deaf and lifeless, cold and blind. But, ah! enchantress, cease the tender lay, Nor tune thy lyre to notes, thus softly slow; Those eyesâoh take those melting eyes away! Nor let those lips with honey'd sweets o'erflow;â Nor let meek Pity pale that lovely cheek, Nor weep, as wretches their long-sufferings speak. With forms so fair endued, oh! Venus, why Are Lesbian maids, or with such weakness I? Do Lesbian damsels touch the melting lyre? My lyre is mute; and I in silence gaze; As tho' the muse did not this breast inspire, I lose in tenderer loves the love of praise. Oh! Sappho, how art thou imprisoned round, Beauty's weak captive, fast-enchain'd with sound! Frail, frail resolve! vain promise of a day! I see, I hear, I feel, and die away. ANACREON TO A CAT. Prince of cats, with skin so sleek, Sharpen'd mouth, and jetty cheek, And tail, as coral shining-bright, And eyes, that can defy the night: With whiskers, claws, and scenting nose, For ever mousing, as it goesâ All these proclaim as mere a cat, As ever tuzzled mouse, or rat. But when I mark, thy mistress nigh, âAnd I have look'd with searching eye,â The purring soft, the tender gaze, And all thy little fondling ways, The playful tail, the touch so bland, When stroking Sappho's lovely hand, And when on Sappho's bosom spread, I see thee nestle close thy head, âAnd this, and more than this I see, Till, happy puss, I envy thee:â Oh! then, methinks, time was, that thou Wast not, what thou appearest now: While drinking thus of love thy fill, Thou seemest but a lover still;â Yes, prince of cats, if right I scan, The time has been, when thou wast, man. THE APOLOGIST. FROM THE FRENCH OF DE SEGUR. Think not, tho' gaily flows the lay, Too meanly of the tuneful art: Song claims the right to flirt and play, Nor less can act the moral part. Mirth, while it lightly trips along, The weightier Truth shall lift to light; And hence I learn to rev'rence song, While still its milder charms delight. The Samian prince, that prince severe, His people rul'd with iron hand: Great was his power, and great their fear; None durst resist the dread command. Anacreon charm'd the tyrant down, Assuag'd his wrath, and wak'd desire, Such force have tender numbers shewn! And hence I love the tender lyre. The rose, ere yet its leaves unfold, Requires the sun's enlivening ray; And, would you warm the heart, when cold? Go, try the love-inspiring lay. Ah! little aids the prose-told tale, Dress'd in no charms, nor wing'd with fire: But love, in verse, shall seldom fail; And therefore will I bless the lyre. Behold the man of dauntless brow, Who knows no measure in his crimes! To stoic rules he scorns to bow; He dreads no censor of the times. But ridicule, if it reprove, Shall leave the long-remember'd smart; And hence I love the shafts of song, For they can reach the guilty heart. When griefs and cares perplex'd my breast, To books I ran, to seek relief: But Plato could not yield me rest, And Seneca brought no relief. Anacreon, more one verse of thine, Than seven old sages, me shall please: Still, then, shall playful song be mine; For song the troubled heart shall ease! The DREAMS of PINDUS. In that blithe season, when, on every spray, Love lifts the fluttering wing, and warms each flow'r, In muse-frequented, fancy-colour'd bower, Sleep's pris'ner, lock'd in vision deep, I lay: Isis, fair river, flows the bower beside, Moist'ning the bank, as wont, with kisses sweet; While Cherwell pours along his silver tide, The kindred-stream in kind embrace to meet:â âAh! thus I cried, as now these streams combine, âMight man with fellow-man in friendly union join.â The stately sun had left his mid-day throne; And on the waters play'd his sloping beam; Silent awhile the feather'd warblers seem; And faint with heat, the daisied meadows shone. Soon as soft slumbers have ensnar'd my eyes, I hear a voice, that speaks in accent strong; âBright scenes shall rise successive: man, be wise, âAnd mark each shadowy form, that glides along.â Now all is still: a fairer landscape shines, Of Nature's liveliest green, of Beauty's boldest lines. One vision soon is past;âwhen I behold A Form descend, whom nine fair virgins led; A glory beams from his ambrosial head: Bright are his eyes: his locks all-shining gold: A golden chaplet binds his comely brows; His golden lyre with art is aptly strung: And now, with musings deep his visage glows, While nature rapt in mute attention hung. But when th' immortal minstrel strikes the lyre, What high-born raptures seize that blest enthusiast choir? What pencil may describe those virgins fair, Their mystic forms, their eyes of heav'nly light? Where poesy and music's powers unite, Who may their many-mingling charms declare? These damsels sing in turn, then sweep the string Of loftier harp, or breathe the melting lute; Now clang the citterns, now the cymbals ring, As different sounds the different genius suit. Thus Fancy, ever various, loves to please; Thus from light discord calls the sweeter harmonies. Proud was their song; of gods, and heroes brave, Of Jove loud-thundering, and his awful queen, And her, the virgin rare, of Sylvan mien, And Beauty's goddess, sprung from ocean wave: Nor less of her, the warrior, from whose eye Beam'd wisdom, gorgon-terror from whose breast; And him, that god, who lifts the tempest high, Or calms at will the raging sea to rest: All to whose power immortal heights belong; All, whom the muse has deign'd to raise in deathless song. But quickly now successive to my view, Far different forms, and different scenes arise, Suns dazzling-bright, and ever-purpling skies, Ambrosial streams, and fields of heavenly hue: And far away a wide-extended stream, Sacred the name, and dear in Eastern lore, (More stately lives not in the poet's dream) Rolls its proud wave beside the silent shore. And hark! a thousand songs to Mithra rise, Luxuriant as the fields, and glowing as the skies. The rapt'rous notes fill every sacred bower, Till now, as slumb'ring, clos'd the eye of day; Then pour'd the nightingale his liquid lay, Perch'd on a branch beside a favourite flower: And near the flower his eyes are glittering-bright; And near the flower his notes so wildly rove, As though his little breast with fond delight Would break, for blooming Rosa was his love. âSweetest of flowers, oh! still thy stay prolong: âOh! sweetest bird, still pour thy soothing melting song.â The scene is chang'dânow towering forms I view, With limbs of giant-size, and yellow hair; And loud to heaven they lift the warlike air; Bold is their front: their eyes of heavenly blue. Louder and louder still resounds the strain; Wild clash the shields, responsive to the sound; While warriors, mail'd in horror, scour the plain, And griesly foemen, groaning, bite the ground! âJoy to the brave!â I hear the bardic cry; âLift high (the day is won) the song of victory! And now fantastic forms around are seen, Goblins and griffins, sprites, a motley band, And he, who whilom rul'd in fairy-land, That merry, pranking king, and elfin queen. âOh! stay thee, Oberonâlo! a gentle knight âImplores thy aid, on val'rous deeds intent; âTrue to his love, and panting for the fight, âOn great emprize in distant regions bent.â Oberon is stay'd; âand take that horn, he cries, âAnd take that sacred ring, and every danger flies.â And lo! a castle rears its lofty wall, And fiery dragons guard the building round; Ah! who would dare to tread infernal ground? The knight has dared: no terrors may appal: Though hell were near the place, he must advance: Deep-foams his fiery steed, and prances high, Till, by the terror of his flaming lance, Close-lock'd in death those raving monsters lie. Loud-blows his horn: the gates wide open spread: And proud he enters in, and towers his crested head. And, oh! what freezing scenes to view unfold! How stare, with horror wild, his stony eyes! What piteous howlings, and what frantic cries! Stound are his ears! his blood runs shiveringâcold! Here deep enthrall'd lies many a lady bright, Ah! doom'd by giant curs'd to writhe in pain, Or yield, vile service! to his damn'd delight, Who, deep retir'd, here holds his dev'lish reign:â But by the knight's stout arm that monster fell Has felt the stroke of death, and hastens down to hell. âNow, ladies, take heav'n's fairest, richest boon, âFreedom is yours; God speed you on your way:â And now the knight shall hail the happy day; High the desert, and he shall triumph soon: A princess bright (such honours crown the brave) In pride of youth awaits thy wish'd return; Full many a fair, sir knight, 'twas thine to save; Nor vainly could that breast with glory burn. âAnd now the fairy scene eludes my sight; Fled is the princess fair, and fled the valorous knight. But hark! the master of the Runic rhime, Strikes the hoarse shell, and wakes the rumbling lay; And lo! the sire of men pursues his way, To try Vastrudnis' skill in truth sublime. Now Gothic wisdom beams upon my sight; Now mystic truth enchains my wond'ring mind; Whence earth and heav'n, and all those worlds of light, The mighty gods, and heroes of mankind; The Morning's virgin eye, Eve's purple glow, And all the flowers that bloom, and all the herbs that grow. But thick now hurtling in the murky air, See glittering helms, and many a quivering lance! And, lo! the fatal sisters now advance, Orkney, for woe! Erin for woe prepare! Lo! north and south the griesly spectres fly: Grim-visag'd Terror scowls on all the plain; And, hark! the pond'rous groan, the frantic cry, The cry, the groan of many a hero slain. âClose, scene of horror, on my aching eyes! The fatal dames are sped;âand lo! the vision flies. But mighty squadrons now embattle round, And guilty conquest has distain'd the field: Heralds of peaceâmust they to fury yield? Shall unarm'd victims feel the deadly wound? Yes! they have fall'n, the bards, fair Cambria's pride, Truth's tuneful priests, to heav'n they lift the prayer. Yet not unmourn'd the blameless victims died; See distant harpers hov'ring in the air! While brave Aneurin mourns his Hoel slain; And Pity droops the head at soft Llewellyn's strain. Thus do these visionary pageants gleam; Some quick retire, while others glittering rise; As once those angel-shapes from opening skies, Passing, repassing, liv'd in Jacob's dream. Ah! scenes that live in Fancy's fruitful eye! Ah! forms that can beguile a life of woe! Who, proud in truth, would ev'ry day-dream fly? Who, rob'd in wisdom, Fancy's charm forego? Return! unreal forms, if ye can please; Oh! take my sober thoughts, and wrap my soul in ease. Last in the train I hear a tuneful band, âStill vibrates on my ear the various song,â To whom the potent charms of verse belong; Mortals they seem, and seem of diff'rent land; Their voices diff'rent, loud, soft, shrill, and clear: How drinks my ear each bold and liquid lay! How thrills my heart with pity, love, and fear, As pierc'd with horror wild, or transport gay! Trembling, I cry, oh! might I aid that choir! But fruitless all the pray'râthe shadowy groups retire. Now all is past, and not a form is seen; While silence reignsâ(as when a vernal shower Sheds on the meadows round a fruitful store, And leaves the grateful landscape all serene) But soon,âthus changeful is the life of manâ Some genius leads me to a secret cave, Form'd by proportion's nicest, truest plan, And Ocean rolls beside the placid wave. Straight as I enter, oh! what sweet surprise Has seiz'd my raptur'd heart, and fill'd my ravish'd eyes! There art had cull'd from nature stores divine; There plac'd in brilliant rows with studious care, Whatever boasts the sea of treasures rare; Whate'er of sparkling ore conceals the mine; The branching coral, red, and white, and blue, The silvery pearl, the crystal bright and clear, Em'ralds of green, the ruby's scarlet hue, The pride of climes, and blossoms of the year; All, that could please and charm a gazer's eyes; For here, though small the spot, did seem a paradise. By nymphs attended, here a Sylvan maid, (Cities she fled, and spurn'd the chain of Love; Her love, to range the mountain, stream, and grove) Finds rest and coolness in the quiet shade. And near, an aged dame, of power supreme,â Prolific parent she, the sov'reign high Of nature's boundless realmsâyet fond did seem Of simplest chaplet, cull'd from meadows nigh. How mild her eye!âThus beams the morning lightâ How all the Goddess Form now swells upon my sight! âBe thine,â she said, and gaz'd upon the flowers, With looks of melting sweetness and delight, âWith many a dazzling scene to feast thy sight; âTo follow Fiction through her magic bowers; âTo trip with Fancy in her airy dance, âWith tiptoe revelries, and wild surprize: âTo mark each pageant in its proud advance âFrom shadowy deeps, and visionary skies: âSweet are the haunts, wherever genius roves, âThrough fields of vision'd bliss, or academic groves. âSooth'd into softness by the melting song, âCharm'd into reverence by the mighty theme, âBe thine to kindle at each muse's dream, âTo hail with reverence all the tuneful throng. âTheirs be the praiseânor slender be the praise,â âTo make new worlds, to burst the bounds of time, âTheir stately monument of fame to raise, âAnd on the heart to bind the magic rhyme: âBold their design, each daring charm to seize, âAnd rouse to wonder, where they mean to please. âThine be the warblings of the humbler lyre, âHumble, but not inglorious: thine to sing âThe Morning's glittering eye, the virgin Spring, âThe power of Beauty, Freedom's holy fire; âTo guide the youthful poet on his way; âTo rouse the virtues, soothe the soul of pain. Enough: if Genius may but feel the lay; Enough: if Friendship but approve the strain: And if, for life's short day-dream soon shall fly, The muse may charm a pang, or check a rising sigh. THE PADLOCKED LADY. A VISION. Hence the world!âand sleep my muse! So will I stroll, where'er I choose; Roll in my chariot o'er the seas; Or ride a broomstick, if I please; Breakfast with gods, and take my dinner With any saint, or any sinner; And sup at eve, to kill the spleen, With Mab, my little fairy-queen. 'Tis done;âand sleep has bound my eyes; â'Tis done; and now the vision flies: For, 'tis not given me to be long, To speak the myst'ries of my song. Listen ye young, and listen old, And try the vision to unfold. Far I travelled to the East, And far I travelled to the West; I pinch'd the North-Bear's frozen tail; And Southward, Southward, now I sail. As late I wander far, and far, To watch the rising ev'ning-star; And, heedless of the lapse of time, Muse, as I go, the mystic rhyme, From human footsteps far I stray, Thro' deep long labyrinths of way; Till now, from mazes round and round, My feet have reach'd their utmost bound: For, on the lonely rocky shore, I hear the ocean's thund'ring roar. Above my head huge mountains rise, That seem to lift a weight of skies Where, lost in the mysterious height, The garish eagle wires his flight. Ah! vain it were to track the wind, As, backward now the path to find! And forward nothing can I view, But boundless seas, and skies of blue. And who will guide my doubtful feet? Oh! might I some kind genius meet! For lonely, ah! lonely, here I stray, Pilgrim benighted on my way. âBehold me, on your call attendâ âPilgrim! Behold your guide and friend.â I lookâand, wondering, I behold Near me a Form erect, but old. White was his beard, as virgin-snows, And a white garment downward flows. Still on his cheek the rose was spread; And his blue eyes a lustre shed. For, though in years he seem'd a Sage, His was the reverend charm of age. âPilgrim bewildered, I would know, âWhat is the course thy feet would go? âBut, ere my hand direct the way, âSay, pilgrim, whence thy footsteps stray?â As late enwrapt in sleep I lay, While still smil'd out the face of day, I saw a Form, as seraph bright, Descend from realms of heavenly light. Her wings, wide-waving, brightly shone, Resplendent as an eastern sun. Her locks of gold stream loose behind, Disporting in the frolic wind. The rosy cheek, the eye of fire, The gay luxuriance of attire, Her movements, negligently gay, Distinctly to my gaze display, Far, far beyond the reach of art, All, that can win upon the heart. My heart is won, and now I rove, If I may see the form I love. My heart is won, and yet my heart Feels nought of love, except the smart. For ne'er, methought, these eyes shall see, A being heavenly-fair as she. Still while I press, her image flies, And in my void embraces dies; A restless lover, still I stray, Flitting, and urging life away. I seek what never may be found; And I have sought the world around. Swift as the wing of morning-light, Downward I first direct my flight. Nile, Egypt's pride, in current strong, Rolls the salubrious stream along. And now, I range at large the shores Thro' all the motley tribes of Moors; Nations and kingdoms far and wide, As still my strong affections guide; This all my wish, and all my prayer, âOh! might I find this heavenly fair!â Lo! backward then I urge my course, And track the Nile's prolific source. Till, quick as thought, I traverse o'er The desert plain, the mountain hoar; Tracts immense of blasted land, Boggy wastes, and scorching sand, Where never rain descends in showers, Nor zephyr lingers in the bowers: No fruit, no herb, no flowers appear;â One burning summer binds the year. I hear the Lybian lion roar; I pass the tiger, gorg'd with gore. The sullen bear beside me prowls, And the grim wolf, as famish'd, howls. âBold is my heart, my spirits gay, I heed no troublers of the way. Thus thro' all Afric's realms I go, Still anxious thro' those realms to know, â'Tis all my wish, 'tis all my pray'r,â If here might dwell this heav'nly fair. They bring a dame, âand this is she, âBeauteous and wife, and great and free.â âAzza her name, I wear her chain, âAnd far and wide is Azza's reign.â My heavenly fair! it was not she:â Azza was neither fair, nor free. Her visage dark, but told within Some hidden mystery of stn. Darkly her savage eyeballs roll, But darker, ah! darker was her soul. Vers'd in the depth of female wiles, Death, slav'ry, hell, were in her smiles. Hence in disdain I took my flight, Who shall mislead a lover's sight? Lo! now I face the eastern sun! And quick as light my course is run. Bright upon my ravish'd eyes, All Asia's golden glories rise. Full in my sight, before me go, In all the pomp and pride of show, Kings, princes, emperors, sages grave, Warrior-chiefs, and heroes brave. And many a female form is seen, And each might pass for Beauty's queen: Still all my wish and all my prayer, âOh! could I meet my heavenly fair!â They bring a dame, âand this is she;â âLeila is beauteous, great and free.â Not the crystal, clear and bright, Shone like her eyes' Ã¦therial light; Not the pearl, however fair, Could with her snowy skin compare; Her cheek a colour did disclose, Beyond the ruby, or the rose; Her locks in easy ringlets play'd, Darker than night's mysterious shade: Her lovely lips were blushing-red, Like coral in its native bed; Her breath than violet more sweet; Her teeth like iv'ry white and neat. And to what Nature could impart, Leila had ev'ry charm of Art. Realms were subject to her sway, And hosts of slaves her call obey. Merchants and nobles do but roam, To bring for Leila treasures home. Heziaz' nards, and Mecca's flowers, And all the soul of Tuda's bowers; Each perfume, that its sweets distills, From Naged's groves, or Naidis' hills; All that in Golconda shines Of glittering rock, or golden mines; All on the lovely Leila wait, For not more beauteous she than great. But what is beauty, what is power? Fleeting like the passing hour. Beauty, scarce beauty seems to be, That spurns the glory to be free. Riches are poor, and power is weak, Unless they nobler triumphs seek. Leila would every thought control, For she was tyrant in the soul. My heavenly fair!âIt was not sheâ I scorn the dame, that is not free. Hence in disdain I take my flight: Who shall mislead a lover's sight? But loftier now I soar in soul, Uprising towards the northern pole: O'er woods, and rocks, and hills of snow, Swift as the whirlwind's speed I go. Now on the ocean vast I roam, And see the Norway monster foam, Floating along for many a mile, As some proud sea encircled isle; While, like tall masts, sea serpents rise, With sinuous motions to the skies: Till backward now I gain the strand, And traverse thro' each distant land. Swift thro' Lapland's frosts I haste; Swift thro' Siberia's trackless waste; See people fierce, and people strong, In hardy squadrons wheel along; See princes in long order go, With royal port and martial brow; See many a smiling royal dame, With eye of fire, and stately frame; Still all my wish, and all my prayer, âWhere shall I find my heavenly fair?â âBehold your dame! and this is she; âSkada is beauteous, fair, and free.â My heavenly fair! It was not she:â Skada was neither fair nor free. Wild was her look, and stern her air, Fierce as a northern meteor's glare. Skada, tho' practis'd long in art, Ne'er felt the softness of the heart. Her will was law; her word was fate: Her only glory to be great. Hence in disdain I take my flight; Who shall mislead a lover's fight? Now like a spirit airy-free, Soon have I pass'd th' Atlantic sea; And I have reach'd Columbia's shore, And travell'd motley nations o'er. Rapt in my strange mysterious love, Northward many a league I rove. Still anxious, restless still I go, O'er seas of ice, and hills of snow; Valleys, that shew no verdure's pride, And lakes, that spread like ocean wide; Till pinnacling a neck of land, Between two boundless seas I stand. Then downward far I take my flight, O'er sunny plains, o'er many an height. Peruvian mines, and Chili's shades Soon my restless soul pervades; Rivers, that teem with golden ore, And rocks, that gild the southern shore. And many a youth, and many a dame, Of lofty port, and royal name, Pass and repass before my sight, All in glittering robes bedight. Yet none of all the dames I see, Is like my charmer fair and free. Again, as quick as lightning fleets, I pass the equinoctial heats. And now I wander every plain, Wide-stretching towards th' Atlantic main. Here many a distant state I see All by one settled league agree; (As still around a glorious sun, The planets far-encircling run;) Each people differing much in name, But still in arts and laws the same. Here Love was gay, and honest Toil Had labour'd long the happy soil: And Plenty well rewards the pain, For every field wide-waves with grain.; With sail outstretch'd, while Commerce stands, Prepar'd to visit distant lands; Tho' Want compells no swain to roam, For Peace endears a native home. Ah! happy, happy people tell, Does here my lovely charmer dwell? Still all my wish and all my prayer, That I might meet my heavenly fair. They bring a dameââand this is sheâ âLo! Eleutheria! great and free.â The dame was free, the dame was bright, Glittering her eye, like heaven's own light. Her locks of gold stream loose behind, Disporting as the frolic wind. The rosy cheek, the soul of fire, The gay luxuriance of attire; Her movements, negligently gay, Distinctly to my gaze display, Far, far beyond the reach of art, All, that can win upon the heart. Warm glows my breast; my spirits rise;â And rapture kindles in my eyes! Till shivering cold, at length, prevails Thro' all my limbsâand language fails. Then accents faint my soul declare, âYes! thou art she! my heavenly fair.â With virgin blush and smiling eyes Fair Eleutheria straight repliesâ Pilgrim, not yet thy course is run, Pilgrim, not yet thy labour done. Tho' mild my form, tho' free my air, Yet am I not thy noble fair; Tho' still with her I kindred claim, And from her I derive my name. In a gay isle, beyond the main, My mother holds her golden reign. The fairest she the fair among, For ever fair, for ever young. And she hath many ages told; But seems in wisdom only old. Tho' small the native realms she owns, Yet does she govern distant thrones. Her empire reaches far and wide; Thro' every sea her navies ride: The treasures rare of every soil She brings, to bless her fav'rite isle. And, while she boasts the treasures rare, Still her own fields are fresh and fair. This said, fair Eleutheria flies, Quick-glancing from my longing eyes. High-beats my lofty soul again; I skim across th' Atlantic main: This isle I seeâmy hopes expand; And quick I traverse all the land. But tho' I travel round and round, Yet no where is my charmer found: Tho' still my wish, and still my prayer, Oh! could I meet my heavenly fair! And here at length my course I stay, From many a labyrinth wild of way. What fate, oh Sage! remains for me? Say, canst thou read Heaven's high decree? The Sage repliesâYes! son, I know, Whence thou dost come, and where wouldst go. Pilgrim, not yet thy course is run, Pilgrim, not yet thy labour done. Heav'n's ways I readâand well attend; In me behold a guide and friend. In vain thy wanderings far and near, Thy lovely mistress dwells not here. The isle, for which thy spirit sighs, Still many a league in distance lies. Nor let these words thy soul affright, Lo! once for all I set thee right. He saidâand high he rais'd his hand; And wide he wav'd his magic wand; When thus: âTo man 'tis giv'n to know âHis share of bliss, and share of woe. âSoon shalt thou view the wish'd-for isle, âTowards which thou long wast doom'd to toil; âSoon shalt behold the matchless dame, âWhom thou dost âheavenly fairâ proclaim. âAnd thou shalt view her passing-great, âRob'd in full majesty of state; âBut still, with soul of anguish too, âThat heav'nly Fair degraded view. âMy mission past, lo! I retire, âThy guide is nearâno more inquire.â Soft-glides a vessel now to shore, And, lo! the Sage is seen no more. I enterâsoftly blows the breeze; Mild is the sun, and smooth the seas. With swelling sail, and streamers gay, The vessel cuts the watry way. Soft Lydian measures lull to rest The rising cares, that swell my breast. No adverse winds obstruct our course; No marshall'd billows urge their force. In quiet state and gilded pride, Quick o'er the ocean-stream we glide. Till soon, in skies of lightest blue, Glittering cliffs ascend to view; And now behold the wish'd-for land! And now we wander o'er the strand. Nor doubts, nor fears, my course impede, I follow on, as Heav'n may lead. In a long deep recess there lies A cave unseen by mortal eyes. High on each side huge rocks arise, And proudly seem to scale the skies. The jetting sides compose a bay, Where Ocean lingers long his way: For here the silent waters sleep, As broken from the parent deep. Woods grace the rocks, and from their brow On the dark waters frown below. See now before my ravished eyes A mighty scene of wonders rise! The waters near the cave are fled, And mingle with their native bed. Then soon I view the sacred cave, Clos'd in, till now, beneath the wave. And wide the massy gates unfold, Massy gates of glittering gold. Thro' all my limbs what trembling reigns! What freezing runs thro' all my veins!â Spring in alarm my hopes and fears; With sounds unusual ring my ears. And from my cheek the colour flies; And all of sight has left my eyes. My voice is gone,âand swims my head,â I seem, as life itself were fled. When, lo! the Sage who set aright My course, appears again in sight. And high aloft he lifts his hand, And wide he waves his magic wand. I glow againâmy fears are borne Swift, as retreat the dreams of morn: I enter, gazing round and round, As treading consecrated ground. Here I behold each emblem fair Of every art and science rare. There a gay vessel charms my sight, In pearls, and glittering diamonds bright, A ship's fair model, emblem made Of commerce, far and wide display'd; And relicks rare of ancient times, And stones and gems of distant climes, And silks of more than Tyrian dies, And flow'rs, and fruits of warmest skies. Now gazing on from side to side, I pierce a forest's branching pride. And every tree of living hue Spreads its full honours to the view. Here rise the poplar's silvery lines, And ash with scarlet berries shines; The cypress walk, for lovers made, And cedar's deep religious shade. The chesnut's dark umbrageous green, With many a flowery gem between, Doth each its daintiest verdure spread, Lifting aloft the towering head. But above all conspicuous stands, And wide its reverend arms expands, As it a thousand years had stood, The oak, great monarch of the wood. And many a youth, and many a maid, Were dancing in the chequer'd shade. While by woodside, on mountain steep, Wander'd a flock of snow-white sheep; And sidelong stretch'd a shepherd gay, Piping his sweetest pastoral lay. Still I advanceâtill soon I gain, In musing lost, a spacious plain. When thus my old magician-friend, Pilgrim, lo! here thy wanderings end. I look, and full before my eyes, A thousand thousand glories rise. High seated on a stately throne, That form divinely glorious shone; Shone out that form transcendent-bright, That whilom charm'd my ravish'd sight; Which I had sought, but never found, Tho' wandering wild the world around; Which still could every care beguile;â And she was goddess of the isle. On either side a brilliant band In silent adoration stand, The highborn natives of the isle, And strangers, from a distant soil; âFor far and wide was spread her fame, And all who knew, rever'd the name.â And here of every land and tongue, Were masters of the mighty song; All proud to lift their loftiest lays, And sound this heavenly Lady's praise. I hear the warblings of the lyre, As teeming with Apollo's fire. The deep mouth'd organ's peal I hear, As tho' Cecilia's soul were near. I hear the trumpet's martial sound, As warrior-souls were thronging round. And the drum's longest, loudest beat, As when two hostile armies meet. I hear the melting lute complain, As telling Love's delicious pain. And thousand voices too I hear, Loud and strong, and soft and clear, All in one mighty theme combine, All in symphonious chorus join. Deep rolls the stream of sound along, In the full majesty of song. And still the descant's boldest lays Clos'd with the burden of her praise. But, ah! not splendid scenes alone, And Peace's milder lustre shone; Nor only Plenty's form appears; Nor only Music charms the ears. Hark! I hearânot distant far March'd the Giant Fiend of war. Yonder roll'd the kindled storms, Yonder strode the warrior forms. Arms against arms embattled clang, And with wild shouts the mountain rang. Who may the warrior's pride control?â Lavish, too lavish of the soul, Lo! many a gallant hero slain, And blood empurples all the slain. Faint, and more faint they draw their breath, And, hark! the mighty groan in death. While famish'd eagles hovering round Drink life-blood from each gasping wound. In vain for sires the children mourn, And wives expect their lords return. Quick thro' their veins the spirits flee, Nor wife, nor child, they more shall see. New horrors rise!âBehold a throng Of hapless negroes trail along; From native lands the sufferers go, To nurse their long, long tale of woe; In distant realms, to toil unknown; To pour unheard the secret groan; To wear the vile tremendous chain; And linger life away in pain. Rest of the dear delights of life, Friend, parent, husband, child, and wife; Like the poor refuse of their race, Labour their all, and long disgrace. And e'en where splendid scenes arise, While Peace looks on with smiling eyes, Where Plenty's cheerful form appears, And sweetest music charms the ears, Many a feeble form I view, And many a cheek of pallid hue. Want was there, and trembling Age Pining in life's last lingering stage. And, e'en amid the tuneful throng Was many a son of rapturous song, But mute as tho' the Muses' fires Ne'er warm'd their hearts, or rous'd their lyres. In vain sweet measures thrill around; In vain the swell and pomp of sound; What shall the soul all-hopeless cheer? The numbers die upon their ear. Silent they sat, while thro' their souls A tide of mighty sorrows rolls. I now, with slow and awful pace, Approach the Lady of the place: When, sudden on my wondering eyes, I see a curious structure rise: A high triumphant arch, that wears The beauteous reverend pomp of years: âAs when, in Grecia's happier days, The conqu'ror claim'd his wreathe of praise, And, in gay triumphs, proud to ride, With vanquish'd warriors by his sideâ High o'er the arch distinctly shone, An emblem of the glorious sun: Six wandering stars, with motion slow, All in different orbits go. Above, another errant light, Holds on its course, all paly-bright: With orbit wide, and vast his size, He looks the monarch of the skies. Soon o'er the plain, through all the rows, A busy bustling tumult glows: And soon again, with martial grace, Each closes in his destin'd place. And two and two, and hand in hand, In grand procession moves the band. And trophies proud they bear along, Rousing the clash of martial song. And as with stately tread they march, Ere yet they pass the solemn arch, Each bow'd before that seventh light, That held from far his paly light. Of orbit wide, and largest size, That look'd the monarch of the skies. Lo! past is all the crowd along, And sunk the swell of martial song. And now alone upon the plain I with that awful queen remain, The goddess fair, so heav'nly bright, That first in vision met my sight. What shall the generous soul affray? I tread resolv'd the arduous way. Love can doubts and fears control; And give new vigour to the soul. Nearer and nearer still I drew, To yield this goddess homage due; To tell her how in toil and pain, I sought her true, tho' sought in vain, Now gently urg'd, now wildly hurld, Had travell'd restless round the world, Her vision'd form my only rest, And she the fire, that warm'd my breast. âBut, oh! what tortures rack my soul! How wild and wild my eyeballs roll! I view her near,âand still more near;â Then stand a statue, chill'd with fear. Clos'd were her eyes to all around, And in a golden bandage bound; Nor could she voice of mortal hear; A death-like deafness bound her ear. While from her lips, to seal her tongue, A vile inglorious Padlock hung. I struggle,âbut in vain,âfor breath,â I seem as in the grasp of death. To Heav'n I lift my burning eyes;â I start!âand lo! the vision flies. ALFRED. I Ah! why should Song, enchanting Song, Her vot'ries lead thro' Error's maze? Why Flattery, poisoning future days, Give pride those laurels that to truth belong? Avaunt, thou bard of ancient time! I hate the base insidious Lyre, That bids the dazzled crowds retire, While tyrants sit as gods sublime. II I love the man of generous frame, Who teems with love of human kind, Who leaves the vulgar great behind, And scorns the splendid treach'ries of a name. Heroes have bask'd, a serpent-brood, Hatch'd by Ambition's baneful ray; Conqu'rors, high-mail'd in war array, Have reel'd, mere dÃ¦mons, drunk with blood. III Where Discord holds her torch on high, Recount the warrior Romans dead, The blood of generous Britons shed, O'er vassal sons hear humbled Gallia sigh: How streams the Rhine with German gore! Let CÃ¦sar mount the victor's car;â And Rome, amid the spoils of war, Her conqu'ror, and the world's, adore. IV Ah! vain the pomp, th' imperial sway! When Justice takes her watchful stand, Actions she weighs with patient hand, Nor will she rashly throw her palms away. She spurns the mad heroic race!â And oft, while pÃ¦ans rend the skies, While altars breathing incense rise, The conqu'ror marks for long disgrace. V Yet, Fame, thy fair Elysium raise, And Genius, cull thy wreathe of flowers, And, seated in unfading bowers, Alfred, ennobled shine through endless days! I see, I scale the mount sublime! Lost in the beams of heavenly light, I see 'mid streams, as crystal bright, The bards, who rais'd the lofty rhyme. VI âBlest, Alfred, be thy honour'd name, â(A people's voice of praise is sweet) âAnd sweet the songs, his ear that greet, âThe Prince, whose bosom glows with Freedom's flame. âStill blossom, 'mid the lapse of years, âThe laurels wreath'd on Virtue's brow; âIn richer pride her honours blow, âAnd age her memory but endears. VII âSee Britain rising from her seat, âProud of her rights, and equal laws, âArdent in Freedom's sacred cause:â She found thee wise, and has proclaim'd thee great. â'Twas thine each citizen to fire; âThey pant the thirsty lance to wield: âThey rush impetuous to the field; âAnd Freedom sees her foes expire.â VIII They ceas'dâand cease the lyric strain:â For Alfred lives to bless no more; Though still, its day of splendor o'er, Downward the sun but sinks to rise again. Thus Alfred shines in deathless fame, And darting golden glories high, Still marches stately through the sky, While gazing nations bless his name. THE FUNERAL PROCESSION OF POLLY WHITEHEAD. As lately I slept, ere yet approach'd the night, Not one lively dream would my slumbers delight, But screams rend my ears, and horrors fill my sight, For ghosts, furies, devils, around seem'd to fight. So I startled and groan'd, And I sigh'd, and I moan'd, Then round about I tumbled, And I rumbled, and jumbled;â But, I was all alone, and so no one could I fright. Then I wake and get up, and my pillow duly spread, Till furies and devils are all fairly fled; When a funeral procession succeeds in their stead; So now solemn fancies get into my head. And thus straight I began; âWhat, alas! is poor man, âOr what woman, who shares âAll his griefs, and his cares?â And a sad flood of tears, I in sympathy shed. Methought I was walking, as poets oft do, Of sweet country air to drink one gale or two, On the city new road, 'mid folks not a few, Husbands, wives with their bantlings, and sweet hearts so true. And when now I look back, What a crowd all in black! And from Moorfields they pad, Silent, solemn, and sad, For Bunhill-field's burying-ground they have in view. So curious and thoughtful, I now take my stand, With a troop of old gossips, a newsmongering band. Who, without much ado make me soon understand, What a terrible ill has befallen the land; An ill, that rich and poor Would have reason to deplore, That to dames of each degree Would be cause of misery. And we alike had cause to fear, lest we should be trepann'd;â And all London they knew, and all London's wife, Who liv'd happy couples, and who liv'd in strife, What wives were a-breeding, where cuckolds were rife, Rogues soon to be hung, saints departing this life: So all at once they tell How a lily-white belle, Oh! the dearest dear creature, And so lamb-like in feature, Had just been cut up by death's murd'rous knife. To thousands and thousands this Polly was dear, And thousands for Polly will now shed the tear, As soon, if you look, will be now made appear, For the groaners and mourners will all soon be here. And so by me they move, All lamenting their love; And they seem'd to abound, As ants cover the ground, Sad black-tufted knights, whom, ah! nothing will cheer. First the stationers come, and with great cause to mourn, For since Polly travels to that dismal bourne From which mortals more, ah! never shall return, Alas! they are not able a penny more to earn. They must now shut up their hall, Or on some new scheme must fall, And never more look gay, On a lord-mayor's merry day, So their ink they throw away, and their pens all they will burn. And now come of authors a tribe great and small, With great sense, and little sense, and no sense at all; They must now give o'er writing, or get themselves in thrall; So all the land will now in Egypt's darkness crawl. For no more will they write, Nor give a wink of light; Henceforth they must turn ushers, Or stoop to be bumbrushers, Apothecaries, priests, or clerks, as it may fall. The printers now succeed all in lamentable taking, For since Polly Whitehead this world is now forsaking, All their presses must stand still, every soul will soon be breaking, Since printing first began, there was never such heart-aching. See compositors all go, With their heads quite crack'd with woe; And the pressmen, saucy race, Who oft smack'd Polly's face, But now, for all their airs, they are awkward faces making. Next their journeymen, their 'prentices, and devils follow all, And, ah! where shall they fly? to whom for succour call? Ev'ry shop is now shut up, there's not left a single stall, And when masters thus all fail, soon their servants too must fall. Tears, like show'rs trickling flow, Wild and wild is their woe, Who for poor men will feel? They must dig, beg, or steal: In limbo when they get, who will take them from their thrall? Next a troop of bookbinders appear full in view, And as sorrowful as any, to give them all their due: For as husbands, who oft make their wives black and blue, When their dearies once are dead, then their follies quickly rue. Thus the book-binding trade, Did lament the dear maid; For, alas! they had lump'd her, They had pinch'd her, and thump'd her; And so to all comfort they now bid adieu. The booksellers next follow, and a comely-looking band, From the Row, Paul's Church-yard, Cheapside and the Strand; How deep, alas! their woe! all their trade's now at a standâ For she is now no more, who their every hope once fann'd. For, ah! not, as heretofore, Can they feast their authors more; For since Polly dear is dead, All their profits now are fled; So Old England they will leave, to seek some other land. Newspaper-folks now follow to see poor Polly's end, Who, when the mourning's over, their course away will bend: Their presses all are still, and the times will never mend; And not a newsman more their bloody news will vend. Hush'd now is all their fun, Clos'd their bag of Helicon; They care not now a pin, Who's out, or who is in; And their columns now no more they with ladies routs distend. Now come Old England's friends, who, while Polly was alive, Hop'd that Alfred's laws and England together would revive. To spread the people's rights they did boldly once contrive; But now 'tis o'er, the die is cast, and they no more will strive. Old Nick may have the law, That but crams a premier's maw; For, since Polly dear is dead, Every hope of Freedom's fled; And the bees will now leave England, where none but drones will hive. And, lo! the last in order I behold the poet-train; Some who work'd about the drama, some who plied the epic strain; Some who heroes lov'd to tickle, some who sooth'd the lover's pain; And some, who wrote for glory, and some who wrote for gain. Had fate but left to choose, They had rather lost the Muse, Or for PhÅbus, god of song, Padded, moping thus along; Their hearts will all be broken, and turn'd be every brain. So ready now I stand, with my sympathetic tear, Having just ek'd out an ode, to welcome the new year; And, as an undertaker's shop to me was very near, I got a gown and hatband, and jostled in the rear. âSo poets, with your leave, âI come with you to grieve: âThe humblest of your train, âGreatest cause has to complain; âFor Polly I could die, she was my dearest dear.â So now all pale and sad we approach the burying-ground, And sighings sad, and groanings deep, and wailings wild abound, For stout and brawny Irishmen were howling all around; And they, dear hearts, for Polly fair will raise their country's sound. The priest begins to read, But, good soul, cannot proceed; And to heav'n he casts a look, And then down he drops his book; For he can't pray, nor read, nor yet his text expound. So now we waddle back, a woe-bewilder'd throng, Heads drooping, hands wringing, ah! how we creep along. And I tried my skill in elegiac song, For sad strains suit weak souls, as lofty do the strong. For most woeful bard am I, Who by instinct seem to cry. âSo to soothe my secret pain, I penn'd down a mournful strain, Which did of right, thro' Britain wide, to mourners all belong. A MONODY. ON THE DEATH OF PENELOPE TROTTER. Right well have learned doctors shewn That one grief never comes alone; But, as the rain comes pattering down, Stream after stream upon your crown, So man no sooner one gripe feels, Than t'other nips him by the heels; Till we scarce know, tho' grieve we must, Where to begin our tale of sorrow first. Ah! lack and a-well-a-day! I erst who wet poor Polly Whitehead's clay With tears so hot, must now, alas! shed hotter; For Death has tripp'd the heels of Peny Trotter. Nor I aloneâall London, sad at heart, Doffs the gay robe, and takes the garb of woe, And tears, as from their springs the waters start, From East, West, North, and South, are seen to flow. For ten miles London round was Peny known, No dame East, West, North, South, so bright in fame: To young and old alike her love was shewn, And all expectant stood at Peny's name. She was not young, yet mov'd with nimble feet; Aged she was not, though in mind a sage: Her youth retain'd whate'er of youth is sweet, As erst her youth what gains respect in age. She frisk'd not, while a girl, in girlish mood, Nor kiss'd and toy'd, as maids are wont to do; Nor on the road e'er lingerd to be woo'd, And knew her duty better than to woo. Her errand done, she had no gossip's tale; But would with maiden modesty retire; And tho' perchance she took a cup of ale, Stopt not, to slumber near the kitchen fire. This bustling life for many a year she led, True as the needle thus her duty plied; And thousand, thousand masters droop the head, For ne'er than Pen a trustier servant died. Oh! calmer dear of Grief, Sweet Melancholy, come; What now may yield relief, While Pen lies in the tomb? What but thy pensive air, Meek eye, and brow of care, Thy liquid eye, thy melting strain, And the light visions of thy brain, The forms, that to thy midnight-musings throng, And fill with unpremeditated song? But how shall I relate The wayward cruelties of fate? How in indignant verse Pen's hapless end rehearse? For not, as gentle dames should die, she died, Peaceful, upon her bed; But while on duty bent she hied, Behold her dead! Her snow-white flesh by hands most cruel whipt, Till of her very skin the maid is stript! But who were they, what tyger men, That laid their fangs on honest Pen? No vulgar ruffians they, Who prowl on the highway, Or clap, amid your midnight rest, The felon-pistol to your breast. No, it was none of these, Nor was it dire disease, Fever, catarrh, or spasm, or cholic, Nor any young and wanton frolic; Nor did intemp'rance ply the venom'd cup, âPen there would never take above a sup, Satan could not have made her drink it up.â Noâsurer, quicker than all these, Than pistol, dagger, or than tyger-claw, Than foul intemp'rance, or than rank disease, The wretch, that murder'd Pen, wasâLaw. Oh! Law, tho' sages are so fond to prove, That thou in nature's bosom hast thy seat, And that thy voice, inspiring awe and love, Preserves the world in harmony complete; That heav'n and earth to thee their homage pay, That great and small alike thy care employ, That ev'ry being gladly owns thy sway, And hails thee mother of their peace and joy; Yet art not thou too often made, By man, that debauchee, a jade, Quite marr'd and jarr'd in ev'ry feature, The veriest, foulest, most discordant creature, Whirling the world about in strife, Bursting the dearest bonds of life; Lumping, and thumping each rebellious elf, A bolder rebel still thyself?â âIf, when my eyes are lock d in sleep, Thou near me dost thy vigils keep, Why, then I prize thee more than all my wealth, And am content to drink thy health; But, if thou canst embastille honest men, And kill so good a soul as honest Pen; Then, to be plain, I'll make no fuss about you; Ma'am, I had rather live without you. THE END.</field>
