      <field name="fulltext">[Vol. I.] A SUMMARY Of the Reigns of Q. Elizabeth and K. James; Together with their Characters, by way of Introduction. When Popish Priestcraft in a cruel Reign, Had reinslav'd the Nation once again, And by their smoaky Piles eclips'd the Light Of Truth, that steer'd the wand'ring Christian right, Good Heav'n, as if offended at the Guilt Of Martyrs Blood, the Holy Robe had spilt, Cut short Maria's Reign, to stop the Rage Of sacred Tyrants, in a sheepish Age, When Zeal and Bigottry had numb'd the Wits Of all but those who knew their Holy Cheats; Till good Eliza, Born to be the great Reformer of the English Church and State, By calm and gentle Methods chang'd the Scene, And acted like a wise and glorious Queen, Brought home the Rev'rend Mitre to the Crown, And made the Pope's Supremacy Her own, Freed the whole Kingdom from the Yoke of Rome, And gave Reforming Rules to Christendom; Pursu'd her Father's Steps in that alone, And crown'd the Work he had so well begun. Thus like a grateful Daughter she ador'd And hug'd his Vertues but his Vice abhor'd. So the wise Gard'ner hows away the Weeds, And cherishes the growth of useful Seeds. Destin'd by Heav'n not only to command, But to redeem a poor distressed Land, The Royal Virgin thus began to low'r The Pride of Rome, that soar'd so high before, And to protect, encourage and advance The long oppress'd and injur'd Protestants; From gloomy Jayls and Fetters set 'em free, And eas'd them of the Yoke of Tyranny, Restor'd their Rights, defy'd St. Peter's Chair, And made the Mass give way to Common-Pray'r: Nor did she steer with an immod'rate Gale, Or suffer stormy Zeal to fill her Sail, But with a gentle Breeze did forward glide, And 'twixt the jarring Parties stem'd the Tide, Till by a lawful Course she gain'd her Port, Amidst the Cliffs of a divided Court; Like a wise Pilot little Canvas spread, For fear of Storms, till safely got a-head Of Rome's high Rocks, and then, as she design'd, She hoisted up her Top-sails to her Mind, And out of danger run before the Wind. Tho' many Troubles in her Reign arose, From faithless Friends, as well as foreign Foes, Yet she advanc'd her Realm to greater Pow'r Than all her Predecessors had before. Great Guns at home she Cast of ev'ry sort, And from Abroad did many Arms import; Enlarg'd her Navy, who, where'er they came, Proclaim'd the Greatness of their Royal Dame: The French she kept in awe, defeated Spain, And reign'd sole Empress of the restless Main; United Ireland to the English Throne, Made Scotland tremble if she did but Frown; By wholsome Laws our Foreign Trade improv'd, Was honour'd much Abroad, at Home belov'd; Suffer'd no Party to ingross the Pow'r, That one by Turns might t'other Side devour; Took care no crafty Upstarts should betray The Throne, or on their Native Country prey: But as a Royal Nursing-Mother shou'd, Sought her own Glory in her Peoples Good; Succour'd her suff'ring Neighbours in Distress, Lov'd to Defend, but hated to Oppress; Rais'd her own Kingdom from a wretched State Of Slav'ry, to be formidably Great; Did worthy Fav'rites honestly prefer To Wealth, in Peace, without the Art of War; To Moderation low'rd Canonick Pride, And left the Nation Happy when she dy'd; Rich and in Safety, from Contention free, Pow'rful by Land, invincible by Sea; That after Ages might her Worth proclaim, And as the Best of Queens exalt her Fame, Who govern'd well, but not without some Blame. Of Learning she'd above a Woman's Share, Stately her Mien, but not exceeding Fair: In all she did true Majesty was seen, And when she spoke, 'twas awful, like a Queen: Her Looks and Temper were alike sedate, Her Judgment piercing, and her Wisdom great; Like a true Hero always would appear The most undaunted when she'd most to fear; Despis'd what Dangers did her Throne surround, And shew'd a chearful Face when Fortune frown'd. Mercy and Justice both her Talents were, Which was most safe she wisely would prefer; And neither by Revenge nor Love be mov'd, To Spare or Punish if it dang'rous prov'd. These were her Royal Vertues, tho' 'tis true, She had some Failings, those (alas) but few, Sufficient only to convince the Crowd, That Ruling Princes, tho' they're ne'er so good, Like those they govern, are but Flesh and Blood. When Great Eliza, at a rev'rend Age, For Peace eternal left the publick Stage, James by undoubted Right ascends the Throne, And joins the neighb'ring Monarchies in one; Fraught with Experience, Learning, Wit, and Worth, For Southern Empire he forsakes the North, Where, on a ticklish Throne he'd Reign'd before, A King, for thirty five long Years and more, Render'd thereby well worthy to succeed A Queen, by Heav'n for humane Good decreed; Nor were his Vertues to be less admir'd Than hers, for both were equally inspir'd, Govern'd alike, with so much Ease and Art, As if they acted with the self-same Heart, Or were, at least, each other's Counterpart. As in a Rich and Happy State he found The Realm, in Peace with all his Neighbours round, His Subjects quiet, their Allegiance sure, The Clergy easy, and the Church secure; His Court with able Ministers supply'd, His Navy strong, and all things safe beside; So, like a King, whom God had call'd to bless His People, he survey'd his Happiness, Wisely resolving firmly to pursue The glorious Scheme his Predecessor drew, And to defend and zealously maintain Th'establish'd Worship of the former Reign, And with all Christian Policy and Care, Avoid the Curse of an ambitious War, That fatal Error in a Prince that Rules, The Bane of Nations and the Scourge of Fools, Which promises great Wonders till it's try'd, But ends in Mis'ry as begun in Pride: For War, like Love, if vicious and unjust, Tho' carry'd smoothly on to please our Lust, Yet both, in time, our Wealth and Sinews wast, And bring us to repenting Sighs at last. The Northern Monarch therefore stood his ground, Preserv'd the Nation in the state 'twas found, Did by wise Counsel greater Points obtain, Than other Kings by dint of Arms could gain, And ne'er would humour factious Pride so far, As to consume the Fruits of Peace in War, Knowing that blust'ring Mars was full as bad A Cut-purse as his Venus was a Jade, And that his cruel Sword did greater Harms, When madly drawn, than wanton Beauty's Charms; He therefore well improv'd the Nation's Store, By Peace, which had by Peace been gain'd before, Laid up for War, to which he'd ne'er agree, Till call'd to't by supreme Necessity. Thus in a peaceful State he steer'd his Course, Addicted more to Flattery than Force; Rul'd like a Prince deserving of a Throne, Making his Subjects Happiness his own, Would hazard neither on uncertain Grounds, But kept both safe within their lawful Bounds; The Rights of King and People knew full well, And scorn'd to give an Inch or take an Ell: Nor was he so averse to War, thro' Fear, As some unread mistakingly averr; For 'twas alone the Wisdom in his Breast, And other Royal Vertues he possest, That made his Crown sit easy and his People blest. Full Twenty Years and Two the Monarch Reign'd, Obey'd, Belov'd and Happy to his End, Leaving the Nation wealthy in a Calm, Beneath the umbrage of the peaceful Palm, Enrich'd with all things that a Land could need, Should Spendthrift-War two saving Reigns succeed, Which just before his Death began to shew Some distant glimm'rings, obvious to his view. The Throne establish'd in its Right of Pow'r, The Subject in his Property secure; The People honest, to Religion bent, The Church in safety, and the Priests content, That when the King resign'd his sov'reign Sway, It seem'd not hard to Govern or Obey. So the wise Parent, e're he dies, takes care To settle all things justly, that his Heir May 'njoy his Right from all Incumbrance free, To th'Honour of his Father's Memory. Nor was the Northern Prince, of whom we treat, Less famous for his Learning than his Wit, Great store of both he worthily possest, Was Wise in earnest, ready at a Jest; Well read in Science, and alike expert In e'ery useful and scholastick Art, Enrich'd by Heaven with superior Sence, Adorn'd with unaffected Eloquence; And as Historians say, and Poets sing, Was a good Scholar, and as good a King; Nor less a Christian, as Records agree, But equally esteem'd for all the Three. No Holy Prince in pious Ages crown'd, Could e'er in moral Vertues more abound; For, tho' a King, he Beauty's Darts defy'd, And still kept constant to his Royal Bride, Gave just Examples to the Nobler Sort, And prov'd the faithfull'st Husband in his Court; A tender Father to his Princely Brood, To all his Servants bountifully Good; Kind to his Subjects, careful of their Ease, And, to his Neighbours round, a Prince of Peace; Discerning to an eminent degree, And wisely guess'd, as if he cou'd foresee; Wanted no Craft, was hard to be deceiv'd, Yet seem'd to credit what he disbeliev'd; And by his mutual Flatt'ry countermin'd The Plots by wheedling Sycophants design'd: Thus by the same dissembling Arts they chose, Unhing'd the Projects of his smiling Foes; For none could better understand than he, The subtil use of serious Flattery. Nor can it be a Crime in Prince or Peer, To do for Safety what they're forc'd to bear, Since servile Flatt'ry, by the Nobler Sort, Is made the Cut-throat Feather of the Court: Besides, by Nature's self-preserving Law, We justly may defend when others draw, And the like Weapon, tho' unlawful, chuse, Which faithless Friends to our Destruction use. Upon the Death of James, the Royal Son Succeeds his Father in the British Throne, To whose unhappy Reign we now proceed, Hard to be sung, and mournful to be read; A Theme, not only stain'd but overflow'd With Factious Gall, and streams of Noble Blood, Fit only for the Muse that can repine At sad Events, and weep at e'ery Line: However, we'll attempt the knotty Task, And shew the Truth without a partial Mask, Not only, in a short and useful way, The various Turns and tragick Scene display, But give the lively Images of all The Leaders who contriv'd the Martyrs Fall, And those who to their own Destruction stood A Loyal Safeguard to the Royal Blood, With their true Characters concisely drawn, From the Arm'd Rebel to the Rev'rend Lawn, That all may in their proper Colours shine With as much Justice as in Clarendine, And the kind Reader, unimpos'd on, see How well their Looks did with their Lives agree; For in the Face judicious Eyes may find The symptoms of a Good or Evil Mind. A.D. 1625. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the First Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1625. No sooner had the best of Kings on Earth Possess'd the British Throne by right of Birth, And from the Gallick Court espous'd a Queen, T'augment the Blessings of his early Reign, But by his Writs, in order to content A feav'rish Land, he call'd a Parliament, Who, tho' they gave their Sov'reign a Supply, To help the Protestants in Germany; Yet when to Oxon they remov'd, to shun The Fury of the Plague that reign'd in Town, When there assembl'd, soon they chang'd their fair Auspicious Looks to a contentious Ayre, And, for redress of Grievance, to postpone The weighty Business of the needy Throne, Early engag'd in an expensive War, To check the Pride of Spain, advanc'd too far, And to repel the German, from the Rhine, Who'd drove out the Elector Palatine, Whose Quarrel, peaceful James, before he clos'd His Eyes, to please the Senate, had espous'd, And at their Intercession sent Supplies, To help the injur'd Protestant Allies: But now, altho' they earnestly had mov'd The Royal Sire to what he ne'er approv'd, And had thereby intail'd upon the Son, The War his Father had but scarce begun, With factious Light'ning, of a sudden fir'd, They would not grant what such a Cause requir'd, Alledging that the Kingdom was betray'd By Evil-Counsel, and the Throne misled; That most of what they'd giv'n had been mispent, And lavish'd by unjust Mismanagement; Charging the whole Misconduct and the Blame Of all upon the Duke of Buckingham, A Noble Peer, who in the Reign before, The Nation as their Safeguard did adore. But Faction always envy those that Rise, And gaze on Fav'rites with distemper'd Eyes. Nor would the Senate chearfully proceed To give the Crown Supplies in time of need, But kept the King's Occasions in suspence, And by absurd Delays provok'd their Prince, A quaint Petition fram'd to let him see The dangerous advance of Popery, And so Religious grew that they besought His Royal Care, but gave him not a Groat, More than already they'd vouchsaf'd to grant, Which prov'd too scanty for the present Want. Thus Faction by their Promissory Baits, Draw Princes first to War, next into Streights; Then, Scriv'ner-like, unlawful Ways devise, To make him pay large Premiums for Supplies. The King to their Petition wisely gave As kind Returns as they could wish to have; But still the House the Crown-Affairs delay'd, And in their Speeches 'gainst the Duke invey'd, Grew daily more insatiate of Demand, Rudely preparing, for the Royal Hand, A shrewd Remonstrance, with a proud intent To blacken both the Duke and Government, That the chief Fav'rite, by the King belov'd, Might from all Trust and Service be remov'd. The common Method factious Spirits take To weaken Kings and make their Empires shake; For he that parts with Friends to please his Foes, To unseen Dangers does himself expose. This the good Prince was wise enough to know, Did therefore early his Resentments show, And rather than admit of that unkind Remonstrance which the stubborn House design'd, Rowz'd up his Princely Courage, and dissolv'd The Senate, tho' the first that e'er he call'd. Thus Feuds in Government beget Neglects, That seldom fail to end in bad Effects. These Jarrs, however, did not yet deter The King from prosecution of the War, Who now with utmost Vigour push'd it on, Tho' at request of Parliament begun: Did speedy Leagues by Embassy obtain, With France, the States-United, and the Dane; In which auspicious Service were employ'd The Fav'rite Duke and Holland's Earl beside This comforted the Germans in distress, And gave their sinking Cause a prosp'rous Face. But outward Looks too oft deceive our Eyes, And by false flatt'ring Signs of Health disguise The dangerous Disease that inward lies. The active Dane, with hopes of Glory warm'd, Early, pursuant to his Contract, arm'd, Look'd big at first, yet nothing did of weight, But prov'd in all Attempts unfortunate. Which he imputed justly to the long Delays of England, who had done him wrong, In not performing what the King had sign'd, Before the Season was too far declin'd, Which was intirely owing to the want Of those Supplies the House refus'd to grant. For costly War, like Law, its countercurse, Can ne'er succeed without a flowing Purse. In Autumn, when each corner of the Sky Began to open, and the Winds blow high, The Fleet was well equipp'd, and by the King Commanded forth, which should have sail'd in Spring, Large was the Complement, and bravely Mann'd With Force sufficient both for Sea and Land, Essex commanding as the Chief at Sea, And Wimbleton by Land the Soldiery; In the Eighth Month, that season of the Year When Mariners tempestuous Weather fear, The gallant Fleet weigh'd Anchor, hoisted Sail, Took their departure with a soothing Gale, And for the Spanish, bid their native Shore farewel. But far they had not plough'd with sturdy Keels, Thro' Liquid Valleys and thro' rowling Hills, E're what they dreaded as the worst of Foes, A sudden Tempest, in their Teeth arose, Whose threat'ning Fury was so fiercely great, That it for seven Days dispers'd the Fleet, Whilst the proud Winds and Surges in the Fray, Together, made one Noble Ship their prey, And added unto Neptune's wealthy Hoard, A Prize with near two hundred Souls aboard. Thus those who Arm, and mighty Deeds propose, Oft meet that ruin they design their Foes. When Providence had quell'd the raging Storm, To save the scatter'd Fleet from further harm, At the South-Cape they join'd their Force again, And, thence departing, steer'd their Course for Spain, Where Essex, fond of some illustrious Deed, In triumph o'er the Main to Cadiz rid, Proposing there to burn the Spanish Fleet, Or do some Action honourably Great; But his Delays and long Debates prepar'd The watchful Foe to stand upon their Guard, That the Land-Forces which their Boats had set On Shore, with dang'rous Opposition met, Whilst a stout Squadron were detach'd and sent T'attack the Puntol-Castle, where they spent Two thousand Shot to no effect, and then Return'd successless to the Fleet again. However, Sir John Burroughs, by Command Of Wimbleton, with chosen Force by Land, Like a brave Leader did the Spaniards beat, And made the Fort, at sight thereof, submit; Beneath whose armed Walls, in Cadiz Bay, Their best Galleons, at first for safety lay, But e're 'twas taken were remov'd from thence Under Port-Royal, stronger of Defence; So that tho' Sir Samuel. Argale did attempt to burn Their Fleet, he did without Success return. Thus great Designs with Disappointments meet, And often fail, tho' back'd with Blood and Sweat. Nor was this all, for now the plund'ring Force Made Matters prove, by their Intemp'rance, worse, Turn'd, by excess of Wine, unruly Sots, And drown'd their strength by their inebrious draughts, Improv'd their feav'rish Surfeits by degrees, To a contagious pestilent Disease; And grew on Shore so headstrong and untow'rd, That, fearing worse, they were embark'd on board, And their Commanders glad to quit the Place, With Honour scarce to ballance the Disgrace. When thus their Cadiz Enterprize had fail'd, From thence unto the Southern Cape they sail'd, Where they lay by for twenty Days compleat, In hopes to meet the rich Peruvian Fleet; But such a fatal Pestilence increas'd, That many dy'd, and left the rest diseas'd, Forcing the Adm'ral in distress to fly His Station e're the wealthy Prize came by, Having scarce Men to hand and manage right The Sails in their return, much less to fight; In case the Fleet a longer stay had made, T'accomplish the Design for which they staid, Till fear of danger, 'twas but wise to shun, Caus'd 'em to quit the Cape four Days too soon; Within which time, when they had left the Place, The floating Treasure did with safety pass. Thus Man projects, but 'tis the guiding Hand Of Providence that rules by Sea and Land. The Fleet returning, after great Expence, With little Honour to themselves or Prince, The King was so provok'd that he refus'd The General his Presence, who accus'd The Earl of Essex, laid on him the blame, But both came off unpunish'd for the same. Thus he that serves, in any place of Trust, His King or Country, tho' he's ne'er so Just, If Heaven frustrates the Design in hand, The Blame devolves on him that bears Command. For e'ery Side, tho' wicked, when at Odds, Still arrogate the Friendship of the Gods; And if they're baulk'd their disappointments owe To the neglect of those they trust below. The Fruits of War, tho' early, now appear'd, And large Supplies were speedily requir'd; The Royal-Treasure spent, and nothing done To please the Crowd or satisfy the Crown; No Senate sitting to consult of Ways And Means how they a needful Sum should raise, That, in this fatal Exigence, the Throne Was forc'd to be supply'd by way of Loan, Borr'wing on Letters sign'd by Privy-Seal, What Sums were wanting of the Commonweal; Wherein the King a punctual Promise made The same in Eighteen Months should be repay'd. These Methods rais'd a gen'ral Discontent, And made the Nation grutch the Coin they lent; Nor could his Friends this way of Loan approve, Tho' stedfast in their Loyalty and Love, Unless the King had in his Wisdom meant By Peace, the only Measures, to prevent The Senate's meeting, which he call'd in haste, Before the Nation's Warmth had time to waste. For to provoke, and then to need their Pow'r, Brings down the Storm that did but low'r. The King, who near eleven Months postpon'd His Coronation, now in Pomp was Feb. 2. Crown'd. Soon after which Solemnity, began The second Senate Feb. 6. of his anxious Reign, Who soon grew high, and prov'd so like the first, None can determine which was best or worst, For their absurd Proceedings were the same, And the Buckingham. Duke's Ruine their industrious Aim; As if they thought by his Remove alone, To make their Way more easy to the Throne, Whose Pow'r they seem'd to threaten by their warm Debates and Cavils that foretold a Storm; And by Delays compell'd their needy Prince To give them fresh Occasions of Offence. Just so the wealthy Niggard, by his bare Allowance, forces his depending Heir To make disgraceful Shifts to ease his Wants, And then upbraids him of Extravagance. Nor did the Parliament alone displease The King, by their Reflections and Delays, But in their Heat to further Mischiefs bent, Committees to the Signet-Office sent, T'examine certain Letters of Reprieve, By which the Pious Prince thought fit to save Some Priests, at th'Intercession of the Queen, Who at the York-Assize condemn'd had been. The prying Senate having no intent In this, but to affront the Government, And by their busy search let People see, How much the Crown encourag'd Popery. Thus when a Kingdom does itself divide, 'Tis but an easy Task for factious Pride To stain the Prince, or black the Loyal Side. The King, tho' much Incens'd, a Message sent By Sir Richard, Chancellor of the Exchequer. Weston, to acquaint the Parliament, The Navy was distress'd for want of Pay, Nor would their present Need admit delay; That forty Sail were ready to set out, But wanting Money could not move without; And that the Army, quarter'd on the Coasts, Were destitute of Victuals and of Cloaths; Desiring therefore they with speed would grant Supplies sufficient for the present Want; But all in vain, for the contentious House Were grown so haughty, peevish, and morose, That still they thought convenient to postpone The hasty Bus'ness of the needy Throne, And into wise Consideration took Turner's A Doctor of Physick very solicitous against the D. of Buckingham. Six Queries 'gainst the Fav'rite Duke, Wherein the Honour of the Throne was stain'd, And the King's Conduct factiously arraign'd, A Liberty few Parliaments before Had ever taken with the Sov'reign Pow'r. This freedom gave encouragement to all The disaffected Clan to vent their Gall, That Speeches now were to Invectives turn'd, And fiery Men let fall what wiser scorn'd. Among the rest, one Clement Cook. Cook, to shew his Zeal, Drop'd some Expressions, which the King took ill; Such that, together with their cross Delays, And warm Proceedings to the Duke's Disgrace, Made Royal Charles send Weston to demand O'th' Senate Satisfaction out of hand, For foul seditious Words that had been spoke Within the House, by Turner and by Cook; But no Inquiry being made so soon As 'twas expected by the Injur'd Throne, The angry Monarch did an Order send, For Lords and Commons jointly to attend, And by the Keeper Succeded Williams, Bishop of Lincoln. Coventry declar'd His Mind, which some with great impatience heard, Touching th'offensive Words that had been said, And no Proceedings tow'rds a Censure made, Complaining of the great dishonour done The King, by their Incroachments on the Crown, In their assuming to themselves the Pow'r Of sending a Committee to look o'er The Signet-Office, where those Secrets lie That only appertain to Majesty, Warmly excusing Buckingham at large, From all the House had laid unto his Charge, Commanding them most strictly to proceed No further upon that ungrateful Head; But like good Subjects to supply with speed, In time of War, the Navy's present need, That then the King would lengthen out their stay, To redress all things in a decent way. But if they still went on as they begun, Their Heats would cause him to dismiss them soon. This Speech was turn'd and constru'd many ways, And in the House did great Emotions raise, Gave fresh Occasion for severe Debates, And rather heighten'd than allay'd their Heats. Thus did the King, the most abus'd of Men, Waste the first annual Circle of his Reign, Which seem'd to threaten, by its early Jars, Rebellious Fractions and domestick Wars, Those Judgments which the angry Gods provide For sinful Nations, to abate their Pride. The End of the First Year. THE Duke of Buckingham's CHARACTER. No gallant Peer, by Nature fram'd to warm The lovely Fair, could boast a nobler Form, True Symmetry in e'ery part was seen, Manly his Face, and awful was his Mien. Nor had the Hand of Heaven prov'd less kind, In richly furnishing his gen'rous Mind, Endow'd with such distinguishable Worth, As suited well his Quality and Birth: Nor did his Greatness, or the Gifts bestow'd Upon him, make him too severe or proud; For none, so high and powerful as he, Could more abound in Affability. No Prince had e'er a more accomplish'd Friend, Loyal, sincere, and faithful to his End, Who did to all Men courteously deport Himself, tho' greatly envy'd by the Court; A fatal Mischief that does often prove The Bane of those wh'ingross their Prince's Love. Much Knowledge did enrich his fruitful Brain, Tho' Books had been his Study less than Men, And might have stood, had he escap'd his Fate, As great a Pillar of the English State, As ever Prince in high Affairs could trust, Or any Reign, without exception, boast. Was bountiful and lib'ral of Expence, Gen'rous to all within his Cognizance; Good to his Kindred, sedulous to raise His meanest Relatives to Pow'r and Place; A grateful Master to his servile Train, Profusely kind, and hospitably vain; And unto whom his Friendship he profess'd, Of faithful Friends was proud to be the best: But prov'd a formidable Foe to all Who with deceitful Smiles disguis'd their Gall. Nor had his moral Vertues any stain, T'eclipse the Glory of so great a Man, Besides a fond pursuit of Female Charms, And Pleasures that he sought in Beauty's Arms: Yet sinn'd with too much Caution to defame The Fair, or bring 'em into publick Shame, By any open Follies that might be A scandal to themselves or Family. Nor could the boldest Hero ever boast A Soul more worthy of the highest Post; For like the hunted Lyon who, to shew His gallant Nature, never flies in view, He still maintain'd his Ground, in spight of Foes, And scorn'd to forfeit Honour for Repose. Tho' had he valu'd Ease and Safety more Than dang'rous Magnanimity and Pow'r, And when accus'd by Parliament of Crimes Had, in some measure, yielded to the Times, He'd pacify'd those Storms that shook the State, And might, perhaps, have met a milder Fate. THE Lord-Keeper Coventry's CHARACTER. Son of a Judge, train'd up to know the Laws, And early skilful in the knotti'st Cause; Whose forward Parts did in his Youth presage The Fame and Glory that adorn'd his Age. Nor did the Goddess Fortune fail to crown The zenith of his Years with great Renown; For by the time he'd travell'd from the Womb, Half our computed Journey to the Tomb, The City chose him, with united Hearts, Recorder, for his Eloquence and Parts. Nor was the Court forgetful to prefer Such Worth, but made him chief Solicitor, Then King's Attorney. Thus, with great Applause, He steer'd his Course unblemish'd thro' the Laws. At length thought worthy to be plac'd more near The Throne, was made Lord-Keeper, then a Peer; Which painful Trust he did so well discharge, And for his just Decrees obtain'd so large A Character, that none, before or since, Could be a greater Honour to his Prince, In doing all things that became so high A Station, guiltless of a Step awry, Making the Prelate who enjoy'd the Seat Before, tho' fam'd for Learning and for Wit, Blush, that a Layman, in so high a Post, Should merit that Esteem a Bishop lost: Whose just Successor took impartial Care, To deal the Cards of Equity so fair, That none could sully his unspotted Name, Or with reproachful Dust eclipse his Fame. No Statesman better understood, than he, The Publick, or his own Security; Nor more exactly knew the Nation's bent Or Genius, in respect to Government; Tho' his Advice was not so much requir'd At Helm, because a greater Fav'rite steer'd; Which pleas'd him well, because he found the more He meddl'd, he should stand the less secure. Full sixteen Winters he the Seal maintain'd, Highly approv'd, unbiass'd and unstain'd; And tho' twice jostl'd, bravely held his own, In spight of Portland and of Hamilton, Who strove to give him a remove, but found That none knew better how to stand his ground; For like a sturdy, tall, well-rooted Oak, That bids defiance to each stormy shock, He baffl'd all his Foes, their Malice crost, And liv'd and dy'd an Honour to his Post, None having made the like remove before, From Bench to Grave, in forty Years or more. A General Character of the House of Commons in the first Parliament, call'd and dissolv'd in the first Year of the King's Reign, An. Dom. 1625. Some thought the Power of the Court was grown Too great, and too exorbitant the Throne; And that preceeding Parliaments had been Too condescending in the former Reign; And, thro' their cool remisness of a just Redress of Grievance, misimploy'd their Trust, And suffer'd the Prerogative thereby, For want of timely Care, to soar too high, Did therefore from the craving Court dissent, To low'r the Pride of Regal Government, And thought it but their Duty to devise Contentious Methods to postpone Supplies. Others there were, who, thro' a vain conceit Of their own Worth, were hasty to be Great, Thinking the readi'st Course that they could steer, Was first at Court to make the Passage clear, By giving a remove to those that lay As Stumbling-blocks and Barriers in their way. This made 'em clamour loudly against those That sate aloft, as if the Nation's Foes, And caus'd 'em to accumulate such Blame Upon the King's chief Fav'rite Buckingham, Who had, 'tis true, ambitiously ingross'd, By favour of the Throne, all Pow'r and Post; For none the Avenues of State could pass, Or rise, but by an Int'rest in His Grace. Which envy'd Greatness made the Duke alone, The Mark of all not hearty to the Throne. For 'tis the Fate of those that sit so high, To bear the blame, if others step awry. Nor is the wisest Government secure From Casualties that may reflect on Pow'r. Therefore 'tis easy to reproach the Great With Faults, and to dishonour those we hate. Among the rest, there was a pious sort Of factious Zealots that oppos'd the Court, Who seem'd inspir'd with a tumultuous fear Of growing Pop'ry, tho' no danger near; And to perplex the Crown would still delay Supplies, and fling Religion in the way, Altho' her wrangling Advocates were known Less fit to guard the Church than pull her down. However, to obtain their factious Ends, They labour'd hard to seem Religion's Friends, And in her Name and Safety still put by, From time to time, the bus'ness of Supply. Thus factious Cunning, when imploy'd to cross The Government, requires a holy Gloss, To blind the weak, and make the Crowd inclin'd To think the worst of Evils well design'd. These, tho' perhaps each sep'rate Party knew, Within themselves, they'd diff'rent Ends in view, Yet all agreed 'twas needful to secure Their Rights by low'ring the monarchick Pow'r, And to remove those Fav'rites from the Prince, Whose tow'ring Greatness gave the House offence. The Court, who saw their drift, by their delay Of Money, grew as obstinate as they. The King resolving, when he found their Aim, To stand his Ground, and stick by Buckingham. This made the Senate trifle with Supplies, And grow upon the Crown's Necessities, Till it became each factious Leader's Sport, To dart their bold Invectives at the Court, And to disturb the King and Kingdom's Peace, With cross Petitions and Remonstrances; Not that their crafty Rancour could diffuse Th'inveterate Disease thro' all the House, For the most mod'rate heartily desir'd To give what e'er their Prince's Wants requir'd; But still the Loyal number prov'd too short To carry on the bus'ness of the Court; So that the King dissolv'd 'em, to prevent Their further Insults of his Government. Thus the first Seeds of Discontent were sown And cherish'd 'twixt the People and the Throne, From whence arose those spightful Heats and Jars, That ended in the Curse of Civil Wars. A.D. 1626. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Second Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1626. The Speech the Keeper to the Senate made, Wherein the Publick Wants were open laid, And all their misbehaviour tow'rds the Throne With decency reprov'd and touch'd upon, Was so ill relish'd that they sent a shrewd Remonstrance, that presag'd the King no good, Fill'd with dissembl'd Thanks and Joy to find His Majesty so gracious and so kind In his Expressions, with sincere intent To shew his great regard to Parliament; Acknowledging that some few words were spoke Within the House unwarily by Cook; For which they'd giv'n him an immediate Check, To manifest their general dislike; Tho' by a clear explaining of his sence, Himself had much abated the Offence; Yet that before this time they should have made Further inquiry into what he'd said, Had not his Majesty a Message sent To th'House that interrupted their intent; And that the like befel them in the Case Of Turner, which occasion'd their Delays. That as for what State-Letters they had read, And searches in the Signet-Office made, Therein they had presum'd to do no more Than other Parliaments had done before: All which they humbly hop'd was no Offence, Since warranted by divers Precedents. Touching the Duke, and what they'd done therein, They beg'd the King to be inform'd 't'ad been The ancient Right, and the undoubted Use Of Parliaments, to question and accuse Such Persons as the House conceiv'd to be In fault, tho' ne'er so high in Quality; Not doubting but the Measures they should take, Relating to the Duke, in time would make The Kingdom safer, and restore the Crown To all its ancient Honour and Renown. But, lastly, as to matter of Supply, They own'd themselves unwilling to deny What should be needful, might they be allow'd Some few Additions for the Nation's good, Which they were then consulting, and would be Of Service also to His Majesty, To whom they'd give, if he'd vouchsafe to join With them, and not to frustrate their Design, Such suitable Supplies that, well bestow'd, Should make him Safe at Home and Great Abroad. To which deceitful Cant the King, in short, Reply'd, that Matters of the most import Ought first to be dispatch'd, does then profess They should have time for bus'ness of Redress, Yet like spurr'd Jades they flounc'd the backward way, And slighted all that Majesty could say, No notice of his Royal Answer took, But still proceeded warmly with the Duke, 'Gainst whom the Earl of Bristol in the House Of Lords, did all his utmost Rancour use, Contributing, tho' noxious to the Crown, What e'er he could to pull the Fav'rite down. Thus when aspiring Faction find their Strength, 'Tis hard to stop 'em till they've run their length. The Earl aforesaid, in the Father's Reign, Having, for some Mismanagements in Ambassador in Spain. Spain, Been banish'd from the Presence of the Throne, Remain'd secluded by the Royal Son; But being now importunate to sit In Parliament, petition'd for his Writ Of Summons, That whereas he'd been restrain'd Above two Years, and of no Crime arraign'd, He might b'admitted to the House, and there Enjoy the ancient Priv'lege of a Peer; And that he might in Parliament be try'd, In case a Charge should be exhibited. The Writ was sent him at the Lords request, But with the Keeper's Letter, which express'd 'Twas the King's Pleasure that he should content Himself, as yet, beneath the same Restraint, In the Lords House presume not to appear, Or give his personal Attendance there. This, the hot Earl, to make the King amends, To th'upper House, with a Petition sends, Shewing how far such Practises as these Intrench'd upon their Rights and Liberties; For that the Letter missive to command His Absence, was without the Royal Hand, Humbly beseeching that he might be heard, As to those Points of Hardship he'd prefer'd; Also what Blame he had to charge upon His Grace the Duke, relating to the Throne. These Overtures allarm'd the Fav'rite Duke, Who soon resolv'd, and speedy Measures took To stop the Progress that the Earl had made, And baffle his Design in Malice laid; Accordingly does with the King prevail, To order the Attorney-General, Forthwith to summon Bristol to appear As a Delinquent at the upper-Bar, Where the Attorney did in brief acquaint Their Lordships, as they sate in Parliament, That he was come in order to accuse The Earl of Treason at the Bar o'th' House; And when he'd spoke, pursuant to the Rules Of Law, exhibited his Articles In number Eleven.; But the Earl nimbly, e're the same were read, Apply'd unto the Lords, and thus he said, My Lords, I am a Freeman and a Peer, As yet untainted, therefore beg you'll hear What I've to offer, knowing it must be Of use and service to His Majesty. No sooner had their Lordships prov'd so kind To give him leave, and bid him speak his Mind, But in return the Earl accus'd his Grace Of the like Crime, as sitting in his Place, Humbly presenting, to encrease the Storm, Twelve Articles against the Duke, in Form. Thus, that he might the same Disgrace incur, Gave him a Rowland for his Oliver. The Lords, however, after they had read The Articles 'gainst both exhibited, Neither containing what the Law could make High-Treason, tho' the words were foul and black, Committed Bristol to the Usher's Care And Custody, resolving to prefer Th'Attorney-Gen'ral's Charge, and to postpone The Earl's against the Duke, to please the Throne; A Favour which the King esteem'd as kind, Altho' but superficially design'd; For few Proceedings by the Lords were made, But on th'account of Prejudice delay'd, Finding but little more on either part Than mutual Envy, blacken'd o'er with Art: So that their Feuds, which to such height arose, Only made Sport and Pastime for their Foes. Thus when the bick'rings and contentious Spight O'th' Great, are found for Justice Scales too light, They please their Enemies, disgust their Friends, And in Disgrace their fruitless Quarrel ends. But the Duke finding that the Lords forsook The Contest, and but little notice took To call back Bristol's Cause, made some effort, In hopes to try it in the King's Bench. Regal Court. These Male-endeavours did the Peers inflame, Who gave Five Reasons to oppose the same. First, That the Earl, by th'rigour of the Laws, Could there b' allow'd no Counsel in his Cause. Secondly, That no Witness could he bring To serve him upon Tryal 'gainst the King. Thirdly, He could not know the Evidence Against him, to prepare for his Defence. Fourthly, That such new Practices would be A great infringement of their Liberty. Fifthly, That if indicted at the Bar Of the King's-Bench, the House could not defer Or stop the Earl's Arraignment, till he'd made The Accusation good which he had laid Against the Duke, for when Attainted, none Their Evidence could give to serve the Throne; Insisting, That the Fact should first be clear'd, Before the House, and Witnesses be heard, E're the Earl's Cause was to the Bench refer'd. Thus did the Lords discreetly over-rule Their mutual Heat, and gave 'em time to cool. Soon after this, the Lower-House, to make The Duke, their only Mark, appear more black, Sent up Eight Members Sir Dudley Diggs, Sir John Elyot, Mr. Selden, Mr. Glanvil, Mr. Pym, Mr. Wansfort, Mr. Herbert, Mr. Sherland. to the Lords to charge His Grace with Misdemeanors more at large, Containing thirteen Articles of great Offences and Mismanagements of State, Tho' all amounted to no more than what Would in another scarce be deem'd a Fau't. However, he a timely Answer made, With so much taking Modesty inlaid, That many who presag'd a proud Defence, From one of so much Pow'r and Prevalence, Were so converted that he wisely us'd A Style so soft and humble, when accus'd, That they forsook the Prejudice they bore, And chang'd th'Opinion they maintain'd before. Thus those that sit at Helm are oft bely'd, And falsly represented till they're try'd. Nor did the Charge against the Duke contain More than some Failings in the former Reign; Which Fact, altho' 't'ad been more clear and full, Could not be legally cognoscible: However, to be safe, His Grace thought fit, Submissively to claim the benefit Of two effectual gracious Pardons, one Granted by James, the other by his Son. But these b'ing humble Methods, which the House Expected that the Duke would scorn to use, The angry Faction would not quit their Scent, But still pursu'd their Game, and on they went, Like a stanch Pack were furious in their Chase, And shew'd their eager Nature in their Pace, Drawing a Declaration to succeed Their black'ning Charge, which with the same agreed, And caus'd it with unwearied Pains to be Prefer'd before a Bill of Subsidy, Which lay prepar'd, in order to be read, But, to make way for Malice, was delay'd. For with aspiring Faction 'tis a Rule, To ne'er give spightful Envy time to cool. This usage, when the publick Wants were great, At an ill time perplex'd the needy State, And disoblig'd the King to that degree, That, in return, His injur'd Majesty, Next Day, by a Commission seal'd and sent To certain Lords, dissolv'd the Parliament. Thus was the Throne compel'd to stop the course Of present Mischiefs, by endang'ring worse. As bold Physicians, for immediate Ease, Administer destructive Remedies. For all these hasty Measures prov'd no more Than ling'ring Poysons to the Sov'reign Pow'r. No sooner was the angry Monarch freed From those who play'd upon his pressing need, But to encrease his Cares, and make the weight Of all his early Troubles still more great, The Priests and French Domesticks of the Queen Were grown, at Court, so insolent and vain, That for Indignities they'd put upon The King, to the dishonour of the Throne, And other freedoms they presum'd to take, His Majesty was forc'd to send 'em back, That a worse living, in their native Clime, Might punish each Offender for his Crime. The Gallick Court took this in great disdain, Tho' the French King had done the like by Spain. But knowing well the fatal Discontent Between the English Crown and Parliament, That at this time his Royal Neighbour stood On sorry Terms at home, and worse abroad; 'Twas therefore speedily resolv'd by France, To take advantage of his present Wants; Accordingly they seiz'd and made a Prey Of th'English Shipping that at Bourdeaux lay, To th'unforeseen irreparable Wrong Of Merchants here, to whom they did belong: So that the feeble Peace patch'd up before, Was, of a sudden, turn'd to open War; Which now oblig'd the King to change his course, At an ill time, and to employ the Force Against the French, which he had just prepar'd For Cadiz, to attack the Spaniard. B'ing now injoin'd to answer the Desires Of the oppress'd and injur'd Rochellers, Who 'mplor'd the King to succour 'em from hence, And give them his Protection and Defence: But want of Money still the Fleet withheld, Till past St. Michael's Day before they sail'd; A time when stormy Winds began to blow, And European Seas tempestuous grow, That e're the high tremendous threatning Waves, Which swell'd like mighty Hills, and gap'd like Graves, The floating Bulwarks half their way had born, They all were forc'd, much shatter'd, to return, Shewing no more than that the King's intent To succour Rochel was sincerely meant. Thus humane Wisdom only can design, But all Success depends upon Divine. Whilst the two Kings were fanning this new flame, Bad Tidings from abroad to England came, Importing, that the Dane had been o'erthrown By Tilly, and must shortly be undone, Unless the British Government convey'd Sufficient Succours timely to his Aid; That lest the Enemy's Designs were crost, The Sound would of necessity be lost; That th'English Garison at Stoad was close Besieg'd, and must surrender to their Foes; That the old Hambrough Staple, we enjoy'd, And Eastland Trade, would be of course destroy'd. These fatal Mischiefs falling just upon That crowd of Troubles that begirt the Throne, The pensive King was much perplex'd to find His Wants so great, and Fortune so unkind; Nor would this unexpected Exigent Admit of time to call a Parliament, To raise Supplies by ordinary Means, T'enable him to change these frightful Scenes. His Privy-Council therefore did agree, That as the House had pass'd a Subsidy, Tho' the Bill had not been so often read, In Form, as those that are consummated, Yet since the Senate was dissolv'd before 'T'ad pass'd the Sanction of the Sov'reign Pow'r, The King, on such Occasions, might demand The payment of the same throughout the Land; Not as a Subsidy, but by the way Of Loan, which the next Parliament should pay, Or pass an Act that subsequently shou'd Confirm the same, and make the Levy good. Th'unhappy King, much streighten'd for Supplies, Was forc'd to take their hazardous Advice; Accordingly Commissions pass'd the Seal, Directed to the chief o'th' Commonweal, By which they strictly were requir'd with speed, To Levy Moneys for the present Need. And that each Person, authoriz'd thereby, On these Instructions foll'wing should rely. That all Commissioners should tender down Their several Sums required by the Crown, T'encourage others to pursue the good Example which their Betters freely shew'd. That all Assessments truly do agree With the old Books of the last Subsidy. That they declare the Reasons of the Loan, And by Perswasions spur the People on, That e'ery one may freely do his part, And send his Money with a chearful Heart. That all Commissioners take care to raise Their sev'ral Levies within fourteen Days. That they shall treat with e'ery one apart, To stifle the Objections some may start. That they begin with such as they believe Will good Examples to their Neighbours give. That they endeavour to discover those Who shall by secret Means the Loan oppose; And that they to the Council certify, Their Habitations, Names, and Quality. That the Benevolence desir'd of late, Upon the Privy-Seals, to serve the State, Should be remitted unto all, upon Their chearful payment of the present Loan; And that the same be signify'd to be The Will and Pleasure of His Majesty. That no appeal b' admitted to abate Any Assessment by the former Rate. That none, upon th'Allegiance that they owe His Majesty, do these Instructions show, But keep 'em secret, and observe the same, In doing which they should incur no Blame. Besides this bie Advice, they were to press The present State of Rochel in Distress, Closely invested by the Duke of Guise, And must be sack'd by Popish Enemies, In case some speedy Succours were not sent From hence, that might their wretched Fate prevent. Thus was the King, amidst a stormy drift Of weighty Cares and Troubles, forc'd to shift; Which shews, that Thrones, as well as low Degrees, Are not without tormenting Stings to tease Their Pomp and ballance their Felicities. Nor did this Project go so smoothly on As hop'd, for tho' it greatly serv'd the Throne, Yet many would not with the Loan comply, Of which Opponents some were Quality, Suff'ring themselves to be to Prison sent, Much rather than supply the Government, Thinking the Nation, by the Measures us'd, Against the Law, much injur'd and abus'd. But yet 'tis hard that Subjects, who expect The Prince should their Estates and Lives protect, Should, at a time of need, controul his Pow'r, And stop the Means by which they're made secure. The End of the Second Year. THE Earl of Bristol's CHARACTER. Thoughtful, yet active, vigorous and brave, Noble his Presence, and his Aspect grave, Of long Experience in Affairs of State, Well qualify'd in all things to be Great. Comely his outward Person, richly lin'd With all the Graces of a Gen'rous Mind; And, before thirty, in the former Reign, Discharg'd a weighty Ambassy in Spain, That what kind Nature's Hand so well had wrought, By Travel, Men, and Books together taught, Were early to a great Perfection brought. None could have more Sagacity to Rule That Wit and Worth of which his Soul was full; For to the World his wise Deportment show'd, The Talents he enjoy'd were well bestow'd; Nor did he want the Umbrage of the Throne, When James the Peaceful wore the British Crown; For he was made, in that wise Monarch's Reign, Earl, Privy-Council, and Vice-Chamberlain; And to confirm his Conduct still the more, Was seven times abroad Embassador; Yet all could not secure him from the Fate That does so oft devolve upon the Great; For Buckingham, who'd gain'd a better share, Both in King James and in His Royal Heir, Secur'd their Favour to himself alone, And render'd Bristol faithless to the Throne, Causing the King in Anger to restrain The Earl, upon his last return from Spain: From hence such Animosities arose, That made 'em to each other dang'rous Foes: Nor would King Charles, when he the Scepter sway'd, Forgive him, when the Rival Duke was dead, But kept him in Disgrace, as if he thought The Spight of one had t'other's Ruin wrought. These Slights provok'd th'aspiring Earl to close With all that did the Court-Affairs oppose, Till finding that their Fury ran too high, And then grew more considerate and shy, Wisely declining their destructive Ways, When once he saw that their Designs were base, Running quite counter to preserve the State, Till made the only object of their Hate. For he that sides with those that force the Laws, Incurrs their Malice if he once withdraws. This generous Retreat oblig'd the King, Who did the Earl once more to Favour bring, Restor'd him in the Houshold to his Place, And with new Friendships wip'd off his Disgrace. Call'd him to Council, where his warmth appear'd, So great, it caus'd him to be less rever'd: Nor could his Zeal forbear to give a loose To's supercilious Passion in the House, Which once provok'd 'em to exert their Pow'r, And send him, for that Error, to the Tow'r; Tho' in those Times, his Heat, as most agree, Was owing to his Age and Loyalty; So that his warmth against the Nation's Foes, 'Twixt Vertue and Infirmity arose: Tho' once misled by Envy and Disgust, Yet none, at length, was to the King more just, At York, Edge-hill, and Oxford he obey'd His Royal Pleasure and procur'd him Aid. And when the War determin'd, was abhorr'd So much by those that govern'd by the Sword, That they'd not suff'r him to survive their Hate In England, or compound for his Estate; A Favour shewn to others of the Court, From whom they had receiv'd much greater hurt; But forc'd him, by their base Tyrannick Pow'r, To waste his Days upon the Gallick Shore, Where, in close Solitude, he liv'd sedate, Till Death reliev'd him of his banish'd Fate. These are the Rods with which the Pow'r supreme, Chastise the Great, that Vertue may esteem All humane Grandure but a worthless Dream. The Lord Bacon's CHARACTER. Of middle Stature, and of comely Mien, His Aspect grave, sagacious and serene, Not only read in just Astrea's Rules, But skill'd in all the Learning of the Schools, To whose commanding Pen we owe the best Of Hist'ry Harry the Seventh. that in English e'er was dress'd, True Natural Philosophy, Essays, And other Books, to his immortal praise; Yet all his Knowledge could not bind his Hands From odious Brib'ry and unjust Demands, Till for such impious Practises as these, He lost, at once, his Honour and his Ease, Was, to his Horror, Ruin, and Disgrace, Render'd incapable of Pow'r and Place; And tho' his Parts, which were profoundly great, Had rais'd him up to such a height of State, Yet, without Pity, was he cast away, Like a crack'd Vessel made of worthless Clay, Despis'd by all Men for the gross abuse Of Pow'r, and slighted as unfit for use, None mourning his declension from so high A Seat, but those who were undone thereby: Nor was the publick Odium he incurr'd, The only shameful Sorrow he endur'd, But the large Summs and num'rous Debts he ow'd, Added to Poverty, improv'd the Load, And made him glad, for Safety, to confine Himself within the Limits of Gray's-Inn, Where, for some Years, in Solitude he dwelt, Wasting beneath those Conflicts that he felt, Till Death, the wretched Mortal's only Friend, To all his Cares and Suff'rings put an end. When thus the Great, the Opulent, or Proud, By Steps awry fall level with the Crowd, Their Parts which were before with Honour crown'd, Are in the depth of their Misfortunes drown'd, And even those despise 'em who before, For their own lucre, did their Pomp adore. Therefore let none ambitious be of Trust, But such as know they can in Pow'r be Just, Lest thro' misguidance 'tis their wretched Fate, By tow'ring high, to make their Fall more great. The General Character of the House of Commons in the Second Parliament, call'd in the First, and dissolv'd in the Second Year of the King's Reign. Tho' the K's. Friends had by their Int'rest sway'd Some Counties, and a few good Changes made, And many Members were intirely firm, Couragious, active, diligent and warm; Yet had the Faction taken equal Pains To ballance those with Men of Tongues and Brains, And to encrease their Party all they cou'd, That the King's Business might be still withstood; And wheresoe'er they'd Power to contend, No Labour spar'd to introduce a Friend, By Int'rest drawn, or Education bent To ruffle and oppose the Government, Men who were bold enough to rail and prate Against the dark Mismanagements of State, And wanted not the Cunning to devise New Rubs and Projects to retard Supplies: So that the King, and Duke, did, in the main, By th'Dissolution, no Advantage gain; For the impatient Faction still pursu'd Their former Scheme, and made their Party good; And when the Bill of Subsidy came on, Had always some fresh Quarrel with the Throne, About the Duke, the common Mark or Butt, At which their Bolts continually were shot, Tho', thro' his Sides, it was their Aim to wound That Pow'r their Fury did at length confound: Nor would they be prevail'd upon to ease The lab'ring Throne of its Necessities, But still preferr'd their own ill-natur'd Wars Against the Duke, before the Crown's Affairs: So that when Royal Patience oft had try'd The House, in vain, and could not be supply'd, Tho' in great Want, and many Cares involv'd, The Senate, by Commission, he dissolv'd, And rather heighten'd, by his over-haste, Those growing Jars that prov'd his Bane at last. For publick Mischiefs, by a stubborn Course, Altho' but just, are oftentimes made worse. A.D. 1627. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Third Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1627. Tho' Money, by the late Commissions, flow'd Not in so fast as 'twas believ'd it wou'd, The Fav'rite Duke intrusted with the great Command of Lord High Adm'ral o'er the Fleet, B'ing now intent to wipe away those Stains His Fame had suffer'd by his Negligence, Had, notwithstanding, fix'd the Naval Force, Consisting of Six Thousand Foot and Horse, With whom the gallant Hero put to Sea, In June 27th., from Portsmouth, for the Isle of Rhee by Rochel., Commanding ten stout Royal Ships, design'd Against the French, with ninety Transports join'd, Arriving soon at the intended Place, All safe beneath the Conduct of His Grace, Who caus'd his Manifesto to be spread On the 21st of July., Importing, He was thither sent to aid And succour the distressed Protestants, Against the Popish Tyranny of France. Toiras, the French Commander in the Isle, Who govern'd there St. Martin's Citadel, A Tow'r of strength, well Garison'd beside, With all things needful for Defence supply'd, Having soon notice of the Foes intent To Land, a thousand Foot and Horse he sent, T'oppose their Landing with their utmost Pow'r, Or warmly give 'em Welcome when on Shore: But these by Four brave English Sir John Burroughs, Sir Alexander Brett, Sir Edward Conway, Sir Charles Rich, with 12000 Men. Knights were met With greater Force, inur'd to Blood and Sweat, Who, under cover of their Guns on board, Had made good their Descent, and stood prepar'd To try the Valour of the Sons of France, Who, without boggling, made a brisk advance; Both sides with equal Brav'ry falling on, As if to Fear they were alike unknown, And that they thought in Battle there could be No Death so bad as loss of Victory, Their mutual Courage making the Dispute, Tho' short, extreamly bloody and acute; Nor did the Vict'ry, tho' they toil'd so hard, The gallant Pains of either side reward; But, tir'd with Slaughter, those that did remain Withdrew, t'inter the numbers that were slain, Among which bleeding heaps that Day were kill'd Many as brave as ever grac'd the Field, Knights, Voluntiers, and Officers of Worth, Too num'rous here to be at large set forth, Whose Names in the Records of Fame have place, In honour to their now surviving Race. The Duke much weaken'd by this warm Dispute, To Rochel sent with speed for a Recruit, His Agents soon returning to his Aid, With Foot, whose Body full five hundred made, Finding His Grace, who thought himself most wise, Repugnant to his Council's safe Advice, Before St. Martin's Fort, the strongest Hold In all the Isle, commanded by a bold Experienc'd Officer, intirely skill'd In the defence of Castle, Town, or Field. However, by the Orders that his Grace Had giv'n the Shipping to surround the Place, And cut off all Provision and Supply Of Ammunition from the Enemy, The num'rous Garison were soon distress'd, And so remain'd for two whole Months at least; Within which tedious space a second hot And furious Battle 'twixt the Foes was fought, Which ended as before, that neither Host Could either Vict'ry or Advantage boast. At length the Corn was in the Castle spent, And no fresh Succours likely to be sent, The Soldiers sparingly compell'd to feed Upon their last Reserve of Bisket-bread, Which could not, with good Husbandry, support, Above ten Days, the number in the Fort, Yet hardy Toiras Governour., resolutely Brave, Reply'd, when Buckingham a Summons gave For him to yield, That he was still too Just, To break or falsify so large a Trust. How great is Honour in so bold a Man, Who values Fame above his vital Span. By this time fresh Auxiliaries were sent To th'English Forces by the Government, And new Devices were advanc'd to storm The Castle, but their Projects did no harm; For those destructive Engines they design'd Were render'd useless by the Waves and Wind; So that no other Measures could be wrought, But to Blockade 'em round and starve 'em out, The Duke concluding that they must, e'relong, Thro' Want surrender, tho' the Place was strong. Knowing the Bravest are with Ease subdu'd, 'Twixt craving Hunger and despair of Food. But wav'ring Fortune, who has sundry Ways To disappoint the Pow'rful of Success, And is as often of her Bounty free, To Wretches in the last Extremity, Favour'd the Castle with a dozen Boats, Laden with Stores to ease their craving Throats, Sent by an Abbot Marscilane. to supply their Need, And by one Valin cunningly convey'd. This chang'd the Scene, and now the English stood In want of Succour, when the French had Food, And scarcity of Bread afflicted those Who proudly triumph'd, hoping in the close, To take Advantage of their starving Foes; But Providence was pleas'd to turn the Tide, And force Necessity to change her side. Burroughs Sir John., a skilful Officer of Note, In viewing of the Works receiv'd a Shot, Of which he dy'd lamented much by all The English Force, discourag'd by his Fall; For he had oft in open Action been, And never fail'd of being Brave therein. The King of France, attended with a great Resort of Nobles, came from Court in State To view his Camp, attempting, in ten Days, Three times to succour the Invested Place, But still their Ships, in spight of all their Care, Were driven back by English Men of War, That round the Isle in several Stations lay, To keep Supplies from coming in that way; So that the Castle having spent their Store, Were now in greater Hardships than before, Toiras resolving, as a means to win The Patience of the Soldiery within, Forthwith to beat a Parley, and to Treat, As his last Shift, with Buckingham the Great, The safest way to keep the Soldiers free, Beneath their pressing Wants, from Mutiny, Hoping that, in the int'rim, some Supplies Of Stores might providentially arise: Accordingly the wish'd for Blessing came In time, to save the Fort and raise his Fame, For skilful Pilots were imploy'd to sound Some dang'rous Shelves, where they a Passage found, Thro' which, befriended by a Winter's Night, Hazie and long, without a spark of Light, They undiscover'd Pilotted a Fleet Of thirty five small Ships, with Stores replete, Three hundred Soldiers to recruit the Fort, Hail chosen Fellows of the abler sort, With half as many Mariners, or more, Skill'd in the Soundings of a dang'rous Shore, Many brave Officers of High Degree, And Eightscore of the Chief Nobility; All safely landed, by the Art and Care Of Manpaile A Famous Pilot of France., Pilot in this Grand Affair. So that when Buckingham thought all things well, And doubted not to win the Citadel, The Soldiers from the Rampiers of the Fort, Shew'd 'em their Turkies and their Fowls, in sport, Shaking the same upon their Pikes and Spears, To brave their Foes, and turn their Hopes to Fears. Thus those who starv'd, to lengthen out their Store, And pin'd for due Support, few Hours before, Reviv'd by Plenty, the Besiegers scorn'd, And were from drooping Slaves to Heroes turn'd. The Duke dismay'd at this unwelcome sight, In Council spent the whole succeeding Night, Where 'twas determin'd he with speed should raise The Siege, draw off, and wholly quit the Place; But Dolbiers just arriving with the News Of fresh Recruits, which did the Duke amuse, And Rochel sending Messengers to pray His Grace would fav'r 'em with a longer stay: 'Twixt both he alter'd his intended Course, And chang'd his Resolution for the worse. During which time the Fame of our Supplies Had reach'd the French and giv'n 'em some surprise, That now they sent a second Fleet Fifteen Sail. with Stores And Men, to give St. Martin's greater force; Besides some Boats and Vessels Seven. to support Another Castle call'd the Meadow-Fort: And then the King of France resolv'd, before The Earl of Holland with Recruits came o'er, To send a Force sufficient to expel, By dint of Sword, the English off the Isle, Accordingly dispatch'd an Army o'er, From his main Camp, unto the Rheean Shore, Consisting, as Historians do compute, Of Horse two hundred, twice two thousand Foot; Besides a Train of brisk young Voluntiers, Spur'd by the Fury of their greener Years, To shew their youthful Heat, Commanded all By Marshal Schomberg, as their General. The next chief Officer a gallant Man, Of great Experience, Monsieur Marylan Lieutenant-General.: To these in Crowds the Island Natives came, With gladness join'd 'em, the Besieg'd the same, Encreasing soon the number of their Force, To full eleven thousand Foot and Horse, Besides eight hundred of the King's Life-Guard, Who quickly after were dispatch'd on Board, Thrice fifty Country Voluntiers unknown, And thirty Horse belonging to the Crown, All safely Landing under the Defence Of Meadow-Fort; but in their March from thence The Duke attack'd 'em with five hundred Foot And forty Horse, who gave 'em a salute, With so much Brav'ry, that, to shun their Fire, The French did to the Fort again retire; To Monsieur Bossompiere and Haliere's shame, The two, who did in chief Command the same. But when the Duke return'd, he found the French Within his Camp, grown Masters of a Trench: But since the Party who had play'd their Game So well behind the Back of Buckingham, Were not too strong to be dislodg'd by them They had outwitted by a Stratagem, Stanley was order'd by His Grace t'attack The Party warmly, and to force 'em back; But they retir'd by very slow degrees, And lost by Inches what they gain'd with ease, The Lord Montjoy, to ballance this bad Luck, Met a French Party, whom he fought and took; By whose Retreat he'd been almost betray'd Into a strong and dang'rous Ambuscade; But by good Fortune, e're decoy'd too near, Made the Trepanners Prisoners of War. Thus bloody Schemes and barbarous Intents, Are punish'd oft by opposite Events. But Chance, to over-turn this small Success, Soon added fresh Discomfort to His Grace, For a large English Party on the Scout, As in the depth of Night they rang'd about, Fell in, i'th' dark, as marching to and fro, With a superior Party of the Foe, Who being near their Lines, and not a Light Of Heav'n to favour the Nocturnal Fight, The English, by the French, were all decoy'd Into their Camp, made Pris'ners, or destroy'd. Thus fickle Fortune, who regards no Cause, If kind a while, her Favour soon withdraws, And, for her Pastime, takes a cruel Pride, In doubtful War, to often change her Side. Nor did the English only want Success, But starving Sickness heighten'd their Distress, That, viewing these Calamities, the Duke A sudden final Resolution took To quit the Island, as the safest Course, Lest longer stay should make the End but worse, First undertaking, as a bold Farewel, One more Assault upon the Citadel, Which Toiras understanding, had prepar'd The Fort, as well, to stand upon their Guard, That in the rash Attempt, amidst their Toils, The poor Assailants fell in Ranks and Files, And in such slaughter'd Numbers lay before The pelting Castle, welt'ring in their Gore, That when the Duke beheld the Loss so great And fruitless, he commanded a Retreat, Level'd his Dikes and Trenches by degrees, Demollishing his Works and Batteries, Bury'd his Dead, and drew off the remains, That future Safety might reward their Pains: But Marylane and Schomberg follow'd near, To take Advantage of the English Rear, Their Forces brandishing their Swords in scorn, And hall'wing to provoke their Foes return; Which daring Insults caus'd the Duke to stay, And draw his Troops into Batalia; But then the French Bravado's made a halt, Not caring yet to hazard an Assault, Knowing their own Advantage would be great, Before the Foe could make a safe Retreat. So Cowards, tho' superior, always seek, By Wiles, to overthrow the Brave, tho' weak. The Duke now finding that their Challenge prov'd But Froth, in military Order mov'd, Till he advanc'd to Curda, where he made Another stand, and plac'd an Ambuscade Behind some Ruins for the purpose fit, Forcing the French to make a small Retreat. From thence he forward mov'd to Anserine, Where Sloughs and Ditches did his Troops confine Upon a Causway, where the shatter'd Host Could march but five or six a Breast at most. And now the French, who tho' they'd made a feint, Recov'ring their pursuit, with an intent To take advantage of this fatal Place, Thro' which they knew the Enemy must pass, Attack'd the English Forces in the Rear, Upon the Causway, with so fierce a Fire, That Montjoy's Troops, unable to endure Their Charge, turn'd Tail, to be the more secure, And breaking in upon their other Ranks, Confus'd the rest, between the Dikes and Banks, Leaving their Leader, who disdain'd to fly, To become Pris'ner to the Enemy: But Cunningham's bold Horse much rather chose To face, than turn their Backs upon their Foes, Resolving all to make the best Defence They could, in such a dang'rous Exigence; Accordingly they bravely stood their Shot, And, to the last, with matchless Courage fought, Of which they gave a memorable Proof, And perish'd Inch by Inch till all cut off. The rest much shatter'd by a close pursuit, Some kill'd by Ball, and some to pieces cut, Whilst numbers lay confus'dly overthrown In Sloughs and Ditches, fated there to drown: Others who saw the pressing Danger nigh, Did to a distant Bridge for safety fly, Which narrow Pass, with toil and hazard gain'd, Like gallant Souls, they manfully maintain'd, Repuls'd the Foe, tho' half their Troops were lost, And kept, all Day, their advantagious Post, Firing the Bridge, when dusky Night came on, And lodg'd in scatter'd Parties up and down. Thus, for the Pride of Nations, do the Brave, With bleeding Numbers feed the gaping Grave. The Duke, next Day, did, by Demand, obtain, Of the proud Foe, the Bodies of the Slain, Consisting of two thousand Foot and Horse, Besides which slaughter, fifty Officers, Forty four Colours lost in the Dispute, And thirty Pris'ners, Men of Worth and Note: Which sanguinary Action only cost The adverse Side, three hundred Men at most, Since Kings and Kingdoms overgrown with Pride, By bleeding Crowds their Causes must decide. How blest are they, not pointed out by Fate, To perish in the Quarrels of the Great. The Duke, when the Survivers had interr'd Their Dead, commanded all his Troops on board, And hoisting Sail forsook the fatal Place, Where he had barter'd Honour for Disgrace; But in his Passage to his Native Shore, Met Holland with fresh Succours coming o'er; But his Endeavours proving much too late, The Heroes both return'd unfortunate; As if their Stars did mutually agree, Their Crosses in this great Affair should be Ill Omens of their future Destiny. However, tho' the Duke brought little more Than Life to boast of from the Gallick Shore, The King receiv'd him with as kind an Air, As if Success had crown'd his distant Care, Well knowing all Affairs beneath the Skies, Are guided by a greater Pow'r than his. The Duke alledging, had Supplies been sent In time, they might have cross'd the ill Event, Charging his Losses, and the Army's Fate, On his Friend Holland's setting out too late. Thus Honour, rather than endure Disgrace, Will tack about and fly in Friendship's Face. At Sea the King's Affairs went better far, And gave some Life and Credit to the War, There the Vice-Adm'ral Sir John Pennington., by a lucky Chance, Took thirty four rich Merchant Ships of France, All homewards bound, and brought the wealthy Prize To England, stow'd with rich Commodities. And Trettor, at the Texel, by the Shore, Seiz'd a French Ship, of fifty Guns, or more, For Ballast, twelve great Ordinance supply'd The Hold, eleven hundred Arms beside, And eighteen Barrels of that curs'd Device, By which whole Armies perish in a trice. But still this happy News brought home from Sea, Made not amends for the Defeat at Rhee; Nor did it in the least abate the Blame The grumbling Faction charg'd on Buckingham. Yet in no measure did the King reflect Upon the Duke's Misconduct or Neglect, But to reward his unsuccessful Toils, Still ballanc'd his ill-fortune with his Smiles. Abbot, Archbishop, during this Descent, Being Suspended by the Government, The Jurisdiction Metropolitan, By Letters-Patent was conferr'd upon The Lords of London, Durham, Rochester, Oxford, and Bath and Wells, or any four, Or two of them, for Reasons only known To Sov'reign Pow'r, and those about the Throne, Tho' 'twas suppos'd the Primate's want of Care Had made the Nonconformists what they were, Therefore remov'd, and to his House at Ford Confin'd a while, that such might be impow'rd, Who would by some severer Methods try To low'r the Pride of those he'd rais'd so high. Now great Debates in the King's-Bench arose, Between the Lawyers, on behalf of those Committed for non-payment of the Loan, And the King's Council to defend the Crown. One side maintain'd a Habeas Corpus ought To be allow'd, the other argu'd not: Nor would the Judges the Delinquents heed, But with the Council for the Crown agreed; So that the Pris'ners could have no redress, But waited till a General Release. This was a mighty Thorn that gaul'd the Side Of Faction, and inflam'd their peevish Pride. The French encourag'd by their late Success, Resolv'd to now put Rochel in Distress, Laid closer Siege, rais'd Batteries and Forts, And terrifying Works of sundry sorts, With Merchants Vessels cross the River made An artful and a pow'rful Barracade, A thousand and four hundred Yards in length, With Cables link'd, and well contriv'd for strength. To intercept and keep the Channel free From timely Succours coming in by Sea, That now the Rochellers began to fear Their Cause was sinking and their Ruin near, Except the English Throne, before too late, Would use some Measures to divert their Fate; Accordingly their Deputies they sent, To press the King in this sad Exigent, To send 'em speedy Succours to secure A wretched People from a Tyrant's Pow'r. The King compassionate, amidst his Wants, Was so affected with their sad Complaints, That he assur'd 'em he would stand their Friend, And that they might on speedy Aid depend. Accordingly the King, tho' much involv'd, To keep his Word was punctually resolv'd; And that he might with more successful haste Perform the same, and succour the Distress'd, Twice sixty thousand Pounds, upon some Land 210000 l. per Annum., He borrow'd of the City, out of hand, And thirty thousand more were lent and paid, By the Ingrossers of East-India Trade; Besides what Sums he rais'd by Privy-Seal, Of those that wish'd the French Reformists well. Nor did the Council scruple, by Excise, To levy Money for the King's Supplies, But to that end did a Commission frame, And, under the Great Seal, Pass'd the 3d of February. confirm'd the same; Yet Sov'reign Goodness conscious it might prove A means to alienate his Subjects Love, Its Execution graciously suspends, In hopes to keep his People still his Friends, And rather chose more wisely to prevent Uncommon Measures by a Parliament; Which, by his Writs, he summon'd to appear In March the seventeenth, at Westminster, To whom the King thus spoke his Royal Mind, In words that seem'd more pertinent than kind. My Lords and Gentlemen,— These Times for Action are, and not a shew Of Words, and therefore shall I use but few, And hope, as Kings exemplary should be, In this you'll imitate and follow me: You can't but know the common Wants are great, Must judge, in course, the reason why you meet; And since that these Necessities arise Alone, as Products of your own Advice, I hope the True Religion, and the Laws And Liberties, will prove a moving Cause, With the Defence of our distress'd Allies, Sufficient to perswade ye to Supplies; For if in Duty bound (as sure we are) To use our utmost Diligence and Care, To support, succour, and preserve the Health Of the True Church, and this our Commonwealth, Now is the Exigence of Time that calls For our Assistance, or their Int'rest falls. Therefore, in common Danger, I rely On you, as the best means of a Supply, That if (which God forbid) you should decline Your Duty, I might still proceed in mine, And in my Conscience rest, if your delays Should cause me to propose some other ways (For which I am by God impower'd) to save What some Men, by their Folly, would inslave. Take not these words by way of menacing, I scorn to threaten those beneath a King, But as Advice from him by Nature ty'd, And Duty, for your Safety to provide. Hoping, tho' I have freely spoke thus much, Your peaceful good Demeanors will be such, As to oblige me oftner to appear, And in a thankful manner meet you here. Remembring the Destractions that arose At our last Meeting, you may well suppose I've no great confidence of good Success This present Session, yet I do profess I shall forget the Carriage of the last, And heartily forgive whate'er is past, Hoping you will maintain that good Advice, The Spirit's unity i'th' bond of Peace. This gracious Speech the Senate much approv'd, And seem'd thereby to be extreamly mov'd, The Commons voting thereupon to grant Five Subsidies, to ease the present Want. This welcome News His Majesty soon heard, Who ask'd, by how much odds the Vote was carr'd. The Bearer of the Tidings Secretary Cook. answering, 'Twas carry'd by one Voice. At which the King Changing his Look, and seeming much dismay'd, The Person who had thus surpris'd him said, Your Majesty much rather should rejoice, For the whole House made one united Voice. Which sudden turn the King's discomfort eas'd, And tho' at first cast down, he now was pleas'd, Saying, Go tell the Commons I'll deny Them nothing that respects their Liberty, So far as to the ultimate extent Of any former Grants to Parliament. But still the Commons, e're the Bill was brought Into the House, pursuant to their Vote, Altho' they'd shew'd the King so fair a Face, Relaps'd into the bus'ness of Redress, And, by their Carriage, made it evident, They only Voted what they never meant. So faithless Friends and Flatterers pretend Much verbal Love, but fail us in the End; And when we most rely upon their Aid, Their promis'd Friendships craftily evade. The End of the Third Year. THE Lord Archbishop Abbot's CHARACTER. Morose in Manners, of an Aspect sowre, Those stiff-neck'd Signs of Gravity and Pow'r, Rais'd to the Mitre and the Past'ral Hook, E're chosen Shepherd of one Parish Flock, Or had in any Church-Cathedral been Promoted to the Dignity of Dean, Only at Oxon had before been made, O'th' poorest College there the formal Head; For which dull cloister'd Province, most agree, He was much fitter than for Prelacy; From thence was (by that crafty Northern Peer, King James's first Scotch Favourite, Dunbar) Prefer'd to Royal Favour, and the See Of Litchfield, join'd with ancient Coventry; Translated thence, by th'Int'rest of his Friend, To that of London, where he scarce remain'd So long as to perform one sacred Piece Of his high Office in that Diocess, E're he was snatch'd from thence to be the Prime Of all the Holy Fathers of his Time; Not that we mean the Chief in Parts, but Pow'r, Tho' others might deserve that Province more; Such able Guides, who better knew than he, The Church's Int'rest and Security: For under his unskill'd remisness grew The factious Race, who, in the end, o'erthrew That sacred Pow'r whose Negligence had nurs'd Calvin's proud Brood, of all the Sects the worst: Nor did the Holy Father dream that those Who maul'd the Pope, could be the Church's Foes, Altho' their tender Consciences were such, They thought her Worship wrong, her Pow'r too much, Yet to their Scruples he'd have no regard, But in the Church, Church-Enemies prefer'd; As if by Livings 'twas his good Design, To bribe 'em to her sacred Discipline, A Course the Pow'rful seldom care to steer, Lest mov'd to't by Affection or by Fear: All Men, with him, were Saints that could but rail, With a loud Mouth, against the Priests of Baal, And would in Publick but so civil be, As to forbear the English Hierarchy; Such, tho' their factious Principles were found Unorthodox, destructive, and unsound, Yet would an humble Bend and sneaking Face Procure a hearty Welcome of His Grace, Who would the half-bred halting Guides prefer, Without consid'ring what their Tenets were: From hence those Mischiefs in the Church arose That broke, at length, into domestick Blows. Nor could those Bishops, whose discerning Eyes Beheld the threat'ning Clouds still higher rise, Repel the growing Danger that appear'd Enough tremendous to be justly fear'd; For the Great Pastor, by his wilful Course, Improv'd his gross Mistakes from bad to worse, By giving such fair Countenance to all The Faction, that design'd the Church's Fall, That Laud's Then Bishop of London, and Chancellor of Oxford. reforming of the Oxford Schools, To check the new destructive Principles, And other Means, had but a fruitless End, For Calvin still had Abbot for his Friend, Who left the Church, Christ's Garden, when he dy'd, So over-run with Weeds, on e'ery side, That his learn'd Successor, with all his Care, Could not the Sacred Wilderness repair, Tho' the great Task he painfully pursu'd, And crown'd his pious Labours with his Blood. So toils the careful Swain to clear his Ground, When Cockle does among the Wheat abound. Nor did the careless Primate, for his great Neglect, escape the Censure of the State, But was suspended, for a time, from all The Exercise of Pow'r Episcopal, And other Prelates, better skill'd than he, Appointed to sustain the Hierarchy: But Faction murm'ring that His mod'rate Grace, Who serv'd their Ends, should lose his Place, The King, to please his Enemies, restor'd To his high Station, the suspended Lord; Who, with profound Remisness still supply'd That high and holy Office till he dy'd. Thus all Men favour what themselves approve, And careless grow of what they cannot love. Nor will our Guides renounce, tho' ne'er so wise, Those Errors that from Principle arise. THE Earl of Portland's CHARACTER. By Blood, not Noble, nor of Low Degree, Born to prolong an ancient Family, Bred in the Middle-Temple, yet took care To be no noisy Wrangler at the Bar, But rather chose in silence to obtain The useful Knowledge both of Books and Men, Quitting his Native Country at the Years When Men grow Wise by being Travellers; And not like callow Boys, who visit Rome Or France, to bring their Foppish Vices home: When he return'd, improv'd as he design'd, With all that Constitutes an able Mind, Thus qualify'd to make the Better sort His Friends, he then betook himself to Court, Where he, for Years, resided at so great And wise a distance from Affairs of State, Forcing his cautious Carriage to agree With the strict Rules of awful Modesty; As if by Nature to reserv'dness prone, He meant to live long seen e're he was known; And that the Course he steer'd should shew him wise, Some time before he would attempt to rise. So Birds that mean to soar the greatest height, Well prune their Wings before they take their flight. Long thus he waited, at a large Expence, Till he'd consum'd a fair Inheritance, And, for Support, till he could gain his Ends, Was forc'd, as Sureties, to involve his Friends, Who knowing well his Merits and his Case, Resolv'd to run the Risque of his Success, Tho', at that Juncture, he could boast no more Than the fair Countenance of Men in Pow'r, A flatt'ring Sunshine that so oft withdraws Its courtly Beams and ne'er assigns a Cause. However, he e'relong fulfill'd his Hopes, And found he'd rested on substantial Props, Was sent abroad Embassador, to treat About restoring the Palatinate. At his Return, to recompence his Care, And well-approv'd Dispatch of that Affair, Was made Exchequer-Chancellor, and chose O'th' Privy-Council; and, at length, arose To the high Seat of Treasurer, a Post Where Fav'rites prosper at the Nation's Cost: But Weston, tho' no Statesman could have more Ambition to enlarge his Wealth and Pow'r, That he might make his Family as Great As others who had held that Staff of State, Yet was he so expensive and profuse, In all things, more especially his House, That the whole Profits of his gainful Place, And all that he, by other means, could raise, Were not sufficient to supply his Wants, Occasion'd by his loose Extravagance; So that the gracious King was twice so kind To pay his Debts, to ease his troubl'd Mind, Which indispos'd and lessen'd his regard To Publick Bus'ness, as himself declar'd. Yet, after all, the Favours and Support Of his good Prince, and mighty Rise at Court, He grew imperious, slighting to the Queen, And chang'd his very Temper and his Meen To all, not caring who he made his Foe, And when he'd done, would cringe and truckle low, Which caus'd the World to slight him, and deride His cow'rdly Fear, as greater than his Pride. Thus he proceeded, vainly thinking all The King had done, a recompence too small For his conceited Merits, till he spent Eight Years in Pomp, alloy'd with Discontent, And then from Court he to the Grave withdrew, Condemn'd by most, lamented but by few, Leaving a num'rous Family behind, So ill supported that they soon declin'd. Why should the High be Proud, the Low Despair, Since sudden Changes make us what we are. Some climb aloft, tho' once scarce worth a Groat, Whilst others fall, thro' Negligence, to nought. THE Earl of Manchester's CHARACTER. Of Noble Extract, but a younger Son, Bred to the knotty Laws, thro' which he run, From Post to Post, till made the Chief of all The honour'd Gownmen in the wrangling Hall, Where, in the Reign of James, some Years he sate, High on the Bench, and much employ'd in State. From thence remov'd into a fickler Air, By Buckingham, and made Lord-Treasurer; Which pompous, wealthy, but uncertain Post Within less compass than a Year he lost: Having, at Court, no other gainful Place To trust to, that might lessen the Disgrace, And ease the Cares of his ambitious Soul, But Council-President, more Cry than Wool, Adding the Honour, as he rowl'd down Hill, Of Viscount, to the Name of Mandevile, Which crown'd his Cadency with empty Fame, But brought him nothing to support the same. So Men serve Wantons, when their Love grows slack, At parting Kiss, but keep their Substance back. However, seeming easy and content, Free to forgive, and backward to resent, His Temper soon did with the King prevail, As well as Duke, to make him Privy-Seal, An easy Station, which he never lost, But for the Term of Life enjoy'd the Post; Was also rais'd one Step of Honour high'r, And, by the Crown, made Earl of Manchester. Thus Patience and good Temper oft regains, What he for ever loses that complains. In Bus'ness none more diligent could prove, Or in Affairs with greater Wisdom move, Preserving in his Age a vig'rous Mind, No ways impair'd, but actively inclin'd, That, near his Death, his Parts were thought as strong, If not more quick, than they appear'd when young, His Honours, by the Favour of the Throne, Had always faster than his Fortune grown, Which made him too solicitous to raise The latter, by some inconvenient ways, Which offer'd to his Int'rest, but were such That brought his Conduct under some reproach, Lessen'd his Counsels and Authority, In publick Service, to a low degree, Tho' his mature Abilities were known Fit to assist a Kingdom or a Throne; So that his Vertues still preserv'd his Ease, And more than ballanc'd his Infirmities. None for the Church had greater Zeal than he, Or more unquestionable Loyalty, Which gain'd him Credit, with the Publick weigh'd, And gave some Sanction to the Slips he'd made, That with the Nation he maintain'd a fair Repute, and left a decent Character, Quitting the Stage in those impetuous Times The beginning of the Rebellion., When the best Vertues were the highest Crimes, When all Religion for a Cypher stood, When Law nor Gospel could secure the Good, Nor Justice punish those that bath'd in Blood. A.D. 1628. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Fourth Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1628. The Warrants, by whose force and vertue those Imprison'd were, who did the Loan oppose, Shewing no legal Cause of their Restraint, Were now thought grievous by the Parliament, And by the Faction bandy'd up and down, To aggravate the House against the Crown, For fear the Senate should incline to heal The Breaches 'twixt the King and Commonweal. The Soldiers also, who had serv'd by Sea, Wanting their Pay when they return'd from Rhee, Were therefore, to supply their present need, In private Houses chiefly Billetted. This was alledg'd to be against the Laws, And of loud Clamours prov'd a further Cause, Much heighten'd by their b'ing a mingl'd Brood Of Scotch and Irish, insolently rude; Yet, when the King Commissions gave to awe And try the Soldiery by Martial Law, The captious Senate disallow'd that Pow'r, Which ne'er had been deny'd the Crown before. These and the Levies that the King had us'd, By which they thought the Nation much abus'd, Caus'd 'em to frame a Law The Petition of Right. that might prevent Like Practises in Kingly Government, Which, in full Parliament, the King was pleas'd To pass, in hopes their Spirits would be eas'd. And now, by all Men, there was thought to be So prosp'rous and so sweet a Harmony, 'Twixt King and Parliament, that nothing more Could obviate what they'd voted Weeks before. But all this Sunshine that appear'd so bright, Was soon by Clouds eclips'd and turn'd to Night; For the proud Faction reigning in the House, On these Concessions grew the more morose, And further press'd and gap'd as if they meant, By piecemeal, to devour the Government, Framing a new Remonstrance, to affront The Throne, and stop Supplies as they were wont, Complaining that the Duke's excessive Pow'r, Render'd both King and Kingdom insecure, Charging a Crowd of Evils in the State, Upon his being so profusely Great, Humbly submitting, as they pleas'd to say, Tho' in a haughty and imperious way, To Royal Wisdom, whether such Command, As His Grace exercised by Sea and Land, Ought to be trusted in one Subject's Hand. This bold Remonstrance did the Senate frame, Presenting to the patient King June 17. in the Banqueting-House. the same, Who answer'd, he was much surpris'd to find Such Usage, that appear'd the more unkind, Since he had pass'd what they desir'd of late, Without the least Objection or Debate. Adding, that those Complaints they had prefer'd, Should be consider'd as they best deserv'd. Thus Faction, Miser-like, the more they gain, The more they covet, and the more complain. Charles, from his first accession to the Throne, As many Kings had unmolested done, Had also levy'd, to the Senate's Grief, Tunnage and Poundage for the Crown's relief; The House alledg'd he ought not to exact The same, unless 'twas settl'd by an Act, Especially since giving his assent To th'late Petition The Petition of Right. of the Parliament. The thankless Commons therefore fram'd a new Remonstrance on this Head, to further shew, That their Designs were only to restrain The Sov'reign Pow'r, and not to give, but gain. So that the King, unwilling they should tease His Royal Breast with more Remonstrances, Resum'd his Courage, hoping to prevent Their second, and Prorogu'd the Parliament From the 20th of June to the 20th of October., Making a Speech i'th' Upper-House, to show The Lords the Carriage of the House below, Alledging their Behaviour to the Throne, Was the sole Cause why he dismiss'd 'em soon, Touching with Patience upon all their past Affronts and Insults that had giv'n distaste, Declaring, that he never meant to grant Tunnage and Poundage, which he could not want, Charging the Lords and Judges to regard, As his true meaning, what he then declar'd. During this Session, tho' they prov'd so warm Against the Duke, he valu'd not the Storm, But slighting their Remonstrance to the Throne, With usual Courage chearfully went on, Providing Succours to supply the need Of Rochel with incessant Care and Speed: But being ready to Embark and Sail From Portsmouth, with the next inviting Gale, Was by a Villain's John Felton, a discontented Officer in the last Years Expedition. Hand depriv'd of Breath, And, at one Blow, surpris'd with sudden Death. The Murderer ne'er flying from the Door, But walk'd compos'dly when the Deed was o'er, Without his Hat, which he had drop'd by chance, In the infernal dreadful Exigence; So that soon charg'd with the inhumane Fact, He frankly own'd, and glory'd in the Act; And being ask'd what Motives could incense His Soul to such a barbarous Offence, Reply'd, the inside of his Hat would show Sufficient Reasons for the timely Blow, Where looking, found he'd pasted in the Crown Some Words o'th' late Remonstrance to the Throne, In which the Parliament had been so free To style the Duke the Kingdom's Enemy: Adding, that he expected to be slain In his attempt upon so great a Man, And therefore took that Method to impart The Reasons why he struck at Viller's Heart. Since Faction oft have found such daring Friends, As Felton, to promote their wicked Ends, How dang'rous is it in a Christian State, For jarring Parties to reproach the Great. The Pious Monarch was at Publick Pray'r When this sad News was whisper'd in his Ear, But at his sacred Duty was inspir'd With so much Zeal, that he the Tidings heard, Without discov'ring in his Looks or Meen, One outward Sign of any Shock within, But at his bless'd Devotion was so full Of Heav'n, that nothing could surprise his Soul. So should the pious Christian learn to bear The loss of Friends, and all things that are dear, And never to repine, exclaim, or carp At adverse Fortune, tho' it's ne'er so sharp. Nor is it worth our Labour to be Great, Since true content may bless an humbler State. Besides, the Hero that does highest stand, And o'er whole Armies proudly bears Command, We see may fall by one ill-natur'd Hand. This fatal Chance, tho' mischievously great, Delay'd not the Proceedings of the Fleet, Which now for Rochel readily set Sail, The Earl of Lindsey being Admiral, But found the Haven so securely barr'd, That to relieve them prov'd a Task too hard, Tho' they attempted several times, in vain, To force their way, but could not break the Chain. So that when Rochel's only Hopes were fail'd, And she foresaw that she was doom'd to yield, Her Chiefs went forth, submitted to their King, And tender'd, as an humble Offering, The starving Town, and so receiv'd their Prince With open Gates, and due Magnificence. Thus, when you're worsted, make a Foe your Friend, By freely giving what you can't defend. The Senate's time of Meeting drawing on, The King, for Reasons to his Wisdom known, Prorogu'd 'em longer, From the 20th of October, to the 20th of January. hoping (as we guess) More leisure might abate their wild excess, Thought it convenient also to restore Archbishop Abbot to his former Pow'r, As the best Means to moderate the Heats Rais'd by some pert Ecclesiastick Wits, Who, by their Pens, had sow'd Religious Jars, And fill'd the Church with Press and Pulpit Wars, Both sides abetted by the Rev'rend Lawn, Who, like old Gamsters push'd the younger on. The King, to stop these Quarrels in the Schools, Publish'd the Thirty Nine Church Articles, Also a Declaration to restrain The Wild-fire scatter'd by contentious Men, Who, proud of their own Merits, hop'd to rise By wav'ring Popularity and Noise: Potter, a Calvinist, obtain'd his End, And to the Holy Mitre Was made Bishop of Carlisle. did ascend. But all these Measures, us'd with an intent To win that Party to the Government, Lost their effect, and rather made 'em proud, Than taught 'em Duty, Peace, or Gratitude. Thus Royal Favours, Princes ought to know, Make Faction but the more imperious grow; No Lenitives their Poyson will expel, The more you sooth 'em, still the more they swell. No sooner had the Senate met, and fix'd Their Grand Committees, for their purpose mix'd, That those Incendiaries that stood between The King and People might preside therein, But the wise Heads, appointed to inspect Religion, left it suffer'd some Neglect, Began, like trusty true Geneva Saints, T'allarm the Nation with their loud Complaints, Importing, that the Church must surely be In danger from the growth of Popery, And that 'twas weaken'd and o'er-run with Schism, By means of that and of Arminianism, Assigning sev'ral Instances to make The gaping People swallow the Mistake; For the sole danger of the Church arose, Not from her Popish, but Calvinian Foes. So jugling Knaves, that they may better play Their Tricks, direct your Eyes another way. Whilst this Committee for the Holy State, Did, by their false Alarms, new Fears create, The active House the like enquiry made Into Affairs of Government and Trade, That they might animate themselves and tease The Throne about some new Miscarriages; And that in this good Temper they were in They might have something to subsist their Spleen, Sev'ral Petitions, op'ning an abuse To Merchants, were presented to the House, Complaining that the Customers had made Unlawful Seizures, to the hurt of Trade, That divers Informations had been brought In the Star-Chamber., And Prosecutions made, without Defau't, Against Importers, who had stop'd their Hands, From paying the exorbitant Demands Of Tonnage and of Poundage, which the Throne Relinquish'd by the late Petition Of Right. And one of those who had been handl'd thus Rolls a Merchant. B'ing then a factious Member of the House, His Suff'rings set the Commons Teeth on edge, To judge his Case a breach of Privilege; For which Offence each Custom-House Survey'r, Who seiz'd his Goods, were summon'd to appear. Herein the King thought fit to interpose, In hopes to curb the Fury of his Foes, Urging, the Customers were all constrain'd, As Men addicted to his own Command, But that he did not by Commission give Them Power to demand and to receive Those Duties as his own peculiar Right, But thro' a firm presumption that they might, Pursuant to their large Professions grant The same, e'releng, by Bill of Parliament, Which he desir'd they would dispatch with speed, That all Disputes thereon might be agreed. This gave no satisfaction to the House, But rather made the Senate more morose, Who zealously resolv'd to now prepare A new Remonstrance upon this Affair, And fearing they should be dissolv'd before They could compleat the same, they lock'd their door, Trusting one Member Sir Miles Hubbard. with the Key, that none Should enter till the spightful Work was done; Nor would the busy House admittance grant To the Black-Rod, when with a Message sent: Which Usage so incens'd the Royal Breast, That he commanded, with unusual haste, The Captains of his Guards and Pensioners, To fly that Instant, and to force the Doors. In the mean time the Commons had prepar'd The Heads of their Remonstrance, and prefer'd The same to th'Speaker Sir John Finch., who refus'd to close Therewith, or put the Question to the House: On which, two Members Mr. Denzil Hollis and Sir Peter Heyman., fearing the Affair In hand should cool, confin'd him to the Chair, Till one, who of the factious Task was proud, The foll'wing Protestation read aloud. So forward Boys at Christmas play the Fool, And tease their Master e're they break up School. 1 Whoever shall bring any Innovation Into the Church, establish'd in this Nation, Countenance Pop'ry or Arminianism, Broach or encourage any other Schism, Shall to the Commonwealth reputed be, A Capital and Publick Enemy. 2 Whoever dares to Counsel or Advise Taking or Levying of the Subsidies Of Tonnage or of Poundage, till consent Be first confirm'd by Act of Parliament, Shall also for the same be deem'd hereby, A Capital and Common Enemy. 3 If any Person willingly complies, Or yields to pay the 'foresaid Subsidies, Not being granted to the Sov'reign Pow'r, By the consent of Parliament before, Shall, for the same Offence, be deem'd no less Than a Betray'r of England's Liberties. No sooner had the Commons run this length, But they adjourn'd the House till March the tenth, And, having eas'd their Spleen, arose before The Pensioners and Guards approach'd the Door. The King, uneasy and provok'd to find The Commons so rebelliously inclin'd, Sent forth his Proclamation to prevent Their meeting, and dissolv'd the Parliament; Altho' he did not formally compleat The same until the Day they were to sit, When the good King vouchsafing to put on His Senatory Robes and awful Crown, Came to the House of Lords, compos'd his Look Assum'd his Throne, and thus the Monarch spoke: My Lords, 'Tis but unpleasant to appear On that Occasion which hath brought me here, Kings rather chusing to impose the weight Of harsh Commands on Ministers of State, Reserving to themselves such Tasks alone, As they're assur'd are pleasing from a Throne; But since to Vertue, Praise is justly due, And Blame to those who vicious Ends pursue, I'm therefore now come hither to declare To you, and all the World, the Commons were, By their Seditious Carriage, ev'ly meant, The Cause why I dissolve this Parliament, And must confess, I cannot charge the same On you, my Lords, or your Demeanors blame, But do acknowledge your deportment such, As to have added to my Comfort much; And that your Duty ballanc'd the distaste The Commons warm Proceedings gave my Breast: Not that I charge the whole, for many there Secur'd themselves from the contagious Air, And would not be infected by the Lungs Of those that spread their Venom with their Tongues, Vipers, who, to conclude, must not go free From the Rewards of their Delinquency. But you, my Lords, most justly may expect My Favour, and be sure I shall protect (As a good King should do) from Perils free, My loving, dutiful Nobility. The King, some Days before he made his Speech, Had issu'd out his Warrants to attach The leading Members, who had been the cause Of all those fatal Mischiefs that arose. Four of the number (being nine Sir John Elliot, Sir Peter Heyman, Sir Miles Hubbart, Denzil Hollis, John Selden, William Coriton, Benjamin Valentine, William Stroud, Walter Long, Esquires. in all) Were carr'd before the Council at Whitehall. But there refusing, by a joint consent, To make due answer out of Parliament, For their stiff Carriage and contempt of Pow'r, Were, by the Board, committed to the Tow'r. The rest were taken, in a little time, And each compell'd to answer for his Crime. But lest these restless Spirits, to excuse Their Madness, thro' their Counties should diffuse Malicious Libels, by some Hands unknown, To draw the Subjects Duty from the Throne, A Declaration by the King was made, And to all Magistrates forthwith convey'd, Shewing the Motives of that Discontent, Which caus'd him to dissolve the Parliament, Giving a brief account of all they'd done And said, since their first Session was begun. Thus factious Spirits, doom'd to be the curse Of Nations, vex and tease their Governours, Till, like those Gyants who the Gods defy'd, They perish in their own rebellious Pride. The End of the Fourth Year. THE Earl of Arundel's CHARACTER. His Dress and Carriage diff'ring from the Mode, Gave the World reason to suspect him Proud: His Aspect and his Actions shew'd him Great; For whatsoe'er he did was done in State: And when he walk'd, to grace his Mother Earth, His Steps display'd his Quality and Birth, Whilst the quaint Habit that his Lordship wore, Copy'd from Picture or from Theatre, In Slits and Scollups, let the Nation see The Robes of Primitive Nobility; As if he courted from the young and gay, The Rev'rence we to Tombs and Statues pay. Within himself and to himself he liv'd, Few Visits made, and very few receiv'd, Except from Strangers, Men of Foreign Air, Or such as strangely dress'd as if they were. Thus those who are fantastick love to see Others take Pattern by their Vanity. Sometimes his Lordship would to Court repair, Because a greater than himself was there; Yet went but seldom, caring not to see A Person that could boast more Pow'r than he. So that he oft was brought into Disgrace, By his proud, headstrong, and imperious Ways; For rather than apply, or condescend To make a Fav'rite Minister his Friend, With careless Patience he'd submit to be Severely treated by Authority. Therefore, by shewing such neglect of Pow'r, Was, once or twice, committed to the Tow'r. Such Ruffles caus'd him oft to cross the Seas, To Foreign Shores, for Safety and for Ease; Chiefly to Italy, where he had spent Much Time, with seeming Pleasure and Content, Loving to imitate their solemn Pride, And stiff-neck'd Gravity in all he did, Preferring that warm Country far before The plenteous Blessings of his Native Shore, Retiring thither when the Factious Storm, At home, did these unhappy Isles alarm, Remaining in that calm delightful Air, Till Death remov'd him thence the Lord knows where; None knowing in what Faith he liv'd or dy'd, Unless his chief Religion was his Pride. Thus honour'd that fam'd Climate with his Death, Which he had chosen to prolong his Breath. So most Men hug the Vice they most approve, And perish in pursuit of what they love. THE Earl of Pembroke's CHARACTER. Scarce any Subject-Peer, before or since, Was e'er so lov'd of People and of Prince; Nor could the greatest in the Rolls of Fame, More justly plead a Title to the same, For both his Parts and Probity were such, That no Man could have more, unless too much: Nor did he seek those profitable Spheres, Or wealthy Stations sought by other Peers, But rather chose on barren Hills to stand, Where he had little Gain, but great Command; Which made him live less envy'd by the Court, And more esteem'd by all the Nobler Sort, Supporting his great Grandeur by his own Estate, and not the Bounty of the Throne. This rais'd his Reputation, spread his Fame, And gain'd him, thro' the Land, a Noble Name, Superior to the King's more craving Friends, Who fawn'd at Court for more ignoble Ends. Yet, as bright Cynthia in her Face has Spots, So were his Vertues stain'd with vicious Blots, For 'twas his Fault to triumph in excess Of Pleasures, as his only Happiness; And to indulge all other loose Desires, As well as fan and feed his am'rous Fires. But he, alas, had paid too dear a Rate For his Wife's Fortune, tho' 'twas vastly great, Her Person wanting those engaging Charms That he pursu'd and found in others Arms, Tho' his Amours were of that gen'rous kind, As to esteem the Graces of the Mind Much more than Beauty, doating upon Sence Above all other Female Excellence, B'ing rather pleasur'd by the tempting Wiles Of Woman's Tongue, than her familiar Smiles. Thus did he live, and, at a great Expence, Oblig'd and humour'd each Concupiscence, Dying upon that Day which did compleat His fifti'th Year, just after he had eat A chearful hearty Supper, which Repast, Altho' he seem'd in Health, yet prov'd his last, Sandford, his Tutor, having long before Foretold the fatal Day, if not the Hour. Therefore since Wealth and Wisdom are no guard Against our Doom, we ought to live prepar'd; For Death, at once, can pull the greatest down, And change his Mirth into a dying Groan. The Character of the Lower-House in the Third Parliament, Call'd in the Third, and Dissolv'd in the Fourth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First. The major part were factiously inclin'd, And fit to back what plotting Heads design'd; Their Leaders crafty, contumelious, proud, Active and bold, but neither wise nor good, Who rather chose by Violence to extort Those Condescensions of the yielding Court, Which, by fair means, they might with ease have gain'd, Had they their rude provoking Warmth restrain'd; For Royal Goodness would have granted much, Had they apply'd without unjust Reproach: But they postpon'd their Duty to their Pride, And ask'd as if they hop'd to be deny'd, That they might still alledge new cause to vent Their spight against Monarchick Government, And have the better Grounds to charge the Throne With fictious Failings to obscure their own. So the base Wife, grown petulent or lewd, Defames her Husband in the Neighbourhood, That she may pity'd tread the Paths of Shame, Whilst he she injures most incurrs the Blame. Nor could the King's Compliances asswage Their restless Malice and impetuous Rage, For still the more he granted, still the more They crav'd, in order to reduce his Pow'r, Shewing by all the Methods they pursu'd, They scorn'd that sneaking Vertue Gratitude, And when well us'd grew more absurd, to prove That Faction spurns at Clemency and Love; As if they thought 'twas sinful to be won By the kind Favours of a Giving Throne; And that their headstrong Principles despis'd All Kingly Powers, unless they tyranniz'd, Scoffing at e'ery mild and gentle Course, The patient Sov'reign us'd instead of Force, Plainly resolving not to yield or pay Obedience, whilst they'd Pow'r to Disobey: Not that the whole were of so wild a Strain, Some were good Men, who struggl'd hard in vain, Nor could they to the King's Advantage turn One Point, the Tares had so o'er-run the Corn, Which caus'd the injur'd Monarch to disperse The Senate, who, each Day, grew worse and worse. And if the King, who was too just and wise, Would have comply'd with some severe Advice, He'd then, for evermore, as France had done, With them, dissolv'd their Constitution, And, in his Anger, breath'd one Royal Blast, That should have made that Parliament the Last, But Sov'reign Wisdom, for his People's Good, The fatal Counsel, tho' provok'd, withstood. But let aspiring Faction have a care, At all times, how they move the Throne too far, Lest for ill use of what they've long enjoy'd, That boasted Blessing is at once destroy'd. A.D. 1629. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Fifth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1629. Now, Informations in the Star Court of Star-Chambe, May the 7th. were brought Against those Members who'd been most in fau't, But in that Court were drop'd, new Charges laid In the King's-Bench, and fresh Proceedings made; The Pris'ners mov'd, by Council, to be bail'd The Court comply'd, provided they would yield To likewise give in Sureties for their good Behaviour, which the proud Cabal withstood, Tho' the Court offer'd that their Bail should be Recogniz'd also as Security. But they refus'd, alledging their assent Would prove a great Offence to Parliament, Adding, that what their Lordships had desir'd, Was but Discretion, not by Law requir'd: The Judges gave their Arguments, but still The Pris'ners all maintain'd their stubborn Will, And were, for persevering in the same, Remanded to the Prison whence they came, And so well handl'd for their rude Offence, Back'd only with Demurrs and Insolence, That, for neglect of Pleading, they, at last, Were all upon a nihil dicit Cast, Sentenc'd to pay great Fines unto the Crown, And to remain in Prison till the Throne Should, thro' its gracious Clemency, enlarge Their narrow Bounds, by granting a discharge. Thus do the Factious meet, in e'ery Age, The just Rewards of their unbridl'd Rage: Yet every Reign produces, more or less, Fresh Monsters that disturb the Publick Peace, Who vainly glory in the like pursuits, Altho' their Works produce such bitter Fruits. The Gallick Monarch bending all his Care Upon Casal, and the Italian War, Was now desirously inclin'd to close In Bonds of Friendship with his English Foes; Nor had the British Court less cause than he, To wish the neighb'ring Kings in Amity; Accordingly the wise Venitian State, In this good Work, took care to mediate, And prov'd in the Affair so true a Friend, That they to both procur'd a pleasing End, Upon such Terms that neither King refus'd To Sign, or thought himself too hardly us'd: So that both Princes having thus comply'd, The Peace was in September ratify'd. Tho' some delight to toil in War and Strife, Yet Friendship crowns the Sweets of humane Life. Soon after this the haughty Spaniard sent Don Carlos to the English Government, With such fair Overtures of Peace, that won The like Compliance in the British Throne; That tho' the King had highly been displeas'd, With factious Insult, and provok'd and ceas'd, Yet one kind prosp'rous Year made good amends, And turn'd two potent Enemies to Friends. Thus Providence allots to e'ery State, Some heav'nly Smiles, to sooth the frowns of Fate. This bless'd vicissitude of War to Peace, Brought into England such a vast encrease Of Foreign Commerce, both from France and Spain, That Britain ne'er could boast a happier Reign. The Spaniard sent in Bullion, every Year, Six hundred thousand Crowns to've Coinage here, For the supply of Military Bands, By him supported in the Netherlands; The Money being most return'd in Lead, Tin, Leather, Cloth, and other Goods of Trade, All English Products, that the great advance Of Traffick chang'd each Merchant's Countenance, Turn'd the late Frowns of Faction into Smiles, And made them Glory in their prosp'rous Toils, As if they'd nothing to disturb their Brains, But to embark their Goods and count their Gains. Nor did these Blessings, wasted by the Seas, From Foreign Nations, fail of an Encrease, Till the fair Thames was, to her Fame, become The only crowded Mart of Christendom, Where anchor'd Fleets their lofty Topmasts rear'd, And like a Winter's Grove of Pines appear'd, Whilst Laden Barks the yielding Waters plow'd, And steer'd with Caution thro' the floating Crowd, Thus Providence, to win the factious Brood To due Obedience, Love, and Gratitude, Gave all these Blessings by the Royal Hand, Yet could not long oblige a thankless Land, Whose murm'ring Sons embrac'd the wealthy Boon, But, Beggar-like, forgot the Donor soon. The End of the Fifth Year. THE Earl of Montgomery's CHARACTER. Comely his Person, and, when youthful, skill'd In all the manly Pastimes of the Field, Horses and Hounds he truly understood, And by their Marks and Looks could chuse the good. Nor could the Fox outwind him in a Chase, Or keenest Sportsman hunt with greater Grace. This early Knowledge in Diana's Games And Sports, first won the Favour of King James, Who made him, in the Second of his Reign, An Earl, and of his Chamber Gentleman, That he was thought, by all the Nobler Sort, To be the only Fav'rite of the Court, Till Carr, that Northern Comet, did arise, Whose Lustre better pleas'd the Royal Eyes; Which when the Earl perceiv'd, he was so far From striving to eclipse the rising Star, That he withdrew, and did himself postpone, To clear his Rival's Passage to the Throne, A Temper seldom found in Men of State, Whose Curse it is to Envy and to Hate The Man whose Merits are esteem'd more great. But 'twas believ'd the Pomp of Princes Courts Was less engaging than his Rural Sports, And that the Earl less Satisfaction found In Royal Smiles, than in his Horse and Hound. Thus what dull Appetites the Gods intail, We see, in spight of Honour, will prevail. However, this Compliance gratify'd The Monarch rather than contending Pride, And caus'd him still to favour and approve The Earl, as Second in his Royal Love, Which Blessing he with little Fruit enjoy'd, Till Heaven call'd the peaceful Prince aside, Who recommended, e're he left his Throne, Th'obsequious Earl to his attentive Son, As a Just Man, from Court-deception free, Confirm'd in Duty and Fidelity. This caus'd the kind Successor to advance The Earl, and favour'm with his Countenance. But yet, as most Men, when their Friends decline, Their Honour cloud, when it should brightest shine. So when the Faction with the King grew warm, He wanted Ballast to endure the Storm, And left his sinking Admiral to steer Himself into the safest Harbour near. Thus many unsuspected smoothly Sail, And seem Couragious with a prosp'rous Gale, Who, when the Winds prove boistrous and untow'rd, To save the Bark, toss Honour overboard. THE Earl of Dorset's CHARACTER. Of comely Stature and majestick Meen, Beauteous without, and furnish'd well within, A pow'rful Master of commanding Sence, Adorn'd with all the Charms of Eloquence, Vig'rous and airy, of a sparkling Wit, Learn'd, active, bold, for any Bus'ness fit; Grandson to Buckhurst, Treas'rer when King James Had left the Tweed for Britain's wealthy Thames, Beneath whose Care, the Father being dead, The hopeful Youth to manly Years was bred, And in due Season, when his Grandsire dy'd, Was with a Fortune suitably supply'd; And, to compleat the Comforts of his Life, A Golden Heiress was assign'd his Wife. But notwithstanding that his Parts were great, It was the gallant Knight's Then Sir Edward Sackville. unhappy Fate, To give full Scope, without the least restraint To all his loose Desires, unjustly bent, Making ignoble Pleasures his pursuit, That stain'd his Worth and lessen'd his Repute These sinful Courses did at length produce A Quarrel 'twixt Sir Edward and Lord Bruce, Who, with their Surgeons, cross'd the Seas Into Flanders. to end The warm Dispute about a Female Friend: The Duel, tho' unjust, was boldly fought, Till the Scotch Noble perish'd on the Spot, The Knight retiring, that his Wounds might be Reliev'd, into a neigb'ring Monastry, Where he remain'd, beneath his Surgeon's Care, Till he return'd unrival'd to his Fair, With whom he still continu'd to delight And satiate his unruly Appetite, Tho' he seem'd always greatly to lament The fatal Quarrel, and its ill Event, But could not quit her Beauty who had been The pleasing Cause of such a crying Sin. Thus most, by halves, do Satan's Power defeat, Repent the bitter, but retain the sweet. The Earl of Dorset, Brother to the Knight, Living at large to an expensive height, In a few Years had squander'd the Estate, Left by his Grandsire Buckhurst, tho' 'twas great; And at length dying without Issue-Male The Title to his younger Brother fell, Which brought too little with it to support The publick Grandeur of a Peer at Court, Where most endeavour vainly to outdo Each other in external Pomp and Shew. However Sackville, who had shin'd so bright Among the House of Commons, when a Knight, Now Earl of Dorset, in his riper Years, Was, for his Wisdom, honour'd by his Peers: And had he not been much dispirited, And wrung by a near Fortune, would have made As fit a Person to have serv'd his Prince And Country, as hath liv'd before or since; For none could boast a more discerning Soul, Of Knowledge, Temper, Wit, and Honour full, Tho' Bold, yet not contentiously inclin'd, But Manly, Gen'rous, Affable and Kind; Tho' unpromoted, was from Faction free, No Peer more faithful to the Crown than he. Therefore since narrow Fortune could prevent Such Parts from rising high in Government, Well may a wretched Indigence obscure And bear down Merit undeserv'dly Poor. THE Earl of Carlisle's CHARACTER. A younger Brother, born beyond the Tweed, Of Noble Parents, and as nobly Bred, Who enter'd England with King James's Train, No other than a private Gentleman; But rightly qualify'd in e'ery sort Of Learning, proper for a Prince's Court; And, tho' but young, a Master of those Arts That gave a taking Lustre to his Parts, Which being well supported by the Grace Of a good Presence and alluring Face, Soon gain'd his Point, and caus'd the Youth to be Distinguish'd by discerning Majesty. So that his smooth deportment early won The friendly Favour of the gracious Throne: Was also by the English most approv'd, And best of all his Countrymen belov'd, Sincerely chusing rather to depend Upon a Southern than a Northern Friend. Shewing at all times he delighted much In English Conversation more than Scotch; And in Affairs relating to the Crown, Would serve their Int'rest sooner than his own. By such like Generosities he gain'd The general Esteem of all the Land; Was, by his gracious Prince, unenvy'd, made A Gentleman belonging to his Bed, Created Viscount Doncaster beside, And then preferr'd unto a wealthy Bride Sole Daughter and Heiress to the Lord Denny.: The King himself, to influence the Dame, Pleas'd with the Match, vouchsaf'd to move the same, Which she comply'd with, bringing an Estate, In Summs as well as Acres vastly great. She dying, left a Son, who long possest Her Lands the Father had no Pow'r to waste, Who now ascending to a greater height, Was made an Earl, and of the Garter Knight, Groom of the Stole, and then, to bless his Arms, Marry'd a beauteous Maid, all over Charms, The Daughter of Northumberland Earl of the Great, But did not for his Approbation wait, Who therefore gave no Dowry to his Son, But bare forgiveness of the Inj'ry done; So far that he receiv'd the Nuptial Pair With some Respect, but took no further Care; Nor was the gen'rous Earl so narrow Soul'd, As to regard the common Idol, Gold, Except to spend it all the ways he cou'd, To gratify the Pride of Flesh and Blood, For no Athenian Timon ever liv'd So vain, or more expensive Ways contriv'd, That he'd the Honour to be thought of all Profuse gay Courtiers, the Original; For other Peers, who glory'd in Expence, Seem'd but to Copy his Extravagance, Projecting such uncommon costly Whims, As if he daily study'd new Extreams. Yet had he Parts so eminently great, That he was fit to steer the Helm of State, But thought the busy Toils of Government Less pleasant, and, perhaps, less Innocent, Did therefore the fatigue of Bus'ness slight, To run thro' all the Mazes of Delight; And after he'd consum'd the wealthy Store, Of twice two hundred thousand Pounds and more; He dy'd, as those Scotch Clouds began to rise, Which cover'd both the Kingdoms in a trice, And with as much tranquility of Mind, The World, and all its Vanities, resign'd, As if he'd trod the Footsteps of a Saint, And, at his Death, had little to repent, Leaving the undoubted Fame of a refin'd And most accomplish'd Gentleman behind; But neither House or Land unspent, to save His Memory from with'ring o'er his Grave. Thus he, who was esteem'd so wise and great, Finish'd, at once, his Life and his Estate, As if he meant to let his Equals see, That Pleasure is the road to Poverty. A.D. 1630. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Sixth Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1630. To crown the happy Peace with France and Spain, On May the twenty ninth, the pregnant Queen Was, to the Joy of all that lov'd the Throne, Safely deliver'd of a Royal Son, Who after, as his Martyr'd Father's Heir, Assum'd the Sceptre he was born to bear. In June The 27th. the Court, in Splendor, nam'd the Boy, Whilst e'ery Steeple rung aloud for Joy: The Prince Elector, and the Royal Pair Of France, the Witnesses, by Proxy, were. No sooner was this Ceremony o'er, But the King hearing, from the German Shore, That 'twas agreed, and that there would be soon A solemn Diet kept at Ratisbon, Concluded that the only time to treat About restoring the Palatinate, Was when th'Estates were met to rectify All such Affairs as they should find awry. Pursuant, an Ambassador Sir Robert Anstruther. was sent From hence, to the Imperial Government, With a kind soothing Message to entreat The Emp'ror to forgive and to forget His Brother, the Elector's, great Offence, Which was, indeed, sufficient to incense Imperial Wisdom, but his Youth might plead Excuse, and for his Rashness interceed; Therefore entreated that he would recal His Prescript, and be reconcil'd withal; Adding, an Act so generous and kind Would work so strongly on the Paulsgrave's Mind, That he'd be careful to no more displease, But recompence his past Miscarriages. In such a Style, and to that peaceful End, Did the King's Message to the German tend, But yet the baulk'd Ambassador fell short Of what was aim'd at by the English Court; For all the Answer that the Agent bore His Royal Master from the Emperor, Was, that the Diet were at present met On Bus'ness most importunately great, Such that respected the Imperial Throne, And the Affairs of Germany alone, Which call'd for haste, and were of too much weight, T'admit of Foreign Matters in debate, But that his Master should, at leisure, find Returns, they hop'd, according to his Mind. The Cause that made the Emperor so cold, Was, that the King did Correspondence hold With Sweden's Monarch, then prepar'd with Horse And Foot, to enter Germany by force, That Valiant Prince, Gustavus Adolphus., who was born T'Imperial Greatness, a perplexing Thorn, The German Empire being grown too high, And stretching into boundless Tyranny; The Swede was therefore chose, as fit to low'r The dang'rous growth of the Imperial Pow'r, By Nature nobly qualify'd to be A trusty Friend and daring Enemy. This caus'd the English, French, and Dutch to join With brave Gustavus in this great Design, To gain those German Princes some redress, Who, at that juncture, were in sore distress. All things being ready for the Swede's Descent, And seeming to presage a good Event, With sev'nty Ships of War he hoisted Sail, Two hundred Transports, and a prosp'rous Gale, And conquering two Islands Rugen and Usedon. in his Way, Enter'd the Province of Pom'rania, Took the strong Town of Stetin, and restor'd The harrass'd Dukedom to its rightful Lord Bogislaus.. This happy News soon reach'd the English Throne, Well pleas'd with what the Valiant Swede had done, Resolving now to send him an encrease Of Forces, that might forward his Success, That England might her ancient use pursue, And share the Glory likely to accrue. To expedite the Work in hand, the Throne Gave a Commission to Duke Hamilton, To levy, in the Northern Parts, with speed, Six thousand Scots, to aid the gallant Swede, Giving to th'Duke the Impost of the Wines, In Scotland, to encourage these Designs, Fix'd as an annual Stipend from the Crown, For acting in this Expedition: But now the King, who was oblig'd to send Money, as well as Forces, to his Friend, Was much fatigu'd to raise a due Supply Of Treasure to support his great Ally, Having no Senate to appoint or grant A Sum sufficient for the present Want, Was therefore counsel'd, in this pressing Case, To serve his Turn by old uncommon Ways, Which never had been practis'd by the Crown, Since the Sixth Henry fill'd the English Throne. However, by the Law, in times of Yore, The King, at pleasure, had undoubted Pow'r, By his own Writ, to summon and engage All Landed Men, of full and lawful Age, Of twenty Pounds per Annum at the least, In Fee, or for the Term of Life possest, To take the Ord'r of Knighthood, or to pay A Fine, if not perform'd by such a Day: With these old Measures did the King comply, And rais'd a hundred thousand Pounds thereby, A Sum, which tho' it stood the Crown in stead, Prov'd not sufficient for the present Need: So that an Agent Mr. Walter Mountague. was dispatch'd to France, With Orders to negotiate the Advance Of the like Sum, a Moiety delay'd Of the Queen's Dower, and till then unpaid; Also to set some other Matters even, And that full Satisfaction should be given For Merchant's Ships the French upon the Seas, Had taken from the English since the Peace, Which, after some few Rubs that cross'd the way, About the Fort Kelech in Canada, Which we were bound in Justice to resign, They answer'd all the King's Demands, in fine, That th'Expedition now went briskly on, Beneath the Conduct of Duke Hamilton. Tho' costly Robes and Titles we adore, Yet Money is alone the Soul of Pow'r. About this time a bold unwary Scot Leighton., (Who, to inflame the Parliament, had wrote An odious Libel Sion's Plea., stuff'd with vile Abuse, Which he presented to the Commons-House, Inveighing 'gainst the Bishops and the Queen, Stiling them vain Idolaters therein, Affirming to the People, that they ought, As such, beneath the fifth Rib to be smote) Was Sentenc'd to be Stigmatiz'd and Whip'd, Fin'd, Pillory'd, his Lugs in publick clip'd, And his Nose slit, which he escap'd some time, By flying Justice, due to such a Crime, But was retaken soon, and underwent The utmost rigour of his Punishment, To the great trouble of the Factious Brood, Who thought the Man a Saint, his Doctrine good, And that 'twas downright Pop'ry in the Laws, To make him suffer in so just a Cause, Tho' the vile Malice of the Book was such, That a worse Sentence scarce had prov'd too much, For he that seeks the Fall of those that Rule, Ought to be punish'd both as Knave and Fool. The Popish Recusants now rais'd their Heads, And in more publick manner told their Beads, Their Priests were also very active grown, In furthering their own Religion, And seem'd as pert and bold, as if some new Engaging Prospect offer'd to their view: Nor were their English Seedlings forc'd to Rome Or France, for they were now Ordain'd at home. The Pope, in favour to his distant Friends, As well as for his own more pious Ends, Having sent o'er the Bishop Titular Doctor Smith. Of Calcedon to bless the People here, And to ordain good store of Priests, in hope To re-reform these Nations to the Pope; But undertaking also to approve And appoint Regulars, and to remove Such as were standing Confessors before, Sent by the Jesuits Approbation o'er, This, by that Order, was believ'd to be A great abuse to their Authority, Who therefore caus'd the most esteem'd of those That did the Jesuits Interest espouse, T'assert the Regulars had Pow'r to do Whate'er the Prelate here pretended to, And fully to remonstrate and declare, There was no need of any Bishop here. But in the height of this Dispute between The Churchmen, the Embassador from Spain Fav'ring the Jesuits Cause, had made the King Acquainted with their private Bickering, Who, by his Royal Proclamation put A speedy Period to their warm Dispute, And made the frighted Bishop glad to fly To France, to shun the Danger that was nigh. Nor were they only thus audacious here, But did in Dublin more perverse appear, And when the Judges were at Pray'rs would meet Just by at Mass, their Pride was grown so great. Which daring and provoking Insolence, Gave all the Magistrates so great Offence, That the Archbishop, May'r, and many more Grave Persons, such as were the chief in Pow'r, Went in a Body, and thought fit to seize Their Crucifixes, Copes, and Chalices, Committed sev'ral Priests for their Offence, And Fryers, to the Care of Pursivants, Who, as they did their Prisoners convey Along the Streets, were pelted by the way; Which rude Assault so highly did displease The Bishop, and incense the Justices, That, in a little time, they seiz'd upon All their Religious Houses for the Crown; And to prevent like Insults and Affronts, By lawful Courses, check'd their Pride at once. Thus will all Priests, as well as those of Rome, Proudly exalt their Horn where'er they come, Disturb the Peace, and stretch beyond the Laws, To propagate their own Religious Cause. The End of the Sixth Year. THE Earl of Holland's CHARACTER. The younger Brother of a Noble Race, Comely of Stature, beautiful in Face; To France, when young, he travel'd where he staid, Till more Polite by Foreign Converse made, From thence, in time of War, to Holland went, Where three Campaigns the youthful Hero spent, And slighting Ease, from slothful Habits free, Intended Arms should his Profession be: But after he had wasted divers Years In the French Court, and the Batavian Wars, He took a Winter's Leisure to come o'er And see his Kindred on his Native Shore, Where pleas'd and dazl'd with the great Resort, And peaceful Splendor of King James's Court, He chang'd his first Resolves, and rather chose A Courtier's Life, than to contend with Foes, Where Streams of Blood, distinguish'd from the guilt Of Murder, are, in quest of Glory, spilt. About this time young Buckingham was grown The only darling Fav'rite of the Throne, By him, the gallant Youth, of whom we treat, Was much esteem'd for his facetious Wit, And winning Presence, till at length he gain'd Th'aspiring Duke to be his faithful Friend, Wisely relying wholly on His Grace, For all Advancements into Pow'r and Place, Declining, as the surest way to rise, All other Favours to depend on his, Which so engag'd the Duke, that he was proud To serve his Friend, and to promote his good; For as the bounteous Monarch prov'd more kind To Buckingham, still Rich advanc'd behind, And underneath his Patron's soaring Wing, Was nurs'd and rais'd as t'other by the King, Avoiding all suspicion that the Throne, Of the two Friends, affected more than one, Lest Rival Jealousy should change the Scene, And sowre the Duke's kind Amity to Spleen. For Friendship 'twixt the Great must ticklish stand, Whilst one, of Right, assumes the upper-hand. Besides, the Pow'rful do too often slight Those gen'rous Friends who rais'd 'em to their hight, And with unjust Returns past Services requite. But Rich, in his Advance, was still too good, To stain his Honour with Ingratitude; And tho' his narrow Fortune, for a while, Had some Dependance on his Friend Carlisle, 'Twixt whom the ties of Love were much too great, To be dissolv'd by any Pow'r but Fate, Yet would he seek no Favour from the Throne, By means of any but the Duke alone, And to his Friendship and his Goodness ow'd, Whate'er the Crown upon his Youth bestow'd, Would scarce without him, with the King, be seen, But rather chose t'ingratiate with the Queen, Whose weak uncertain Int'rest in the Throne, The Duke had less regard to than his own, And therefore valu'd not how far his Friend Did on her Female Royalty depend. To add one Comfort tow'rds a happy Life, The Duke preferr'd him to a wealthy Wife, By which auspicious Match he made his own, The Mannor and the Seat of Kensington; And, to join Honour to his worthy Name, Was soon created Baron of the same. Then, at the Duke's Request, promoted near The Prince of Wales, and after, from a Peer, Made Earl of Holland, Captain of the Guard, Knight of the Garter, and as soon preferr'd To th'Privy-Council, where he took his Place, And flourish'd in the Friendship of His Grace. Was sent the first Embassador to France, To treat about the Marriage of the Prince. And when, by the Supream Authority, The Duke was sent into the Isle of Rhee, He left the Earl in full Command behind, O'er all that Army for Recruits design'd. In this good Posture, and on this high Ground He stood, when Buckingham receiv'd his Wound, Beholding, from his own advance to Pow'r, The Fall of Greatness from a loftier Tow'r; Yet, by Ambition spurr'd, 'twas now his Aim, To climb that very Pinacle of Fame, From whence the Duke, tho' guarded by the Crown, Had fall'n, with strange precipitation, down: And having also made the Queen his Friend, An Honour which His Grace had ne'er obtain'd, Th'aspiring Earl endeavour'd now to soar As high as Buckingham had flown before, Using his utmost Policy in State, To make the Queen's Authority more great, That by Her Means he might approach the Throne, And by Her Int'rest there confirm his own, Engaging daily in an open War, With Portland's Earl, who then was Treasurer; Opposing all Men to a warm degree, That were not gracious with Her Majesty, Receiving e'ery Day, beneath her Wing, Fresh Gifts and Obligations from the King, Till, by large Flights, he did, at length, aspire To's great a height as he could well desire, And flourish'd, whilst the Weather prov'd serene, In a bless'd Medium 'twixt the King and Queen. But when the Storm arose he chang'd apace, Shewing the World an unexpected Face; And, tho' intrusted with Command, declin'd That Honour most thought rooted in his Mind; And, by his Conduct, rather seem'd intent To back the Int'rest of the Parliament; Tho' he, at length, retracted, when he saw They forc'd the Bounds of Reason and of Law, Join'd all his Int'rest, did an Army raise, To serve his Royal Master in Distress; But, thro' Mismanagement, was routed soon, At Kingston, and his good Design undone, And to St. Neots, for safety, being fled, Was, in his Inn, surpris'd, and Pris'ner made, Where he remain'd confin'd, till, to prevent Escape, he was to Warwick-Castle sent, There strictly kept, till the Rebellious Court Had made the best of Princes Lives their Sport. And then, to satiate the revengeful Hate Of Traytors, who condemn'd their Foes in State, Was doom'd to share his Royal Master's Fate. Thus when the Factious Herd usurp the Pow'r, The Greatest and most Just are least secure; For Rebels never to Dominion rise, But Vertue falls a bleeding Sacrifice. THE Earl of Essex's CHARACTER. Tho' none could stricter Loyalty profess, Yet none, in time of Need, declin'd to less; Punctual to Honour's Rules he steer'd his Course, When young, as if the Flattery or Force Of all Temptations, were too weak to draw His Soul beside Religion and the Law; But the new Doctrines that the Times advanc'd, And Notions by the Commons countenanc'd, Stagger'd his Reason, did his Judgment blind, And, in the end, seduc'd his yielding Mind; For whilst he thought he knew what Treason was, No Peer could more abhor the Rebel's Cause: But, by their Subtilties, at length, deceiv'd, He lost the Truth, and with the Croud believ'd; And when his injur'd Prince was low in Pow'r, Like forward Fruit corrupted at the Core, Drop'd from the Royal Tree that cherish'd him before. No Courage did he want, by Sea or Land, Nor Pride to be desirous of Command, And, thro' unfinish'd Brav'ry, had the Fau't To aim at mighty Things, but scarce knew what: Not that Ambition spurr'd him to be Great In Title, or presiding in the State, For sake of Wealth or Honour, but to seem Deserving of the Government's Esteem. As certain Fops court Beauties of Renown, Not for the Joy, but to be smil'd upon, That other Beaus may envy what they share, And think 'em much more happy than they are; So 'twas the Pride of Essex to be thought Worthy of Favours which his Rivals sought. In Friendship he delighted to be Just, And nothing more abhorr'd than Breach of Trust, Scorning ignoble Practises with those He'd even cause enough to treat as Foes: Nor could the most prevailing Friend have drawn His stedfast Loyalty from Church and Throne, Had not those nice Distinctions then in play, First made his Conscience to the Schools give way, And caus'd him, in the midst of Heats and Jars, To quit his Judgment to rely on theirs. For when the Pulpit and the Press revolt, Well may the Laity 'twixt Opinions halt, Or be misled into a dang'rous Fault. Justice, as measur'd by his erring Sence, None could approve with greater Reverence, Or, for the same, in Publick Matters be A more industrious Advocate than he: Nor did he, thro' Disgust or Pride, forsake The Royal Cause, but barely thro' Mistake, Hoping, in time, that his Revolt might prove As useful as his Loyalty and Love. For tho' he fought against him, some agree, He'd no dishonour tow'rds His Majesty, But, if he'd had the Conduct, would have done By th'injur'd Father, what befel the Son. But little Thanks are due to such a Friend, Who make things worse, that they, at last, may mend. The interwoven Characters of Sir John Coke and Sir Dudly Carleton, Joint Secretaries of State. Tho' we these great Twin-Officers unite, They differ'd in their Parts as black from white. Coke, by his long Experience, understood Bus'ness at home, but no Affairs abroad; The other, vice versa, skill'd alone In Foreign Countries, ign'rant of his own. So that, betwixt 'em both, they made up one Wise Officer of State to serve the Throne; For what one understood not, as he shou'd, And could not manage well, the other cou'd. Coke, in his Youth, at Cambridge had been bred, But had a Rural Life, in private, led, Till he arriv'd to Fifty Years of Age, Before he enter'd on the Publick Stage: And having, for Industry, gain'd a Name, Set off and heighten'd with an honest Fame, Was to some Navy-Office Post, where Pains And Probity were wanting, more than Brains, Preferr'd; from thence, made Master of Requests; And, after that, did many Years possess His last high Station, which (as most agree) He manag'd with no great Sufficiency, B'ing rather unadorn'd with Parts that might Deserve the Epithets of quick or bright, And unendow'd with any Excellence Of Mind, than noted for defect of Sence; So that he'd little to be much esteem'd, And no notorious Faults to be condemn'd, Downright Industry being thought by all That knew the Man, his Vertue Cardinal, And love of Money, the prevailing Vice, Which, above others, he had made his choice. Thus thriv'd and lengthen'd out his Span, between His Fav'rite Vertue and his darling Sin, Growing, before he dy'd, so Rich and Old, That had his silver Hairs been justly told, They'd scarce have prov'd so num'rous as his Bags of Gold. Carleton in Christ-Church, Oxford, had been bred, Where he, betimes, a pregnant Wit displaid, Only a Student there, who stood upon No other Ground than the Foundation: But he, from thence, went early into France, Where his Parts soon procur'd him an Advance; For, by Sir Henry Nevil, who before Resided there, from hence Embassador, He was chose Secretary, where he got So much Experience, and such great Repute, That he himself, in the same Post, was sent To Venice, where he long was Resident; And in that Station did himself deport So well, that soon as he return'd to Court, In the like Trust he was employ'd again, And, to the States of Holland, cross'd the Main, Where he resided when that Synod join'd At Dort, which since hath fill'd the World, we find, With all that Strife, Dispute and Discontent, Which they were call'd together to prevent. Nor did th'Embassador in that Affair, Deal rightly by his Royal Master here, But by the Arts he practis'd with his Prince, Has drawn upon the World some Evils since. However, when King James had left his Throne, That careful Blessing, to his Royal Son, Carleton once more Extraord'nary was sent, By Charles, to that Republick Government, And was the last Embassador from us, That sate and voted in their Senate-House, An Honour granted to the English Crown, For what Eliza for the States had done; But when the Dutch were wealthy grown, and proud, That freedom by the States was disallow'd, A Privilege we might have boasted still, Had we but kept back Flushing and the Brill. When, to his Honour, he had thus employ'd Much time in publick Embassies abroad, He then was summon'd to the Council-Board, Was Secretary made, and next a Lord, When his Estate was so obscurely small, That, at that time, it scarce was visible. This was the last good Office that the Great Unhappy Duke perform'd, before his Fate Was finish'd by that base ill-natur'd Hand, That damn'd itself to please a murm'ring Land. Thus some to Honour climb, who live to see Their envy'd Patron's sad Catastrophe, And scarce, perhaps, have Gratitude to own The Acts of Bounty he has done, when gone. A.D. 1631. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Seventh Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1631. The Fav'rite Scot Marquis of Hamilton., Commission'd to support The Swede, was now beneath a Cloud at Court, Which, by his stedfast Int'rest with the Throne, In spight of Envy, soon was overblown, Although accus'd by the Lord Rhees Mackey, Of ill Designs against His Majesty: Which Matter, 'twixt the Marquis and the Lord, To certain Peers was, by the King, referr'd; But the Dispute was hush'd and laid aside, When most believ'd the Cause would have been try'd By Combat, the Accuser having none To prove the Plot, in Embrio, 'gainst the Throne, Besides himself, whose Honour was not thought Sufficient, without further Proof was brought. So that the Lord Mackey, who bore Command In the Scotch Forces, with the Swedish join'd, Was, by the Lords Commissioners, dismiss'd; And thus the Contest of a sudden ceas'd, The King restoring Hamilton to Pow'r, And all the Favours he enjoy'd before: That if the Accusation was unjust, His Worth might shake off the invidious Dust; If to ignoble Treachery inliclin'd, Kindness might win him from the Ills design'd. For still confiding in a Person blam'd For Infidelity, has oft reclaim'd The Guilty, from the wicked Schemes they've fram'd. Mervin, Lord Audley, for an impious Fact, Too black to name, and horrible to act, Was, in the Spring April 25., indicted and arraign'd Before his Peers, and for the same condemn'd, Accus'd by his own Children and his Wife, And sentenc'd by his Peers to lose his Life, Which he, in May, on Tower-Hill, resign'd, Unpity'd by the best of humane-kind, A Punishment too little for the Crimes He long had practis'd in those sinful Times, Till Justice brought him to that fatal Place, The Scaffold, where the Ax cut short his Days, And left his Mem'ry odious to all humane Race. In July foll'wing Hamilton the Scot, Arriv'd i'th' Oder A River running thro' Brandenburgh., with Six thousand Foot, All well accouter'd, from Distemper free, Suitably furnish'd with Artillery, Three hundred thousand Dollars to supply The Sweden Monarch then in Germany. The Marquis waiting on the King himself, Whose Leaguer was at Werben on the Elve, Where, after he'd receiv'd his welcome Guest, With all Respect that could be well exprest, He shew'd the Works he'd rais'd about the Town, To guard and fortify the Garison Against Count Tilly, who had march'd a great And pow'rful Force so near as Wilmestat: So that Gustavus, to the Marquis made A short Apology, wherein he said, He had not leisure then to give so kind A Welcome, to the Marquis, as design'd, Adding, that he was sorry in his Heart, He was arriv'd in such a barren part, Where both the Armies, for a Twelvemonth's space, Had lain, and much impoverish'd the Place; But well assur'd his Lordship he should find, In a short time, good Quarters to his Mind; So form'd Instructions for the Noble Scot, To join his Army with the Foot he'd brought, Who being then dismiss'd, soon march'd away To th'Camp, where all the Swedish Forces lay, But Plague and Famine, those destructive Foes, Among the Scots, unitedly arose, And swept 'em off by hundreds in a Week, Some hourly dying, others falling Sick, But those who had the Fortune to survive, Fearless of slaughter, fought like Men alive. Thus Kings, their Royal Neighbours to befriend, In humble Crowds their hardy Subjects lend, Whilst others, who themselves from danger skreen, Triumph in Spoils the starving Wretches win. Nor were these Succours of themselves alone, A timely strengthning of the Swedish Throne, But when the other Neighb'ring Princes saw The King of England in the Quarrel draw, Many, who neuter stood before, were free And glad to join in the Confed'racy. For tho' we deem it but a cow'rdly Pride, In Peasants, to abett the strongest side, Yet Kings and Princes daily do the same, But they're above the reach of common Blame. Their Ills are painted to deceive our view, And Pow'r gives Sanction to whate'er they do. No sooner had the Marquis join'd the Swede With Forces he had rais'd beyond the Tweed, But Royal Charles advisedly sent o'er Sir Harry Vane, as his Embassador, Who soon arriv'd at Wertzburg, on the Mane, Where he (attended with a num'rous Train) Refresh'd a while, and then departed thence For Frankfort Town, in great Magnificence, Which German City had, but just before, Freely surrender'd to the Swedish Pow'r, And op'ning all their Gates, huzzaing bid A joyful Welcome to the Royal Swede; To this submission being chiefly brought, By that successful Battle he had fought At Leipsick, where he made the Germans fly, And flush'd his new Allies with Victory. How easy do the Fortunate and Brave Hunt down the Weak, and passive Crowds enslave. At Frankfort now Gustavus held his Court, Thither his Queen, in Splendor, had resort; Thither the Marquis Hamilton repair'd, Nobly attended with a pompous Guard; Thither the injur'd Palsgrave had recourse, Protected by a splendid Guard of Horse; Thither the French Embassador was sent, In State, to pay his Master's Compliment, And to negotiate a more strict and near Alliance with the Sweden God of War; And there, surrounded with a glorious Train, The Swede gave Audience to Sir Harry Vane; But hearing that some Troops of Spanish Horse, Join'd with some Flemings to augment their Force, New-rais'd at Luxemburg, were march'd from thence, To recruit Wormes, Frankendal, and Mentz, And other Garisons that were of great Importance, Towns in the Palatinate. This forc'd the Royal Hero to defer The Negotiation to pursue the War; Who hasten'd to his Army with design, Forthwith to break up Camp and pass the Rhine; In order to accomplish which, away He march'd his Troops, and by the River lay, Before a Sconce, well fortify'd with wide Deep Dikes, or Fosses, by the Rhine supply'd With Water; over which, for further strength, Was built a Drawbridge, many Yards in length; Before this Fort, by German Foes possess'd, The King commanded Batteries to be rais'd, Leaving a Reg'ment, and an old Brigade Of sturdy Scots, to block up the Blockade, Whilst others were employ'd to empty Boats The Foe had sunk, in which two thousand Scots First pass'd the River, that they might possess And cover a convenient Landing-place, The Valiant Hero foll'wing with the rest, Excepting those that did the Sconce invest, And, in a Body, unexpected came, Before the Garison of Oppenheim. A Town that lay direct against the Fort, By Hiphurn's and by Wrinkle's Two Scotch Colonels. Scots begirt; Which Fortress, when they found the King had past The Rhine, with such security and haste, And that his Army was before the Town That must sustain 'em, they surrender'd soon; The Valiant Monarch having like Success, In a few Weeks, against the other Place, Marching about victoriously, in State, Running quite over the Palatinate; By uncontroul'd good Fortune conqu'ring all The Towns but Heidelburg and Frankendal. Thus, reaping Glory in the Field of Mars, We'll leave him, and return to Home-Affairs, That we may see how Charles the Good declin'd, Whilst Great Gustavus like a Comet shin'd. Five Years before this time there was advanc'd A crafty Project, highly countenanc'd, Impow'ring certain Feoffees to receive Moneys of such as were dispos'd to give, In order that the Sums so rais'd about The Countries, should be carefully laid out In purchase of Impropriations, round The Kingdom, where the same on Sale were found, That Preaching Ministers might be maintain'd, In setting up new Lectures through the Land, In all such heath'nish Places, where 'twas thought The People, from the Church, liv'd too remote, Were therefore wholly ign'rant of their good, Unpolish'd, brutish, irreligious, rude, And did no Gospel-Duties understand, For want of having Sermons nearer hand, And that, by their good Methods such should be Instructed well in Christianity. This Project, bearing such a pious Face, Took with all those that boasted much of Grace, And made them, with a lib'ral hand, promote The bless'd Design, so timely set on foot, When Pop'ry and the Devil too were known To lurk in Holes and Corners up and down, As Faction cry'd, to worry and devour The godly Saints, with their united Pow'r; Therefore they elbow'd on, with all their Might, This new Device of spreading Gospel-Light, That 'twas believ'd their Project would have grown So fast, that half a Cent'ry would have shown, They'd rather wanted Purchases than Coin, They had so deeply laid the good Design. But the King being of the Scheme appriz'd, And by his Privy-Council well advis'd, That if 'twas suffer'd to be carry'd on, 'Twould be destructive both to Church and Throne, Noy, the Attorney-Gen'ral, had command To prosecute the Feoffees out of hand, In the Exchequer-Chamber, by a Bill That drove their climbing Project down the Hill, And ruin'd all, as in the foll'wing Year, The fatal Issue will, at large, appear. Thus Holy Projects, founded upon Grace, Have always something in 'em that is base, If carry'd on without the due consent Or sanction of the Legal-Government. Not but the Crafty may, by Arts, delude Some that mean well, to think their Schemes are good; For 'tis the most authentick of all Rules, With Pious Knaves t'impose on Pious Fools. The End of the Seventh Year. Duke Hamilton's CHARACTER. A noble Scot, who had imbib'd his share Of cold, but crafty Caledonian Air, Furnish'd with Qualities of e'ery sort That well adorn'd him for a Prince's Court, And made him seem deserving of those Boons Which most Men covet that attend on Thrones. By these prevailing Arts he soon obtain'd Credit at Court, and made the King his Friend, Was sent with Forces to sustain the Swede, And Money to supply that Monarch's Need, When with the Germans he'd begun a War, And prosp'rously surpris'd the Emperor: But in this Expedition Hamilton Was charg'd with a Design against the Throne, By David Ramsey and the Lord Mackey, The latter making the Discovery: But Hamilton returning from abroad, His Int'rest soon dispers'd the rising Cloud, And so maintain'd his Credit with the Court, That most believ'd it but a false Report. Thus Envy and Ambition spur the Great, To do those things the Noble Breast should hate; For were one guilty, he deserv'd the Blame, If Innocent, the other Lord the Shame. The King (confiding Prince) shew'd no distrust, But still believ'd his Northern Fav'rite Just, And fauter'd him so much, as if he meant To let him see he thought him Innocent: Or if he was to Treachery inclin'd, To bind him from the Ills he had design'd. For Royal Smiles, that unexpected fall, To Duty oft the wav'ring Mind recall. When that unhappy Northern Feud arose, Which soon divided England into Foes, The Fav'rite Scot was trusted to command The Royal Fleet against his Native Land; Whilst the King march'd, in Royal Grandeur, forth With a stout trusty Army tow'rds the North: And if he'd been well Counsel'd, to his good, Had nip'd the Scotch Rebellion in its Bud: But ill Advisers, or his Princely Soul, Too full of Mercy, slip'd what lost the whole. The War advancing, Royal Charles thought fit To heap more Honour on his Favourite; From Marquis made him Duke, that he might scorn To give so kind a Prince an ill return; But strive to make himself alone secure, In the true Int'rest of the Sov'reign Pow'r; And not in Times so hazardous, be won By his own Country, from the injur'd Throne. But as Kings often sacrifice their Friends, For Safety, or for more ignoble Ends: So those they most oblige are still so wise, To manage with reserve, when Storms arise. Thus some Mens Caution made the Royal Cause Appear to them more dang'rous than it was; And as they thought it bad, their Fear, in course, Of shewing open Zeal, still made it worse. This sort of Self-regard induc'd his Grace, In Scotland, to pursue such doubtful Ways, As gave the King occasion to distrust The Noble Scot, as faithless and unjust; So that the Duke returning, in the Spring, To Oxford, with his Brother Earl of Lenrick., to the King, As soon as each alighted from his Pad, Both were, by Warrant, seiz'd, and Pris'ners made: The Earl escap'd, which disoblig'd His Grace, Because his Flight gave both a guilty Face, The Duke was to Pendennis Castle sent, Where he remain'd, some time, beneath Restraint: Nor could his Grace, by all the Means he us'd, Gain his Parol, he stood so far accus'd. At length a Party of the Rebels took Pendennis-Mount, and so releas'd the Duke, Who, in Disguise, with privacy and speed, Into his Native Land, for Safety, fled, Where, in his Mansion-House, he liv'd retir'd, No Visiters, but Bosom-Friends, desir'd, With whom he seem'd extreamly to resent The hardship of his close Imprisonment. And thus he dwelt reserv'd and unimploy'd, As if not much concern'd for either Side, Till the Scotch Parliament thought fit to raise An Army for the King in great Distress, Tho' to keep Scotland, rather than the Throne, From being by the Rebels over-run. O'er these Scotch Forces, for the King's Relief, The Duke was chosen General in Chief; Who enter'd England with the same, but soon Was, to his great dishonour, overthrown By Cromwel, with a much inferior Force, Taken himself, and routed Foot and Horse, And so behav'd himself, that every Side Condemn'd him as a Person stupify'd. Thus mighty Men, divided in themselves, Steer those they govern upon Rocks and Shelves; For Thousands on His Grace's Side were slain. When Cromwel scarce lost half a hundred Men. The Duke was kept close Pris'ner till the King Had undergone his final Suffering; Then, by the same unprecedented Court, Was doom'd to be the Rabble's dreadful Sport; For which last Conflict being well prepar'd, He grac'd the Scaffold in the Palace-Yard, Where with his Fate he decently comply'd, And, like a calm and humble Christian dy'd. Thus when a Kingdom is in pieces rent, And Rebels war with Church and Government, The safest way is to be firm and just, For he that changes Sides no Side will trust. Mr. Attorney-General Noy's CHARACTER By his quick Parts and Learning in the Laws Early he won a general Applause, Which made the Court solicitous to gain, In factious Times, so good a Partizan, Whose great Abilities were such, that none Were better qualify'd to serve the Throne; Yet none seem'd less importunate than he To climb thereby into Authority: So that the Ministry, who knew their want Of such an Agent in the Government, Were forc'd to court him into that imploy, Which all Men labour'd to procure, but Noy, Honour and Profit being thought by most, Sufficient Baits to tempt to such a Post; But his moroseness made him rather slight What others would have tug'd for if they might. However, being humour'd, he comply'd To take, what few or none would have deny'd: Nor did he fail, when he was thus aspir'd, To do the Court what Service they desir'd, Framing that Project founded upon Soap, As odious to the People as the Pope, A new unpractis'd Model, with intent To raise Supplies without a Parliament: He also drew the Writ with his own Hand, For Ship-Money, which so incens'd the Land: Nor did he scruple, after he'd the Call To th'Station of Attorney-General, Any Compliance to oblige the Court, Altho', sometimes, it did his Sov'reign hurt, Making it chiefly his unwary Pride, To give for Law what other Men deny'd, As if he fancy'd that the only way To seem more knowing in the Laws than they. Thus he that does command a Scholar's Mouth, By learn'd Deceits too often conquers Truth. In his Behaviour he was stern and strange, Nor did the Court his sordid Manners change, For he delighted always to express Himself with an affected Surliness: Would flatter no Man, yet himself would bear The fawning Froth of each Court-Flatterer; Who finding his blind-side, did, by that means, Screw him and work him up to their Designs. For he that's proud conceits he merits Praise, And claims much Homage, tho' he little pays. In short, altho' his quick discerning Parts Wanted no Learning or Scholastick Arts, Yet was he thought the most (if Truth's no Crime) Unanswerable Iustance of his Time; Against the Rules of Reason often strove, When neither Duty led nor Safety drove, But fond of Smiles and fearless of Disgrace, Took pleasure in the most uncommon ways. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Harry Vane, The Father. By Nature of a course unfinish'd Mold, Of slender Parts, but boisterous and bold; A Person who supply'd the want of Sence, With an austere undaunted Confidence; And great Industry, Diligence, and Care, His highest Gifts and only Vertues were; By means of which he did himself support, Beneath a useful Character at Court, And riggl'd into Office by those Arts Despis'd by Men of more deserving Parts; Yet wanted Thought and Conduct to secure Himself from the Contempt of Men in Pow'r; So that he oft was punish'd by those Feuds, Which end in sudden Court-Vicissitudes, And had not Prudence to avoid the Shame Of being mortify'd by Buckingham: But when the Duke was hurry'd off the Stage, By Felton's vile enthusiastick Rage, The Knight made Friends, and was again receiv'd At Court, from whence 'twas commonly believ'd, His Grace (before the fatal Blow) and he Had reconcil'd their former Enmity; Because the King no Favour shew'd to those Who'd been his great unhappy Favourite's Foes; But forward Vane, when Buckingham was dead, Of the King's Houshold was Comptroller made, And to the Council call'd; which former Place He manag'd well, and with a comely Grace; And if he'd never been advanc'd from thence, He'd prov'd a better Subject to his Prince: But when remov'd to that unequal Post Of Secretary, he was drown'd and lost, Wanting sufficient Learning to appear Deserving of so eminent a Sphere; Which caus'd himself to say, he did account The same was offer'd as a gross Affront, Knowing his own Abilities were short Of so polite a Station in the Court: However, he comply'd and undertook The same, at length, succeeding Sir John Coke, Not only to the damage of the Throne, In Strafford's Death, but also to his own: Which Lord, by some Excursions of his Wit, Had wantonly, by chance, provok'd the Knight, So far that he became the most morose And worst of Bloodhounds in the Factious House, That help'd to hunt down that unhappy Peer, With whom the Rebel-Pack were so severe. But tho' Sir Harry run so vile a Chase, To gratify himself, and those as base, And with the rest did equal Malice vent Against the Church and Regal Government, At last he fell beneath the vile Reproach And Scorn of those he had oblig'd so much, Dying despis'd of all Sides, and of none More slighted and contemn'd than by his Son. Thus base Ingratitude, that impious Stain, Odious to Gods, and so abhor'd of Men, Goes seldom, with the Guilty, to the Grave Unpunish'd, by the Wicked or the Brave. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Harry Vane, the Son. A man of subtle and facetious Wit, Of Flatt'ry full, no stranger to Deceit; At Oxford Magdalen-College., in his Youth, some years had spent, Beneath a careful Doctor's Management; But could not, with that strictness as he ought, Conform his Life to what his Tutor taught. From thence, his Education to advance, He cross'd the Seas, and spent some time in France; But more at that too near unhappy place, Geneva, where the Saints abound in Grace; And there the Knight contracted so severe An Odium to the Church establish'd here, That with her Rites he ne'er could be at Peace, Or, to a liking, change his Prejudice. His Conscience thus infected and diseas'd, At which his Father then seem'd much displeas'd, He could not long remain, at Home, content, But to that Pious Place, New-England, went, Where all Enthusions sow'd their envious Seeds, And jarring Faiths grew wild, like stinking Weeds, That by transplanting what those Zealots nurs'd, The World, in time, might be compleatly curs'd. However, with Proviso they would take Those Oaths Of Allegiancee and Supremacy. they always took delight to break, They, by their Charter, then had Pow'r to chuse What Governours and Laws they pleas'd to use. No sooner had the Knight set Foot upon The Indian Shore, and made his Vertues known, But the fond Saints his pregnant Parts admir'd, And paid him what respect could be desir'd; The more, because inform'd, e're he came o'er, His Father was a Privy-Counsellor, Which, probably, to his advantage prov'd, And made him more caress'd and more belov'd; For when that wise enthusiastick State Thought fit to change their Ruling-Magistrate, They chose Sir Harry to the Seat of Pow'r, And made the crafty Knight their Governour: But he no sooner had possess'd his Place, E're working Fancy, so o'erflow'd with Grace, That he advanc'd a thousand Scruples more Than e'er had plagu'd their Consciences before; That they, at length, withdrawing their Esteem, And he as much dissatisfy'd with them, Quitted his Honour, bid the Saints adieu, And for Old-England thus abandon'd New, Leaving the Zealots mis'rably betray'd, Into strange Factions he himself had made; Which still were widen'd by intemp'rate Zeal, Till Persecution scourg'd their Commonweal The only Blessing giddy Nations find Such politick Reformers leave behind. He now had learn'd with gravity to hide His inward Cunning, Levity, and Pride, And had so much reform'd his homely Face A Person of uncouth Aspect., That e'ery Look seem'd rectify'd by Grace, Whilst his strange Aspect promis'd something more Than had been done by humane Race before. The Father pleas'd to find his Son reclaim'd, And hoping he that Lyon-Lust had tam'd, In a few Months was careful to provide His crafty Heir a fair and wealthy Bride; And by his pow'rful Int'rest with the Lord High-Admiral Earl of Northumberland., rais'd him at the Navy-Board, And with Sir William Russel join'd him there, A Partner in the Post of Treasurer, Where he continu'd seemingly content, Both with Church-Discipline and Government; Till Strafford, either in contempt or spight, Thought fit to circumvent the Elder Knight Of Graby Barony, which long had been An Honour in the ancient House of Vane; And therefore was the most engaging Boon That could have pleas'd Sir Harry and his Son; Who both, upon this Disappointment, vow'd Revenge on whom the Favour was bestow'd: And from that time the younger join'd with Pym, And all the Faction that cabal'd with him, Contributed whate'er he could, to bring The Earl to his untimely Suffering; Join'd with the Parliament against the Crown, And wanted to have Root and Branch cut down; Manag'd the Scots with so much Art and Wit, That he deceiv'd those Mongers in Deceit, And brought the Loons to Covenant with those Who were their Idol-Kirk's invet'rate Foes; And he himself, soon after, let 'em see, That none abhor'd Presbyt'ry more than he, Who had, in short, been all that could be wrong, And stuck to nothing, but Rebellion, long. Thus he that once has run so far astray, As to be pleas'd with his erroneous way, Does the true Road to Happiness despise, And in a Desart wanders till he dies. A.D. 1632. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Eighth Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1632. Th' Exchequer-Prosecution, by the Crown, Against the Feoffees, now went warmly on, They being charg'd that they had misapply'd The Money rais'd, and giv'n Offence beside, In chusing Nonconformist Guides to teach The People, Men not qualify'd to Preach: Nor was the Feoffment legal, had it been Their Care to've kept the Articles therein; For that the fair-fac'd Project was of great Concern, and dang'rous to the Church and State. So that the Court, in spight of all Defence, Tho' strenuous were the Feoffees Arguments, Condemn'd the whole Design, dissolv'd the Trust, As arbitrary, lawless, and unjust, Confiscated their Money to the Crown, And thus the Pious Project was undone. This gave two diff'rent sorts of People cause To charge Injustice on the Crown and Laws, Those that meant well, and only saw half way, And those that had a deeper Game to play; For tho' it carry'd an inviting Face, 'Twas plain to wiser Heads the End was base. Most of the Scots, sent over to the Swede, Of Pestilence and Famine now were dead, That the surviving few, whom Death had spar'd, By Hamilton, were scarce thought worth regard: So that from Camp to Holland he adjourn'd, And in September to the Court return'd. The Royal Swede, Victorious in the Field, E're now had sev'ral Consultations held With the young injur'd Palsgrave of the Rhine, And our Embassador, Sir Harry Vane; In which Affair that did in chief relate To th'Swede's regaining the Palatinate. The French and Dutch Embassadors took care To mediate Matters so extreamly fair, That the whole Bus'ness ('twas by all Sides thought) Would to a happy Issue soon be brought. But when the Cause had been thus far pursu'd, And all things in a hopeful Posture stood, A Battle 'twixt the German and the Swede, At Lutzen, did the wish'd for End impede, For in that memorable Fight the Great Gustavus, in his Glory met his Fate; At first dismounted by a Gunshot Wound, Then by his Stirrup drag'd along the Ground, Beating the Surface with his Royal Head, Until a second Bullet struck him dead. Thus Fate too often disappoints the Brave, And lays 'em level with the scoundrel Slave. But he had left that Day (as some report) His Armour off, to ease a former Hurt, And charging too precipitately fierce, A Body of Imperial Curasiers Horsemen in Armour., Was forc'd, at last, by their impetuous Fire, With few of his own Followers to retire, And in his wheeling off from his Attack, Was shot by a Carbine into the Back, And left ignobly by the Chief Piccolomini. that led; The Curasiers intomb'd beneath the Dead, Who lay in heaps confus'dly overthrown, Debasing Royal Purple with their own. Thus the Brave Hero, who in Battle dies, Disguis'd and mangl'd, undistinguish'd lies. Others report his Death a diff'rent way, Especially the Swedes themselves, who say, The German Duke of Lauwenburg, who join'd The Emp'ror, stab'd him with his Sword behind, Knowing that Prince's Death would turn the Tide, And give advantage to the losing Side. But tho' the manner of his being slain, Among Historians, does in doubt remain, Yet all agree, that in the Lutzen Field Of Battle the Victorious Swede was kill'd. Which sad surprising Tidings, when disclos'd To th'Palsgrave, who had been much indispos'd, Tho' near recover'd, forc'd him to his Bed, And, like a Bolt of Thunder, struck him dead, That those Affairs, which look'd so well of late, Were by this double Blow made desperate. Who then with too much confidence would steer, Because the Coast looks promising and clear, Since Fate is oft so changably severe. Now Viscount Wentworth Afterwards Lord Strafford., of the King, obtain'd The sole Command of the Hibernian Land, Which was in great disorder by the means Of restless Priests and Popish Insolence, The Roman Irish having been too free In trespassing on Royal Clemency, Mistaking, to their Hurt, as well as Blame, When meer Compassion was the Prince's Aim, A dispensation of some Penal Laws, To be a firm adherence to their Cause, A misconstruction they are apt to make, When Sov'reign Pow'r holds the Rein too slack. So foolish Girls think every Man would be Their Spouse, that treats them with Civility. And the poor Criminal who stands arraign'd, Believes the Judge that speaks him fair, his Friend. The King with the Small-Pox was seiz'd this Year On the ad of September., Which did so kind and favourably appear, That, without danger, he recover'd soon, To th'Joy of all affected to the Throne: But a much worse Distemper in the North, Among the Scots, unhappily broke forth, Which unexpected Pestilent Disease Infected neighb'ring England by degrees, Till the Three Kingdoms felt, at length, the smart, And nurs'd the growing Plague till sick at Heart, Rais'd and fomented first by Legal-Suits, The King commenc'd against some Noble Scots, Who, from the Crown, had got into their Hands, Divers Estates in Church and Abby-Lands, Settl'd by Parliament upon the Throne, I'th' time of Northern Reformation: But in the Infant Years of James the Sixt', When Murray in the Regency was fix'd With other Lords, those Lands, by their Consent, Were alienated from the Government; Some by themselves and Relatives possest, And to their Fav'rites they dispos'd the rest; Who, without scruple, made the same free Prize, With all the old Regalities and Tythes, Keeping the Clergy so extreamly short, That their poor Stipends scarce were a support; Did also, as they pleas'd the Peasants ride, And made them wretched Vassals to their Pride. Thus when the Lords too powerful are grown, The Commons must be crush'd and trampl'd down. The Lands aforesaid having by the best O'th' Scotch Nobility been long possess'd, Held by no Title but illegal Force, And Usurpation of their Ancestors; The King, at the beginning of his Reign, Involv'd in War, that did his Coffers drain, And, at that Juncture, Scotland paying short Of what was needful for the due support Of their own Government, the Council there Advis'd the King to take some speedy care About resumption of those Tracts of Land Which from the Crown were wrongfully detain'd. This made the King endeavour to obtain An Act of Renovation, but in vain, The Tenants proving able to prevent The gaining of his Point in Parliament: After which baulk His Majesty agreed, By way of Legal Process to proceed, That a Commission was, at length, brought on, Commanding a surrender to the Crown, Of those Church-Lands the King had right to seize, With all the Tythes and Superiorities, The same to be retaken and possess'd, On such Conditions as were there express'd, That some Revenue might arise thereby, Each Year, futurely to His Majesty, And augmentations be to Churches made, Whose Clergy long had starvingly been paid, And that the common People might be eas'd, Who'd also been with galling Burthens teas'd. But the vex'd Occupants much rather chose To raise their Clans and Vassals, and expose Their Country to a vile rebellious War, Than to submit to what was just and fair. From hence those Storms did, by degrees, encrease, That rob'd Three happy Kingdoms of their Peace, Till cruel Bloodshed, Malice and Mistake, To their first savage rudeness brought 'em back, And made the Eden of the World become A Land of Murder, Theft, and Martyrdom. Thus with ill Men it is a constant course, To justify bad Deeds by doing worse, And to maintain their Frauds by open Force. The End of the Eighth Year. THE Earl of Northumberland's CHARACTER. Descended of an ancient Noble Race, Oft great at Court, tho' sometimes in Disgrace; Nor had they kept their Blood intirely free From the gross tinge of Infidelity. Yet tho' the Father had been long restrain'd, When James the Peaceful o'er the Kingdom reign'd, Forgiving Charles receiv'd the Noble Son, And warm'd him in the Sunshine of the Throne, Did first upon the gallant Youth confer The Garter, made him next a Privy. Counsellor: And when resolv'd his Navy should, by Sea, Assert his Right of Sovereignity, Gave him Command of all the English Fleet, Which, since Eliza's Reign was ne'er so great: And when more skill'd in Maritime Affairs, By short Experience of, at most, two Years, Had, from the King, a favourable Call To the great Charge of Lord-High-Admiral; Yet all these Royal Bounties that befel The youthful Peer, whose Person promis'd well, Were not sufficient to engage or bind, To steddy Maxims, an inconstant Mind, Fill'd with Ambition, and a Self-Conceit Of his own Merits, which indeed were great; For none less silly Words could ever vent, And when he spoke, no Tongue more pertinent. But had he thought the distance of the Throne, In height, as much superior to his own, As he conceiv'd his Eminence to be Above all those of equal Quality, He'd prov'd a better Subject in the End, And to his Native Land a truer Friend; But, fond of humble Rev'rence and Esteem, Was drawn by Flatt'ries from the Pow'r Supream, First to neglect those things he should have done, In Gratitude and Duty to the Crown, And then to act, incourage, and pursue Those things 'twas shameful and unjust to do, Tamp'ring in Evil-Councils to promote Rebellion, till the same was set on foot: Nor did he stop, but mov'd from bad to worse, And frankly join'd to carry on the Curse. So when fair Innocence is once insnar'd, For want of Care, to do the thing she fear'd, The itch of Nature makes her still more lewd, Till by the Vice she's totally subdu'd THE Earl of Lindsey's CHARACTER. Of Noble Extract, and of Loyal Fame, Just to his Prince, to e'ry Man the same; Awful in Person, duteous to the Throne, Would not impose, or be impos'd upon, Vig'rous and daring in the Martial Field, Of constant Courage, and in Action skill'd, Quick of Resentment, careful to preserve His Honour, and would ne'er from Honour swerve, Had often, to his Glory, bore Command, And acted with Success by Sea and Land, Was resolutely Brave at Edge-Hill Fight, And of his Life grew careless, thro' a slight, Which his great Soul resented from the Throne, Who'd superceded his Commission, By giving to Prince Rupert, just before The fatal Battle, a superior Pow'r, Which caus'd the gallant Hero to expose His Life more rashly 'gainst the Kingdom's Foes, When Essex bore Command, and misapply'd His Valour to the base rebellious Side, That in the Fight receiving Wound by Wound, To the number of eighteen. The Loyal Peer fell bleeding to the Ground, And, e're he dy'd, was taken on the Spot Pris'ner, by those he had so bravely fought, And by the Foe remov'd, where Straw became His Bed of Honour, to his endless Fame, Reproving many who around him stood, As he lay welt'ring in his cloded Blood, Exhorting them to quit their odious Cause, Maintain'd against Divine and Humane Laws, Requesting in his dying Words, that all About him would implore their General, That he'd forsake the Rebels and apply For Mercy at the Feet of Majesty. Thus like a Saint he preach'd, till with expence Of Blood his mighty Soul departed hence, Leaving the Court, and all that did depend Thereon, to mourn the Loss of such a Friend, Who was in all Heroick Gifts compleat, As Wise as Valiant, and as Just as Great. THE Lord Cottington's CHARACTER. A wise and Loyal Knight, who in the Reign Of James had been entrusted long in Spain, About the Prince's Marriage with the Fair Infanta, tho' 'twas never brought to bear: Not that the disappointment of the same Was ow'd to Cottington, but Buckingham, By whose Advice alone the Prince was sent To visit the Hispanian Government, Which, to his hazard, Cottington oppos'd, When by the King the Secret was disclos'd; But Buckingham prevailing with the Throne, And the young Prince being eager to be gone, Away they sail'd, their doubtful Voyage made, But spoil'd the Match, as Cottington had said. When James for Heaven chang'd his Earthly Crown, And Charles succeeded in his Father's Throne, Cottington then to Peerage was advanc'd, And by the King and Court much countenanc'd, Was to two gainful Stations Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Master of the Court of Wards. soon prefer'd, To help maintain the grandeur of a Lord, And manag'd both with Honour, to the great Advantage of the needy sov'reign State, Which drew the Malice of the Factious Brood Upon him, by the Methods he pursu'd, Who had improv'd the Crown's Revenue more Than any Master of the Wards before: This made the Faction cast a wishful Eye Upon that Court Of Wards. which serv'd His Majesty So highly, at a time when they were bent To curtail and reform the Government, And being well assur'd no Arts would make The steddy Lord the Royal Cause forsake, Therefore resolv'd to ravish from the Crown That Jem Court of Wards. which had so greatly serv'd the Throne, Altho' 'twas fasten'd by as firm a Law As Pow'r could make, or humane Reason draw. But when Rebellious Faction grows too strong, They no distinction make 'twixt right and wrong. One thing that render'd Cottington, at home, More odious to the Enemies of Rome, Was, that her Foes suspected him to be A private Favourer of Popery; Tho' none show'd more indifference, or less Respect to those who did her Faith profess. 'Tis true, he'd spent much time abroad in Spain, As Agent, in the Northern Monarch's Reign; And in the Winter of his Age had done Much Loyal Service for his Royal Son, Which made the Faction look the more awry Upon him, as a dang'rous Enemy. When all things here in desolation lay, And Traytors triumph'd in their bloody Day, The aged Lord to Holland was withdrawn, Whither Prince Charles was for his safety gone, Where, at the Hague in little time, they heard The dismal Tidings how the King had far'd, And that the Court of Rebels, who had torn The Monarch down, and made the Throne their scorn, Were bent to satiate their nefarious Spleen, By carrying on their sanguinary scene. This caus'd the Lord, with Grief and Age o'ergrown, For his own ease, t'advise the Royal Son To let him go Embassador to Spain In hopes to serve him in his early Reign, By interceding with the Spanish Court, To give his banish'd Sov'reign some support. The Mourning King comply'd with his desire, And sent him where he wanted to retire: Nor was he singly authoriz'd, but join'd With one who had been long his Bosom Friend. Both to the Court of Madrid sterr'd their course, Residing there whilst matters here grew worse. Also when Ascham Chancellor of the Exchequer, who to Spainwas sent As Agent from the English Parliament, By cruel daring Hands receiv'd the last Reward of all his bitter service past. Soon offer this rash vi'lence had been done, Th' Embassadors had Orders to be gone, But Cottington, depress'd with Age and Care, Desir'd he might have leave to tarry there; Which gain'd, to Validolid he retir'd, Remaining there in Peace till he expir'd. Thus when vile faction gets the upper-hand, Good men are forc'd to fly their Native Land, Whilst crafty Rebels do thier markets make Of those Estates that honest Men forsake, Rather than deviate from the sacred Rules Of Honour, to comply with Knaves and Fools. A.D. 1633 The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Ninth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1633. The King to Scotland now a Progress went, To settle there his Regal Government, Which scabby Country, barren, poor, and cold, He never had beheld since two Years old: His Passage thither was in Royal State, His Guards new-cloath'd, and his Attendance great; All his Receptions whre he din'd or lay, Magnificently Noble by the way; And ent'ring Scotland was by all the best Of Quality with humble Joy caress'd, Whilst Crouds with Acclamations fill'd the Space, And bid him Welcome to his Native Place No sooner had he bless'd the Northern Soil, Where all Degrees did on their Sov'reign smile, But all the English Officers withdrew And gave the Scots precedence, as their due, Who in their sev'ral stations did attend Their Royal master, whilst he there remain'd. In glorious Pomp, upon the tenth of June, The Monarch enter'd Edenborough Town, And to his Palace slow Advances made, Attended by a num'rous Cavalcade, Whilst duteous Crouds on e'ery side appear'd, Varnish'd with Sweat in striving to be heard. Thus do the Frape deceitfully adore Their Rulers, whilst they're prosp'rous and in Pow'r, But when ill-boding Clouds the Throne surprise, They turn their Flatt'ries to invidious Cries. In the same Month of June The 18th. the King was crown'd, And in his Northern Royal Seat enthron'd, With all the Honours that are wont to be Observ'd in such a deep Solemnity. The Parliament of Scots, soon after this, Assembl'd in their fam'd Metropolis, In due Obedience to the Sov'reign Pow'r, By whom they'd summon'd been some time before; The King b'ing now desirous to obtain An Act alluding to his Father's Reign, Such that might ratify whate'er was done By Royal James, whilst he possess'd the Throne; Accordingly the King his Mind disclos'd, And had the same in Parliament propos'd. His Pious Father, in his peaceful Days, Having attempted, by the wisest Ways, To bend the Kirk of Scotland, and incline Her Body to the English Discipline, Having so far proceeded as to fix New Bishops into thirteen Bishopricks. A glorious Work! wherein the Royal Son Was now for adding what was left undone, And therefore wanted to confirm each Point, His Father had obtain'd, by Parliament; Which was, at length effected, but with great Contention, Opposition, and Debate, Sufficient at that time to advertise The King, that he had growing Enemies, Who, when they'd opportunity to do't, Were bent to ruffle his Designs on foot, And when His Royal Presence was withdrawn, To do some Work ingrateful to the Throne. The King, however, after his return From Scotland, where he plainly might discern Some disobedient Sparkles fly abroad, Yet would not from his Purposes be aw'd; And having made old Edenborough Town A Bishop's See, which had till then been none, Dispatch'd a special Order to the Dean Of his own Chapel, that the Pray'rs therein, And Divine Worship, should futurely be According to the English Liturgy; And once a Month, with Rev'rence and Regard, The Holy Supper be administer'd, And all Communicants thereat constrain'd To take it kneeling, who were wont to stand; That if a Bishop should officiate there, He should the sacred Lawn and Rochet wear; And that no Presbyter, in Gown alone, Should give the same, without his Surplice on: All Lords that any Post of State enjoy'd, And Magistrates in lower Spheres employ'd, By the same Mandate strictly were requir'd T'attend the Worship which the King prefer'd, As oft as they could well perform the same, That others might Example take by them. Not that these Orders were at large enjoin'd, But to the Royal-Chappel first confin'd, The King expecting, when the Common-Pray'r Had current pass'd with Approbation there, That, without Feud or Contest, 'twould be soon Receiv'd in other Churches of the Town, And thro' the Land get footing by degrees, Till entertain'd in all their Parishes. As Men and Things unseen are oft cry'd down, Yet lov'd and honour'd when they're truly known. But the Scotch Kirkmen wanting not the sence, From these Efforts, to guess the Consequence, Soon turn'd their vocal Trumpets to delude The Croud, to think the King design'd no good, And taught them to believe, that his intent Was to subvert their Kirk and Government, And that his purpose was to introduce And bring the English Worship into use, Which they were well appriz'd was false and vain, Idolatrous and Popish in the main; That therefore 'twas but just that e'ery Clan Should join and stand together as one Man. This Doctrine with the Herd prevail'd apace, And made them Rebels who profess'd most Grace, Each in proportion to their Holy Zeal, Tho' they meant well, resolv'd on doing ill. The Lords and Gentry now, who had before Refus'd Obedience to the Legal Pow'r, And dreaded the Surrender more than all That could their further Insolence befall, Laid hold of this Occasion to encrease The Peoples growing Fears and Jealousies; Adding, that Scotland would be now estrang'd From her old Laws, and to a Province chang'd, And in a little time must govern'd be, Like Ireland, by some English Deputy. This also was confirm'd by some that were Lords (at that juncture) of the Council there, Who us'd to rule and triumph o'er the Land, At pleasure, uncontroul'd and unrestrain'd, And therefore were disgusted that they'd lost Much of that Power which they once could boast, The King appointing for the Land's Relief, A President that might direct in Chief, And in the Council so controul the rest, That the poor Subject might not be oppress'd. Thus we may see how treach'rous and unjust The Great will prove on e'ery small disgust; So that unhappy Princes have no way, But still with Gifts to bribe 'em to obey. The End of the Ninth Year. THE Earl of Bedford's CHARACTER. Large his Estate, a Man reputed Wise, Forward to Act, and able to Advise, A great Contriver in the House of Peers, Who mov'd in the first Rank of Managers. Tho' most believ'd his Fortune was too great To aim at the Subversion of the State, And that he meant the Throne no other hurt Than to advance his Family at Court, And not at all to weaken or aggrieve The King, by less'ning the Prerogative; For knowing how the Royal Conscience stood Affected in the Case of Strafford's Blood, To serve His Majesty in that Affair, He undertook with Secresy the Care Of skreening the unhappy Peer from those Who sought his Life to blast the King's repose; Also t'obtain an Act that should secure As large an Income to the Sov'reign Pow'r, For its support and safety, as had been Enjoy'd in any Predecessor's Reign: For which good Service no obsequious Peer Had firmer Thoughts, or could be more sincere, As some believe, who do affirm he meant To use his Int'rest in the Parliament For settling the Revenue of Excise Upon the Crown, when straiten'd for Supplies; But of a sudden fell extreamly ill, Whilst that severe unprecedented Bill, That made so wise a Head the Peoples Prey, Beneath the Lords Consideration lay; Which Sickness forc'd him not alone to wave His good Designs, but sent him to the Grave. Who, to his Friends, did on his Death-bed own, He fear'd the Senate's rashness with the Throne, Would, in the end, produce much worse Events, Than had the long disuse of Parliaments. Whence 'tis conjectur'd he'd have stop'd the force Of Faction and have steer'd a mod'rate Course, Had he surviv'd his Bane: But some that knew His Wisdom and his Inclinations too, Thought him scarce fortify'd enough to bear The shock of such a Tempest as was near; And that he therefore di'd in time, to save His Honour, by retiring to the Grave. But to all humane Wisdom 'tis unknown, What he that's dead, if living, might have done: Ill-natur'd Guesses give the World distaste, 'Tis therefore Manners to suppose the best. THE Lord Viscount Say's CHARACTER. By Nature much reserv'd, but carr'd within His Breast a learn'd and pow'rful Magazine His Fortune narrow, but his Parts compleat, His Soul aspiring, his Ambition great; The Mouth and Leader of the rigid'st sort Of Puritans, that teas'd both King and Court: Nor would his Pride rest satisfy'd alone With reas'nable Preferments from the Throne, Without reforming to his restless Mind The Church, to which his Heart was disinclin'd, Oft holding Contests with the Priests thereof, To make her Doctrines the Dissenters scoff. Nor was he to the Throne's Monarchick State More duteous or an Enemy less great, Opposing all those Levies that were made Without the Senate, for the Sov'reign's Aid, When 'twas the Pride of Faction to postpone The Crown's Affairs to expedite their own: At York he rather chose to be confin'd, Than to subscribe what other Peers had sign'd A Protestation against holding Correspondence with the Scots.; By which, and for refusing to comply With Ship-Money, he rais'd himself so high In the esteem of all the Factious Clan, That they ador'd him as if more than Man, Made him their Moses to defend the Gap, And guard their Party against all mishap; None having more Authority than he, With all the spightful Sons of Purity; Had also good repute with some that meant No Inj'ry to the King or Government, Who took him for a wise judicious Man, Unprejudic'd to Church or Sovereign, And only struggl'd for the glorious Cause Of Liberty, Religion, and the Laws, Tho' none, in truth, could prove to all the Three, A more destructive Enemy than he. But 'tis the craft of Faction to pretend Their only Aim is to repair and mend, When Wisemen, by their Workings, see their vile Endeavours tend to populate and spoil. THE Lord Mandevile's CHARACTER. Esteem'd by all Men to a high degree, For Parts, good Breeding, and Civility, The eldest Son of Manchester the Wise Lord Privy-Seal., Who from no Title did to Earldom rise: Early at Court the junior Lord became A Fav'rite of the Duke of Buckingham, Out of whose Family he chose a Bride, And was, by Marriage, to His Grace ally'd; Prefer'd by him, in Royal James's Reign, T'attend the Prince in his Amours in Spain; Was also summon'd, in his greener Years, In's Father's Life-time, to the House of Peers, By Name of Lord Kimbolton, such a Grace As few could boast of in those captious Days. His Lady dying, and the Duke, his Friend, Receiving also his unhappy End, The Lord (enamour'd with her youthful Charms) Chose Earl of Warwick's Daughter to his Nuptial Arms, Her Father having little grace at Court, Because he cherish'd, to the Kingdom's hurt, All such as proudly labour'd to advance The Int'rest of the stiff-neck'd Puritans, Whose study'd Scruples were design'd alone, To craftily o'erturn the Church and Throne. Upon this Marriage Mandevile withdrew From Court, and now did Warwick's Steps pursue, Seem'd to dislike the Measures of the State, And with the Faction grew extreamly great, Wholly conversing with no Friends but those Who were the Church and Crown's notorious Foes; Caballing with some Persons who had clos'd Together, and a Brotherhood compos'd, Oblig'd beneath one Roof to Bed and Board, Near to the Rural Mansion of my Lord, That they the better might their Schemes project, And study Ways to bring them to effect. To this Cabal of Enemies to Court, A number of that Classis had resort, And being to no good alike inclin'd, In mutual Love and factious Friendship join'd. This caus'd the Lord to flourish at a rate, Beyond the Income of his small Estate, Contracting such a Debt, that heavy lay, Long after, as a Summ too large to pay; Aiming, by's Hospitality, to gain That popular Esteem the Wise disdain, Which he accomplish'd, insomuch that none Could into greater Confidence be grown, Than he, with all the discontented Crew, Who teas'd the Power they wanted to subdue. No Person more intrusted with the deep Designs that did in Factious Bosoms sleep. None better knew the Game they meant to play, And what in Chaos undigested lay; Yet whatsoe'er his Purposes might be, His smooth engaging Affability, And gentle Temper, were a perfect Skreen To all Enormities that lurk'd within; For no Man with an humbler Mien could hide The vile Suggestions of aspiring Pride. But notwithstanding all his outward shews Of Innocence, the Court thought fit t'accuse His Lordship of High-Treason, by which course, 'Tis said, the Throne inflam'd and made him worse. But wretched sure and dang'rous is the state Of him that Justice makes more desperate. Nor does the Sov'reign Pow'r deserve our Blame, For crushing those who undermine the same. No sooner had the Factious Tribe begun Those open Mischiefs that o'erturn'd the Throne, But o'er the Rebels Manchester His Father then dead. obtain'd, From the proud Rump, a General Command, And with an able Host of Foot and Horse, Had Orders to unite the Scottish Force: But not long after, by his Factious Friends, B'ing thought too mild to serve their wicked Ends, Was from his Post remov'd, as most agree, For want of Malice and Barbarity Sufficient to accomplish or advance The Pious Work of the Reforming Saints. Which diffidence secur'd him from the Guilt Of Royal Blood, by daring Rebels spilt; And in some measure kept his Honour free From joining in that sad Catastrophe. So that when Heav'n vouchsaf'd once more to bless The wretched Land with Monarchy and Peace, Forgiving Charles to Favour soon restor'd The once mistaken but repenting Lord, Who ever after, that he might attone For the past Ills he had so rashly done, Continu'd True and Faithful to the Throne. Thus Mercy to a gen'rous Breast apply'd, Reforms the Mind, and humbles Factious Pride; When Punishment, tho' just, provokes the Brave To carry restless Vengeance to the Grave. A.D. 1634. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Tenth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First. Anno Dom. 1634. There having happen'd mischievous and great Disorders in the Shire of Somerset, Such as were dang'rous to the Publick Peace, And gave much trouble to the Justices; They therefore mov'd the Judges Lord Chief Justice Richardson and Judge Denham. at their Lent Assize, that for the future they'd prevent The like, which could be done no other way But by suppressing on the Sabbath-Day, Church-Ales and Wakes, which often were the cause Of Man's transgressing God's and humane Laws. The Judges with the Justices comply'd, And did an Order speedily provide, That all such Revels should be laid aside, Pursuant to a former Order sign'd By the Lord Popham Lord Chief Justice., when Eliza reign'd, Directing to the Constables the same, Requiring all and every of them To give to their Parochial Minister A Copy to be read thrice every Year On the first Sunday in February, and the two Sundays before Easter. In their respective Churches, to suppress All Sports and Revels upon the Sabbath-days. But this was by the Bishops thought to be A trespass upon their Authority, And gave them such offence, that they procur'd His Majesty's Commission, which impower'd The Lord Bishop. of Bath, and some Divines within His See where these Miscarriages had been, T'examine all the Judges had advis'd And done of late in the Affair premis'd. But notwithstanding that the Bishops made This stir, the Judges Order was obey'd: And in the Long-Vacation, when the same Chief Justice to the next Assizes came, Against all Sabbath-Revels he at large Renew'd upon the Bench his former Charge, Making some Persons feel the weight of Pow'r, Who'd broke the Order he had made before. But when the Lord Chief Justice came to Town, The Lambeth-Primate hearing what he'd done, Sent for His Lordship, told him, 'twas the Will And Pleasure of the King he should repeal His Order, the neglect of which should be, At peril, answer'd to Authority. The Lord Chief Justice knowing he should lose His Honourable Post, should he refuse To acquiesce, chose rather to comply, Than rashly tumble from a Seat so high; Accordingly, to th'Country's great surprize, Revok'd his Order at the next Assize. But this Affair, that did so odd appear, By this new-turn, had not its Period here, For those, who for the Order had apply'd, B'ing now provok'd to see it thus destroy'd, Made humble Supplication to the Throne, To have these Sabbath-Ales and Wakes put down. This earnest Suit of theirs gave great Offence, And, by the King, was constru'd Insolence; Who, foreign from their hopes, did thereupon Revive his Father's Declaration Published by King James in the 16th Year of his Reign., Which did not disallow or take away Lawful Recr'ations on the Sabbath-day, But with Restrictions, to prevent Abuse Of harmless Pastimes, countenanc'd their use, To free his Subjects from those servile Yokes Which some Divines impos'd upon their Flocks, That they might ride the People, spur their Sides, And make 'em hum-drum Vassals to their Guides. For 'tis too oft the Pride of him that rules A Congregation for the good of Souls, T'enslave the Body, also, if he can, And triumph o'er the grosser part of Man. But as this Declaration, once before, Had been but ill receiv'd from Sov'reign Pow'r, So now its Publication gave offence To most, especially the sober Saints, Whose Holy Pride with greatest lustre shines When to a mod'rate Course the Church inclines. So when the Stars are in a hazy Night, By misty Vapours hid from humane sight, The creeping Glow-worm then best shews his Light. Last Year the London Merchants having made Complaint of great Miscarriages in Trade, Importing they'd unfortunately lost, By Turks, and other Pirates on the Coast, Sev'ral rich Ships, for want of Marine Pow'r, To make the British Ocean more secure, O'er which the English Navy us'd to bear The sway, and proudly triumph without fear, These Murmurs mov'd His Majesty to be Desirous of a speedy Force by Sea, Sufficient to recover what the Crown, In former Reigns, had boasted as its own, Which had not only been usurp'd of late, By th'Dutch, who were in Shipping much more great, But in a Tract Intitled Mare Liberum. disputed, which was penn'd By the Learn'd Hugo Grotius, who maintain'd, No Kingdom had Dominion o'er the Sea, But that it was to every Nation free. Mov'd by these Insults, the abuse of Trade, And the Complaints by suff'ring Merchants made, The King consulted how he might with speed Improve his Fleet, at such a time of need, When common Safety could not be delay'd, Till a new Parliament should grant an Aid, Noy, the Attorney-General, whose Name Was much superior to all others Fame, For profound Learning in the Laws, assur'd The King that he was legally impower'd, To levy Money for the Land's defence, In any such like dang'rous Exigence; For that no Reason could injoin the Prince, To Govern and Protect without the Means, Noy bringing sev'ral Precedents whereby He prov'd the King had sole Authority, To levy such a Naval Aid upon His Subjects Lands as should suffice the Throne, When for his Peoples Safety or his own. The Royal Ear much pleas'd with this Advice, Given by Noy, a Man esteem'd so wise, The needy King thus influenc'd by him, Sent Writs to all his Counties Maritime, Requiring them, without delay, to fit, Equip, and Victual such a certain Fleet, That might the British Coast from Pirates free, Defend the Kingdom and her Rights by Sea; Accordingly, by this unhappy course, The King had soon improv'd his Naval Force Into a pow'rful Fleet, tho' yet too few In number to obtain the End in view; Therefore the Writs, it was resolv'd at Helm, Should go through all the Counties in the Realm. But that belonging to another Year, Shall more at large, in proper place, appear. The Swedish Army having lost the Great Gustavus, now became unfortunate, Were by the brave Hungarian's forc'd to fly Out of Bohemia into Saxony, The Swedes in fight sustaining so severe An Overthrow, near fatal Norlinger By some writ Nordlinguen, but by Sir R. Baker, Norlinger., That a surrender of that Town ensu'd, Without fatigue or loss of German Blood; O'er Wittemburg with small repulse they run, And drove the Duke thereof to Strasburg Town. Thus did at once successfully impede The growing Greatness of the Warlike Swede. This turn produc'd a Peace between the Foes, Altho' it yielded but a small repose, For they, e'relong, renew'd their former Jars, And soon relaps'd into ambitious Wars. An artful Stratagem by which the Brave Oppress the Weak, and giving Crouds enslave, And by the Numbers in their Quarrels slain, Refresh their Glories and support their Reign. Wentworth in Ireland, with an careful Hand, Was settling now the Quiet of that Land, Which by the Romans, who were grown too great, Had been disturb'd, and much impair'd of late; The Papists having there, for sev'ral Years, Encreas'd for want of able Ministers, Sufficient to encourage and advance The Faith and Int'rest of the Protestants. The Livings of the Church in general, At that time, being so extreamly small, That few, of Learning, thought it worth their while To labour in so poor and starving Soil. The Deputy conceiving this to be The reason of the growth of Popery, By th'Mediation of Archbishop Laud, Prevail'd upon the King to do so good And laudable a Work as to restore All the Impropriations in his Pow'r, Which from the Popish Church had by the Crown Been wrested in the Reformation; That Augmentations might be made to all Those Livings that were scandalously small, And not sufficient to support a Priest, Free from great Hardships and Contempt at least, With this the King was forward to comply, Tho' his Revenue was impair'd thereby, Always preferring, whilst he rul'd the Throne, God and His Church's Glory to his own. Now all the Inns of Court, in mighty State, Did on the Royal Pair together wait, At Candlemas, in order to present A Mask or Mumm'ry to the Government, Making a gay Procession thro' the Strand, In Chariots that did e'ery Eye command, So richly gilt and furnish'd for the Night, That joyful Crouds extol'd the noble Sight; And as they gaz'd and jostl'd to and fro, Grac'd with their loud Huzza's the gaudy Show. So Kings, by pompous Trains, and such like Arts, Delight the Peoples Eyes and win their Hearts. The Earl of Portland, to the Grave, this Year, Fell from the Seat of Lord High-Treasurer, And left the Court, who for such Wind-falls wait, To struggle for that gainful Post of State. Thus he that highest climbs above the Ground, Must fall at once without the least rebound. Who then would sacrifice the Peace of Life, To humane Greatness, full of Care and Strife, Since all Men know, they in a little while Must quit those Honours gain'd with so much Toil. The End of the Tenth Year. THE CHARACTER OF Mr. John Pym. A crafty Spokesman, happy in a Tongue With flowing Words and apt Expressions hung, Bred in his Youth, as Hist'ry does report, An able Clerk in the Exchequer-Court. His Parts being chiefly the effect of great Industry, and had cost much Time and Sweat; Which he improv'd by Practise, and acquir'd A knack of speaking well, to be admir'd, Always espousing the Contentious Side, To gratify his Int'rest or his Pride; Till for his Speeches he at length became, Among the Factious Tribe, a Man of Fame: Was, by the murm'ring puritannick Saints, Cry'd up for Gravity and Eloquence, And all things else that in the Commons-House Could rend'r him fit for their Rebellious use. These publick Flatt'ries made him strive the more To please the Side that rais'd his Character. Tho' some believe he meant not to proceed, At first, so far as by degrees he did: But Courtship and Applause still drew him on, To be the Mouth of those that sack'd the Throne, That in the worst Designs he most appear'd, And in the vilest Feuds was loudest heard. His great Concernment for Religion gain'd A vogue, which he industriously maintain'd, By often making Speeches to surprise The Nation with new Fears and Jealousies, Feign'd by himself, then open'd to impede Supplies, at all times when the Crown had need. Strafford with fiery Vengeance he pursu'd, As if he thirsted for his guiltless Blood; And in that fatal Bus'ness was the Man Who in the furious Senate led the Van, Bribing an Irish Evidence with Coin, And chang'd his tatter'd Frize to costly fine Apparel, that the Scoundrel might appear Like one who scorn'd to Lye or to Forswear: And by such Managements as these betray'd The injur'd Earl to sacrifice his Head. Yet, after all his Zeal, would have withdrawn From hot-brain'd Faction to have serv'd the Throne, Had the Crown condescended to prefer A Foe to be Exchequer-Chancellor, A Post the King had promis'd him, but fear'd To trust him, for new Reasons that appear'd. But when the Faction found their Tool inclin'd To serve the Sov'reign Pow'r and change his Mind, They soon began to lessen their Esteem, And as he fell from them they slighted him. Who now despairing of the Post in view, And of his Patron's The Earl of Bedford, who was to be made Lord-Treasurer. high Preferment too, Relaps'd into his old pernicious course, And with impatience fell from bad to worse, That none could have a more industrious hand Than he, i'th' Miseries of his native Land; Still rushing on till Heaven stop'd his speed, And with a loathsome Evil Morbus Pediculosus: struck him dead, That e're he perish'd, as he lay and mourn'd His Sins, his Flesh was into Vermin turn'd, That his best Friends could neither bear the smell Or sight of such an odious Spectacle. Therefore if Men who ruffle humane peace, Would call to mind such Instances as these, They'd stop their wicked course, no further run, But tremble and repent the Ills they've done. THE CHARACTER OF Mr. John Hambden. Of good Extraction, happy in Estate, Gifted by Nature, his Acquirements great; When young and gay no Appetite he starv'd, But of a sudden chang'd and grew reserv'd; And from a Life of Pleasure did, at once, Reform, and all its Vanities renounce, Retaining still that chearfulness of Mind And Look, to which he'd always been inclin'd: In Conversation was both wise and free, And full of courteous Affability: By which engaging means he gain'd the good Opinion of his Country Neighbourhood; And in the Shire of Bucks, wherein he liv'd, To a high pitch of Fame at length arriv'd, Extending the Repute he thus had gain'd, To all the Corners of his native Land, By standing up so warmly to oppose That Tax Ship-Money. which rais'd the Crown such spightful Foes, And unassisted, at his own Expence, Defending a long Suit against his Prince. This made him noted, popular and great, Among the Faction that unhing'd the State, Who, as their darling Fav'rite and the Prop Of publick Liberty, now cry'd him up. These Flatt'ries still engag'd him more and more, To ruffle and disgust the Sov'reign Pow'r, And to assist the Faction in the House, In all things where his Tongue might be of use, Speaking with so much Gravity and Art, And with a Mien so modest plaid his Part, That his fair Words would often win applause From Persons who abhor'd the Factious Cause; With so much craft an Argument would state, And back his Point with Reasons of such weight, Proceeding with such Temper, always free From Warmth, Aspersion, or Indecency, That 'twas his frequent Luck to gain some great Advantage in the House by each Debate, Yet always spoke as if he'd no regard To Cause or Party, but by Reason steer'd. No Man, both Friends and Enemies agree, Had greater Power o'er himself than he; For none could put on an external Mien, More diff'rent from the Man that lurk'd within, Which did too plainly to the World appear, When he despis'd the Mask he us'd to wear; Than none with Malice and Revenge inflam'd, Could for more rash or wicked Deeds be blam'd, And was as proud to act a Rebel's Part, As if the Lust of Pow'r, tho' skreen'd by Art, Had long been grafted in his impious Heart; For first, much Pains and Eloquence he spent, To weaken and unhinge the Government, Warming the House with Speeches, to prepare And ripen Faction for domestick War; Which when advanc'd, the Spokesman soon became A bold rebellious Col'nel in the same, And then, that Moderation he before Dissembl'd, vanish'd, and appear'd no more. So he that seeks advantage of the Fair, With humble Looks and Speeches baits his Snare; But when the Dame is by his Arts betray'd, He scorns the Beauty he before obey'd. When thus the Faction into Flames had blown The Fire which long had smother'd round the Throne, None could be more industrious to provide New Wedges to extend the Breach more wide, Than Hambden; none more subtil of Device, To circumvent all Overtures of Peace; None more industrious to prolong the Curse Of War, and make the bad Distemper worse, Till in a Battel he was fond to fight, Spur'd on by Fate, or hurry'd on by Spight, In Chalgrave-Field Near Thame. he perish'd by a Brace Of flying Balls that gave the Rebel chase, And in his Shoulders found a resting-place. Thus he who with such artful Pains and Care, Push'd on the Faction and advanc'd the War, Became an early Victim to the Sword He'd rais'd, to give his Crimes a just Reward. THE CHARACTER OF Mr. St. John. Bred to contentious Law in Lincoln's-Inn, Where he for Years a Barrister had been, Was known to be industrious and allow'd A Man of Parts, but too reserv'd and proud, Had little Bus'ness in the Hall, or none, Till Hambden's Case of Ship-Money came on, Wherein he rais'd his Reputation high, With all that look'd upon that Tax awry; And by his Pleadings gain'd such great Applause, Thro' the whole Town, that there was scarce a Cause In any Court, contested with the Crown, But he was Fee'd as Champion of the Gown; For he that once tugs well against the Tide, Shall ne'er want Bus'ness from the Factious Side. Some time before his Rise, when in the Hall, His Credit, as a Lawyer, was but small, He had been handl'd, ruffl'd, and expos'd, For some Seditious Paper he'd disclos'd, Tho' such a Trifle that at length they stop'd Proceedings, and the Prosecution drop'd: However, thinking this attack had hurt His Fame, he grew incens'd against the Court, And from that time contracted a disgust, That made him think Revenge no less than just. This spurr'd him forward to a vile Extream, And join'd him close with Hambden and with Pym, Who, with three Lords, were thought the chief Cabal, That fram'd the Engine and projected all Those fatal Schemes by which the Faction mov'd, And their unjust Advantages improv'd, Till they had gain'd sufficient Pow'r to rend In Shreds and Tatters what they could not mend. Nor did the angry Lawyer less abhor The Church establish'd, than the Sov'reign Pow'r, Which groundless Prejudice at first arose From the ill converse of the Friends he chose; But being Son to Bullingbrook the Earl, Who out of Wedlock got the haughty Churl, And being therefore, by his Father's side, To th'Earl of Bedford spuriously ally'd, Did, by his Patronage and Friendship, tow'r To be the General Solicitor. During which Office he the Bill maintain'd 'Gainst Strafford, when by Parliament arraign'd, Whose Honour he presum'd to basely wrong, In Words too barb'rous for a Christian Tongue; Both drew and back'd, like a substantial Whig, The factious Bill prefer'd by Sir Arthur Haslerig, To settle the Militia, that the Crown Might lose the only Safeguard of the Throne, St. John declaring, that the King had no Such Pow'r by Law, as any Right thereto, A hopeful trusty Agent thus to swerve From that good Sov'reign he was sworn to serve; But all the Actions of his Life were such, That his best Deeds still merited Reproach: For after this, when pressing Wants drew near, His Friends in Bedford and in Hertford-shire, To serve their darling Orator, were Bound For Fifty or for Threescore Thousand Pound, Who after, to the shame of Faction, fled To France, and left the mighty Debt unpaid, To th'ruin of his Sureties here at Home, Who Sold and Mortgag'd to discharge the Summ. Yet when he'd plaid these Pranks, the gracious Throne Was, by his Friends at Court prevail'd upon, To call him home, create the 'Squire a Peer, Whereby he might enjoy his Freedom here, Engaging he should evermore defend The Sov'reign Pow'r, and prove a Loyal Friend, And that some proper Measures should be us'd To satisfy those Persons he'd abus'd. Upon these Terms His Majesty comply'd, And on his Friends Assurances rely'd: But Royal Goodness had no sooner warm'd The frozen Snake, with pointed Malice arm'd, And thus, depending on deceitful Words, Advanc'd the Serpent to the House of Lords, E're he oppos'd the Int'rest of the Crown; Nor was he from that Moment ever known, To do one faithful Service to the Throne, But like a thankless Monster, when the Rage Of Faction punish'd that prepost'rous Age, Was of that number who at first comply'd, To take Commissions on the Rebels side; St. John commanding (till he'd run his Course, Which prov'd but short) a Regiment of Horse, Tho' conscious of the Cause for which he stood, He turn'd rank Coward in the Field of Blood, And at Edghill, as flying from the Fight, Receiv'd a Shot, but was not kill'd outright, Living in Pain, till the succeeding Day Parted his Soul from her misguided Clay, Dying a Pris'ner to that injur'd Pow'r He had so oft traduc'd and wrong'd before; Yet on his Death-bed, in their Factious Cant, Declar'd, he to the King no Mischief meant, Tho' in the Rebel Cause his Blood he spilt, And was by Vengeance punish'd in his Guilt. But sure Rebellion is a Crime too great And black to be repented of so late, For Rebels, lest of Heaven's Grace debarr'd, Could never live so ill and die so hard. Mr. Nathaniel Fiennes's CHARACTER. At Oxford bred, that learn'd prolifick Field, Which, with its Fruits, such Thorns and Briars yield, Nurs'd at New-College, by descent a Kin To him who had the sacred Founder William of Wickam. been, Whereby he some Advantages enjoy'd, Which were to others of the House deny'd, From thence remov'd into that hopeful Soil, Geneva, where they take such care to spoil Our English Youth, transplanted only there, To suck in factious and contentious Air. From thence his Inclinations he pursu'd To Switzerland, those blessed Cantons view'd. And that he might improve the sprouting Seeds He'd gather'd, into vile substantial Weeds, And still contract a Prejudice more great, Against the Church and the Monarchick State, Thro' Scotland he return'd, that Place of Worth, Just when Rebellion there was budding forth, As if he wanted to observe the Mode Of practising those Rules he'd learn'd abroad. Soon after this the wand'ring finish'd Saint Was found among the Tribe in Parliament, Most firmly link'd with that profound Cabal, Who plotted, manag'd, and projected all Those fatal Mischiefs which, from time to time, Were push'd with Fury on, from Crime to Crime, And for the Cause was so intirely stanch, To cry with Vane and Hambden, Root and Branch, Whose Mercy shews us evidently plain, The Principles of those that led the Van. No sooner had they nurs'd their factious Jars, Into their hop'd for Blessing Civil Wars, But Fiennes, without the least Reluctance, plaid The Part to which he'd from a Boy been bred, And with as promising a Grace rebell'd, As any thirsty Traytor in the Field, Kept Bristol for the Parliament, but soon, For want of Aid, surrender'd to the Crown; Which disadvantage gave much Discontent, Both to the Army and the Parliament; Some making his Mismanagement appear The effect of downright Cowardice and Fear; So that altho' no Mortal could have more Aversion to the Church and Sov'reign Pow'r, And tho' his Father's Int'rest and his own Were great, for the good Service they had done, Yet their Court-Martial try'd him, and decreed, Their faithful Servant should resign his Head, Which he had lost, but Essex Then the Parliament's General. interven'd, And from the fatal Blow his Noddle skreen'd; But the disgrace of Cowardice remain'd, And his rebellious Honour still was stain'd, That he declin'd the War he help'd to make, And did with Shame his Native Land forsake, Grew angry at the loss of their Applause, And left their Service, tho' he lov'd their Cause. For Rebels, like to Harlots, once drawn in, Retain the Itch that prompts them to the Sin. A.D. 1635. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Eleventh Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1635. The Sums for Shipping, which the King's demand, By Writ, had brought into his Royal Hand, Had been apply'd so justly to appease The People's Murmurs, that the British Seas Were now adorn'd and guarded by a Fleet, Well Victual'd, Mann'd, and formidably Great, O'er which the Earl of Lindsey had a Call To the high Station of Chief Admiral; And next to him His Majesty made choice Of th'Earl of Essex, to Command as Vice, Who now took care to make the Coast secure, Where Pirates had annoy'd our Trade before: Nor did they only keep our Channels free From such a base unlawful Enemy, But sav'd all Flanders from the French and Dutch, Who jointly were endeav'ring to encroach Upon the Spaniard, and in order to Obtain the pleasing End they had in view, They block'd up Dunkirk both by Land and Sea, That there no Succours should imported be, Whilst the French Troops went forward with the Scene, And forc'd the Country to submit within, But Lindsey timely with the English Fleet, Dislodg'd the Dutch, and caus'd them to retreat, At once quite disappointing what the join'd Confed'rates had so plausibly design'd, Not doubting but they should the whole subdue, And share the fruitful Soil between the two; But Providence thought fit to interpose, And break the Scheme of the united Foes. To Court the Earl of Arundel this Year, From Shropshire brought that Prodigy old Thomas. Parr, Who to a hundred fifty odd arriv'd, And to an Age more wondrous might have liv'd, Had not the change of Diet and of Air, And the fatigue of travelling so far, Shorten'd his Days, he seeming to have strength Enough to've spun 'em to a greater length, But courtly Dainties and unhealthful Ease Perform'd the Office of Infirmities, And took the rev'rend Grandsire off the Stage, Who liv'd and dy'd the Wonder of the Age. Charles, Prince Elector Palatine came o'er This Year to England, from the German Shore, To pay the King a Visit, and to treat About recov'ring the Palatinate. Soon after him his Brothers Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice. also came, Whose Valour here immortaliz'd their Name. The Dutch observing that the English Throne Was now at Sea so formidable grown, Thought it their safest Conduct to secure The Friendship of a Prince so great in Pow'r, Accordingly those Provinces sent o'er, In mighty Splendor, their Embassador, In order to congratulate the Birth O'th' Princess Princess Elizabeth., by the Royal Womb brought forth; And to ingratiate with the King the more, Rich Presents sent from the Batavian Shore, Consisting of two spacious China Jars, A Clock that shew'd the Course of Moon and Stars, By that Imperial Artist, as 'tis said, The famous Emperor Rudulphus made; Also some noble Paintings of the great Immortal Titian and of Tintaret: All which were welcome to the Royal Hand, And he that brought 'em richly entertain'd. The careful King, who now began to see Some inconvenience in his Treasury, Arising chiefly from Disputes and Jars Among the several Commissioners, Made choice of Juxon Then Bishop of London., singly to sustain, What other Fav'rites hop'd for, but in vain; Concluding, that a Man so Wise and Just, Would faithfully discharge so high a Trust Nor could the prudent King, in all his Realm, Have found a fitter Man to steer the Helm, Who wanted no Endowments to compleat A wise and pious Minister of State, Tho' envy'd by the Court, who'd all an Eye Upon a Sphere so thriving and so high, Thinking themselves much wrong'd, that such a Post Should by the rev'rend Churchmen be ingrost, A Province, which the Temp'ral Lords believ'd Their own, till by this sudden Change deceiv'd, Wherein 't'had been their Custom to postpone The King and Kingdom's Int'rest to their own, And to advance their Families to great And opulent Employments in the State; Therefore His Majesty thought fit to chuse A Man who'd no such Motives to abuse His Trust, or to induce him to provide, By means unjust, for others near ally'd; For Juxon had no Family to raise, Or make a Purse for, by clandestine ways; No Wife to tempt or Children to entice His Soul to Brib'ry, Fraud, or Avarice. Nor did he fail his Master's Hopes, but prov'd The best that in that Station ever mov'd; And by his faithful Service to the Crown, Intail'd immortal Honour on the Gown. But should the Clergy on the publick Stage Be thus advanc'd, in this licentious Age, Aspiring Knaves would with the Fools agree, To cry the Practise down for Popery; And Atheists join with the unchristian Deists, To tell the People they were rid by Priests. But better so than to be bought and sold By those who make the most of what they hold. The End of the Eleventh Year. THE CHARACTER OF Archbishop Laud. When Buckingham, the Gen'rous and the Great, Stood high above all others in the State, Upon the Rev'rend Laud he cast an Eye Of Favour, for his Parts and Probity, Made him his Confident, became his Friend, And did the faithful Shepherd recommend To his Great Master, as a worthy Guide, Whose Actions, with the Truths he taught comply'd, One who the Church's Int'rest understood, And was not only learn'd, but wise and good. The Doctor soon was by the King approv'd, Caress'd, much favour'd, trusted and belov'd, And from St. David's cold and barren See, (Accepted but by few so fam'd as he) The only poor Preferment that he got, Whilst James the First in Peace and Glory sat, Was by the Royal Son translated soon To Bath and Wells, a more prolifick Boon; And from that time, 'twixt Majesty and Grace, His Pow'r in Church-Affairs encreas'd apace, So far that no Man of the Robe could rise Without his Approbation and Advice; Having thro' all his Life oppos'd with great Disgust, the Enemies of Church and State, And was the only Moses that withstood The growing Pride of the Calvinian Brood, Who'd long before traduc'd him with the Name Of Papist, tho' he ne'er deserv'd the same, For none in Pulpit or with Pen could be A greater Bulwark against Rome than he. But Papist, is the Venom which the Mouth Of Faction spits at all who stop their growth. Half their Religion is to pelt their Dirt At pious Men, who labour to support The Church and Throne, which they alike defame, And at their utter ruin slyly aim. His next Translation was to London See, Where he maintain'd his old Integrity, And exercis'd his Jurisdiction there, O'er Calvin's Faction with unspotted Care, Whilst the Archbishop slack'd the Reins of Pow'r, And by his Favour made the Saints secure, That Abbot's Smiles still cherish'd and improv'd More Mischiefs, than the Frowns of Laud remov'd. At length the Primate at his Palace dy'd, And Bishop Laud the vacant See supply'd, Retaining still his great dislike to those He rightly judg'd to be the Kingdom's Foes, Forgetting not how roughly he'd been us'd, And by those Saints detracted and abus'd, Which some suppose inflam'd his holy Zeal, And made him with that Tribe too hardly deal. But since it was his Duty to defend The Faith, which had advanc'd him to that end, How could his just Endeavours be too great To crush the Enemies of Church and State; For if the Work he undertook was good, It ne'er could be too zealously pursu'd. Laud thus invested with the highest Pow'r, To which the best of Subjects here could tow'r, Beheld the Church, Christ's Garden, over-run With dang'rous Weeds, to her destruction prone, And therefore, Gard'ner-like, began in hast To Hoe the Hemlock up that thriv'd so fast: For Years he labour'd with a faithful hand, Did sultry Heats and bitter Storms withstand, By Arts unguarded, having no defence But Justice, Piety and Innocence; Courted no Friends t'assist him in his Task, And would no shelter but of Heaven ask; Thus being well convinc'd the Work was just, In God and his own Conscience put his Trust, Relying not for safety on the Pow'r Of Man, but thought himself without secure. In the Lord's House he decently inclos'd The Holy Table, which had stood expos'd Till then, i'th' centre of the middle Ile, For Men to loll upon and Dogs defile. This was an Innovation deem'd by those Who were the Church's and the Bishop's Foes, Tho' by the best and wisest sort approv'd, Who Decency esteem'd and Order lov'd; Yet many Pastors wanting Will or Wit To reconcile their Flocks to what was meet, The Alteration being some Expence, The Cost, as well as Edict, gave Offence, That sundry Parishes refus'd to yield Obedience, till by force of Law compel'd; Which rigid Measures daily did encrease The number of the Primate's Enemies, Who by their Clamours caus'd him to appear Imperious, haughty, peevish and severe, When he meant well what they misconstru'd ill, And blam'd as Pride, tho' but impatient Zeal. The next mishap that render'd him at Court Envy'd by those that did him greatest hurt, Was, on the Death of Lord High Treasurer Earl of Portland., His being made the Chief Commissioner, When many craving Courtiers had an Eye Upon that gainful Orb the Treasury. Envying the Primate, who was now so great, Not only in the Church, but in the State; Thwarted his Temper, all his Measures cross'd, And made him soon so weary of his Post, That 'twas his earnest Care to recommend Juxon his Creature and his Bosom Friend, To the high Station of Lord Treasurer, Having, at the Request, and by the Pow'r Of Laud been rais'd to London See before. This oversight inflam'd the Primate's Foes, Who now resolv'd to ruffle his repose, And to neglect no Measures that might show Their readiness to work his Overthrow; But the good Man despising Earthly Power, In a sound Conscience thought himself secure; Which over-pious Temper, by degrees, Gave great Advantage to his Enemies, Who when the Faction had advanc'd their Cause, And gain'd sure Int'rest in the Lords and Laws, Fond to subdue a Foe whose pious Care Had, to their progress, been so great a Bar, They form'd a Scheme to gratify their Hate, With such a Life they ne'er could imitate, Clamour'd aloud against his Book of Sports, Turn'd all his good Designs to publick Hurts, And for his noted Vertues, not his Crimes, Made him the second Martyr of those Times, After he'd been confin'd four Years, or more, A pensive Pris'ner in the fatal Tow'r, Till he by Pray'r and Fasting had refin'd His Earthly Body to a Heav'nly Mind; Who, tho' revil'd as passing to the Block, By impious Ruffians planted there to Mock The dying Saint, yet with a Christian Grace He bore his Suff'rings, never chang'd his Face, But like His great Example pass'd away, Thro' Death and Darkness to eternal Day. So with their Blood the bless'd Apostles seal'd Those Holy Truths they for our good reveal'd, That Christians, rather than deny their Faith, Might chearfully, like them, resign their Breath. THE CHARACTER OF Bishop Juxon. The best good Man that ever sate so high, Who never spoke amiss or step'd awry, So far as to incur the Peoples Blame, Or bring the least Dishonour on his Name, Tho' in an envious Juncture he was Great, Not only in the Church but in the State; In both discharging with unspotted Care, The Trust of Bishop and of Treasurer, When few, tho' ne'er so innocent of Crimes, Escap'd the rancour of those spightful Times, And when to stand so eminently high Was thought sufficient ground for Calumny, And the kind Smiles and Favours of the Throne, Enough to make Men ev'ly look'd upon, Yet did the Rev'rend Prelate steer his Course So wisely, when no Age could well be worse, That unmolested he enjoy'd his Peace, Secure from the attacks of Enemies; By all Sides much respected and approv'd, Honour'd by ill Men, by the good belov'd, Yet was he known to be the chosen Friend Of injur'd Laud, who at that time sustain'd The Envy of the Faction, who were bent To overthrow the Church and Government; But Juxon, tho' the Publick knew he ow'd His Rise alone to th'amity of Laud, Did an unblemish'd Character support, Throughout the City, Country, and the Court, Looking with so much Foresight e'ery way, That his embarrass'd Prince would often say, Juxon's Advice was hard to be obtain'd, But always prov'd successful when 'twas gain'd. Therefore if any Fault he had to stain The glorious Mem'ry of so great a Man, 'Twas when the Crown and Commons disagreed, His not advising oft as there was need. But humane Wisdom teaches Man to fly, As well as Instinct, Dangers that are nigh; Both are too apt to tempt us to postpone All others Safety to preserve our own. No Subject could the Treasury command With a more upright Soul or frugal Hand; For he enrich'd the Coffers of his Prince, Yet paid those Debts that had been due long since, And having no Relations of his own To tempt him to encroach upon the Throne, Consulted nothing but a wise and just Discharge, and true improvement of his Trust, That all he did might faithfully redown To th'Honour and the Int'rest of the Crown. Thus, above all Men, he enjoy'd the Fame Of managing that Post most free from Blame, And by his Conduct prov'd himself the best That in so high a Station e'er was blest; Living unblam'd, when he with weeping Eyes Saw his kind Master fall a Sacrifice, And pass with Patience thro' the Crimson way, Instead of Milky, to eternal Day But tho' the Rebels Fury run so high As to o'erthrow the Pow'r of Majesty, The Rev'rend Prelate kept himself still free From factious Malice or Indignity. Till Providence restor'd the Royal Son, And justly fix'd him in his Father's Throne, Then Pious Juxon ventur'd to succeed His Friend, who for his Vertues lost his Head, And shew'd himself as equal to the Pow'r, As the good Man that sate as high before. At Lambeth Palace built a lofty large Commodious Hall at his own proper Charge, Did sundry publick Charities too great And manifold to here enumerate, Living a bright Example to the Gown, And dying, left surviving Deeds to crown His Mem'ry with indelible Renown. THE CHARACTER OF Dr. Williams, Bp. of Lincoln. Endow'd by Nature with discerning Parts, And deeply learn'd in all Scholastick Arts, Was for his silver Tongue a Bishop made, When Royal James the British Scepter sway'd, And when the great unhappy Bacon fell, Was rais'd to be Lord-Keeper of the Seal, But in the first of Charles was with disgrace Remov'd from that high tott'ring envy'd place. Then with Revenge and Indignation fir'd, Into his Lincoln Diocess retir'd, Where, for ten Years, within his Bishop's Seat, The Prelate liv'd most hospitably great, Where all the neighb'ring Enemies to Court And Church were welcome daily to resort; To whose repugnant Tempers he apply'd New Arts to heighten their dissenting Pride, And to improve the Malice that began To threaten Laud his Metropolitan, To whom he now declar'd himself to be An open and contentious Enemy, In publishing a Tract to undermine The painful Primate's excellent Design To purge the Church of Errors, and restore Those ancient Rites confirm'd by lawful Pow'r, Which had been lost or curtail'd by degrees, To ease the Pride of tender Consciences; Therefore that Party highly did commend The Bishop's Treatise, which was shrewdly penn'd, Wanting no Learning or Imbellishment, That Art could give or humane Brain invent, Yet was it thought too light in e'ery Page, For rev'rend Lawn, grey Hairs, and wither'd Age: At length his fiery Zeal betray'd his Tongue, To do his Prince at his own Table wrong, In broaching a Report, which, if his own, Was a false Mischief level'd at the Throne; If true, 'twas what he ought to have conceal'd, Because 'twas by the King to him reveal'd; Therefore each way he did himself expose To th'danger of the Laws and of his Foes; Both which, indeed, severe Advantage took, Altho' this slender hold the Prelate broke: But for suborning Witnesses, at last, His Enemy at Lambeth held him fast; And when found guilty, to his open Shame, Was Fin'd, Confin'd, Suspended for the same; Yet after this hard Usage, having lain Some Years a Neighbour to the Lyon's Den, When Faction trespass'd on the Sov'reign Pow'r, The gracious King releas'd him from the Tow'r. But too impatient to be pleas'd or aw'd, He still continu'd his Revenge to Laud, And back'd the foul invet'rate Speech of Lord Say, Against His Grace, who then in Prison lay, Using his utmost Logick to incline The King, against all Gratitude, to sign The Death of Strafford, which presag'd his own, And prov'd so fatal to the sinking Throne. Yet, after all the subtil Arts he'd us'd, Whereby the Sov'reign Pow'r had been abus'd, The King advanc'd him to the See of York, In hopes to bind his Hands from factious Work; But all in vain, for nothing could engage So loose a Temper in so vile an Age, Still soothing Majesty to think he meant Well to the Church, the Throne, and Government, Till he in Person led the Rebels on, And wrested from the Crown a Garison. Then injur'd Goodness cast him off as Dirt, And gave him no more Countenance at Court: But now the Prelate was so haughty grown, Upon the signal Service he had done To the rebellious and aspiring Side, That even they abhor'd him for his Pride, At length his bold imperious Insolence Did both the Lords and Commons so incense, That his Deportment, and his proud morose Petition, fram'd against the Upper-House, Sign'd by twelve Bishops, caus'd 'em to be sent To th'Tow'r, where, after they some Months had spent, All their whole Order were, by Act, unheard, Of voting in the House of Peers debarr'd; And the proud Prelate, who had chiefly been The Sluce that let these flowing Mischiefs in, Of all the suff'ring Fathers, in the End, Liv'd most abhorr'd, and di'd without a Friend, Which shews God's Justice will have no regard To sacred Hypocrites in Church preferr'd, But punishes in them the wilful breach Of all those Duties they to others teach. A.D. 1636. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Twelfth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1636. This Year the King improv'd his Royal Fleet To sixty Sail, with Men and Stores compleat, As gallant able Ships as e'er were known To plough the Seas in service of the Throne, The King conferring now the Chief Command Of Lord High Adm'ral on Northumberland Earl of, Who sailing Norward with intent to scowr The British Ocean, with his Naval Pow'r, Found many Holland Busses who had crost The Seas to fish upon the English Coast, And falling in amongst 'em took the best Of a large number, and dispers'd the rest. This unexpected Usage gave the Dutch A sudden Shock that discompos'd 'em much, Who, at that time, were in a great degree Subsisted by our English Fishery: Nor had they only thus encroach'd upon The Rights belonging to the British Crown, But claim'd a boundless freedom on the Seas, To fish de jure where themselves should please, As Grotius, to oblige the Flemish Land, Had in his Mare Liberum maintain'd, Penn'd by the Instigation of the States, 'Twixt them and us to animate Debates, At such a Juncture when their Naval Pow'rs, They knew, were far superior to ours. Which Book was now well answer'd by the Hand Of our Learn'd Selden, at the King's Command, Which he delay'd, till he had Force by Sea Sufficient to maintain his Royalty, A more prevailing Argument to gain The Point in contest, than the keenest Pen; And then, and not till then, the King thought fit That Selden's Mare Clausum should be writ, When he'd a gallant Navy to proclaim His Empire of the Seas where'er they came, And with their loud-mouth'd Advocates confute Whoe'er should on the Main his Right dispute; For Princes must be wrong'd, unless they're known To've Pow'r sufficient to defend their own. The Dutch perceiving that the English Fleet Was grown, in haste, so formidably great, Were fearful, notwithstanding all their Pride, To make the narrow Breach, as yet, more wide, Or to resent the Busses they had lost, By Fishing, without leave, upon our Coast; But thought it rather for their Country's good, To humbly reconcile the growing Feud, And own the King's Dominion of the Seas, His Royal Anger timely to appease, Before these dangerous ill-boding Jars Were, by delay, improv'd to open Wars; Accordingly the States-United sent A Supplication to the Government, Beseeching now, that they might Fish with leave, A Favour which the Crown vouchsaf'd to give: Which condescending Suit the Diff'rence clos'd, And was the only End the King propos'd. Thus all Dominion must be held by Might, For he that's low in Pow'r has little Right; And the disputed Claim will fall in course, To him that has the longest Sword or Purse. The Charges of the Navy now were grown A Burthen so excessive to the Throne, That the King's Coffers, tho' with Caution us'd, Were to an ebb of emptiness reduc'd: Nor could his Friends advise more ready Ways, For such Supplies as he desir'd to raise, Than that His Majesty forthwith should send His Writs, which only did at first extend To Counties Maritime, now through the Land, Believing few would the Demand withstand. This the King did, with all convenient haste, Most People paying what they were assess'd; Tho' some most disaffectedly refus'd, And others thought themselves too hardly us'd. The Clergy, more particularly, made Complaint of their Assessments, tho' they paid, Which caus'd the King, by Letters, to command The Sheriff of each County in the Land, To take due Care the Gown should be assess'd No higher than His Letters had express'd. His Majesty now willing to convince The Disaffected, by the fairest means, Did, for the satisfaction of those few Who clamour'd and refus'd to pay their due, Write to the Judges, to require of all, Their just Opinions, joint and several, Whether he might not, by his Writs, demand A needful Aid, for safety of the Land, To furnish Shipping, Ammunition, Men, And all things fit and useful, to maintain The Welfare of the Realm in good defence, Against all threat'ning Perils that commence, And for so long as he himself should see 'Twas proper for the Land's Security: And whether the sole Power does not lodge Within the King, to make himself the Judge, First of the Danger, how he should provide, And when preventive Means should be apply'd. To which Demands the Judges all as one, Return'd the following Answer to the Throne, 'Twas their Opinion, that when publick Good, Or Safety of the Realm in danger stood, That then the King might by his Writs demand What Summs were needful to defend the Land, And by due course of Law his Fleet enlarge, And furnish Shipping at the Peoples Charge, With Men, and all things that should useful be, In time of Peril, for Security: And that if any should refuse to pay, He might, by Law, compel them to obey: That the King also was the Judge alone O'th' Danger, what was fittest to be done, And when most proper to prevent the same; To which Opinion each subscrib'd his Name; Nor did One Sage of all the Twelve recede, But with the rest, in e'ery Point, agreed. How then could Faction, with invenom'd Sting, For this Proceeding so reproach the King, As not consistent with the Nation's Laws, When all the Judges thus affirm'd it was? But inbred Malice, Envy, and Disgust, Love to shoot flying at the Brave and Just. The King, amidst his Wants, much pleas'd to find The Judges, at this Juncture, of a Mind, Caus'd their Opinions to b'inrol'd in all The Courts erected in the Minster-Hall, Concluding what he now had wisely done, To be sufficient Warrant for the Crown, To prosecute all those who'd disobey'd His lawful Writs, and Opposition made. The Person most remark'd of all, whose Name Was Hambden, of the Shire of Buckingham, Who, in his Clamours, having prov'd the worst Defaulter, was proceeded with the first, In the Exchequer, where he practis'd all The Means he could to his Assistance call, And still maintain'd the Contest, tho' in vain, For by no Querks or Struggles could he gain Acquittal of the Court, till, in the close, A higher Pow'r thought fit to interpose. Thus Faction always proves a sturdy Friend To him that with his Sov'reign durst contend, That by o'ercoming what is Just and Right, Their own black Projects may appear more white. The End of the Twelfth Year. THE CHARACTER OF Sir John Finch, Lord-Keeper. Bred in the Briary Province of the Laws, Where Justice lies perplex'd 'twixt Cause and Cause But did not in his greener Years apply So close to Books, as some that rise thereby, Affecting rather, for Diversion's sake, More Freedoms than a Student ought to take, Which made a Sedentary Life appear A dull Restraint, too lonely and severe, That he was scarce by Rival Pleaders thought To have, in Law, the Reading that he ought; Yet wanting not a sharp discerning Sense, A ready Wit, and useful Confidence, He to the Bar with diligence apply'd, And oft appear'd on the successful side, Till he an equal Reputation shar'd With those who'd labour'd in the Law more hard; And siding with the Court in all that lay Within his Sphere, or happen'd in his way; At length was honour'd with a Scarlet Badge Of Royal Favour, and was made a Judge, And then with more than ord'nary Zeal took up The Ship-Money where Noy had let it drop, Prevailing by his Arguments with all His supercilious Brethren in the Hall, To own the Levies that the Throne had made, Were done by Law, and ought to be obey'd; Tho' they had cause soon after to repent Their over rash Opinions and Consent; But Finch, his Zeal and Service to reward, Was to the gainful Purse and Mace prefer'd, Where he seem'd also ready to exert His utmost Pow'r in Service of the Court, And was at all times an obliging Lord, To any Order from the Council-Board, Believing their Commands alone to be Sufficient to direct a just Decree: But all these Condescensions, at that time, Brought no great Honour to the State or him, For prying Faction had their watchful Eyes On every side to make Discoveries: And when the Senate were dispos'd to rake Into past Faults, and e'ery grand Mistake, And Ship-Money, among the rest, was thought A great Oppression, and in question brought, His frighted Lordship into Holland fled, To shun their Fury and preserve his Head, Which had so active been in those Affairs, That rais'd Disputes and brought on Civil Wars. Hence we may see how hard 'tis for the Great To be secure in a divided State, When one Side seeks and labours to destroy The trusty Friends the adverse Side imploy. THE CHARACTER OF Lord-Keeper Littleton. By Nature bold, couragious, and discreet, His Person graceful, and his Parts compleat; By Birth of no inferior Degree, Descended of a Shropshire Family, Where, from his Parents, he enjoy'd a fair Estate, sufficient for a prudent Heir; By Education copiously supply'd With all such Learning as the Schools provide: This, in the Law, he carefully improv'd, By painful Study, which he greatly lov'd, Till he had conquer'd what such Crowds pursue, And tam'd that Hydra, master'd but by few, Tracing the winding Maze in e'ery part, That knotty Science interwove with Art, Till he had made that easy by degrees, So much involv'd in Doubts and Mysteries. Nor did our old Records escape his Pains, Those musty Scrolls that puzzle humane Brains; For by Learn'd Selden's help he made his Head The Ark where all Antiquity was laid. When thus accomplish'd for the highest Call, He soon became the Wonder of the Hall, Advancing, till esteem'd, at early Years, Among the highest Rank of Practicers, Climbing, by sudden Strides, from Post to Post, To the best Honours that the Law could boast, Was chose Recorder Of London. that first Step to Pow'r, And next made General-Solicitor: From thence removing to the Common-Pleas, Sat Chief of all that Bench of Justices, A Station he maintain'd with great Applause, And prov'd therein an Honour to the Laws, Discharg'd his Trust with unsuspected Care, Made quick dispatch, and wisely manag'd there. But when the Keeper Finch forsook his Pow'r, And fled for Safety to a Foreign Shore, No Person, by the Throne, was thought so fit As Littleton to fill that vacant Seat. According as the King had thus approv'd, The Judge was to the Chancery remov'd, There made a Peer, in such precarious Times, When Truth and Justice were misconstru'd Crimes, Especially in those that join'd the Court, And labour'd for its Int'rest or Support. This was adjudg'd to be the Cause alone, Why Littleton was call'd so near the Throne, Hoping his Wisdom in the Nation's Laws Might render him of use in Strafford's Cause, Who then was Pris'ner in that fatal Place The Tow'r, to gratify the Factious Race: But the wise Judge, not forward to withdraw His Loins from the soft Cushion of the Law, No sooner chang'd his native Air, but lost His Spirit in his new fatiguing Post, And seem'd to fail of Courage from that time, Like English Mastiffs when they change their Clime. Nor did he to the Earl perform the least Good Office, when by Faction sore opprest, Or cite one Law, to favour or defend His Life, altho' promoted to that End; Nor did he ever, in that Seat of Pow'r, Appear to be the Man he seem'd before, Which some believ'd was owing to the bad Effects of Sickness he had lately had; But others thought the mighty Change arose From Dangers he foresaw, but kept 'em close Within his strugling Breast, not knowing who He safely might impart those Secrets to; And this alone, as he confess'd to Then only Mr. Hyde, Caus'd him t'appear so much dissatisfy'd, Owning that in the Common-Pleas he knew The Persons there with whom he had to do; Was also able to sustain the weight Of Bus'ness, when upon that Bench he sat; But since he had been honour'd with the Seal, He knew not those with whom he had to deal, Was also often plung'd into Affairs, With which he'd ne'er been 'custom'd to converse: Nor had he such a Friend with whom he might Confer, in doubtful Points, to set him right: Declaring also he was griev'd to see The King abus'd with so much Treachery; For that his Councils were betray'd by those About him, to his ill-designing Foes, Blaming with Anger, obvious in a Frown, The Senate's rash Proceedings with the Throne, Saying, they scarce would make so great a stir, Unless they were resolv'd to still do more; That he foresaw, too plain, the sad event Would be a War 'twixt King and Parliament. Yet he that could foretel to Mr. Hyde These things, with such reluctance as he did, Was one of those that fell beneath the Curse Of making what he blam'd abundance worse; For tho' the Bounteous King had made him Great, And kindly rais'd him to that tott'ring height, In the Peers House, he never after shew'd One signal Instance of his Gratitude, But rather thwarted what the Throne design'd, And with the Faction, for his safety, join'd, So far, that when the House of Lords had put The Case of the Militia to the Vote, His Lordship, who so well the Matter knew, Voted against King, Law, and Conscience too. As if his Courage was intirely sunk, Or Factious Fumes had made his Reason drunk. 'Tis true, when the good King, who had observ'd How much the Lord had from his Int'rest swerv'd, And sent from York The King at that time residing there. a Servant to demand The Seal from out the wav'ring Keeper's Hand. After some hesitation he comply'd, And freely gave up what he first deny'd, Foll'wing the Seal he to the King had sent, T'avoid the angry Gripes of Parliament, Well knowing had he staid within their Pow'r, Their highest Mercy would have been the Tow'r. The King well-pleas'd he'd stoop'd to his Command, Permitted him to kiss his Royal Hand. And this was all his Lordship did t'attone For many Mischiefs he had done the Throne. Which, when the Commons their Allegiance broke, From a small Acorn rais'd him to an Oak, Hoping he might have serv'd the Loyal Side, And stem'd the Current of the Factious Tide. But spight of all his Knowledge in the Laws, The Judge, when made a Peer, mistook the Cause. Thus Men, when rais'd into a lofty Sphere, Their Safety to their Honour oft prefer, And change their Sides, according as they find The chance of things, concurrent with their Mind. But he deserves, who plays thus fast and loose, Much rather Condemnation than Excuse; For none in danger should the Gods distrust, But boldly stand or fall by what is just. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Francis Windebank. Among the Papists he was much esteem'd, Therefore himself, by some, a Roman deem'd; And when he held the pow'rful Pen of State, Was with that Party thought to be too great: For Priests condemn'd, he Pardons oft procur'd, And favour'd those who were in Jayls immur'd, Releasing sev'ral, which provok'd the Wrath Of such that triumph'd in a nearer Path. So that when Factious Insolence run high Against the Throne, and Pop'ry was the cry, And the industrious Commons over-aw'd The Church, and charg'd High-Treason upon Land, Whilst Windebank was sitting in the House, Some Members sev'ral Warrants did produce Under his Hand, in order to discharge Certain known Priests, who had been set at large, The House resolving to proceed therein, To gratify their Zeal and Factious Spleen, Accordingly Sir Windebank, who knew His Fault, by Order of the House, withdrew To the Committee-Chamber, where he staid Till Night, much shock'd, dejected, and dismay'd, And then had leave to homewards make his way, But strictly order'd to attend next Day. The Knight observing that the House were bent To run full tilt at Church and Government, And knowing well how useful he had been To Priests and Papists, to oblige the Queen, And that he'd oft presum'd to strain a Point, That might endanger Life, at least Restraint, Thought speedy Flight the best and surest way To save his Neck, which at their Mercy lay, E're Light appear'd accordingly withdrew, To shun the violence of a factious Crew, The Commons hearing of the Knight no more, Till safely landed on the Gallick Shore, Where he'd the satisfaction to defy The Rage of those who carry'd things too high. Bless'd are those Times when Men have only cause To dread the equal Justice of the Laws, When neither Party Malice shall oppress The Good, nor partial Favour skreen the Base.

      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II. A.D. 1637. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1637. A diet being call'd, the King sent o'er The Earl of Arundel Ambassador, T'Imperial Ferdinand the Third, to treat About restoring the Palatinate: But the Bavarian Duke, who had possess'd The Upper-Part, in all Degrees the best, With the Elect'ral Dignity, would not To any Terms or Overtures be brought; That whatsoe'er upon that Head was mov'd By the King's Agent, ineffectual prov'd, Tho' the young injur'd Prince, who had been thrown, By's Brother, out of his Dominion, Might have, on hard Conditions, been restor'd To the Low'r-Part; but th'interceding Lord Reply'd, he'd no Instructions to agree On less than the whole Principality; Could therefore on no Terms conclude, that might Diminish or impair th'Elector's Right. Which Answer to the Emp'ror put an end To the Negotiation then in hand, And left the Prince still wandring in distress, Without the hopes or prospect of Redress, Excepting some advantage that might spring From his own Sister's Marriage with the King Of Poland, but the Match, tho' near agreed, Did not according to his Wish succeed, For the sly Jesuits did the same prevent, Because the Princess was a Protestant, And stir'd the Polish Clergy to exclaim Against their King's espousing such a Dame, That now the Prince was of all hopes bereft, And only to the Care of Heaven left. This Year January 14. that Factious Scribler William Pryn, A noted Barrister of Lincoln's-Inn, A daring Man, of singular Renown Among the Party that oppos'd the Crown, Was, for dispersing Libels, with intent To slander both the Church and Government, Convicted, by substantial Evidence, In the Star-Chamber, after long defence. John Bastwick, a Physician, fam'd by those Who were their injur'd King and Kingdom's Foes, Was censur'd also for Aspersions thrown Upon the Court of High-Commission, He having stood accus'd some time before, And to the Gate committed by that Pow'r, Where he remain'd close Pris'ner for the Fact Of Publishing a shrewd Seditious Tract Flagellum Pontificis &amp; Episcoporum Latialium.. During which time he boldly did exert His Pen against the High-Commission-Court, Framing base Libels to oblige the view Of Faction, more particularly two A Latin Apology, Ad Præsules Anglicanos: And, A Litany against the High-Commission Court.. A third Offender, posted in the Reer, Was Burton, a disgusted Minister, Who having serv'd at Court, and turn'd from thence, Had, in a Sermon, given great Offence, Preach'd on that Day which Rome design'd should be The time of her conflagrant Massacre. All were Convicted, and, without redress, Sentenc'd to pay five thousand Pounds a piece, To stand on Scaffolds in the Palace-Yard, There each alike to have his Ears close par'd, And, during Life, to sep'rately be shut In distant Prisons from the Town remote; But Lawyer Pryn, who had been Cast some Years Before, and sentenc'd to resign his Ears, For writing and exposing what had been Condemn'd and censur'd as against the Queen Pryn's Histriomastix., With S and L Slanderous Libeller. was branded on each Cheek, That his mark'd Face his punish'd Crimes might speak, A cruel Postscript added by the Bench, To gratify the Lord Chief Justice Finch. Which Judgments were inflicted on the Three, With nothing less than due Severity, Such that occasion'd some to think it hard No part of so much Rigour should be spar'd. For Pity oft will lawful Justice blame, Tho' stubborn Folly has deserv'd the same. The Princely Brothers The Elector Palatine add Prince Rupert. now to Holland went, Designing well what fail'd of the Event; For going over pre-assur'd from hence Of the King's Purse, to answer their Expence, His kind Assistance and his Royal Care To help 'em, gain'd the Two such Credit there, That at a needful Juncture they obtain'd The Prince of Orange as a useful Friend, And so prevail'd with the United States, That to assist the Brothers in their Streights, They rais'd a slender Army underhand, To be at the Elector's sole Command, Who with a Body of Five thousand Men Advanc'd before the Town of Lemmingen, Which they besieg'd, but Hatsfield One of the Emperor's Generals. with a Force Superior much, in able Foot and Horse, Surrounded and compel'd 'em by surprise, To fight beneath great Disadvantages, That full Two thousand of the Prince's Men Were in the wreaking Field of Battle slain, And many Pris'ners taken on the Spot, Among the rest Prince Rupert had the Lot To be detain'd, and that brave English Peer The Earl of Craven, once so famous here: The Prince Elector, by a timely Flight Escaping, when he found he'd lost the Fight, The poor remains dispersing as they cou'd, To shun Captivity or loss of Blood. Thus injur'd Princes, by resisting Fate, Are often made still more unfortunate. Which shews the Justice we below profess, Is but a doubtful Warrant for Success. Williams, of Lincoln Bishop, and a shrewd Discerning Man, more opulent than good, Who'd been remov'd about ten Years before, From that great Post of Lord High Chancellor, Was charg'd with Subornation, guilty found, And by the Chamber Star-Chamber, July 11. fin'd Ten thousand Pound, Also in Prison to remain immur'd, During the Pleasure of his Sov'reign Lord. The Bishop made a strenuous Defence, But could not overthrow the Evidence, That he was forc'd with Patience to support Himself beneath the Sentence of the Court: Nor did the rig'rous Usage of the State Alone, in these Proceedings terminate; For tho' this Court their utmost length had run, The High-Commission had not yet begun, By Laud, Archbishop, as 'tis said, prepar'd, To use the sinking Prelate still more hard, Who had oppos'd that strict Conformity To th'Orders of the Church, injoin'd to be Observ'd by all the Clergy; but the late Archbishop Abbot. had vouchsaf'd to give so great A Latitude, that most had laid aside Those Rites with which they ought to have comply'd, Therefore resolv'd by the succeeding Lord Archbishop that the same should be restor'd, Whose just Endeavours Williams had withstood; And this had kindl'd that unhappy Feud, Suppos'd to be the Reason why his Guilt The weight of such strict heavy Justice felt; For the last Court, his Suff'rings to encrease, Strip'd him of Office and of Benefice Suspended him of both., Sequestring all Church-Incomes he possess'd To the King's Use, and left him thus distress'd. Archbishop Laud, upon the other's Fall, Within his Di'cess exercising all Church-Jurisdiction, hoping that he might Reclaim that See, and set the Clergy right, By whose Remisness the Dissenting Race Had taken Root therein, and thriv'd apace. In Edenburgh the discontented Kirk Of Scotland now began that fatal Work July 23., Which brought upon their kind indulgent Prince, And all his Realms, so sad a consequence; The first occasion of their Tumults there, When ripe for Mischief, was the Common-Pray'r, Which the good King was willing to advance, Against the Scotch Fanatick Ignorance, Pursuant to the Scheme his Father laid, When first the Kirk Episcopal was made, Who had an Act at Aberdeen obtain'd Of their Assembly An. Dom. 1616., to that pious End, Compiling, as by them impower'd to do, A Liturgy in order thereunto, That the Scotch Kirk with England might agree, And with Church-Worship hold Conformity; But for a better Kingdom left his Throne, Before he finish'd what he had begun; So that the Pious Management and Care Of this good Work devolv'd upon his Heir, Whose divine Soul was zealously inspir'd With all that such a heav'nly Task requir'd. Thus, by his Father's great Example led, The King had, Years before, some Progress made, And in his Royal Chapel In Edenburgh. introduc'd The Common-Pray'r, in hopes it might be us'd In other Churches, if the vulgar Ear Should pass the same with Approbation there: But this Essay, tho' many did attend The Service, yet it answer'd not the End; For this new form of Worship thus advanc'd, B'ing that of England, was discountenanc'd By the Scotch Bishops, fearing that in case They should the English Liturgy embrace, It might from thence be argu'd and maintain'd, Their Kirk did on the English Church depend; The Northern Prelates therefore did agree, To pray the King their Liturgy might be The same intended in King James's Reign, Pursuant to the Act of Aberden: Accordingly His Majesty comply'd, And they receiv'd the same well satisfy'd, Which, when by divers Bishops of their own, And Clergy then attending on the Throne, The Form was model'd to their Hearts content, Was Printed here, and into Scotland sent, Where all the Council readily agreed, In the Great Church St. Giles's. it should forthwith be read, And special Order given to proclaim In e'ery Church in Edenburgh the same, That all Men might have notice when and where They had appointed the new Form of Pray'r. This Publication fill'd the sacred Place, Upon the Day assign'd for English Mass; For so the Common-People were prepar'd, By some good Guides, to think it, e're 'twas heard, And therefore came not thither to agree Therewith, but to revile and mutiny; As it appear'd, for when the Rev'rend Dean Open'd the Bugbear Book and read therein, A number of the meanest sort began To clap their Hands, and loudly to prophane The Holy Service, deeming it to be A Jargon of the Dregs of Popery, Making an uproar and indecent Noise, That scar'd the rest, and drown'd the Reader's Voice, Tho' sev'ral Bishops, Counsellors of State, And all the neighb'ring Persons that were Great, Attended the Occasion to restrain And awe the Common People, but in vain; For in the Tumult a contentious Scot Jannot Gaddis. Snatch'd up the folding Stool whereon she sat, And cast it at the Dean with all her Might, To shew a rare example of her Spight, Crying aloud, within the Holy Place, False Thief, what dost thou at my Lug say Mass? Which sacred Insolence begat much more Disorder and Confusion than before; That then the Bishop, to appease the Storm, And stop their Rage from doing further harm, The Pulpit did ascend, in hopes to move The disobedient Flock to Peace and Love; But his Endeavours met with no regard, The Devil had too far possess'd the Herd, That they, instead of list'ning to the soft And moving Eloquence he us'd aloft, Had no respect to what the Prelate said, But threw their Cudgels at his Rev'rend Head. Th'Archbishop of St. Andrews much surpris'd To see the sacred Function thus despis'd, Call'd the Provost and Bailiffs from their Seats, In order to suppress these rising Heats, And to protect and guard the Holy Robe, From the rude Insults of the daring Mob; Accordingly they rang'd the Church about, And thrust the most suspected Rabble out, Till, with some hazard, they at length had clear'd The Iles of those who most were to be fear'd, And then the frighted Dean, as he design'd, When thro' the Service by the King injoin'd; The Mob secluded, conscious of no Crime, Pelting the Doors and Windows all the time; Yet they within pursu'd their good Intent, In due Obedience to the Government: But still the Peoples Rage, that smoth'ring lay, Surviv'd the sacred Office of the Day, And rather burnt the fiercer, when they found They could not stifle what they would have drown'd; For as the Bishop Of Edenburgh. to his House retir'd, A Gang, who had against his Life conspir'd, Assaulted him so roughly by the way, That had he not been rescu'd in the Fray, By pow'rful Hands, we reas'nably suppose He'd perish'd by the violence of his Foes. Thus when the scum of humane Race run mad, The wise and honest suffer by the bad. On the same Morning, tho' with pannick dread, At the next Church the Form was also read, But with much Noise and Tumult, to their Shame, Tho' not sufficient to impede the same, By Argyle's Bishop of Collegue likewise 'twas begun, But the good Man was scar'd from going on, By Curses, Threats, and the unbridl'd Rage Of such as fear'd no Blood nor Sacrile Two were suspended after Ramsey and Rollock. who refus'd To read it, fearing they should be misus'd, When they had heard the People so exclaim Against such Clergy as began the same. The Morning-Service having met this rude Unchristian Treatment from the Multitude, The Council sate as soon as Church was done, To stop Disorders in the Afternoon, Which were so well prevented by their Care, That no Indecence in the time of Pray'r Was offer'd, but the Service-Book begun And ended, as it ought, revil'd by none; Only the Rev'rend Bishop was, by some, Ill us'd that Evening in his Passage home; Nor did his Robe protect him from their Blows, For Factious Malice no distinction knows. The Magistrates, at first, seem'd much incens'd At all these Tumults that had been commenc'd, And such new Acts and Edicts undertook, As might the best promote the Service-Book, And make the Clergy safe that should advance The same, and give it all due Countenance; Two Letters sent to the Archbishop here, Entreating him to recommend their Care And faithful Zeal and Service to the King, In their promoting and establishing The Form of Pray'r, upon the Kirk injoin'd, In peace, according to his Royal Mind. These soothing Letters made the King recal That Rigour he design'd to've us'd with all Who had with so much Insolence withstood What he propos'd for both the Kingdom's good; But now he hop'd by Clemency to gain His Point, tho' Royal Mercy prov'd in vain; For by the time the Council had agreed The Book of Service should again be read, And had prefix'd a certain Day whereon This irritating Work was to be done, The Magistrates, who'd prais'd but just before Their great Fidelity to Sov'reign Pow'r, Had so far lent their condescending Ears To three perverse suspended Ministers Rollock, Ramsey, and Henderson., That they recanted, their Allegiance broke, And sided with the Herd against the Book, Petitioning the Council to postpone The Service till the Pleasure of the Throne Should, from the Royal Hand, be further known. Such of the Clergy also who were proud Of curry'ng Favour with the restless Croud, Petitioning the Council to suspend The Orders that injoin'd them to attend The Service also, since it could not be Perform'd with Safety or Indemnity. Thus Matters stop'd, the Harvest coming on, That nothing more was till October done, In which convenient Int'rim those that laid The Scene whereby these Tumults had been made, Imploy'd their Time so subt'ly to promote The turbulent Designs they had on foot, That by the Day Octob. 27. the Council had agreed To meet, and on the former Head proceed, The Town Edenburgh. was throng'd with all Degrees of Men, Who from remoter Parts were come to ken The truth of Matters, having heard the Work In hand was to subvert the Scottish Kirk, And to establish Mass, at least to change Their ancient Worship to some Form as strange; These Apprehensions caus'd the Multitude To prove so wild and insolently rude, That the first Day the Northern Council met, The noisy Crouds and Tumults were so great, They made three Proclamations to disperse The clam'rous Rout, who thereupon grew worse. The first importing, That no Church-Affair Should be debated whilst the Throng was there, Requiring all in Four and twenty Hours, In due Obedience to the High'r Pow'rs, To quit the Town of Edenburgh, unless Within the same they had a dwelling-place, That all such Persons should incur the Crime, Rebellion, if they tarry'd past the time. The second was in order to remove Their Sessions What we call our Term., lest it otherwise should prove A means of bringing in a vast resort Of Country-People to attend the Court. The third was to call in and to condemn To Flames the Fruits of a malicious Pen Intitled, A Dispute against the English Popish Ceremonies obtruded upon the Kirk of Scotland., Written to cast, in Scotland, a severe Reproach upon the Church-establish'd here. But these had small effect upon the Croud, Except to make 'em more perverse and rude; For as it happen'd on the foll'wing Day, The Diocesan Lord of Galloway, From the vile People met with great abuse I'th' Street, as moving to the Council-House, Which he no sooner enter'd but the base Tumultuous Rabble gather'd round the place, Where he and the Chief Justice were design'd To sit, b'ing in some special Matter join'd; But the invidious Rout, whose Fury ran Too madly high against the good old Man, Demanded a Surrender of the Guide, That's Blood might satiate their Revenge and Pride. The Treasurer who soon was advertis'd Of these Proceedings, at the News surpris'd, Came to the Bishop with uncommon haste, To help his Friend so barb'rously oppress'd, But soon as hous'd, to his discomfort found, That equal Dangers did himself surround; Whereon the City-Council and Provost Were call'd, to scatter this rebellious Host; But these, by daring Numbers over-pow'rd, With loss of Life were threaten'd if they stir'd, Before they'd sign'd a Paper to detest The Popish Book of Service, like the rest; And that they also should restore the Three Ramsey, Rollock, and Henderson. Suspended for their Nonconformity. No sooner had this Passage reach'd the Ear Of those within, but the Lord Treasurer And Earl of Wigston ventur'd to go down To th'House, where sate the Council of the Town, Hoping the Peoples Rage might be declin'd, Since their rebellious Scroll had thus been sign'd: Nor did they find the Fever of the Rout So high, but much abated, as they thought, Till from the Town-house they return'd, to free The Bishop, as they hop'd, from Jeopardy, Then were so rudely handl'd in the Street, By Ruffians frantick with unbridl'd Heat, That from the frighted Treasurer they took, As a free Prize, his Hat, White-Staff and Cloak, Both meeting with Indecencies so great, In passing back to th'Council-House of State, That they were forc'd in this distress to send For divers Lords and Gentry to defend Their Persons, such as had the Book oppos'd, And with the Peoples Bent and Temper clos'd, Who, by their Influence, restrain'd the Croud, And guarded those in Fear to Holy-Rood The House so called., Except the Bishop, who was safe convey'd To his own Lodgings, very much dismay'd. Let no Man be severe to gain his Ends, Since Foes in time of need may prove our Friends. Thus we may see the Proclamations made At the High-Cross, no other Issue had Than to incense the People but the more, And still to arm the Croud with greater Pow'r; For the first Factious Tumult that appear'd, Consisted only of the common Herd, And were decry'd by the superior sort, As Scum, that made all Sacred Things their Sport, But the best Citizens were found among The latter Croud, to Countenance the Throng, And methodize their impudent Demands Into Petitions sign'd by num'rous Hands, First boldly to the Council-Table sent Commissioners, who prov'd so insolent As to require that Power to restore Their Reader Henderson. and each silenc'd Minister, And to assure 'em that the Kirk should find Redress of all the Magistrates had sign'd. Soon after backing their Demands with two Petitions, their rebellious Heat to shew; One from the Men and Women of the Town Edenburgh., Children and Servants, to confront the Crown. The second in the Name of divers Peers, Knights, Gentry, Burgesses, and Ministers; Both to detest the Service-Book injoin'd Upon the Kirk, against the Peoples Mind. Thus many for Religion stickle hard, Who ne'er till then did any Faith regard, Nor e'er contended for the doubtful Right Of Holy Things, except to shew their spight. The last Petition to the King was sent, That Sov'reign Pow'r might know the Peoples bent, Whose Disobedience so displeas'd the Throne, That he resented highly what they'd done, And gave no Answer to the rude Contents Of their perverse unbridl'd Insolence, But order'd that the Council Of Scotland. should declare The great Aversion he should always bear To Superstition and to Popery, Reflected on his Crown and Dignity, By those tumultuous Spirits who had made These vile Commotions, hardly to be laid. The Northern Council apprehending now, That Lithgow was too near to Edenbrough, Adjourn'd their Sessions to a Town Sterling. remote, In hopes thereby to thin the Factious Rout. This done, the Lords the King's Commands obey'd, And at the Cross new Proclamation made, In order to disperse the Croud and clear The Town, where they as yet together were, Assuring them the King had no intent, But to maintain the Kirk and Government, As then establish'd, hoping this might be A means to stop their further Mutiny, Yet when the same was publish'd to the Herd At Lithgow, Sterling, and at Edenburgh, Whilst reading, 'twas receiv'd with Scoffs and Jeers, By the attentive Croud that lent their Ears, And when 'twas ended, Men of all Degrees, Lords, Gentry, Ministers, and Burgesses, With a vast conflux of the common Sort, Protested all, and made the same their Sport; And in pursuance of their bold neglect Of Sov'reign Power, and the disrespect And daring Disobedience they had shown To th'distant Ruler of the British Throne, They now began above the Laws to tow'r, And to invest themselves with Sov'reign Pow'r, Erecting Councils of their own to sit, Debate and govern as themselves thought fit; One Table of the disaffected Peers, A second of the Gentry, Commoners, A third of Burgesses, a fourth to be Consisting only of the Ministry, Chusing from them a Table of the best And wisest, to preside Called Commissioners. above the rest: And whatsoe'er these Ruling-Tyrants said Or did, was thro' the Land to be obey'd. Thus Rebels who oppose a Lawful Throne, Will stoop to num'rous Tyrants of their own, And be, with Patience, mis'rably opprest, By the worst Means, which they esteem the best. The End of the Thirteenth Year. Mr. William Pryn's CHARACTER. In Lincoln's-Inn, 'twixt Law and Gospel bred, For both he study'd, and in both was read, And having much delighted to converse With cavilling Divines, whose chief Discourse Was to perplex and criticise upon The Holy Myst'ries of Religion; And partial to their own prepost'rous Dreams, Were for erecting new Reforming Schemes: From such Communication had he drawn A venemous dislike to Rev'rend Lawn, And to the Church contracted so much hate, That it begot irrev'rence to the State, A Factious pitch to which they surely rise, Who do her sacred Discipline despise; These strong Aversions cherish'd by a proud, Imperious Nature, arrogant and rude, Prompt him to vent and gratify his Spleen, In sev'ral Libels insolently keen, Which did much hurt, but to himself the most, For his loose Pen his Ears and Freedom lost, And brought his shameful Cheeks at last to wear The odious Mark of Sland'rous Libeller; Whose Learning, had it been but well imploy'd, Had made him happy, but his Zeal and Pride, Commix'd with Malice, did his Judgment blind, And turn'd to Filth the Riches of his Mind. So Beauty is a Blessing to the Chaste, But proves a Curse when sinfully embrac'd. THE CHARACTER OF Dr. John Bastwick. A crackbrain'd Mortal, who had taken care To glean more Learning than his Head could bear, Latin and Physick he had read, 'tis true, But wanted Wit to temper what he knew, In Camps and Schools he'd Educated been, And got a Foreign Doctorship therein: A Leyden Titular, of no Degree At Home in either University; To both a Stranger here, nor was he known To th'College of Physicians, or the Town, Till noted for a Latin Tract he writ, Stuff'd full of Malice, temper'd with some Wit, Against the Rev'rend Bishops, to revile That Holy Order, in a taking Style, And to prophane th'establish'd Church to please Her factious, proud, dissenting Enemies, Printed in Holland, and from thence convey'd To London, there with great Industry spread: And that the Faction's Modesty might seem Like their Obedience to the Pow'r supreme, The spightful Tract was tender'd Dedicated. to the King, Most humbly, as a worthy Offering; A bold provoking Insolence that none But such a Tribe could offer to a Throne. However, he that penn'd the goodly Piece, And cloath'd his Malice in a Latin dress, Was soon severely handl'd by the Laws, And made a Suff'rer for the Good Old Cause, Had his Ears crop'd to recompence the Pains Impos'd by Faction on his fiery Brains, And was debarr'd of Freedom, to restrain The danger of so bold and keen a Pen. Thus Wit and Learning, lest the Mind's supply'd With Wisdom, that superior cautious Guide, Are two-edg'd Swords, by which we Mischief do, Not only to ourselves but others too. THE CHARACTER OF Mr. Henry Burton. When James of Scotland rul'd the British Throne; Burton attended Charles the Royal Son, As Closet-keeper, daily to prepare, At Chapel-hours, the Prince's Books of Pray'r, And having for some Years that Post possest, At length took Orders and became a Priest; Soon after which the King fell ill and dy'd, And Royal Charles his Father's Seat supply'd, Continuing Doctor Neyl Bishop of Durham. who long had been Clerk of the Closet in King James's Reign, Which Station Burton challeng'd as his due, And at the loss thereof impatient grew, Complaining with a loud indecent Tongue, 'Gainst Bishop Neyl, as if he'd done him wrong; At Court committing, with a shameless Face, Such saucy Errors, to his Gown's Disgrace, That, to his Scandal, he was banish'd thence, By Inhibition, for his Insolence. This Usage gave fresh Venom to his spight, And rais'd his Fury to a greater height, That his vile Malice was improv'd, frome one, To all the Fathers dignify'd with Lawn; And now turn'd Lecturer, that he might rail Aloud against the Lords Episcopal. By which engaging Methods, by degrees, He gain'd upon our English Pharisees, And wanted not a Tribe to animate And praise him for the veh'mence of his Hate, Which pleas'd those Hypocrites who seldom fail T'approve the Guide that teaches to rebel. Upon the Day appointed as a Fast, In Memory of Rome's intended Blast, He preach'd a Sermon so profusely full Of Malice, and so impudently dull, Against the Rev'rend Bishops, that the State Could not be mild with Insolence so great, But us'd him as an Enemy avow'd, With all the Rigour that the Laws allow'd, Condemning him, regardless of his Gown, For poys'ning others Ears, to lose his own. Also Five-thousand Pounds he was injoin'd To pay, and during Life to be confin'd. Thus does the Malice, level'd at the Great, By Fools, upon themselves reverberate; As Childrens Darts shot upright in the Air, Upon their Heads return, for want of Care. A.D. 1638. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Fourteenth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1638. The Scots, excited by the Faction here, Did e'ery Day more insolent appear, And having fix'd what they were pleas'd to call Their Tables, and their Table-General, The wild Assembly then presum'd to send A Summons for each Bishop to attend, And Excommunicated all, because They would obey no Lords against the Laws, Which render'd them so odious to the Crowd, That they were fearful to appear abroad, Whilst the Assembly govern'd uncontroul'd, And daily grew more dangerously bold, In Point of Faith proceeded to revive An old Confession stil'd the Negative, In which they forc'd not People to abjure The Pope alone, his Errors and his Pow'r, But sev'ral Rites and Principles as naught, Then by the Church of England us'd and taught: To which they also did annex a Band Or Covenant, imposing a Command On all, to swallow what they'd thus begun Without the Approbation of the Throne. The common People over-run with Zeal, Reproaching and chastising those with ill And shameful Usage, who refus'd to take The same, altho' deny'd, for Conscience sake, By the Learn'd Heads of sev'ral Colleges, Professors in their Universities, Many grave, sober, rev'rend Parish-Guides, And numbers of the Laity besides, Because they knew, by Statutes of their own [illeg.]0 of Mar. Act. 75. 10 Jac. 6. Act. 72., That all Assemblies call'd, without the Throne Had giv'n consent, were made Sedition. The King, displeas'd, as well he might, with these And other such like gross Indignities, After he'd promis'd they should have content, In all material Points of their Complaint, Resolv'd forthwith, by Power, to suppress What could not now be done by milder Ways: But Hamilton, whose Influence was great Upon the King, in all Affairs of State, Disswaded him from his intended Course, Alledging there was safer Means than Force, Off'ring himself to mod'rate and compose The growing Diff'rence, without Arms or Blows, Which so prevail'd upon the King, whose Mind Was much to Peace and Lenity inclin'd, That he impower'd the Marquis to repair To Scotland, as his High-Commissioner; But when he thither came he quickly found The new Reforming Clan had gain'd such Ground, That his best Measures were too weak to quell The dangerous Effects of frantick Zeal. For when the brainless Herd pretend to Grace, No Reason can restrain their wild Excess; Self-Interest then for Law and Justice stands, And gives a Sanction to their vile Demands. Nor could the Marquis stop their Holy Pride, Or make 'em lay their ill Designs aside: Nor by the fairest Promise or Pretence, Recov'r 'em to the least Obedience, Altho' he travel'd oft between the King And them, but could no satisfaction bring To either side, the Clergy of the Kirk, And their Confed'rates in the Holy Work, Had broke so far at once thro' all the Laws Of Scotland, to advance the Good Old Cause, That they would hear of nothing from the Throne, But thought, already, all the Land their own. At length the Privy-Council here advis'd The King, that he would graciously be pleas'd To let a strict and speedy View be made, Of those Petitions which the Scotch had laid Before him, and vouchsafe forthwith to grant The Pray'rs of all their Papers of Complaint, Perswading Royal Goodness any Course Was better, at that time, than open Force, To this the Sov'reign also gave consent, And Hamilton again to Scotland went, Believing nothing could a Peace impede, Since Majesty had first so far agreed: But crafty Faction still reserving more Than what they durst to ask of Sov'reign Pow'r, Had further Ends in Prospect, than to take The best Concessions that the King could make, Unless he'ad tamely giv'n 'em up his Crown, And never more pretended to the Throne, That still the active Marquis but apply'd In vain, to humble the Confed'rates Pride, Who'd new Objections daily to propose, To shew, no Terms would make the Rebels close; For tho' the Council there seem'd over-joy'd, That the kind Monarch had so far comply'd, As to establish by his Royal Pow'r, What they'd usurp'd against the Law before, And for the sake of Peace, and for their Ease, To grant 'em all desir'd Immunities: Yet when the Marquis, in his Native Land, Pursuant to His Majesty's Command, Had issu'd out, to give the Kirk content, The Proclamation which the King had sent, Containing all the large Concessions made By Majesty, provided they obey'd, The only kind Reception that they gave The grant of all they had presum'd to crave, Was by the factious Covenanters shew'd, In base Revilings and Ingratitude, And odious Pulpit clamours, to encrease The common Peoples Fears and Jealousies, That frighted and misled they might decline Their Prince's Bounty as an ill Design, Taking much Pains to vilify the Court Of England, lest their Reign should be but short, For Faction never thrive till they betray The giddy Croud to boldly disobey, Who by rank Teachers, full of Holy Pride, Must from their Duty first be led aside, That Zeal and Malice may prepare the way For crafty Knaves to make the Fools their Prey. The Scotch Confed'rates height'ning their Offence, By slighting thus the Favours of their Prince, And making all things desp'rate by their rude Deportment and absurd Ingratitude, The Marquis finding all Attempts in vain, With the King's leave, return'd to Court again; And then the Scots, to shew their drift, took care To speedily provide for open War, Inviting home Commanders from abroad, I'th' Service of the Dutch and Swede imploy'd, Seiz'd the King's Arms and Stores, and got Command Of most Strong-Holds and Castles in the Land, Made Alexander. Lesly, who was best esteem'd of all Their Officers, their Captain-General, He swearing to be true to them, and they Who took up Arms, all swearing to obey. And in this threat'ning Posture of Offence They stood, to justify their Insolence. Nor had the King been negligent the while, In raising Arms against his Native Soil, But early in the Spring was well supply'd With Force sufficient to chastise their Pride, Giving the Post of Captain-General To the Scots Foe the Earl of Arundel, Appointing Essex to command the Reer, Esteem'd at that time as a trusty Peer; Made Earl of Holland Gen'ral of the Horse. And thus both Sides prepar'd for Civil Wars. A bloody Scene the good Fanaticks here Were more inclin'd to propagate than fear, Who, above all Men, are precisely skill'd In pulling down, but know not how to build. The End of the Fourteenth Year. THE CHARACTER OF General Lesly, Earl of Leven. A valiant Scot, in Foreign Climates bred, Had been Lieutenant-Gen'ral to the Swede, And acted with Success beneath the Great Gustavus, (who at Lutzen met his Fate) Was by his Native Country first imploy'd, When Zeal had burst into Rebellious Pride, Leading Three-thousand Men into the Field, Poor rustick scabby Loons, in Arms unskill'd, Which he dispos'd upon a rising Brow, With such Advantage, that they made a show, As if they boldly stood prepar'd to charge The Enemy, with numbers twice as large: Which Stratagem gave Holland such surprise, So pall'd his Courage and deceiv'd his Eyes, That with superior Forces at his Back He halted, and was fearful to attack Their despicable Bands, which he might soon Have scatter'd, had he march'd but boldly on, And at that time, with loss of little Blood, Had early nip'd Rebellion in its Bud. But, without Action, he to York retir'd, And to the King reported and averr'd, Not what he really saw, but what he fear'd. This crafty Conduct soon produc'd as great Advantage to the Scots as a Defeat, And rais'd their Gen'ral's Reputation high, Who, without Blows, had made the English fly, Prevail'd upon the King to treat and yield To Grants they should have tug'd for in the Field, But never could have gain'd, had Holland fought Their ill-arm'd Forces, as at first he ought: But Royal Goodness hoping to prevent, By gracious Means, their further Discontent, Comply'd with all the craving Scots desir'd, To cool those Spirits too much Zeal had fir'd, And by his Condescensions, which were great, Reduc'd that Kingdom to a peaceful State; And in the time that he resided there, Did many Honours undeserv'd confer, Among the rest, old Lesly, who had led The Rebels, was the Earl of Leven made; For which he fawn'd and vow'd he'd never more Oppose the King, his Person, or his Pow'r, But serve him, when requir'd, in any Cause, Without reserve, or asking what it was, An outward true Scotch Compliment he pass'd Upon his Sov'reign, as it prov'd at last; For soon as Scotland laid their Heats aside, And with their kind forgiving Prince comply'd, Lesly, their Gen'ral, was to Ireland sent, With all his Force, by King and Parliament, That the Disorders there might be suppress'd, Which, at that Juncture, e'ery Day encreas'd; But when the Scots were forward to appear Again in Arms, to please the Rebels here, No sooner did they private Letters send To their new Earl, and old commanding Friend, But he their Summons instantly obey'd, And quite forgot the Promise he had made, Headed an Army for the Pious Work, And, joining Fairfax, laid close Siege to York. At Marston-Moor was forc'd to fly the Field, Where all his Army were dispers'd or kill'd, And when himself had run ten Miles in haste, Was taken by a Constable at last. But tho' the Scots such rugged Treatment found, Fairfax and Cromwel still maintain'd their Ground, And by the dint of Brav'ry won the Day, When all their Northern Friends were fled away, Whose Gen'ral, by some Stratagem, regain'd His Freedom, after he'd been Hours restrain'd, Which Fortune render'd the Defeat more great, And made the Loyal-Side less Fortunate. Thus the Scotch Hero, tho' he'd given his Word, Against the King to ne'er unsheath his Sword, Yet, without Hesitation, frankly shew'd His Country in his breach of Gratitude. However, after all his Service done, The Battles fought and Dangers he had run, Was laid aside, pretending that his Years Had render'd him unfit for War-affairs, Tho' 'twas to honour one of High Degree, With the same Post, as true a Scot as he. In Camp or Court 'tis difficult to find, Among the Great, an uncorrupted Mind; In both, too often, they abuse their Trust, Then strive, by force, to make their Actions Just. Sir Denzil Hollis's CHARACTER. The younger Brother of the Earl of Clare, A Gentleman of Parts and Character, Cry'd up by all the Factious Tribe that run With such precipitation 'gainst the Crown: Nor was there any Commoner more free, Or diligent, to serve their Ends than he; Yet must it be acknowledg'd he'd the Grace To no ways be concern'd in Strafford's Case, Who, to the Knight by Marriage was ally'd, Hugging his fruitful Sister for his Bride. None had among the Party greater Fame, For acting 'gainst the Court and Buckingham, Tho' for the same he after underwent A heavy Fine and sharp Imprisonment; Which he could ne'er forgive, but to the hurt Of both, oppos'd the Schemes of King and Court. Nor was the Knight inferior to the rest, Who, to promote Rebellion, did their best, But hunted with the Pack, who still pursu'd The Throne, and run in quest of Royal Blood, Till by their Factious Pains and cruel Care, They brought their wicked Purposes to bear; And by their Deeds so infamously base, Fix'd an eternal Odium on their Race. Thus wicked Men, by voluntary Deeds, First call down lawful Justice on their Heads, Then angry grow, and prompted by the Curse Of Prejudice, proceed from bad to worse. The Character of the Earl of Bedford, Son of the former. A busy Noble, destin'd to pursue The fatal Ends the Faction had in view, No Justice fear'd, nor evil Labour spar'd, To tread the Steps his Father had prepar'd; But at an Army's Head, in open Field, Against his injur'd Sovereign rebell'd, Tho' by a handful trusty to the Crown, Was kept by Hertford out of Sherborne Town, March'd to and fro and led his Troops in Pomp, But did no signal Service to the Rump, Except by his appearance in their Cause, T'encourage others to despise the Laws, And lend a plotting Head or active Hand, To work the ruin of their Native Land. 'Tis true, he did possess, with Holland's Lord, The Quarters of the King at Wallingford, But, in a little time, return'd from thence, Into those Quarters call'd the Parliaments. Thus march'd about in State, and shew'd his Pride, More than his Courage on the Rebels Side. However, none retain'd a greater Zeal For those who had inflam'd the Commonweal; As if he thought no Scandal could be worse, Than for the Son to steer a diff'rent Course, From what his Father had, with so much Care And labour, shap'd for his succeeding Heir. Thus when mistaken Parents lead the way, It is no wonder that the Children stray, For their Examples, if unjust or lewd, Become our ruin, and our rise if good. A.D. 1639. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Fifteenth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First. Anno Dom. 1639. The Royal Forces rais'd against the Scot, Consisting of Twelve-thousand Horse and Foot, Besides a Fleet with a sufficient Host On Board, to terrify the Scottish Coast, Were all compleatly ready in the Spring, T'obey at once the Orders of the King; Who also summon'd (whether Foe or Friend To the Scotch Cause) the Lords to all attend His Person, holding by the Laws a Right To call 'em when himself went forth to Fight, Hoping his splendid Pomp might have a good Effect, and stop the loss of Christian Blood. For fear of strength superior often makes The proud and daring bend their stubborn Necks. The most tyrannick Foe submissive grows, At sight of Pow'r too mighty to oppose, And rather will shake hands than hazard Blows. In March the Monarch drew his Army forth, And mov'd by slow Gradations tow'rds the North, Commanding Essex with the Lightest Horse, And Foot Two-thousand to augment his Force, T'advance before with unretarded speed, To the Hanse-Town of Berwick upon Tweed, And to possess, if possible, the same, E're Lesly's Northern Forces thither came, Accordingly he march'd both Night and Day, Meeting with sundry Scotchmen by the way, Who gave him strange Accounts, and prepossess'd The Earl of mighty Numbers they had rais'd, Affirming that the Scots, some Days before, Had got the Town of Berwick in their Pow'r; And that in case he ventur'd to go on, His Army would for certain be o'erthrown: With such Reports the Roads, as if by chance, Were lin'd, in hopes to stop the Earl's advance, And make the Scots, who were but weak, appear More ready, and much stronger than they were. The same surprising Shams were also carr'd To th'King, and by some Northern Lords averr'd, With this addition, that the Scots had met The Earl and giv'n him an intire Defeat; Which Fables were improv'd by some expert Seditious Nobles in the moving Court, But Truth was soon from all these Vapours clear'd And factious Impudence barefac'd appear'd; For the poor Arts they practis'd to impede The Earl, prov'd Wings to expedite his speed, That if the Scots should have possess'd the Town, His want of Haste might not incense the Crown: He therefore still march'd forward, finding no Appearance of a formidable Foe, Or any thing to obviate or retard His free possession of the Place desir'd, Which he soon enter'd, and dispatch'd from thence, To th'King, a Courier with Intelligence, That so abash'd those Nobles who had us'd Their Prince so ill that they were quite confus'd; Yet Sov'reign Goodness pass'd their Treach'ry by, Without Reflexion, or a Look awry. For Silence is allow'd the most discreet Resentment in a Prince, when 'tis not fit To punish, but more prudence to delay His Royal Anger to a future Day. The King, by this time, with his pompous Train Of Nobles added to his warlike Men, Had enter'd York, where he was early join'd By all the Northern Worthies well inclin'd, And some such Lords and Gentry who were known To be but ill-affected to the Throne, And rather came as undermining Spies Upon the King's Designs, than otherwise. However, they encreas'd the great Resort, And added still more Splendor to the Court, Wherein such Crowds of Scottish Lords appear'd, That now the Loyal English Nobles fear'd, The King's Designs were e'ery Day betray'd, And to the distant Rebels publick made; Therefore the Council-Board thought fit to frame A solemn Oath, for all Men to disclaim The Rebel's Side, abjuring the Offence Of giving to the Scots Intelligence; Also to strictly bind 'em to the Throne, In the most sacred Form that could be drawn, Hoping thereby to purge the Court of those Scotch Nobles they suspected to be Foes; Not doubting but the English Lords would take The same, and not the least Exception make. But when it came to be impos'd, the Scots All swallow'd down the Test with oily Throats, And none refus'd the Edict to obey, But those two factious Nobles Brook and Say, Alledging, That no Subject was confin'd To take an Oath, except by Law enjoin'd: That if His Majesty had cause to be Suspicious of their Truth and Loyalty, He might proceed against them as it best Became the pleasure of His Royal Breast: But since they were not legally requir'd To bind their Conscience, as the King desir'd, The publick Good forbid them to agree With what might hazard common Liberty. This gave the Court new matter of dispute, Which did not with the present Juncture suit; And tho' the evil Spirit that possest These two was not conspicuous in the rest, Yet the Discourses that each Day arose Upon the Subject, did so far disclose The Court's Distemper, that it plainly shew'd, Their standing out had done the King no good, Tho' all, both Scotch and English, had beside The Lords premis'd, without disgust comply'd; Therefore the factious Two that did appear So obstinately bold, committed were; But the King soon dismiss'd 'em and requir'd, That each to his own House forthwith retir'd. And now the Scots, with pannick Fear possest, The King with much Humility address'd, Expressing great Concern, that they should be Misrepresented to His Majesty; Assuring him, their Hearts could entertain No Disobedience to disturb his Reign, That they desir'd no more than to submit Their Grievance at their Sov'reign's Royal Feet; And that they did unfeignedly agree, All their Misfortunes should intirely be Determin'd by His Gracious Majesty. These crafty Fawnings, tho' it gain'd some Friends, Was not sufficient to obtain their Ends; For many mov'd by their submissive Style, Believ'd their smooth Dissimulation real; And therefore thought 'twas pity to proceed To Blows, when all might be without agreed. But the wise King appris'd of their Deceit, Did all their flatt'ring Stratagems defeat, And with his Army resolutely mov'd Tow'rds Berwick, tho' his March was disapprov'd By some about him, who began to fear Those Dangers which they now approach'd more near And therefore thought 'twas safest to compose The wid'ning Breach before they came to Blows. But the King, deaf to their Advice, march'd on, To the Scotch Borders, and beyond the Town Of Berwick pitch'd his Royal Tent, and there Incamp'd his Army in Rebellious Air, And hearing that the Scots, with all their speed, Were boldly moving forward tow'rds the Tweed, Commanded Holland, with an able Force, Of Foot Two-thousand, and Three-thousand Horse, Besides Artill'ry, to advance and fight The Rebels, wheresoe'er they came in sight; Accordingly he march'd, until he found The Scots drawn up upon a rising Ground, With so much Art, by Lesly, that he thought Their Number, which was scarce Three-thousand Foot, To be four-times as many as they were, Which so dispirited the dastard Peer, That he return'd in haste, without a Blow, When half his Forces might have crush'd the Foe, And by one home-attack prevented all Those future Woes that did the Land befal: But Fear or Treach'ry struck his Reason Blind, And pall'd the Native Courage of his Mind, That he retreated, to his shame, and lost The happy Juncture, to the Nations cost; And by preventing one small showr of Blood, Drown'd the whole Kingdom in a Crimson Flood; And when return'd, did to the Camp and Court, Make such a strange and terrible report Of what he'd seen, as if the Foe appear'd So vastly num'rous to be justly fear'd, That the King's trusty Friends, who were before For humbling Scotland, by the dint of Pow'r, Frighted with these Chimera's, chang'd their Mind, And to a Treaty now seem'd most inclin'd; The Scots dispatching to their English Friends, Such crafty Letters as might gain their Ends, Addressing in a Style that best might fit The Humours of the Men to whom they writ, Seducing many to believe they meant No Evil to the Church or Government; But so much Duty to the King profess'd, And such Submission in their Cant express'd, That the whole Court seem'd now convinc'd that words Would to both Sides more useful prove than Swords, And therefore wrought upon the King to treat, When he had Pow'r to force them to submit; But too much Mercy and his Friends Advice, Cast such a fatal Mist before his Eyes, That wanting careful Pilots he was steer'd Upon that Rock which Royal Wisdom fear'd. The King b'ing thus trepan'd into a Snare, Commissioners by both appointed were On the King's Part, the Earls of Pembroke, Salisbury, and Berkshire; Secretary Coke, and Sir Harry Vane. And for the Scots, the Earls of Rothes and Dumfermling, the Lord Lowden, the Lord Douglas, Alexander Henderson, and Archibald Johnston., Who with the greatest Expedition met, And after some short Wrangling and Debate, All Enmity forgot, and did agree, That both the Armies should disbanded be, The Forts and Castles render'd to the Throne, And all things bury'd in Oblivion; For Justice none to be reserv'd, because They urg'd, no Person had transgress'd the Laws, That an Assembly and a Parliament Should both forthwith be summon'd, with intent To make a full and lasting Settlement. Just as the King had sign'd the fatal Peace, Which prov'd the Source of England's Miseries, His Majesty's Scotch Adm'ral, who by Sea Had acted with concurrent Treachery, Came full of fawning Shams and crafty Querks, To pay the King a Visit at the Berks A spacious Field so call'd, lying beyond Berwick., Brought thither, 'twas conjectur'd, by the Fame O'th' Treaty, which was o'er before he came. Nor had he done more Service with his Force By Sea, than tardy Holland with his Horse, But corresponded with the Foe, and did More good than harm to the rebellious Side; And tho' his Country, e're he serv'd by Sea, Esteem'd him as their greatest Enemy: Yet e're he parted from the Camp he won Their Favour, to the Inj'ry of the Throne. The Army, who had done small good or hurt, B'ing now disbanded to oblige the Court, Altho' the Scots were by the Peace enjoin'd To've first perform'd the Articles they'd sign'd; However, Royal Goodness, to prevent Suspicion, b'ing advis'd to't, gave consent, And so return'd in much less Pomp to Town, Than he set out, which was no sooner done, But the Scots laughing in their Sleeves renew'd Their former Work, to shew their Gratitude, Using their Bishops basely, and with more Irrev'rence and worse rigour than before; Confirm'd their Edicts, gave out fresh Command Their Excommunications still should stand; And in their Publick Marts and Streets abus'd All those who had the Covenant refus'd, Publish'd such impious Papers to affront The Throne, as by the Hangmen here were burnt, Broke thro' the solemn Treaty they had made, To th'shame of those who had the King betray'd, And caus'd him by their Counsels to forsake Those Measures he was once resolv'd to take, Which if pursu'd according to his Pow'r, Had made them humble, and himself secure; But when the King was wrong'd on e'ery side, 'Twas hard to curb such daring Rebels Pride, Who, now his Forces were disbanded, teas'd His Royal Breast, and did what e'er they pleas'd, Richlieu the cunning Cardinal of France, Assisting all he could that might advance Their ill Designs, and move 'em to become More daring, insolent, and troublesome. Thus Princes Courts, like Harlots, hate to see Their Rivals flourish in Prosperity, Omitting no vile Arts to overthrow And bring each other despicably low. The King soon finding he abroad had lost Much Credit by his brave, but useless Host, In making such a Treaty when he'd Force Sufficient to have steer'd a better course, Grew much perplex'd he should be thus ensnar'd, And trick'd, amidst an Army for his Guard, Whilst those who found th'effects of their Advice, And saw, too late, they'd counsel'd him amiss, Tho' they meant well, as Clarendine asserts, Appear'd with stupid Looks and sinking Hearts, Each finding Friends, or other Means, to clear Himself and charge the oversight elsewhere, B'ing all, as they had cause, asham'd to own The guilt of so much Mischief to the Throne. However, since the King would not be brought To wholly drown so infamous a Fau't, On Secretary Coke the Blame, at last, By joint Contrivance of the rest, was cast, And the old Man, who had arriv'd almost At's Eighti'th Year, degraded of his Post, Whilst Hamilton, by Int'rest of the Queen, To the same Office rais'd Sir Harry Vane, The only Person Strafford least approv'd, And therefore by his Enemies belov'd. Besides, the Earl, so made but just before, Had Friendship for the Knight Sir Edward Coke. turn'd out of Pow'r, Who'd been of use to Strafford, who remain'd In Ireland, whilst the Scots their Point obtain'd. So that this Change created in the Court Some murm'ring, at a time not proper for't, And forc'd the Queen t'exert her utmost Pow'r, To perfect what she wanted to procure, Which, in a little time, produc'd such great Internal Burnings, both in Church and State, That many sad Disasters thereupon Ensu'd, destructive to the injur'd Throne, Tho' the first open Flames again appear'd Among the Scotch unfaithful scabby Herd, Who, when they can't be humbl'd, must be fear'd. For all Rebellious Ruffles are begun To try the Pow'r of him that rules the Throne; And if the Prince be tim'rous to enforce The Laws, by strength of Arms, he falls in course, A Letter intercepted now by chance, From treach'rous Scotland to the King of France, Was to the Royal Hand convey'd, to shew The base Designs of the Confed'rate Crew; By the chief daring Covenanters sign'd, And sev'ral Lords who in their Int'rest join'd, Particularly Lowden, then at Court, A Peer of Scotland, born for England's hurt, Wherein the Traytors made a sad Complaint “Against their Native Monarch's Government, “Imploring, in an humble Style, the Throne “Of France, to give the Scots Protection, “And send them such Assistance as might ease “Their Country of its great Calamities, “Begging one Colvil, whom they sent, might be “Receiv'd with Credit by His Majesty. This trait'rous Letter giving great Offence To all that lov'd their Country or their Prince, Lowden was call'd before the Council-Board, And strictly there examin'd, but the Lord No other Answer made than, That 'twas writ Before the late Scotch Treaty was compleat, Which coming early to a good event, The Letter was postpon'd and never sent; That if to any Crime it did amount, Scotland alone should call him to account, And therefore thought he justly might demand Leave to return into his Native Land. But the whole Council thought it not a time To slightly pass by such an odious Crime, A twofold Treason of the blackest kind, Not proudly, but revengefully design'd T'enslave both Kingdoms, had their bounteous Prince Proceeded to chastize their Insolence. The Council therefore made him know their Pow'r, And sent both Lord and Colvil to the Tow'r, The latter being taken in the Town, Who, for no good, was skulking up and down; All Men expecting they'd have soon been try'd, And for their vile Conspiracy have dy'd. This new Discov'ry gave the King a great Surprise, and shock'd his Ministers of State, B'ing all perswaded that such daring Plots As these, could not be thought of by the Scots, Unless they carr'd more Poyson in their Hearts, Than could be well expel'd by easy Arts. Besides, the Royal Treasure being spent In the last Summer's fatal Management, The King, amidst these Difficulties, met A select Council of the Cabinet, Who all, with one determinate Consent, Advis'd the Calling of a Parliament, To which the King as readily agreed, And sent out Writs with all convenient speed. When Northern Winds had conjur'd up a Storm, That threaten'd England with destructive harm, 'Twas hard the Pilot should be forc'd to steer For safety on those Shelves he'd cause to fear. The End of the Fifteenth Year. THE Earl of Salisbury's CHARACTER. Bred up at Court, in that deceitful Air, When the Scotch Monarch had the ruling Care, Descended from a Grandsire who had been A crafty Statesman to a glorious Queen; Son also to a Peer as Wise and Great As ever steer'd the British Helm of State; Who only left, when he departed hence, His Titles to his Children, not his Brains. In James's Reign the young surviving Lord Had been call'd early to the Council-Board, Where with such Zeal he did himself deport, And prov'd s'obsequious to the pompous Court, That he ne'er fail'd to do what they requir'd, But over-acted all that they desir'd; And from that time would vig'rously enlarge Whate'er he thought his Duty to discharge, None proving, among those of High Degree, So great a Tyrant, when in Pow'r, as he; Nor any Man more backward to obey Those Motives which should all Mens Actions sway, Few Words he us'd, except the Hound or Hawk Became the sporting Subject of his Talk, Concurring always in Affairs of State, With what the Crown propos'd, without Debate, Till his Mind chang'd, when things began to bear A diff'rent Face from what they us'd to wear, And then he run quite counter to the Throne, Undoing all that he before had done: Yet when the King to York his Progress made, The Lord went also thither, where he staid Till some fresh Motives did again convince His Thoughts, 'twas safest to desert his Prince. Then, mounting slily, stole away by Night, And, wing'd with Fear, tow'rds London took his flight And there, like a true Turncoat, gave consent To all things that were done by Parliament. And when the Rebels had subdu'd the Throne, O'erturn'd the Laws and made the Pow'r their own, And Bully Cromwel, when the Civil Wars Were ended, had dissolv'd the House of Peers, The trusty Lord made Int'rest and was chose A Member of the factious Common-House, There join'd in Consort, voted like the rest, And was as rank a Rebel as the best. Thus when the Great shall, thro' the poor pretence Of Pers'nal Safety, break through Honour's Fence, They seem less worthy to the Just and Wise, Than Scoundrels that from Dirt and Dunghil rise. THE Earl of Berkshire's CHARACTER. His Loyalty was firm, his Spirit great, But wanted Int'rest to assist the State: Near Oxford, by the Rump, was Pris'ner made, And from that County to the Tow'r convey'd, The House suspecting he was sent that way, T'enforce the King's Commission of Array, About the time the Standard was displaid, To call the Loyal to their Prince's Aid: But when the Rump were satisfy'd the Peer Was not a Person that they need to fear, They gave their Pris'ner Liberty, as one Hurtless to them, and useless to the Crown, After which durance he to Oxford came, Highly encourag'd by the Loyal Fame Of Suff'ring for the King, and had pretence To Royal Favour and Munificence, Conceiving he'd a Title to receive Much more than Bankrupt Majesty could give. So numbers boast the mighty Deeds they've done, In duty to their Country and the Throne, Who when advantage offers break their Troth, And only serve 'em to purloin from both. THE Lord Dunsmore's CHARACTER. By Nature rough, and like the Northern Wind, Boist'rous and too tempestuously inclin'd, Fierce and impatient in the doubtful Chase Of all things he desir'd to bring to pass; But wanted Temper rightly to pursue, And Judgment to obtain the End in view; Yet had an Int'rest, and enjoy'd a fair Repute with some who discontented were, And with such Persons had sufficient Pow'r, To raise their Fears and indispose 'em more; Nor did he want the Credit to appease And rectify their groundless Jealousies. In hopes of these good Services the Lord Was by his Sov'reign call'd to Council-Board: After some others, who deserv'd it less, At the same Table had an equal Place, But none could with more readiness perform His Part, or prove in all dispatch more warm Than Dunsmore; but sometimes his over Zeal Made what was well design'd succeed but ill. Yet tho' morose himself, no Noble Peer Could boast a Daughter more divinely Fair, Whose sweet angelick Temper, Shape, and Face, Charm'd young Southampton to her soft Embrace; A Match that did the Lady's Vertues sute, And to her Father added much repute. Thus, as the Crabtree-Stock, for humane use, If grafted well, does the best Fruit produce; So the stern Lord begot the charming Bride, Who bless'd that Loyal Peer Southampton's Side. THE Earl of Leicester's CHARACTER. In Books conversant, studiously inclin'd, And with good Learning had enrich'd his Mind, Was in the useful Mathematicks skill'd, And qualify'd to serve in Court or Field, Had been a Soldier in a Foreign Land, O'er a Dutch Regiment had born Command. Was after sent, his Credit to advance, Embassador to Denmark and to France; Yet rather prov'd, at last, what we may call A Speculative Man than Practical; One that from humane Councils thought to find More Certitude in Matters well design'd, Than the perplex'd Affairs or shallow Wit Of this uncertain World would e'er admit: By which unhappy Temper he was steer'd Upon those Rocks and Shelves he should have fear'd. When Strafford had resign'd his Head to please The Kingdom's and his own ill Enemies, Leic'ster, who with an Embassy was sent To France, by the joint Kindness and Consent Of King and Queen, was call'd from thence and made Regent of Ireland in the other's stead; But shortly after, thro' Misconduct, lost Th'Esteem of both, together with his Post, And was remanded back from Chester Port To Oxford, where the King then kept his Court, In order, as pretended, to receive Some fresh Instructions, e're he took his leave; But for some secret Reasons went not o'er At all to govern the Hibernian Shore; Yet with the King continu'd, but desir'd That his Advice might be no more requir'd; And tho' in Council oftentimes he sate, Would never meddle in Affairs of State, Which brought unjust Reproaches on his Head, And more Suspicions than he merited, For to his Sov'reign he was known to be A Man of Honour and Fidelity, But wanted Resolution to go through Those Storms which e'ery wise Man had in view; And to his stagg'ring Nature ow'd the whole Misfortunes that disquieted his Soul. So he that's to contend, and thinks too much Upon the Danger that he sees approach. Chills with cold Fear the Courage he should shew, And oft is crush'd by what the Bold subdue. A.D. 1640. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Sixteenth Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1640. This Spring, as an ill Omen of the cross Events, the King sustain'd a mighty Loss, By th'Death of Coventry, who kept the Seal Full sixteen Winters, unaccus'd of Ill. Finch, Lord-Chief-Justice of the Common-Pleas, Succeeding, who, as Clarendine agrees, Was not sufficient for a Trust so great, When such a Croud of Cares involv'd the State. For when a low'ring Storm hangs o'er the Realm, A skilful Pilot ought to steer the Helm. The Senate on the third of April join'd, And e'ery Face declar'd a joyful Mind, All jarring Parties hoping to receive Those Blessings which a Parliament might give. When they had sworn Allegiance to the Throne, And thro' their ancient Ceremonies run, Chose Sergeant Glanvil Speaker of the House Of Commons, with a Voice unanimous; The King, as usual, with an awful Grace, In the Lord's House assum'd his Royal Place, And in a Speech that well became a Throne, Gave them a Compliment, but soon had done, Leaving the new Lord-Keeper to declare What he desir'd his Parliament should hear, Who laid before the Houses all the base Proceedings of the crafty Scottish Race, Their large but false Professions to their Prince, The Treaty sign'd, their Insolencies since: Their impudent and treas'nable Address To the French King, for Succour in Distress; Told 'em His Majesty did not require Their Counsel in the Case, much less desire That they should interpose in that Affair, As Mediators, thro' their over-care; But that they should, with all convenient speed, Raise such Supplies to serve his present need, That might forthwith enabl'im under these High Provocations and Indignities, To vindicate his Honour by the force Of Arms, since there remain'd no other Course; And that the Progress by the Rebels made, Requir'd an Army not to be delay'd; And if they gave a quick dispatch to this, The King would grant 'em time for Grievances. But Strafford, who had been remanded o'er, From Ireland, by the King, not long before, Having obtain'd an Honour The Barony of Graby. of the Throne, Which Secretary Vane design'd his own, So great a Feud and Enmity arose Between them two, who always had been Foes, That whatsoever Service one advanc'd, The other, out of spight discountenanc'd. And Vane well knowing 'twas the Earl's desire To keep the King and Parliament intire, That no Debates or Ruffles might impede The Crown's Affairs at such a time of Need, Resolv'd, by over-acting, to obstruct The Bus'ness he was trusted to conduct; That when the Lords by too much Zeal and Haste, Had giv'n the House of Commons some Distaste, In rashly interposing their Advice, Betwixt the King and them, about Supplies; And after Hyde and Glanvile, by the Pains They'd taken in their pow'rful Eloquence, And by unanswerable Reasons brought The House into a Temper, as 'twas thought, Vane, by insisting on the King's Demand, In full, destroy'd the Bus'ness then in hand, Averring, that he knew His Majesty Would not accept their Gift, should they agree On any less proportion of Supplies, At such a Juncture, than twelve Subsidies, Settled pursuant to the King's Request, As in his Message he'd before exprest, When Vane himself well knew the Government With half the Sum had gladly been content, Which might have been obtain'd had he forborn Those Words which did the King so ill a turn. But this Extravagance so much inflam'd The House, and was so totally condemn'd, That tho' the King, in case they would submit To grant him such Supplies as requisite, Offer'd to drop all Title and Pretence To the Ship-Tax, that gave so great Offence, Yet nothing would divert 'em from their high Debates, which turn'd the Crown's Affairs awry, And to the Faction open'd such a Breach, That still grew wider upon e'ery Speech: Nor could the Loyal Party find a way To stop their Speed, they run so fast astray, Till the King finding that they chang'd their Course, Not for the better, but from bad to worse, And fearing in their Warmth they should agree To Vote down his Dependance Ship-Money, On May the fifth, by's Keeper, he dissolv'd The Senate, wishing they had ne'er been call'd; The Faction falsly charging all the Blame On Rev'rend Laud, tho' guiltless of the same; For Hamilton the Scot gave this untow'rd Advice, e're 'twas propos'd at Council-Board, That he the easier might pursue his own Advantages 'twixt Scotland and the Throne. The King thus disappointed and perplex'd, Scarce knew what Measures he should fix on next, That might forthwith enabl'im to proceed In raising Forces with convenient speed, For nothing at this Juncture could be done Without an Army to secure the Throne: Scotland were now preparing to invade The Kingdom, by its Factious-self betray'd, The City-Mob stir'd up to shew their spight By John Lilburn who fix'd a Paper upon Change to that purpose. To Laud, and rifle Lambeth-House by Night, Who having notice, was with Arms prepar'd Against they came, to stand upon his Guard, That tho' Five-hundred made a rash attack, They prov'd successless and were beaten back; One taken, after try'd for the Offence, Convicted, hang'd and quarter'd for his Pains. The King in haste to push his Bus'ness on, Sent to the Loyal City for a Loan, But they'd the Grace most falsly to pretend, That wanting Trade they were too poor to lend, Altho' 'twas known they never flourish'd more In Commerce, or of Coin, had greater Store, And would have rais'd a heap of Treasure soon, To have disserv'd, tho' not to serve the Crown. However, Majesty without their Aid, A timely shift among the Gentry made, Who rais'd the King a sutable Supply, Becoming their Estates and Quality, Which, with the Clergy's kind Benevolence, Granted in Convocation to their Prince; Together with the sev'ral Troops and Bands, Rais'd in all Shires, by such as held their Lands In Capite, soon furnish'd a compleat And Loyal Army, for the Purpose fit; O'er which new Force, the General Command Was given to the Earl Northumberland; Strafford ambitious of the next great Post, Was made Lieutenant-Gen'ral of the Host; Lord Conway favour'd with the third Degree Of Martial Honour, o'er the Cavalry: But e're they mov'd Northumberland fell sick, And grew, some think, so politickly weak, That when he should have march'd he kept his Bed, And Royal Charles himself the Army led; Conway advancing with the Van some Days Before the King was in a readiness, Who staid at Oatlands till the pregnant Queen Had with a further Offspring Prince Henry born in July 20. blest his Reign. The King by this time had Intelligence, That the Scotch Army were advanc'd to Dunce, And therefore sent fresh Orders to his Van, To expedite their March, that they might gain Newcastle; but the King, before he got To York, receiv'd Advice, that Rebel Scot, Old Lesly, with his hardy Northern Breed Of scabby Loons, had pass'd the River Tweed. Thus, ent'ring England, terrify'd those Parts, And fill'd with sudden Fear the Peoples Hearts, That now fresh Orders were to Conway sent, For him to use his utmost to prevent The Scots advance, until the King had join'd His Lordship with the Force that march'd behind. As soon as Conway had his Orders read He call'd a Council, who, at length, agreed To keep the Pass of Newborn upon Tine, And by that means to baulk the Scots Design, Who, as they rightly judg'd, were marching on, In order to possess Newcastle Town; Accordingly the Lord drew up his Force, Consisting of Twelve-hundred able Horse, And Foot Three-thousand, hoping to secure The Newborn Pass against the Scottish Pow'r. But Lesly in the Night, by Darkness hid, Brought down his Army to the River-side, And under the close cover of a few Convenient Shrubs, that near the Water grew, Planted, before Aurora could advance Her dawn, nine Pieces of his Ordinance; And in the Morning did to Conway send A Letter, by a Trumpet, which contain'd An humble Suit, that he and all his Force Might, without Interuption, have recourse To their good King, in order to submit Their Scotch Petition at his Royal Feet. Conway replying, That in such a case He'd let a few, but not an Army pass. Upon which Answer Lesly gave the Word For his Van-Guard, Three-hundred Horse, to Ford The River, but the English, from behind A Breast-work, gave the Rebels so unkind A Welcome, that they could not stand their Fire, Which was so fierce it forc'd them to retire: But when the crafty Scots began to play Their Cannon which behind the Bushes lay, The English Foot were all so terrify'd, That they no longer could their Works abide, But left their Station, threw their Musquets down, And in Confusion from their Duty run. The Northern Horse inspir'd with this Success, Plung'd thro' the Tine, and gain'd a Landing-place, Tho' Conway's Troops a smart Resistance made, Till over-power'd with Numbers, then they fled, And, without rally'ng let the Scots possess Newcastle, to all Englishmens Disgrace, Conway incurring universal Blame, Tho' never call'd to Justice for the same; For the King's Lenity was always such, He spar'd to punish and believ'd too much. The Scots had all this while, by cunning Means, Preserv'd a treacherous Intelligence With many Factious Lords, too near the Throne, Who made the King's Designs to Scotland known, Also with their Fanatick London Friends, Who hop'd they now should gain their Pious Ends; And these nefarious Workings underhand, Gave the Scots Courage to invade the Land. And after, in a Pamphlet that was read In open Field, at their own Army's Head, T'averr, that they had one and all agreed, No more to cross those watry Bounds the Tweed, Till the reform'd true Church, by which they meant Their own, obtain'd a lawful Settlement In both the Kingdoms, which audacious Piece Was printed and dispers'd abroad to please Their Friends, the London Saints, well knowing that Was what the Faction wanted to be at, Declaring also, they were firmly bent To see those Persons brought to Punishment, Whose Pow'r had kindled that unhappy Flame, To their great Grief, betwixt the King and them, Charging their whole Misfortunes on the Pride Of Laud, and all the Prelacy beside; Together with that wise and Loyal Peer, Strafford, whose Counsels they had cause to fear, Knowing he was the surest prop of State, And therefore made the Object of their Hate: Nor did the Scots forbear, when they'd command Of Durham County and Northumberland, Contrary to their Promises, to lay A Tax of near Nine-hundred Eight-hundred and fifty Pounds. Pounds a Day Upon those Districts, which was more than all Their Kingdom could have paid in general. The King b'ing now at York, perceiv'd too late, The Treach'ry and Corruption in the State, And that he daily was betray'd by those Who fawn'd at Court, but sided with his Foes; Therefore, amidst these Conflicts, summon'd all The Lords into a Council-General, At York, that in this Storm of Troubles there, They might advise their Sov'reign how to steer. Which Resolution did not please the Scots, Nor those wh'abetted their Rebellious Plots, Fearing this wise Assembly might prevent The speedy Calling a new Parliament, Whereby the Rebels and their English Friends, Propos'd to bring about their secret Ends; Therefore some Lords, deceitful to the Throne, With other Peers they had prevail'd upon, Fram'd a Petition to the King, to please The Faction, op'ning many Grievances, And praying that His Majesty would call, Without delay, a Parliament, that all The Counsellors and Authors of those great And growing Mischiefs that inflam'd the State, Might be forthwith, for their Offences, try'd, And justly punish'd, as the Laws provide. Another, also, to the same intent, Was from the factious Part of London sent, With whom the Scots proceeded Hand-in-hand, And, like their Friends, Petition'd and Complain'd, How ill they had been us'd, how well they meant, And, therefore, humbly pray'd a Parliament Might soon be call'd, in order to redress Their Wrongs, and settle both the Lands in Peace. The summon'd Lords were now at York conven'd September 24., To whom the King declar'd, He did intend To call a Senate of his own accord, That in November next, upon the third, Should meet, and therefore only now desir'd To move two Points, which their Advice requir'd, The first, What Answer would become the Throne, To the Rebellious Scots Petition? And secondly, What Methods would be best To put in present Practise to subsist The Army, till a Parliament could raise Supplies by their accustomary ways. With these two Points His Majesty laid down, Th'assembl'd Lords, without delay, went on; As to the Scots, concluding, that to treat Was of all means most safe and most discreet; And for the Army, they assur'd the Throne, They'd mediate with London for a Loan. These Resolutions with the King prevail'd, And made him to a second Treaty yield, That to the Scots a Message soon was sent, To let 'em know, His Majesty's intent Was by the best and tender'st Means he cou'd, To heal the Breach without expence of Blood, York being by the King appointed, where Both Sides were to debate the Grand Affair: But Strafford's Earl Commanding for the Crown, The Army Quarter'd chiefly in that Town, And the unhappy Peer being one of those The Scots had rank'd i'th' number of their Foes, They urg'd their Agents could not be secure Within that great Incendiary's Pow'r, Against whose Evil Practises they meant, When time should serve, to make a just Complaint, Desiring the Commissioners might meet At Rippon, where with safety they might treat. To which the King submitted, tho' 'twas base Presumption in the Scots to name the Place. But Pride, which makes Men Rebels, takes away All Rev'rence to those Pow'rs they should obey. Accordingly both Sides to Rippon sent Commissioners For the King, the Earls of Hertford, Bedford, Pembroke, Salisbury, Essex, Holland, Bristol, and Berkshire; the Lords Mandevile, Wharton, Dunsmore, Brook, Savile, Paulet, Howard of Escrick, (the Lord Say being sick.) For the Scots, the Lord Lowden, lately set at liberty from the Tower by the King, two or three Gentlemen and Citizens, and Alexander Henderson, their Factious Metropolitan., in order to prevent The Bloodshed that must happen, lest some Means Were found to pacify the Difference, Which to the Scots advantage soon was done, After the King had been prevail'd upon To send such Persons as were more in Fee With Scotland than His Royal Majesty. So that such gen'ral Matters were agreed At Rippon as might serve the present Need, And the Particulars from thence refer'd To London, as the Rebel-Scots desir'd, England submitting tamely to provide For the Scotch Host, till Peace was ratify'd, Tho' backward to supply the Needy Throne With Sums sufficient to maintain their own. So debauch'd Men, inur'd to wicked Lives, Prove kinder to their Harlots than their Wives. In the ninth Month Nov.3. the Parliament begun, And a kind Speech was made 'em from the Throne, Hoping at such a time they'd lay aside All Prejudice, and speedily provide For England's safety, and consult of Means Whereby the Rebels might be driven hence; The King declaring that he would redress, Forthwith, their just Complaints and Grievances, That nothing should be left undone that might Advance his Kingdom to a glorious height, Leaving the Keeper to enlarge upon The Motives of the Scotch Invasion. But all the Eloquence that both could use, Prevail'd so little with the Factious House, That they reviv'd and rais'd up e'ery thing Which could be thought ingrateful to the King; And at the Instance of some envious Peers, Together with the Scotch Commissioners, Voted that an Impeachment should be made Against the Earl of Strafford, and be laid For the high Crime of Treason 'gainst the Crown; Which Spite they shew'd to welcome him to Town, Who, little dreaming of their hasty Work, Was just return'd, with the King's leave, from York, Accordingly officious Pym was sent T'impeach him to the Lords in Parliament, Praying from thence he might sequestred be Also committed into Custody; Adding, the Articles of his Offence Should be exhibited a few Days hence. Next Day, instead of chasing out the Scots, They shew'd 'em so much Favour in their Votes, That they resolv'd, for Expedition, To raise a Hundred Thousand Pounds by Loan. That both the Armies might alike subsist, Till Peace was made, that both might be dismiss'd. And now the City could their Bags unbind, Who, to assist the Throne no Wealth could find. But Faction never wanted a support, When London was too pow'rful for the Court. The Commons soon, according to their Word, Sent up their Articles against the Lord They had Impeach'd, who now committed stood, Beneath the Care of him that bore the Rod Usher of the Black-Rod., Tho' all their tedious and malicious Charge, Extreamly spiteful and confus'dly large, Did not amount, by any Statute known, In any part, to Treason 'gainst the Throne; Yet by hard Means, ignoble and severe, They reach'd his Head, as will in Place appear. For when the Wicked fill the Judgment-seat, And Reason must to Prejudice submit, What is not Just will be accounted fit. Nor did their furious Heat extend alone To Strafford, but to all who'd serv'd the Throne, Forcing, by their Proceedings, which were thought, By the King's Friends so dangerously hot, The Keeper Finch, and Windebank Secretary of State. to fly The Land, foreseeing their Destruction nigh, Possess'd the Judges with a pannick Fear, And made 'em shake their Beards at Westminster, Threat'ning they would a Charge of Treason draw 'Gainst all who'd warranted the King by Law Might Levy Money to defend the Land, Of his own Pow'r, when Danger was at hand. To please the Scots, committed to the Tow'r Archbishop Laud, and frighten'd many more, O'er whom they kept an awe, that none might dare To thwart 'em in the Course they meant to steer, Calling in Question all that they could make Appear, by Art and factious Malice, black, That, by pretending to reform and mend, They might subvert the Throne and gain their End. Thus Faction, always, by the Faults they find, Obscure their own Designs that lurk behind. But when they've gain'd the Pow'r, the Nation sees, Too late, her own approaching Miseries. The End of the Sixteenth Year. THE Earl of Strafford's CHARACTER. Wise, Loyal, truly Noble, but Austere, A Foe to Flatt'ry and the Flatterer. His Presence awful and his Looks Serene, Adapted to the Soul that lodg'd within, As if his Face by Nature was design'd An Index to the Vertues of his Mind. Nor did his Merit fail to raise him high, And fix him in the Heart of Majesty, Who, finding his Abilities so great In all Affairs and Mysteries of State, Own'd to the World, a Prince might rather fear, Than be asham'd to trust so wise a Peer. Ireland he govern'd, and reform'd the same, When gross Disorders did that Isle inflame, Tho' some who were in lofty Stations there, Had cause to think his Carriage too severe. Nor did he want, as Fav'rites seldom do, Ill Enemies at Court, and that he knew, Such Rivals who were vex'd to see him tow'r So high, and grew uneasy at his Pow'r, Improving by the utmost Arts they cou'd, That Prejudice which ended in his Blood. When Faction did too Insolent appear, The King recall'd him home to manage here, Where he the Helm with trusty Caution steer'd, Honour'd by good Men, and by Traytors fear'd; Who justly thought him now the chief support, And greatest Bulwark that secur'd the Court Against those Mischiefs they were driving on, In order to subvert the Church and Throne; Therefore resolv'd to propagate their Ends, By forcing from the King the best of Friends; Accordingly the Factious Tribe preferr'd A black'ning Scroll against the guiltless Lord; Who, by the Malice of that Rebel Pym, And thirsty Spitfires that concurr'd with him, Was basely worry'd 'twixt the House of Peers, And his invet'rate Foes the Commoners; Both at that time being over-rul'd and mov'd By that curs'd Torrent, which so fatal prov'd To the unhappy Earl, tho' none could swim With greater Art against the boist'rous Stream; Yet all his skilful Struggles were imploy'd In vain, against the rude impetuous Tide, That tir'd, at length, with the Defence he made, He to the foaming Billows bow'd his Head; Begging the Sov'reign Ruler of the Throne, To sacrifice his Life to save his own, Who wanting no Resentments of his Case, With great Reluctance sign'd his dreadful Pass; Whilst fickle angry Earl of Holland, Pym and Sir Harry Vane, the Elder. Vane, Pursu'd the Hero to his last Amen. Thus the most Just, in a divided State, Where Faction reigns, are most expos'd to Fate; For when her Brood above the Sov'reign climbs, Fidelity is deem'd the worst of Crimes. THE Marquis of Hertford's CHARACTER His Int'rest, Honour, and his Fortune great, His Vertues equal to his large Estate, His Courage active, permanent and clear; In Danger insusceptible of Fear, With Books conversant, living much at home, Skill'd in the Languages of Greece and Rome; Rural Retirement from the Court he lov'd, And wisely took that Course he most approv'd, Car'd not for the fatigue of State-Affairs, But liv'd in Splendor, free from Courtly Cares, Among his Country Neighbours, and enjoy'd That Ease which more ambitious Minds avoid, By strugling to advance their Wealth and Pow'r At Court, where Hertford never strove to tow'r: Nor was the prudent Marquis, by the Throne, At first much countenanc'd or look'd upon, Because his Converse chiefly was with those Well known to be the Crown's audacious Foes, But had the Honour, when he once discern'd Their Violence, and their base Endeavours learn'd, To quit their factious Company betimes, Before he shar'd the Slander of their Crimes; And from the first of that Long-Parliament, That did alike from God and King dissent, Ne'er step'd awry, or could by Art be brought To join in one dishonourable Vote Against his Sov'reign Lord, or in the Case Of injur'd Strafford, lab'ring in Distress, Which reconcil'd his Master in the End, To think him a true Subject and a Friend, Was then appointed by the Sov'reign Pow'r, To be the Prince of Wales's Governour, Which in those dark unhappy Times was known To be a signal Service to the Throne; He also rais'd an Army in the West, To join the King, when by his Foes opprest; Did mighty Feats with but a slender Force, Consisting of few Foot and fewer Horse, Aw'd Bedford's Earl, and kept him at a stand, With a stout Army under his Command; Kept Sherborne-Castle, and maintain'd the Town, Whilst t'other with superior Force look'd on, Provok'd the Earl, by Challenge, to engage At Sword, but he refus'd to stand his Rage; And after he some Days and Nights had spent In Service of his Lords the Parliament, With a large Army on a rising Ground, Safe from the danger of a Gunshot Wound, He sent to treat with Hertford, and desire He and his Forces would in Peace retire, And by that means avoid the crying Guilt Of Christian Blood, that might perhaps be spilt. To which Request the Noble Marquis said, By their own Counsels they were thither led, And therefore might get off what way they cou'd. Which prudent Answer Bedford understood As a bold Threat, and drew his Army off, A dozen Miles, to make themselves more safe, Leaving the Marquis and his Troops, at most, Not one to ten, compar'd with t'other Host, In Sherborne-Town, for many Weeks, without The least Attempt, thro' Fear, to force 'em out, Till he, at length, had Reasons to withdraw His handful, that had kept the Earl in awe; For want of Strength was afterwards opprest, Cross'd into Wales, return'd into the West, There join'd Prince Maurice and the Cornish Foot, Took many Towns, put Waller to the Rout, Did sundry other Actions of Renown, To save his Country and to serve the Crown. Of Royal Cares did to the End partake, And rush'd thro' Perils for his Master's sake. Nor was he only to the bloody Hour, A faithful Servant to the Sov'reign Pow'r, But when the Lifeless Martyr bleeding lay, Was of the Four that beg'd the Royal Clay, And full of undissembl'd Grief convey'd The sacred Corps to th'Mansions of the Dead, Dying himself e're Providence restor'd The punish'd Kingdom to the rightful Lord, Leaving a Mem'ry that preserves a place With those enroll'd on Monumental Brass, Too deep for Time or Malice to deface. Thus shall the Actions of the Just and Brave, Survive their Clay, and flourish o'er the Grave, Whilst Rebels, who delight in Royal Blood, Stink, when they're nam'd, i'th' Nostrils of the Good. THE Lord Savil's CHARACTER Adorn'd with Learning and sufficient Wit, But render'd almost useless by Deceit, Was of a restless and aspiring Mind, To tricking Craft, and Falsity inclin'd, Not worthy to be trusted by the Throne, Or in Affairs of Weight rely'd upon. Much Malice he by Instinct had deriv'd, Against unhappy Strafford, who had liv'd At strife with Savil's Father, born him down By such hard Usage as inflam'd the Son, And made him forward to engage with all Those factious Furies who conspir'd his Fall; Yet by the Favour of the Sov'reign Pow'r, Was call'd to be a Privy-Counsellor; Then made, by the kind Bounty of his Prince, Comptroller of the Houshold, and from thence Prefer'd to be the Treas'rer of the same, So cunningly he plaid his treach'rous Game; For 'twas by his Contrivance and his Plots, That England was invaded by the Scots, He having sent an Invitation sign'd With Names of Peers, as if the Lords had join'd To call 'em in, when he had us'd so foul And base a Practise as to forge the whole. Which Treason, after it had taken Root, And to a dang'rous Issue had been brought, With seeming Terror in his trait'rous Breast, Was to his injur'd Sovereign confess'd; With Vows and Protestations to attone, By future Service, for the Ills he'd done; Gaining a Pardon for his past Offence, And Place aforesaid, as a recompence For his discov'ry, tho' it prov'd too late To stop the Treason, or to serve the State. Thus fading Princes, oft to their Reproach, Neglect their Friends, and favour Foes too much. Nor could the King more Benefit propose, By all the Treach'ry Savil could disclose, Than barely knowing some beyond the reach Of Punishment had made a faithless Breach Of their Allegiance, and that many more Were guilty, not suspected False before. When to the North the Monarch made his way, Where the Lord's Fortune and his Int'rest lay, The Reputation of the treach'rous Peer Was so declin'd among the Gentry there, That no Well-wishers to the King's Affairs Would with the Janus Favourite converse. And after Majesty from York set forth, And left Newcastle to command the North, The Earl had so much Reason to distrust The Lord, and think him to the Crown unjust, That he confin'd him for a time, and then Sent him to Oxford to his Sovereign, Where he so purg'd himself of all Offence, That he preserv'd the Favour of his Prince; But in the close behav'd himself so ill, And with the King did so unfairly deal, That Royal Goodness thrust him from his Place, With open irretrievable Disgrace, Committed him to Prison, where he lay Despis'd by all that did their Prince obey. And when discharg'd, was ne'er admitted more To th'Presence of the King he'd wrong'd before, But liv'd to mourn his Folly, curse his Birth, Blam'd by all Sides, and scorn'd by Men of worth. Errors in Judgment may sometimes dispose A Man to favour an unrighteous Cause, But that unconstant Wretch who turns all Ways, And still is False, must be by Nature base: Such impious Traytors seldom fail to meet Rewards as shameful as their vile Deceit. THE Lord Brook's CHARACTER Long had he tug'd at the Fanatick Oar, Against the lawful Stream of Sov'reign Pow'r, And strenuously labour'd with Delight, To screw up Faction to its utmost height; Tho' some alledge, his Zeal was not supply'd With any Malice, or inflam'd with Pride, But that 'twas owing to the bad Effects Of poyson'd and corrupted Intellects, Having been early from the Church misled, Or from the Cradle in Dissention bred: But let his Factious Tenets have their rise From Education, Pride, or Prejudice, Yet all the three, concenter'd in his Breast, Could not excite, or urge him to detest, With more abhorrence, both the Church and State; As if his sowre Aversion was innate. Like theirs who swoon when they a Cat behold, Or at the sight of Cheese grow Pale and Cold; Yet cannot, if they're ask'd the Cause, declare One Reason for the great Dislike they bear. Nor did he only labour to Foment The Feud 'twixt Faction and the Government, But when it burst into a Civil Flame, Became an active Rebel in the same, Was made their Idol-Gen'ral, and ador'd As the Saints only Patriarchal Lord, Their Rock, their Hope, the Shield of their Defence, The Prop of all their future Confidence; Till in the Town of Litchfield, as he sat In his own Chamber, he receiv'd a Shot I'th' Eye, from some good Marks-man, in the close, Which sent the Hero to his last Repose, Having that Morning, with an impious Tongue, Implor'd good Heav'n, that if his Cause was wrong, He might be instantly cut off, which Pray'r The God of Justice was dispos'd to hear, And answer'd the Enthusion's bold Request, That the just Judgment might reclaim the rest, But that which also made his Death to all Th'Inhabitants still more remarkable, Was, that it happen'd on a certain Day That's call'd St. Chad's, which, as Historians say, Derives its ancient venerable Name From a good Bishop, noted by the same, Who liv'd long since, as old Records agree, In the first Ages of Christianity, And that the Church at Litchfield, in the close, Besieg'd by Brook and her Rebellious Foes, When first erected, in the Times of Yore, Was Christen'd by the Name that Bishop bore; Which does a further Argument advance, To prove his Death a Judgment, not a Chance; Yet still the Rebels, destitute of Grace, Pursu'd the Siege and took the Holy Place. For when the Heart's corrupted, and the sence Of man confirm'd in a wrong Confidence, Nothing but the constraint of Heav'n can force The Mind, for better, to forsake the worse. The Character of the short Parliament, begun April 3. and dissolv'd May 5. 1640. The temper of both Houses, when they met, Stood well inclin'd to serve the Royal State, And seem'd unfeignedly dispos'd to grant An Aid sufficient for the Publick Want, Till Vane Sir Harry the Father, then Secretary of State., through Malice to that Fav'rite Peer, Wise Strafford, trusted by the King to steer The Throne's Affairs, such wilful Errors made, That rais'd up Heats too pow'rful to be laid, And gave the stiff-neck'd Party so much play, That Faction gain'd new Converts e'ery Day, And by their artful flagrant Speeches wrought Upon the wav'ring Commons, till such hot Divisions fill'd the House, that they began T'insult, and not supply their Sovereign; Also to quarrel with the Lords about A trifling Privilege not worth dispute, Which, at another time, they would have pass'd, Without the least Resentment or Distast. But Vane insisting on no less Supplies, Than a full Grant of twice six Subsidies, When he was timely caution'd to abate, In case his first Demands were thought too great, So chang'd the hopeful Temper of the House, And gave to Pym and Hambden such a loose, That the King's Friends could by no means restore The Commons to the Bent they shew'd before, Which so provok'd the King, that he dissolv'd The Senate, tho' in Cares and Doubts involv'd, His Coffers at an ebb, his Credit sunk, And Scotland by intemp'rate Zeal made drunk. But when he heard the Commons were inclin'd To serve his Ends, till Vane had chang'd their Mind, He then began to heartily repent The Dissolution of his Parliament; And was desirous, could it have been done, To've call'd 'em back by Proclamation; But those he trusted most, alas, could find No Precedent pursuant to his Mind, That both the King and People seem'd to grieve At such a rash Misconduct, past retrieve, His Majesty disowning his Consent To Secretary Vane's Mismanagement, And for his treach'rous and revengeful Ills, Remov'd him, in his Anger, from the Seals. Thus Kings, who trust to Ministers of State, Oft suffer by the Quarrels of the Great. A.D. 1641. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1641. The Factious Managers in Strafford's Case His Tryal began March 22. ended April 13., To please the Scots, proceeded now apace, And tho' he made so Noble a Defence, That clear'd, to all good Men, his Innocence, And satisfy'd his Royal Master's Breast, That he was undeservedly oppress'd; Yet when there was no Law that made his Crimes High-Treason, the Corruption of the Times Was such, his Foes attainted him by Bill, And scandaliz'd their Pow'r to have their Will, Adding a Clause expresly to prevent The same remaining as a Precedent; By which the Senate evidently blam'd Their own Proceedings, and their Act condemn'd. So he that seeks Revenge, o'er-run with Spleen, First gives the Stab, and then repents the Sin. The King, whose Mercy overpoiz'd his Pow'r, Did all he could to make the Earl secure; But the rude Rabble starting from their Holes, Encourag'd by the Commons, flow'd in Shoals Around the Palace, where they cry'd aloud For speedy Justice, meaning Strafford's Blood, That Royal Goodness had no room to save The Earl, tho' guiltless, from the hasty Grave, Unless he'd been regardless of his Throne, And rescu'd him from ruin by his own; Therefore the King, amidst these Cares and Fears, Aw'd by the Factious Commons and the Peers, And being also by the Earl implor'd, For Royal Safety, sign'd what he abhor'd. At the same time the Senate did exact That fatal and unprecedented Act, Which the King pass'd, impow'ring them to sit As long hereafter as themselves thought fit. If common Danger, or the bare mistrust Thereof could make the Senate's rashness just, The same must be allow'd as good a Plea For all the weaker Acts of Majesty. In May the 12th. the Hero fell a Sacrifice To his base Scotch revengeful Enemies, Who, if his good Advice had been pursu'd, Had sav'd his own and many Thousands Blood, By beating back those false rebellious Foes, Without a Treaty, by the dint of Blows, Having in Durham plainly shew'd the Throne, In one Exploit, it might have soon been done, Where a small Party of the English Horse, Sent by the Earl, had routed twice the Force, Which so inflam'd the Scots, that he should shew Their Weakness when a Treaty was in view, That they could ne'er forgive him the Offence, But heighten'd their Revenge the more from thence, Which had its fatal rise some time before, When th'Earl in Ireland exercis'd his Pow'r, Where he proclaim'd them Rebels as they were, Before the King thought fit to do it here. So common Whores, who glory in their shame, Altho' they hug the Sin, yet hate the Name. The Scots and Managers in Parliament, Thus having gain'd with Ease this mighty Point, The Loyal Party were so aw'd thereby, That none durst say the Faction trod awry, Who now no stormy Opposition fear'd, But, hoisting up their Topsails, smoothly steer'd, With a full Gale tow'rds their intended Port, Fearing no Rocks or Bulwarks of the Court, Abolish'd the Star-Chamber by consent O'th' King, tho' settl'd first by Parliament, Pull'd down the High-Commission, and repeal'd The Statute's Clause by which it had been held; In both which Courts their Friends had been chastis'd, For their ill Talents basely exercis'd, Which made 'em much more hasty to redress Such awful arbitrary Grievances, That beyond Bounds their factious Tongues might run, And with less danger vilify the Throne. The Ship-Money they also render'd void, And all Proceedings thereupon destroy'd; Five of the Judges Bramston, Trevor, Weston, Davenport, Crawly. who had frankly sign'd Opinions grateful to the Royal Mind, Were of high Crimes impeach'd, tho' all indeed, As well as they, had in the same agreed; And that the Twelve might be the more amus'd, And aw'd, a sixth Barkly. of Treason was accus'd, Tho' they'd the Temper in their Heat to stop Proceedings, and to let the Matter drop, Designing only by the Warmth they'd shown, To fright 'em from adhering to the Throne. The Right of Tunnage, which the English Throne Had long enjoy'd, they wrested from the Crown. Also prevail'd upon the King to give The Market-Branch of his Prerogative, And to discharge Knight-Service, which in War Was due by Law unto the Sov'reign Pow'r, Engag'd him to relinquish all pretence Of pressing Soldiers for the Land's defence, And to disclaim an old peculiar Propriety in making Gunpowder; Brought in an impious Bill to lay aside The Bishops Votes, but that the Lords deny'd. However, in Six Months, or little more, They rob'd the King of half his Royal Pow'r. The Treaty now b'ing finish'd 'twixt the Throne And those that manag'd the Rebellion, A heavy Poll-Tax thro' the Land was laid, That both the Armies might with speed be paid. And as a Bounty to the Scots alone, For the good Publick Service they had done, Three-hundred-thousand Pounds the Senate thought The smallest Boon they could in Conscience Vote, Which by an Act they did secure beside Their Pay, to satiate their Rebellious Pride; One-hundred-thousand to be paid in June Come Twelve-month, and the rest when Sol had run Two annual Courses from the Date assign'd For the first Payment, by their over-kind And gen'rous Friends the Parliament, who shew'd Their Temper in their Factious Gratitude. For none but Rebels sure would whet the Swords Of Rebels, with such undeserv'd Rewards. When thus the Scots and Faction here had gain'd Their Ends, both Sides their Armies did disband August the 6th., And four Days after Royal Charles begun His Progress tow'rds his Scotch Dominion, Where the false Loons, who had but just withdrawn Themselves from Treach'ry and Rebellion, Receiv'd their King with such a loud excess Of Joy, as if they truly meant no less. Nor did forgiving Majesty neglect To grant 'em more than they could well expect, Hoping by such kind Methods to restore Their due Obedience to the Sov'reign Pow'r, Ratify'd all the Acts that had been done By their Assembly 'gainst the Church and Throne, Wherein they had abolish'd and made null All Jurisdict' and Pow'r Episcopal, Settling the Ruins of the Church upon The King and his Successors to the Throne. They also gain'd His Majesty's assent T'invest the Council nam'd by Parliament, In the King's Absence, with the free and full Unbounded Exercise of Sov'reign Rule; And that their Senate should have Pow'r to meet, Upon a certain Day prefix'd and set, Triennially, all which was to be done Without a Call or Summons from the Crown: The King conferring e'ery Place of Trust On those who'd been most treach'rous and unjust, Reserving only to himself the Grant Of Honours, but no share of Government, Having bestow'd the sacred Spoils among Their craving Nobles, that insatiate Throng, Proving most kind and bountiful to those Who were most able to be dang'rous Foes; Conferring Honous on the Lord Argyle, Lesly, and his Lieutenant-General, And other Northern Gentry, who had been Most active in the late rebellious Scene; All humbly making, in return to these Concessions, large and loyal Promises, Which e'ery one, like true born Scots, took care To break, when Opportunity stood fair. Nor is it less than Justice to the Great, Who slight their Friends and favour those they Hate. When Lucifer, the first that e'er rebell'd, Led his wing'd Troops into the boundless Field, Heav'n no such Mercy to the Rebels shew'd, But damn'd 'em for their curs'd Ingratitude, That God's Vicegerents might Example take, And punish those who their Allegiance break. For 'tis a shameful Refuge to cashire Our Friends, and hug our Enemies in fear. During this Progress fatal News came o'er To the King's Ear, from the Hibernian Shore, That all the Popish Natives had begun A bold and barbarous Rebellion, Wherein they daily murder'd in their Rage, Without regard to either Sex or Age, The Protestants, by heaps, who wanting Pow'r To make defence, lay welt'ring in their Gore. And tho' Conally a discov'ry made To th'Judges how the black Design was laid, The Night before the Day they were to rise October 23. And perpetrate their bloody Villanies, Yet were they render'd able, by so short A Warning, to prevent but little hurt; Dublin itself b'ing harrass'd to secure The Town and Castle from the Rebels Pow'r, The latter b'ing stor'd with Arms, from whence The Protestants got Weapons of Defence; And when thus arm'd did into Bodies draw Themselves, and kept the Catholicks in awe; But in all Places of the Land beside, They rang'd, burnt Villages, whole Crouds destroy'd And in a Month Two-hundred-thousand kill'd, Making their boggy Isle one bloody Field; B'ing first encourag'd, as Records agree, By Scotland, to attempt this Massacre, The Loons beginning a Rebellion there, To propagate their Kirk by open War; And having, by that Means, recover'd all They wanted from the Church-Episcopal, The Papists thought they might as justly free The Church of Rome from English Tyranny, And being fed by Priests with flatt'ring hope, Took the like Measures to restore the Pope. For if Saint Andrew any Right can claim To vile Rebellion, and incur no Blame, Saint Patrick, by my Shoul, may plead the same. The King, in Scotland, gave up this Affair Of Ireland, to his English Senate's Care, Who sent both Men and Money with what speed They could, to serve that Kingdom in its need, The Council there b'ing diligent the while, In all things for the safety of the Isle, And, with what Forces they could raise, withstood The Rebels, who had bath'd in English Blood. For when Religion Arms, the Heart grows hard, And Cruelty's most sinful if it's spar'd. The King, who'd, in a manner, made a Deed Of Gift, of all his Pow'r beyond the Tweed, From Scotland now return'd The latter-end of November., and passing through His Loyal City, they desir'd to shew Their Love and Duty in a splendid Feast They'd made to entertain the Royal Guest; Nor did they only Banquet him, but wait Upon his Person to his Palace-Gate. Which Kindness was return'd at Hampton-Court, In costly Meats and Wines of e'ery sort; The King conferring Honours upon some, And when he'd done dispatch'd the Muckworms home. Th'invet'rate Commons now, to shew their bent, To Hampton-Court a foul Remonstrance sent Upon the first of December., Wherein they open'd all that had been done Amiss since the King's coming to the Crown. To which they also had prefix'd a base Petition, full of equal Bitterness, Praying the King would with the House consent, The Bishops should not Vote in Parliament, And that about him none might be employ'd, But such in whom the Senate might confide; And that he would not alienate the Lands In Ireland, that should fall into his hands By the Rebellion, promising their Care Should not be wanting to support the War, In order to suppress the Troubles there. To all these Points, for which they humbly pray'd, The King a smooth evasive Answer made, Which in no measure satisfy'd the House, But made them more impatient and morose; That tho' His Majesty forbid the same, They printed their Remonstrance to inflame The Croud, and having pass'd a Bill that none In Orders should have Jurisdiction In Temporal Affairs, to which the Peers Unanimously seeming much averse, The factious City furnish'd out a rude And mischievous undaunted Multitude, Who, fearless, did in daring Throngs repair To the Old Palace-Yard at Westminster, Against the Bishops us'd opprobrious Words, Insulting also many Temp'ral Lords, Stopping at Whitehall-Gate, as back they came, Crying, No Porter's Lodge should hinder them From speaking with the King, but would be free, At all times to approach His Majesty. Yet when the Upper-House desir'd the Low'r To join against this rude tumultuous Pow'r, In such a Declaration as might put A speedy End to the unlawful Rout, Pym, their chief Oracle, cry'd, God forbid The Commons should unwarily proceed, In any way to hinder or deter The People from discov'ring their desire; A freedom God had trusted in their hands, In order to obtain their just Demands. And when the neighb'ring Justices took care To raise the Constables at Westminster, With a large Watch, pursuant to a Writ The Lords had issued to asswage this Heat, The House of Commons voted it a Breach Of Privilege to set forth such a Watch, Commanded all the Constables before The House, and charg'd 'em they should Ward no more; And did a Justice to the Tow'r commit, For acting with Obedience to the Writ, Yet they themselves, who'd rais'd the wicked Herd, Petition'd that their House might have a Guard Under Command of the Earl of Essex. Against Malignants, who, they said, were bent To offer Violence to the Parliament. Thus crafty Faction always seem to dread Plots counter to the deep Designs they've laid, And all the Ills they've done, or mean to do, They charge on those whose ruin they pursue. The King, altho' he modestly deny'd Their base Petition, solemnly reply'd, He'd take all Measures that became his Throne, To make their Safety equal with his own. During the time His Majesty remain'd At Edenburgh, he by some means had gain'd Intelligence of sev'ral who had made The Scot's an Invitation to invade The Kingdom, of which number five were then Among the Commons, busy leading Men; Besides Lord. Kimbolton of the Upper-house, Who also did the factious Cause espouse. Against these Six, by Order of the Throne, A Charge Of High-Treason. was by the King's Attorney drawn; And thereupon a proper Message sent To th'Lower-house, in order to acquaint The Commons, that His Sacred Majesty Desir'd such Members into Custody, B'ing equally accus'd of that Offence, High-Treason, on substantial Evidence; But the proud House, with Faction over-run, Slighting th'unwelcome Message from the Throne, Voted, if any Person should presume, Without an Order of the House, to come To any Member, and attempt to take His Person, that he might Resistance make; Which so deter'd the Sergeant, who was sent T'arrest the Five impeach'd by th'Government, That he, nor any one durst execute The Warrant, after their imperious Vote. The King displeas'd that Justice thus should be Obstructed by the Commons Tyranny, Taking his Nephew The Palsgrave., and the better sort Of Officers in waiting then at Court, T'attend his Person, with Impatience went To the Low'r stubborn House of Parliament, And ent'ring with his Nephew and no more, Demanded those he had Impeach'd before: But private Notice of the King's intent, From Court, by Carlisle's Countess being sent To the Five Members, they had timely fled The House before the King his Visit made; So that he only shew'd his Royal Mind, But fail'd of meeting those he hop'd to find. This warm Proceeding did the House enrage, And gave their Factious Spite so keen an edge, That Majesty no sooner did retire But the contentious Tribe were all on Fire, And Voted this Adventure of their Leige, To be the highest Breach of Privilege; Tho' in the Case of Arundel Earl. 't'ad been Asserted in the same immediate Reign, No Privilege of Parliament could reach To Treason, Felony, or any Breach Of Peace, so far as to protect or skreen From Justice any Man concern'd therein; Yet Faction gave their Tongues an odious loose, About this violence offer'd to the House, Reporting that the King had an intent To Murder sev'ral of the Parliament, That he had put the Commons, by severe And threat'ning Speeches, into bod'ly Fear. All which malicious Stories were aver'd, In Publick, by the daring Factious Herd, That Guards and Watches were in London set, To make the Peoples Jealousies more great, And their Trainbands appointed to secure The accus'd Members down to Westminster; As if they were the only worthy Five, By whom the Nation could subsist and thrive. Thus Faction always labours to support Those Friends the most, that do the greatest hurt, And to obscure their Crimes from common Eyes, Make all their basest Actions pass for wise. The King, amidst these Insults, with his Queen, And Children, fearing that his Foes might mean Some daring Mischief, did to Hampton-Court Retire, to be the more secure from hurt, Hoping his Absence might appease the Storm, That grew each Day more dangerously warm: During his stay at Hampton also sent A soothing Message to the Parliament, Which by both Houses was with Thanks receiv'd, That all good Men grew chearful and believ'd The King and Commons would be soon agreed, And all things in a happy Course succeed, Which apprehension made the Faction more Industrious to provoke the Sov'reign Pow'r, That their new Wedges, craftily apply'd, Might make the Breach irreparably wide; Accordingly the Faction in the House Prevailing, fram'd a vile and scandalous Petition, to beseech their gracious Prince, That as a Ground to raise their Confidence, He would vouchsafe to put into their Pow'r, The Navy, the Militia, and the Tow'r, Humbly desiring also the Command Of all the Forts and Castles in the Land. No Hist'ry sure of Heathen Rome or Greece, Can parallel such Impudence as this, Which must have been, for certain, disavow'd, Not only by the Gentry but the Crowd, Had not most Men, without Old-Bedlam, been More Lunatick than those that rav'd within. The King, tho' thus intollerably us'd, Their spiteful Pray'r most patiently refus'd, Tamely concealing those Resentments due From a good Prince to such an envious Crew, And with the Queen and Princess Mary went A melancholy Progress into Kent, Sending the Royal Mother and her Fair Young Offspring thence From Dover. into Batavian Air, In the cold Month of Febr'ary, before The Sun could well have thaw'd that freezing Shore. The King returning, when the Queen was gone, From Dover back to Canterbury Town, Where he was ill-advis'd, against his Will, To sign that factious and pernicious Bill, Which took the Rev'rend Bishops Votes away, And did to Wolves the Flock of Christ betray: But all these Condescensions were in vain, His yielding made them but the more complain. Therefore 'twas pity he so far comply'd, To gratify such thankless sullen Pride, Which, as 'twas founded upon impious Grounds, Tower'd so high it triumph'd beyond Bounds. The King, perceiving that the Commons meant No Union, but were mischievously bent, And finding no abatement of their Flame, To Greenwich-House, from Canterbury came, And sending for the Prince of Wales and Duke Of York, from thence to York a Progress took, Whilst two Petitions, insolently rude, From Parliament the giving Prince pursu'd, To humbly beg, as they had done before, No less, at once, than all the Sov'reign Pow'r; For whosoe'er endeavours to possess The whole Militia, grasps at nothing less; That the King knew, and therefore would not grant A Sute so bold and so extravagant. The House, however, forc'd it from the Throne, By a rebellious Ord'nance of their own, Settling the same, to work their pious Ends, I'th' trusty Hands of their Fanatick Friends, Which Act the King accounted, as he'd cause, An open violation of the Laws, That did at once sufficiently declare, Against their Sov'reign, a Rebellious War, And therefore he as speedily prepar'd To raise such Forces as might timely guard His Life 'gainst those who had their Game pursu'd So far, they only could be safe in Blood; Yet after all these cursed Steps they'd trod, Bolder than Rebels who provok'd their God, They falsly charg'd the War upon their Prince, And far outdid those Dev'ls in impudence. The End of the Seventeenth Year. THE Earl of Southampton's CHARACTER. In all respects he was a Noble Peer, Weighty his Eloquence, his Judgment clear; His Apprehension quick, his Wit expert, And without Study could his Parts exert: In all Debates would appositely speak, And to his Point with Resolution stick; But was too much to melancholy prone, And of all Company best lov'd his own. Was born a younger Brother, losing both His Father and his Elder in his Youth; And in his greener Years could not accord With much Attendance, or the Name of Lord, But, when a Boy, was thoughtfully inspir'd, And took most pleasure in a Life retir'd; Did a great Spirit in his Breast support, Yet car'd not to converse or climb at Court: Nor had he any Smiles or Favours thence, To tempt him early to attend his Prince, But, as reported, rather underwent Such Hardships as he'd reason to resent; Which made the Faction think the Earl inclin'd T'oppose the Court, who thus had prov'd unkind; That, when the Rump began, no injur'd Lord. Could be more follow'd, courted, and ador'd, Than young Southampton, by the Chiefs that led The Van of those that sought their Monarch's Head. Nor was the cautious Earl without a great Dislike of some Mismanagements of State: Or was his Noble Breast intirely clear Of Prejudice tow'rds that unhappy Peer The Earl of Strafford, tho' when once he saw The Steps the Faction made beyond the Law, All their Proceedings strongly he oppos'd, And with the Loyal Side intirely clos'd. Nor would his Temper be prevail'd upon T'accept of Court-Preferment from the Throne, Till both the Houses had been pleas'd to make A Protestation for themselves to take, Voting that none but such as would comply To swallow the same Poyson should enjoy Any Preferment in the Church or State: But Brave Southampton had a Soul too great To take the Dose, and scorning of their Vote, Was of the Privy-Council chose without. And when he saw the Faction press so hard, Was also of the Chamber made a Lord; In the King's Troubles prov'd a faithful Friend, And so continu'd to the barb'rous End: Was one of those four Mourning Peers who paid Their last sad Duties to their Prince when dead, And to refresh the Grave's insatiate Mouth, In show'rs of Tears wept Loyalty and Truth. Thus, when to punish a revolted Land, Rebels and Traytors gain the upper-hand, The Wicked triumph whilst the Just lament Those Ills they want due Power to prevent. THE CHARACTER OF THE Duke of Richmond. A gallant Worthy, to the King ally'd, Whose Royal Care was early to provide An Education that might suit with both The Birth and Genius of the Noble Youth; And to enlarge the Greatness of his Mind, By Nature to the best pursuits inclin'd, Sent him to France, to Italy, and Spain, That Foreign Learning might inrich his Brain, And Courts abroad to more Perfection rear Those gen'rous Scions graffed in him here: Was, to his Honour, by the Spaniard made A Grandee of that Kingdom when a Lad; And soon as he return'd, tho' under Age, Was call'd at home upon the Publick Stage, And, as the darling of his Sov'reign Lord, Was summon'd to the Privy-Council-Board; And, at the King's Request, soon after took To Wife sole Daughter of the murder'd Duke Buckingham., Whose Charms had twice ten thousand Pounds in store, And the King's Bounty to enlarge her Dow'r: So that the Noble Youth, before so great In Title, now was equal in Estate. Nor was his Knowledge in the least degree Inferior to his Wealth and Dignity; Yet entertain'd so slender a Conceit Of his own Foresight and superior Wit, That he'd be led sometimes by those not bless'd With half the Parts that he himself possess'd; Tho' no Man of his lofty Rank enjoy'd A greater Spirit or more awful Pride; To Honour's Rules he was exactly just, And scorn'd, for safety, to corrupt his Trust, But most intirely to the King resign'd His Person, Fortune, and his faithful Mind, Abhorring all those Arts which others us'd, For shelter, with those Rebels that abus'd His Royal Master, but undaunted stood, As if he scorn'd to save his Noble Blood, By asking Quarter at the hands of those Who did with hostile Force the Throne oppose. Nor would he at their Terms himself secure, By standing still to see the Sov'reign Pow'r O'erturn'd by trayt'rous Crowds, but to the End Perform'd his Duty, like a faithful Friend, Engag'd, when the Rebellious War begun, His own three Brothers to assist the Throne, Who boldly perish'd in the just defence Of their wrong'd Country and their injur'd Prince. Besides, his Fortune chearfully he spent, To serve his King, to whom at once he lent The Summ of Twenty-thousand Pounds, to show A good Example, when the Cause was low: For which kind Services the Senate took A violent Hatred to the Loyal Duke, And with their utmost Rancour still pursu'd The Hero for no more than Gratitude: But he continu'd Resolute and Brave, Tho' all his just Endeavours could not save His Royal Master from that murd'ring Blow, From whence our present Jars and Suff'rings flow; But when their Malice had so far presum'd, Took care to see the sacred Corps intomb'd, And to the martyr'd Clay, with melting Eyes, Perform'd a Loyal weeping Sacrifice. Thus all that Friends can do, when Friends are slain, Or die by Nature, is to mourn, in vain, A Loss no Tears or Sorrows can regain. THE Earl of Newcastle's CHARACTER. No English Hero, in his Noble Breast, More Honour carry'd, or more Worth possess'd; Of Loyalty his gallant Soul was full, His Courage fearless and invincible; By Nature Am'rous, Musical, and Mild, A Lamb at home, a Lyon in the Field. None could the War-Horse mount, or Rein command With better Grace, or with an abler Hand; Or use the pointed Weapon of Defence, In danger, with more skilful excellence. Nor could the best Professor of that Art Which charms the Eye and wins the Virgin's Heart, Adapt more graceful Steps to Musick's sound, Or from the yielding Floor more nimbly bound. To these were added Temper, Bounty, Wit, And all that could the Gentleman compleat; For which Perfections, no Man having more, The Earl was chose the Prince's Governour; Which, by the King, was from the Northern Lord, To Hertford's Marquis afterwards transfer'd; Yet when the Rebels had the War begun, None was more ready to assist the Throne, Or could with more Fidelity exert His Strength and Int'rest on his Sov'reign's part. Was Gen'ral in the North, and govern'd there With long Success and admirable Care, Possess'd himself of York, took many Towns. And made the Scots and Rebels dread his Frowns, Won sev'ral Battles, to his endless Fame, With smaller Numbers, to the Roundheads shame, And where his Troops were push'd and most opprest, With his own pers'nal Valour chear'd the rest, Amidst the wreaking Field undaunted stood, Fearing the loss of Honour more than Blood. Secur'd Newcastle timely for the Crown, Fix'd a strong Garison in Newark Town, Did all good Opportunities embrace, And long enjoy'd a Series of Success; Was made a Marquis by the grateful Throne, In honour to the glorious Deeds he'd done. But baneful Envy, who so often breeds Confusion, sowing her contentious Seeds Between the Marquis, of a Spirit great, And hasty Rupert, full of Martial heat, The fatal Strife their Armies discompos'd, When in the North they should have kindly clos'd, And with united Courage bravely fought The Roundheads, join'd with the rebellious Scot; But these untimely Discords that arose, Gave such advantage to their daring Foes, That tho', at length, the Prince and Marquis join'd, Each entertain'd a discontented Mind; Which prejudicial Feud so far had spread Through the two Armies, by the Heroes led, That wanting a true Union in their Pow'r, They both were overthrown at Marston-Moor; Which prov'd the first and most destructive Blow, That brought the King and Loyal Party low. The Marquis tortur'd with this fatal shock, His Troops half slain, the rest dispers'd and broke, Withdrew to Foreign Countries, where he bore The frowns of Fate like a Philosopher, Supporting still a brave and loyal Mind, To the King's Service stedfastly inclin'd, Waiting till wav'ring Fortune should agree To give him some fresh opportunity, Whilst hungry Traytors his Estate enjoy'd, Defac'd his Buildings and his Woods destroy'd. Such Hardships must the Just and Brave endure, When unrelenting Rebels gain the Pow'r, Who in the Name of God begin all Evil, And to reform the Church out-sin the Devil. The Lord Seymour's CHARACTER Brother to that brave Marquis Of Hertford. who maintain'd The Royal Cause so like a faithful Friend; A Man of Honour, Int'rest, and of great Repute in Wiltshire, where he liv'd in State, And did a gen'rous Character support, Without the flatt'ring Sunshine of the Court, His Parts and Knowledge being most imploy'd Among those Rural Comforts he enjoy'd, And in th'administration and a good Dispatch of Justice in his Neighbourhood; Was Knight for Wiltshire when the Rump began, And in that Station prov'd a mod'rate Man, When his old Friends the Loyal Cause declin'd, And warmly with the Factious Party join'd, For Strafford's Earl preserv'd a great Esteem, And was respected equally by him; Call'd by his Int'rest to the House of Peers, When Madness had possess'd the Commoners, Pursuing all things that might best evince His Gratitude to Strafford and his Prince; Like a true Subject with his Sov'reign went To York, and left the furious Parliament, Remaining truly fix'd, and always free To serve him with unstain'd Fidelity. Thus Honours by the Prince are well bestow'd Upon the Loyal, Grateful, and the Good; But misconfer'd become a Nation's Curse, Make Faction flourish and the Bad grow worse. A.D. 1642. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Eighteenth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1642. The King, when the proud Senate had declar'd Rebellious War, with equal haste prepar'd, And gave out his Commissions of Array, To such whose Honour fear'd not to obey, That they might levy Forces to secure The injur'd Kingdom and the Sov'reign Pow'r, Against that impious and destructive growth Of Disobedience terrible to both: And since the wav'ring Earl Northumberland, Who o'er the Royal Navy bore command, Seem'd indispos'd, that Post was by the Throne More worthily bestow'd on Sir John Pennington. But the Imperious Senate not content With the King's Choice, a Message to him sent March 28. In which they were so bold to recommend The Earl of Warwick, their obsequious Friend, To the same Trust, but Majesty thought fit To disapprove their Factious Favourite. However, they without the King's consent Gave him the Fleet by Pow'r of Parliament, And us'd such Arts that he possess'd the whole, In spight of Royal Care, without controul. For how should one good King, whose Hands are ty'd, Withstand Five-hundred cruel Tyrants Pride. When the last Treaty with the faithless Scot, Was to a present peaceful Issue brought, The King made Hull his Northern Magazine, And for his Royal use had lodg'd therein A costly store of Arms for Foot and Horse, Remanded from his late disbanded Force; Therefore the King was willing to possess, As early as he could, that useful Place; Accordingly he march'd with slender Guard Before the Town, but found the Gates were bar'd: He then demanded entrance, but the proud Rebellious Hotham on the Rampiers stood, Who, by the House of Commons, just before, Had been appointed trusty Governour, And with a brazen Confidence deny'd The King admittance, and his Pow'r defy'd: For which Indignity the Sov'reign Lord Proclaim'd him Traytor, as a just Reward, Demanding, by a Letter which he sent, Due satisfaction of the Parliament, Who, in contempt of their dishonour'd Prince, Approv'd and justify'd the Insolence, Giving their Rebel-Governour the Pow'r To raise Trainbands, to be the more secure. Sent also a Committee of their own Choice Members to abide within the Town; With whom they join'd some Lords, to guard the Place, And give their Impudence a nobler Face. All which additions to their Hero's Crime, The King was forc'd to bear with for a time, Whose Royal Mind b'ing now intent upon The Irish Suff'rings by Rebellion, Gave notice to the Senate 'twas his Will To visit that unhappy bleeding Isle; And that he meant to raise Two-hundred Horse Near Chester, and Two-thousand Foot, which Force He did intend should be Embark'd on Board, And wafted thither for his Body-Guard: But the dissembling Senate seem'd to be So over-careful of His Majesty; That they oppos'd his Voyage all they cou'd, And so much Love in their Objections shew'd, As if the hazard of the King by Sea Was the chief Point that made 'em disagree; When 'twas their fear that upon this pretence He might an Army raise in his defence; Therefore, in answer to a Message sent, By Sov'reign Goodness to the Parliament, They spoke their Mind, and honestly declar'd Against his Expedition and his Guard; Concluding, if His Majesty without Consent of Parliament should go about To levy Forces, that they must declare Against it, as a making open War: Yet they'd the face, tho' they deny'd their Prince A Guard, to raise one for their own defence; And thereupon His Majesty thought fit To summon all the Gentry round In Yorkshire. to meet His Royal Person, and to them made known Th'Indignities impos'd upon the Throne By Parliament, who, contrary to Law, Had wrested from him the Militia, And countenanc'd the Treason which had been By Hotham acted in his Magazine Of Hull; and that his Person and his Pow'r Requir'd a speedy Guard to be secure, Desiring their Assistance, that he might Be able to protect his Sov'reign Right, The Church, the Laws, and publick Liberty, From Violation and Oppression free. The Yorkshire Gentry readily agreed, And all the King desir'd they frankly did, Which so provok'd the Senate that they made A pois'nous Declaration, which they spread With great Industry, urging whosoe'er Should take up Arms, and to the King repair, Attend his Person, upon what pretence Soever, that the same was an offence Against the Laws, that they disturb'd the Peace, To th'hazard of the Kingdom's Liberties, Threat'ning that all such Enemies should be Forthwith proceeded with accordingly. But still their bugbear Arts could not deter The Loyal Gentry of that Northern-shire, From doing a sincere and duteous part To their wrong'd Sov'reign with a chearful Heart. The Breach began to widen now apace, And Faction grow more insolent and base, That many Members, liking not the Work In hand, retir'd from Westminster to York; And more, e'relong, did of the Peers attend The King, than with the Parliament remain'd. However, that the Commons might appear Much less dejected than they really were, They sent up an Impeachment to accuse Nine of the Lords who had forsook the House, After the Parliament a Vote had made, That those who serv'd the King the Land betray'd And thereupon the Lords, to shew their free Concurrence with the Commons tyranny, Censur'd the Nine, and render'd them unfit, For evermore, among the Peers to sit, Who also did adjudge that they should lose All Privilege of Parliament, as Foes, And, during Pleasure of the House, remain In Prison, from the time they should be ta'en. The Keeper Littleton. at this Juncture also sent The Seal to York unknown to Parliament, And, free of all suspicion, stole away, Foll'wing the same the next succeeding Day, Both welcome to the King, but prov'd a great Surprise to Faction, who pursu'd too late. The King by Nature Merciful and Good, Unwilling to involve the Land in Blood, Still us'd his best Endeavours to appease The Parliament by frequent Messages; But in return (most injur'd Prince) receiv'd Replies so odious scarce to be believ'd: Among the rest, to their eternal shame, They did a craving vile Petition frame, With nineteen Propositions, which they sent, Expressing all that could be Insolent, Insisting upon e'ery thing that might Divest him wholly of his Sov'reign Right, Concluding, with a Forehead made of Brass, That if he'd graciously vouchsafe to pass The Articles they'd tender'd at his Feet, They'd make him Happy, Glorious, and Great. But Royal Patience warm'd and overborn, With Anger made a sutable return, Sharply reminding them of all their late Dishonours offer'd to the Regal State, Told them he would no Duke of Venice be, But as a King preserve his Royalty. Both sides with great Industry now prepar'd T'augment their Strength and stand upon their guard, The Senate, by an Order, offering Eight Per Cent to all that brought in Coin or Plate, Which to Guild-Hall was conjur'd in apace, By all the Factious Saints, who had the Grace To give the Good Old Cause a helping hand, In hopes to bear Dominion o'er the Land. Mean while, the King his Royal Mind declar'd To an Assembly of the Peers, who heard His gracious Will with infinite content, And, in return, subscrib'd an Instrument, Wherein they strictly bound themselves to be Obedient to His Sacred Majesty: Also declar'd that 'twas their true intent, To stand by the just Rights of Parliament; But disavow'd whate'er the same should do Or act without the King's Assent thereto. The Royal Suff'rer now thought fit to Pen A Letter to the May'r and Aldermen Of London, to command them to decline All Contributions of their Plate and Coin, To forward an unlawful War, begun By both the Houses, 'gainst the Royal Throne, Inviting them to serve the Sov'reign Pow'r, On Terms the Senate had propos'd before. Then to his Peers and Counsellors, who staid At York, a solemn new Profession made, Affirming, that it was not his intent To begin War upon his Parliament, Which by a Declaration of the Lords, Express'd in cogent and pathetic Words, Was strengthen'd to remove that false Report, Scatter'd by Faction, to the King's great hurt; For their own shameful Ills they disavow'd, And charg'd upon the Throne to blind the Crowd. The King, however, by the Means he us'd, Discharg'd himself as fast as they accus'd, And by the Proclamations that he spread, Speeches and Protestations timely made, So won the North that he appear'd to be, In a few Weeks, in great Prosperity. From York he went to Newark, whither came The Gentry of the Shire of Nottingham. From thence his Course to Lincoln City steer'd, Where all that County Quality appear'd: At both which Meetings, in prevailing kind Orations he declar'd his Royal Mind; And by the Truths he spoke, with great Applause, Won duteous Numbers to espouse his Cause; And then return'd to York, from whence he went To Beverly, from thence a Message sent To both the Houses, to require the Town Of Hull to be surrender'd to the Crown, Or that he was resolv'd to have recourse To Arms, and would attempt the same by Force. But the proud Senate not enough afraid To yield so far, a saucy Answer made, Petitioning the King that he'd disband His Forces first, and forthwith countermand All his Commissions of Array, dismiss His Guards and come to's Parliament in Peace; Yet voted, in their crafty odious Cant, An Army for the King and Parliament, Against the Nation's Foes, should out of hand Be levy'd, under Essex's Command, With whom both Houses also did protest To live and die i'th' Cause they had embrac'd. The King no longer his Design delay'd, But now from York tow'rds Hull advances made, Where Sir John Meldrum had been lately sent With Reinforcements 500 Men. by the Parliament, And Hotham being luckily supply'd With the advantage of a swelling Tide, Drew up the Sluces, by which means he drown'd, Upon the King's approach, the Country round: So that the Monarch, hopeless of Success, Withdrew his Northern Forces from the Place, For his raw Troops and Captains were unskill'd In Sieges, and unpractis'd in the Field. Now Essex, with impatient Zeal and Care, Push'd on the fatal bus'ness of the War, And all those leading Members, who with Words Began the Mischief, now advanc'd their Swords, And, like stanch Rebels, to compleat their foul Audacious Ends, endanger'd Life and Soul. The King, in the mean time, to Leic'ster went, Where his kind Speeches gave such great Content, That numbers of the Gentry in the Town And Country to the Royal Cause were won, Tho' the two Houses had declar'd before For raising the Trainbands, and all the Pow'r They could, to kill and slay the Enemies To publick Safety and the Nation's Peace, Naming the King's Commissioners Of Array., and most O'th' Peers His Majesty thought fit to trust, As his Lieutenants of those Counties where His Int'rest did most promising appear. The King, to ballance what his Foes had done, Proclaim'd their Gen'ral Traytor to the Throne, Declaring other Officers imploy'd By Parliament, to justify their Side, All guilty of High-Treason 'gainst the Crown, Unless their Arms were instantly laid down. Whilst the proud Senate, who were over free Of shrewd Returns to injur'd Majesty, Declar'd that whosoever should forsake The King, and to the Parliament come back, Within ten Days, should have a Pardon free, And be receiv'd with Love and Amity, Except such Persons as already stood Impeach'd of Treason 'gainst the Publick Good, And others The Duke of Richmond, the Earls of Bristol, Cumberland, Newcastle, Rivers, Carnarvan: Viscounts, Newark and Faulkland, [illeg.]Gary Nicholas, Endymion Porter, and Mr. Edward Hyde. nam'd at large, as eminent Betrayers of the King and Parliament. Thus both Sides, by exchange of angry Words, Prepar'd their Spleen to exercise their Swords, As Rival Mastiffs, moving to engage, With Growls and Snarls foment their growing Rage. The King appris'd an Army would be sent Into the Western Parts, by Parliament, Gave Hertford a Commission over all Those Counties as Lieutenant-General, That he might raise such Forces as might awe The West, and to the King the People draw, Both sides with danger mutually allarm'd, With equal Caution thus for safety arm'd, Whilst the dull Herd, as temper'd by their Guides, And led by others Int'rest, chose their Sides. To Nottingham the wand'ring Monarch steer'd His Course, and there his Royal Standard rear'd August 20.. Whence, to both Houses, he a Message sent By the Earl of Southampton and Sir John Colpepper., To shew his Inclination to prevent The War, desiring they'd appoint a Place And Persons to consult and treat of Peace: But this Compliance only made his Foes More proud, and came to nothing in the close; As if the Senate were resolv'd to reign, Or try the Cause upon the dusty Plain. The two Bohemian Princes now came o'er, T'assist their Uncle on the British Shore, Rupert b'ing trusted to command the best Of the King's Forces 'twixt the North and West, Where, early in the War he push'd at all, And prov'd, at first, a prosp'rous General. From Nottingham His Majesty remov'd, And, ranging all the neighb'ring Shires, improv'd His Army, which he led to Shrewsb'ry Town, Where his small Force, in three Weeks time, were grown Into a Body, as Records compute, Of full Eleven-thousand Horse and Foot, Which the kind Monarch by his Speeches gain'd, Giving to Lindsey's Earl the Chief Command. Now sev'ral Parties were abroad in Arms, And daily gave each other fresh Alarms. Portsmouth, by Goring, for the King possess'd, Was close besieg'd by Meincle, and distress'd So far, for want of Succour, that the Town Surrender'd, much to th'damage of the Crown, Which Hertford, in some measure, did repay, By seizing Sherborne-Castle in his way, Giving to Bedford's Earl a small defeat, Altho' his Rebel-Force was much more great. Then cross'd the Severn, upon this Success, And did in Wales a further Army raise, Where, to their endless Fame, from Faction free, They glory'd in unspotted Loyalty, The Rebels Army, at Northampton-Town, Were now, at least, to Sixteen-thousand grown, Where they remain'd with Roberts and with Brook, Those conscious pious Lords, till Essex took A solemn Farewel September the 9th. of his Lords the Rump, And to their Rendezvous march'd down in Pomp, Who, by their Gen'ral, to their Sov'reign sent A fawning vile Petition, with intent To humbly beg he would forsake, in time, Those wicked Persons who surrounded him, And not to share the Dangers they had brought Upon themselves, by Mischiefs they had wrought, But that he would return without his Force To Parliament, and take some speedy course To heal those Breaches daily growing worse. E'er Essex tarry'd at Northampton long, He'd made his Forces Twenty-thousand strong, With which he march'd, from Interuption free, To that old factious Town of Coventry; From thence to Warwick, which he left, at length, Moving tow'ds Worc'ster, to encrease his Strength, Having receiv'd Advice, some Days before, The King inclin'd that way with all his Pow'r, For Sir John Byron had possess'd the Town, In time, with a small Party, for the Crown, And did the same most gallantly defend, Whilst Captain Fiennes attack'd the Western End, Having been wrong ascertain'd by a Spy, That Essex Army was approaching nigh, Which prov'd Prince Rupert, who, to reinforce The Town had brought Five-hundred able Horse, That Fiennes drew off his Men from the Assault, And at a safer distance made a halt, Till Sandy's Regiment of Horse advanc'd; Which timely Succours chear'd and countenanc'd Th'Assailants, that they now resolv'd to make, With their joint Force, a second bold Attack, Which the Prince guessing, drew his Forces out The Town, into a Field adjoining to't, Where, after a sharp Action, Rupert beat The Rebels, and compel'd 'em to retreat, Retiring into Worc'ster when he'd done, With all the Marks of Vict'ry he had won; But hearing, Gen'ral Essex, at the Head Of a strong Host, his near Approaches made, The Prince concluded 'twas the safer way To quit the Town than hazard longer stay; Nor was he wrong, for he was scarce remov'd, But as he'd been precaution'd, so it prov'd. The Royal Int'rest now advanc'd apace, And the King's Cause put on a prosp'rous face, The Northern Gentry, who espous'd the Throne, Commanded by Newcastle, strong were grown, That Fairfax and his Son their Power fear'd, And fled where'er the Loyal Side appear'd: In Cornwal, Greenvil, Slaning, and the brave Experienc'd Hopton, their Assistance gave, And, by their Int'rest, rais'd a growing Force Of sturdy Foot and serviceable Horse; Whilst Loyal Wales, and many Parts beside, The Royal Cause with fresh Recruits supply'd. The King now About the middle of October. drew his Troops from Shrewsbury, And march'd from thence to summon Coventry, But they rebel'd against the Sov'reign Pow'r, And answer'd him as Hotham had before. From thence the Royal Hero march'd away To Southam, near to which the Rebels lay, And being then 'twixt Essex and the Town Of London, both the Houses thereupon Were struck with Terror, and began to raise The City Bands, and fortify each Place That lay the most expos'd, with Trenches, Forts, And Military Works of sundry sorts; Whilst Essex did to Keinton boldly bring His Host, but Six Miles distance from the King, Who now prepar'd for Action, with what speed He could, and to Edgehil his Army led, Where, on advantage Ground, he took his Post, And drew up Fourteen-thousand Men Foot 10000, Horse and Dragoons 4000. at most, Lindsey commanding the undaunted Force, Whilst Rupert led the Kings Right-Wing of Horse, And of the Left, in number not so large, Leiutenant-General Ruthen had the Charge. When thus the King the open Field had ta'en, Essex drew out upon a spacious Plain, Whose distance scarce was half a measur'd Mile From the King's Army, posted on the Hill; The Rebels Horse which to the Right were drawn, Were under the Command of Stapleton Sir Philip; The Left was in the Field of Battle led By Sir James Ramsey, Commissary Gen'ral made, Whilst Essex in the Body gave Command; And thus array'd both Armies made a stand: At length, the King perceiving they had laid Close to the Hill a dang'rous Ambuscade, Sent a sufficient Party to engage Those Musqueteers, and drive 'em from the Hedge But the mean while the Foe their Ord'nance plaid, And both sides now began to Canonade; Which Martial Thunder did their Courage whet, That both the Vans with equal Fury met, Whose Gallantry so warm'd the rest, that all Fell on as if their Blood was turn'd to Gall. The Royal Force prevailing from the first, Till the cow'd Foe in shatter'd Troops dispers'd; But Hambden, coming with a fresh Brigade, Succour'd the Rebels with such timely Aid, That those who fled dispirited before, Now rally'd and sustain'd their sinking Pow'r, With so much Resolution none could tell, For hours, which side was likely to prevail, Till Rupert by incessant Toil, at length, Routing the Foes Left Wing, their chiefest Strength, Supported those by his successful Sword, That Hambden's fresh Supplies had overpower'd; By which good Conduct Royal Charles obtain'd A great and glorious Vict'ry in the End; Tho' in the warm Dispute the Hero lost That worthy Peer, the Gen'ral of his Host, Yet made the Rebels fly the wreaking Plain, And was left Master of Six-thousand slain; Took Banb'ry-Castle when the strugling Fight Was over, in the beaten Gen'rals sight; Where also he'd the lucky Chance to gain Sufficient Arms for Fifteen-hundred Men; Then enter'd Oxford in triumphant Pomp, With all the Trophies A Hundred and fifty Colours. taken from the Rump, Whilst Essex march'd to Worc'ster, to revive Those shatter'd Rebels that were left alive, To London leaving all the Country free And open for victorious Majesty; Who, quiting Oxford, slow Advances made Through Abington to Henly, where he staid Some days, refresh'd his Troops, and, when he'd done, Tow'rds London march'd, so near as Colebrook-Town; Whither, the frighted trembling Parliament A smooth Petition very humbly sent, Praying the King would shew 'em so much Grace, As to abide at some convenient place, Till they could send Committees to compose Th'unhappy Diff'rence without further Blows. To which the King as kind an Answer gave As they themselves could hope or wish to have; But Essex had e're now thought fit to bring His Army as near London as the King, And having lodg'd his Forces up and down At Acton, Kingston, and at Windsor Town, He stole a welcome Visit November 7. to his dear Astonish'd Friends conven'd at Westminster, Who thank'd him for the Dangers he had run, Altho' a weaker Force the Battle won; And gave him, after all his ill Success, Five-thousand Pounds to wipe off the Disgrace, And sent him, with an Army they had rais'd In Town, to Brentford, which if once possest, And well secur'd, must into danger bring The Person and the Quarters of the King, Who call'd a Council where 'twas soon agreed, That a strong Party should be sent with speed, To drive the City-Bands from Brentford Town, Brought thither by their Zeal t'oppose the Crown, That in the End a sharp Dispute arose, Wherein the King prevail'd against his Foes, Much Amunition took, Five-hundred Men, Eleven Colours, Ordinance Fifteen, Their greatest Officer then present kill'd, And with Rebellious Numbers stain'd the Field, The King next Day resolving to advance To London, but receiv'd Intelligence, That Essex with his Army, upon this Defeat, and Warwick with Auxiliaries, At Turnham-Green, were formidably join'd To Stop him if tow'rds London he inclin'd. Therefore the King revok'd his first Intent, And passing Kingston-Bridge to Oatlands went. From thence remov'd to Reading, which he made A Garison, and then to Oxford led His weary Troops, where for a time he staid. The Brentford Action much enrag'd the Saints, Who fill'd the City with their loud Complaints, And by Petition did the Rump beseech, They'd use no further means to heal the Breach, But countermand the Measures they'd begun, In order to'n Accomodation: Which humble Caution pleas'd their Lords so well That they return'd their Thanks, to shew their Zeal For War, that when the just and brave were slain, The Pious Faction might in safety reign. For tho' Rebellion has her Guides to paint The Hell-born Offspring like a Heav'nly Saint, And with misconstrued Scriptures make her shine, Like the vile Serpent in his speckled Skin, Yet those that raise her, only want the Pow'r To rob their Country and be still secure, The End of the Eighteenth Year.

A merry Peer and Counsellor of State, First made by James, the Royal Father, Great, Yet 'twas no wonder he forsook the Son, And into Violence with the Faction run, Since in the best of Times he never serv'd His Sov'reign well, but from his Duty swerv'd. Nor did he think the Honour which the Throne Had giv'n him ought to bind him to the Crown, Since 'twas thro' Policy, not Love, bestow'd Upon his Lordship, in a wav'ring Crowd Of Persons, such as James would never trust, Knowing their Minds too well to think 'em just, Yet, for some Reasons in the State, confer'd Titles upon 'em which they ill deserv'd; Therefore the grateful Earl much rather chose To help his Friends, who did the Court oppose, Because to them he ow'd, as he believ'd, The Royal blast of Honour he'd receiv'd. So thriving Hypocrites adore the Priest, But slight the Heav'nly Pow'r by whom they're blest. In Conversation he'd a sparkling Wit, That render'd him for Boon-Companions fit, Giving his Words and Actions such an air Of Levity, and trespassing so far Beyond the Bounds of Modesty that few Could more indecent Liberties pursue; And no Man, of his Dignity, profess So little Vertue, or promote it less, That 'tis a perfect Myst'ry to conceive, Which way a Peer, thus qualify'd, should give So great a Sanction, in a Christian Land, To that good Work the Godly took in hand; And that he should to such a height advance The Int'rest of those meek Reforming Saints, Who, tho' they're ne'er so vile, pretend to Grace, And hide their Vices with a plous Face. But, after all his Faults, he had so great A sway with those Reformers of the State, Whose boundless Envy, conscious of no Crimes, Began the Mischiefs of those restless Times, That all the puritannick Tribe ador'd Their friendly Earl as their protecting Lord; Who welcom'd to his House, for sake of Praise, Their silenc'd Teachers, in the dismal Days Of Persecution, such as taught the Land To cry aloud, that Pop'ry was at hand, Feasting the Factious Guides of e'ery sort, Altho' he made their Function but his Sport; Which they dispens'd with, for the blessed use Of such a Patron's hospitable House, And gracing their Devotions with his kind Appearance, tho' to little good inclin'd; Became their Moses, and the Head of all The Faction that conspir'd their Prince's Fall, And, by dissembling, tho' so loose and vain, Acquir'd the Title of a Godly Man, A sacred Character confer'd alone On those who had the greatest Mischiefs done, In order to subvert the sinking Throne. Was made the Rump's High-Admiral at Sea, And there Commanded to his Infamy, Till Cromwel, who their restless Temper knew, By Sword disbanded that Rebellious Crew; And then the Earl did with his Highness close, Courted his Favour and withstood his Foes, Sought his Protection, forc'd his Heir to wed The Rebel's Daughter, to disgrace his Bed; Preserving, whilst he govern'd, so intire A Friendship with th'aspiring Lucifer, That when the Brutus dy'd, the other griev'd To see the Nation by his Fall reliev'd, Having so well improv'd, by Arts and Wiles, His Fortune, under the Protector's Smiles, That what by Factious Bounty he'd impair'd, E'er Cromwel made a Scepter of his Sword, He left, at his Departure, much encreas'd, Whilst Loyal Crouds of their Estates were fleec'd. Nor need we wonder that Success should wait On such nefarious Instruments of Fate, Since sad Experience shews the World too plain, The Wicked always thrive when Rebels reign. THE CHARACTER OF THE Lord Viscount Falkland. In Wit and Learning none could more abound, His Knowledge universally profound; In Friendship just, in Conversation free, Obliging, but averse to Flattery; Not fond of Court-Advancements, tho' compleat In all things, and for high Preferments fit; Was, to the Honour of that Country, bred In Ireland, where his Father was the Head Deputy., And crossing into England to enjoy, At Age, a Fortune left him By his Grandfather, his Parents then living. when a Boy, Was, at his first arrival here, to seek For Friends, to whom he might with freedom speak; But in a little time that want supply'd So wisely, that the Greatest ne'er enjoy'd A better Converse to improve their Parts In State-Affairs, and ministerial Arts, Holding no Friendship but with Persons rich In Mind, sublim'd above the common pitch, Whose Knowledge and Integrity were such, That neither had been blemish'd with Reproach. To Learning his Affections were so strong, That being ign'rant of the Grecian Tongue, Tho' none with more Reluctance could forsake The Town, he did a Resolution make, To never see the same till he attain'd That Language, and accordingly remain'd At his own Rural Seat, till he could speak And, like a good Grammarian, construe Greek, Performing the Herculean Task so soon, That none would credit in what time 'twas done. Thus willing Minds that have no Cares to teaze, The hardest Labours overcome with ease, Whilst the poor starving Genius fumbling sits, And 'twixt his Books and Wants divides his Wits. His Seat within few Miles of Oxford stood, A House of Bounty to the Learn'd and Good, Where all such studious Gownmen as were stor'd With Parts, were welcome to the Gen'rous Lord, That his frequented Palace seem'd to be A less, but nobler University, Where the best Wits retir'd, to purge the Rules Of Wisdom from the Errors of the Schools, And at a proper distance to remove The subtil Serpent from the harmless Dove, And in a less corrupted Air refine, From worldly Craft, what truly was divine. By learn'd and wise Companions, such as these, The Lord improv'd his Talents by Degrees, Till he, at length, was look'd upon to be The single mirrour of Humanity, Whose Parts and universal Knowledge were A compound Prodigy, without compare: Yet, as no humane Wisdom is secure From doubtful Views, of what relate to Pow'r, So the young Lord, a stranger to the Cheats Of Faction, and unskill'd in their Deceits, Was influenc'd to entertain no good Opinion of the Rev'rend Primate Laud; And therefore, by mistaken Zeal, was mov'd To use some Rigour, not to be approv'd, Was also one of those that gave his Vote To rashly drive that Holy Order out The House of Lords, believing that the end Of the proud Faction did no further tend, And therefore thought complying with that Bill, Might give diversion to a greater Ill, Conciliate those Jars that might encrease, And suddenly o'erturn the Publick Peace; But when he found the Point in hand was meant No more than previous to a worse Intent, Upon the second Bill The first Bill was frustrated. he chang'd his Mind, And shew'd himself quite diff'rently inclin'd, Bending his Forces, which were truly great, In just defence of both the Church and State, Which made the King desirous to secure A Friend so useful to the Sov'reign Pow'r, By such Preferment that might best engage A gen'rous Mind in such a wav'ring Age; Tho' 'twas believ'd by all, no gainful Trust Would make him swerve from what he thought was just, But that he'd act pursuant to the Laws, And give new Credit to the Royal Cause. These Motives chiefly made the King desire To have a Man of so much Honour nigh'r, Who, at so dangerous a time of Day, Would neither faulter, flatter, nor betray, Thus Royal Goodness having pitch'd upon The well-accomplish'd Peer to serve the Throne, After some struggles with himself, the Lord Was to the Secretary's Seat prefer'd; In which mysterious Post he prov'd not quite So active and so useful as he might; For he had too much Honour to imploy That odious treach'rous Parasite, a Spy, Or to encourage such a dang'rous Brood Of Bosom-Snakes, who fawningly intrude Into Mens Conversation, to betray Whate'er they act imprudently or say; Nay, tempt by Wiles the Weak and Innocent, To rashly speak those things they never meant; And when they've done, to open Shame expose The Fools deluded, as the Nation's Foes: By these good Methods Plots and Projects frame, To charge and punish others for the same. Such Services as these, the worthy Lord, And all such wicked Instruments, abhor'd, Knowing in Justice no Man ought to give Credit to Villains, who by treach'ry live, And that 'twas shameful in a State that Rules, To work their Ends by such audacious Tools. For Plots projected by depending Rogues, Turn Kings to Storks and Subjects into Frogs. All other Parts of his officious Care With Justice and Discretion manag'd were, So far as the Affairs of State comply'd With that strict Honour which he made his Guide, But when the War broke out, b'ing much inclin'd To publick Peace, as well as Peace of Mind, It chang'd his Temper, made him grow morose, Tho' never wean'd him from the Royal Cause, And turn'd his natural facetious Air, To the rough Carriage of a Man of War, That all his Friends were much amaz'd to find His nat'ral Calmness totally declin'd, And that a Soldier's Spirit had possess'd So mod'rate and so peaceable a Breast, That Toil and Hazard rather seem'd to please His Appetite, than safe unactive Ease: Not but he always was to Peace a Friend, But daring when it could not be obtain'd; Maintaining still his Secretary's Post, Till he at once his Life and Office lost, Resigning both at Newb'ry, in the Field Of Battle, by a fatal Bullet kill'd, As boldly charging with undaunted Force, In the front Rank of Noble Byron's Horse. Falling among the Valiant and the Just, Who dy'd that Day an Honour to their Trust, And quench'd with Loyal Blood the drought of trodden Dust. Such is the Fate of War, that worthless Slaves Survive the Battle and escape their Graves, Whilst Men of Worth, who grace the martial Plain, By cruel Chance are undistinguish'd slain. THE CHARACTER OF Sir John Colepeper. A worthy Patriot and a Knight for Kent, In the long-sitting Factious Parliament, Call'd to the Council-Table when the Storm Blew high, and restless Spirits grew too warm, And to oblige him to the Crown the more, Was also made Exchequer Chancellor, At the same time when Falkland was prefer'd Toth' Signet-Office and the Council-Board; Which Favours so bestow'd gave great Offence To Faction, and inflam'd their Insolence, Whose haughty Leaders had themselves an Eye, Not only on th'Exchequer-Chancery, But also on the Secretary's Place, To give their ill Designs a better Face, And that they might at once deprive their Prince Of all the Benefits that flow'd from thence; But Royal Wisdom did the Snare avoid, And honour'd those, too just to be decoy'd. The worthy Knight from all Corruption free, Persisting in unspotted Loyalty, And thro' the dismal Series bravely run, From the first Crisis that the Flame begun, Doing the faithfull'st Service that he cou'd In times of wrangling and in those of Blood, Neglecting nothing that he thought might be Of use and safety to His Majesty, But long surviv'd that black Infernal Day, When Sov'reign Pow'r at cruel Mercy lay; That Day which is a scandal to the Year, The Law, the Kingdom, and the Kalendar; And liv'd to see those Rebels, who, in War, Had sham'd their proud Example Lucifer, Trembl'at the Justice of the Royal Son, And swing for those tremendous Ills they'd done. Thus, tho' the Cruel and the Proud sometimes Are spar'd a while to glory in their Crimes, Yet Heav'n its Vengeance on their Heads will pour, When they conceit themselves the most secure. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Edward Nicholas. No mortal Man more Honesty could boast, Or with more Faith discharge his trusty Post: Nor were his great Industry and his Care To his Fidelity inferior; Well vers'd in Bus'ness, which but few had been, Who'd held of late that Office he was in. When young, at Oxford he some time had spent, And from that Nurs'ry to the Temple went; From thence to France, according to the Mode, He travel'd and imploy'd some Years abroad; Was Secretary made, at his return, To the Lord Zouch, of the King's Cinque-Ports Ward'n By which he rightly understood the Charge Of all that Jurisdiction, which is large; And when his Lord surrender'd up the same, That it might be confer'd on Buckingham, Then Admiral, yet faithful Nicholas Was, for his Worth, continu'd in his Place, Promoted also by the Duke to be Chief Secretary of the Adm'ralty. After whose Death, when Majesty impowr'd Commissioners to Rule the Navy-Board, Preserv'd his Post, and as a further Mark Of Royal Favour, was appointed Clerk O'th' Privy-Council, in that Sphere remain'd, Till Windebank for Safety fled the Land, Then by the King was honour'd with the great And trusty Post of Secretary 'f State, Which he discharg'd without the least Offence, With true Fidelity and Diligence, Proving an honest and industrious Man, To the last Period of his vital Span. Nor do the Just and Faithful only find On Earth good Fortune and content of Mind, But to the World bequeath, whene'er they die, Examples worthy of Posterity. A.D. 1643. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1643. The Rump now having fortify'd the Town Of Glouc'ster with an able Garison, Began t'enlarge their Quarters e'ery Day, Tow'rds Oxford, where the Royal Hero lay, Also to Ci'cester great Strength had drawn To carry their Design the better on: But the wise King foreseeing that no good Would spring from such a treach'rous Neighbourhood, Commanded Rupert with Four-thousand Horse And Foot, t'attempt the latter Town by force, Who marching near it made a cunning Feint, As if alone to Sudely-Castle bent, Then of a sudden turning all his Pow'r Upon the Town, subdu'd it in an Hour, Took Arms Three-thousand, which in store were laid, And more than twice Five-hundred Captives made Yet all this great Success did not so far Elate the King as to approve the War, Which brought upon his Subjects such a flood Of Miseries, and drown'd the Land in Blood, But that he still endeavour'd to regain His Peoples Safety, and a peaceful Reign, And did, in order thereunto, propose A Treaty, with his Senatory Foes, To which the Rump unwillingly comply'd, And by their Shams and Shuffles still destroy'd, Recall'd their Agents from the King, to Town, And slighted all the Offers of the Crown, Sending their Gen'ral Essex to invest Reading, by Colonel. Fielding for the King possest, Who was not able to defend the place, Against the Rebels, above sixteen Days, By reason that a Pestilence arose, And forc'd 'em to surrender to their Foes: Yet Fielding by a Martial-Court was try'd, And sentenc'd to be shot, and must have dy'd For Treach'ry, but the King who thought his case Too rigid, shew'd him Mercy in Distress. The War so universal now became That e'ery Shire was in a Martial Flame; And the King's Party, cherish'd by Success, Daily gain'd Ground almost in e'ery place. In Stafford, Warwick and Northamptonshire, Many severe Encounters pass'd this Year, Twixt Rupert and Earl of Northampton, for the Crown, And for the Rump, Lord Brook, Sir John Gell, and Sir William Bruerton. The Earl on the King's part, at Hopton-Heath, Submitted bravely to the Gasps of Death. And Brook, whose Pray'rs had hasten'd on his Doom, Perish'd at Litchfield, in his Lodging-Room; That other Rebels, who espous'd so black A Cause, might dread the like, and warning take; Yet Litchfield close was by the Roundheads ta'en, After their Gen'ral was so strangely slain See the Lord Brook's Character.; But by the Prince retaken, and restor'd To the King's Forces, by the dint of Sword. Wales also, or at least the major part, Did on the King's behalf themselves exert; But Stamford's Earl was by the Senate sent With a fresh Army Westward, to prevent The growth of Fortune, which increas'd too fast On the King's Side, for his Success to last. At the same juncture Hopton lay before The Town of Plymouth, in the Rebels pow'r; But hearing timely of the Earl's advance Into those Parts, withdrew his Forces thence; Nor had he any prospect of Success Against the Town, which made him quit the Place More willingly, the season of the Year, By Rain and Cold, b'ing render'd too severe For such hard Service, therefore he withdrew To faithful Cornwal, always brave and true, Whither Scotch Ruthen Governour of Plymouth., follow'd with a far Superior Force from Plymouth, Exeter, And Devon drawn, with other Troops that met The Scot from Dorset and from Somerset; The Rump thereby not doubting, in a trice, But to subdue their Cornish Enemies, Whose active Courage and untainted Hearts, Did 'em much Mischief in the Western Parts: But Hopton being earnestly inclin'd To fight, e'er Stamford's Earl had Ruthen join'd; The latter being also fond to try, His Fortune in the Field of Victory, Without the Earl, unwilling he should share The Laurels he himself propos'd to wear: So that both sides being forward to engage At Bradock-Down they met with equal Rage, Where Hopton with his Cornish Force prevail'd, And by exemplar Courage won the Field, Pursu'd the Rebels, who confus'dly fled, Near Thirteen-hundred Victims captive made, Took all their Canon, and in Triumph brought Most of their Ensigns off the wreaking Spot, Whilst Ruthen disappointed of his Aim, To Saltash fled, and fortify'd the same With store of Canon, which some Ships supply'd, That in that Harbour did at Anchor ride, Bringing a Vessel of Four-hundred Tuns, Well lin'd with able Hands and sixteen Guns, Close by the Town, where she had full Command Of sev'ral distant Avenues by Land, Believing now himself and Troops secure Against the Victor and his Cornish Pow'r. But Hopton boldly follow'd, Storm'd the Town, And drove 'em from their Works and Batt'ries soon, Making a greater Slaughter of the Foe, In this, than in the former Overthrow; Ruthen himself escaping in a Boat, And with much hazard into Plymouth got; Whilst frighted Numbers in the Storm o'erpowr'd, Perish'd by Drowning, to avoid the Sword. Thus did those Forces which the Rump made sure To ruin, conquer a superior Pow'r These Actions happen'd in January.. Stamford who'd heard of Ruthen's first Defeat, To wisely save himself from being beat, Retir'd to Tavistock, where Sir John Berkly came, Brave Sir Nicholas Slanning, Sir Bevil Greenvil, Col'nel Ashburnham, With a strong Party of the Western Horse And Cornish Foot, to visit Stamford's Force; But the Rump Earl, forewarn'd of their Intent, Forsook his Quarters, and for safety sent Part of his Roundheads, in a panick Fear, To Plymouth, and the rest to Exeter. However, tho' the Birds of prey were flown, The Cornish Forces rested in the Town, Where they refresh'd, for many Days, to ease Their native County Tavistock is in Devonshire. of the Miseries That wait on Armies, whose devouring Troops, Make Havock of the toiling Farmer's Crops. Great want of Amunition now distress'd The Cornish Army, which prolong'd their rest, And kept 'em back from sitting down before, Those Towns wherein the Rebels lay secure, Till Captain Cart'ret Comptroller of the Kings Navy., by a lucky chance, Came timely thither to relieve their Wants, By must'ring up a Merchandable Store Of Goods in Cornwal, which he wafted o'er To France, and in return supply'd his Friends With all things needful for their present Ends; That spite of all the Rump's successful Toil, They still kept Masters of their native Soil; But, in the int'rim, whilst the Army staid At Tavistock, some Overtures were made By Devon Rebels, tow'rds a Peace, between The Counties, who such bitter Foes had been, A Solemn Protestation thereupon, In the most binding manner, being drawn, For all to take who were impow'r'd to Treat, Before they could in Consultation sit; To which, both sides, with equal hopes, agreed, And did so far in the Affair proceed, That their Debates did in the End produce, For Twenty Days a Satisfact'ry Truce. In which unactive State, 'twixt Peace and War, We'll leave the West and to the North repair. The Senate now declar'd that Treaty void, Held 'twixt the Loyal and the Rebels Side, In Yorkshire, to preserve their County free From Bloodshed, by a firm Neutrality, Which tho' with all Solemnity agreed And ratify'd, was by the vip'rous Breed Of Rebels, broke as soon as they could see A prospect of Success by Perfidy. Nor can the sacred'st Ties oblige that Race To common Justice, who rebel by Grace, And pray to prosper in their Wickedness. However, tho' the Roundheads did propose A great Advantage by their breach of Vows, And Yorkshire Fairfax, and his active Son, With their small Force took here and there a Town, Yet brave Newcastle, by his timely Care, Upon this new revival of the War, Made such a progress, that he soon o'erpower'd The Rebels, and the Northern Parts secur'd, Ranging the Country, fortifying Towns, In spite of Fairfax, Hotham, and their Sons, Chasing the Rebels till they fled in fear To Hull, and gladly took close Quarters there. A Scotch Commander General King, in February. from the Belgick-Shoar, For the King's use, Six Thousand Arms brought o'er, And Landing at the Port, Newcastle, safe, Join'd with the Brave and Loyal Earl thereof, Who sent the welcome Scot protected thence, To York, with all his Weapons of Defence. In the same Month that Pious Royal Dame The Queen, from Holland into England came, And Landed in the Bay of Burlington, With store of Arms and Ammunition: In her Retinue many famous stout Experienc'd Officers for Horse and Foot: The Queen fatigu'd and weary'd with the Sea, Lodg'd in a Merchant's House upon the Key, Where, for some time, Her Majesty remain'd, To have those Goods she wanted brought to Land, But Batten, curs'd with a Rebellious Soul, Of cruel Treachery and Malice full, Vice-Adm'ral to the Senate, having been At Sea, in hopes to intercept the Queen, But disappointed, came the second Day After Her Landing, close into the Bay, With four stout Ships, and fir'd upon the House The Queen had chosen for her soft Repose, Where sev'ral Cross-bar'd Cannon-Shot madeway Quite thro' the Chamber, as in Bed she lay; Who, to avoid the Storm, was forc'd to fly The House, and in the open Meadows lie Behind a Bank, where frighted Majesty For Shelter stay'd, till they made off to Sea. Who but the worst of Villains, in an Age When factious Malice carr'd the keenest Edge, Could crown his Treasons with such impious Rage. From Burlington Newcastle's Earl convey'd The Queen to York, where for a time she staid, Till Brave Montross and Ogleby repair'd From Scotland thither, with a Loyal Guard Of Sixscore Horse, and whither Sir Hugh Cholmley came With Foot Three-hundred to the Royal Dame From Scarbrough, where, till then, he'd held the pow'r, Beneath the Parliament, of Governour, But now revolted from the Rebels side, And to the Royal Cause himself apply'd. Soon after this old Hotham and his Son, In tamp'ring about Hull's Rendition, Were trap'd amidst their Overtures, and sent Toth'Tower, by their Lords the Parliament, Where they remain'd long Pris'ners, and at last Were hang'd by those whose Cause they first embrac'd. A Fate that often punishes the Pride Of Turncoat Rebels, true to neither Side. The Earl of Derby at the King's desire, Took care of Cheshire and of Lancashire, Where he'd sufficient Int'rest to prevent Their being decoy'd to join the Parliament, But thro' Misconduct, and the want of free Obliging Carriage and Activity, So lost his Int'rest, that the Rump, at length, In Lancashire had gain'd so great a Strength, That they surpris'd his Troops, took sev'ral Towns, And strengthen'd 'em with Works and Garisons. In Cheshire all the active leading Men Of both sides, had concluded to maintain A firm Neutrality, as had been done Before in Yorkshire, when the War begun; But the Rump finding that their Int'rest grew Apace in the next County thereunto, Absolv'd their Friends of all the solemn Ties They'd ratify'd, and prompted 'em to rise. Thus any Vows they would for Int'rest make, And for the same thro' any Contracts break. Chester, by Bishop Bridgman and his Son Sir Orlando Bridgman, the great Lawyer. Was kept intirely faithful to the Crown, The last supplying, at his own Expence, The Town, with all things needful for Defence, Which on its firm united Pow'r alone Bravely depended 'thout a Garrison, Till the Rump Party gaining strength so near, And growing absolute in Lancashire, Then the King sent Sir Nich'las Byron down, A bold experienc'd Soldier of Renown, Commission'd to be Col'nel General Of Cheshire, Loyal Shropshire, and withall, To govern Chester, fortify the Town, And place therein an able Garison; Which he perform'd, and did himself deport So well to the King's Friends of e'ery sort, That from North Wales the Gentry daily sent Fresh Succours, to his great Encouragement, That he soon rais'd an unexpected Force Of serviceable Foot, and able Horse, Which, with small loss, he frequently imploy'd, With good Success, against the Rebels Side. The Rump in the mean time possess'd the Town Of Nantwich In Cheshire., by Sir William Bruerton, Who fortify'd the same, that such a Hold Might make the Senates Friends more safe and bold, Each Garison endeav'ring to incline The Country-People to approve and join The diff'rent Causes which themselves advanc'd, And by obliging Measures countenanc'd; But Byron's Prospect, tho' at first so fair, Was clouded soon by stormy Lancashire, Where Men of little Int'rest in the same, Of narrow Fortune, no Repute or Name, Seduc'd that wealthy County to the Good Old Cause, by the meer frenzy of the Crowd, When 'twas at first believ'd that Ten to One Were heartily inclin'd to serve the Throne, But lost, for want of Derby's active Care And Vigilance, to keep 'em as they were. The King however, 'cause he knew him free From the black Sin of Infidelity, Continu'd him Lieutenant, to the great Declension of his own defensive State. Lord Capel now to Shrewsbury went down, Being made Lieutenant Gen'ral, by the Crown, Of Cheshire, Shropshire, and the Northern part Of Wales; all which he govern'd with such Art, That he preserv'd the same from sending forth Recruits to Fairfax Army in the North, Or raising Reinforcements to supply The Earl of Essex 'gainst his Majesty; But factious Warwick, and Northamptonshire, The County and the Town of Leicester, Were by the Rebels so subdu'd, that none Durst shew themselves in favour of the Throne. The Earl of Stamford's Son, the young Lord Grey, I'th' latter County bearing all the sway, Whilst Sir John Gell possest the Shire as well as Town Of Derby, which he made a Garison. And the Lord Brook, whilst living, bore command, In Stafford's County with an awful hand, And kept all lovers of the Royal Cause, In Terror of the Rumps Tyrannick Laws, Till the Brave Col'nel Hastings, who was Son To Stamford's Foe, the Earl of Huntington, At Ashby de la Zouch In Leicestershire. possess'd, a strong Old Seat, that to his Father did belong; Which House he fortify'd and kept by force, In spite of Grey and all his Followers, Till Hastings, by his Interest, at length, To his own Troop had added such a Strength, That he maintain'd sharp Skirmishes with Grey, Wherein he often bravely won the Day: So that at once the Champions carry'd on The publick Quarrel 'twixt the Rump and Throne, And that revengeful Enmity between Their Families, which long had kindled been; Nor did the Col'nel only prove a Bry'r To Grey, and the Rump's Friends in Leic'stershire, But was a Thorn to those that did Rebel In Derby County, under Sir John Gell, Also took several commodious Towns In Staffordshire, and made 'em Garisons. But these were Actions of the former Year, And introduc'd by retrospection here Waller Sir William, last Winter, having won Renown, By taking Chichester, a useful Town, And putting by those Levies which the King Propos'd in Sussex, for the foll'wing Spring, This Year, was early furnish'd with a large Rebellious Army at the Senates Charge, Who with their Matchlocks and their Basket Hilts, Made fatal Work in Monmouthshire and Wilts. And did the Rump much service, by the Sword, I'th' Shire of Gloc'ster and of Hereford, Besieging and subduing sev'ral Towns, Made by the Royal Party Garisons. Which shews the Justice of a Cause is far Too weak a guard against the Chance of War. About the midst of May Upon the 16th. this present Year, There chanc'd a sharp Dispute in Devonshire, At Stratton, where Earl Stamford, with a force Of near Sev'n-thousand Foot, Dragoons, and Horse, And half the Strength commanded by Mohun Lord, Hopton, and other Champions for the Crown, Whose little Cornish Army push'd the Foe So bravely, that they gave an Overthrow To twice the Number posted on a Hill, And on the Spot did many Hundreds kill; Their Major Gen'ral Chudleigh Captive made, The best and bravest Officer they had; And after, by perswasion, brought him o'er, From the Rump Side, to serve the Sov'reign Pow'r, Making their Gen'ral Stamford glad to fly The Dangers of a hard won Victory. At the same time the Rump thought fit to send Essex near Oxford, where the King remain'd, With Orders to disturb and incommode That Garison by all the ways he cou'd, Accordingly he march'd some Troops so near His Sov'reign as to Thame in Oxfordshire, Quart'ring his Roundhead Army close the same, In the adjacent County o' Buckingham, Where numbers of his Men, grew weak and ill, Occasion'd by immod'rate Rains that fell; So that he could not greatly incommode The King, or do the Parliament much good. However, timely Tidings being brought To the King's Ear by a revolted Scot Colonel Urrey, who had serv'd the Rump, but revolted to the King., Where a large Party of the Rebels Horse Were loosely quarter'd, and with half the Force Might be surpriz'd and routed; and that he Himself, to instance his sincerity, Would with a Party go a Voluntier, And shew them where the Horse he mention'd were, Rupert forthwith accordingly assign'd A Strength proportion'd to the others mind, Which Urrey guided thro' a private Way, Toth' straggling Village where the Rebels lay, And beating up their Quarters, crush'd the best Of a whole Regiment, and took the rest, Falling, in their return, upon a place They'd pass'd before, obtaining like Success. Thus Rebels are by Rebels oft betray'd, And cruel Deeds by Cruelty repaid. Urrey, no sooner had perform'd this Point Of his Revenge against the Parliament, By whom he had been us'd with some neglect, Or thought so, which produc'd the same Effect, But to Prince Rupert he propos'd the same Success upon their Quarters close by Thame. The King and Prince well satisfy'd with what Had been already manag'd by the Scot, Approv'd the Hint, and Rupert, out of hand, Prepar'd, and bore himself the chief Command, But with him took the Scot, that he might share The Glory which they hop'd to win and wear. Accordingly the Heroes march'd away From Oxford, on the Eve of Saturday, Moving tow'rds Wickham, Postcomb, Chimer In Oxfordshire., where The Rebels Quarters near their Gen'rals were, And falling in, next London, whence they fear'd No Enemy, and therefore kept no guard. Two Regiments One of Horse, one of Foot. at Wickam they secur'd, Great Numbers took, put others to the Sword, Did then to the next Villages repair, And with the like success proceeded there, Returning from their Sanguinary Toils, With droves of Captives and with loads of Spoils. But Essex had, by this time, been allarm'd, At Thame, that his own Quarters now were arm'd And his best Troops commanded to pursue And Skirmish with the Prince, as he withdrew, Till he himself could follow with the Foot, And hold the En'my to a tough Dispute; Accordingly their best and ready'st Horse March'd forward to o'ertake the Conquerors, And in the Field of Chalgrove came so near As to behold their Adversaries Rear, Just as their Front were moving off the Plain, Into a narrow incommodious Lane, That led unto a distant Bridge that lay Upon a little River in their way. But Rupert finding Essex was in chase Thought it not safe to venture thro' the Pass, Order'd the Pris'ners therefore to be carr'd With speed beyond the River by their Guard, And fac'd about his Troops, once more, to try The Strength of a Superior Enemy, Who, from their Numbers, being sure to win The Day, like Heroes, did the Fight begin; But fiery Rupert, with such angry haste, Return'd their Blows and ply'd the Foe so fast, That from his Rage their broken Troops withdrew And left the Field, tho' Essex was in view; Most of their chief Commanders being slain In the sharp contest on the trampl'd Plain. Hambden, whose factious and prevailing Tongue, As well as Sword, had done his Country wrong, Receiving his Death's Wound See Hambden's Character., where first he'd shown His Duty to the Rump, instead of Throne, Not that he was in Battle kill'd outright But for some Days, in pain, outliv'd the Fight, And might have eas'd his Conscience in distress, But harden'd Rebels seldom have the Grace. Gunter A Major for the Parliament., a valiant Officer of Note, Was also shot, and perish'd on the Spot, Whose Malice to the Church before the War Had brought him to the High-Commission-Bar, Which work'd him up to meditate Revenge, And labour to effect a thorough Change. Sheffield, the Earl of Mulgrave's Younger Son, And Beckly a Scotch Col'nel of Renown, Were taken, but the Wounds they had receiv'd B'ing great, as they affirm'd, and were believ'd, The Prince till their Recov'ry, was so kind To leave 'em both, upon Parole, behind; But, like true Rebels they at once broke through The Law of Arms and that of Honour too. Thus Rupert and the bold revolted Scot, Who both had with undaunted Brav'ry fought, Return'd in Triumph from the Field of Blood, To Oxford safe, by Essex unpursu'd; Tho' when his routed Troops the Battle lost He'd brought his Foot within a Mile at most, Who much affronted that his bravest Horse Had been thus shatter'd by so small a Force, Retir'd to Bristol, hoping he should there Recruit his Army from the Counties near In which great City sev'ral had of late Been try'd and doom'd to that unhappy Fate, The Gallows Mr. Robert Yeomans, late Sherriff of that City, Mr. William his Brother, Mr. George Bourchier, Mr. Edward Dacres, and others of their Friends., for attempting to restore The Town of Bristol to the sov'reign Pow'r. Thus none are safe in a divided Land, Where Parties gain, by turns, the upperhand, And spiteful Justice, without Law or Lord, Is measur'd by the keen revengeful Sword. The Rump for service of their Commonweal, By this time, had prepar'd a new Broad-Seal, Which Forgery both Houses did advance And use, by vertue of an Ordinance. The Queen, that Royal Heroine, having got Together, Seven-thousand Horse and Foot, Now left the North, and Westward march'd to join Her Forces with Her Nuptial Sovereign, Tho' in her Way she prudently took care Of Nottingham and neighb'ring Lincolnshire, Recruiting Col'nel Cavendish, who'd done Great Service in those Counties for the Throne; Was welcom'd, when at Newark upon Trent June 13., With fresh success against the Parliament, By the same Cavendish, who'd overthrown A Party of the Foe at Dunnington In Lincolnshire.. From thence to Burton Majesty repair'd, A Town which had been taken by the Lord Jermine., Who then was honour'd with the chief Command Of all the Force that did the Queen attend, Who mov'd by gentle Marches till she came To Stratford, Avon, where the Royal Dame Was met by Rupert, with a noble shew Of gallant Troops, which he from Oxford drew, Forming, when join'd, a much compleater Host Than Essex, or his Lords the Rump could boast, Which so provok'd 'em that, to shew their Spleen, The Commons with High-Treason charg'd the Queen, And sent up an Impeachment to the Lords, Heighten'd with Malice, in the blackest Words, Alledging, she'd in Holland left in pawn The Jewels appertaining to the Crown, That she'd fomented the Rebellious War, In Ireland, and espous'd the Papists there, That she had us'd her Int'rest, with intent To raise the Scots against the Parliament, And that sh'appear'd in England at the Head Of Popish Forces, and in Triumph led The same, and did from Town to Town advance To awe and terrify the Protestants. To all which Articles the Lords agreed, Who fear'd to flinch from what the Commons did, O despicable Rump! O wretched Times! When Vertues thus were deem'd the blackest Crimes. Waller who in this Int'rim, had obtain'd Success, and wondrous Reputation gain'd, Being now at Bath, and Hertford lying near, With Maurice, Hopton, and that noble Peer Carnarvan, daily Skirmishes arose 'Twixt moving Parties of the neighb'ring Foes. The Western Host b'ing order'd by the Crown, To blast the Laurels Waller's Arms had won, And if they could to stop his growing Pow'r, From Ludlow-Castle and from Worcester; Accordingly the Loyal Heroes nam'd Before, for Conduct and for Courage fam'd, Having, with all their sev'ral Squadrons met At Chard, within the Shire of Somerset, March'd with united Force and took the Towns Of Taunton and Bridgewater, Garisons Of Strength, and Dunstar-Castle did subdue With ease, tho' stronger than the other Two; Were after, in their Quarters, when they lay At Summerton, assaulted e'er 'twas Day, By Strode and Popham, with a rally'd Force Of broken Bands of Foot and Troops of Horse, Which had before at Stratton been repell'd, And under Stamford's Conduct fled the Field, But now resumd their Courage to surprise, E'er Light appear'd, their Sleeping Enemies, Fell on a Dragoon Reg'ment and allarm'd The Royal Host, who in an Instant arm'd, And chas'd the Foe through Wells, who in no ill Condition gain'd the Top of Mendip Hill, Vhither Prince Maurice and the Marquis led Their Army, and from whence the Rebels fled, But did with little Bick'rings entertain Their Foll'wers, till they pass'd into a Lane, Where brave Carnarvan push'd 'em with such Force, That, in the End, he routed all their Horse, Boldly pursuing, with unweary'd Toil, Their vanquish'd flying Troops Mile after Mile, Till, hurry'd by success, he was at length, Decoy'd within the Bounds of Waller's Strength, And in the height of Vict'ry made his way Into those Quarters where the Rebels lay, Where some fresh Squadrons of the Foe, within The Cover of a Hedge, had march'd unseen, To meet their Friends, who join'd them in their flight, And gave them Courage to renew the Fight; That now the Earl retreated full as fast As those he'd follow'd with such eager haste, Dispatching Couriers, upon full carier, T'acquaint Prince Maurice of the Danger near, Who, upon this Intelligence, withdrew Into an open Plain that lay in view, A place commodious for the Prince to meet The Foe, and join the Earl in his Retreat, Who, in a chaff'd Condition, thither brought His shatter'd Troops who had so bravely fought; Where now again the Battle was renew'd, The Foe once more defeated and pursu'd, The Rebels loosing, on the Dusty Plain, Three times the Number of the Victors slain; The Prince and Earl returning o'er the Hills Of Mendip to their Quarters then at Wells, Where they refresh'd, and triumph'd in Success, With their whole Body, for a Fortnights space, Whilst Waller and his Army, fir'd with Wrath, At these Proceedings, Quarter'd at the Bath, Having from London just receiv'd a fierce Tremendous Reg'ment arm'd like Cuirassiers Commanded by Sir Arthur Haslerig., The first that in that Crimson War appear'd, Equip'd in Armour, and were therefore fear'd The more; however, the successful Side, Inspir'd by Vict'ry, with a gallant Pride, Seem'd now impatient, after Ten Days Ease, In open Field to meet their Enemies; Accordingly from Wells their Captains led Their valiant Host to Marsfield, where they staid Till Waller drew his Roundheads out of Bath To Lansdown, an extensive lofty Heath, From whence he sent a Party of his Horse To Marsfield to allarm the Loyal Force, Who beat 'em back and follow'd with their Host, To th'foot of Waller's advantageous Post; But thinking it unsafe t'engage a Foe That stood so high, whilst they remain'd so low, Concluded to retire, until they found The Enemy upon more equal Ground; But Waller apprehensive of their fear, Sent his whole Horse t'attack 'em in the Rear, In which Attempt Sir Arthur's Cuirassiers, Prov'd so amazing to the Cavaliers, That, by the first impression, they were cow'd, With the fierce Courage the Assailants shew'd; Yet by their brave Commanders were they brought, At length, to rally, and so boldly fought, That they amaz'd the Rebels, climb'd the Hill, By Nature almost inaccessible, And beat the Rumps best Champion and his Host, By dint of Sword, from their advantage Post Wednesday, July 5., That they behind a Stony Wall retir'd, From which strong Bulwark of Defence they fir'd Some Ordinance, till kind obliging Night Came on, and put a period to the Fight, The Foe retreating from the Danger nigh, Beneath the Cover of a cloudy Sky, Leaving their lighted Matches stuck in Holes And Crevices, they found about the Walls, That Scouts might be deceiv'd and think they lay In order to engage by break of Day; Which Stratagem the Rebels us'd, for fear The Foe should follow and attack their Rear. Thus ended the Dispute, which Vict'ry cost The Loyal Side the Flower of their Host, Thousands by each being left upon the Plain, And many noted brave Commanders slain, As in their sev'ral Characters appear, And therefore needless to be mention'd here. Waller to Bristol hasten'd to recruit His Army, and refresh his Horse and Foot, Which when he'd done he soon return'd in quest Of Hopton and his Champions of the West, Hoping t'ingage him e'er the King could send Supplies of Powder to his trusty Friend, Which he much wanted, therefore did retire To the Devizes, famous in the Shire Of Wilts, where the brave Hero staid, in hopes Of Succour, till besieg'd by Waller's Troops, Whilst Maurice with the Horse was march'd away To Oxford, where the King in safety lay, Who having heard how Hopton was distress'd Sent Fifteen-hundred Horse into the West Under the Command of Commissary Wilmot., To his Relief, who coming near the Town, Caus'd Waller to withdraw to Roundway-Down, Where both their Troops with equal Rage began A fiery Battle on that spacious Plain; Whilst Hopton from the Town led forth his Foot Whose active Brav'ry sharpen'd the Dispute, And in conclusion gave the Rebel Foe So signal and severe an Overthrow Wednesday July 13., That of Two-thousand Horse there was not one, Except the slain, but what had fled the Down, Tho' back'd with full Three-thousand Foot or more, Dragoons Five-hundred, with sufficient store Of Brass Artill'ry, which became the Spoil Of those that made 'em fly the Downy Hill, In so much fear and haste that many spent Their Lives in plunging down the deep Descent; Whilst routed Waller fled to Bristol Town Despoil'd of all the Laurels he had won; Attended only by a shatter'd Train, In number far inferior to the slain. Kind Providence appointing this Defeat, Upon that very Day the Sov'reign met His Royal Consort in the Field, whereon The King before had Edge-hill Battle won, Who willing, when he heard of this Success, T'improve it to his further Happiness, Sent his Two Nephews, with some Troops of Horse, To join with Hopton and his Western Force, That with resistless Strength they might sit down Before the sturdy Walls of Bristol Town: Which Orders they pursu'd, and in Three Days Became sole Masters of that wealthy Place. The Governour Mr. Nathaniel Fiennes, Son of the Lord Say and Seal., tho' first he made a show Of great Resistance, yielding to the Foe. About this time Carnarvan, in the West, So many Towns and Garisons possess'd, That, by his uncontroll'd Success, the Crown Was Lord of all the Western Counties grown, Newcastle, Norward, had obtain'd the sole Command, and driven Fairfax into Hull, Having first fortunately overthrown His Forces, on the Moor of Adderton. Essex's broken Army were not yet Recruited since their Oxfordshire defeat, Nor had the Rebels any Force to face The King, or stop his March to any place; That now he safely might have made his Way To London, and resum'd the Sov'reign sway, But was, against his Will, advis'd to steer A more destructive course to Glouc'stershire, And with his prosp'rous Army to sit down Before the ancient Walls of Glouc'ster Town, Which Siege the King continu'd till, at length, His much dishearten'd Foes recover'd Strength, And Essex had receiv'd a fresh Recruit From London of stout Horse and able Foot, Whilst the Rump pass'd an Ord'nance, to set forth Full Twenty-thousand Men Under Command of the Earl of Manchester. to aid the North, Till their Scotch Friends, invited to oppose The Crown, were ready to assist their Cause. Aspiring Cromwel, who had been no more Than Captain of a Troop the Year before, And after made a Col'nel, now began To be esteem'd a serviceable Man, Having in these new Levies given great Assistance, also had perform'd of late, In the North-west, such Actions as had rais'd His Fame, and caus'd him to be highly prais'd; Who was the first that took the crafty pains, By preaching, to infuse into the Brains Of the new Army, that for Heaven's sake They fought, and that Religion lay at stake, And he that perish'd in the Cause, by Sword, Dy'd in the Fear and Favour of the Lord, By which he made their conscientious Pride, Balance the Honour of the Loyal Side. Essex from Hounslow, with his new-rais'd Pow'r, Now August 24. march'd tow'rds the Relief of Gloucester, From whence the King advisably withdrew, When Essex was advanc'd almost in view, And left them to relieve the Town he'd lain, Without assault, so long before in vain. Essex now hearing that some Troops with store Of Bread, had lodg'd themselves in Ci'cester, Made a long March from Tewksbury with speed, To rout the Party and supply the Need Of his own Army, who were much distress'd For want of what the Loyal Foe possess'd, Accordingly at midnight he surpris'd The Castle and the Town, wherein he seiz'd Two Regiments of Horse, and Thirty Load Of Stores, the adverse Party there had stow'd, Marching from thence with an intent to pass Thro' Hungerford, but was, on Awburn-Chase; O'erta'en by Rupert, with an able Force, Consisting chiefly of the King's best Horse, Who, charging home, into disorder put The moving Rear of Essex Horse and Foot The Marquis of Vieuville, a gallant French Noble-Man, drop'd in this Action, on the Kings Side. Who, after losing many by the Sword, Cover'd by Night, advanc'd to Hungerford; From whence they march'd to Newbury next Day, Where, with his Army, Charles the Royal lay, To stop the Earl, who meant to steer his course To London, lest diverted thence by force. And now the Rebels, since the adverse Pow'r Had gain'd the Town about Two Hours before, Were greatly disappointed, and compell'd To lodge till Morning in the open Field: Essex advancing by the break of Day, To a high Ground Biggs-Hill., which near to Newb'ry lay, Whither the King, e're Essex gain'd the top O'th' Hill, attack'd him by a Forlorn-Hope, Who with undaunted Warmth began the Fight, Which was with mutual Zeal maintain'd till Night, Beneath whose cover both sides drawing off, Seem'd tacitly to own they had enough, Leaving vast numbers bleeding on the Hill, To fatten and improve the thirsty Soil. The Earl inclining with what haste he cou'd, Tow'rds Reading, which when Rupert understood, With a strong Party, he pursu'd the Foe, Who' thro' a narrow Lane were bound to go, There falling on their Rear, with good success, Cut many off before they pass'd the place, Which rather gave th'advantage, in the main, To the King's Army, by the numbers slain; Tho' both well beaten did alike pretend To Victory, which neither Side had gain'd In this Battle fell the Earls of Carnarvan and Sunderland and the Lord Viscount Falkland. See their Characters.. Essex, as soon as he'd refresh'd a while At Reading, march'd, pursuant to his Will, To London, where the Rump were pleas'd to boast Of Laurels they had neither won nor lost, And in a solemn manner did accord, To thank their Gen'ral first, and next the Lord. The King to Oxford marching, where the Town Proclaim'd, with Joy, a Vict'ry for the Crown. Thus when two Foes have made a doubtful Fight, Both proudly challenge what is neither's Right. The King now finding Reading dispossess'd October 3. O'th' Enemy, in Wisdom thought it best To Garison that Town with such a Pow'r, As made his Royal Quarters more secure. In the mean while, the wealthy Town of Lynn, Seiz'd for the King by th'Norfolk Gentlemen, Hoping the Earl Newcastle would have sent, Or come himself, to their incouragement, Was close besieg'd, and yielded, thro' distress, To Earl of Manchester and Cromwel, in few Days, Whilst Sir John Meldrum, Colonel Lambert, Captain Rainsbrough in the North, From Hull, with two large Bodies, sally'd forth, Fell on Newcastle's Quarters, made him fly, For present safety, into Beverly, His Army also being forc'd to quit The Siege, and from the Walls of Hull retreat. Ireland, which all this time had been distress'd, And by the Rebels e'erywhere oppress'd, For want of Succours, which the Commons-House Converted here to their Rebellious use, Was now reliev'd by Ormond Lieutenant-General of the English Forces., for a Year, From the sharp Conflicts of a bloody War, He having, with the Rebels, for the space Premis'd, agreed Hostility should cease. During this time, Prince Maurice, in the West, Had, by his active Courage, dispossess'd The Foe of many Towns Biddiford, Appleford, Barnstable, Exeter, and Dartmouth., and much advanc'd The King's Condition, and discountenanc'd His Enemies, so far, that tho' the Crown Had suffer'd by not marching up to Town, When Royal Wisdom was misled before That factious fatal City, Gloucester, Yet, in all Parts, the King was thought to be, In strength, superior to the Enemy, Who also now improv'd his Martial Pow'r, By fresh Assistance from the Irish Shore, Receiving thence a well-experienc'd Force Of Foot One-thousand, and a Hundred Horse Under the Command of Sir William St. Leger and Col. Min.; And in a little time Four-thousand more, Of their best Infantry, to Wales came o'er, Who being, much against their own desire, Divided and dispos'd of here and there, Less Service did than if preserv'd intire. It proves the same with e'ery foreign Host, Disperse the Body and the Spirit's lost. The Prince d' Harcourt Made his Entrance at Oxford, Octob. 18. now from France was sent, To mediate 'twixt the King and Parliament, But finding his Efforts were all in vain, After a few Months stay, return'd again. Sir William Waller, since his last Defeat, Having, in London, rais'd a new compleat, Tho' little Army, which Records compute To be, at most, Six-thousand Horse and Foot, Lay ready to march early in the Spring, Against the Western Forces of the King, Who was as thoughtful how he might prevent His Progress, by some shrewd Impediment. The Scots, who with their Friends the Parliament, Had join'd in Solemn League and Covenant, Now In January. enter'd England, as before agreed, Between the Rump and Kirk beyond the Tweed, Writing a crafty Letter From Berwick. in their way, To Loyal Sir Thomas. Glemham, who at Anwick lay, With sixteen Troops, two Regiments of Foot, Commanded all by Officers of Note, Twenty good Ordinance, eight Drakes, and Stores Of all things needful for so small a Force: The Scots declaring 'twas their sole intent To prosecute the Ends o'th' Covenant, For the reforming and establishing Religion, and the Honour of the King, Restoring publick Peace and Liberty, And settling all things as they ought to be. Such taking Cant by which the Scots believ'd Their Friends would be oblig'd, and Fools deceiv'd, Desiring Glemham would vouchsafe to hand The same toth' Gentry of Northumberland. To which the Loyal Knight return'd so fair And fit an Answer by their Trumpeter, That he gain'd time to draw his Forces off From Anwick, and to make himself more safe, By moving with his Ord'nance to the Town, Newcastle, a commodious Garison. The Northern Marquis Of Newcastle, lately so created. now advanc'd to meet The Scots, in hopes to force 'em to retreat, Leaving the Care of York, and of the Shire, And the Command of all the Forces there, To Col'nel Bellasis, whose Failings soon Brought many sudden Mischiefs on the Crown: For the industrious Foe no sooner found That brave Newcastle had forsook his Ground In Yorkshire, and was moving farther North, But they from sev'ral neighb'ring Shires drew forth What Force they could, b'ing resolutely bent To lay close Siege to Newark upon Trent, A Town which had been, and at present was, Of great Importance to the Royal Cause: Therefore the Rebels, when they first sat down Before it, vow'd to make the same their own. Also in this unhappy Juncture, full Of evil Prospects, Sir Thomas Fairfax, out of Hull, Drew a strong Party, and at Selby, near To York, when Bellasis was quarter'd there, Surpriz'd him in the Town, and, to his great Dishonour, gave him a severe Defeat, Took many Pris'ners, some of high Degree, Nor did himself escape Captivity; Carr'd off his Cannon also from the Place, With all the Marks and Ensigns of Success. Which unexpected fatal Overthrow, To York itself was such a frightful Blow, That Brave Newcastle, who had stop'd the way The Scots propos'd, and kept 'em at a Bay, Now thought it Wisdom to withdraw his Force, And for York City change his Norward Course, Lest Fairfax should improve the great Defeat He'd giv'n, and make his Vict'ry more compleat. Which was his first Success that ever wrought Upon the Minds of those for whom he fought. The King concern'd at Newark Siege, a Town Of mighty use and service to the Crown, Sent Fiery Rupert to relieve the same, Whose Name a Terror struck where'er he came. According to his Orders, he pursu'd The Noble Task with all the speed he cou'd, And with a Force inferior to the Foe, Such Wonders did that few Records can show, Beat 'em from all their Works, their Trenches scow'rd, And made 'em feel the Fury of his Sword, Push'd 'em, by dint of Blows, from place to place, With such impatient Brav'ry and Success, That they, at length, submitted upon Terms, Of giving up their Baggage and their Arms, And to depart without, which gracious Leave The Prince, with Battle tir'd, vouchsaf'd to give. Thus beat the Rebels and reliev'd the Town, To his eternal Honour and Renown, For no one Action, brighten'd with Success, Throughout the War, was thought more great than this. The End of the Nineteenth Year. THE Lord Hopton's CHARACTER. Born in South-Wales, and, as some Writers say, No sooner could he speak but he could pray, And that all common Chararacters he read Distinctly true as early as he pray'd, Proving, before his Years were fully Three, A Miracle beyond credulity; Twixt Four and Five, Six-hundred Words could speak Of Latin, and that full-mouth'd Language Greek, Their Genders and Declensions justly give, And do those things that few would now believe. At riper Years he was to Oxford sent, And there some time in Lincoln-College spent, Tutor'd by Sanderson, that pious Guide, Who, after, Lincoln Bishoprick supply'd. From thence the Youth had to the Camp recourse, Where he was soon made Officer of Horse, And, in a little time, appear'd as skill'd In Arms as the best Hero in the Field, Run thro' as many Dangers with Success, Till Fortune did, at length, the Foe embrace, Who, under Waller's Conduct, gave the Lord A resolute Defeat at Alresford. Yet, in a little time, was Gen'ral made Of all the Western Forces, which he led To Torrington, where he receiv'd a Blow, That prov'd his cow'rdly Army's overthrow, Who fled from Fairfax shamefully, and left Their Gen'ral, wounded with a Pike, to shift: Nor would they upon further Action go, But treated with the base rebellious Foe. Thus was the Western Force at once dissolv'd, The Lord forsaken, wounded, and involv'd In Cares and Dangers he for Years surviv'd, And with the Royal Son in Exile liv'd, Dying at Bruges, e're he joy'd to see That happy Day, that set the Kingdom free From Slav'ry and rebellious Tyranny. No mortal Worthy treasur'd in his Breast More Honour, or more Loyalty profess'd; None better fortify'd against Disgrace, And all temptations to be false and base, Enjoy'd an Understanding sound and clear, And stedfast Courage, proud to persevere In a just Cause, and if he chanc'd to fail Of any Vertue in a General, 'Twas when he call'd a Council, to confer About some present Exigence of War, For then he would be tedious in Debate, Which sometimes render'd things unfortunate, And falling from the Measures they'd agreed, Would, by new Schemes, their urgent haste impede, Was therefore thought, by some, more fit to bear The second, than the first, Command in War. But who, alas, tho' ne'er so Wise and Great, Escapes Reflection, if unfortunate. England does always, to her open shame, The Just and Brave for Disappointments blame, And labours to support the prosp'rous Villain's Fams. THE Earl of Sunderland's CHARACTER. A valiant Noble Peer, whose gen'rous Breast Was early with heroick Vertues blest; Nature with Wonders had his Soul inspir'd, And all that Art could furnish he'd acquir'd: To which great Gifts and Graces of the Mind, A lib'ral Fortune, by Descent, was join'd. With these Accomplishments the gallant Youth, Confirm'd in Honour, Loyalty, and Truth, Set forth into the World, at scarce the Age Of Man, to act upon the Publick Stage, And fond, in an ill season, to express His Duty to his Sov'reign in Distress, Attended, only as a Voluntier, His Royal Person, in the heat of War; And at the second Fight, near Newb'ry Town, Before the Troop he mounted in fell on, A Cannon-Bullet snatch'd his Life away, And to the Surface crush'd his bleeding Clay. Thus the brave Youth, in one short space, appear'd Lively and gay, and mangl'd and besmear'd. Hard Fate! a Plant so Noble, that had stood Twenty-three Years the Wonder of the Wood, But humane Nature has, alas, no fence Against the turns of Chance or Providence. Nor can the Heav'nly Sciences foreshow, Or Wisdom, by its utmost searches, know, Why, where, or when we shall receive the Blow. THE Earl of Carnarvan's CHARACTER. A man by Nature of a curious Mind, To Knowledge and to Action much inclin'd, Possess'd with Vertues equal to his Birth, Wanting no Parts that could enhance his Worth; And by long foreign Travels, which he lov'd, His Education largely had improv'd, Paris and Madrid he alike had view'd, And glean'd from both what he esteem'd as good; Th'Italian Garden of the World had seen, And o'er the Seven Roman Hills had been, Survey'd that noble old Imperial Town, Once the World's Mistress, now with Priest's o'er-run Thro' the Turks Empire also he had pass'd, And travel'd divers Regions in the East, Finding, where'er he came, some diff'rent Arts, Or new advantage to improve his Parts Fraught with this vast Experience he had gain'd Abroad, return'd into his Native Land, Where the accomplish'd Noble Peer was known Too little, e'er the Civil Wars begun; Delighting chiefly in those Rural Sports, Admir'd by such as fly from Princes Courts, Till the King made him, in his first rais'd Force, Commander of a Regiment of Horse; And then, at once, he totally resign'd His Pleasures, and to Arms apply'd his Mind, That no Man with a more consid'rate Head Commanded, or more punctually obey'd: Nor was he only happy in a keen Undaunted Courage above other Men, But none discern'd with quicker Eyes than he, Advantages against an Enemy, Or with more Warmth pursu'd the same as far As 'twas consistent with the Rules of War, Having, in sev'ral Battles plaid his part, And not alone his Courage shew'd, but Art: Nor did he want a present Mind to steer The safest Course, when Danger happen'd near, A Gift of wondrous benefit to those Who in the Martial Plain contend with Foes. Justice he lov'd, and practis'd it among Those Persons most that he had Pow'r to wrong, Scorning that License some Commanders thought No Crime, or in a Soldier scarce a Fau't, Having so strict and punctual a regard To all the Rules of Honour and his Word, That when he found it was not in his Pow'r To make his Promise good to Dorchester And Weymouth, nothing could perswade his stay In the West Country, where his Reg'ment lay. But all these Christian Vertues were no shield Of safety in Death's Slaughter-house, the Field, For having charg'd with bold successful force, A larger Body of the Rebels Horse, At Newb'ry Fight, and put 'em to the Rout, The Earl, in his return from the Pursuit, Was by a scatter'd Roundhead Trooper known, And, by the Villain, thro' the Body run, Of which invidious Wound, within an Hour, The Hero dy'd, who had so oft before Defy'd the Pow'r of Death in open Plain, Where Crowds with flying Thunderbolts were slain. Thus Fate, in Battle, no distinction makes Between the best of Men and worst of Rakes; Both, if alike expos'd where Bullets fly, Have but an equal Chance to live or die. THE CHARACTER OF Sir John Banks. Nurs'd in the briary Lab'rinth of the Laws, Where some are fleec'd, whilst others win the Cause In which precarious Maze the Pleader toil'd, And fairly practis'd with a Fame unsoil'd, Till made Attorny-Gen'ral, at a time When to be Just and Loyal was a Crime, And when the factious Commons look'd awry In all that truly serv'd His Majesty, And by their noisy Numbers and their Threats O'eraw'd the Men of Worth in all Debates, That Banks, desirous to avoid the Storm, Which he perceiv'd was growing still more warm, Sly Favour climb'd into the Common-Pleas, And sate Chief-Justice there, much more at ease, Where he each knotty Cause and Contest try'd So well, that he offended neither Side. But when the Factious Tribe would have remov'd Some other Judges, whom they disapprov'd, They nam'd his Lordship as a Person fit To be continu'd in the Judgment-seat; Which special Favour caus'd the jealous Court, Not to esteem the Judge the better for't. However, when the fatal Breach was grown More wide betwixt the Parliament and Throne, He was of those who to the King adher'd, And with his Friends at Oxon Town appear'd, Whilst his Heroick Lady did defend His Country-House, Corfe-Castle, and maintain'd Her Seat against that Rebel, to his shame, Sir Walter Earl, who long besieg'd the same, And was at last oblig'd, without Success, To draw his Forces off and quit the Place. Thus does the Justice of a Cause inspire The weak and fearful with courageous Fire. And strengthens Vertue, bravely to despise Those Dangers which the cow'rdly Spirit flies. Sir Peter Wych's CHARACTER. A man of Worth and Honour, who before The Troubles, had been sent Embassador To Turkey, and about the time return'd From thence, when England her Distractions mourn'd, And b'ing at home desirous to support A Loyal Int'rest in the Royal Court, Gave to Sir Thomas Jermin, who controll'd The Houshold, an engaging Sum of Gold, For his white Staff, which wisely he resign'd, To ease th'Ambition of Sir Peter's Mind; Who also by his Station had, in course, A Place among the Privy Counsellors, Which purchas'd Honours he, alas, enjoy'd Not long, e'er he declin'd in Health and dy'd, Always accounted by the World a plain, Ingenuous, sober, downright, honest Man, A Christian blooming Character that few Deserve, tho' many do pretend thereto, Especially such Persons as have drawn The Subtil Air that's breath'd about a Throne. For where politer Craft is only found The Spring that drives their Machinations round, 'Tis hard to see Men flourish by Deceit, And not endeavour to become as great As others, by consenting to the Cheat. A.D. 1644. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Twentieth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1644. The Roundheads hearing of the great Defeat At Newark, by the Prince, were glad to quit, For present Safety, the important Towns Of Gainsbrough, Lincoln, Sleeford, Garisons, Whilst Sir Gilbert Gerard did in Stafford County bring Sterne-Castle in Subjection to the King; But the Scotch Army having pass'd the Tine, And moving forward with intent to join Their English Friends, were by Newcastle met At Hilton, where they toil'd in Blood and Sweat, Till the Kings Troops, by numbers overborn Gave up those Laurels they so long had worn March 25., Yet with such gallant Resolution fought, That the Scotch Vict'ry was but dearly bought. Waller by this time having steer'd his Course So far as Sussex with his new-rais'd Force, And taken Ar'ndel-Castle in his way Which, to advantage, near the Ocean lay, From thence march'd into Hampshire, where he met With Hopton, who had there been fortunate, On Brandon-Heath a hot Dispute arose Between the Loyal and Disloyal Foes, Where Waller, by the Courage of his Host March 30. Redeem'd the Credit he before had lost, Tho' Hopton carry'd off, in his Retreat, Most of his Cannon, after the Defeat. Oxford now apprehensive of a Siege April 17., The Queen, b'ing pregnant, left her Sov'reign Liege, And did with safety, unsurpriz'd, retire From thence to th'Garison of Exeter; The King proroguing, when the Queen was gone, His Parliamentary Convention, Made up of Members, who had left the House Of Lords, and daring Commons, to espouse Their injur'd Sov'reign and his Royal Cause, Oppos'd unjustly 'gainst the Nations Laws. Rupert in Shropshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, As well as in the Shire of Lancaster, From the Rump side had taken many Towns, And forc'd them out of Holds and Garisons, Relieving Latham-House, which for the Crown, By Derby's Countess, to her great Renown, Was held against a Siege, for Eighteen Weeks, An Action that alone so largely speaks Her Vertues, that the Gallant Lady needs No praise, but a recital of her Deeds. Therefore the Prince, obtaining this Success, Was now industrious in those Parts to raise An Army, able to sustain the Great Newcastle, weaken'd by his Scotch Defeat, Where we shall leave the Hero to improve His Fortune and from North to West remove. Essex and Waller now thought fit to join, At Blewb'ry In Berkshire, May 24., to pursue the Rumps Design Of laying Siege to Oxford, which the Crown Had been some time appriz'd of, e'er begun. After the Heroes had a while confer'd, And settl'd Matters as themselves desir'd, Essex to Islip did his Army lead To straiten Oxford on the Norward side, Whilst Waller mov'd to th'Southward of the Town, And took his Quarters up at Abington; But the consid'rate King no sooner sound That he was like to be beleaguer'd round, But ord'ring all his Troops in readiness To march tow'rds Worc'ster, to avoid Distress, He sent the Earl of Cleaveland with a Force, Consisting of about Six-hundred Horse, To allarm Abbington, where Waller lay, Whilst he himself withdrew another way, With a small Host, whose number was about Sev'n Thousand well experienc'd Horse and Foot, Which wise Heroick Charles conducted clear And unmolested into Worcester, Gaining full Eighteen Hours, before 'twas known To either Army, he had left the Town, That tho' they both pursu'd, the King maintain'd His Distance, and his Point with safety gain'd. Essex, soon weary of his fruitless Chase, Encourag'd by no prospect of Success, Withheld his Speed at Burford, where he lay Till Waller thither came, a diff'rent way, Where 'twas agreed the latter should attend The King, whilst Essex did his Forces bend Towards the Western Counties, with intent To force Obedience to the Parliament; Accordingly they parted, and pursu'd Their diff'rent Measures with what care they cou'd, Waller endeav'ring in his March to raise More Forces, which occasion'd such Delays, That a strong Party by the King was sent To Dudly-Castle, when the Parliament Adherents had almost reduc'd the same, For want of such Relief as timely came June 17. The King now march'd to Budely, which inclin'd Waller more Norward than he first design'd, Believing 'twas His Majesty's Intent, To join Newcastle, which he never meant; For when he found Sir William and his Pow'r Beyond him, he return'd to Worcester; From thence remov'd to Witney June 18., where he staid Till he receiv'd from Oxford further Aid, Waller inclining with his Host that way, Where e'er he heard the Royal Forces lay, Till both the Armies met, and near the Bridge Of Cropredy disputed Edge to Edge; Both sides contending with unweary'd Zeal Involv'd in Lightning, fed by clashing Steel, Till Fortune, after they for Hours had try'd The Cause in Blood, deceiv'd the Rebels Pride, And gave the Vict'ry to the Royal Side. The King thus having gain'd this mighty Point, Desir'd a Treaty with the Parliament, But all his kind advances tow'rds a Peace, Were still obstructed by his Enemies, That now the Royal Hero thought it best To follow Essex, active in the West; In which Pursuit we'll leave him, to repair Into the North, to treat of Actions there. Prince Rupert, fam'd for sanguinary Work, From Lancashire now led his Troops tow'rd York, Where brave Newcastle full two Months had been Besieg'd, and straiten'd for Relief within, Begirt by three strong Hosts, beneath the Pow'r Of Fairfax, Lesly, and of Manchester, Who had no sooner notice, by their Spies, Of Rupert's near approach, but, in surprise, They drew their Armies off, the Siege gave o'er, And join'd their Forces upon Marston-Moor, Whilst Rupert sent to th'Marquis in the Town, To sally forth with all his Garison; Which being done, the brave Bohemian Lord Attack'd the Enemy with Fire and Sword, And with his Squadrons such Impression made Upon the Scots, that all their Army fled, And throwing down their Arms, to be more light, Did with their Gen'ral fly Ten Miles outright See Lesly's Character.. Yet, after this, bold Cromwel's sturdy Horse With Fairfax join'd, push'd on with so much force, That in the End they gratify'd their Pride, For want of Conduct in the Loyal Side, And gain'd a cloudy Victory, which cost The Foe more Blood than Rupert's Army lost, Yet gave so deep a Wound to Sov'reign Pow'r, That clos'd and gangreen'd till 'twas past a Cure. Newcastle, after he had bravely fought, Flying with many Officers of Note, From York to Scarbrough, where they Shipping took, And full of Grief their native Soil forsook, Whilst Rupert, vex'd he should the Battle lose, With wither'd Laurels on his sullen Brows, Did, with his broken Troops and Bands, retire Into his prosp'rous County Lancashire, And left the Rebels to renew their Siege, Who did in less than Thirteen Days oblige The Town to a Surrender July 16., upon Terms, Accounted Hon'rable by Men of Arms. Thus as Misfortunes seldom rain but pour, So one Success is parent still of more. The Queen who in the Month of June 2d. before, Had been deliver'd safe at Exeter, Of a fair Princess Henrietta now departed thence, And cross'd the Seas to Britany in France, Tho' some Rebellious Ships that hov'ring lay To intercept the Heroin in her way, Made at her Bark, as sailing o'er the Main, Above a Hundred Cannon Shot in vain, Kind Providence protecting the Distress'd And frighted Vertuous Lady safe to Brest. Greenvil Sir Richard, who'd undertaken to subdue The Town of Plymouth, for the King, withdrew His Forces from the Siege, upon the Fame That Essex was approaching tow'rds the same, Who hearing the Besiegers were withdrawn, Instead of marching to relieve the Town, Mov'd into Cornwal, where the King, to try The Bent of his revolted Enemy, Sent him a Letter Dated August 6 to invite him o'er, From his Rump Friends, to join the Sov'reign Pow'r, Which the Lord Beauchamp Nephew to Essex. to the Earl convey'd, Who, tho' he read the same, no Answer made. Soon after this the King's Commanders join'd And sent the Earl a Letter they had Sign'd, Desiring he'd vouchsafe to treat of Peace, That Discord and destructive War might cease, To which he made a Negative Reply, Importing their Request was of so high A Nature, that he had not Pow'r to do What they so earnestly had press'd him to. Thus the best Vertue eas'ly is betray'd But hard to be restrain'd when once misled. Soon after this the King, who now had join'd Maurice, according to his Royal Mind, Block'd Essex up in Cornwal near St. Blase, And there reduc'd him into great Distress, That Sir William Belfour was oblig'd to steal away, With near Three-thousand Horse before 'twas Day August 31., By which their Troops could only be preserv'd From being taken Pris'ners, Kill'd, or Starv'd, Whilst Essex fled to Plymouth in a Boat, And to the Royal Mercy left his Foot, Who gain'd such Terms that they should all go free, Without Arms, Waggons, or Artillery September 2.; So that the Monarch strip'd his Foes at once, Of Forty-nine Brass heavy Ordinance. Two-hundred and odd Barrels of that curs'd Destructive Blast the Monk invented first; With Ropes of Match, the Sulphur to inflame, And Killing Ball proportion'd to the same; Sev'n-hundred Carriages, and more than twice Four-thousand Arms were also made free Prize: But all these vast Successes prov'd no more Than Fortunes flatt'ries to the Royal Pow'r. By this great Vict'ry sev'ral Towns were won, Which had before rebell'd against the Throne, And Basing-House The Seat of the Marquis of Winchester, and by him defended. which had endur'd a Siege For Eighteen Weeks, was now reliev'd by Sir Henry Gage, Who also forc'd the Foe with loss to run, From Banb'ry Castle, where they'd long sate down, But this Success was in the main destroy'd, And overballanc'd by the Rebels Side, For in this time they'd taken from the Crown The Castle of Newcastle, and the Town, By Storm, subduing Monmouth in the West, Also the Port of Liverpool possess'd. Essex recov'ring strength now October 23. join'd his Force With Waller's Army and with Manchester's, In Aldermaston-Park, and march'd from thence To Newbury against the King and Prince Maurice. Where, for some Days, they Skirmish'd, till, at length, Both sides in Battle join'd their total strength: In which unhappy Fight, where heaps were slain, The prosp'rous Rebels did the better gain, The King retreating, when the Night came on, With secresy, to th'Castle o' Dunnington. Wherein, to expedite his march from thence, He lodg'd the heavi'st of his Ordinance, And hasten'd on to Wallingford, in hopes, From Oxford, to recruit his broken Troops; Whilst th'Enemy at Newb'ry made a hault, Whence Essex sent a Party to assault The Castle, where the King's Artil'ry Train Were left, but they attempted it in vain, And after carry'd on a Siege, in form, That prov'd as ineffectual as their Storm. During which time, the Generals disjoin'd Their sev'ral Hosts, and diff'rent ways inclin'd. The King returning, when the Foe was drawn From Newb'ry, to th'Relief of Dunnington; At whose approach the Rebels rais'd their Siege, And fled the Justice of their injur'd Liege, Who now reliev'd the Castle and drew out His Ordinance, thence marching in pursuit of Waller, who His Majesty had heard, Was with his Army near to Hungerford; But when the King approach'd him, with design To fight, the Foe would not in Battle join, But did all Opportunities decline: So that the King once more commanding Gage To Basing House, whose appearance rais'd the Siege, Return'd to Oxford, that his weary'd Host Might into Winter Quarters be dispos'd. But tho' the Season was unfit for War, And the cold Rains sufficient to deter Both sides from Action, yet, in sev'ral Parts, Zeal and Revenge so warm'd the Soldiers Hearts, That many fatal Bickerings arose, 'Twixt moving Parties of the spiteful Foes, And divers Towns new Garisons were made, Which on the neighb'ring Country rudely prey'd, And made the toiling Farmer loudly groan, Beneath the Mis'ries of Rebellion, A Curse that never fails, where'er 'tis spread, To punish Nations where the Monster's bred. In Justice they the most deserve to feel The Edge, who love to grind the piercing Stee;l And they that set their Country in a flame, Should be the first that perish in the same; For War, that bloody Scene, should never be So much our Choice as our Necessity. The End of the Twentieth Year. Prince Ruperts CHARACTER. A gallant Heroe, Nephew to the Throne, Call'd to this Country when he'd lost his own, To save his pious Uncle, in the Days Of Blood and Ruin, from the like Distress. For could the World afford a Braver Prince, More fit to scourge Rebellious Insolence, For his undaunted Soul was truly clear Of all those Visions that arise from Fear, And in the Field confound the Coward's Head, With far worse Objects than he's cause to dread, Boldly pursuing rather his Desire Of Glory, with excess of Martial Fire, Which in some Actions render'd his Success, For want of more delib'rate Thoughts, the less; But his impatient Warmth could ne'er endure A Foe, tho' strengthen'd with superior Pow'r, Long in his sight, but he would Fate defy, And push, in spite of Odds, for Victory. Therefore the Rebels, like a fainting Race Of Cowards, trembl'd when they saw his Face, Knowing the Field wherein he drew his Sword, With Blood and Sweat must quickly be manur'd, Flinching at no time from a stronger Foe, But always press'd for the deciding Blow, Thinking 'twas less dishonour to be beat By Odds, than without Action to retreat. His first Command was General of the Horse, Which Post was giv'n him early in the Wars, A Trust he well deserv'd, and well imploy'd, Won many Battles, Rebel Heaps destroy'd, Took divers Towns and sundry Towns reliev'd, Amidst their Suff'rings, when by Want aggreiv'd, Yet after all his great Successes, lost Two fatal Battles Marston-Moor, and Naseby., which intirely cost The King his Crown not only, but his Head, For which high Stakes the wicked Game was plaid, Who also in both Bloody Actions shar'd The Danger, tho' his Fortune prov'd so hard: But that which most eclips'd his Nephew's Fame, And shaded all his Laurels to his Shame, Was his too early giving up the Town Of Bristol, to the ruin of the Crown, After he'd firmly promis'd to secure The same, for Months, against the Rebels Pow'r, Yet, in few Days, without the King's Consent, Foully surrender'd to the Parliament, When he had all things needful to've withstood A longer Siege, without the loss of Blood; Nor was there any Mutiny on foot Within, to make him yield to those without; Which Act of Indiscretion so perplex'd The King, and all the Loyal Party vex'd, That Majesty, o'erpower'd with angry Heat, Forthwith a sharp upbraiding Letter writ, In which Express the King at once destroy'd All the Commissions which the Prince enjoy'd, Sending a Pass, and bidding him prepare To seek Subsistence, if he pleas'd, elsewhere. The Prince, however, after all these great Resentments, was intrusted with the Fleet, Riding Lord Adm'ral o'er the clashing Main, To jarring Ireland, and from thence to Spain; Did also into Lisbon River go, Took many Prizes from the Rebel Foe, But render'd all his fortunate Encrease Of Treasure, to the fierce tempestuous Seas, Where the rude Winds and Waves conspir'd to drown Two able Ships, and all the Crew of one, With whom the Prince's Brother had resort To angry Neptune, and his wealthy Court, Himself escaping with the rest to Nantz, That celebrated Brandy-Port of France, Giving a blind Account of all his past Success, which Fortune had destroy'd at last, Returning only to the Prince of Wales, A Fleet of shatter'd Hulls and shiver'd Sails; And when he found that all Endeavours fail'd, As if the Fates turn'd Roundheads and Rebell'd, He took his leave, 'twixt Honour and Disgrace, And left his injur'd Uncle in Distress, Returning after with the Royal Son, To share the Affluence of a peaceful Throne, Forsaking Martial Dangers for the sport Of wanton Venus in a Lushious Court, Where Love an Beauty strove to make amends For the past Toils of War and loss of Friends. So when cold Winters stormy Winds and Rains Have chill'd the naked Earth, and numb'd our Veins, The Spring succeeds, and at her kind return, Rewards the tedious hardships we have born. THE CHARACTER OF Prince Maurice. A noble Active Prince, of Courage great, Who with his Brother shar'd a banish'd Fate, And to his Royal Uncle had recourse, To serve him, when oppress'd by open Force; Which the puissant Hero, soon as arm'd, With great Success and Gallantry perform'd, Joining the Earl Carnarvan in the West, Where he the Rebels often bravely fac'd, And seldom fail'd to give them a Defeat, Where'er he did their envious Forces meet, In his brisk Charges sev'ral Wounds receiv'd, Yet fought with Courage scarce to be believ'd, And by the dint of Brav'ry did confound Superior Numbers on advantage Ground; At Lansdown-Fight made Waller fly the Field, Where num'rous Worthies on the spot were kill'd; Laid Siege to Exeter, subdu'd the same, Invested Dartmouth, took it, to his Fame, Attempted Plymouth, but sat down too late, When she'd augmented her defensive State. But after all the Battles he had won, And Risques he in the doubtful Field had run, When's fiery Brother had the sole Command O'th' Fleet, he left the service of the Land T'attend the Dangers of the clashing Seas, Where the proud Winds so oft turn Enemies, And there a sudden Storm at once o'ercome The young unhappy Hero in his Bloom, And made the rowling Waves his moving Tomb. Who then for Glory in the Field would strive, Or brave the Seas that swallow Crowds alive, Since all the Fame that we desire to boast, When gain'd, is in one fatal Moment lost. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Bevil Greenvil. Among the Loyal memorable Train Of Worthies, in the Field of Battle slain, None with more Honour bore a nobler share Than Greenvil, in that Sanguinary War, Wherein the Brave and Just too often far'd, In a good Cause, unfortunately hard; Nor could the greatest Hero near the Throne, Oblig'd by large Dependencies thereon, Assist his Sov'reign with a Heart more free, Or full of true unshaken Loyalty, Whose Int'rest, great Activity, and Zeal, He wisely manag'd so intirely well, That all the Forces rais'd, and Service done In Cornwal, were ascrib'd to him alone. His Temper proving so divinely sweet, And his Affections to the Throne so great, That when wrong Measures, Rashness, or Neglect In the Chief Leaders, had an ill effect, He'd ne'er reflect upon the Fault, but bear The worst Misfortunes with a chearful Air, And by exemplar Patience, Love, and Peace, Keep others from resenting things amiss, Uniting to his Courage in the Field, A Disposition so sincerely mild, That, thro' his Service, render'd him to all, Kind, Friendly, Innocent, and Affable; But as the Best and Bravest often stoop To Fate, too early, and the soonest drop, So Greenvil in the Lansdown Battle fell, Where he such Wonders did, and fought so well, That after he had valiantly sustain'd Four sharp Repulses, and had bravely gain'd The Hill, in spite of a superior Force Of Waller's bold Rebellious Foot and Horse, Before their roaring Batt'ries, by a stand Of his own Pikes, he still his Ground maintain'd, Till by a Musquet-Shot that reach'd his Breast, He drop'd, lamented greatly by the rest, Who much enrag'd, to see the Hero die, Reveng'd his Fall and made the Rebels fly; Oxford bestowing on the Hero's Hearse A mourning Volume of Elegiack Verse, An Honour which the Poets justly pay To the surviving Soul that quits such worthy Clay. THE Lord Goring's CHARACTER. First serv'd the King as Col'nel in the Wars, Who after made him Gen'ral of his Horse, When Rupert had the same Command declin'd, And his Commission to the King resign'd, Goring, tho' vicious, being thought by most An able Soldier, equal to the Post, Wanting no Fortitude or spritely Parts, But by hard drinking lessen'd his Deserts; Nor could the greatest Bus'ness disincline His Heart from the perpetual lust of Wine; Or would the thirsty Hero in the face Of Danger be enjoin'd to baulk his Glass, But when by Foes surrounded took his Draught, And, like a Dutchman, drank before he fought; No man commanding more facetious Wit, To render him for Bottle-Converse fit, Which made him lov'd of all that drown'd their Cares In Wine, and homag'd Bacchus more than Mars; Nor was the Love or Friendship he profess'd, More lasting than the Vapours that possest His Brains, for none had less regard than he To Justice, Honour, or Integrity; No Man Dissembling with a better Grace, Or was, in truth, more Fawning or more Base, That ev'n his nearest Friends, who knew his Vice, Were well content to be deceiv'd but Twice, For he'd Ambition, Courage, Wit, and Pride, So near to that of Lucifer's ally'd, And was like him alone in all too vain, To be controll'd by fear of God or Man, That had his slow Industry been as great As his Craft, Levity, and vile Deceit, None could more nicely qualify'd have been, To've acted in the most audacious Scene, Or could have justly hop'd for more Success In the most black and daring Wickedness, An cast, in truth, as Men more honest thought, And Odium on the Cause wherein he fought. So when notorious Witnesses appear, To make the matter in debate more clear, Their wicked Lives induce the standers-by, To scandalize the Side they justify. A.D. 1645. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Twenty-first Year of the Reign of King Charees the First, Anno Dom. 1645. The King at Oxford had not long remain'd, Before the Crafty Rump vouchsaf'd to send Commissioners, in order to address His Majesty, with Overtures of Peace, Which, in the end, at Uxbridge did produce A Treaty Agreed upon in January, but not begun till February., tho' it prov'd of little use, For all their Aim was to usurp the Rule, And make the Sov'reign Prince their servile Tool, Slighting the fair Proposals of the Throne; Nor would th'abate one Tittle of their own; But Royal Wisdom was too just to grant Terms so rebellious and extravagant, And rather would on Providence rely For Safety, than betray Posterity. Archbishop Laud, who in the Tow'r had lain, Four wretched Years, was now in Triumph slain, Who, with his long Confinement teaz'd and tir'd, Look'd like a Ghost, and like a Saint expir'd January 10.. The Rump soon after form'd a Martial Court About the latter end of February., To try false Friends suspected to desert Their Int'rest, also others they'd confin'd, For being to the Loyal Cause inclin'd, Carew, the Gov'nor of St Nich'las Isle, They doom'd to loose his Head on Tower-Hill, For some Attempts that he had made to yield The Place he for the Rump some time had held. Egham and his unhappy Son were both Condemn'd, and hang'd for the like breach of Troth; And that L' Estrange, whose Memory still shines Among the Loyal, in his golden Lines, Having by Leman and by Haggar Trusted with the Affair under solemn Oaths of Secresy. been Safely betray'd about reducing Lynn, By the same Court, unheard, was doom'd to feel Their Vengeance, but by making his Appeal, The Lords, in order that their House might give A timely hearing, granted a Reprieve; But no Proceedings being further made, The Loyal Convict, after he had staid About Four Years in Newgate, did prevail, By trusty Friends, to get discharg'd of Jayl. Next to the Uxbridge Treaty, which had been For Twenty Days continu'd but in vain, Shrewsb'ry was taken by the Rump, a Town Whose sudden loss prov'd fatal to the Crown, And cut off all the Intercourse between North-Wales and their unhappy Sovereign, Stop'd an Association To stand by the King, &amp;c. that was near Concluded, 'twixt the Shires of Worcester, Flint, Salop, Chester, and produc'd a turn That gave the Royal Hero much concern; Sir Alexander But Sir Marmaduke Langdale, in return of what the Foe Had won, gave A Rump Colonel. Rossiter an Overthrow, Near Melton-Mowbray, as he pass'd that way Tow'rds Pomfret-Castle, where the Rebels lay With Fairfax, unto whom he also gave A great Defeat, and did the Castle save In the beginning of March.; Which almost counterpois'd the Foes Success, And made the King's Misfortunes seem the less, Who now thought fit to send his Royal Heir, Accompany'd by Sir Edward Hyde and [illeg.] Colepepper, To perfect the Association, Which in the West had been last Year begun, That all those Counties might be more secure, And the King strengthen'd with a greater Pow'r. The Parliament now murm'ring at their small Success, grew jealous of their General Essex., And that they might remove him from his Post The better, without giving him Disgust, They pass'd a self-denying Ordinance, Whereby all Members were oblig'd at once To give up their Commissions, and no more To act in any military Pow'r, Except Three Fav'rites Cromwel, Ireton, and Major General Sk[illeg.], who excepted were, For their good Service and their trusty Care: In due Obedience to which Law, the Four Disloyal Earls of Essex, Manchester, Warwick, and Derby, to the House of Lords, Gave their Commissions up, and sheath'd their Sword Sir Thomas Fairfax b'ing now thought worthy, above all Their Friends, to be their trusty General. Cromwel, whose Merit claim'd the next great Post, B'ing made Lieutenant of the stiffneck'd Host. When thus the Rebel Army were reform'd, And their proud Leaders by Advancement warm'd, Fairfax at Windsor rendesvouz'd his Force, Whence Cromwel march'd with a Brigade of Horse, To intercept a Convoy, which was sent From Worc'ster, by Prince Rupert, with intent To bring the King from Oxford, with his Train Of Ordinance, to take the open Plain. But watchful Cromwel, meeting, at the Town Of Islip, with the Convoy, fell upon Their Horse, and, after a severe Dispute, Gave to the Loyal Side a total Rout, Pursuing those that from his Fury run, Into a House of strength call'd Blechingdon, Which Windebank, a Col'nel for the King, Basely surrender'd at once summoning, Tho' a stout Garison, and might have made A good Defence, but was, no doubt, betray'd; The Governour soon after, for his Fau't, B'ing try'd at Oxford, and condemn'd and shot, Whilst Cromwel, flush'd with this Success, march'd on To Farringdon, another Garison, Which he by Storm attempted, but in vain, Losing in the Assault Two-hundred Men, Many besides b'ing wounded in the fierce Attack, and sev'ral taken Prisoners, Which, in some Measure, tarnish'd his Success, And made his former Vict'ry seem the less. The King foreseing Fairfax's intent To besiege Oxford, for Prince Rupert sent, And Gen'ral Goring, with a strong Defence Of their best Troops, to guard him safe from thence, Who first encreas'd his Arms, and when he'd done, March'd on to the Relief of Chester Town, Whilst Goring, by the Order of his Liege, Return'd without delay to Taunton Siege, Which Town was for the Parliament possest, But wanting timely Succours was distress'd, That Fairfax, in Compassion, sent a Force Of Foot Five-hundred and Two-thousand Horse, With Colonel Welden, that he might attempt to raise The Siege, or, at the least, relieve the Place; But the Besiegers, hearing that the whole Of Fairfax Army, with their General, Were marching tow'rds them to relieve the Town, Resolv'd t'assault it e're the Foe came on, Which they perform'd, and in a little space Of time, an Entrance forc'd, with such Success, That in the furious Storm Two Streets they fir'd, Whilst he that govern'd in the Town retir'd Into the Castle, which they could not take, And therefore, when the Foe approach'd, drew back, Leaving the flaming Town to those that came To its Relief, but they possest the same No sooner, than the Enemy renew'd Their Siege with all the Vigour that they cou'd. Some Discontents now happen'd to commence 'Twixt Greenvil, Berkly, Goring, and the Prince Rupert, Which hurtful Jars encreas'd the Monarch's Cares, And fatal prov'd, at length, to his Affairs; For when Disputes among his Friends arose, Their Quarrels gave fresh Courage to his Foes. During this Int'rim, Fairfax had command To lay close Siege to Oxford, out of hand, Whilst the King (after he'd reliev'd the Town Of Chester) did at Leicester sit down, Assaulted and subdu'd the same by force, Took many Arms and noted Prisoners; From thence retiring with a large supply Of necessary Stores to Daventry. Fairfax b'ing soon allarm'd with this Success, Did in all haste his Siege at Oxford raise, And march'd his Army tow'rds the King, to try An open Battle for a Victory: The King appriz'd of his approach, drew forth His Army, and was moving further North, To the relief of Pomfret, much distress'd, By Roundhead Foes, who did the same invest, But Fairfax, under Ireton sent a Force, Consisting of his ablest flying Horse, To overtake the King, and to impede His Progress, which accordingly he did, Falling by Night, at Naseby, on the Rear Of the King's Army, which were quarter'd there, Where many by the Roundhead Troops were slain, But more in the surprising Scuffle ta'en. The King, allarm'd at Midnight, made his way To Harb'rough, where his Nephew Rupert lay, There call'd a Council, who resolv'd to face The Rebels at the next convenient place, And that they might more fearless Courage show They march'd in quest of the advancing Foe, Till both the Armies, equally inclin'd To fight, near Naseby Town in Battle join'd, Where the unhappy King, altho' he fought Like more than Man, sustain'd a total Rout, And in that fatal Contest with his Foes, Lost all at once a living Prince could lose; Among the rest, his Cabinet, wherein All his kind Letters from his Vertuous Queen, And other secret Papers were inclos'd, Which the base Rump indecently expos'd, That all the vile misjudging Crowd might see Th'Arcana's of distressed Majesty, A scandalous and poor Revenge, that none But Rebels could have offer'd to a Throne. The King himself, when he had lost the Fight June 14. Escaping by a swift, but wary Flight, And tho' he gather'd some dejected Troops, With which he wander'd up and down, in hopes To raise an Army, yet his Overthrow Soon sunk the Int'rest of his Cause so low, That he could ne'er recover strength to face The Foe, but dwindl'd into great Distress. For those that measure Justice by the Sword, When Fortune changes Sides, forsake their Lord. Fairfax, as soon as he'd the Battle won, Before the Walls of Leicester sate down June 16., And ent'ring on the Newark-Side by Storm, Gave the whole Town so frightful an Alarm, That he who Govern'd did a Parly beat, And, to prevent the loss of Blood, submit. Carlisle, who long had gallantly withstood A Siege, was also by the Foe subdu'd About a Week after Leicester. Despairing of Relief, when once they heard How ill their Sov'reign had at Naseby far'd. Goring, who lay before the wealthy Town Of Taunton, was, by Fairfax, overthrown July 11., Who, flush'd with these Successes, next besieg'd Bridgwater, and, in little time, oblig'd The Governour to yield, by firing Shot Forg'd like Jove's Thunderbolts till made so hot That they inflam'd the Thatch, and in a blaze Put sev'ral Houses, to the great amaze Of the poor Townsmen, that they cast aside Their Arms to save their Huts from b'ing destroy'd, Whilst Fairfax took advantage of their Fright, Threat'ning, unless they did forthwith submit, To storm the Town, allowing them a Day To send their Women and their Babes away, Which tender notice kindled up so great A Feud, that Windham was oblig'd to treat. Thus Cruelty, by painting of her Face With Craft, does often for Compassion pass. Bristol, by Rupert, was surrender'd next, Which unexpected Loss so highly vex'd The Royal Patience, that the King at once Revok'd his sev'ral high Commissions, And in a Letter full of Words severe, Bid him withdraw, and seek his Bread elsewhere. Nor did he merit less, since he resign'd A Town that he was able to defend, It being stor'd with all things that could be Accounted needful for Security. Next Hereford, (before whose Walls, in vain, The faithless Scots for sev'ral Months had lain From July the 13th, to the first of September., Till call'd into their Native Soil, to cross The flourishing Success of Brave Montross, By Col'nel Birch and Morgan was surpriz'd And taken December the 18th. e're the Town was advertis'd Of their approach; which further Loss encreas'd The growing Troubles of the Royal Breast. The Monarch hoping still to turn the Scales, Had brought a little Army Five-thousand, most Horse. out of Wales, With which new Force he had not long been gone From Hereford, to succour Chester Town, But in his way by Gen'ral Pointz was met, Who gave the King another shrewd Defeat; In which young Bernard Stuart Earl of Litchfield., who excell'd In Vertue, fell an Honour to the Field; Lord Digby also, who was sent to join Montross the Great, did in his March sustain A fatal Overthrow, that made him fly To Ireland to avoid the Enemy. The King being then at Newark, where so great A Discontent and mischievous Debate Arose, that the Two Princes Rupert and Maurice. thereupon, With sev'ral other Nobles, left the Town, For Norton-House, where they obtain'd a Pass, To leave the Kingdom for some foreign Place. Thus all the spight the angry Fates could show, Was spent this Year to bring the Monarch low; For e'ery Venture that he made was cross'd, And Towns were after Towns profusely lost, That his whole Strength so suddenly decay'd, Till 'twas almost to Oxford limited. Justice we find is but a slender Shield In War, 'tis Fortune that commands the Field; And she's too blind or prodigal to know An injur'd Prince from a rebellious Foe. The End of the Twenty-first Year. THE Earl of Northampton's CHARACTER. A noble, Loyal, and Uundaunted Peer, Who early took up Arms in Warwick-shire, When the Reforming War against the Throne, Was by the Roundhead Rebels just begun, Chasing the Rump's bold Champion, the Lord Brook, Till he that County with his Troops forsook; From Banb'ry Castle took the Ordinance, And with the same, did to the King advance; Rais'd at his own Expence an hardy, stout, And well accouter'd Regiment, of Foot, Also a gallant Troop of able Horse, First Levy'd when the King had little Force. Nor did he, like some cautious Peers, divide His Family, 'twixt one and 'tother side, But in the just defence of Sov'reign Pow'r, All his Brave Sons engag'd, in number Four, Who, under their own Father, bore command, And serv'd the Royal Cause with Heart and Hand At Keinton Fight the noble Hero shew'd His Conduct, Steddiness, and Fortitude; At Litchfield Siege, thro' many Dangers run, And boldly fac'd what others strove to shun, Bearing all Wants and Hardships, that the Field Of War could in the sharpest Season yield, Without the least Reluctancy or Tease, As if he'd ne'er been bred to downy Ease, Beat Gell and Bruerton upon Hopton-Heath, And bravely conquer'd at the time of Death, For in that Fight b'ing thrown, by sudden force, Amidst the furious Battle, from his Horse, He refus'd Quarter from the cruel Foe, Saying, he scorn'd to condescend so low, As to ask Life of Rebels to the Throne, Who by the Law, had forfeited their own. Thus rather chose to perish by the Sword, Than Mercy crave of those that he abhor'd, Leaving the King to mourn the fatal End Of such a Subject, Soldier, and a Friend; As great a loss as ever Prince sustain'd. How brave are those who rather chuse to die, Than live beneath Rebellious Tyranny: 'Tis nobler far to boldly yield to Fate, Than breathe beneath the gripes of those we hate. THE CHARACTER OF THE Earl of Lindsey, Son of the former. Brave, Active, Loyal, Generous, and Just, Firm to his Prince, and faithful to his Trust; [illeg.] all his Royal Master's Suff'rings shar'd, And in his Cause no painful Service spar'd; Was in the fatal Fight of Naseby-Field, Where Show'rs of Loyal Blood, in vain were spill'd, And where the King, as may be justly said, Not only lost three Kingdoms but his Head; Yet no severe Ill-Fortune could postpone The Earl's unfeign'd Obedience to the Throne; In Battle by his Princes side he stood, Had, with his own, defended Royal Blood, In Prison daily his attendance paid Lord Chamberlain. Then wicked Hammond had the King betray'd, And prov'd a faithful Servant and a Friend, To his dear injur'd Sov'reign, to his End; Beheld, with weeping Eyes, his rigid Fate, And mourn'd the Exit of the Good and Great; Paid his last Duties to the Royal Clay, When the dead Monarch in his Palace lay, Follow'd the Martyr, whom he could not save, To the dark peaceful Tenement, the Grave, O'er which he shed a Storm of Loyal Tears, As the last Tribute to the sacred Hearse; Did all that, to Posterity, could clear The Honour of so Just and Brave a Peer, And as he liv'd, from all Digressions free, A glory to himself and Family, So, at a Rev'rend Age, his Soul in peace Was summon'd calmly to Eternal Bliss, Whilst all that knew his Greatness mourn'd his Fate, Which came too soon, but could not come too late, For King and Country never yet sustain'd A better Subject or a truer Friend, Whose Father died in fighting for the Throne, And left his Vertues blooming in his Son. Thus worthy Parents great Examples give, By which their noble Race unblemish'd live, Whilst Rebels to Posterity convey That Sullen Pride that led themselves astray. THE Lord Digby's CHARACTER. Few noble Plants had in their Youth been rear'd With greater Care, as by his Parts appear'd, Upon all Subjects he could well discourse, And reason with unconquerable force; Nor did his Talk alone abound in Sence, But was adorn'd with pow'rful Eloquence, Set off with all the Majesty and Grace, That Words could borrow from a comely Face, And awful Presence, by such Art refin'd, That his whole Frame seem'd equal to his Mind, Consenting both, like mutual Friends, to add A gracefulness to all he did or said. Nor had he any Failing to eclipse The shining Sence that pass'd his flowing Lips, Except an Affectation which he us'd, But scarce so much as not to be excus'd. The Father of the Lord, when Buckingham Was in the Zenith of his Pow'r and Fame, Having receiv'd some Usage from the Duke, Which did himself and Family provoke, Digby the Son, then sitting in the House Of Commons, still resenting the abuse, Join'd with the Faction, hoping to compleat Revenge upon an Enemy so great; But, when that daring Villain gave the Blow That rid the Lord of his imperious Foe, He then deserted Faction, when he saw Their ill Designs did tow'rds Rebellion draw, And found some secret Methods to obtain The Grace and Favour of his Sovereign, Who, when the Convert Lord had purchas'd Peace By Vows of future faithful Services, And to the King, without reserve, made known The dark intrigues against the Church and Throne, Call'd him to th'House of Lords, where he appear'd The King's true Friend, and very wisely steer'd A steddy Course, approv'd by all but those Wh'admir'd him once, but now were turn'd his Foes That Monarch-teazing-Clan whose factious Zeal Was such, they lik'd him well when he did ill, But threw their Dirt upon him when they found He'd chang'd a Miry-Slough for firmer Ground. From his first entrance into Royal Grace, In the King's Favour he advanc'd apace, His Majesty scarce knowing who to trust, His Friends were grown so tim'rous or unjust, Therefore that some such Persons might be nigh The King, that were of great Fidelity, The Lord his Int'rest with the Throne imploy'd To promote Falkland, Colepepper, and Hyde, Three worthy Men of Parts, in whom his Prince, Or self, at least, might place a Confidence; For 'twas observ'd he would, in nice Affairs, Wave his own Judgment and submit to theirs, Provided that he found, upon Debate, Their Arguments unbiass'd, and more great; But in some things, where his ambitious Soul Desir'd the Reputation of the whole, Or to secure a part, that he might claim, Distinct from others, a peculiar Fame, Then would he hold back some reserve, and Act Without a ministerial Compact; By which rash Temper he was often steer'd Upon those very Dangers that he fear'd, And frequently involv'd in such Affairs, That promis'd well, but sunk in the reverse. 'Tis fatal to the Great, tho' ne'er so wise, To singly steer, or singly to Advise; That prudent Statesman always fares the best, Who jointly Acts in concert with the rest. THE Earl of Litchfield's CHARACTER. An active Youth, of an Heroick Mind, Valiant by Nature, and to Arms inclin'd, In the harsh Discipline of War well skill'd, Loyal and Brave as ever grac'd the Field, Did early high in Royal Favour stand, And of the King's own Troop had the Command, Consisting of such Quality whose clear Estates, by computation, did appear, At least, thrice Fifty-thousand Pounds a Year, A noble Guard, fit only for defence Of such a Cause, and such an injur'd Prince: Nor did this Gallant Body only grace Their Sov'reign in his March from Place to Place, But perform'd Wonders wheresoe'er they came, And purchas'd with their Swords immortal Fame, Much to the Glory of the Valiant Peer, Who led 'em on thro' Danger, void of Fear: At Litchfield he deserv'd, by Deeds of War, That Title which the prosp'rous Hero bore: At Marlborough three Posts he bravely won, And had two Horses shot before the Town, Losing, by Computation, as he stood Engag'd, near forty Ounces of his Blood: At Newb'ry second Battle he retriev'd Sir Humphry Bennet, Col'nel Legg reliev'd, And flank'd the Enemy with such Success, That he destroy'd vast Numbers on the place. Lastly, near Chester, upon Routon-Heath, He boldly fought till he receiv'd his Death, Falling, in his Retreat, the last of Three Dear Brothers who had serv'd His Majesty. 'Tis hard the cruel Sword should sacrifice, Out of one Family, so rich a Prize; But, when such Blood was by the Rebels spilt, Is heighten'd not their Glory, but their Guilt. A.D. 1646. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Twenty-second Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1646. The King to Oxford being now retir'd With's broken Troops, still earnestly desir'd That some Relief to Chester might be sent, To save that City from the Parliament; Accordingly some Troops and Bands were drawn From sev'ral Western Garisons, by Sir William Vaughan, Who, near to Chester, meeting with the Foe, Unhappily sustain'd an Overthrow, That now despairing of Relief, the Town Surrender'd to Sir William Bruerton, Who gave 'em Terms more honourably fair, Than those within could reas'nably desire, Because himself was first made Flesh and Blood, Within that County where the City stood, O'er which he hop'd to exercise the Pow'r, (Since he had won the same) of Governour; And therefore was unwilling, by a Storm, To do the Townsmen, or their Houses, harm. Hopton, soon after this, was overthrown By Fairfax, at the Town of Torrington, Where, from the Prince of Wales., he had the Chief Command Of a divided Host, that would not stand The Foe, but left their General to seek His safety, wounded by a Pike i'th' Cheek, Who fled to Stratton, and from thence retir'd To Bodmin, as his present Case requir'd, Where Goring's Horse, upon a neighb'ring Down, Were posted as a Safeguard to the Town, But without Orders march'd away and left The faithful Hopton and his Foot to shift; When the flush'd Foe, encourag'd by their Spoils At Torrington, were march'd within three Miles, And forc'd the Prince of Wales, for safety-sake, To move from Launceston, and to betake Himself to strong Pendennis Castle., where he staid Till he to Scilly Island was convey'd March 2., Whilst Hopton, when the Foe advanc'd so nigh, Did, with his broken Host, more Westward fly, Where Mutinies arose among his Horse, And such Disputes between his Officers, That he was forc'd, at length, when past all hopes Of doing Service with such treach'rous Troops, To send his Foot, who'd been of great Account, Thro' all the Troubles, to the Cornish-Mount, And to Pendennis, giving, with regret, Consent that his unruly Troops should treat With Gen'ral Fairfax, who before had sent A Trumpeter with Terms, to try their Bent; So that the Horse did, to their shame, disband Themselves, according to the Foes demand; Whilst Hopton, who had gen'rously refus'd The best Conditions Fairfax had propos'd, Retir'd with Capel to the Mount, from whence They both took Shipping to attend the Prince. When Fairfax thus had broke the Western Force, The Cornish Garisons fell in of course, Few holding out upon the King's Account, Except Pendennis-Castle and the Mount, That having done the Senate's bus'ness there, He now return'd to th'Siege of Exeter. After these fatal Blows the King had none But the Lord Astley Sir Jacob, created Lord about two Years since. to rely upon, Who'd kept together the Remains of those That had, near Chester, suffer'd by their Foes, And tow'rds the King was marching with his Force, To join with Campsfield and the Oxford Horse, Who had agreed to meet him in his way, But thro' misinformation or delay, It was so long e're Campsfield's Troops came on, That Astley was by Morgan A Parliament Colonel. overthrown, And routed near a Place call'd Donnington March 31., Himself b'ing taken Pris'ner, to the great Disint'rest of the King's declining State, Who now had little hopes to long secure The Town of Oxford from the Rebels Pow'r. The King who had so oft desir'd, in vain, To reconcile th'Annoyers of his Reign, Had lately shewn a peaceable intent To treat in Person with the Parliament; But they by Message March 30. pray'd him to forbear His Purpose of approaching Westminster, Alledging 'twas unsafe for him and them; And voted thereupon, that if he came To London, the Militia should have Pow'r, T'oppose, to apprehend and to secure His Train of Followers, himself, in short, And all that to their Sov'reign had resort. Thus prosp'rous Rebels triumph o'er the Great, When once reduc'd to a defenceless State, With the same Tyranny they falsly charge On Kings, whose Pow'r they always think too large. Exeter City, which for Months had been Besieged, and now was much distress'd within, For want of Succour, yielded to the Arms Of Fairfax, upon honourable Terms April 13.. Soon after this, the Mount, and sev'ral more Strong-Holds, surrendring to the Rebels Pow'r: That Fairfax having now subdu'd the West, Had little else to do but to invest The King in Oxford, which had been oblig'd, Of late, to many Straits, tho' not besieg'd, By Roundhead Troops Under Command of Fleetwood and Rainsborough., that hover'd up and down, To intercept Provisions from the Town. But the King hearing of the Foes intent, Resolv'd upon a new Expedient, In hopes to stop his Ruin, by a strange Surprising Scheme, that probably might change The face of his Affairs, which now appear'd So desperate as to be justly fear'd. The King, to put in practise what he'd kept So Secret, that his Project only slept Within his Royal Breast, did so disguise His sacred Person, to avoid surprise, That he escap'd from Oxford with no more Attendance than a sober Minister Mr. Hudson., And such another trusty Friend, whose Name, Among the Loyal List, was Ashburnham: With these the King stole privately away April 27. To the Scotch Camp, which before Newark lay; None guessing where the Sov'reign could be gone, Tho' most believ'd he was conceal'd in Town, Which so alarm'd the Senate, that they pass'd A Vote, with all imaginable haste, And order'd, That whoever should conceal The King, and not immediately reveal The same to both the Speakers, they should be Esteem'd a Traytor, and an Enemy Toth' Commonwealth; and, for a Crime so great, Dye without Mercy'nd forfeit their Estate. But they'd no sooner made their Order known, By publication to the Factious Town, But they receiv'd Advice, their Injur'd Prince Had trusted to a Scotch Deliverance, Much rather than to fall into the Pow'r Of those who'd sought his Life so oft before. This gave the Senate such a deep surprize, They scarce knew what to do, or to surmize: At length, recov'ring Spirit, 'twas agreed, By Vote, That they forthwith should interceed With Lesly and the Scotch Commissioners, And shew 'em 'twas the Parliament's Desires, That Both the Houses should intirely be The sole Disposers of His Majesty: Also that they'd agreed, and did appoint, The King to Warwick-Castle should be sent; And that John Ashburnham, and whosoe'er Did to their Army with the King repair, By th'Sergeant tending on the House, should be Sent as Delinquents into Custody; And that the Parliament's Commissioners, Who then at Newark manag'd their Affairs, Should, with all speed, a Narrative dispatch T'th' House, of the King's coming to the Scotch. But just as they had pass'd their Votes, there came A Letter from the Scots that cross'd their Aim, Importing, That since Providence had sent So great a Blessing to their Camp, they meant To mediate 'twixt the King and Parliament, That both the Kingdoms might establish'd be, In Peace and Godly Uniformity, And all things center in a good Event, According to the League and Covenant. Newark, which had begun to treat May 4. before The King surrender'd to the Scottish Pow'r, Did, on the Ninth of the same Month, agree To yield the Town unto the Enemy, Where Lord Bellasis had made a long Defence, Like a brave trusty Servant to his Prince. Lesly the Scot, the better to secure His Royal Charge, now march'd with all his Pow'r, From Southwel to Newcastle, where the King, By th'Scots, was put upon the publishing An Order to his Governours of Towns, Forts, Castles, and all other Garisons, Requiring, that, on honourable Terms, They should surrender to the Senate's Arms; Which, in a little time, was e'erywhere Perform'd, according to the King's Desire; Oxford submitting June 25., after treating long, Whose Garison was Seven-thousand strong. Fairfax transmitting all the Seals of State Broad-Seal, Privy-Seal, King's-Bench, Exchequer, Court of Wards, Admiralty, and Navy Seals. To Westminster, where, after some Debate, The same were hammer'd, by a Smith, before The Lords, who, when they'd bruis'd the Tools of Pow'r, Order'd the broken silver Scraps should be Divided 'twixt their Speakers, as a Fee. The crafty Scots, who were with plunder stor'd, In marching 'twixt the Tweed and Hereford, Were now desirous, with their Loads of Spoil, To haste in safety to their Native Soil; But hearing that Montrose, altho' his Pow'r Had been quite routed but the Year before By David Lesly., Was now again beginning to advance His Loyal Sword in Royal Charles Defence, They press'd the King to lay Commands upon His Friend to give up his Commission, Who, in Obedience, did his Troops disband, And then took Shipping to a Foreign Land France.. Thus Wisemen, when they see those Mischiefs nigh, They cannot frustrate, from the Danger fly. Whilst the King staid at Southwel there had been A fruitless Treaty put on foot, wherein The Rump insisted upon Terms so high, As if they only scoff'd at Majesty, And rather strove to irritate the King, Than that a Peace from such Efforts should spring Who, notwithstanding, from Newcastle sent August 1. So mild a Message to the Parliament, Wherein his Arguments must be allow'd, By all but Rebels, to be Just and Good, And must have work'd on any but so base A Herd, that wanted Sense as well as Grace, But all, unless the Sov'reign would resign His Kingship, was but off'ring Pearls to Swine, For still his Condescensions were despis'd, And as he stoop'd, the more they tyranniz'd. Now great Debates between the Scots Commissioners for Scotland then residing here. arose, And the warm Leaders of the Common-House, About which faithless Rebels should Command Their Suff'ring Prince, that weighty Point in hand: The Scotch Commissioners set forth how base, How cruel, treacherous, and vile a Race, Themselves and Brethren would appear to be, In case they render'd up His Majesty, When in Distress he'd chosen them alone, As Guardians of his Person and his Throne: But all this crafty outside Tenderness, Prov'd nothing but an Artifice to raise The Sum, for which they villanously sold The King they lov'd, but not so well as Gold. So Traytor Judas did his Lord betray, To Jews, for Pence, and taught the Scots the way. The End of the Twenty-second Year. The Lord Fairfax's CHARACTER. A factious Hero, by the Roundheads fam'd, True to that Cause which all good Men condemn'd, Was, by the Rump, made Gen'ral of the North, As early as the flagrant Storm broke forth, Where he soon levy'd a Rebellious Force, Of near Six-thousand Yorkshire Foot and Horse, With which he rang'd about in Martial Pride, Declaring loudly for the Rebels Side; And tho' in War-Affairs but poorly skill'd; Was, for a time, sole Master of the Field; Till Brave Newcastle, much enrag'd to see Such Rigour us'd with Sov'reign Majesty, Like a just Peer espous'd the Royal Cause, And toil'd to save the Church, the Crown and Laws; By whose Industry, Courage, and Success, The Rebel-Troops were chas'd from place to place, Till Fairfax and his Host of Rural Swains, At length, were forc'd to quit the Northern Plains, And in close Garisons unactive lye, To shun the Fury of the Enemy, Till Fortune chang'd her Side at Marston-Moor, And did the Roundhead Peer to Pow'r restore: But by himself few Laurel-Wreaths were won, The Father's Fame depended on the Son. We'll therefore say but little of the Lord, Whose only Brav'ry was to draw his Sword Against the best of Kings, to serve a base, Rebellious, cruel, and perfidious Race. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Thomas (Son of the Lord) Fairfax. Whate'er the Father wanted to compleat A Gen'ral, for the Rebels purpose fit, Was found confirm'd in the disloyal Son, Who with uncommon Zeal oppos'd the Throne, In sundry Battles Loyal Heaps destroy'd, And prov'd the truest Friend the Rump imploy'd: Took Col'nel Bellasis at Selby, Town, Defeating a strong Party of the Crown, And by that means regain'd the Roundhead Host, That Northern Footing which his Father lost. Soon after, for his Service, was, instead Of Essex, by the Rump, their Gen'ral made. Invested Oxford, but without Success, Drew off his Forces, much to his Disgrace, Having at the Assault of Borstal-House, Been vig'rously resisted to his Loss; Whilst harrass'd Majesty sate down before, And took, by Storm, the Town of Leicester. By which sad News the disaffected Side Were much surpris'd, and greatly mortify'd, The Rump, as 'twas their Custom, charging all Ill-fortune on their new-made General; For all Success they challeng'd as their Right, And when God fail'd, at Man they cast their spight; However, Fairfax very soon retriev'd The Loss, at which they were so much aggriev'd, And in the fatal Field of Naseby won That Victory which cost the King his Crown, And at one Blow o'erturn'd the Royal Cause, Subdu'd the Throne, Religion, and the Laws. Flush'd with this Conquest, for it prov'd no less, He boldly march'd in quest of new Success, And in the Western Shire of Somerset, With Goring and his Troops near Lamport met, And in their Quarters gave them a Surprise, That added to his former Victories, Follow'd his Blows, and took Bridgewater-Town; At Torrington bore Hopton's Forces down; From Bedford a superb Epistle sent, To sharply reprehend the Parliament, For joining with the City to evade An Ordinance themselves before had made. To Hounslow-Heath his Army march'd in Pomp, Awing, by their approach, the jealous Rump; Forc'd Lords and Commons to receive their two Old Speakers, after they had chosen New; And to their Seats restor'd Eleven more, Secluded by their Arbitrary Pow'r. March'd into Kent, a Rising to suppress, Chas'd 'em to Maidstone, fought 'em with Success, Forc'd Earl of Norwich and his Forces to retire To Essex, block'd 'em up in Colchester, Which, after many sharp Disputes, between The Foes and those that sally'd from within, At last surrender'd, where the Gen'ral us'd Barbarities too black to be excus'd. Yet, after he had done these mighty Feats, Waded in Blood, and toil'd in Colds and Heats, To curse his Native Land, and overthrow That Prince to whom he did Allegiance owe, He rather chose to fling up his Command, Than head an Army 'gainst the Scottish Land; Because those faithful pious Saints profess'd The same Religion he approv'd the best. In which he shew'd more Conscience, than in all [illeg.] Hero ever did since General. So crafty Men, who covet high Command, To injure and oppress their Native Land, Do always with some goldly Party side, To sanctify their Villany and Pride. Nor was he other than a useful Tool, To crafty Cromwel, who usurp'd the Rule, Tho' to the credit of the Knight, who long Had persever'd and glory'd in the wrong, He did refuse to grace that bloody Court, Which made the best of Prince's Lives their Sport, Had sent his Lady, 'tis suppos'd, to see The manner of the curs'd Solemnity; Who, as their Clerk was loudly calling o'er The odious Names of each Commissioner, Hearing her Spouse in the Rebellious List, Twice summon'd to appear among the rest, Reply'd, He had more Wit than to be there; Which Voice ascending from they knew not where, The Court, in a surprize, began to look About, demanding who it was that spoke; But finding no return or answer made, Proceeded, and their High-Commission read, Till to that part they came, where they had strain'd Their Cant to, “All good People of the Land. At which the Lady answer'd in a Scoff, No, no, nor yet the hundredth part thereof. Which so provok'd the Court, who plainly heard The words, that the Commander of the Guard First bid them fire upon the Box from whence Arose that false and daring Insolence; But soon perceiving who it was that spoke, Did, with regret, his rash Command revoke, And Madam, 'twixt Perswasion and Constraint, Quitted her Station and away she went, Leaving the Court in Anger, to record Her Presence, and the Absence of her Lord. But he that could, without Reluctance, run Thro' the whole Series of Rebellion, And sneakingly refuse to crown the Evil, Stuck only out at last to cheat the Devil. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Arthur Haslerig. A bold and busy Knight, bred up by Pym, Till qualify'd for e'ery vile Extream, A factious Member in the Commons-House, Forward of Tongue, and daringly morose, An active and unweary'd Tool in all The impious Projects of the dire Cabal; None prouder to perform whate'er was Ill, The first that brought in the Militia Bill: Also that fatal, infamous, and base Attainder which was pass'd in Strafford's Case; Thro' all the Series of Rebellion run, Doing whate'er he ought not to have done, Had no regard to either Church or State, But did in both all Form and Order hate, And chiefly sided with those Wolves and Bears, Who glory'd in the Name of Levellers, Made up of all the wild and unrestrain'd Enthusiastick Sect'ries in the Land, Wh' oppos'd each single Person that aspir'd Aloft, yet knew not what themselves desir'd, But fought for Spoil and Plunder, in the Name Of God and Conscience, without Fear or Shame. Yet had the Knight the Luck, in spight of War, And all the Dangers he encounter'd there, To see his own and all his Party's Pride, By the King's Restoration mortify'd; A Blessing that he ne'er deserv'd to find, Because ingrateful to his stubborn Mind. Thus many oft possess, yet not enjoy, Those Comforts which their wrong Conceits destroy: But as the Fable-Cock, by Nature led To rake the Muck-hill, where he first was bred, The precious Jewel in their Pow'r despise, And think the Horsedung-Oat the richer Prize. THE Earl of Kingston's CHARACTER. Born of an ancient Race, who first came o'er Among the Normans, to the British Shore, And, like his Ancestors, enjoy'd a Soul, Of Vertue, Loyalty, and Valour full. When first those Civil-Wars began to spread, That prosper'd till they reach'd the Monarch's Head, The Noble Earl, with full Four-thousand Men, Attended on his wand'ring Sovereign; One Loyal-half assisting with no less Than twice Twelve-thousand Pounds in his distress, The rest beneath the Royal-Banner staid, And frankly tender'd him their pers'nal Aid: But Fortune who too often takes a Pride, In War, to frown upon the juster Side, Suffer'd th'unhappy Earl to be surpriz'd At Gainsbrough-Town, and by the Rebels Commanded by the Lord Willoughby. seiz'd, Who knowing him a Man severely bent Against the Int'rest of the Parliament, Put him on Board a Pinnace, with a Guard, That he for safety might to Hull be carr'd. Which mournful Tidings happening to reach The Ears of Loyal Col'nel Cavendish, With friendly speed he labour'd to o'ertake The Boat, in hopes to bring the Pris'ner back, But when the Col'nel's Vessel came so near To hail the Pinnace and demand the Peer, The Rebel-Crew refus'd to quit their Charge, And with more strenuous Pulls row'd on their Barge, Which so provok'd the Col'nel, that he fir'd A fatal Shot Out of a Drake. by which the Earl expir'd, And his poor Servant, whom the Rogues had plac'd I'th' front of Danger, as their Boat was chas'd; Which sad Misfortune gave so keen an edge To the Pursuer's Grief, as well as Rage, That bidding his dear injur'd Friend adieu, Like angry Jove his Thunderbolts he threw, And to his Manes sacrific'd the Rebel-Crew. A.D. 1647. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Twenty-third Year of the Reign of King Charles the First. Anno Dom. 1647. No sooner had the King refus'd to grant January. The base Proposals of the Parliament, Contriv'd with veh'mence to divest him quite Of Kingly Pow'r, and all his Sov'reign Right, But the Rump-Senate readily agreed To pay the Rebels, who had cross'd the Tweed, Two-hundred-thousand Pounds upon the Nail, When they deliver'd Berwick and Carlisle, Also Newcastle; and a second Sum, As weighty, to be paid in time to come, Firmly secur'd by Parliament, upon The Publick Faith, altho' the Land had none. When thus agreed, the treach'rous Scots began To treat about their injur'd Sovereign; And tho' their Managers first talk'd so much Of Honour, and the danger of Reproach, Yet had the Rump no sooner sent the Coin Agreed for, to Newcastle upon Tine, But, notwithstanding all their former large Professions, they resign'd their Royal Charge, And fix'd upon their faithless scabby Race, The Epithets of Infamous and Base. Thus Honour often serves the crafty Saints, To blind the Credulous with Sham-pretence, But nothing binds the Godly but the Pence. The King thus wretchedly betray'd by those He trusted, to the hands of cruel Foes, Set forth February the 8th., with them that had him in their Care, To Hold'nby-Palace in Northampton-shire, Where not a Chaplain, Servant, or a Friend, Were on his Person suffer'd to attend, Refusing him a Book of Common-Pray'r, When ask'd for by the Royal Prisoner; Which look'd as if their impious Rage pursu'd The Quiet of his Soul, as well as Blood. No sooner had the Rebels thus immur'd Their King, and all his Garisons secur'd, But now the restless Faction, who before Had join'd their Hands to pull down Sov'reign Pow'r, Began themselves to quarrel and divide, Altho' so near in Villany ally'd. The Presbyterian Tribe presum'd a Right To form the Commonwealth as they thought fit, Who, by their Covenant with Scotland, were Oblig'd to govern here as they did there; At least 'twas their Opinion they were bound To plant Geneva Thorns on English Ground, Because they thriv'd in Scotland, where the Soil Was barren, and the common People vile. The moody Independant thought that he Had equal Title to Authority, Therefore oppos'd the Scheme the Presbyter Had laid, as too conclusive and severe, Allowing no Parochial Guide should low'r His Holy Pride to a Provincial Pow'r, But that each Pulpit (now become a Tub) Should be Co-ordinate, instead of Sub-. The Guides by whom these Saints were chiefly led, Had sev'ral Years before a Ruffle made In the Assembly of Divines, which then, Excepting few, were Presbyterian, Who having, in the Year of Forty-three, Compil'd their much-ador'd Directory, In order to impose the same on all The Nation, as a Form in general, Five of their Members Thomas Goodwin, Philip Pye, Sidrack Simpson, Jeremiah [illeg.]roughs, William Bridge., more reform'd than they, Oppos'd the Model which before 'em lay, And being full of Grace and stubborn Zeal, Made from their own Assembly an Appeal To Parliament, wherein they humbly pray'd, No hardships upon Conscience might be laid, By the Assembly, neither might they be Concluded by their Votes, but still be free To seek the Lord the way they were intent Upon, without Compulsion or Constraint. By this Appeal they made themselves secure Against the Presbyterian then in Pow'r: And from that time so very fast encreas'd, That by degrees they craftily possess'd Most of the Church-Preferments, and the best. Cromwel and Ireton now, to serve their Ends The better, prov'd the Independants Friends, Laid hold of all Occasions to oblige That Party, and encourag'd Privilege Of Conscience, tho' themselves did both incline Unto the Presbyterian Discipline. But crafty Cromwel finding that he gain'd The Love o'th' Army under his Command, Compos'd of more Enthusiastick Throngs, Of diff'rent Sects, than Babel e'er had Tongues; And finding all but those who had acquir'd The Rule, a common Liberty desir'd, That e'ery Zealot's Conscience might be eas'd, And each plod on to Heav'n which way he pleas'd, Us'd his best means to humour 'em, in hopes To make himself the Darling of his Troops, That he, in time, might influence the same, To thwart the Rump and disappoint their Aim, Well knowing when they'd vacated the Throne, The Sword had the best Title to the Crown; Therefore Old Nol did all Occasions seek, To make the Presbyterian Sect more weak, Discharging many by his Courts of War, And Independants did as oft prefer; Which made the jealous Rump suspect he meant No good to Presbyter or Parliament, Who therefore soon determin'd to disband The Army e're it gain'd the upper-hand; But when Both Houses to St. Edmund's Bury, the Army's Head-Quarters. sent The Orders they had made to that intent, The Officers would not obey, but met, And did themselves the weighty Point debate, Chusing their Adjutators from among The scoundrel Class of the Bellonian Throng, Which wise Assembly was to represent The Army as a Martial Parliament: These were so manag'd that they soon agreed To ruffle those they had so long obey'd, Engaging solemnly to not divide Their Body till the Senate had comply'd With all their Gen'ral-Council should demand On their behalf, e're th'Army should disband. But during these Commotions, Cornet Joyce, With a strong Party, came to Hold'nby-House June 4., And the next Day did tow'rds the Army bring, From close Confinement, the dejected King, Toth' great Surprize of those who had the Pow'r Of using him so barb'rously before: But on the sixth of June the Gen'ral Fairfax. sent A Letter to his Lords the Parliament, In which he utterly deny'd that he Had order'd Joyce t'attend His Majesty, Or that he knew one tittle of the same, Before the King into the Army came. This was the first sly Trick that Cromwel play'd, Which gave him such Advantage, that he said, With no small Boast, That in his Pocket now He'd got the Parliament and City too. Which was indeed but truth, for when they heard The News, they both alike concern'd appear'd, The more, because 'twas rumour'd up and down, The Army were advancing tow'rds the Town, Which made 'em jealous Fairfax would restore The injur'd Sov'reign to his lawful Pow'r. But that, alas, was an attoning Act, Too glorious for such Rebels to effect. The King with Ostentation now was carr'd From Place to Place, beneath a pompous Guard, Till settl'd at his Palace Hampton-Court, Whither his Friends had freedom to resort, And where his Hold'nby Insults and Neglect, Were chang'd for more Enlargement and Respect; Besides a Promise passionately made, By treach'rous Cromwel, basely to perswade The King, amidst his Troubles, he should be Restor'd to all the Rights of Majesty. The Senate mov'd their Gen'ral Officers T'return the King to their Commissioners. Instead of which the Army boldly sent Articles, frightful to the Parliament, In which they charg'd a National Abuse Upon Eleven Members of the House, Requiring they should all suspended be From Parliamentary-Authority. With many more Demands as gross as this, Relating to whate'er they thought amiss. They also forc'd the City to agree In changing of their old Lieutenancy, And wholly to resign into the Hands O'th' Army's Friends their Military Bands. The Mob London Apprentices, July 26. arose and made the Rump restore The same toth' City as enjoy'd before, Which caus'd each Speaker to forsake his Chair, And seek his Safety with the Men of War; Who, tho' the City bravely mann'd their Works, And firmly were resolv'd to fight like Turks, Oblig'd the Heroes soon to answer all The stiff Demands of the proud General, Who, by a Party, got within their Lines, On Southwark-side, which strengthen'd the Designs Of Cromwel and his Followers so much, That they convey'd a Letter of Reproach Toth' May'r and Aldermen, on whom they cast The Blame of all the London Tumults past, Requiring, among other high Demands, The City and their Military Bands, To be giv'n up into the Army's hands, Forcing them also to withdraw their Guard From the poor Senate, who were all so scar'd, That many flinch'd, and thought it time to run From Rump to Army for Protection. When these and whatsoever were desir'd, Were punctually comply'd with as requir'd, The Army march'd in Triumph thro' the Town, And in a little time made all their own. Nor did the Rump, in Power so severe, Now over-aw'd by Arms, less Tame appear; For when the Gen'ral, to reform the State From impious Knaves, by putting in as great, Sent his Lieutenant Cromwel to restore The Speakers, who had fled the Rump before, And other Members who'd secluded been, When Calvin's Rebels did in triumph Reign. So sooner had the Speakers repossess'd Their Chairs, but Rump unitedly address'd The Gen'ral with a Compliment of Thanks, For all these crafty countermining Pranks, Did also fix a Day that Heav'n might be Most insincerely thank'd as well as he. And, like true Saints, their Gratitude to show, Chose him, thro' Fear, their Gen'ralissimo; Also t'enlarge his arbitrary Pow'r, Made him Lord-Constable of London-Tow'r; Which was indeed no more than underhand Advancing Cromwel to the same Command; For tho' the Gen'ral had the Property, His Second was the Usufractuary. The lank-hair'd Independants now pull'd down The Works the Rump had rais'd about the Town, Divided the Militia London, Southwark, and Westminster., which had been United in the Presbyterian Reign; Remov'd all Governours of Castles, Towns, And other useful Forts and Garisons, Who from their Faith or Int'rest did dissent, Tho' plac'd by Ordinance of Parliament; Injoin'd Both Houses to repeal their past Proceedings, from the time of July last From the 26th thereof, to the 6th of August.. And when thus far without a Trip they'd run, Imprison'd sev'ral Lords, the May'r for one. Now crafty Cromwel, who began to see The Way thus open to the Sov'reignty, To gain the easier his ambitious Ends, Imploy'd the trustiest of his Rebel-Friends, T'apprise the King the Adjutators meant To murd'r'im and usurp the Government; Also to spread a Rumour of the same, That it might reach his Ear by common Fame. His Majesty allarm'd with this Report, To disappoint 'em stole from Hampton-Court November 11., One dark and rainy Night, when he was free Of Guards, who had retir'd designedly, As many thought, to tempt him to embrace That Juncture by their seeming Carelesness. No sooner had the King thus made his way, And cross'd the River, where Attendance lay With all Conveniencies to carr' him off, And render his Escape both swift and safe, But he began his Journey tow'rds the Main, Near to Southampton-Port, where should have lain A Vessel, by appointment, but she fail'd, Being by Fate or Accident with-held, In which the King design'd to cross the Seas, To France, from his Intestine Enemies, But disappointed thus, was wasted o'er To Cows In the Isle of Wight., where Hammond then was Governor, His Brother Chaplain to the King, and best Belov'd, for his great Worth, of all the rest, Therefore His Majesty thought fit to trust The Soldier 'cause he knew the Scholar just; But Brothers, differently bred, we find Are oft to Contrarieties inclin'd; As the good Monarch, wandring in Distress, Experienc'd, to his great Unhappiness; For he'd no sooner trusted, void of Fear, His Freedom, Life, and all that could be dear, In the perfidious Col'nel, but he sent A Letter to inform the Parliament, And, like a base inhumane Wretch, betray'd The King, and all that had been done or said; And from a Friend, most treach'rously became His Prince's Jailor, rendering the Name Of wicked Hammond, to the just and true, In every Christian Age that shall ensue, Odious as wicked Haman to the faithless Jew. The End of the Twenty-third Year. THE CHARACTER OF Sir George Lisle. Bred up to War, in Arms compleatly skill'd, Inur'd to all the Hardships of the Field; In the Low-Countries had continu'd long A Soldier, where he trail'd a Pike, when young, Obtaining, by Experience, the repute Of b'ing an exc'lent Officer of Foot, Was of a courteous Temper, cool and kind, No Man to more Humanity inclin'd; By which engaging Qualities he gain'd The Hearts of all Men under his Command: Nor would he ever suff'r 'em to be led To Action lest himself was at their Head, That they might see he scorn'd they should be steer'd Upon those dang'rous Shelves their Leader fear'd. At the last Newb'ry Battle, in the sight Of Majesty, he led the Foot to fight, Strip'd to his Shirt, that others might descry His Actions, and Example take thereby; From whence the frighted Rebels gave it out, That a white Witch was seen to fly about The Royal Army, scowring to and fro, Where'er the Contest did the hottest grow At Bramdean-Heath, by Courage and by Skill, Kept with small Force an advantagious Hill, Against all Waller's Army, and defy'd Ten times the number with undaunted Pride. At Newb'ry he commanded the Forlorn, And did in safety, with Success, return. At Naseby, where the King sustain'd a Rout, He led the left-hand Tertia of the Foot, Tho' beaten, did uncommon Valour show, And bravely fought both Fortune and the Foe. At Colchester, the Foot most bravely led, When they the three grand desp'rate Charges made, Fighting with so much Fury, to their Fame, That to Club-Musket e'ery time they came: In the first Charge the Word he gave was Crown, Which he had serv'd so well to his Renown; In the next Charge, Prince Charles; and in the third, The Hero made the Duke of York the Word; Resolving, whilst he'd under his Command, A Man to fight, or Rebel to withstand Their lawful Prince, to run thro', if he cou'd, The Names, in course, of all the Royal Blood. Was taken twice, in Sallies from the Town, By Rebel-Soldiers, rescu'd by his own. In short, no Grecian Bands, or Roman Host, A Milder or a Braver Man could boast, Who, when his Bosom-Friend, Sir Charles Lucas., was led In triumph to his Stand, and there shot dead, He run and kiss'd his Cheek, when they had fir'd, And cry'd, How soon is a Brave Soul expir'd! Adding, I shall be with thee by and by. Then instantly prepar'd himself to die; And as he boldly stood, with Eyes disclos'd, His Arms extended, and his Breast expos'd, To nakedly submit to Rebels Law, He beckon'd for the File to nearer draw; At which a barb'rous Ruffain, in a Jeer, Cry'd out, I'll pass my word we'll hit you, Sir. The chearful Knight replying to the same, I've oft been nearer when you've miss'd your Aim. After which Words they let their Vengeance fly, And shot him dead who never fear'd to die. When Rebels thus usurp the Ruling Pow'r, The greatest Vertue is the least secure; For base Usurpers never can maintain By Mercy, what by Cruelty they gain. THE CHARACTER OF Sir Charles Lucas. None better skill'd in the Command of Horse, Bold as a Lyon in the Field of Mars, But too imperious and morose to gain Much Reputation with politer Men, Descended of an ancient worthy Race, Who'd either held Commissions of the Peace, Or serv'd High-Sheriff in the former Reigns, Of full eleven Kings and Regent Queens; Was also younger Brother of a Peer Lord Lucas., And to the Honour and Estate the Heir, Had been in Holland bred beneath the Prince Of Orange, where he gain'd Experience In War-Affairs, and at Breda began To shew such Courage seldom found in Man, Entring a dang'rous Breach before the rest, Where num'rous Deaths were aiming at his Breast, And with Success most manfully maintain'd The Post which he so daringly had gain'd; Was only then a Cornet, but was soon Advanc'd for the great Brav'ry he had shown. In England he espous'd the Loyal Side, And was, at first, against the Scots imploy'd. At Newbury he led Two-thousand Horse, And met, on Ouborn-Heath, the Rebels Force, Headed by Essex, whom he bravely fought, With great Success, and even Wonders wrought; Advanc'd himself before the Fight begun, And Pistol'd him that led the Rebels on In e'ery Action won immortal Fame, And reap'd fresh Laurels wheresoe'er he came; At Caywood-Castle, and at Marston-Moor; At Newark, Berkly, and at Colchester, Where Hunger, after Horse-flesh had been eat For sev'ral Weeks, compel'd them to submit; And where proud Fairfax, Ireton, and a Knot Of cruel Traytors doom'd him to be shot, Who, when he'd pray'd, expos'd his Breast and cry'd, Now Rebels do your worst; and so he dy'd. What mortal Man, that either hears or sees The Brav'ry of such Sufferers as these, Can fear expiring in a Righteous Cause, Back'd with Religion, Justice, and the Laws. THE Lord Capel's CHARACTER. No Person in the Age he liv'd possess'd More Vertue, or more Piety profess'd, Having, by Friends, been often heard to say, That when he'd strictly kept the Sabbath-day, He always, to his great Contentment found The foll'wing Week successfully go round. A large Estate he, by Descent, enjoy'd, Improv'd by th'Fortune of a worthy Bride, Of High Extraction, eminent for all The Gifts that to a Woman's share could fall; By whom his Nuptials were intirely bless'd, And with a fair and num'rous Issue grac'd, That no Man in a marry'd State could find More real Comforts to content his Mind. Yet the King's Honour was no sooner touch'd, His Pow'r invaded, and his Fame reproach'd, But all those Blessings he declin'd to bear A Loyal part in the approaching War, To shew the World, at such a time of Need, How far his Duty did his Love exceed; Nor did he manfully alone engage His Life, but Fortune on the doubtful Stage, Spar'd no Expence t'encrease the Royal Force, But rais'd, at his own Charge, both Foot and Horse; From the first Troubles took the Martial Plain, And bore a Hero's part, where Crouds were slain, Thro' various Dangers rush'd, all Hazards run, Envy'd by many, but outdone by none: In the most noted Actions had his share, Defended the Head-Gate at Colchester, Charging the Rebels till himself could pin The same, and keep the Foes from forcing in. But when the Roundheads had obtain'd the Town, And shot the two brave Champions of Renown, The Lord who did their General upbraid, In smart Expressions, was their Pris'ner made; Tho' the sharp Slights and Sarcasms which his Tongue, At Fairfax, so unseasonably flung, Was thought to be one reason why he far'd, Amidst their Malice, so unjustly hard; For he and Earl of Norwich were to Windsor sent, From thence, by Order of the Parliament, Where they'd the only Comfort to bemoan Their equal Suff'rings with Duke Hamilton, After some Months were to the Tow'r convey'd, Whence Capel made escape, but was betray'd By the same Villain whom the Lord imploy'd To waft him in his Boat to Lambeth-side. So that, soon after, the Rebellious Court Of Justice cut his Days unjustly short, Who, in the Palace-Yard resign'd his Breath, And with a Christian Brav'ry hug'd his Death. Nor can those Terrors which so much surprise The cow'rdly Wretch, when obvious to his Eyes, E'er daunt the Just, the Vertuous, and the Brave, Who, to a shameful Life, prefer the Grave. A.D. 1648. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Twenty-fourth Year of the Reign of King Charles the First, Anno Dom. 1648. The Army Faction having gain'd their Point, By purging the ambitious Parliament, The Houses now consented to impow'r The Earl of Pembroke, Oxford's Chancellor, Join'd with some Doctors, as reform'd as he, To purge that famous University, Of such as had the least good Word to spare For that detested Book the Common-Pray'r; Also'f Lewd Persons, those that were not Friends, And well inclin'd to serve their pious Ends; Small Faults in such were grounds for loud Complaints, When worse could be no Error in the Saints. In April the Apprentices arose, In order to reform each Bawdy-House About Moorfields, where sev'ral Officers Repair'd, but not in kindness to the Whores, With their Trainbands, but rather to suppress The Tumult, fearing that it might encrease, And be so manag'd as to turn the Tide, In favour of the Presbyterian Side; But the tempestuous Rabble were too hard For the Trainbands, and ston'd the City-Guard, Taking a Colours, which the giddy Rout, All Day, in publick Triumph carr'd about, Put the Lord-May'r into a sudden Fright, Set Guards upon the City-Gates all Night, Till Fairfax did himself with Troops appear, And then the swagg'ring Mob dispers'd in fear. Most part of Wales Under Sir Nicholas Keymish and Sir John Owen. at the same time arose In Arms against the Parliament, as Foes, But, in a Month, were totally subdu'd, After both Sides had wasted show'rs of Blood. No sooner was this Insurrection quell'd, And the Welch Army forc'd to quit the Field, But certain Persons were from Surry sent With a Petition For a Personal Treaty between King and Parliament. to the Parliament, But were so buffeted at Westminster, By the Fanatick Soldiers quarter'd there, That they return'd in vain, with Backs and Bums Well kick'd and beaten, to their Country Homes. This Usage soon was spread, by common Fame, Thro' Kent, who also were about to frame The like Petition, but were now deter'd, Since those of Surry had so hardly far'd, And raising with their utmost speed what Force They could, resolv'd to take another Course, Chusing the Earl of Norwich to preside As Gen'ral, who accordingly comply'd; And sending out some Troops to take in Towns Well situate near the Thames, for Garisons, March'd with the rest tow'rds London, with design To pass the Bridge, with leave, that he might join With Lisle and Lucas on the Essex side; But his intended Passage was deny'd, Which caus'd his Men of Kent to e'ery Day Desert him, till his Force was fall'n away To scarce Five-hundred, with which slender Host The River, to the Isle of Dogs, he cross'd; From whence his little Army had a clear And unmolested March to Colchester, Where the well-meaning Earl obtain'd his Ends, So far as to imbody with his Friends. But Fairfax now march'd into Kent, to find Those straggling Parties that were left behind, Which he soon master'd, and from thence went o'er At Gravesend, with his Troops, toth' Essex Shore; And moving on to Colchester sat down Before it, with the Roy'lists in the Town; Who, tho' for two Months space they made a bold Defence, for want of Succours could not hold The Place, but were compel'd to undergo The cruel Usage of a barb'rous Foe, Lucas and Lisle See their Characters. b'ing sentenc'd to be shot, Like matchless Heroes perish'd on the Spot, After assurance from the Rebels side Of Quarter, which their General deny'd. Capel Lord. See his Character. was close Imprison'd, and allow'd A longer time before they spilt his Blood; Others of Note sequester'd and abus'd, And more like Monsters than like Christians us'd, Duke Hamilton had into England brought, Of scabby Loons, Ten-thousand Horse and Foot, Who saw their wicked Folly, when too late, And would have interpos'd and stop'd the Fate, Which now they saw, too evidently plain, They'd brought upon themselves and Sovereign: But Cromwel marching Norward, from among The Welch, in Arms Eleven-thousand strong, Near Preston In Lancashire. met the Scots, and, in Two Hours, O'erpow'rd the Duke and routed all his Force, Made him his Pris'ner, who, e'relong, was sent Toth' Tower, where the Northern Captive spent Some Months, till try'd and sentenc'd, by the Mock Cabal of Justice, to the Axe and Block. Cromwel, to forward his Designs, march'd on To Scotland, and in Edenborough Town Remain'd, t'ingratiate with a Faction there, Who gave him their Assistance, to prepare The bloody Scheme, by which he was to bring About the dire Destruction of the King. Whilst this was hatching in the Northern Air The Parliament became more mod'rate here, And over-rul'd that rash imprudent Vote Of Non-Addresses to the King, and thought 'Twas now their wisest and securest way, To Treat, whilst Cromwel at a distance lay; Accordingly the Houses both agreed That new Proposals should be sent with speed, Toth' King, wherein the Tyrants did abate Something of their Severities of late; And, when the King had answer'd, did appoint Commissioners, who were to Newport In the Isle of Wight sent, To treat with Suff'ring Majesty, about The peaceable Affair they'd put on foot; But those intrusted manag'd Matters wrong, And about worthless Trifles dodg'd so long, That, in the interim, Cromwel came to Town, And broke the hopeful Measures they'd begun, Who set his Adjutators to impose A bold Remonstrance on the Commons-House, Requiring, That the King forthwith be brought To Justice for the Evils he had wrought: And that the Prince of Wales and his Brother. and Duke, tho' fled away To France, be summon'd on a certain Day T'appear, and that the Houses should proceed In Form, as shoald hereafter be agreed. Thirdly, That Government should settl'd be By Parliamentary Authority: And that Both Houses should a time appoint, Periodical toth' present Parliament: And that all future Parliaments that meet, No longer than a Year or two should sit. And lastly, That a number competent Of the King's Friends be brought to Punishment. Nor did they wait an Answer, but before The Commons-House, to shew their daring Pow'r, Set Guards of Soldiers, who permitted none To enter but the Army Faction, Made some, for fear of Evil-treatment, fly, Whilst they took others into Custody, Suspending Ninety Members 'cause their Votes Had been refus'd against their Friends the Scots, And others who had lately voted down The Vote of Non-Addresses to the Crown; So that the rest who were allow'd to sit, Were all for Cromwel's wicked Purpose fit. A Faction in the City also pack'd A Common-Council, qualify'd to Act Whate'er their Leader Cromwel should exact. Forty of which in all Proceedings were Impow'rd to be superior to the May'r. The first vile treasonable Step they made, Was framing a Petition, where they pray'd, The King to speedy Justice might be brought; Which impious Scroll, that base Fanatick Sot, Tichburn, then May'r, most humbly did present, In Form, to the Rebellious Parliament, Involving the whole City in the Guilt Of Royal Blood, so barbarously spilt. At the same time the Rebels rudely forc'd The King from Newport to the Castle of Hurst, Where his curs'd Foes compel'd him to remain, Till they prepar'd their infamous Divan. In the mean time, that they might safely break The solemn Oaths they'd been oblig'd to take, The Popelike Senate, by an Ordinance, Dissolv'd the Bands of their Allegiance: Then made another, which was worse, to bring To speedy Tryal the Imprison'd King, Voting, that Lords and Commons do declare 'Twas Treason in the Crown to levy War Against the Parliament, to which the Peers Would not consent, which rais'd such sudden Jars Between 'em, that the Commons growing hot, Render'd the Peers quite useless, by a Vote; Therein affirming, that the Pow'r supream Was, by the People, fix'd alone in them, And that all Acts, byth' Commons only made, Were Laws, and should futurely be obey'd. This done the Rebels did in Triumph call Their Hellish Court, that curs'd the wrangling Hall. And how that black Cabal of Villains us'd The best of Princes that was e'er abus'd: And how the patient Monarch did deport Himself before the black Rebellious Court, Is too well known, and is a bloody Scene, Too sad and piercing for a Loyal Pen; A Tragedy too deep, a cruel Deed Too wicked to be writ, or to be read; A barefac'd, impudent, presumptuous Evil, Wherein the Canting Saint out-did the Devil. Therefore since those whose Fathers dip'd their Hands In Blood, that on eternal Record stands, Cannot, without regret, be put in mind Of what has left so great a Curse behind; And that no good Man can delight to see, Or read, so dreadful a Catastrophe; The Martyr's mournful Exit I forbear, And finish with his sacred Character. The End of the Twenty-fourth Year. THE CHARACTER OF THE Royal Martyr. No fetter'd King, but Charles, could ever raise His Fame so high, above the reach of Praise; Nor e'er was Christian Throne before possess'd By any Prince with equal Vertues bless'd: The Laws of God and Man he rightly knew, And squar'd the Actions of his Life thereto; Perform'd all Duties Moral and Divine, And made the Christian with the Monarch shine, Like the Great Ruler of the Heav'nly Throne, (Whence he deriv'd a Title to his own) Postpon'd that Justice which he thought severe, And Mercy shew'd when Punishment was near; For if inclin'd to any Fault, that made His Crown sit heavy on his Royal Head, 'Twas being too Compassionate to such Who thought their Pow'r too little, his too much; A Failing always dang'rous to the Hand That sways the Scepter of the British Land, Where Faction, Beggar-like, if once they find The Prince that Governs of a Giving-Mind, Will still crave on, to further be supply'd, And murmur, as if injur'd, when deny'd. Thus, like base Misers, thankless for their Store, Ne'er bend a Knee, except to pray for more. No David greater Piety could boast, Or in a stricter Conscience put his Trust; For neither Bus'ness, Pleasure, or Distress, Could hold him from Religious Offices, Or, at fix'd Hours, engage him to delay, Or wave, the sacred Duties of the Day, Which he perform'd, as all Records agree, With such a Saint-like Warmth and Purity, That his Devotion shew'd his Heav'nly Mind, So full of Zeal, so totally resign'd To God, as if his Eyes, impow'rd by Grace, Amidst his Pray'rs, beheld his Maker's Face; And that he was not only born to sway A Scepter, but to teach the World to pray; And, by his Meek and Holy Life, to shew, Like Moses, he was Prince and Prophet too. Nor did his Moral Vertues disagree With his unfeign'd exemplar Piety; For e'ery Vice was hateful to his Breast, And sinful Pleasures nauseous to his Tast; No beauteous Comets that adorn'd his Court, Could influence his Eyes or warm his Heart, His Continence despis'd their winning Smiles, And arm'd his Breast against their Arts and Wiles, That his Example kept his Peers in awe, More than Religious Preaching or the Law, And caus'd those Vices which so oft profane The Throne, and in the Courts of Princes Reign, To be accounted odious by the Great, Who did around such Royal Vertue wait. No Irreligious Jesting did he love, Tho' cover'd with that Wit which some approve, But in the chearful'st Seasons would exact, In Holy Things; due Rev'rence and Respect. Nor in his sacred Presence would he bear The Knave, the Drunkard, or Adulterer, But, with a Saint-like purity of Soul, Abhor'd all Actions that were base or foul. Thus was he bless'd with such a Godlike Mind, As if by Heav'n peculiarly design'd To be the Second Great Reformer of Mankind. Tho' born in that misled unhappy Land, Where Moloch's Priests have such ascendance gain'd, That they've advanc'd, by outward shews of Grace, Their Calves-head Idol of Geneva Brass Moloch was a brazen Idol, having a Body like a Man, and a Head like a Calf., Yet was his purer Faith intirely clear Of all those Errors that had footing there, Harb'ring no Tenets in his Royal Breast, But what the Church he govern'd here profess'd, And wisely steer'd his Christian Conscience free From Pop'ry, and her Child Presbytery, Oft being heard to solemnly declare, He thought the Holy Church, beneath his Care, The most reform'd that could on Earth be found, Her Worship pure, and Doctrine truly sound, In whose Defence, like that great God and Man, Who bless'd us with the Name of Christian, He sacrific'd a Life which scorn'd to stray From that Great King of Kings who led the way. His Politicks from Scripture he deriv'd, And, like a Christian Monarch rul'd and liv'd, Strictly maintaining, by the Laws of Heav'n, The Pow'r which God into his Hands had giv'n. No British Sov'reign better knew than he, The just and legal Bounds of Majesty, Or kept, with more unspotted Innocence, Within the Limits of that sacred Fence, Till daring Rebels tore the Sep'ment down, And with inhumane Rage attack'd the Throne; Forcing the most abus'd of Kings to draw His Sword, and have recourse to Nature's Law. Till then, and after, no Forgiving Prince, That ever rul'd the Land before or since, Could have a Heart more peacefully inclin'd, Or tow'rds his People bear a juster Mind. No crafty Machiavelian Arts possest The pious Closets of his Royal Breast; But with a Dove-like Innocence he reign'd, And by Religious Rules his Crown sustain'd; Till Faction first compel'd him to submit To Councils not so truly Just as Fit, And at length forc'd him to unsheath his Sword In such a Quarrel that his Soul abhor'd, Which they unjustly charg'd upon the Throne, When both the Faults intirely were their own. But 'tis a Rule with Faction first to gain, By cunning sly Petitions, what they can; And when they've Pow'r sufficient to molest Their Prince, to impudently claim the rest; Which, if not granted, they conspire his Fall, And call him Tyrant 'cause he gives not all. Few Kings were better qualify'd to guide A Throne, tho' ruin'd by rebellious Pride; His Courage firm, his Understanding clear, And well proportion'd to his Royal Sphere; His Penetration deep, his Judgment great And quick in all Emergencies of State; Yet was so easy to be work'd upon By those he trusted to assist the Throne, That, thro' Self-diffidence, he'd oft Reverse His own Opinion, to rely on worse. Thus, upon Friends depend in nice Affairs, When Royal Wisdom far exceeded theirs. So Confidence o'er Modesty prevails, And with less Merit often turns the Scales. No Hannibal, before a Grecian Host, More Pers'nal Brav'ry in the Field could boast, Or Danger in the heat of Battle face, With greater Courage, Majesty, and Grace: Nor any Prince with cooler Temper bear The Turns and Changes of deceitful War; Where the Just Cause, as well as Stronger Side, With the best Heads and bravest Hands supply'd, For Reasons to the Highest only known, Are oft by fatal Accidents o'erthrown. Nor is it wondrous, since we daily see The Just afflicted, whilst the Wicked, free From Sorrow, flourish in Prosperity. His Person was in e'ery part compleat, Truly Becoming his Majestick Seat; And in his Looks the Christian World might see A sweet and Saviour-like Humility: His Temper mercifully kind and good, Flowing with Bounty, Love, and Gratitude: His Recreations void of all Offence: His Pleasures circumscrib'd with Innocence: His Appetites and Passions in a full Subjection to the Christian Holy Rule, Squaring the Actions of his anxious Life, By that great Law, in spight of Civil Strife. And when rebellious Furies drag'd him down, With barb'rous Hands from his Imperial Throne, And damn'd themselves, in envious Crouds, to load Their Malice with the Guilt of Royal Blood, No Saint or Martyr ever stoop'd to Fate, With Christian Patience more divinely great. In short, all Vertues center'd in his Breast, Of Friends and Masters he was deem'd the best; The faithful'st Husband, may be justly said To be, that ever blest a Nuptial Bed; The kindest Father to his Royal Brood, And a sincere true Christian to his God: Nor could the World produce, or Throne sustain A more compleat accomplish'd Gentleman: And tho' the most unfortunate on Earth, No Court could boast a Prince of greater Worth, Whose blooming Fate will find an annual Spring, As long as Nations know the Name of King: And at the last Great Day, when we shall all Be try'd, damn Thousands that conspir'd his Fall. For if fresh Crimes can wash away the Guilt Of Royal Blood, with so much Malice spilt, And Rebels can be sav'd that ne'er repent, Then all are happy and the Devil's a Saint. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. III. A.D. 1649. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the First Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1649. Including the odd Months of the foregoing Year. No sooner had the trait'rous Court destroy'd The King, to satiate their Revenge and Pride, But the same Day January the 30th the Rump, to circumvent His Issue, made an Act of Parliament, Importing, no Man should presume or dare To proclaim, publish, mention or declare Charles Stuart, call'd the Prince of Wales, the Son Of the late King, as Sov'reign of the Throne: Or promote any Person to command, As King, the English and the Irish Land. Establishing at once themselves to be The only new Supreme Authority; And, as amidst their Rage, they had before, Debar'd the Lords of sharing in the Pow'r; So now February the 5th. they, by a Vote, declar'd the House Of Peers, to useless be, and dangerous. Soon after pass'd an Act, that each of those, Who'd been secluded for appearing Foes To th'Vote of Non-Addresses, should remain, Unqualify'd to ever sit again, And by these Methods did at once translate The Monarchy, t'an Oligarchick State. As Strolling Conjures turn one great Ball, By Slight of Hand, into a croud of small. This done, the House thought fit to constitute A Council, call'd, of State Consisting of Forty Persons. to execute The Rump's Commands, now thinking they'd the sole Supreme Authority, beyond Controul, Believing they'd the Army at their Beck; But crafty Cromwel knew 'twas a Mistake; However, humour'd them so well, that none Could guess he aim'd to make the Rule his own: So that the Rump a Declaration made, To shew they now resolv'd to be obey'd, Making firm Promise, in a smoothing Clause, To stand by th'Nations Fundamental Laws, And to preserve, from all Oppression free, The Peoples Lives, Estates and Liberty: At the same time erected that High Court Of Justice, having no example for't; By which they after sentenc'd to the Block, Holland Earl of, Lord Capel, Hamilton the Duke, Altho' 'twas known the English Laws provide, That Peers shall by their Peers alone be try'd. But proud Usurpers, tho' they promise fair, Have no regard to what they say or swear; For 'tis a Maxim, What is basely gain'd, By the same Methods must be still maintain'd. The Rump proceeded next to change the Coin, That the King's Image might no longer shine, Hoping the Stamp they had devis'd anew, Might raze out both his Name and Mem'ry too: But his Heroick Deeds and Suff'rings hard Will live, whilst Vertue finds the least regard. They also now consider'd, who'd be proud To serve 'em as Ambassadors abroad; A dang'rous Post in any Foreign Court, After they'd done their lawful Prince such hurt: However, they, at length, made shift to find Such Tools as were accomplish'd to their Mind, Whose Principles or Pride still made 'em run Those Hazards wiser Heads were glad to shun. In March they also perfected their High Blood-thirsty-Court at Westminster, to try The three foremention'd Lords, who follow'd close Their injur'd Master, to their last repose Were beheaded March 9 in the Old Palace Yard.. Which frighted many, to forsake the Land, Who, on the King's Behalf, had born Command. Nor were they terrify'd with groundless Fear, Since 'twas propos'd, as plainly did appear, To a Court Martial, that they all might be Destroy'd at once by cruel Massacre; But being put to th'Vote, the No's, to shew Their Mercy, only carr'd the Point by Two. They also fin'd the City Lord the Mayor, Two-thousand Pounds and turn'd him out his Chair March 24., For Two Months space confin'd him to the Tow'r, Because, when they'd abolish'd Kingly Pow'r, His Lordship had more Grace than to proclaim The Act they'd made to overthrow the same. About this time they also laid aside Their Monthly Fast, by reason they'd destroy'd The King, for whose Destruction they had pray'd, And fasted till they'd reach'd his Royal Head. But when the Work was done they thought 'twas time To feast and triumph in their barb'rous Crime. How vile a Wretch is Man, who, whilst he breaks The Laws of Heaven, Supplication makes, And prays that an offended God will bless And prosper his audacious Wickedness? The Rump, by their proceedings, which were thought Severe, a publick Odium quickly brought Upon their Government, and lost apace The Peoples Love, till dwindl'd to Disgrace, That their Dependance wholly was upon The Army, which they had not made their own, But were at Cromwel's Beck and free to do Whatever he requir'd, and that he knew, Who carry'd fair, but never fail'd to lay Fast hold of all Occasions in his way, To spur the Rump to Matters that might prove A farther less'ning of the Peoples Love. That when conducive to his Ends, he might Dissolve them, and the Publick say 'twas right, And foolishly, alas, believe 'twas done More for the Common-Good than for his own. The discontented Scots now thought it hard, The Rump to them should have no more regard; Therefore began to levy Arms, to shew They meant to challenge what they thought their due The Irish Popish Rebels too, for want Of timely Care, were grown predominant. The English Army had been also taught So well, by th'Adjutators, that they thought, Among the Godly, they had right to share The Lands, which, by the Rump, sequester'd were. And therefore form'd, to propagate new Jars, A Party which were call'd the Levellers. At the same time the Rump were low in Coin, And wanted Summs to forward their Design: So that thrice Thirty-thousand Pounds they laid Upon the People, Monthly to be paid; Which gauling Tax was levy'd with pretence, To give their present Army maintenance: Kind flatt'ring Letters also they dispatch'd To th'Scots, who were too cunning to be catch'd With such deceitful Baits, design'd alone To wean their Int'rest from the Royal Son. The Kirk now seeming fond of standing by, For their own sakes, His present Majesty; And therefore sent back Word, that they would hear Nothing from any House at Westminster, That had no King, nor Lords, without whose joint Concurrence there could be no Parliament; Sending their Agents Commissioners., by the next fair Wind, T'acquaint the banish'd King, that they design'd To levy, for his Royal use, a Force Of Sev'nteen-thousand Foot, Six-thousand Horse; Tho' wise discerning Majesty well knew, They'd not his Int'rest, but their own, in view. The Rump, to rescue Ireland, did appoint Eleven Reg'ments to be thither sent, Hoping thereby they also should abate The Army-Faction, grown perverse of late; But now the Soldiers finding, that instead Of sharing Lands that had been forfeited, They were commanded to endure the toil Of further War in a dissettl'd Isle, Flatly refus'd to march, replying, they For Reformation fought, and not for Pay; And therefore would not stir till they had done The Godly Work they had so well begun: One Regiment presuming to cashier, Near Sal'sbury, their Leading Officer Their Colonel., Marching away to Burford, where they join'd Three Reg'ments more that were of equal mind: But Gen'ral Fairfax, and Lieutenant General. Nol, Sent Reynolds, with superior Force, to fall Upon the Mutineers, who soon suppress'd The Faction, kill'd most part, and took the rest; The Leaders by a Martial Court b'ing try'd, To Death were sentenc'd, and pursuant dy'd; By which severe Rewards of their Offence, They brought the whole into Obedience. This done, the Gen'rals did to Oxford move, Where the Learn'd Heads, to manifest their Love, Made 'em both Doctors of the Civil Law, Who, when thus honour'd, did from thence withdraw To London, where the Cits oblig'd their Guests With costly Presents and expensive Feasts. Thus Slaves and Cowards, whom no Vows can bind, Are always to successful Villains kind; For present safety any Cause espouse, Applaud the Victor and adorn his Brows. The punish'd Army being now content T'obey, Eleven Regiments were sent To Ireland, under Oliver's Command, Appointed Chief Under the Title of Governour. of that divided Land; Who, tho' Great Ormond for the King was Lord- Lieutenant, yet he soon was overpow'rd, And all the struggling Parties there subdu'd, By Cromwel's Cruelty, who spar'd no Blood, But by the Sword, within a Year or less, Almost extirpated the Irish Race; Leaving what he'd not finish'd, to be done By Ireton, who, by Marriage, was his Son; But the Plague snatch'd him to his Grave, before He'd time to barb'rously exert the Pow'r His Fath'r-in-Law had left him to compleat The Work, for which the Son was truly fit. The King, unhappy Prince, who's glad to shift His Quarters, Paris for the Hague had left, Whither the English Rump, or Commons-House, Had sent their Agent, Doctor Dorislaus, Whose barb'rous bloody Hand, and black'ning Pen Had drawn the Charge against his Sovereign; But the first Night he came into the Town, As he at Supper sate, was seiz'd upon By Cavaliers, who gave him his Reward, And left him stab'd with a revengeful Sword, Th'Assassinators all escaping free, Without Obstruction or Discovery. Soon after Ascham, who was also sent To Madrid, by his Lords the Parliament, A Scholar, who had written in defence Of his good Masters Disobedience, Was, in like manner, slain by three or four, And bleeding left upon his Chamber-Floor. The Rump proceeded next to share the Lands And Summs they'd wrested out of Loyal Hands; Enacted an Engagement to be ta'en, And sworn by e'ery individual Man, Who thereby promis'd to be just and true Toth' Commonwealth of England, as 'twas new Establish'd, without King or House of Lords; This b'ing the purport of the Rump's own Words: Who also banish'd twenty Miles from Town, All Loyalists who'd honour for the Crown, Forbidding them, on Penalties, to roam Beyond the Limits of Five Miles from home. Thus when two Parties struggle who shall tow'r, And they who have least Right usurp the Pow'r, The suff'ring Side must be enslav'd, in course, For all are Tyrants who command by force. The End of the First Year and odd Months. THE CHARACTER OF Sergeant Bradshaw, President of the High Court of Justice. A surly proud Perverter of the Laws, An impious Judge in a nefarious Cause, Who sate enthron'd in that Infernal Court, Which made the best of Monarch's Lives its sport, Treating his pious Sov'reign at the Bar, More rudely than a common Prisoner; And by the Hellish Part the Traytor play'd, The rank invet'rate Speeches that he made Upon the Bench, proclaim'd himself to be The Devil's Equal in Barbarity, Having no sence of Duty, Honour, Shame, Or any Vertue that can bear a Name; But was so well accomplish'd and prepar'd, For that vile murd'ring Task wherein he shar'd, That Lucifer himself could not have been More proudly active in so black a Scene; As if he meant to win the hottest place In Hell b' unprecedented Wickedness; Such that no Age before had ever known, And never should hereafter be outdone: For which, as in his Grave his Body found No rest, but justly rotted above Ground. So let his Soul, when Death shall lose his Sting, Be judg'd with the like Mercy that he judg'd his King. THE General CHARACTER OF THE High Court of Justice. Had Lucifer, in Malice to the Good, Shook off his Chains and left his curs'd abode, To make the Fall of Man the more compleat, Beneath the umbrage of a pious Cheat; And had he rang'd the Universe to find A dire Cabal, accomplish'd to his Mind, The envious Fiend, to gratify his Spight, Could not have muster'd, in his tiresome Flight, A Sett of Ruffains, fitter to effect The wicked'st Plots his Malice could project. No Jewish Sanhedrim was ever, sure, So gravely Vile, so barb'rously Demure, As that Sham-Court, who had the Face to mock And doom ev'n God's Vicegerent to the Block; Patch'd up of moody stubborn Hypocrites, Hurry'd by Zeal and Pride beyond their Wits; Who, in their Looks, wore outward Signs of Grace, But in their Hearts were infamously base: Born in dark Corners, as obscurely bred, And far from Home, to seek their Fortunes, fled; Where they were nurs'd in a dissenting Way, And taught, perhaps, at once, to thieve and pray: By Blood and Treason rais'd beneath the Wing Of daring Cromwel, who pursu'd the King Into the Jaws of this nefarious Brood, Who, like their Leader, thirsted for his Blood, That they might raise themselves to Wealth and Pow'r, Whose Fathers had been Scoundrels long before; Honour'd with here and there some wicked Man Of Note, drawn in to grace the black Divan. Of such as these that Heath'nish Court was fram'd, By whom the best of Monarchs was condemn'd To suffer, for a just and brave Defence Of his wrong'd Kingdoms and his Innocence: But Heaven, to revenge the Martyr's Cause, Brought some beneath the Justice of the Laws; Whilst others, for the precious Blood they'd spilt, Like Cain, were doom'd to wander in their Guilt, That, e're they dy'd their Consciences might feel The Stings and Terrors of a future Hell. Curse on those Teachers whose rebellious Tongues Applaud and Countenance such daring Wrongs. How can they say that they believe in God, Who prosecute their Ends in Christian Blood? THE CHARACTER OF Colonel Hewson, The suppos'd Murderer of the King. A one-ey'd Wretch, obscurely Born and Bred, When young, of Crispin's gentle Craft by Trade; But when the Civil Wars broke out, forsook His Garret, and to Arms himself betook; And proving of a Nature bold and base, For any Mischief fit, improv'd apace, Till he, at length, grew noted for a smart Audacious Fellow, and in Arms expert; Who having, in his Youth, acquir'd the Cant And true deportment of a Factious Saint; Abounded also in the Gift of Pray'r, And other Knacks, which then encourag'd were; That from a worthless Scoundrel he, in time, Did to the Office of a Col'nel climb; And in the black Tribunal had the Grace, Among the barb'rous Crew to take his place, And in disguise, as 'tis reported, stood Upon the Scaffold when his Sov'reign's Blood Was made a Sacrifice, to quench the Thirst Of those whose Race are by his Fall accurs'd; Nor do some Writers scruple to allow, That Hewson was the Wretch who gave the Blow, Which crush'd the best of Monarchs and of Men, Too Just to Suffer, and too Good to Reign; But when Hypocrisy shall pass for Grace, And e'ery Rogue puts on a Saintlike Face, Well may the strictest Vertue fare the worst, And the most blameless Christian suffer first. A.D. 1650. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Second Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second. Anno Dom. 1650. Montrose the Scot, who had such Wonders done, In Forty Five, to serve the sinking Throne, And had, pursuant to the King's Command, Disbanded, and for safety left the Land, Was with a new Commission now sent o'er, By Charles the Second to his Native Shore, Where, in the North, he'd Landed with some Troops Of Dutch and Germans, tho' but few, in hopes The hardy Highlanders would early join His slender Force, and back his good Design; But Great Argyle, i'th' absence of Montrose, Had us'd so much Severity with those Who'd acted for the King, that they were grown More shy of vent'ring to assist the Throne; And tho' some Thousands did come in to aid Montrose, they were so far dispirited, That when they heard a Party was at hand, Of Horse, some Reg'ments under Straghan's Command, And David Lesley with an Army in the Rear, Approaching, they forsook Montrose in fear, Who thereupon, for want of equal Force, Was routed with his Troops of Foreigners. Soon after taken in a Clown's Disguise, And made a much lamented Sacrifice May 2d., With many more brave Officers, who shar'd Their Leader's Fate, too barbarously hard: Among the rest an Officer of Note, One Whitford Colonel. was to Execution brought; Who said, they only took him off because He'd been the Death of Doctor Dorislaus, For joining with those Rogues who had destroy'd The best of Kings that Scotland e'er enjoy'd. Upon which words the Magistrates delay'd The Col'nel's Execution, till they'd made The State acquainted with the same, who gave Their Pardon, and preserv'd him from the Grave, Left on themselves they should the Odium bring, Of fav'ring those who had destroy'd the King. Thus did the Scots, by giving Life, reward The bold Revenge of Loyal Whitford's Sword; As if the Death of Dorislaus had been An Act of humane Vertue, not a Sin; Yet so far the Reproach is surely theirs, They sold their Sov'reign to his Murderers, Altho' so much asham'd to share the Guilt Of Royal Blood, their Fellow-Rebels spilt. But in a false Arrest, pray who's most base, The Bailiff or the Setter that betrays. The discontented Scots b'ing now in Arms, And the Rump Rulers under great Alarms, Cromwel, unsent for, thought it time to come From Ireland, to promote his Ends at home, Accordingly arriv'd June the 6th., tho' he had sent First Notice to his Lords the Parliament; But for their Answer was too wise to stay, For fear the House should his Return delay: Who, when he came, was welcom'd by the Rump, And publickly appear'd in mighty Pomp, As being now their only Martial Friend, On whom the Rump for safety could depend; For Gen'ral Fairfax, who was known to be A Cordial Zealot in Presbytery, In Cromwel's Absence had so tutor'd been, By the Industrious Ministers therein, That Conscience would not give him leave to lead An Army 'gainst the Kirk beyond the Tweed; But, like a Pious Saint much rather chose To throw up his Commission, than oppose The Scots, tho' he'd the Grace to reconcile Rebellion to his Conscience all the while, And never scruple to commit the worst Of Crimes, by which his Race could be accurs'd. So Rogues who steal and murder for Relief, Will scorn to rob or hurt a Brother Thief. Thus Fairfax had no sooner left the Host, But Cromwel was advanc'd into his Post, And of the Irish Forces had Command, As well as those within his Native Land; Which answer'd the Design he'd form'd before, And was a suddain Step tow'rds Sov'reign Pow'r. Thus Prosp'rous Villains fortunately rise To Greatness, and obtain the wish'd for Prize, By unseen Accidents that clear the Way, And give them Pow'r to make their Slaves obey. The King, e're this time, from the Belgick Coast, Had safely to the North of Scotland crost; From whence he'd been conducted in great Pomp To Edenbrough, which much allarm'd the Rump; Tho' things, as yet, were not agreed between The crafty Scots and their new Sovereign; Who, tho' he yielded almost to enslave The Throne, they still had something more to crave, Till tir'd with fresh Demands he left the Town, And Norward mov'd; but was no sooner gone, E're they sent Messengers to humbly pray The King to fav'r'em with a longer stay; Which kind Request had he deny'd, they'd Horse Sufficient to have brought him back by force: So that, in truth, their Monarch was no more, At present, than their Royal Prisoner. However, they agreed, the King comply'd With hard Conditions on the Royal Side, Sharp as the Terms his Father had thought fit To yield to, when restrain'd i'th' Isle of Wight; For tho' the Scots had made it their Pretence To raise an Army in the King's Defence, Yet neither He, nor any Loyal Friend, Was, in the same, to hold the least Command: Nor were the English Servants he had brought, Allow'd t'attend his Person, as they ought. So that it seem'd as if the Ills they'd done By th'Father, they intended to the Son; And only meant, in short, to make the most They could, between their Sov'reign and their Host. As Misers serve the Needy in Distress, To make their Woes more great, instead of less, By preying on their blind Unhappiness. Cromwel, tho' Fairfax would not fight the Kirk Of Scotland, gladly undertook the Work, And with an Army march'd to Berwick Town, Where he dispers'd his Declaration; In which he did most solemnly affirm, That, tho' in Arms, he meant the Scots no harm, Nor had he any Quarrel to decide With them, but such Malignants as annoy'd The Publick Peace, by aiming to restore Charles Stuart to the Crown and Kingly Pow'r; That therefore he was ready to receive, By Conf'rence, Satisfaction, or to give The same therein; or would in Battle try Which Side did on the Justest Cause rely. The Pious Scots reply'd, they did not mean To prosecute the Int'rest of the King, Till he had first acknowledg'd each Abuse And sinful Error of his wicked House, That Satisfaction, by the help of Heav'n, Might to God's People of both Lands be given. In this their Answer may be plainly seen, The bad Condition that the King was in; And that they only meant to be his Friends, So far as 'twas conducive to their Ends; And that, at last, his fatal Usage there, Would have prov'd equal to his Father's here, Had they proceeded smoothly, as they hop'd They should; but Providence their Progress stop'd, And humbl'd them by Rebels, who their own Base Treachery had rais'd above the Throne. Cromwel no sooner had receiv'd their Cant, In answer to his Declaration sent, But he march'd on to Edenborough Town, Thence to Dunbar, and rambl'd up and down, In hopes to fight the Scots, but could not find The Northern Army posted to his Mind; Who led him such a Dance, till he almost Had starv'd, as well as tir'd his English Host; That having by this Means impair'd his Strength, And quite despairing of Success, at length Resolv'd, by Land or Sea, to steer his Course For England, with his hungry murm'ring Force. To this Condition had victorious Noll, Whose Conduct to this Day the Saints extol, Brought his whole Army, that in case the Scots Had not reliev'd him by their foolish Blots, His Laurels all had from his Brows been rent, And ended in his Shame and Punishment; But Fortune, who'd been Nodding, timely rowz'd, And sav'd the darling Hero she'd espous'd; For Noll retiring, whilst his Northern Foes, In Number much superior, follow'd close; Till to a Ridge of Hills he came, which lay Near to Dunbar, inclining tow'rds the Sea, Where Cromwel aiming to secure a Pass At the Village of Copperspeith. Which the Scots car'd not that he should possess, Repuls'd the Party, who at first begun To shrink, but the Foot boldly coming on, With such couragious warmth maintain'd the Fight, Till the broad-sworded Scots were put to Flight. Thus in one Battle were they quite undone, Altho' in number two, at least, to one; When if they had no Hazard run at all, Their not Engaging had been Cromwel's Fall. This Victory, however, prov'd of use To th'King, who'd none but Enemies to lose, And made the worsted Scots more humble grow, Who were so proud before their Overthrow. Cromwel to Edenborough march'd forthwith, Possess'd it, fortify'd the Town of Leith, Took in all Castles and Strong-Holds of use, That lay commodious 'twixt the Frith and us; Which ancient River was the Bounds between The English Host without and Scots within; Who now began to low'r their Pride apace, And shew the King a new submissive Face, Voted that Royalists should bear Command I'th' Army to be levy'd out of hand; Whilst Lucky Cromwel sent into the West Of Scotland, a Detachment of his best And most experienc'd Troops, to fall upon Two famous Presbyterians, Kerr and Straughan, Who then were levying Forces to secure The Kirk, so much in dread of Cromwel's Pow'r. During which time the Scots vouchsaf'd to Crown The King, with great Humility, at Schone; Not thro' Obedience, or so much to please Themselves, as to amuse their Enemies. The Rump, to low'r the Presbyterian Pride, Gave Liberty to all the Sects beside, Levy'd a new small Army, and withal Made Harrison their Major-General, A Zealot who profess'd himself to be A bold Assertor of Fifth Monarchy; Who with the other rigid Sects agreed To raise three Regiments Two of Horse and one of Foot.; for being freed From Presbyterian Tyranny, whose Yoke Did all the other Godlier Saints provoke. Also the Rump, to shew their poor Revenge, Pull'd the King's Statue down at the Exchange, And in its place express'd their Malice thus, Exit Tyrannus Regum ultimus. Embassadors from Portugal and Spain, Came in to Compliment the Rump's new Reign, And, to the shame of those that sent 'em o'er, Basely acknowledg'd their Rebellious Pow'r. The rest of the ill time was spent this Year, In persecuting those that Loyal were, Sequestring the Estates of some, to raise Their own low Fortunes by unchristian ways, And executing others by their Laws, The better to support their wretched Cause. Well may the giddy Croud be led astray, To trample down those Kings they should obey, Since neighb'ring Princes, to their Scandal, own Such Rebels as usurp their Monarch's Throne. The End of the Second Year. THE Marquis of Montrose's CHARACTER Bred up in France to Arms, and there prefer'd To be a Captain in the King's Life-Guard, Was by Duke Hamilton, then great in Pow'r, Invited to the Court of England o'er; Where he, at first, was by the Jealous Throne, In those bad Times but coolly look'd upon; Which so disgusted his Heroick Mind, That he the Northern Covenanters join'd: But when he found that their Designs were meant To overturn the King and Government, He to the Throne submissive Letters wrote, And timely open'd their invidious Plot; But these were from the Royal Pocket lost, Or stol'n by some ill hand, as 'twas suppos'd, And Copies sent to Scotland, that Montrose At Edenburgh was shut in Prison close, Where he lay long confin'd e'er he obtain'd His Liberty; which he no sooner gain'd, But he took Post for England, and apply'd Toth' Queen, who did at Bridlington reside, And laid before Her Majesty the State Of Scotland, and the Means to obviate Their Ill Designs, but he was overthrown In all his good Advice, by Hamilton. However, with a small but gallant Force, At most but Fourteen-hundred Foot and Horse, He enter'd Scotland, took in sev'ral Towns, And gave Relief to divers Garisons, Lodging his Men therein, then travell'd round The Land in private, by which means he found The Strength of e'ery Place, and how the Mind Of e'ery Clan stood well or ill inclin'd. At length he form'd a little active Train Of Irish, and his Friends the Athol Men; With which small handful he the Scots amaz'd, And made 'em fly before him as he pleas'd: Did such true Fortitude and Conduct show, That both the Kingdoms justly may allow, No braver Worthy ever drew his Sword In Battle, to support his Sov'reign Lord: None with less Force could raise a greater Storm, Or mightier Wonders in the Field perform, Needing no safer Armour for his Breast, Than the Heroick Vertues he possess'd; Fearless of Danger when it seem'd most great, As if he slighted Life and courted Fate, Or that he fought to merit Heav'ns applause, By dying bravely in so just a Cause; For none could in the Face of Death defy Superior Strength with nobler Gallantry; As if he thought 'twas Cowardice to beat A Foe whose Forces were not twice as great; Yet when he long had triumph'd in Success, And chas'd the Rebel Scots from place to place, Capricious Fortune, in her Freaks, to show The strange vicissitude of things below, Suffer'd the Hero, who had over-run Half Scotland, to be foil'd and overthrown By David Lesley, making his Retreat Into the Highlands, after his Defeat; Where he, in time, repair'd his shatter'd Pow'r, And grew almost as prosp'rous as before: But the King flying to the Scottish Host, In hopes of Safety when his All was lost, Did, by their Instigation, send Command To his best Friend, the Marquis, to disband; Who did his Troops accordingly dismiss, And, much concern'd, withdrew beyond the Seas. After the best of Kings had felt the stroak Of Fate, and with his Purple dy'd the Block, Return'd to Scotland with a slender Guard Of Hamburgh Troops, and for the Son declar'd; But failing of Success, for want of Force, Was quickly routed with his Foreign Horse; Soon after taken, infamously us'd, Carted, expos'd, and by the Croud abus'd: All which he bore with such a comely Grace, As if no Wrongs could change his Mind or Face; Was in the common Jayl a Pris'ner made, From thence in Triumph to their Senate led, And there reproach'd, to their eternal Shame, By those who oft had trembl'd at his Name: Then by their Guides in Prison terrify'd, Not to assist his Soul, but shew their Pride; Thence, in the most indecent manner, drawn To the vile Place of Execution, Where a tall Gallows, thirty Foot in height, Was proudly rear'd to manifest their spite. Where the bold Marquis told his Foes, that stood Around the Place to triumph in his Blood, That he was prouder far to think his Head, Where they design'd, should stand aloft when dead, Than that his Picture, by the King's good Grace, Should in his Royal Chamber find a place; And that it was so little his Concern, To think his Quarters should their Gates adorn, That he could wish he'd Flesh enough, that some Might hang in e'ery Town in Christendom, That when his Soul was fled, his Limbs might be Display'd as Ensigns of his Loyalty. Thus when Brave Spirits fall within the Pow'r Of those that trembl'd at their Names before, The cruel Wrongs intended to their Shame, Instead of less'ning, thro' the World proclaim Their Vertues and Immortalize their Name. THE CHARACTER OF DAVID LESLEY, Who succeeded the Lord Leven in the Command of the Scotch Army. A good Horse Officer, but scarce could boast Sufficient Conduct for the highest Post; Yet had he been successful in the Fall Of Brave Montrose, a greater General; Whose Foreign Troops by Numbers he o'erpow'rd, And made that Earl the Captive of his Sword. But when the Scots did for the King declare, And with the English Parliament made War, Lesley, who in that Service was employ'd, Was left by Fortune when he chang'd his Side, And did at Worc'ster Battle basely lose The Laurels he had won against Montrose; And from the Field, with Troops unbroken, fled, Whilst Loyal Thousands in the Contest bled; Himself b'ing taken Pris'ner in his Flight Tow'rds Scotland, after the unhappy Fight; Whilst prosp'rous Cromwel triumph'd in Success, And forc'd the King to find a hiding-place; Many suspecting Lesley had betray'd His Trust, and that the faulty Steps he'd made Were wilful; but the Hardships he endur'd As the long Season that he dwelt immur'd, Rescu'd his Reputation from so base A Calumny, and wip'd off the Disgrace. Thus Fortune, whose uncertain Smiles we court, Oft favours Fools, and makes the Brave her Sport. Who then to Day's Success would proudly boast, Since all, the next Adventure, may be lost. A.D. 1651. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Third Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1651. The Parliament of Scotland Assembled April 11. now thought fit To make some certain Acts that might unite Themselves the better, and injoin a more Sufficient Duty to the Sov'reign Pow'r, Which the misguided Loons had long been taught, By their Rebellious Guides, to violate. The King, with the Scotch Host at Sterling lay, Expecting Reinforcements e'ery Day; Which then were levy'd, that his Arms might be Superior to his Neighbouring Enemy, Who sev'ral times from Edenborough-Town, Led forth his Rebels to oppose the Crown; But a deep River lying 'twixt the Foes, Which Cromwel could not ford, prevented Blows: Nor could he, without too much Hazard, force The Passes, guarded by the Northern Horse; But was oblig'd to wait, till Boats were sent From London, and Newcastle, with Intent To Waft his Forces o'er, in hopes they might Oblige the King, and his Scotch Troops to Fight. No sooner were the Boats in order brought, But Colonel of Foot. Overton pass'd over with his Foot, Four able Troops, who'd oft their Valour shown, And a Foot Regiment besides his own, Who soon were strengthen'd with as many more, Which Major-Gen'ral Lambert carry'd o'er, That near Six-thousand did the River pass, And unoppos'd secur'd a Landing-place. At length a Party of the Scots came on, Commanded by the treach'rous Sir John Brown, In order to engage 'em and oppose The further Passage of their English Foes; But Overton and Lambert, in the Fight, Prov'd much too hard for the deceitful Knight, Who not b'ing hearty in the Cause, betray'd His Forces, as by Clarendon 'tis said, That on the spot Two-thousand Scots were slain, And Sixteen-hundred in the Battle ta'en. Which being done, successful Cromwel pass'd The Frith, and march'd with all convenient Haste, Before St. Johnston, to invade the Town, E're the Scotch Parliament from thence were flown, But hearing of the Slaughter he had made, They all for Safety to Dundee were fled. During which time, the King had steer'd his Course From Sterling, with his small remaining Force, Tow'rds England, which surprizing News was brought To Cromwel's Ear, who, tho' he lik'd it not, Resolv'd to take the Town, e'er he would stir, Altho' the King was three Days March before The King began his March from Sterling, the last of July.. Accordingly, next Day, he took the Place, Then gave the King and his Scotch Army chase, Consisting of 4500. Who reach'd the Town of Worc'ster August 22. e're the Foe Could overtake them, as they hop'd to do: The English Rebels joining as they went, With fresh Recruits to their Assistance sent, Till Cromwel's Army did, at least, contain, In number, Forty-thousand able Men; Whilst the much Weaker and Unskilful Host About 13000. Of Scotland, made not half that Strength at most; So that, for want of Judgment, or of Care In raising up such Works as needful were, The King was soon defeated, and compell'd To quit the Town, as well as fly the Field September the 3d.; Most of the Scots b'ing Kill'd, or Pris'ners made, Except some Horse, who back tow'rds Scotland fled, With David Lesley Gen'ral, who was thought To manage less sincerely than he ought, Tho' he himself was taken by the Way, And under a long harsh Confinement lay, Whilst many Peers of both the Nations shar'd The like Misfortune, and as hardly far'd. The King, for present Safety, took his Flight From Worc'ster into Warwick-shire by Night, Drop'd Lesley and his Troops upon the Road, And crept, when Light, into a neighb'ring Wood, Commanding two, wh'attended, to retire, After they'd crop'd his Hair to his desire, Trusting himself alone, in this Disguise, To Heav'n, who sav'd him from his Enemies, By sending him one Careless A Roman Catholick Captatn. for his Guide, On whose Advice and Conduct he rely'd; Till after many Risques and Dangers run, And sundry piercing Hardships undergone, He was, at length, from place to place convey'd, By trusty Loyal Friends, to Brighthemstead A Town in Sussex., Where he embark'd for Normandy in France, And so obtain'd a safe deliverance. Thus are unhappy Princes forc'd to fly The Rage of those who do their Rights enjoy, And shew themselves, whilst they have Pow'r to steer The Helm, worse Tyrants than they seem to fear. Whilst thus the Royal Cause so low was sunk By Cromwel, his Lieutenant-Gen'ral Monk, To awe the Northern Land, was left among The Scots, with Forces Seven-thousand strong, Taking the Towns of Sterling August 14. and Dundee September 3., Storming the latter with much Cruelty; Whither the Scots had taken Care to send Their richest Goods, in hopes they should defend The Town, which they'd well fortify'd, in case The English Rebels should invade the Place; But their Resistance made them fare the worse, For all was plunder'd by the conq'ring Force; Monk pushing forward the successful Scene, Till he possess'd the Town of Aberdeen, And took St. Andrews Presbyterian School, Where the Scotch Guides first learn to play the Fool. At the same time a Knot of Lords were made Pris'ners to th'Rump by Col'nel Alured, With many Highland Gentry, whom he sent To England, to oblige the Parliament, That there remain'd no danger to be fear'd From Scotland, where no rising Storm appear'd. The trouble of the Rump being now alone To manage what they took to be their own: At last upon a Union did agree, In which the Irish and the Scots should be, With England, made Incorporate as one Republick, which was yet but ill begun. To further this their politick Intent, St. Johns and Vane were into Scotland sent, With other Rump Commissioners, to make An offer of their Scheme for Friendship's sake, Warning them all to send from Town and Shire, Their Representatives to Westminster: But this, altho' a Favour, was deny'd, And by their Teachers e'ery where forbid; Altho' they levy'd Sums amidst their Fears, To pay the English Army their Arrears; Which cannot but by all Men be allow'd, To be the greatest Mark of Servitude: For who can boast that they are free from Force, Who are oblig'd to pay their Conquerors; Yet all their Presbyterian Guides declar'd Against the Union by the Rump prepar'd; Because they said, that to the Civil State, It made the things of Christ subordinate. Whence we may see that each Calvinian Priest Sets himself up to be a Pope at least. However, tho' the Scots thus sullen prov'd, The Rump proceeded as it best behov'd Their Wisdoms, and by Act of Parliament, Confirm'd the Union 'thout the Scots Consent, Therein abolishing all Kingly Pow'r In Scotland, as they'd done at Home before; Ordaining heavy Punishments for those That should presume to violate their Laws. They also sent two Agents St. Johns and Strickland. to the Hague, To offer to the Hollanders a League; Who, tho' they'd plaid the like Rebellious Game, Had too much Honour to accept the same, Suff'ring the Croud to gather at their Doors, And treat 'em as Rebellious Murderers. But St. Johns told 'em, when he took his leave, That tho' he found they car'd not to receive The Friendship offer'd till the Scotch Affair Was settl'd, which would soon be brought to bear, Then would they be perplex'd that they'd withstood So fair a League intended for their good. Which words were so prophetick to the Dutch, That they soon after found to their Reproach, The Rump prohibited all Goods but what From Holland were on English Bottoms brought, And were so interupted that they lost Most of their Fish'ry on the English Coast, That their Embassadors were now sent o'er, To ask the Favour they'd refus'd before: Also t'observe how th'People were content With their new Lords and Form of Government; And to inform themselves, by secret Ways, What Naval Forces were in readiness. But now the Rump appear'd so stiff and proud, Their hard Conditions could not be allow'd, Insisting that their Neighbours should agree To pay for Fishing in the British Sea; And that the English should have open Trade, From Middleburgh to Antwerp, as they had Before the Dutch, their Liberty to gain, Revolted from the Monarchy of Spain: Demanding also that amends should be Return'd for their Amboyna Cruelty. Which Terms, so unexpected and severe, Could be attended with no less than War; But the cold Season of the Year, as yet, Would not of Action, till the Spring, admit. Whilst these new Heats in agitation were, Ireland and Scotland were the Rump's chief Care, Which were not yet so totally subdu'd, As to remain in Peace and Quietude. The Persecution of the Loyal Side, Was still carr'd on with Cruelty and Pride: Among the rest, whose Lives they would not spare, One Love, a Presbyterian Minister, Who with the King had Correspondence held, Was sentenc'd to the Axe, and forc'd to yield His Life to their base sanguinary Laws, For proving treach'rous to the Good Old Cause, Rather than for the Service he had done The King, or his affection for the Throne. This Year the Rump did of the Roy'lists gain The fruitful Isles of Soilly and of Man; And to Obedience brought those distant Shores, Barbadoes Island, and St. Christophers. But that which to their Glory added Grief, Cromwel, who was Commander now in Chief, Gave the Rump warning, to agree upon A time when their long sitting should be done; Boldly requiring that the Day should fall In compass of the Bill Triennial: Which made the Traytors now begin to fear Their Reign would scarce survive the foll'wing Year. When Pow'r is on a wrong Foundation built, And Men support their Greatness by their Guilt, The prosp'rous Villain, who by Force can rise, Has always the best Right to Tyrannize. The End of the Third Year. THE CHARACTER OF Duke HAMILTON, Brother of the former. A noble Scot, much honour'd for his Parts, Free from all Flatt'ry and deceitful Arts; Excel'd his Brother greatly, and abhor'd That Cunning practis'd by the former Lord; Yet into Errors had he been misled, Tho' was not in the wrong so rivetted, But he repented and forsook those ways His Judgment told him were unjust and base. And when the Royal Martyr, much too good To Rule a wicked Land, had spilt his Blood, Did firmly to the banish'd Son adhere, As all his future Actions made appear; Assisted in the solemn Pomp at Schone, When the young King receiv'd the Scottish Crown; No penitential Worthy looking back With more abhorrence on each past Mistake, Or could be truly readier to attone For the least Inj'ry he had done the Throne: To Worc'ster City did the King attend, And there, to shew how far he was his Friend, His Fortune in the heat of Battle try'd, Till wounded in the Leg, of which he dy'd A Pris'ner, and escap'd his Brother's Fate, Which, had he liv'd, he must have surely met: Declaring to the Rebels that he found Content amidst the tortures of his wound; And that he thought it hon'rable to lose His Life, by fighting in so just a Cause. Thus the Brave Man, who falls in the defence Of Truth, finds Comfort in his Innocence, Which arms his Breast against the Stings of Death, And sweetens the last Moments of his Breath. THE Earl of Derby's CHARACTER. No Loyal Peer, of all the Noble Train, Could with more Zeal assist his Sovereign, Or in his Royal Master's Suff'rings bear A Larger, or a more Unspotted Share: Nor was he bound by Favours from the Throne, But by true Christian Duty steer'd alone. In Person did in Forty Two attend The King, and, like a brave and gen'rous Friend, Brought Forty-thousand Pounds, Five-thousand Arms To aid him when surrounded with Alarms; Headed Four-thousand Men against the Town Of Manchester, which held against the Crown; Then fortify'd his Seat call'd Latham-House, And left it to his Fair Heroick Spouse, Who kept the same, in Duty to her Liege, Against a thirteen and a twelve Weeks Siege; Whilst her kind Lord did full as Brave appear, In Cheshire, Yorkshire, and in Lancashire; And rally'd in the Fight at Marston-Moor, His Troops three times e'er the Dispute was o'er; From thence escap'd into the Isle of Man, Where he took care to faithfully retain His Loyal Vertues, when the Royal Side Were greatly humbled by Rebellious Pride; Yet he took care to constantly maintain A Correspondence with his Sovereign, By the good Management of that polite Ingenious Worthy Berkenhead the Knight; Succour'd all Roy'lists by Misfortunes thrown Into that Island, where he wore a Crown, That he had always a defensive Force, Made up of trusty Loyal Sufferers: Did sev'ral Vessels of the Rebels seize, Laden with useful rich Commodities; And tho' the Rump had wholly won the Day, Did them what Mischief in his Power lay. When Charles the Good was Martyr'd, and his Son Return'd, in hopes he should obtain his Throne, The watchful Earl soon met him with a Train Of near Two-thousand gallant Gentlemen; The major Part to Worc'ster did attend The King, and with the Royal Army join'd; Whilst he himself remain'd in Lancashire, With sev'ral Troops, to raise the People there; But in the Town of Wigan was surpris'd By Lilbourn, e're the Gentry were advis'd Of the Earl's Presence, that before his Horse Were join'd by any of the Country Force, After a brave Resistance they were Shot, And cut to Pieces on the fatal Spot; The Earl sustaining, as some Authors write, Sev'n Shot upon his Breastplate, in the Fight: His Arms and Shoulders maim'd with wound by wound And thirteen Hacks were on his Beaver found: Two Horses und'r'im shot before he stir'd, Who then escap'd, by mounting of a third, Toth' King at Worc'ster, where the Earl declar'd How ill his Friends in Wigan-Lane had far'd; Which fill'd the Royal Breast with Discontent, And gave the Army great discouragement, Who lay expecting that the Earl would bring, From Lancashire, great Succours to the King, Whereby they might be able to restore Their injur'd Master to the Sov'reign Pow'r; Instead of which, aspiring Noll came down, And drew his Rebel-Host before the Town, Fell on so boldly that he dispossess'd The King, and forc'd the Earl, among the rest, To fly; but he, alas! like many more, Was seiz'd, e're he could make himself secure; Soon after try'd, by a Commission sent To Country Scoundrels from the Parliament, Condemn'd to lose his Head within the Town Of Bolton, which was properly his own; But by revolting from their Loyalty, Had made the Earl so far their Enemy, That by his Provocations they were grown As bitter Foes to him as to the Throne; That Town was therefore chosen, that their Eyes Might feast upon the pleasing Sacrifice, And interupt that quietude of Mind, Which e'ery dying Christian hopes to find. A villainous Barbarity! so great That Turks or Jews would scorn to imitate. Nor were the cruel Rump alone content To crush the Earl, by publick Punishment, But to his Countess Daughter of the Duke de Tremouille, one of the greatest Families iu France. did extend their hate, And brought her to a low penurious State. So impious Rogues, who Blood and Theft pursue, More barb'rous grow by ev'ry Ill they do, Till from all sence of humane Mercy freed, At last to needless Cruelties proceed. THE CHARACTER OF Mr. LOVE. A painful Stretcher of the Holy Word, To propagate Rebellion and the Sword, Ordain'd a Teacher of that restless Clan Of Calvinists, call'd Presbyterian; And as a chosen Oracle was sent To Uxbridge, when the King and Parliament Had order'd their Commissioners to meet, And, free of all Hostility, to treat Of Peace, and try if they could reconcile Those open Discords that inflam'd the Isle: But Love, a Person then but green in Years, Brought thither by the Rump's Commissioners, Assum'd the Pulpit on a Market-day, And in the Church did openly inveigh Against the Peers and Gentlemen imploy'd To there negotiate on the Royal Side, Affirming to the list'ning rural Croud, They came with Hearts from Oxford full of Blood, And that there was, at least, as wide a space Between the present Treaty and a Peace, As between Heav'n and Hell, and that they meant Only t'amuse the People, with intent To gain some great Advantage in their view, Whereby they might, at once, the Land subdue, Most bitterly exclaiming against all The Cavaliers, who bow'd their Knees to Baal; Which ill-tim'd Sermon plainly shew'd, how far Himself and Party were inclin'd to War; And that by treating they design'd no more, Than meerly trifling with the Sov'reign Pow'r, Charging the King with their own stubborn Fau't, That things could to no fruitful End be brought. Just so the noisy disobedient Dame, Whene'er she kindles a domestick flame, Condemns her Nuptial Master for the same. When Fairfax had declin'd the Rebel Host, And crafty Noll succeeded in his Post, Whilst with his active Army he remain'd I'th' North, to terrify the Scottish Land, Suppressing with his utmost Zeal and Care, The Presbyterian Int'rest e'ery where; The Calvinists b'ing angry they had lost The Pow'r the Independants had ingross'd, And finding Cromwel in a prosp'rous way To cheat the Rump of the Imperial Sway, Could not conform their Patience to endure A single Person should possess the Pow'r; Or that another Sectary should bear The Rule, in which they wanted to have share, Were therefore ripe and forward to Rebel Against the Independant Commonweal; Among the rest their preaching Idol, Love, Was zealously industrious to improve All Opportunities that might advance The Int'rest of the Presbyterians, In forwarding Designs to circumvent The Pow'r that call'd themselves the Parliament; Accordingly did divers Letters send To Scotland, to a noted preaching Friend, Concerning some Conspiracy in hand, 'Gainst those invested with the sole Command, Which Cromwel intercepting, sent to Town, Urging a speedy Prosecution; Which was, pursuant to his Orders, made With Rigour, that the Preacher lost his Head, Not on the King's Account, as some agree, But rather for his double Perfidy. For he that first Rebels, and does betray The Prince he's bound in Duty to obey, And then conspires against the trait'rous Pow'r, Is twice the Villain that he was before. A.D. 1652. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Fourth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second. Anno Dom. 1652. The Dutch and English now took equal Care, T'equip their Fleets for the approaching War, Which was not yet proclaim'd, but smoth'ring lay, From their first Quarrel till the midst of May The Fourteenth., About which time some English Frigots met With three Dutch Convoys to a Trading Fleet, Bound homewards from the Streights, and being hal'd By Captain Young, an Englishman, who sail'd As Commodore, he did demand the Dutch To strike their Flag upon his Ships approach; Which their Chief Adm'ral did, without controul; But bearing up to their Vice Admiral, He proudly answer'd, He would not consent To pay the English such a Complement: So that a smart Engagement 'twixt the two, Upon these words, did instantly ensue, Till by their spitfire Instruments of Wrath, Much Blood was spilt, and Mischief done by both; At length the Dutchman, e're 'twas Night, comply'd To strike his Flag, and low'r his stubborn Pride. When Young did of the Admiral demand His Ship or Person for the Wrong sustain'd; Who answer'd, Tho' he'd Struck he'd still secure Himself and Ship toth' utmost of his Pow'r. Young, who was fresh allarm'd with this untow'rd Reply, call'd all his Officers on Board, Who cautiously advis'd him to forbear Engaging, since the Dutch had struck, for fear The War ensuing should be charg'd upon His Rashness, and the Quarrel he'd begun; Therefore Night coming on, they did agree To bear away and leave the Enemy. About a Fortnight after this, Van Trump Near to the Godwin Sands, appear'd in Pomp, With Forty-two stout Sail of Men of War; Whilst Major Bourn, a Naval Officer, I'th' Downs, with sev'ral English Frigots lay, To guard the River and the Towns that way, To whom Van Trump two Captains sent, to make A blind excuse for coming on the back O'th' Godwin. Bourn replying, Tho' he'd sent No other than a civil Compliment, Yet, to confirm it real, without Art, He ought from thence to speedily depart. With which Return the crafty Dutch comply'd, Hoping the Major would be satisfy'd When they had left the Coast, and think they meant No Insult to his Lords the Parliament: But they'd no sooner, as they thought, prevail'd With Bourn to think 'em harmless, but they sail'd Tow'rds Adm'ral Blake, then cruizing on the Seas, To guard the English Coast from Enemies, The Rump b'ing then in Enmity with France, Having just taken seven Ships from thence, As going to the Aid of Dunkirk Town, When close beleaguer'd by the Spanish Crown: But Bourn suspecting what the Dutch design'd, Soon hoisted Sail, and with a prosp'rous Wind, Came within sight of Blake, as Trump had brought His Fleet within the reach of Cannon-shot. No sooner had the Adm'rals look'd upon Each other, but the English fir'd a Gun, A second and a third, for Trump to low'r The flying Ancient that he proudly bore, Which he refus'd, and in return defy'd The English Adm'ral with a fiery side; By that time Bourn came up with Blake, and now The Breach did to a warm Engagement grow; From two a Clock continuing the Fight, Till parted by the darkness of the Night, Wherein the English did the better gain. But tho' they fought so long, yet few were slain, Two Dutchmen chiefly suff'ring in the Fray, One sunk, and t'other born by Blake away. Th'Embassadors from Holland, who, as yet, Resided here, that they might further treat About the League in hand, did now present A Paper to the English Government, Affirming this Encounter 'twixt the Fleets, Was without Will or Knowledge of the States, Desiring nothing might be done thereon, In heat, but wav'd until the Truth was known. The Rump, however, would no time delay, But Voted the States-General should pay The Charges they'd been at, and should repair What Damage they had suffer'd in the War; When these were all made good, that there should be A firm Cessation of Hostility, And mutual Restitution of all Goods And Ships since the beginning of their Feuds; That when these things were done, between the two Republick States a League should then ensue. To this the Embassadors could nothing say, Were therefore soon dispatch'd and sent away. The Quarrel now being openly declar'd, And all things for a vig'rous War prepar'd, Trump into Zealand hasten'd with his Fleet, To make the same more formidably great; Whilst Blake to Orkney Islands made his way, Where Numbers of Dutch Busses fishing lay, And having under his commanding Care, A noble Fleet of Sev'nty Men of War, Took six of their twelve Convoys, Ships of Force, And did the rest, with their small Craft, disperse; Nine hundred Pris'ners into Yarmouth brought, To shew the Herring-catchers now were caught; With many Spoils and Prizes he had won, In this his Northern Expedition; Tho' fail'd of five Dutch Ships from India bound, That were to come by Orkney Islands round; But Chance or Caution did their speed delay, Till th'English Fleet had homewards made their way. In this precarious Juncture of Affairs, When the proud Rump were thus engag'd in Wars, Sir George Ascue the Knight return'd with fifteen Sail Of Ships of War from the Barbadoes Isle, And, by Command, i'th' Downs, at Anchor staid, Till the Thames furnish'd him with further Aid. Van Trump, the while, had so enlarg'd his Fleet, That he commanded sixscore Sail compleat; With which not far from the Land's end he lay, Endeav'ring, for a time, to force his way Twixt Ascue and the River, but the Wind Oppos'd the fatal Work the Van design'd, Till he was call'd to Holland to Convoy Some Merchants Ships who did for safeguard lie. Thence sail'd to Orkney Islands to secure The Ships which Blake had waited for before, Whither, most richly Laden, they were come, And sent from thence, by Trump, in safety home; Who then endeavour'd to engage with Blake, But cross repugnant Winds still kept him back, Till a fierce Storm, at length, dispers'd his Fleet, And forc'd them, in small Bodies to retreat, All gladly getting home what ways they cou'd, To shun the terror of the Winds that blow'd, Whilst lucky Blake, as 'tis express'd before, With his Dutch Captives, reach'd the Yarmouth Shore. In August foll'wing Ascue being sent To Sea, by the Command of Parliament, With forty Sail of Frigots, chanc'd to meet The Sturdy Adm'ral of the Zealand Fleet August 16., In number fifty Men of War, imploy'd T'attend some Merchants Vessels they Convoy'd; But when De Ruyter, who had Chief Command O'th' Dutch, beheld the English Fleet at hand, He sent away his Traders and prepar'd His Ships of Force to stand upon their Guard, Which with Precipitation being done, The English, with their usual warmth, fell on, Both Sides engaging from the Hour of Four In the Afternoon. Till Night came on, and forc'd them to give o'er, De Ruyter making to a Gallick Port, Whose Squadrons had sustain'd the greatest hurt; Whilst for the Port of Plymouth Ascue ply'd, With little less than Victory on his Side, Which, 'twas believ'd, he might have made compleat, Had he engag'd the Foe with all his Fleet; But some being Merchants Ships the Rump had hir'd, Lay by, or lag'd behind, and never fir'd, That tho' his Lords thought proper to reward The Knight for his good Service done on Board, Yet, for some Reasons, they would never more Trust him by Sea with any Naval Pow'r, But voted Dean and Monk, with Blake, should be Their only next Years Admirals by Sea. Van Trump, for some Reproaches, now desir'd To quit his Charge, accordingly retir'd; And one Wit-Witters, of the Holland breed, Did, with De Ruyter, in his Post succeed, Who, in October, with a noble Fleet, Came forth, in hopes to do some wondrous Feat, And by the side of the Northforeland lay, To take what English Shipping pass'd that way; But Blake, who, on the Western Coast had ta'en Five heavy laden Dutch West-India Men, And Six which from the Streights were homewards bound, Computed worth Two-hundred-thousand Pound, No sooner heard the News but steer'd his Course Tow'rds the proud Foe, to battle Force with Force, And so dispos'd his Squadrons under Penn And Bourn His Vice and Rear Admirals. that, with the loss of fewer Men Than perish'd on the other Side, they beat The Dutch October 28., and many Leagues pursu'd their Fleet, Took their Rear-Adm'ral, and to Neptune's Throne Two Ships they sacrific'd, and blow'd up one: Blake with Success continuing his Chase Within twelve Leagues, toth' Eastward of the Maze; From thence, with his two Adm'rals, Penn and Bourn, Did, in great Triumph, to the Downs return, Losing no Ship, the Vict'ry to impair, Such was the Hero's Courage, such his Care. The States concern'd that they the Day had lost, Recall'd Van Trump into his former Post; Who put to Sea forthwith, and spread the Main With Eighty Men of War and Fireships Ten; Which Fleet he to the back o'th' Goodwin brought, Near to the place where the last Fight was fought: Blake lying in the Downs, who when he heard The News, for a fresh Contest now prepar'd, And weighing Anchor with a swelling Gale, Skudded before the Wind with Forty Sail, To battle twice the Number, without fear, There'er the Foe should on the Seas appear; Sending out Seven Ships a head, to Scout, And find their pow'rful Adversaries out, Who meeting Nine Dutch Frigots in their way, On the same Errand, these began the Fray, Till both the daring Admirals came in, And furiously carr'd on the bloody Scene November 29., Fighting by Moonshine from the Hour of Two, Till Daylight did the Odds in Number shew, Bravely maintaining the uncertain Fight, Thro' Sol's Diurnal Course, to Six at Night, When both drew off their Squadrons, but the Dutch, By Strength superior, got the better much, Tho' in the Fray one Flag-Ship of their own, Was, by some Accident, to shatters blown, And all her Compliment but Two, at most, Were in the dreadful Flash of Light'ning lost, Besides an equal Number of their Men, At least, were in the long Engagement slain: But that which gave the Vict'ry to their Side, And puff'd 'em up with Insolence and Pride, Was, that they took Two Frigots, sunk Three more, And, with a Fireship, burnt a Sixth near Shore; Blake up the Thames retiring with his Fleet Much shatter'd, tho' with no Dishonour Beat. However, Trump, to let the English see His Pride, or rather Childish Vanity, Vapour'd 'twixt here and Holland, as 'tis said, With a Broom fix'd upon his Topmast-Head, By which the Pickl'd-Herring seem'd to mean, He'd sweep the Seas of English Shipping clean. But all these Boastings of their great Success, As yet, inclin'd not England to a Peace; The sturdy Rump, tho' vex'd, abating none O'th' Terms they had before insisted on, But Sixscore-thousand Pounds severely laid Upon the People to be Monthly paid, Tow'rds carry'ng on a necessary War Against the Dutch the next succeeding Year. Cromwel still wanting to dissolve the Rump, That he might raise himself to Sov'reign Pomp, Stir'd up the Army to subscribe and send Petitions and Addresses to that End, And other Papers full of gauling words, To ruffle and perplex his Ruling Lords, That they, at length, tho' backward to comply, Yet being aw'd, and fearful to deny, Determin'd by an Act to sit no more After November Treason Fifty-four. But Cromwel not content they should maintain The Rule so long, resolv'd to dock their Reign, Well knowing that himself could never tow'r, Whilst such a croud of Kings usurp'd the Pow'r. The Rump b'ing much concern'd at the Reproach Put on the English Navy by the Dutch, Resolv'd to Man out, for the time to come, An able Fleet, to make 'em low'r their Broom; Accordingly Blake, Dean, and Monk were sent, With Eighty Sail, not doubting but th'Event Would prove so prosp'rous to the English Side, As to make Trump repent his foolish Pride. Big with these Hopes the sturdy Gen'rals Call'd so by the Parliament. weigh'd Their Anchors February 8., and in Pomp their Flags display'd, And from the Town of Queenbrough steer'd their course Tow'rds Portsmouth, where they join'd their Naval Force And, in a Body, sail'd from thence to meet Imperious Trump with his Victorious Fleet, Which, to the South of Portland, they espy'd, With a large Fleet of Merchants 300 Sall. he Convoy'd, All Laden homewards bound, beneath the Care (As their Prints own'd) of Seventy Men of War, Which Adm'ral Trump collected, upon sight Of th'English Squadrons, and prepar'd to Fight February 18.; At t'Hour of Eight i'th' Morning they begun Their Battle, and with equal Rage fell on, Fought for three Days, whilst they had Wind and Light, And only ceas'd when Calm, or in the Night; Till Blake, by downright Brav'ry, in the End, A gallant Vict'ry o'er the Foe obtain'd, Taking and sinking, e're the Dutch gave o'er, One Flagship, and Ten other Men of War, Took also Thirty Merchant Ships beside, And Fifteen-hundred of their Men destroy'd; Losing no more, in all the hot Dispute, Than one small Frigot The Sampson., whose Commander fought Till She sunk und'r'im, but some Boats that gave Assistance, did himself and Seamen save. Thus all the Vanity which Trump had shown For one poor Vict'ry scandalously won By Odds in Number, was return'd, at length, Upon the boasting Van by equal Strength; Who, with Dishonour, sneak'd well beaten home, Much laugh'd at for his Hieroglyphick Broom. 'Tis dang'rous to insult a worsted Foe, Whilst he has Pow'r to stand a second Blow; For Insolence to Courage adds such spight, That makes the Brave with double Fury fight. The End of the Fourth Year. THE CHARACTER OF THE Earl of Norwich, Father of the Lord Goring. His youthful Days the Loyal Worthy spent In sprightly Pastimes, Wine and Merriment, Until Wisdom, Age, and Gravity came on, And then he left those Pleasures to his Son. Was favour'd by his Prince, as fit to trust, And in the worst of Times prov'd Firm and Just: Was, in the King's declension of his Pow'r, To France sent over his Ambassador; Where he remain'd till Royal Goodness fell Into their Hands, too Vile to use him well; And then return'd to England, by Consent Of those Imperious Lords the Parliament; The Earl pretending to compound for all His Loyal Vertues with that black Cabal, A Favour which they granted unto some Who'd done 'em no great Mischief here at home: But finding, after he some Months had spent In England, that the Royalists in Kent Were up in Arms, and having Int'rest there To head their Troops, did privately repair To Maidstone, where he found an able Force, Well Arm'd, consisting both of Foot and Horse; But being in Affairs of War unskill'd, For want of due Experience in the Field, Left half his Host at Maidstone to be beat By Fairfax with an Army twice as great; Whilst, with the rest of his divided Pow'r, Himself unactive lay at Rochester; When if his Forces had united been, He might have turn'd the Tide and chang'd the Scene; For had he fought one Battle with Success, 'Twas the Rump's Fear, and e'ery Body's Guess, That London would have left the Rebel Herd, And gladly for the Royal Cause declar'd; But the wrong Measures of the Earl, at length, Oblig'd him, with some Remnants of his Strength, To cross the Thames to Essex, where he join'd Brave Lisle and Lucas, cordially inclin'd To serve the King, and to that End had rais'd Their Friends, who equal Loyalty profess'd: But knowing Fairfax, from the Kentish Shore, With Force superior soon would Ferry o'er, The Royal Troops, to be the more secure, Retir'd into the Town of Colchester, Where being close Besieg'd, they were compel'd, After a long and brave Defence, to yield: From whence the Earl was to the Tow'r convey'd, Try'd by th'High-Court, and doom'd to lose his Head; But sav'd his Life by a Petition sent Toth' Rump, which mollify'd the Parliament, So far, that in his Lordship's doubtful Case, The House prov'd equal in their Yeas and Na's, That the deciding Vote for Life or Death, Remain'd intirely in the Speaker's Breath, Who to some former Service had regard, And for the Earl, in Gratitude, declar'd: By which kind Providence he liv'd to see The End of vile Rebellious Tyranny, And with glad Eyes beheld the vacant Throne Replenish'd justly by the Royal Son. So when the God of Day withdraws his Light, And loud Tempestuous Winds break loose by Night, Some Noble Cedars stand securely fast, Whilst neighb'ring Thousands perish by the Blast. THE Earl of Lautherdale's CHARACTER His Parts and his Industry both were great, And well adapted to Intrigues of State: None with more Cunning could contrive a bad Design, or foll'w it closer when 'twas laid. In Flatt'ry he excel'd the Northern Race, And to his Foes could shew a friendly Face; To gain his Point would act a treach'rous Part, And hide, with Smiles, the Malice of his Heart: But, where he'd Power, was by Nature bent To be Imperious, Stern, and Insolent; Tho' in the wrong, too Stubborn to be won From his own Judgment or Opinion: Which Temper he preserv'd intirely free From Honour, Justice, and from Loyalty, That, void of all Restriction, he rely'd On Prejudice and Passion for his Guide, Which he alone consulted, and pursu'd Their Dictates, foreign to his Country's good; Tho' not a Scot could better understand The dark Designs both Kingdoms had in hand, Whilst they united to oppose the Crown, That they might pull the Church and Monarch down; For early he rebell'd, when scarce of Age, And was of those that did at first engage Against the King, and unrepenting run Thro' all the Series of Rebellion; Would not forsake what once he had embrac'd, But in the wrong continu'd to the last. So the Fair Damsel, when she's leap'd the Fence Of Vertue, and abus'd her Innocence, Knowing her Honour is eclips'd thereby, Pursues the Folly 'twas her Fate to try. A.D. 1653. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Fifth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1653. Nol wanting now but one Gradation more, From his High Station to the Sov'reign Pow'r, Which was to set his Foot upon the Necks O'th' Rump, who only could his Scheme perplex; Therefore resolv'd to speedily exert His Martial Pow'r, and act the Tyrant's Part, And to effect by Violence what he thought, By gentle Means, could not so well be wrought; Accordingly to his Assistance calls Two of his trusty Major-Generals, Lambert and Harrison, with many more Great Officers, to countenance his Pow'r; Also a Guard sufficient to correct Ill Manners, Stubborness, or Disrespect: And thus attended in surprising Pomp, He march'd to pay a Visit to the Rump April 23., To whom he spoke some few imperious words, And, in the end, dissolv'd his Sov'reign Lords, Lock'd up the House, and left a rugged Guard Behind, their further Meeting to retard; Which daring Act the Publick did commend, Above the greatest Vict'ries he had gain'd; Whilst the Rump Members, who, before their Fall, Had the whole Sway, became the Scorn of all. Thus when the Greater Tyrant awes the Less, One wins Applause, the other meets Disgrace; For all Men slight Usurpers when they've lost The Ruling Pow'r they wrongfully ingross'd. The Dutch b'ing now prepar'd again to try If they could ballance their lost Victory, Dispatch'd to Sea a Hundred and Four Men Of War, Twelve Sail of Galliots, Fire-Ships Ten, With Trump, De Ruyter, Wittens, and two more The Eversons., Who shar'd among them the Commanding Pow'r. Monk, join'd with Dean, were order'd out to meet The Dutch with not a much inferior Fleet Penn Vice, Lawson Rear-Admiral., Wh'attack'd the Foe the second Day of June, Betwixt Eleven and Twelve a Clock at Noon, Both Sides performing on the watry Stage Their Parts, with envious and obdurate Rage, Till a stark Calm their Fury did abate, And gave a cooling respite to their Heat: But after two unactive Hours a Gale Sprung up afresh, and to't again they fell, Darting their merc'less Thunderbolts till Night Delay'd, but did not end their bloody Fight; For next Day Noon Monk made a new Attack, And fought till Ninety of the Dutch gave back, Twenty of which return'd at Trump's Command, But Sev'nty would the Brunt no longer stand; That in the end the English won the Day, And sent the Dutch, once more, well bang'd away, Sunk Six of their best Ships, Two more they lost In heat of Battle by a Powder blast; Brought in Ten Hoys, Eleven Ships of Force, And almost Fourteen-hundred Prisoners; Three of the batter'd number they had ta'en, Proving large Flag-Ships, well supply'd with Men; Losing but one small Frigot in the Fight, From which the Dutch withdrew near Ten at Night, Dean, Monk's Assistant-Gen'ral, being cut In two i'th' middle by a fatal Shot, As by his Valiant Partner's Side he stood Upon the slipp'ry Deck that flow'd with Blood, This Vict'ry to the English prov'd so great, That the Dutch sent Embassadors to treat, Tho' the fierce War did not determine here, As will hereafter in its place appear. Now all that Cromwel wanted was to gain A House of Commons that would fix his Reign, Knowing 'twas best and safest to receive A Right from them which none had Right to give, Yet thought their Sanction the securest way To make the Croud more passively obey: But e're his Highness could this Work compleat, He call'd a Council, which he stil'd, of State, Made up of his own Creatures, and to them Did seemingly resign the Pow'r supreme, Only till he could form a friendly House Of Commons, fit for his ambitious use; Which he accomplish'd soon, with no small Art, According to the Wishes of his Heart; And from the Council did to them transfer The Pow'r to his new Friends, with special Care That when he'd made his chosen Tribe supreme, They might, in Form, resign the same to him; Yet, for Security, thought fit to call A new Commanding Council or Cabal, Consisting of his greatest Officers, Who Audience gave to all Embassadors, Made Ordinances, binding Laws and Rules, As if they meant the Commons but their Tools, Who on the fourth of July fill'd the House, And, for their Speaker, chose one Francis Rouse A Cornish Member.; Calling their wild Convention by the Name Of England's Parliament, to England's Shame; For thus establish'd they began to make New Statutes, so ridiculously weak, As if 'twas Cromwel's principal Intent, By chusing Men to so much Folly bent, To bring a publick Odium and Disgrace On Parliaments, that he again might raise The Monarchy, at which His Highness aim'd, To some Repute, which had so long been blam'd. One Act they fram'd, that future Marriages Should all be made by Justices o'th' Peace, Declaring such to be of no effect, Perform'd not as that Statute did direct; Yet none by this new Law forbidden were To Marry by a Priest or Minister; Which caus'd all Loving Pairs, who fear'd this last New Tye scarce strong enough to bind 'em fast, To Marry both ways, that the Bonds of Love Might, by a double Knot, the stronger prove. They also took off the Engagement laid By the preceeding Parliament, which made All Persons that refus'd to stoop thereto, Incapable in any Court to Sue. They also very wisely undertook To Cancel all the Laws, and ev'ry Book Thereto belonging, and to frame a Code More short and easy for the Publick Good, Such as might better suit that impious Herd Of Fools who for Fifth Monarchy declar'd, Of which Fanatick Tribe, profoundly dull, This Bedlam of a Parliament were full: They likewise fram'd a Bill, in their defence, Henceforward to perpetuate Parliaments, That Phœnix-like, to still preserve the Breed, One should beget another to succeed, By issuing out their Writs upon the Day Themselves resign'd their arbitrary Sway; But e're they brought these two last Acts to bear, They crush'd themselves, like Blockheads as they were. For they began, in their Debates, to be So full of Notion, Grace, and Mystery, That had they sate much longer in the House, They would have made all Pow'r ridiculous, Arraigning, as an Antichristian Vice, The Maintenance of Ministers by Tythes, And rais'd up such Disputes that made 'em fall Beneath the Scorn and Ridicule of all; That Rouse the Speaker, Cromwel's Cordial Friend, And others in the self-same Int'rest join'd, After the Council had the Feud begun, And warmly press'd their Dissolution, Stood up and told the rest, 'Twas neither fit Nor needful they a longer time should sit. The Speaker then withdrawing from his Chair, Follow'd by all who of his Faction were, Went with his Mace before him to Whitehall; And there deliver'd back to Pious Nol, The Instrument which he before to them Had giv'n, when first into the House they came, Whilst Harrison, who had before laid down His Major-Generals Commission, Staid with those wild Enthusions, who maintain, King Jesus only hath the Pow'r to Reign As Monarch o'er the Saints, and they alone The Right to Govern all beneath his Throne: A Faith that makes 'em near to Heav'n ally'd, And bends their Reason to their Holy Pride; But these too stubborn to attend on Rouse, Were soon Dissolv'd December 12., and forc'd to quit the House, By a strong Guard of Soldiers, who were sent To scowre the Righteous Dregs of Parliament. Thus first the Rump extorted from the Throne The Pow'r Supreme, by their Rebellion, Cromwel, by Violence, dispossesses them, And to another Senate gives the same, That from their Hands he might again receive, What neither he nor they had Right to give. So Boys at Cricket bang the Ball about, Till he that's most expert bowls t'other out. Cromwel in four Days after December 16. he had plaid This Trick with those new Lords himself had made, By th'Council having been desir'd to take The Rule upon him for his Country's sake, Humbly submitted to that painful Trust, And took an Oath to Govern and be Just, According to a Scrowl that did contain Some certain Rules by which he was to Reign; The same being read before he was Install'd, Which Obligation by the Saints was call'd, The Instrument, to make themselves secure From Monarchy and Arbitrary Pow'r. Just so the Godly, who for Conscience sake Dissent, in Times of Persecution take Those Oaths and Sacraments they mean to break. His Highness chiefly was enjoin'd the Care Of Calling Senate's e'ery Tertian Year, The first of which should in September meet, And on the third thereof begin to sit; That no new Parliament should be dismiss'd Until the same had sate Five Months at least; Also what Bills the Commons then should lay Before him, should within the Twenti'th Day Receive His Highness's Assent, if not, The same should Pass, and be in Force without: That he should call a Council to consist Of Twenty-one at most, Thirteen at least, Who after the Protector's Death should meet, And chuse another for that Station fit; With sev'ral more Conditions, but of all The Compact these were most material. Thus was he rais'd from fighting for his Bread, To Rule those Fools by whom he first was made. So Thieves, when they have rob'd, take always care To give the boldest Rogue the biggest Share. During these Managements the Dutch, tho' full Of Spleen, had underhand apply'd to Nol, And made some Overtures of Peace, but yet Were so disgusted with their last Defeat, That they resolv'd to make one Tryal more At Sea, their late lost Credit to restore; Accordingly they fitted out a Fleet, In strength a Hundred-twenty-five compleat, That Trump once more his Fortitude might show, And boldly venture a deciding Blow The Admirals under Trump were, Everson, Floris, and Wise Wittens.. Blake was so Indispos'd he could not head The Fleet that Monk commanded in his stead, With Penn and Lawson for his Vice and Rear, Who with a Hundred and Six Men of War Put out to Sea, in order to defy The Pow'r of the superior Enemy: At length the English, early in the Morn July 29. Espy'd the Dutch, but were so far a Stern, That 'twas some Hours before the Fleets were got Within the fatal reach of Cannon-shot: Soon after Six the English came so near, That their Light-Ships had signal giv'n to Fire, Till their proud Chiefs came up to carry on The bloody Scene, with equal Heat begun: Monk, who resolv'd to fight the Battle hard, And that no Blood should be by Mercy spar'd, Gave Orders, that no Captain in the Fleet Should Quarter give, or to the same submit, But haul in close, Example take by him, And fight it to a period, sink or swim. This made the Battle terribly severe, And both Sides struggle without Hope or Fear, That shatter'd Limbs and Splinters flew about, And wreaking Gore at Scupper-holes run out, Till the sad Seas in which the Fleets were spread, Their verdent Colour chang'd from Green to Red; And all that Air wherein their Thunder broke, Was, by their Cannon, turn'd to Fire and Smoke; Both Sides contending with unweary'd Heat, As if both equally resolv'd to get The Vict'ry, or to drown in Blood and Sweat. However, after two Days dreadful Fight, (The Battle only ceasing in the Night, Trump by a Musket-Bullet being slain, A Flag-Ship sunk, and their Rear-Adm'ral Everson. ta'en) The Dutch despairing did their Canvas spread, And fairly beaten to the Texel fled, Returning less by Three and Thirty Sail, All which a Sacrifice to Neptune fell, The English saving from the gaping Waves, Twelve-hundred Souls, the rest had watry Graves; The Victors only losing in the Fray One Ship, which to the Bottom made her way, Eight Captains and Four-hundred Common-Men, B'ing all that on the English Side were slain. Thus wealthy Nations quarrel to procure That Peace and Friendship they enjoy'd before, Only the Lucky Side that wins the Day, Makes t'other all their fighting Charges pay. The End of the Fifth Year. THE CHARACTER OF Major-General Harrison. Born at Nantwich, a Cheshire Butcher's Son, Nurs'd up in Blood and Cruelty, till grown A sturdy Lad, then plac'd beneath the Care, For some few Years, of an Attorney there: But when Domestick Jars and Wars began, Laid down the Pen and from his Master ran, To lend a Shoulder to the Good-Old-Cause, Against his King, Religion and the Laws; Till, by his daring Courage, he became, Thro' all the Roundhead-Host, a Man of Fame; Was first a Cornet, then a Captain made; And when the Army was new Modell'd, play'd His Cards with Nol so cunningly and well, That he advanc'd him to be Colonel Of Horse, which Post he had obtain'd before The Injur'd King fell into Cromwel's Pow'r; Who finding Harrison a stern compleat Fanatick Rebel, for his Purpose fit, Made him, in nice Affairs, his Bosom-Friend, And on his Conduct greatly did depend; Trusted the Royal Pris'ner in his Care, Who, in respect to Majesty, rid bare; Yet tho' without his Hat he thus convey'd The King, none wish'd him more without his Head, Lodging him safe in Windsor, where he lay Till the vile Rump prepar'd the bloody way, By which they were resolv'd to take him off, And make the Name of King a publick Scoff. The Colonel, for his faithful Service done, In e'ery Branch of the Rebellion, Having soon after, from the Rump, a Call, To the High-Post of Major-General: Which he laid down in dudgeon, when he found That crafty Cromwel had himself enthron'd: Headed that wild Enthusiastick Herd, Who for King Jesus frantickly declar'd, And vex'd his old Imperious Friend so far, As to confine the Major Prisoner; Who, after all the Battles he had fought, And wicked Wonders for Confusion wrought, Tho' he had help'd to slay his Sov'reign Lord, The Butcher liv'd to see the Son restor'd, And to be made, by Just and Righteous Laws, A Tyburn Martyr for the Good-Old-Cause. Justice, tho' crush'd a while by impious Throngs, Still rears her flaming Sword to punish Wrongs; As the fierce Bull returns upon his Foes, And Gores the Dogs that pin'd him by the Nose. THE CHARACTER OF Mr. John Lilburn. At first a poor Bookbinder by his Trade, Nurs'd up in Treason, which he daily spread, Till famous grown for scatt'ring thro' the Town, malicious Flirts and Libels 'gainst the Crown; At length by the Star-Chamber-Court was Fin'd And punish'd, which enrag'd his Factious Mind So far, that he was not content alone To vend what others wrote against the Throne, But as he'd been well read in all the Lies And Factious Shams that Malice could devise, Was, by their Venom now inspir'd to write, And turn'd rebellious Author out of Spite, Temper'd much Virulence with little Sence, And pleas'd the Party with his Impudence; That by the Saints he was believ'd Inspir'd To do or say whate'er the Cause requir'd. When Civil Wars broke out, the Champion then, For the Broad-Sword, let fall the Rebel's Pen; By Nature was for any Mischief fit, And fearless fought, as fiercely as he writ: At Brentford Fight was taken, close confin'd, And for exemplar Punishment design'd, But by connivance of the Marshal made Escape, and to the Rebel-Army fled, Who was receiv'd as one who had defy'd The threaten'd Vengeance of the Royal Side. Cromwel, to whose Advantage he had sown, By his vile Pamphlets, much Sedition, The useful Tool familiarly caress'd, And wondrous Friendship to the Knave profess'd; But tho' he was an Officer of Note, Desir'd his stay in London, where he thought His Notions in Religion, which were bent Against the Presbyterian Government, Might, if improv'd by Scribling, serve the Ends Of climbing Cromwel and his Army Friends, And therefore wanted Lilburn's busy Crown, To broach and cultivate his Whims in Town; Who, as Old Nol expected, could not rest, But soon let fly the Scruples of his Breast, Against the Rump, till he, at length, was sent To Prison by the angry Parliament, Who were, by Cromwel's Letter to the House, So aw'd, that they were forc'd to let him loose; Yet he continu'd daily to arraign The Rump's Proceedings with a daring Pen. But Nol no sooner had dissolv'd his Lords, And bully'd them with proud imperious Words, Usurp'd the Pow'r, and made himself the great Goliah of the sick distracted State, But restless Lilburn thought him worthy then Of being made the subject of his Spleen, And now he had ingross'd the Sov'reign Pow'r, Prov'd more his En'my than his Friend before, Exposing all his Crimes in such a Style As render'd him so infamously vile, That Nol foresaw, unless he took him off The Stage, he ne'er shou'd easy be or safe; Therefore to stop his Insolence took care To have him seiz'd, and brought him to the Bar, Charg'd him with Treason, but the Culprit made So smart and strenuous a Defence that sway'd The Jury, and prevail'd with them to strain A Point to save him, tho' the Proof was plain. Thus Lilburn over Cromwel got the Day, In spite of all the Bench could do or say; Which the Protector thought a worse Defeat Than in the Field of Mars he ever met, Tho' he took care to keep him close in Jayl, Till he himself from all his Greatness fell. Thus the aspiring Villain gains his Ends, By busy restless Tools and daring Friends: But when they've rais'd the Tyrant to a Throne, It is his Safety then to tread 'em down. A.D. 1654. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Sixth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second. Anno Dom. 1654. Monk having humbl'd Holland's stubborn Pride, Who on their Naval Strength too much rely'd, They now were forc'd to condescend so far, As to to pay England's Charges of the War, And glad, when they in vain had try'd their Arms, To purchase Peace upon the Victor's Terms. The Articles whereof were forthwith Sign'd April the 5th., And both the Foes in mutual Friendship join'd, Which the two Nations did alike proclaim With Joy, in London and in Amsterdam April the 16th., Much to the Comfort of those Trading Towns, Where Peace with Wealth th'industrious Merchant crowns. From Madrid an Embassador was sent, To welcome Nol to his new Government: Another from the Portugueze came o'er, To humbly sue for Peace and own his Pow'r. France, as a Colleague, sent a Minister The Baron of Baas. To their old Agent then residing here, And caus'd his two Embassadors, to own The Rebel's Right who had usurp'd the Throne: Nor was he of his State a little proud, When thus his Neighbours to his Greatness bow'd, And paid him all those Honours, to their Shame, That one Crown'd Head could from another claim. Hence he concluded that no sudden Blow, From Foreign Parts, could work his Overthrow; At Home foresaw no Danger worth his Fears, But some Commotion of the Cavaliers; To prevent which the crafty Tyrant made A Plot, which was with so much Cunning laid, That Six were drawn into the fatal Snare, Two of which number executed were Colonel John Gerard, Beheaded, and Peter Vowel Hang'd in July., A third condemn'd for the same Crime was thought Worthy of Mercy, 'cause he own'd the Plot Somerset Fox., And gave thereby some Credit to the Grand Design the Loyal Party had in hand; Tho' most believ'd 'twas but a Trick of Nol's, To awe his Foes and please obeying Fools. Rebels who, by ill Arts, to Empire rise, Must be beholding to Conspiracies; For Plots of State well laid and roundly prov'd, Make them at once both dreaded and belov'd. On the same Day that Gerard lost his Head, The same keen Axe struck Pantalion Brother to the Portugueze Ambassador. dead, Who in a Riot on th'Exchange had slain One Greenway, an offenceless Gentleman; A Pardon for which Murder was deny'd By Nol, when many for the same apply'd; Tho' he himself had waded thro' a Flood Of Royal, Innocent, and Loyal Blood, Yet was too Just to stain his Ill-got Pow'r, By rescuing a barb'rous Murderer. So Masters oft will punish in their Men, Those very Vices which themselves retain; And the Licentious Justice be severe With him that Swears, perhaps, but once a Year. The Exil'd King did hitherto remain In France to mediate Peace 'twixt them and Spain, Hoping, if that good Office could be done, They would assist him to regain his Throne; But Mazarine thought proper to withstand The Treaty, and delay'd the Work in hand, Which gave the King much Trouble, that he left The Gallick Court, resolving now to shift Among the German Princes, till he gain'd Some kind compassionate and pow'rful Friend, That would enabl'im to return and fight The Rebel who withheld his lawful Right. The King, pursuant to his purpose, made His Progress to Chatillon A House of the Prince of Conde., where he staid Some Days till he and Rupert had agreed Upon the Place to which they should proceed, And being both upon the Spaw intent, Thither the banish'd Friends in private went; Where, from the Hague, the Beauteous Princely Dame Of Orange to her Royal Brother came, And, after she some Months had kindly mourn'd Her Brother's Sufferings, to her Court return'd: The King attending to the famous Town Of Cologne, where such high Respect was shown To both the Princes, that the Guns were fir'd, The Burghers in their pompous Robes attir'd, And such a Welcome giv'n that scarce before Was ever made for King or Emperor; As if that Kind and Gen'rous City meant To comfort up the Wrong'd and Innocent. From thence they mov'd to Bedinguen, and there The Royal Brother left the Princely Fair, To varnish Beauty with a parting Tear. The Duke of York did still in France remain Lieutenant-Gen'ral under Great Turenne, Continuing that Station for a time, After the French were guilty of the Crime Of making Peace with the Usurper here, Less out of Interest than shameful Fear. But Princes, when they're aw'd, like private Men, Will Honour oft for present Safety stain, Shake Hands with Rebels, who have Kings o'erthrown, Forgetting the same Fate may prove their own. Cromwel's old Army, having now prevail'd In Ireland, and the Native Irish quell'd, Made their own Markets of their Foes they'd beat And took Submissions as themselves thought fit; To Spain, as 'twas agreed, transported some, Who chose to wander from their Native Home, Much rather than to live beneath the Force And Insults of their cruel Conquerors; A new High-Court of Justice also rais'd, Where they Condemn'd and Butcher'd whom they pleas'd; Tho' 'tis confess'd they did but justly deal By one Sir Phelim, Knight, surnam'd Oneal, A bold Hibernian, who had first begun Against the King the Scotch Rebellion, Him the Court sentenc'd to a Traytor's Fate, Wh' accordingly was punish'd near the Gate Of the Lord Canfield's House, where he had been A cruel Actor in a bloody Scene, And caus'd the worthy Father of that Peer To fall a Victim to his Murderer. Who then in Pow'r would be severe with those That stoop beneath their Mercy, tho' they're Foes, Since sudden Chance so often turns the Tide, And gives the Barb'rous up to be destroy'd By those they once made Vassals to their Pride. Ireland b'ing now from Insurrections free, And Harry Cromwel. made his Father's Deputy, To keep back Lambert from that distant Post, Whom Nol was jealous of and fear'd to trust; No more Alarms could give Disturbance there, Where all things look'd so promising and fair: But as Usurpers Reigns are seldom free From Storms that ruffle their Tranquility, No sooner were the Irish Thorns cut down, But Scotland was with Brambles over-run; For many of the Lords and Gentry there, Had rais'd new Force and stood prepar'd for War; But Morgan Colonel. meeting with their Highland Host, Consisting of Four-thousand Scots at most, And those ill Arm'd, attack'd 'em with Success, At Cromar, drove 'em into great Distress, And in the sharp Dispute was very near Taking their Gen'ral, Glencarn, Prisoner: However, tho' the Highland Army fled Dispers'd, they were not so dispirited, But they resum'd the Courage to rejoin, And would not for one Blow the Field decline, Waiting some time till Middleton came o'er With promis'd Aid from the Batavian Shore; But when he did his Foreign Forces Land, Himself commission'd to have Chief Command; Glencarn, who thought he'd Title to that Post, Withdrew, and with him numbers of his Host; So that the Succours which the King had sent, Instead of adding Strength, rais'd Discontent, And made the Scots more weak and disinclin'd, To cordially espouse the Troops they'd join'd. In these Disorders Monk by Nol was chose Chief Gen'ral to chastise his Northern Foes, Who coming with an able Army down Upon the Scots new Gen'ral Middleton, Gave Him, Monroe and Loughb'ry such a Blow July the 20th. That prov'd at once their total Overthrow, And cow'd 'em so that Scotland soon appear'd Too tame and calm, like Ireland, to be fear'd; For now their Kirk her mighty Empire lost, And could no more Divine Assemblies boast, Tho' Cromwel was prevail'd with, by degrees, T'allow their keeping up Presbyteries; But so restrain'd from what they were before, That they lost much of their Religious Pow'r, Were all so aw'd by Morgan's English Troops, And Cottrel's, that the Kirk had little hopes To effect any thing that could degrade The Tyrant whom their Villanies had made; That Cromwel now had little else to do, Than on his Six new Flanders Mares to shew His Art of Government; but spight of all His Care they gave the Rebel such a Fall From the high Coach-Box he had made his Throne, That he had like to've far'd like Phaeton: From whence the English Slaves, who did obey The Tyrant, had sufficient Cause to say, That Foreign Brutes were wiser far than they. According to the Instrument or Scroll Of Government which the Protector Nol Had Sign'd and Swore to, when the Saints of late Install'd him in his wooden Chair of State, A Parliament conven'd September the 3d., whose Members knew How Cromwel had out-trick'd the former two, Therefore the major Part resolv'd to make The tott'ring Fabrick of his Greatness shake, Or let, at least, the Rebel-Upstart see They were not aw'd by his Authority; Accordingly enquir'd, who call'd 'em there? What Lawful Pow'r had made 'em what they were? But Cromwel, full as Resolute as they, Soon flung a stumbling Edict in their way, Whereby such Members as would not consent T'a Recognition of his Government, Were stil'd Malignants, and debar'd the House, As Persons whose Designs were dangerous; Which Oath such Numbers of the Godly scar'd, That of Four-hundred who at first appear'd, Scarce half comply'd at present, tho' at length Some tender Consciences acquir'd such strength, That many more submitted, till the whole Made up about Three-hundred by the Poll; Yet this acknowledgment, by Oath enjoin'd, Had not so tam'd the Saints to Cromwel's Mind, But they had Courage to proceed upon Each Article o'th' Recognition; And made such Work, that they'd no sooner spent Their Five Months limited by th'Instrument, But Nol was in his Speech so bold and free To charge a part of 'em with Treachery, And then, to shew his Enemies how much He valu'd them, dissolv'd 'em with Reproach. No sooner was this Parliament dismiss'd Two Days after., But Major Wildman by the State was seiz'd, For spreading Declarations to prepare The People for a new Domestick War, Proving 'twas lawful to subdue the Pride Of Cromwel, and Necessitous beside. A second Plot was also charg'd upon The poor Malignants, such as lov'd the Crown, And two of their Chief Leaders Sir John Packington and Sir Henry Littleton. haul'd before The Council, and committed to the Tow'r: Nor was this New Design without some Ground; For all the Loyal Peers and Gentry round The Kingdom jointly had agreed to rise, And bid Defiance to their Enemies, Having the King's Commission to proceed In this Affair, and warrant what they did; But Manning, a deceitful fawning Spark, Made, for his Loyal Father's Colonel Manning. sake, a Clerk To the King's Secretary, had betray'd The whole Design to Thurloe Oliver's Secretary, with whom he held a Correspondence., how 'twas laid, The time appointed to begin the Scene, And who in England were to Act therein, That what Attempts they made were all in vain, And only serv'd t'establish Cromwel's Reign; For tho' in sundry Counties some appear'd In Arms, yet many Gentry were deter'd, Because they knew the Project must be blown, By seizing Packington and Littleton: Nor did the Royal Party meet Success, Or make one prosp'rous Step in any place, Cromwel had taken such industrious Care To crush 'em or disperse 'em e'ery where. Loyal Sir Thomas Harris being brought From Shrewsbury Pris'ner, taken in the Plot. Nor did that Villain Manning, who betray'd The Secret for the sake of being paid, Escape an Execution justly due, For Treach'ry to his Prince and Country too: Nor was he only false in this alone, But had contracted for a Pension, To Weekly give Intelligence of all The King's Affairs to Cromwel at Whitehall; But was, at length, surpris'd by Col'nel Tuke, Who, for some Reasons of Suspicion, broke His Chamber-Door, and found the Youth intent Upon an Answer to a Pacquet sent From Thurloe; for which treasonable Act, Having no room t'extenuate the Fact, He was Condemn'd, to Execution brought, And, at the Court's Request, unpity'd Shot At one of the Duke of Newburgh's Castles.. Who but a Judas would betray his Trust, And to the Prince that feeds him be Unjust, Since e'ery Man must know that Heaven sees His Treach'ry through his best Obscurities; And, if not here, hereafter will repay His daring Treasons in a dreadful way. The End of the Sixth Year, concluding with the Death of that Learned Antiquary Mr. Selden. OLIVER CROMWEL's CHARACTER. Descended, as some Writers do agree, By Father's Side, of a Welch Family, Williams by Name Of Glamorganshire., who in the Times of Yore, When the Eighth Henry held the Sov'reign Pow'r, Marry'd the Only Daughter of that fam'd And trusty Cromwel, to the Block condemn'd, Who being kind and gen'rous e're he dy'd, To him who'd made the darling Fair his Bride, The grateful Son-in-law, to please his Dame, Declin'd his own, and took her Maiden Name; From whose Embrace, in after Ages, sprung That Tyrant who reveng'd her Father's Wrong, And rent that Throne asunder which had been The bane of divers Lords and many a Queen: Nor could the sinful'st Nation e'er produce A Man so Wicked, yet so prosperous; As if all Powers join'd t'inspire his Heart, And Heav'n and Hell at once both took his Part; For ne'er was found, since Adam's Reign began, So strange a Mixture in one daring Man, Bold as a Lyon, pious as a Saint, Would still Rebel, yet seemingly repent; And seldom drew his base unlawful Sword To smite the Church, before he sought the Lord: Was excellent at Preaching and at Pray'r, Yet by the Living God as oft would Swear, Bog'd at no Wickedness to serve his Pride, But both the Laws of God and Man defy'd; And to reform Religion by the Edge O'th' Sword, encourag'd Murder, Sacrilege, And all the Ills that the Infernal Race Could Broach in the Disguise of Faith and Grace; Yet when by all the vile deceitful Means, Blood, Treach'ry, and the worst of Tragick Scenes He'd gain'd his Ends, he manag'd with such Art, That none could better Act a Tyrant's Part: Made all the Nations round him dread his Sword, And tremble when he spoke a threat'ning Word; So greatly aw'd 'em that they own'd his Pow'r, Each sending over their Embassador; Some to beg Peace on such submissive Terms, As shew'd the distant Terror of his Arms; Others to court his Friendship and his Aid, That by his Smiles they might be safer made. Thus Europe, tho' she frowningly abhor'd His Actions, shiver'd when he touch'd his Sword, And looking back on Wonders he had done, Grew chill with fear she should be quite o'errun. Which shews that when the Martyr kiss'd the Block, The neighb'ring Monarchs felt the dreadful Shock. At home, tho' look'd on with an envious Eye, By even those who'd rais'd him up so high, And so surrounded by invet'rate Foes, That to their own Destruction oft arose; Yet, by his Craft he baffl'd their Designs, And blew up all their Plots by Countermines. Nor was his Conduct so extreamly foul, Or wide of others who'd enjoy'd the Rule, But that some Persons who condemn'd his Ways, Would mix his odious Infamy with Praise, And modestly allow, altho' he trod The Paths of Hell, and waded deep in Blood, That he perform'd such mighty things, that none But a brave wicked Rebel could have done: And therefore tho' he boldly cut his Way Thro' Blood and Treason to the Sov'reign Sway, He justly claims the Wreath from all before, Or since, that e'er usurp'd the Regal Pow'r. And as his Life was wondrous, so his last Expiring Breath became a stormy Blast, That blew down Turrets, tore up sturdy Trees, Rent Ships asunder, and enrag'd the Seas: As if Rebellious Lucifer, with all His Troops that shar'd in his Eternal Fall, Mounted on Whirlwinds, were in Triumph come, To guard him safe to his Infernal Home, Lest his proud Spirit in its Flight should force The Springs of Nature, stop the Spheric Course, And trait'rously unlink the Universe. THE CHARACTER OF IRETON. A scholar bred, but too much Time had spent In Books against Monarchick Government; From whence he'd arm'd his Mind &amp; Tongue with Stings So venomous against the Pow'r of Kings, And in his Breast establish'd such a great Opinion of a free Republick State, That nothing could his Prejudice remove, Or from a Commonwealth withdraw his Love. Some Progress in the Laws he'd also made, And what was best for his ill Purpose read; Was of a Temper much reserv'd, and hung A silent Padlock on his wary Tongue, Which seldom he remov'd, and when he did Took special Care to keep the Motive hid: Nor was his Father Cromwel curs'd or bless'd With greater Cunning than the Son possess'd; Which useful Vertues rais'd the Worthy high In Nol's Esteem, who did at length comply To Hon'r 'im with his Daughter for a Bride, That true-bred Rebels might be multiply'd, Bound him a Man according to his Heart, In Treason vers'd, in Mischief so expert, That he rely'd upon him more than all His other Counsellors, when General; And e're he climb'd into the Regal Seat, Did Ireland to his Management submit, And left him to compleat that cruel Scene, In which himself so barbarous had been; But e're the Son, pursuant to his Will, Had lavish'd all that Blood he meant to spill, The Plague at Lim'rick stop'd the Rebel's Breath, And sacrific'd his Corps to grinning Death. 'Tis strange, that Man, if he believes a God, Should swim to Pow'r thro' Seas of Christian Blood; But vile Ambition no Compassion knows, The more she kills the fiercer still she grows, And were it not for Sickness and the Grave, One half she'd Murder and the rest Enslave. A.D. 1655. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Seventh Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1655. The English Fleet, which had before subdu'd Barbadoes to Rebellious Servitude, And were from thence conducted, by the Care Of Ascue, home, in the Batavian War, Were now sent back, and by Command of Nol, Sail'd from Barbadoes to Hispaniol, To Plunder St. Domingo, which was thought, In all the Spanish Isles the richest Spot; But Venables, the Gen'ral of the Fleet, Relying on his Wife's superior Wit, Whom the wise Chief had brought on Board, as one Most useful in the Expedition, Happen'd to Land his Men, through her Mistake, Too far from the Rich Town they meant to Sack, That tho' the English were Ten-thousand strong, Their distance was so great and March so long, That the Domingo Spaniards, who had fled When first they saw the Fleet, now made a-head, And taking Courage, tho' they were but few, Compel'd their Foes to bid the Isle adieu, Saving their Wealth, which they had surely lost, If tim'rous Woman had not rul'd the roast. When disappointed thus they steer'd their Course More Westward, and descended with their Force Upon Jamaica, and possess'd that Place, By cruel Means too bloody to express. But claims of Nations, and the Rights of Kings, Too often flow from sanguinary Springs. The Western Royal Party now arose, In order to defy their Rebel Foes; But Cromwel, who was always well prepar'd, By cunning Spies, to stand upon his Guard, Soon quench'd the Flame, and turn'd their good Intent To th'Int'rest of himself and Government, By taking Men of Note, secur'd his Ease, And fill'd his Prisons with his Enemies, Deliv'ring up such Persons to his Court Of Justice, as he thought could do him hurt. Penruddock, tho' he'd Articl'd before, Surrender'd, was condemn'd at Exeter, With Captain Grove, submitted to the Stroke Of Fate, and perish'd by the Axe and Block. Thus did they cut off those who had the best Estates, and made their Markets of the rest. Nol disappointed of the mighty Sum Of Gold he hop'd his Navy would bring home From St. Domingo, now resolv'd to fleece, By a new Stratagem the Royalists, And, without Act of Parliament, extort A Tenth of their Estates tow'rds his Support; And that the Money might with greater ease Be forc'd from his unwilling Enemies, Into Eleven Parts he did divide The Land, o'er each appointing to preside, A Major-Gen'ral, trusted with the Care Of Ent'ring all who Disaffected were Upon a List, what Value their Estates, That they from thence might make a Book of Rates, By which the Cavaliers, or such as they Thought fit to style so, were oblig'd to pay. But had a needy Lawful Monarch done The like, what Clamours would have storm'd the Throne! Or had King Charles the First oppress'd the Saints With such a Hardship, in his greatest Wants, How then would they have griev'd at Sov'reign Pow'r, Who'd rail'd so much at Ship-money before. But as lewd Husbands wrong their Wives to please And gratify their craving Mistresses, So Rebels rob their King for want of Grace, To raise some bold Usurper in his Place. Besides the mighty Sums that Cromwel got By th'Decimation which he put on Foot, His Major-Gen'rals aw'd and so oppress'd The sev'ral Destricts where the Wolves were plac'd, That they enrich'd themselves as well as him Who made them Agents in this Stratagem; Suspecting whom they pleas'd, and plund'ring all That were not zealous for Protector Nol, Altho' they liv'd in Peace to save their Gold, And did a Candle to the Devil hold: But bare Suspicion was, alas, enough, If Rich, there was no need of further Proof, Their Money was a Capital Offence, And their Estates sufficient Evidence: Gromwel, besides, by this Device became Inform'd of all Mens Worth that were of Name, And had continual Notice from his Spies, How Matters pass'd in noted Families; By which he made himself the more secure, And knew the better how to use his Pow'r. The Fleet, in August, was by Gen'ral Penn, Or greatest part thereof, brought home again; And not long after Venables return'd, Scoff'd by the Vulgar, by his Betters scorn'd, And for his scandalous Mismanagement At St. Domingo, to the Tow'r was sent: But Cromwel having Reasons to suppose, His Fault from Folly, not Design, arose, Took pity on the poor Uxorious Saint, And soon discharg'd him from his close Restraint. The Duke of Glouc'ster, as the King desir'd, Left the French Court, and to the Hague retir'd; From whence his Sister did in Splendor bring The Royal Youth to Cologne, where the King Resided, whilst his Brother York remain'd In Paris, till forbid the Gallick Land; For Peace 'twixt Nol and France was brought to bear, And an End put to that unactive War Proclaim'd November 28., Upon Condition Lewis should exclude From his Dominions all the Royal Blood Of England, their Adherents, Friends, and those Who should in any kind their Cause espouse. By which, in Princes Courts, we plainly see, That Honour's but a Tool to Policy, Which as their Int'rest, Safety, or their Pride Require, is taken up or laid aside. But that which more inclin'd the French to close With Cromwel, upon Terms so scandalous, Was a fresh Breach of the late Peace 'twixt Spain And England, now turn'd Enemies again, Friendship by Nature being then deny'd, Between the Courts of Paris and Madrid; Which Mortal Hatred nothing but a wild Confed'rate Project could have reconcil'd. The King, when first the Treaty was begun, Foreseeing what a length the French would run, Wisely withdrew in time, and would not stay To be with base Dishonour forc'd away, And, as already said, for Glouc'ster sent, Before th'ingrateful time of Banishment; But York remain'd, by reason of his Post, Till by Command he left the Gallick Host, Receiving also Notice from the Helm Of France, by such a time, to quit the Realm; Which the twice exil'd Duke, when he had paid His parting Compliment at Court, obey'd, Steering his Course for Spanish. Flanders, with a Train Of Loyal English Lords and Gentlemen, That he might waste his Leisure and confer With his two Brothers then residing there; Whither the Banish'd Duke no sooner came, But Don of Austria, in the Spaniard's Name, Sent a Great Count Fuensaldague. of Spain, in publick State, With a kind Message to congratulate His safe Arrival, also to assure, Whate'er was in his Royal Master's Pow'r, To serve and to assist him, should be done, Whilst he remain'd in his Dominion; Which Gen'rous Friendship was embrac'd with Joy, And cherish'd by a suitable Reply. Thus injur'd Princes, when they're banish'd Home, The special Care of Providence become, Which, if they're Vertuous, never fails to raise Some able Friend to succour'm in Distress. The End of the Seventh Year, concluding with the Death of that Most Reverend Prelate, Dr. James Usher, Archbishop of Armagh. THE CHARACTER OF Colonel Penruddock. A loyal Worthy, of a Wiltshire Race, Forward to serve his Sov'reign in Distress, A Man whose Parts were eminently great, And Master of a plentiful Estate; Which Worldly Comforts his Heroick Soul Despis'd, beneath the base Usurper's Rule. Whilst his wrong'd Prince was wandring up and down The World, divested of his Lawful Throne, Therefore, with others, he conspir'd the Fall Of the proud Tyrant and Protector Nol, Took Sal'sbury, and successfully begun The hopeful Project they were driving on, Till distant Friends not answering their Hopes, And some Divisions happ'ning in their Troops, After one fatal Contest with their Foes, They were so far o'erpowr'd, that in the close Of the Dispute they thought it best to yield, On Terms for Life concerted in the Field; But Cromwel, notwithstanding, soon sent down Commissions to some Creatures of his own, To try such Leading Persons as he thought Had been the Chief Contrivers of the Plot; Among the rest whose Lot it was to fall A bleeding Sacrifice to angry Nol, Penruddock was appointed to be one Whose Life was to attone for what they'd done, Who, tho' he made an excellent Defence, So full of Law, and so adorn'd with Sence, That all the list'ning crowded Court were charm'd, To hear a Tongue with so much Reason arm'd; Yet nothing would avail that could be said, No cogent Plea could save so Learn'd a Head, Which, like a Christian Champion he resign'd At Exeter., Glory'ng in Death with Constancy of Mind, Greatly lamented by his Friends, and all That knew his Vertues and beheld his Fall. So di'd the Martyr'd Saints inspir'd with Zeal, That they no Tortures fear'd or Flames could feel, But with undaunted Courage met their Fate, As if they saw Angelick Thousands wait, To guard 'em safe to the Celestial Gate. THE CHARACTER OF Dr. John Hewet. In Norfolk County born, at Cambridge bred, In the best Learning of the Schools well read, A sound Divine, whose pious Life comply'd With all the Duties of a Christian Guide; In Conversation innocently free, His Wit well temper'd with Civility; Which Qualities had in his Youth prefer'd The Worthy Guide to serve that Noble Lord The Earl of Lindsey, whose Esteem he gain'd So far, that his good Life at length obtain'd His Patron's Sister, whom he dearly lov'd; Which happy Match the Earl himself approv'd, Freely consenting that the Noble Maid Should be the Partner of the Doctor's Bed; Which Nuptial Freehold they in Peace possess'd Alike, in Love and mutual Goodness bless'd, Till Cromwel understanding by his Spies, The Royal Party were design'd to rise, And make one gen'ral Struggle to restore Their banish'd Sov'reign to the Regal Pow'r; And having notice that the Loyal Guide Was in the dang'rous Enterprize employ'd, And with Brave Ormond's Marquis, to that End, A Correspondence secretly maintain'd, Was Apprehended by Command of Nol, And brought before him when he bore the Rule, Who having no Respect for Gown or Church, Revil'd the Doctor as a Lighted Torch, Plac'd in the middle of a Sheaf of Corn, A Priest who did by flagrant Doctrines turn The City round him into Flames so great, That threaten'd Mischief to the tott'ring State; Which so provok'd proud Cromwel that he sought His Life, and caus'd the Pastor to be brought Before his Court of Justice, where the Guide, At Bar, their Jurisdictive Pow'r deny'd; And after he'd refus'd three times to Plead, Was, pro Confesso, forc'd to lose his Head, Which, like a pious Martyr, he resign'd, With all the symptoms of a peaceful Mind; As if his Faith had truly overcome The Stings and Terrors of so sharp a Doom. So falls the Christian in a Cause that's good, Depending on his Saviour's precious Blood, Does the last Stroke of Fate unmov'd despise, Assur'd of Joys eternal e're he dies. A.D. 1656. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Eighth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1656. Cromwel, to let the Bubbl'd Nation see The great Regard he had to Piety And Learning, did on Usher's Corps bestow April the 17th., As he deserv'd, a costly Fun'ral Show, In Person did at Westminster attend His Almoner's Oration o'er his Friend; Tho' had he spar'd his Presence and his Cost, It would have better pleas'd the Good and Just, Who mourn'd the Prelate's Exit, or at least, Secur'd the Mem'ry of the Saint Deceas'd, From the Aspersion of his bowing down Too low to such a Tyrant, who had won A Throne by Murder and Rebellion. But 'twas an Artifice that Cromwel us'd, By which the World might be so far abus'd, As to believe the Good Old Man inclin'd To favour what was hateful to his Mind; For such a Bishop who so well could Write And Preach, must doubtless have too clear a sight Of Right and Wrong to favour such a Cause, Repugnant to Divine and Humane Laws. Sev'n English Ships, near Cadiz, chanc'd to meet The Spanish India Fleet, in number Eight, Of which One run a-ground in Cadiz Bay, Two more were burnt, and Three escap'd away, The rest by Captain Commodore. Stainer, after they had fought Some Hours, were taken and to England brought, In which a wealthy Prize of Plate was found, Amounting to Four-hundred-thousand Pound, A welcome Booty to the Rebel Nol, Whose Coffers for Supplies began to call. This being, by the Instrument, a Year Wherein a Parliament were to appear, Accordingly His Highness Issu'd out His Writs to summon the Fanatick Rout: And now his Major-Gen'rals play'd their Game So well, that scarce a Man of Note or Name Durst stand, the Towns and Counties being aw'd By Force, and the Poles manag'd with such Fraud, That few besides themselves, and such good Friends As were dispos'd to answer Cromwel's Ends, Could be elected, tho' their Votes were known To be superior almost two to one: Yet some who disapprov'd of Cromwel's Pow'r, And had declar'd their Discontent before, Made shift to be Return'd, but could not Sit, Unless it should be thought by Council fit, Who had reserv'd the Power In the Instrument of Government. to remove Such Members as they fear'd, or did not Love; So that the Fifth Monarchick Saints, who run Along with their chief Leader Harrison, Were not allow'd to sit, till some new Laws Were made to strengthen Cromwel and his Cause. What therefore signify'd the Peoples Voice, Since those that Govern'd might reject their Choice. Upon the Day appointed September 17., such as were Allow'd to sit, appear'd at Westminster, And made a quick dispatch, like trusty Friends, Of all that might conduce to Cromwel's Ends. A Motion in the House By an Alderman of London. b'ing offer'd near The Expiration of the present Year; That by Petition and Advice they might Endeavour to perswade their Lord to quit The Title of Protector, and to take Upon him that of King, for England's sake. But whether 'twas design'd to do him Good Or Mischief is not rightly understood. Another strange Conspiracy or Plot, Against the Lord Protector, now broke out, Carr'd on by Toop, who was of Cromwel's Guard, And Sindercomb, an Officer cashier'd, Cecil and Bois, the last of whom had been A Priest to an Embassador from Spain, Who had the Wisdom timely to withdraw, And bid defiance to the Partial Law; The rest b'ing taken, two confess'd the Fact, And did the trait'rous Villain doubly act, By giving in their Evidence to hang The second Person mention'd in the Gang; But rather than a publick shameful Death Should be his wretched End he stop'd his Breath, By snushing some strong Poyson up his Head, As 'twas suppos'd by those that found him dead; His Corps b'ing after drag'd at Horses Tail, With his Heels foremost from the Tower Jayl, To a deep Hole beneath the Scaffold made, Wherein the ghastly Spectacle was laid, Pierc'd with a Stake; thus crush'd between two Fates, He sav'd his Quarters from the City Gates. Naylor the Quaking Saint this Year appear'd At Bristol, wearing such a forked Beard, And Head of Hair, compos'd as might agree With those we in the Volto Santon see, Affecting many Phrases which were us'd By Christ, whose Words and Godhead he abus'd, So far as to blaspheme his Holy Name, By preaching up himself to be the same; For which presumptuous Fact he was arraign'd Before the Senate, and by them condemn'd, Through London Streets to be severely whip'd, His Ears in Pillory to be nail'd and clip'd, His Tongue ber'd through, his Forehead mark'd with B To signify his Guilt of Blasphemy; Then sent to Bristol, where he broach'd his Crime, And there to be well flog'd a second time: When thus Corrected, to be brought again To London, and in Bridewel to remain, During their Pleasure who were so remiss In e'ery Point of Justice but in this. Thus Knaves in Pow'r, who climb by wicked means, Are proud to brand the Vulgar for their Sins; And tho' they ne'er encourage or requite Good Deeds, they punish bad thro' Fear or Spite. The End of the Eighth Year. THE CHARACTER OF Fleetwood, Lord-Deputy of Ireland. A Pious Saint, whose Excellence alone Was loudly praying in a formal Tone; By which he gain'd much Rev'rence and Applause, From all th'Enthusions that espous'd the Cause. When first he took up Arms he was no more Than a raw Trooper under Essex's Pow'r, Who'd neither Fortitude nor Brains whereby To raise his Fortune, yet he climb'd so high, By the meer dint of Sanctity, that Nol, Before himself was made Chief General, Bestow'd his Daughter on the praying Saint, Whose highest Merits lay in whining Cant; By which, and his exemplar Gift of Pray'r, He climb'd to be a Gen'ral Officer; And when his Father Nol had grasp'd the Throne, Crush'd all his Foes, and made the Pow'r his own, Fleetwood, who was of those that Judg'd the King, To his last sharp inhumane Suffering, Was, over Ludlow's Head, to Ireland sent As Deputy, to fix that Government, Tho' none of all the Tools that Nol employ'd, Could be for such a Post worse qualify'd; Yet when a Whirlwind snatch'd away the Soul Of his proud Father, and the Sov'reign Rule Devolv'd on Richard, to the great disgust Of Lambert, who was next to Rule the Roast, By Cromwel's Promise, but the Army soon, Who rais'd the new Usurper, pull'd him down, And chose, upon the young Protector's Fall, His Brother Fleetwood Captain-General; The same b'ing done by Lambert's own Consent, Who was himself with the next Post content, Meaning, 'twas thought, to make the Tool his Skreen, As Fairfax had before to Cromwel been. But Providence, in Mercy to the King, Did all their ill Designs to ruine bring, And not long after to the Throne restor'd The Martyr's Son, their Lawful Sov'reign Lord. Thus wicked Men, who think their Crimes the less, Or rather none, 'cause flatter'd with Success, Are in the Zenith of their Pomp o'erthrown, And by the Hand of Providence struck down. THE CHARACTER OF Major-General Desborough, One of Cromwel's Lords. A surly rough-hewn Mortal, and the Spouse Of Cromwel's Sister, as uncouth a Blowze, Rais'd by his Prosp'rous Brother to be Great, Not only in the Army but the State; Yet when a Motion in the House was made, To place the Crown on the Protector's Head, Which by his own ambitious Craft was brought About, as most of his Associates thought, None more oppos'd his climbing to be King, Than Desb'rough, or could bolder Reasons bring, Against his taking up the Royal Stile, Which they'd so long been lab'ring to Revile, And render so obnoxious, that the Name Might bury'd lie beneath eternal Shame, Telling his Brother Cromwel to his Face, That whensoe'er he ventur'd to embrace The Crown, tho' now his Friend, he then must be His open and avowed Enemy; Which Threats being seconded by Fleetwood, Vane, And others who had Pow'r to vex his Reign, Made him refuse, as Cæsar did at Rome, The only Prize he lusted to assume. Nor did Old Desb'rough fail, when Nol was gone, To roughly handle his succeeding Son; Was of the Army Faction, who cut short The Puny's Reign, and made him fly his Court, Taking upon themselves the Ruling Care, In which the Lord we treat of had his Share; But wanting Money to subsist their Troops, And having, at so ill a time, no hopes Of raising a Supply, the Soldiers made Revolts and Mutinies, because unpaid, And for the Rump declar'd, who now again Fresh Courage took, and reassum'd their Reign; Desb'rough's own Regiment all proving loose, Withdrew from him and sided with the House, That the Committee Of Safety. were oblig'd to quit The Pow'r Supream, and to the Rump submit. Thus when bad Horsemen venture to bestride The fiery Courser they're unskil'd to ride, They're soon kick'd off; so none can be secure In Thrones, but Princes bred to Sov'reign Pow'r. A.D. 1657. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Ninth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second. Anno Dom. 1657. The Parliament now willing to confer The Royalty of King on Oliver, Pursuant to a Motion, as some say, Design'd to cut his Throat the pleasing'st way, Waited upon His Highness at White-Hall, With a new Scheme, which they were pleas'd to call Th'Humble Petition and Advice, wherein They pray'd he would be crown'd their Sovereign; But Cromwel finding that he could not bring The Army to consent he should be King, After some Hesitations and Delays, And sundry Answers full of Hems and Ha's, Was forc'd, alas, to finally refuse The only Blessing he was loath to lose. However, he approv'd their good Intent So well, and their new Scheme of Government, That tho' he fear'd to take the sacred Name Of King, and to accept the Diadem, His Highness with their Model did agree, And was afresh Install'd accordingly Westminster-Hall, June 26., With all the Royal Emblems but the Crown, Presented him by Speaker Withrington Sir Thomas;, Who to their proud sham Monarch first resign'd A Purple Velvet Robe with Ermines Lin'd; Next they profan'd the Word of God and gave A Bible gilt to the Imperious Knave, And then bestow'd on their Usurping Lord, A golden Scepter and a costly Sword. And thus regal'd the Sov'reign Rebel sate, Enthron'd beneath a Canopy of State, Whilst the shrill brazen Trumpet thrice defy'd And challeng'd those who durst the Banes forbid: Which being done, Clarenceux, to the shame Of Britain, did the daring Wolf proclaim, As Lord-Protector of the Commonwealth Of the Three Kingdoms, thus usurp'd by stealth, For all were weary of the Yoke they bore, But knew not how to snap the Chains they wore. When thus Install'd, the Upstart Monarch Nol Return'd in solemn Triumph to Whitehal, Having all giv'n him but the Name alone Of King, to warrant and compleat his Throne, Which he, no doubt, expected he should gain, Before he'd finish'd his Rebellious Reign. The Senate, who had run most smoothly on, From last September to the Month of June, On the same Day that they in Pomp Install'd, And made a new Protector of their old, Adjourn'd themselves, and for their Meeting fix'd The twenti'th Day of January next; Having first pass'd the foll'wing Bills, to shew How far they were to Cromwel's Int'rest true. Imprimis, (that the King might see their Spite) An Act to disannul Charles Stuart's Right. A second made in order to secure The Lord Protector's Person and his Pow'r. A third to hinder Building round the Town, Within Ten Miles, obliging e'ery one That should erect a House, to pay the whole Of a Year's Rent to the Protector Nol. They also kindly voted to maintain The War His Highness had begun with Spain, Declaring that the same was made upon Just Grounds, and should be push'd with Vigour on. Thus e'ery thing, as if decreed by Fate, Conspir'd to make the Prosp'rous Rebel Great, Who, by his last Instalment gain'd much more Of Sov'reign Pow'r than he could boast before; Also obtain'd the Freedom to appoint His next Successor to the Government: He therefore now put on a Kingly Air, And did with much more Majesty appear, Had in his Court all Officers of State, His Body-Guard attending at his Gate, A Band of lusty Yeomen, strong and tall, To guard his Presence and to grace his Hall; To his own Palace for his Children sent, That the coarse Brood his Grandeur might augment, Assuming all things that a King could need, Besides the Diadem to Crown his Head; Made firm and good Alliances abroad, Grew strong at Home, and distant Nations aw'd; Thro' all the Parts of Europe spread his Fame, And Reign'd a pow'rful King without the Name. But that which in some measure did allay The Triumphs of his new Imperial Sway, Was the great Loss of Reynolds Sir John., who had been The Gen'ral of the English against Spain, And in that War in Flanders carry'd on, Had Honour gain'd, and signal Service done; But in a bad tempestuous Passage o'er From Holland was, with White Colonel. and many more, Forc'd by a Storm upon the Goodwin Sand, And perish'd in the sight of English Land. Blake, that successful General at Sea, Early this Year The latter end of April. obtain'd a Victory O'er the Plate-Fleet, as they for shelter lay At Santa Cruze, in a commodious Bay, Commanded by a Castle, under which They thought no Danger could their Shipping reach. However, Blake and Stayner ventur'd in, And with Broadsides began the bloody Scene, Burnt and sunk sev'ral of the Spanish Fleet, And with less Number gave them a Defeat, Returning Home with Honour and Renown, Too great for him who had usurp'd the Throne; Tho' Cromwel had the Grace to well Reward Blake, and the rest who in the Vict'ry shar'd, The Brave Commander, who so oft had done Such timely signal Services, and won So many famous Battles on the Seas, Dying (retir'd to his Eternal Ease) Soon after he from Santa Cruze had brought New Laurels home, the last for which he fought. Cromwel, who now was Monarch, tho' no King, By the new Model was oblig'd to bring Another House in play, tho' not of Lords, That as they'd mangl'd with their impious Swords The good old Constitution, to their Shame, They might rebuild up something like the same, And from its Ruins try to raise a poor Resemblance of the State they'd crush'd before; Accordingly the Rebel-Monarch chose Such Officers in whom he could repose A Confidence, and summon'd about Ten Of the Old Nobles to this new Divan; But of that Number there appear'd but Four, The rest were discontented at his Pow'r, And rather disobey'd the Tyrant's Call, Than become Members of his Mock-Cabal, Which were design'd, when first brought into use, To Counterfeit the Lords or Upper-House; Yet could not take upon themselves, for shame, The House of Peers, that venerable Name, But, like their Maker Cromwel, proud and vile, Usurp'd the Pow'r without the ancient Stile. One Branch of Tyranny, which Nol enjoy'd Before his last Instalment, now was void, He and his Council being both debar'd From shutting out such Members as they fear'd Might ruffle their Affairs, and give such Stops And Rubs as might defeat their further Hopes; For now all Persons, whether Friends or Foes, Had liberty to sit, if fairly chose, Except the Houses, upon just Complaint, By Vote, should throw 'em out of Parliament: This Article did to their Seats restore All those who had secluded been before, Which brought great Disadvantage unforeseen By Nol, who had in this outwitted been; For tho' he'd us'd his utmost Care and Pow'r, By Friends, to make the Upper-House secure, He'd weaken'd much his Int'rest in the Low'r, By calling into his Sham House of Peers, The best of his most trusty Commoners; Which gave his Enemies, who sate below, So large a Scope to work his Overthrow, That they began, as soon as e'er they met, To shew their Teeth, and by Debates to whet Their Malice, having no regard to those Who had no Title but the Other House, Calling in Question all that had been done From the first Hour the Parliament begun, During the time that many, who'd a fair Pretence to sit and Vote, secluded were; That Nol's new Empire, giv'n him by his late Instalment, now grew matter of Debate: Which so inflam'd the angry Tyrant's Breast, That he took Hackney at White-Hall for haste, And, lighting in the Palace-Yard, surpriz'd The Upper-House, and, tho' by Friends advis'd Against such Rashness, for the Commons sent, And in a Heat dissolv'd the Parliament; First shewing his Resentments in a bold Tyrannick haughty Speech, wherein he told The Commons, that no Man alive could say He ever sought the Rule, which Burthen they Had laid upon him, therefore ought to make The same sit safe and easy on his Back; Adding, that as the Legislative Pow'r Devolv'd on them, and they had made it sure To him, by their Instalment, it became Their Duty, doubtless, to make good the same: With many odd Excursions, to disclose His warm Displeasure to his List'ning Foes; And did with these harsh Words his Speech conclude, I must dissolve ye, By the Living God; And so dismiss'd 'em, whilst his Foes, in scorn, Cry'd out aloud, Amen to't, in return. This Year the Fifth Monarchists meant to rise, But Cromwel having Notice by his Spies, Timely prevented their intended Scene, And took the Leading Saints at Mile-end-Green, Tom Venner, Ashton, Hopkins, Gowler, Gray, With Arms that for their purpose ready lay, It being their Intent to march and join Their Country Friends, prepar'd for the Design; Harrison also was secur'd by Nol, And Lawson, who had been Vice-Admiral, With Colonel. Rich and Major. Danvers, who were thought to be Abettors in this new Conspiracy; For those who had prepar'd the bloody Way, Grew mad that Cromwel had ingross'd the Sway, And thought they had an equal Right with him To Rule the Roast and share the Pow'r Supreme, That e'ery jarring Side were bent to make His Reign uneasy and his Empire shake. So Wolves, to hunt their Prey, united run, And then divide and quarrel when they've done. The King in Flanders having call'd from France, Some English, Scotch, and Irish Regiments, Which he kept up in hopes to serve his Ends, By wafting them to join his English Friends Upon Occasion, but their Councils here Were so betray'd by Spies to Oliver, That no Design was likely to succeed, Tho' ne'er so well concerted and agreed; Which the King finding, gratefully resign'd His Little Army to his Spanish Friend, Who wanted Men, like them, in Battle skill'd, To shew a Brave Example in the Field, By which his Graver Troops might be inspir'd With hardier Courage than they'd yet acquir'd. Princes delight their Quarrels should be fought By Slaves who boldly perish on the Spot, Whilst they in Safety do their Temples crown With Laurels, by their bleeding Armies won. The End of the Ninth Year. THE Duke of Ormond's CHARACTER. An Irish Peer of ancient Noble Birth, A gallant Person of exemplar Worth, Immovably Sincere, and always bore A Loyal Rev'rence tow'rds the Sov'reign Pow'r: None more Industrious to support the Throne, And to preserve the Best of Kings thereon; Labour'd the Royal Int'rest to advance, In England, Scotland, Ireland, and in France; None shewing more activity to heal Those Wounds kept open by Intemp'rate Zeal, Or could with more Integrity deport Himself in Arms, or in his Prince's Court; Rising by Merit, which was truly great, First from an Earldom to a Marquisate; And for the faithful Service he had done His Injur'd Sov'reign and his Royal Son, Was, by the Latter, to the next Degree Of Honour rais'd, for his Fidelity; Also confirm'd in the Presiding Pow'r Of Ireland, which His Grace had held before: Where, to all Sides, he gave such full Content, By his Discreet and Gen'rous Management, And kept a Court, in Honour to his Prince, Aggrandiz'd with such true Magnificence, That the Great Duke of Ormond was his Style, Thro' England, Scotland, and his Native Isle, Where they adore his Mem'ry and his Name, And o'er his Ashes daily sing his Fame. Thus Great Mens Vertues in the Grave take Root, And o'er the Tomb their fragrant Branches shoot, Whilst Rotting Traitors turn to stinking Weeds, As Rank and Loathsome as their odious Deeds. THE Marquis of Argyle's CHARACTER. A noble cunning Scot, who plaid his Game With too much Caution to preserve his Fame; 'Twixt King and Covenant his Course he steer'd, To both at once a seeming Friend appear'd; As if in Times of Danger he was free To please all Sides for his Security: No Obligations from the Crown refus'd, Nor any Trust to its advantage us'd: Was Honour'd by the King Made a Marquis., kept close at Court, Did him no good, nor the Scotch Rebels hurt; But wisely study'd honestly to play The Cards for both, but could not find the way, Faring like those who meddle with the Strife 'Twixt a vex'd Husband and provoking Wife. When his Good Sov'reign, who had us'd him well, By the base Treachery of Scotland, fell Into the Rump's vile Hands, the Marquis then United close with Cromwel and with Vane, And quite forgot the best of Friends and Kings, In Prison bound amidst his Sufferings, Thinking it time to make his Int'rest good With those who sought his Royal Master's Blood: Not that he join'd his Foes through Love of them, Or Hatred to the King, his Just Supream, But meerly thro' the want, as most agree, Of Honour, Courage, and Integrity. When the Scotch Senate, with so good a Will, Prepar'd and Pass'd the Proclamation Bill, For Charles the Second, which the Marquis found He could not hinder, yet to shew his sound Affection to the Kirk, much Pains he spent To clog it with the Holy Covenant; By which His Grace much Reputation gain'd With the good Clergy of that Pious Land; Yet when the King came over for the Crown Of Scotland, plac'd upon his Head at Schone, None were more ready than the crafty Scot, To bid him Welcome, tho' he lik'd him not. But when he found His Majesty too wise And cautious to be steer'd by his Advice, He left the King and to his House retir'd, To cool his Breast, with much Resentment fir'd. Since mighty Men can break the strongest Ties Religion can enjoin, or Law devise, Well may the savage Croud from Duty swerve, Who know no better than to Slave and Starve. A.D. 1658. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Tenth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1658. Early this Year the Spaniards to regain Jamaica, Landed Forces, but in vain; For by the English they were soon o'erthrown, Their Leader Francisco de Prencia. taken, and his Troops undone. In Flanders also Cromwel's Arms prevail'd, And sent him home fresh Laurels from the Field, Where English Lockart Lord., and the Brave Turenne, Against the Spaniards had successful been, And with a swift and fortunate Career, Did from one Conquest to another steer, Took strong Mardike, from thence to Dunkirk went, Which they Besieg'd, and after they had spent Some time, were by the Spaniards utmost Force Attack'd, which they soon routed Foot and Horse, Took many Nobles Pris'ners, and renew'd The Siege till they the Town and Fort subdu'd, Which, tho' surrender'd first to Mazarine, The Cardinal thought proper to resign To Cromwel, which was smoothly done, without The least Objection, Cavil, or Dispute. So careful were the French to do whate'er Might curry Favour with the Rebel here. The Royalists were now inclin'd to rise, But Nol was so precaution'd by his Spies, That he took timely Measures to prevent The Plot design'd against the Government, And fill'd his Jayls with such as he surmis'd Were of this new Conspiracy appriz'd; Indicted many and Convicted some, Who suffer'd Death according to their Doom; Slingsby Sir Henry. and Hewet Doctor. were among the rest Condemn'd to Sledge and Gallows, but redress'd So far, as only to submit their Necks To the hard Block and the dividing Axe June the 8th on Tower-Hill., Whose fatal Strokes have sent so many Brave Heroick Worthies to the silent Grave, As well as Numbers who have justly felt The same as an attonement for their Guilt. However, Cromwel, tho' he countermin'd By Craft whate'er the Royalists design'd; Yet, since his last Establishment, his Mind Was to strange Fears and Jealousies inclin'd, Strongly conceiting he should be destroy'd By some bold Champions of the Royal Side, Who, in Revenge, would give a daring Blow, That should at once compleat his Overthrow; Which frightful Dreams, we justly may suppose, From nothing but his own black Guilt arose: For Conscience, tho' 'tis stifl'd for a time, Still keeps account of e'ery barb'rous Crime, And, when we least expect it, will perplex Our Souls with past Offences and Mistakes. However, tho' these Conflicts had possess'd And terrify'd the Tyrant's conscious Breast, They prov'd but false Allarms, for there appear'd No such Attempts as he so greatly fear'd; For Heav'n decreed he gradually should bear The Stings of Conscience, Sickness and Despair, And waste beneath the Terrors of the Guilt Of all the Wrongs he'd done and Blood he'd spilt. To usher in his own approaching Fate, That put a period to his Sov'reign State, His Daughter Cleypole, whom he lov'd the best Of all his Children, and the most caress'd, Resign'd her Breath August the 6th at Hampton-Court., when she had long endur'd Such Pains as could be neither eas'd nor cur'd, Arising, as 'twas thought by Men of Art, From an Imposthume in some Inward Part; Under which Misery she much exclaim'd Against her Father's Cruelties, and blam'd His barb'rous Usage of the King, and cry'd She felt the Suff'rings of the Royal Side, And smarted for the Evils he had done, To raise himself into another's Throne; With many such Expressions, which, till weak With Sickness, she perhaps might fear to speak, Tho' in her Health she never could be won T'approve of what her Rebel Sire had done; Yet Cromwel at her Death was so concern'd, That all his Pomp was into Sadness turn'd: But that which fed and made his Sorrow worse, Was the deportment of his Officers, Who with his single Rule seem'd much displeas'd, And had a Faction in the Army rais'd, Who were preparing, as he found, by stealth, To change his Scepter to a Commonwealth: Fleetwood, by Marriage, Cromwel's Son-in-Law, And his own Sister's Husband Desborow, Having Confed'rated with Four, by Name Cooper and Berry, Pick'ring, Sydenham; The first two Col'nels, and the last two sate In Council, and were trusted with the State: These were the leading Junto, who were bent To ruffle the Protector's Government, And to seduce the Army to agree Once more to set up Rump-Democracy; The fear of which arising on the Death Of Cromwel's dear belov'd Elizabeth, So chill'd his Spirits that, at Hampton-Court, An Ague seiz'd him, of the Tertian sort, And handl'd him so roughly, that he soon Was glad to leave that Palace for the Town, Tho' in his Intervals he oft would boast, And ravingly affirm, The Lord of Host Would still reserve him to perform more great And wondrous Works than he'd accomplish'd yet. In which Enthusiastick flight of Hope His Chaplain, Doctor Goodwin, buoy'd him up, Till both the Saints were so convinc'd, at length, By his low Pulse, and his declining Strength, That a few Days would put a dreadful End To all his mighty Pomp so basely gain'd, And then he thought 'twas time to name his Son Richard as his Successor to the Throne August 31., Which Pow'r the Parliament thought fit to grant Upon his last Supreme Establishment. So that when thus he'd spoke his Mind before Two Persons first Thurloe and Doctor Goodwin., and afterwards Three more Fiennes, Whaley, and Goffe., Who all, excepting one, were of the Nine Whom Cromwel had of late thought fit to join In a Committee, chiefly with Intent To ease him in Affairs of Government, The dying Wonder of that impious Age Had nought to do upon this worldly Stage, But to prepare his sad expiring Soul, Of Anguish, Horror, and Amazement full, To make her dismal trembling Exit hence, Struck with Despair and loaded with Offence, Which he resign'd, upon the Day whereon He had two great and famous Vict'ries won Dunbar and Worcester, Septemb. 3., And always had esteem'd the same to be Remarkable for his Prosperity: But as the Tyrant on his Death-Bed lay, The Night that usher'd in the fatal Day, Allarm'd the Nation with a Storm so fierce, As if his Groans had shook the Universe, And that the Exit of so proud a Soul Had kindl'd Civil Wars from Pole to Pole, And threaten'd Dissolution of the whole. Richard, according to his Father's Will, Succeeded in the Pow'r obtain'd so ill, And after he'd expensively Interr'd The dead Usurper, as his Friends desir'd, The Army wheresoe'er dispers'd, address'd Their new Protector, and his Right confess'd, Whilst those Commanders who were then in Town, Lifted him up into his Sov'reign Throne; Not doubting now but they should soon outwit And Rule their Ruler as themselves thought fit, Who had no Military Acts perform'd: Nor was he with due Resolution arm'd, But simply thought that those who rais'd him up, Would still Obey and be his faithful Prop: But Lambert, now the Darling of the Host, Having therein regain'd a Col'nel's Post, By slily courting Fleetwood to become Protector in the Puppit Richard's room, So tamper'd with the Soldiers that they soon Began to think of pulling Richard down, And to reform the Pow'r they thought too great For one, into a more divided State: Accordingly some Hotspurs of the Sword Met daily at a House call'd Wallingford, Where Fleetwood dwelt As is said by Hobbs; but Baker reports it to be the House of Desborough., that they might there consult Of Measures how the Army should Revolt; That when themselves once more the Pow'r had got, They might set up they scarce indeed knew what; For 'twas a constant Method thro' the whole Rebellion, with the Saints to rend and pull Their Rulers down, before they'd well agreed What Form of Government should next succeed; For their chief Aim was to improve their own Estates, by plund'ring those they'd o'erthrown, And then to build up such a Pow'r as might Confirm their Rob'ries into Lawful Right. The new Protector was not unappriz'd Of their Designs, and therefore was advis'd By his best Friends to kill the Chief of those That did in Council meet at Fleetwood's House; But wanting Courage he refus'd Consent, And rather chose to call a Parliament; In which he only could propose to shun Caribdis, but must needs on Scylla run. However, Writs were issu'd to require A Parliament forthwith at Westminster, Where both the Houses did pursuant meet, And on the Day assign'd January the 27th. began to sit: The Commons minding only to Ingross The Pow'r, had no regard to t'other House; Or did they Speak or Act as if intent On Richard's Safety or Establishment; But took themselves to be alone Supream, Without his Upper House of Lords or Him. And when His Highness did a Bill prefer, About their Recognition of his Pow'r, They made Additions, that himself might see Therein the Bounds of his Authority, With sev'ral Clauses of a large extent, To secure Privilege of Parliament, The Subjects Liberties, and such like things, With which our Senates us'd to ruffle Kings. Thus had the tame Protector scarce begun His Reign e'er he was more than half undone, And sate in Jeopardy between two Foes, Too fierce to soothe, too pow'rful to oppose. At length the Commons voted to transact With t'other House, but also did exact, That no more Writs of Summons should be sent As unto Peers, when call'd to Parliament, But that they all should be futurely chose In the same manner as the Nether-House. They likewise voted to themselves the Pow'r Of the Militia; also did restore To Liberty some Persons who had been Committed in the late Usurper's Reign, Proceeding unto many Points beside, Concerning Civil Rights, to shew their Pride, Aim'd at no less than as the Rump had done, To make the Legislative Pow'r their own; Coz'ning the silly Crowd the while with fair Pretences of devout uncommon Care, For their Religion, Liberties and Lives, Such Cant that pleases Fools and good Old Wives, And does so oft decoy the Brainless Herd Into those fatal Snares they've always fear'd. So Wolves who into Shepherd's Cloathing creep, With Reformation lull their Flocks asleep, That they may fright 'em, with their hideous cries Of Pop'ry, when they want to have 'em rise, And pull down any Ruling Prince or Pow'r, They're pleas'd to call the Babylonian Whore. The End of the Tenth Year. Major-General Lambert's CHARACTER. A daring Champion in the Good-Old-Cause, Active in Arms and greedy of Applause; In all the Discipline of War well skill'd, Second to none but Cromwel in the Field: Nor did he want Ambition to pursue The same vile Ends, and that the other knew; Who therefore all along took special Care To watch his Motions, tho' he carry'd fair, And us'd the utmost Arts he could devise, To make him Instrumental in his Rise; Promis'd the Major he should always be The Second Person in Authority. And when aspiring Cromwel had obtain'd His Ends, to keep his Rival still his Friend, He made a Promise Lambert should alone Be nam'd his next Successor to the Throne; But dying, had the Grace to break his Word, And choose his Son to the Protecting Sword: Which so affronted Lambert that he soon Remov'd the tim'rous Upstart from the Throne, In hopes to have usurp'd the Government Himself, but could not gain that knotty Point, Falling so vastly short of Sov'reign Pow'r, That he was made close Pris'ner in the Tow'r; Whence he escap'd, and did again appear With a few Forces in Northamptonshire; But most Revolted when they should have fought And Lambert was retaken on the Spot, Brought up before the State, and for his Crime Committed to the Tow'r a second time, Where he remain'd till e'ery neighb'ring Gun, About his Ears, proclaim'd the Royal Son, Whose Father's Life he had so often sought, And with his Fellows to destruction brought: For which himself was try'd, and doom'd to die, But rescu'd by forgiving Clemency, Living Confin'd near Thirty Years in Jayl, Till Death took Pity and became his Bail. Thus Pride, who strikes the Eye of Reason blind, With Rainbow Shadows tempts the soaring Mind Into her hellish Traps and fatal Snares, Then leaves the Bubble to his Sighs and Pray'rs. THE CHARACTER OF Colonel Ludlow. A stubborn bold Fanatick, well supply'd With Courage, Malice, Sanctity and Pride; Who thought it meritorious to pull down Those Babylonian Idols, Church and Crown, Like a true Saint, believing there could be No Wickedness on Earth but Popery; And that whate'er themselves were pleas'd to style As such, they might with a safe Conscience spoil And plunder all as Papists, who refus'd To serve the Cause the Rebel-Herd espous'd. By such Fanatick barb'rous Zeal as this, The Traytor Ludlow prosper'd by degrees, Till from a Captain he, at length, became Of Horse a Col'nel, still pursuing Fame, In a wrong Path, till he'd at last a Call To be Lieutenant-General to Nol; And after Ireton died, had sole Command Of all the Forces in the Irish Land, Till Cromwel kick'd his Masters out of Door, And gave to Fleetwood the Hibernian Pow'r. Ludlow endeav'ring after to inflame That Kingdom, made by cruel Usage tame, Holding a Correspondence with a Fry'r, The better to revive the smother'd Fire, Made his own Markets of the Captive Croud, Who in those bloody Wars had been subdu'd; Hang'd whom he pleas'd, sav'd others for their Gold, And droves of Wretches to Plantations sold; Grew Rich and Prosper'd, till the Royal Son Return'd in Glory to possess his Throne: And then the Regicide, to save his Head From London-Bridge, to Foreign Regions fled; Where, with some other Traytors, he remain'd, Till to a wretched Life Death put an end. Would Men delib'rate on the common Fate, That does on base perfidious Greatness wait, They'd never toil, with Infamy, to win What ends in Mis'ry, as 'tis gain'd in Sin. A.D. 1659. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Eleventh Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second. Anno Dom. 1659. Among the divers Acts this First and Last Of tott'ring Richard's Parliaments had pass'd, The chief was to forbid and to disperse The Council or Cabal of Officers. Another, that no Man should hold Command I'th' Army, who refus'd to set his Hand To an Engagement, strictly to prevent Their Molestation of the Parliament; But that all Members should be free to sit, And to debate whate'er the House thought fit. Also, to please the Soldiery, they made A Vote that their Arrears should soon be paid. But all this would not pacify the Heat O'th' Officers, who were forbid to meet: So that the Government, which was before But ill cemented in its Parts of Pow'r, Now fell at once in Pieces, e'ery Limb Contending warmly which should be supreme; Richard, the Army, and the Parliament, B'ing all alike against each other bent, No Side to their establish'd Compact true, But e'ery Branch against the other two. The Officers who sate at Fleetwood's House, Were now so stubborn and imperious, That they with sev'ral Troops came down upon White-Hall, with a Commission ready drawn, Thereto requiring Sov'reign Dick's assent, That Desb'rough might dissolve the Parliament; Which the Protector sign'd in a surprise, In truth, not daring to do otherwise; The Parliament, however, had the Grace To still continue sitting sev'ral Days, Till they adjourn'd, at the Week's end, to meet On Monday foll'wing April 25., but 'twas then thought fit, By th'Officers, to Barricade the Door, And guard the House that they should sit no more. Which render'd all the Senate's Projects vain, And put an end, at once, to Richard's Reign; Who, having little now to do in Town, Retir'd into the Country, where he soon Resign'd his Pow'r, on Promise they'd discharge His Debts, by's Father's Funeral made large. And thus, at once, their Government by One Was so dissolv'd, that they were Rul'd by None. In which ill State the Nation stood perplex'd, Ten Days, not knowing who'd be Masters next, Till Lambert, Haslerig, and many more Rump Officers, i'th' Army Men of Pow'r, Restor'd their Speaker Lenthal, with a Crew Of the old Rump, in number Forty two, All they could muster up in Town, who'd been The Butchers of their Lawful Sovereign, Turn'd out by Oliver in Fifty-three, When he assum'd Supreme Authority, Which from his tim'rous Son again devolv'd On those the Father had long since dissolv'd. And now again the Rump, by the consent O'th' Army, were declar'd the Parliament, Enter'd the House, and reassum'd that Pow'r They'd been so long divested of before: Nor would they 'dmit those Members who had been, By Vote, secluded in their former Reign, Tho' their Election was the same with theirs Who'd now the sole Direction of Affairs; And made a Vote, as early as they met May the 7th., That none, unless they'd sate since Forty-Eight, Should in that present Parliament presume To take his Seat, or as a Member come, Till further Order. Thus the Rump Ingross'd, At once, what they as suddenly had lost. But they who did the Traytors Reinthrone, Soon lent a helping hand to pull 'em down; For Lambert, unto whom Protecting Nol Had promis'd to bequeath the Sov'reign Rule, Expertly skilful in the crooked Road Which his old Gen'ral Oliver had trod, Resolv'd to let slip nothing that might clear The Way and make his Rise the Easier; Was therefore rather willing to restore The Rump, than Richard should maintain the Pow'r, For fear Experience at the Helm might prove, If once well fix'd, a Bar to his Remove. Thus when the Reins to all alike are free, And Government becomes a Lottery, Both Knaves and Fools will hustle Fortune's Dice, In spight of Odds, to win the highest Prize. The Royal Party now began to stir, And some Commotion make in Glouc'stershire; But Major-Gen'ral Massey, who had laid The Scheme, was by an Accident The Interception of a Letter. betray'd, Himself and the Lord Herbert, with some more, B'ing taken by a Troop from Gloucester; But Massey's Horse, by stumbling in his Way, Down a steep Hill of wet and slipp'ry Clay, Rescu'd the Pris'ner from his Guard by Night, And carr'd him off by dint of speedy Flight. The Cheshire Presbyterians also made An Insurrection, chusing to be led By Sir George Booth; but Lambert being sent With Force superior by the Parliament, Suppress'd them soon, and, after Battle, seiz'd Sir George At Newport-Pagnel., as riding up to Town disguis'd, Subduing Chester, Liverpool, and more Such Holds as Booth had taken just before, Returning to his Sov'reign Lords the Rump, With Crouds of Pris'ners in Triumphant Pomp. But e're he came to Town, at his own Cost Had giv'n so kind a Welcome to his Host In Yorkshire, at his Country-Seat, that all Were ready, in return, to stand or fall By such a Noble Bounteous General. This Cunning also won his Troops consent To a Petition to the Parliament, That their Great Wisdom would vouchsafe to call Some proper Person to be General, For that 'twas neither reas'nable nor fit The Army should at such a time submit Toth' Judgment, or depend upon the Care Of those who of itself extrinsick were. Some other Points b'ing added, but of less Importance, for on this they laid their stress; Which Paper, when 'twas lick'd at Fleetwood's House Into such Form as proper for their use, Sign'd by the Army Officers, was sent By th'Hand of Desb'rough to the Parliament October the 4th., Who wisely had, within themselves, till now, Withheld the Pow'r of Gen'ralissimo, And, by their Speaker, in the House gave out Their own Commissions both to Horse and Foot; Rememb'ring well how they'd been serv'd before, By their old crafty Gen'ral Oliver; And therefore thought it was unsafe to trust A second Hero in so high a Post: However, after Lambert had so far Prevail'd in Cheshire and in Lancashire, It aw'd the House to readily agree The Matter should forthwith debated be; Which they perform'd, and prov'd, at length, so stout, As to assert their Courage in a Vote October the 12th., That all Commissions hitherto enjoy'd By Lambert and by Desb'rough, should be void, And of all Officers that held a Board Or Council at the House call'd Wallingford, And that the Army should Commanded be, Till the Twelfth Day o'th' foll'wing Feb'rary, By a Commission granted unto Six Fleetwood, Monk, Haslerig, Walton, Morley, and Overton., On whom the Parliament were pleas'd to fix: And that they might be safe in what they'd done, They order'd two Haslerig and Morley. of those they'd pitch'd upon, To Issue Warrants to each Officer, Whom they thought fit to trust in the Affair, To bring what Force they could next Morning down To Westminster, to guard that End o'th' Town, Expecting those they had discharg'd would play Some Trick to be reveng'd, the foll'wing Day. And as the Rump suspected so it prov'd, For Lambert early with his Soldiers mov'd To Westminster, and lin'd both Palace-Yards And King-street, e're the Rumpers brought their Guards, Turn'd back the Speaker, did the House secure, That not a Member durst approach the Door: Whilst t'other Forces were oblig'd to march Quite round the Park to reach St. Marg'ret's Church, Where, in the Yard, they into Order drew, Both Sides b'ing Posted in each other's view, Expecting e'ery Minute to begin I'th' Street, instead of Field, the bloody Scene; But were diverted, by some good Advice, From fighting, tho' they look'd like Enemies Upon each other, till the Ev'ning's close, Then both drew off and parted without Blows. The Officers who thus dissolv'd the Pow'r O'th' Rump, in Council joining as before, Contin'ing such a Guard as should prevent The further meeting of the Parliament. And thus the Rump, who thought the Rule their own, A second time was from the Saddle thrown. The Army, who maintain'd their Council-Board At their old Plotting House of Wallingford, Among themselves a new Committee coin'd, To which some noted Citizens they join'd: And these now undertook the Ruling Care Of Publick Safety, both in Peace and War, To try Delinquents, treat with Foreign States, Suppress Rebellious Tumults and Debates, That to the Common Danger should arise, Between the Nation's Friends and Enemies. In short, that all Mens Burthens might be eas'd, Meaning their own, they did whate'er they pleas'd. Yet Lambert still retain'd his former Hope, Of climbing, by good Conduct, to the Top; For this Committee were to frame a Scheme, To settle, in six Weeks, the Pow'r Supreme; Yet Lambert must have thought 'em Fools if they Should from themselves have giv'n the same away. For no wise Man can hope that crafty Knaves Made Kings, will by their own free Gift be Slaves. But Monk, who all this while in Scotland lay, Neglected by the Clan that bore the Sway, Having done Greater Service to befriend The Good-Old-Cause, than Lambert could pretend, Began to think it hard the Sword should bear The Rule, and he not worthy of a share; He therefore in a Letter did detest The Managements of Lambert and the rest: Which so surpriz'd 'em that they now began To fear they'd disoblig'd a dang'rous Man. Who in his Northern Army next secures All Baptists, and such other Officers As he suspected would with Lambert side, And with more trusty Friends their Posts supply'd: Then march'd his Forces into Berwick Town, And thither call'd a Scotch Convention; To whom he recommended, first the Care Of Scotland in his Absence, and with fair Engaging Words desir'd they would advance A Sum for his and his Troops Maintenance To London, which they rais'd without Debate, And gave an Aid sufficient, tho' not great, Hoping that England would again renew Her Quarrels, and her Ruine still pursue. The proud Committee Kings, on t'other side, Did for their Safety against Monk provide, And with sufficient Force sent Lambert forth, To meet and to oppose him in the North, At the same time us'd all their Craft to gain A Treaty, which at length they did obtain, So far, that Monk sent Officers to Town, In number Three, with a Commission To treat with Three of theirs, who soon agreed On Terms, wherein Monk's Agents did exceed Their Orders, and consented to exclude The King, to please the Independant Brood; That a free State should also settl'd be, And Care be taken of the Ministry. Which Articles the General refus'd To ratify, and thought himself ill us'd By those he had imploy'd, consining one Colonel Wilks. O'th' Three, who had beyond Commission run. These Ruffles caus'd the Parties to contrive A second Treaty, sending Five to Five: But whilst these Managers were carr'ing on The Bus'ness of Accommodation, Rump Haslerig had seiz'd upon the Town Of Portsmouth, a commodious Garison; And when the Safe Committee sent down Men, In hopes, by Siege, they might the Town regain, They all Revolted, and were glad to join The Presbyterian Forces lodg'd therein; Which gave a sudden Shock, that greatly cool'd The Courage of the Army Saints that rul'd. The City also did in Tumults rise, For a Free Parliament renew'd their Cries. Fairfax, who had the Rump's old Gen'ral been, In Yorkshire levy'd sev'ral Thousand Men, That Lambert now between two Armies lay, Holding no Card that he could safely play. Monk he'd have gladly fought, but durst not do't, Because the Treaty still was kept on Foot. News also came to the Committee's Ear, That they were Listing Men in Devonshire And Cornwal; fresh Amusements e'ery Day Allarming those that had ingross'd the Sway: But that which prov'd still worse, was Lambert's want Of Money, which begot much Discontent Among his Soldiers, who were odious grown, Because they'd nothing to subsist upon Besides Free-Quarter, to their Leader's Shame, Which much enrag'd the Towns where'er they came: Nor could their tott'ring Governours propose To raise Supplies, when so beset with Foes; Did therefore, with Reluctance, now consent To give in their new Scheme of Government: Which was, that a Free Parliament should meet December the 15th., But neither King nor Lords allow'd to sit: Which Limitations made the City more Perverse and Angry than they were before; That now they durst no Forces send from Town, To quell the Westerly Commotion, For fear the City, in this great Disgust, Should pull a Crow with them that Rul'd the Roast. Nor had they Money to defray the Charge Of raising Men, their Army to enlarge: That now the Junto found the wisest way Was to Dissolve and part without delay; In which, as their best Course, they did accord, And so forsook the House of Wallingford. These Tidings soon occasion'd Lambert's Force To leave their needy Gen'ral and Disperse: That now again the Rump, without regard To the new Scheme the Bankrupt Saints prepar'd Before they broke, assembl'd in the House December 26., And did the Pow'r Supreme once more ingross. But still the People's Hearts were so intent Upon a free and speedy Parliament, That this new sudden Change did not impede Monk's March to Town, because the Rump had need Of a good Guard to make themselves secure In their Resumption of the Sov'reign Pow'r; Therefore the wary Northern Gen'ral sent A Message to the Saints in Parliament, To let them know, that as he thought they were Unsafe at present he'd to Town repair, That with his Army he might awe their Foes, From off'ring any Insults to the House, Which they approving, thank'd him for his Care, And voted him a Thousand Pounds a Year. The Gen'ral in his March now timely found The Bent and Temper of the Counties round, From whence Petitions e'ery Day were sent To meet him, praying a free Parliament. The Rump, to give his Army room in Town, Not doubting their old Friend, dislodg'd their own. The Gen'ral trusting no Man with his great Design, nor had he drop'd one Word as yet, Whereby his Friends or Foes could understand, Or guess what mighty Work he had in hand. No sooner was the Gen'ral come to Town, But the proud Senate thought the Day their own, Rowz'd up their Courage, to the City sent For Money, which the last Rump Parliament Had Levy'd as a Tax A Hundred-thousand Pound a Month upon the Kingdom, for Six Months., which they refus'd, Thinking they had too long been hardly us'd; And being now resolv'd upon a Free New Senate, would no longer bubbl'd be, To succour and support the Pride of those They found, too late, to be the Nations Foes. This vex'd the needy Rump, who, out of hand, Did, by an Order of their House, Command Their Gen'ral on the City Gates to seize, And pull 'em down, with their Portcullices; Also to close Imprison certain Great And Leading Persons, who'd been obstinate: All which he fully did at last obey, Tho' not without Exception and Delay. The Grateful House, for which good Service done, Renew'd his General's Commission, Which being granted by the Rump before The Army Officers usurp'd the Pow'r, Was near expir'd, by which he only shar'd A Sixth of the Command; a poor Reward For all the signal Service he had done Those Rebels, who'd subverted Church and Throne. But his Ambitious Masters found, too late, They'd been too Sneaking to a Man so Great. The Gen'ral now, to please the City, sent A Letter to his Lords the Parliament, To let 'em know the Service he had done Against the City, was against his own Opinion, and reminded them how far They'd serv'd the Parliament thro' all the War. Which was indeed too true, for 'twas their Aid That lost the King his Throne, and next his Head. But Rump was much too busy to regard, The Sums the City for the Cause had spar'd, Or to take notice of their Gen'ral's kind Repentance of the Orders they'd enjoin'd, Running full Speed to make themselves secure Against all those that envy'd them the Pow'r, Preparing Abjurations, with Design For ever to exclude the Royal Line, Renewing old Engagements that might bind The Land to be of one Rebellious Mind; Also conferring with their City Friends For Money to supply their present Ends. On such like Projects they were too intent, To rightly scan the Letter Monk had sent; Who thereupon desir'd that he might hear, By a fair Conference, how Matters were Between the Rump and Members, who had been Long since secluded in their former Reign: Accordingly the Parliament comply'd, And Persons were appointed on each Side, Such as both Parties could the best rely Upon, to manage an Affair so high, Who join'd at a fix'd time, and open'd all Their Grievances before the General: But what the Rumpers offer'd in defence Of their Proceedings, was such poor pretence, And with the Gen'ral bore so little Sway, That the secluded Members got the Day; So far, that Monk did with his Army move Into the City, and to win their Love, Did first for a Free Parliament declare, And when he'd done march'd down to Westminster, Did, Vi &amp; Armis, to their Seats restore Those Members who'd been long expel'd before: That now the House were in the self-same State As 'twas in Forty-One and Forty-Eight, Compos'd of the same Men, excepting those Whom Death had summon'd to their last Repose; But were to these two hard Conditions Bound, One to dissolve on March the 17th., a mortal Wound To their ambitious Hopes; the next enjoin'd The House to send out Writs e're they declin'd Their Seats, in order that a speedy, free And able Parliament might chosen be. By these the Rump might easily foreknow The fatal Minute of their Overthrow. Yet now, as soon as Calvin's Zealots sway'd The Senate, Monk was by that Party made Chief General, and had the full Command Of all the English Force by Sea and Land, Took off the old Engagement, which was meant To keep the Presbyters from Government, As well as to exclude the Royal Side, By rend'ring them for Trust unqualify'd; So that 'twas only done to please their own Good Saints, and not the Friends that lov'd the Throne; For now in vain they did whate'er they cou'd, To bar the King and all the Royal Blood, And shew'd, by their Proceedings, they were bent To fix the Sov'reign Pow'r in Parliament. But some of the Rump Leaders who foresaw That things did tow'rd a Restoration draw, Tempted, by all the Arts they could invent, The Gen'ral to accept the Government, Chusing much rather, out of Fear or Spite, To raise up some new Idol, than submit To him who to the Rule alone had Right. So Heathens rather foolishly adore The Gods they make, than the Almighty Pow'r; Because whene'er the Images they frame Disgust 'em they can scoff and burn the same. But the Brave Worthy was too wise by far, To be trepan'd into the dang'rous Snare, And chose, with much more Honour, to pursue The Glorious Ends he justly had in view, Such that might wash away his former Guilt, And drown the Cries of Loyal Blood he'd spilt. So crafty Men, ambitious to be Great, First kindle Broils and Discords in the State, Then cheat their Country both of Wealth and Praise, By conqu'ring Mischiefs which they help'd to raise. The End of the Eleventh Year. THE CHARACTER OF General MONK. Descended of an ancient Loyal Race, Who long had liv'd unspotted with Disgrace, In Devon County, where they held a fair Estate, sufficient for a frugal Heir Who'd spent his Youth in Foreign Wars, between The Haughty Spaniard and the Dutch, wherein He'd great Experience gain'd, with the repute Of b'ing a Skilful Officer of Foot. When first the Troubles in the North begun, Which soon thro' all the British Empire run, He left the Flemish Army and came o'er To England, where he serv'd the Sov'reign Pow'r, With all the Faith and Honour that became A Loyal Subject and a Man of Fame. No sooner had Rebellion rais'd her Head In Ireland, where such Crouds were Massacred, But Col'nel Monk was with Commission sent To Rule the Deputy's own Regiment; And in those Troubles, by his Conduct, won Much Honour, Praise, and Estimation: But when the English Parliament Rebel'd, And forc'd their Injur'd Prince to take the Field, He falsly was suspected to incline To th'Rebels, and to favour their Design: But at Nantwich, soon after, he defy'd, With so much Brav'ry, the Rebellious Side, That none from thence could reas'nably suppose He'd any Will to serve his Prince's Foes; For in that Battle he was Captive made, And by the Rebels to the Tow'r convey'd, Where, under rig'rous Usage, he remain'd, Till his Great Master was himself restrain'd. Then finding that the Royal Cause was lost, And his own Hopes by his Confinement crost, By Cromwel's Importunities was won, To turn his Back upon the sinking Throne; And for the sake of Liberty and great Preferment, that intoxicating Bait, T'espouse the Good-Old-Cause, whose impious Side He had before so zealously defy'd; For his Rump Lords did Wonders on the Seas, Against their proud Batavian Enemies, And was the Bane of Trump, who, to upbraid The English, wore upon his Topmast-head A Broom, to shew he was resolv'd to sweep The English off the Surface of the Deep: Preserv'd a faithful Amity with Nol, Before and after he obtain'd the Rule; And was by him respected, as his best Support, when he the Sov'reign Pow'r possess'd, To awe and govern Scotland was imploy'd, Which Trust he held till after Cromwel di'd; Whose Int'rest, had he liv'd, it was believ'd, His faithful Servant would have ne'er deceiv'd. But when he'd lost his Friend, and found that all Did into worse and worse Confusion fall, He mix'd the Honest with the Cunning Part; And with great Secrecy and equal Art, Espous'd the Cause of his excluded Lord, And by the help of Providence restor'd The Royal Wand'rer to his Throne in Peace, And the wrong'd Kingdom to its Happiness. A wondrous Act, that did enough attone For all the Friendships he to Nol had shown! And by excess of Merit wash'd away The former Stains that on his Honour lay, Binding his Prince, by Nature kind and good, To turn Forgiveness into Gratitude, Who, by proud Titles and a large Supply Of Riches, rais'd the Gen'rous Worthy high; In great Affairs the trusty Chief imploy'd, And always call'd him Father till he di'd. He that for sake of Liberty or Bread, Does oblique Paths against his Conscience tread, Will, when Occasion offers, change his Course, To shew the World he stray'd with some remorse. A.D. 1660. The most Remarkable Transactions Of the Twelfth Year of the Reign of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1660. During these lucky Changes, which forerun The King's Redemption of his Royal Throne, His Majesty, who then at Brussels lay, Neglected nothing that might clear his way, But by the Trusty'st of his Friends took care Of all things needful in the Grand Affair; Sent Sir John. Greenvile o'er, a Man of Truth and Sence, In order to obtain a Conference With Gen'ral Monk; which, after some Delays, He gain'd, and manag'd wisely, to his Praise, Return'd with speed, in private, as requir'd, With such an Answer as the King desir'd; Who was, by Monk, precaution'd to remain No longer now within the Bounds of Spain; But, for his better Safety, make his Way From Brussels, to the Garison Breda, That otherwise His Majesty would be Detain'd by the Hispanian Ministry, Which, as it after did appear, had prov'd Too true, but that the King in time remov'd. Lambert, and other Officers of Note Haslerig, Axtel, Okey, Cleer, and Corbet the chief., Had put a new Commotion now on foot, And did with sev'ral Troops and Bands appear, Well arm'd at Dav'ntry in Northamptonshire: But, by the falseness of his Men was soon Subdu'd, and brought a Pris'ner up to Town By Ingoldsby and Streater Two Colonels., sent to crush The Malecontents, who would not stand one Push, But, without fighting, made themselves secure, By joining those who had the greatest Pow'r, That most of Lambert's Foot, as well as Horse, Surrender'd, or were Captives made by Force; Himself, with Col'nel Corbet, and some more, By the State-Council being sent to th'Tow'r. Thus fell that Rebel Lambert, who, like Nol, Expected to have gain'd the Sov'reign Rule. The new Free Parliament which long had been Desir'd, did their first Session now begin April 23., The Country having taken so much Care And Pains in their Election e'ery where, That few of the old Members could obtain Sufficient Int'rest to be chose again. Therefore, when thus the Commons were reform'd, And most Men with some Loyal Sparks were warm'd, The Gen'ral plainly found there now remain'd No Danger of the mighty Work in hand, But like a fearless Charioteer drove on, To win the Glorious Race he'd well begun, Receiv'd a new Commission from the King, Which Greenvile did, with sundry Letters, bring; And pompous, that no Poet's Tongue or Pen Can justly sing the Glories of the Train, Or Words improv'd by humane Art display The Gaudy Triumphs of that Joyful Day. Thus when the Saints had labour'd long in vain, To build a Babel from a ruin'd Reign, God with Confusion curs'd their sinful Ways, And spoil'd the lofty Tow'r they hop'd to raise; That when they'd waded through a crimson Flood Of Loyal, Innocent, and Royal Blood, Despair and Danger forc'd 'em to restore The Son, whose Father they'd destroy'd before. The End of the Twelfth Year. THE CHARACTER OF King Charles the Second. A Prince of Mercy, whose Majestick Mien Display'd the Goodness that was lodg'd within, Yet not a Cæsar in the Days of old, When mighty Men were proud of looking bold, Could boast a Warlike Aspect that appear'd More awful, worthy to be lov'd and fear'd. No Grecian Statue, carv'd with greatest Art, Could to the Eye such symetry impart, Or in its strenuous Limbs and Muscles shew A joint Proportion, more exactly true Than that which Nature's kind judicious Dame Projected in the Monarch's Royal Frame. To these, the outward Graces of a Prince, Were added, Piercing Wit and Pow'rful Sence, Compassion, Bounty, Tenderness of Blood, All that (excepting Chastity) were good: In that one Vertue we must own he fail'd, Tho' in so many others he excel'd. But if we look upon his Vice, that reigns So oft in Courts, with all its Circumstance, It must oblige Good-Nature to forbear His Failings, which indeed too Publick were, And by the bad Example which he show'd, Made Carnal Sports become too much a Mode. But had his Consort as Prolifick prov'd As other Ladies whom the Monarch lov'd, We might have ballanc'd, with a Lawful Race Of Princely Sons, the number of the Base; Such as hereafter might have fill'd the Throne, Instead of Strangers, to the Land unknown. But 'twas a Blessing which the Royal Bride, As 'twas ordain'd by Providence, deny'd To a Rebellious Faction, who'd undone The Father and pursu'd the Royal Son. But his discerning Eyes discover'd all Their Plots intended to effect his Fall, And turn'd their Mischiefs on the daring Head Of him by whom their ill Designs were laid; Pull'd down with ease what they with danger built, And still preserv'd the Pow'r to punish Guilt, Altho' his Mercy oft usurp'd the place Of Justice, due to an offending Race, And only curb'd their Malice when he saw 'Twas needful to exert the Fangs of Law, Lest Publick Safety might endanger'd be, By too much Mildness and Impunity. So prudent Parents exercise the Rod, Less for their own than for their Childrens good. No Prince, in Times so difficult as those, Wherein he reign'd beset with Factious Foes, Could with more Temper Rule a troubl'd Throne, Or bear the Burthen of the English Crown With such a chearful Mind that fearless stood The Shock of e'ery threatning Storm that blow'd, And from uneasy Apprehensions free, Enjoy'd an undisturb'd Tranquility; As if his penetrating Eyes descry'd The Workings of their sly malicious Pride, Discern'd the Threads that thro' their Projects run, And cut 'em still as fast as they were spun; 'Twixt Scylla and Caribdis safely steer'd, And neither Pope or Presbyterian fear'd: But found, in spite of all their plotting Schemes, A happy Medium 'twixt the two Extreams. No Wars, except the Dutch, and those were short, Eclips'd the peaceful Splendor of his Court: No want of Trade to make the Poor complain: No gauling Tax in his auspicious Reign, But that oppressive Trifle which the Saints Made the chief Cause of all their loud Complaints. In short, no thankless Kingdom could possess More happy Days, and yet enjoy 'em less: For surfeited with Wealth and cloy'd with Ease, They slighted all the heavenly Fruits of Peace; And lab'ring at those Changes they have since Compleated, lost the Blessings of a Prince, Whose Reign, Obedience would have made alone The Golden Age, if ever such were known.
