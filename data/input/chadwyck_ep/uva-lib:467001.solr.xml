      <field name="fulltext">THE STORY OF QUEEN ISABEL. In the grey halls of Hugh de Lusignan Dwelt Princess Isabel, too wild a bird For such a cage, for she was scarce fifteen; Life quiver'd like a rosebud in her hand, Showing the bloom and fragrance at its heart Through films of beauty, not as yet withdrawn, Waiting a warmer touch. She was betroth'd To Hugh, and by the manner of the time Bred in his house, that she might learn his ways, Make her smooth brow a mirror for his smile, And practise, ere she vow'd, a wife's submission. Wives should have grown all perfect by such practice. Perhaps they wearied in the exercise, Like children only train'd by scales and chords, Who, grown, fling by their music as a task, The secrets of its glory still unlearn'd. She flutter'd through the household like a breeze That brings a blossom down at every breath, And makes an order'd walk impossible; The strong tree feels it stir about his heart, And moves his stately arms to hold it fast, But it flits on, to ruffle some lone pool Or dust a swallow's wing. Under the curve Of the dark portal, on his steed, Sir Hugh Sate like a picture, half his calm face light, Half shadow, framed in azure sheens of steel, And crown'd with plumes that scarcely moved, he sate So still; but in his eyes the shadow fix'd, And seem'd the symbol of an inward gloom; For he had pour'd his heart in one farewell, Going to war, and on its flood a frost Had fallenâI know not howâa look, a tone, A touch, a silenceâlife is full of such, Full till it overflows, and drops itself At last into the tranquil depths of death. You would have wonder'd at his face, it seem'd Too grand to be so troubled; but a rock, Scorning the strokes of ocean, will grow dark Under the passage of an April cloud, And such a cloud was on his spirit now. It pass'd. What wrought the change? It could not be This spray of myrtle striking on his breast, Blown by the wind, or toss'd from some gay hand Which closed the lattice as the flower came down, And, closing, hid a flash of smiles? What spell Is in the blossom, that he takes it up, Talks to it with the rapture of his eyes, Kisses it like a relic, and receives Life, grace, hope, pardon from the kiss? Ask not! Nor let him ask! But let him ride away, And let it lie as softly on his heart As the first breath of some delicious hope Long look'd for, oft refused, coming at last, And hail'd almost with pain! Yes, let him go, And feed and fill the passion of his soul With thoughts which answer to his own, and eyes Which speak his language, and dream-histories Most strong and subtle in their linkÃ¨d proofs; Making it clear that what he saw was false, And what he dreams is true for evermore. And Isabel, who threw the flower, and shut The casement, and stood still, nor once look'd forth To watch the parting hero, shook her curls, And laugh'd, and told her image in the glass It was a fault to be so beautiful. Her maid had told her so, and, sooth to say, If such a fault there be, she was most guilty; For, not the glory of her face, the mould Like some young sister of Antinous, The deep eyes, whose capacity for tears Life had not tested yet, the perfect lips Made for soul-utterance, when the soul should wake, Not these alone, but something more than these Bewilder'd and enchain'd you when she moved, Making you think that all things fair on earth, All woodland vaults, and mountain solitudes, All sunset grandeurs, and all morning blooms, Were meant as frames and backgrounds for her form, And, till she took her place, were not complete. She stood and listen'd, arching one small hand About her ear, like some most delicate shell, And smiling, as she gather'd in the sounds Not of those parting footsteps. âO! Isaure, Think you he cometh?â And Isaure replied, âHow could he choose but come?â âI do not knowâ Was it a fault to answer when he spoke? I could not help it, if it was a fault.â âNay, sweetest lady,â quoth the false Isaure, â'Twas simple courtesy. I never saw, Not I, such reverence as his. He seem'd To think you born a queen. He would not chide The lovely starts and freedoms of your youth With that relentless pertinacious frown Which marks you as a slave whene'er you speak. Did you not see his rapture when you smiled?â Hanging her head, she answer'd, âNoâI think I should not know himâI scarce saw his face.â âHow? Not his great black eyes?â âBlack eyes,â she cried, Lifting an angry brow; âGirl, they were blue! Blue as these sapphires on my wrist!â But here A glance shot past her from the false Isaure, Which clearly met its answer. Isabel, With a faint outcry, like a frighten'd bird, Dropp'd on her knees, dared not look round, but crouch'd As if to hide herself beneath her hair, And spread her hands before her faceâweak fence, Soon sever'd! One strong finger broke it down, And, gather'd in the grasp of him who stoop'd Above her, and uplifted her, she seem'd, Indeed, a little fluttering frighten'd dove In a hawk's clutch. But this triumphant hawk Could sing as sweetly as a nightingale To charm his willing prey. He was a man In the fresh noon of life, large-limb'd and tall, Broad-brow'd and statelyâwith imperial eyesâ He had them from the old Plantagenets, And had not so misused the legacy As quite to mar it yetâthough nought was left But a king's semblance masking a churl's heart. Poor Isabel, who worshipp'd what she saw, Child Isabel, who saw but what she worshipp'd, Now, trembling at his touch, but not with fear, Murmur'd proud words, and thought she conquer'd him When he drew back abash'd. She could not trace The subtle smile in his accustom'd eyes, And, in his homage, she forgave herself For overboldness, as he knew she would. Then came the common tale,ââI die without thee, And death is better than to live without thee!â âAh goâI must not listen!â âThen farewell; Nor sight nor hearing shall offend thee more, But grant my grave a tear!â Fast come the tears; So fast, he needs must stay to wipe them off. And then strong wordsââA crown is at thy feet! Speak, and I set it on thy brow!â And thenâ Why linger on the way? The end is known! Pledged by each weak reluctance, she resists Only to yield. âIt is impossible!â âNay, nay, my love, the steeds are at the door.â âI could not go alone.â âIsaure is here.â (Fond false Isaure would guard her through the world.) âBut how disguised?â And while she speaks, the folds Are wrapp'd around her. So a life is lost! Her foot is on the downward slope of doom, Exulting, weeping, confident, afraid, She trustsâshe venturesâshe is at the foot! And so Prince John of England steals his bride. O, Isabel! one throb of that true heart Which heaves in hope beneath thy myrtle spray Is more than this man's life. Thou know'st it not. We seldom know the worth of what we lose Till we have lost it; but that man is blest Who from the desolate caverns of the night Looks back to the far morning, and beholds A flower which died upon his heart, and not A star which only pass'd before his face. There are such things as empty lives, and these Are drearier than full tombs. A day and night They rode together, each swift hour more rich In tender thought and wonder than the last; Her dreams had all been vague; and now she dream'd This bright reality should teach her all. For she knew nothingâjudged notâbut received. He smiled, and âSo,â she thought, âa hero smiles.â He spoke, she listen'd greedily, to learn The way in which a model knight made love; He swore a little when his courser tripp'd, And âThis,â she thought, âis done by angry kings, I must not heed it.â So she question'd not, Miss'd not, expected not, but still received; Till once his bold eyes burn'd upon her face So fiercely, that she shrank and dropp'd her veil, And trembled inwardly a little while, Then to herself said, chiding, âThis is love. I have been told I am too young for love; When I am older, I shall bear it better; But I am not too young to wear a crown, And be a prince's bride.â So they rode on, And came to Chaluz, to the English camp,â A town of tents, wrapt round about a fort, Like a white turban round a swarthy brow. âAnd here,â so said the prince, âKing Richard lay, That warrior of the world, who never slept, Sieging and storming Chaluz for his pastime. And here the prince would bring his lovely bride, And give her to his sister-queen, to keep Till Chaluz fell, and they could wed in peace.â All this was true. (When John of England spake, Full seldom could men say, âAll this is true.â) But Isabel was royal; unbetroth'd, He might have woo'd her in the face of day; He dared not wrong her. His unknightly heart, (Cold, mean, and scanty, as a pauper's dole,) Knew one deep fireâbesides the hunger-fit, Which he call'd love till it was satisfied, And then call'd nothing!âone deep quenchless fire,â Hatred and scorn for noble Lusignan. Judge no man by his love; 'tis oft a shape So mantled in his hopes, he cannot see it For what it is; but judge him by his hate: If he shrink back from generous souls, and find Specks in the sun, and stains upon the snow; If great deeds warm him not, and stirring words, Words that are weapons, only arm his heart With unbelief, condemn him! He is dark, He hates the light because his deeds are evil, He is impure, and cannot look on God. They came to Chaluz as the twilight fell, And found a stir and tumult in the camp, But not of battle, and a noise of tears, (Strange music stealing through those banner'd lines), And such a wan array of soldier-faces, Wide-eyed, mute, mournful, wheresoe'er they moved, That it appall'd them like a spectral host New-ris'n by moonlight, and the prince's voice Stopp'd in his throat. But lo! one caught his rein With, âPrince, the king is dying!â and another Cried, âKing that is to be, in one short hour, Remember that I hail'd you first as king.â He, trembling, from his horse, and scarce aware Of the slight form that flutter'd to his side, (His gather'd rose forgotten, when the blast Once touch'd himself), went onward to the tent, And in, she still beside him. Afterward The knights remember'd they had seen her there, And marvell'd why they marvell'd not; they felt Such palsy of amazement and distress, That, as a cup receives wine, milk, oil, poison, And holds them all alike, and has no sense Of difference among them, so their eyes Perceived all objects, and distinguish'd none, None save that grand still face, from which the cloud Of life was slowly passing, to reveal Light never seen till now. In the tent-door Stood Isabel, and saw the dying king. He, on his couch, an arrow in his breast, Kept down his pain as though it were his foe, And gazed, unshaken, in the eyes of Death. She heard him speak. There stood an archer bound, At his bed-foot, defiant, in the gripe Of men whose faces thirsted for his blood, Scarce able to restrain themselves, and wait His sentence; this was he who slew the king; And the king spoke his doom. âTake him away, And set him free, I freely pardon him.â They dragg'd him forth. Then was the place made calm Except for grief; and the king smiled, and waved His strong hand feebly, and, with steady voice, Slow dying into silence like a horn, Said: âFarewell, England! farewell, all my knights! Remember me in battle, as a man Who never turn'd his back, nor broke his faith, Nor fail'd to spare the weak. I have not shaped A Law to keep my name for after-times, As on a throne, above the minds of men; But Man is more than Law, and I may leave Some impress of myself upon the world, One poor brief life, helping to feed the flame Of chivalry, and keep alive the truth That courage, honour, mercy, make a knight.â Here paused the stately sound, and then resumed More softly: âDo not weep. O, die with me, But do not hold me back! I cannot die With all this weight of tears about my heart.â And low sobs answer'd through the stillness, yet You could not see who wept. Then stretch'd the king His arms, and cried: âI see, I see a Cross Beneath the palms. O, weary waste of sand! O, Cross, my home! let me lie down and sleep At Thy dear foot, and dream of deeds to come, Forgetting all the feeble, sinful past! Father, forgive me! Is my brother there? Let some one tell him to be true to England. Where is my sword? This trumpet in mine ears, So far, so faint, is yet a call to warâ To horse! To horse!â Erect he sate, and shook His sword, cried: âGod for England!â and was dead. Then from the floor a woman rose, and stood A moment, swaying, like a wind-swept reed, And stared upon the corpse, and touch'd its hand With passionate lips, and groan'd, and moved away, While the knights murmur'd: âPassage for the queen.â Out of the tent she pass'd, her garments brush'd By Isabel, and, while a heart beats ten, The two stood face to face, as if i' the west The grief and darkness of a night of storms Fronted the morning's joy. Another dawn Glisten'd in Isabel's unconscious eyes, For she had look'd upon a great man's death, And she was changed. There is a day in Spring When under all the earth the secret germs Begin to stir and glow before they bud; The wealth and festal pomps of Midsummer Lie in the heart of that inglorious day, Which no man names with blessing, though its work Is blest by all the world. Such days there are In the slow story of the growth of souls, And such a day was this for Isabel. Then came a time of tumult. Knight by knight To their new lord did homage; jubilee Blent strangely with the sights and sounds of woe, As if some scoffer play'd a light lavolte To mock a funeral. Not an hour stay'd John Beside his brother's couch; with shaking hands He took the proffer'd crown; and with white lips, Widening in shallow laughter, mutter'd words Of welcome to his vassals' fealty. She who stood near him thought his heart was moved By some strong shock of crossing waves, which meet And shatter into trifles of mere spray. It was not so. His was a coward soul, Afraid of all but pleasure; shuddering At life, or death, or greatness, or repose; He made her sit beside him, and rejoiced To read the wonder of her loveliness In the first glance and start of all who came; He made them kiss her hand, and for an hour Revell'd in sufferance of such petty homage, Like one who shows a priceless gem, that men May covet it; then in a sudden wrath He snatch'd her fingers from the lip of one Who knelt, and toss'd them from him with an oath Hard as a blow, and sent her to her maids. Yet when he saw her next, he knew so well To speak of passion and of reverence, To turn his anger on the knight, whose lips Were something over-busy with her hand, That her proud heart, bewilder'd but appeased, Misdeem'd him still her lover, and forgave The natural, noble jealousies of love. O, new to love and life! thine ignorance Melts slowly into knowledge; twice perhaps Thou mayst be cheated with a lieâaye, thriceâ Not oftener; thou shalt stretch thy hand to feel For the quick pulses of a fellow-heart, And find a blank, and know thyself deceived. The Queen, a four-days wife, and panting still Up to her neck in splendours, sate enthroned Her lord beside her, on a gala day, To see the people come, and goâand smile Like a mere goddess o'er the human scene. Her girlish thoughts were lower than her throne, Playing, like children, on the swarded slopes, Hiding in leafy nests, or dancing forth Like May-flies on quick waters; but the crown Which girt her brow, was scarce a stronger ring Than that wherewith her pride had fenced her youth, And she sate still, in patient stateliness. There came a herald to the presence, sent She knew not whence, but something in his face, Lifted from due obeisance, as he look'd Into her careless eyes before he spoke, Hath made her start and blush. Yet in that look No insult lurk'd; it seem'd a mute appeal, Like a true hound inquiring for his master. Three times a horn was winded, then he spoke:â âJohn, King of England, listen to my voice. The noble Marcher, Hugh de Lusignan, Hath sent me here to challenge and defy thee, And scorn thee for a caitiff, to the face; For that thou didst, not openly by daylight, But with base subterfuge and craft unknightly, Steal a great treasure from him, which to name He thinks unseemly; but for which he lived, And is prepared to die. There lies his gage! At any hour, in any place, by day Or night, in France or England, he will meet thee, And prove his words upon thy recreant body.â He drew his clashing gauntlet off, and paused As if about to hurl it at the king, Who shrank and raised his hand. The herald laugh'd, And flung it at his feet. King John, being safe, Sneer'd as he answer'd,ââGo, and tell thy lord That if he is so lavish of his blood, I will appoint a man to fight with him, He is too small for me. Let the glove lie.â This to his knights, who all had drawn their swords, And were contending which should lift the glove, After the English manner; knowing not The cause of strife, but eager to be in it. Thus curb'd, they follow him with frowning eyes And fingers restless at their hilts; but he Cried, âNow to tennis!â and broke up the court As lightly as a maid. The queen stood still Like one who hath been struck, who knows not yet Where is the blow, or what the pain, but feels A certain chillness in the heart and brain, As if life paused a little while and doubted Whether it should resume its course. But then, As a branch stoops with over-weight of snow, Lets down its burden, and starts back again Noiselessly and unwounded to its place, She dropp'd the cold oppression from her heart, And rose, and seem'd unscathed. The herald faced her, Reading her with his eyes, they two alone, Till, like a whirlwind, sprang the wrathful king Back to her side, and caught her by the wrist, With, âMadam, came this messenger for you? What? Will you shame me here before my court? Hence! to your chamber!â Not a step she moved, But, when he loosed his grasp, she laid her hands Upon his breast, and pierced him with her eyes, And whisper'd, âShall men say you were afraid?â âWhy, aye, my love, they must an if they list,â He answer'd lightly, in a heartless jest Quenching his ire. âAnd if you want a hero, You should have stay'd beside the Marcher Hugh, Who hath a gift that way. He does not risk So great a kingdom and so fair a wife, And can be valiant at a cheaper rate.â Mocking, he went. Her maidens gather'd round To lead her in, but with a cry, she cast Her face upon the bosom of Isaure; A cry, as of a woman robb'd and wrong'd Who knows her rage is helpless, and consents To her despair. Not undeceived at once Do hearts give up their idols; many shifts They try to cheat themselves; and, of repulsed, Creep back like beaten slaves. Blank wonder first, Then unbelief and obstinate confusion; Then, shock by shock, resisted horror came Slowly, with many an after-thought of how And why the vileness was not what it seem'd, And hers the blunder, but not his the shame. But in a year the lesson was complete; Henceforth the lustre of her youth and crown Shone on a widow's brow for evermore. Yet, half a child, she found a foolish charm In gems and unfamiliar gauds of state, And the mere marvel of her loveliness; Or drugg'd herself with pleasure, till she saw Only unreal shapes and fantasies, And, for a space, forgot the Facts of life. In such brief intervals her anguish slept, Then sprang on her refresh'd. Meantime, her heart Kept still an inner chamber, whose barr'd door She dared not open, but within there dwelt A Memory and a Name. As piece by piece, And hue by hue, the glories and the gifts Wherewith her blind belief had robed the King Were rent away, they pass'd within that door, And gather'd round that Name and Memory, And were in their own place. She knew them there, But tried to keep the secret from herself, And would not look upon them. This dark year Was spent in England, where the people loved To look on her great beauty, and believed She must be happy, being born in France, And yet so blest as to be Queen of England. They served her with a blunter courtesy Than her own race, yet would have died for her Under less challenge. Shrinkingly she felt The keenness of their island atmosphere, Where every deed must bear the test of scorn, Ere it have leave to call itself a deed; And marvell'd at achievements, where attempts Were so discouraged. Such a discipline Makes greatness surly, so inured to strife, That scarcely is it capable of peace; But such a discipline makes greatness strong. Under its knife the weaker buds fall off And perish, while the central stem is left Bare, but gigantic. When the year was gone, The king went back to France. A blacker time Drew nigh; we need not tell in English ears The story of Prince Arthur. Day by day Heard Isabel how Hugh de Lusignan Was as a sword in royal Arthur's hand, And in his breast a soul; the noise of fame Filling the general ear, had still for her His accents, and she knew his master-touch In each great deed, each page of chivalry,â Fresh wreaths to fling before that secret shrine, From which she turn'd away her face. At last One drop of old Plantagenet was found Lurking in John's cold veins, and his heart beat, For just a moment, with the lion-pulse Of his dead brother. England answer'd it, And, with a bound, brought down the foe. The queen Heard in her bower at Rouen, and went forth With thoughts unspoken burning on her cheeks To greet the victor, who, exhausted, came From his first conquest, bringing in his train One captive, stately in his first defeat. A three weeks' royal progress through the land They went, with palfreys and with pursuivants; Free banners waved, and clarions spake to lutes, And silken splendours made the winding roads Rivers of gems and flowers. Each morn the queen Did poise the airy grandeur of her shape On a new steed; the wayside seem'd all eyes, The wind all acclamation. Proud she sate, And with a forward gaze that never swerved, Greeted the crowds to come, but scarcely seem'd To see them when they pass'd. Behind her rode A great array of cavaliers and dames, And after them the captives, two and two, Chain'd in vile tumbrils, twenty gallant knights To swell the pomp, and show the doubting world That even King John had won a battle once. Bareheaded, in their stain'd and batter'd mail, Ashamed, as beaten soldiers are ashamed, Haggard with wrath, and hunger, and disdain, Each man of them look'd twice as much a king As their soft captor. Never saw the queen A face among them, for she fear'd too much To see the face of One; but evermore A dream of pallid heroes vex'd her soul; Till, having sigh'd through many restless nights, She could endure no more, but suddenly Wroth that her asking eyes had no response, Cried, âHave you seen him?â to fond false Isaure, Who knew her drift, but would not seem to know it, Dreading the end, and so made doubtful answer: âSeen whom? The king?â Girl Isabel, abash'd, Turn'd from her and was dumb. Your foot may quench A feeble flame; but if the flame be strong, Trodden, it starts anew. For two days more The trouble smoulder'd, then broke out again. The page who led her palfrey (one more Spring Had touch'd his brow than hers), who worshipp'd her With tender desperation, like a boy, Seeking no guerdon but a smile, and dying In fancy for that guerdon thrice a day, Mark'd every flush that cross'd her fading cheek, And silently beset her as she went With ceaseless proffers of himself. At last, She bade him fetch a cup of wine, and he Giving it, breathless, to her hand, was brought Close to her, and could feel the faintest air That pass'd her lips; then she, who did not know She was about to speak till she had spoken, Said, âWould the captive knights were so refresh'd!â And put the goblet from her with a sigh. Then for a week he walk'd beside her rein With tidings in his face, but never spoke, Until he heard her jesting with her maids, Saying, she prized a book above a friend, Because it talk'd to her when she was mute; âBut a queen's friend,â she said, âis ever mute Till the queen talks.â When next he lifted her Upon her steed, he said, âThey thank your Grace For daily benefits.â The colour rush'd Out of her face. That white and speechless answer Was all she gave; and through that summer's day She look'd not on him once. Next morn, her hand Trembled a little on his arm; he felt, And answer'd, âTis your mercy spares their lives; For wounds, and weariness, and scanty food Were slaying them before.â Too young she was To keep her marble majesty unmoved, And at these words she wept. 'Twas well for him The king rode up just then. A moment more, And his mad pity had betray'd them both. Thenceforward, duly with the morn, he spoke. Like a wild deer, which, being tamed, looks first And flies, then looks and lingers, and at last Looks and draws near, she learn'd to meet his eyes And bear them, and at last respond to them; A glance, a tear of thanks, a word of ruth, No more; nor ever pass'd a name her lips Nor hisâhe ignorant, and she afraid. He, counting all for common tenderness Of natural pity, pour'd alike on all; She, owning nought but pity to herself, Not owning that she pitied all for one. And thus again to England, whose white cliffs Seem'd once like bridal draperies, but now Merely like shrouds of death. The captives went To their own places; to their separate glooms, Uncheer'd by glance, or hand, or hope; to brood On those impossible glories of the past, When they might touch the grass, and see the sky, And do the work of men. But manly work Is sometimes in a prison, where no fault Has cast a great one, for his greatness smitten; Where his calm eyes, not troubled by mere pain, Look through a past so glorious and so pure, That, crown'd by its undying light, he seems To wear his sorrow like a monarch's robe. There shall the love of nations cleave to him, And men shall watch his prison as they watch A beacon in the tempest, teaching them By its true fire, the way that they should go. His name shall be the trophy of his age, When one man lived who lived not for himself, But only for his country. On the queen Great darkness settled. First, the common air Groan'd with the death of Arthur. No man told The news before her, but it came to her Silently, like a breath of pestilence, Sapping her life. She ask'd not, but she knew How it befell; and shudder'd when she took Her place beside her lord, and ever dream'd, Through all the senseless splendours of her court, Of lonely cells, to which that news must come, Breaking brave hearts. Then tardily came up Vague notes of scatter'd sorrow from those cells, And here and there she heard how one was dead, Dying of grief, or want, or solitude, Men said not which. As one who walks the shore After a tempest, where a wreck hath been, And knows that one he loved was in the ship, And sees the blind sea cast her corpses up, And dares not lift the tangle from the face Lest he should see the face he fears to see; But lingers near, until some passer says, By such a sign, or such, it is not he, Then to the next goes, tremblingâso she heard Each death; and, fearing till she heard the name, Pass'd on to a new fear. At last her heart Gave way within her, and she sought a place To weep, and there she communed with herself. âShall this go on for ever? Can a child (I was no more) have leave to bar itself From all fair heritage of life? My youth Lies spread before me like a desert. There I must walk on until I meet with death, And never stay my feet nor slake my thirst, Nor look a moment in the face of hopeâ And yet I had it!âAh! woe's me, I had it, And flung it from me! Can a worse sin be Than scorn and loathing in the place of love? Is it not sin to live so join'd to sin You needs must drink its breath? Aye, tis pollution! God's law not kept for fear it should be broken, Once boldly broken, may be kept for ever; And liberty, and love, and heavenly peace, Make Eden in my heart. To save a lifeâ Why, that's plain virtue! I can save two lives; One from the prison and the tomb, and one From a worse prison and a deeper tomb, And the slow shame of everlasting chains. A name withholds meâbut the name shall break, And let me through to bliss!â Word rush'd on word, Like troops that storm a breach. The breach was storm'd. There is but little swiftness in the world; A good deed lags, and loses half its grace By being long'd for. But this sudden thought Went like a shaft of passion to its aim, Nor swerved nor falter'd, when the string was loosed. Much favour'd her. The king was gone. Few guards Cumber'd the summer palace where she dwelt, And these loved her, loathed him, and would have kept Her secret, had she told it. What they guess'd They told not to each other. So she went Unquestion'd through the twilight, and appear'd Like a new star before that faithful page, Who served her still; stood close, and spake to him:â âGet me a page's dress and two good steeds; That to my chamber, these beneath yon walls To wait my bidding!â Speaking, she was gone. He dazzled, but not doubting, did her hest, And with the steeds kept watch beneath the moon, His pacing steps as patient as his heart. At night a boy sprang down the palace stair, Out on the pale grass where the moonlight moves, And shot into the darkness of the trees, Fearing his shadow like a stranger. On He crept, and paused beside the prison walls, And scared the soldier with a shower of gems, Crying, âTake these, and fly.â Among the dew They lay, and mock'd but could not match its lustre; Aghast, the man stoop'd down to gather them, Nor touch'd the bounteous vision, who pass'd by, Under the portal, up the vaulted gloom, Even to the hopeless dungeon door, so barr'd It scarcely seem'd to need its sentinel. Here flash'd a ruby through the lamp's dim light; âTake this, and fly, and leave thy keys with me.â A pause show'd doubtâand then a diamond fell Worth a king's ransom. âNay, fear nothing, friend! Go and be rich. The keys!â What sudden worlds Of rest and splendour bribe the weary slave From his hired faith! With weaker waves, perhaps, He might have foughtâthis torrent sweeps him downâ Yet some rough conscience made him wait to lift The massy bars; then ruefully, like one Who never thought to come to such a pass, But has no choice, he shakes his shaggy head, And turns to grasp his fortune. Through the door Went Isabel, and drew her page's cloak Around her, and trod softly, and stood still, Shrinking and shaking in the prison twilight; Till, as her guarded and luxurious eyes, Not with such shades familiar, by degrees Learn'd a new power of sight, she was aware Of reeking walls unwindow'd, rusty chains Broken, and in the grey gloom farther off A quiet man asleep upon the floor. How quiet! can this be death? She draws more near, Scarce breathing. No! the slumber of a child. She grasps her fiery heart and holds it down; âO, couldst thou beat as softly!â On his face, Bare to the lamp, a little worn and pale, The habit of heroic thought was fix'd, And could not be misread. It spake to her With such a revelation in its speech That she beheld herself for what she was, And what she should have been. Ah, pity her, Not him; shame strikes her downâshe kneelsâshe fallsâ And stifles all her sobs against the ground. Gives but a moment to her swift remorse, And grudges thatâunworthy even to breathe The air his presence purifies. She prays That if he grace her with a passing thought, He may believe her virtuous, and not dream How base a hope beguiled her. Was it hope? Now seems it on the other side o' the earth, Farther and worse than death. But there is work To do for him; that comfort she may take To bind about the torture of her lifeâ A little dew upon a burning wound. She dares not touch him: when she fits the key Into his chain she blushes; when he wakes She is about to fly; but stops herself, And stands before him like a criminal Without a voice. He rose and stretch'd his hand For the familiar hilt, then smiled to think How slow he was to learn that it was gone; The loosen'd fetters, dropping as he rose, Rang on the stone; below the flickering lamp Stood a pale stripling in a page's cloak; The door was openâwith a stride that smack'd Of freedom, he has reach'd itâthen he turn'd And his eye rested on the cowering boy, And, half ashamed of strange discourtesy, He said, âA captive soon forgets his manners; Pardon, I pray you. What's your will with me?â âOnly to set you free.â The murmur came Feebly through folded hands, and, when he moved Nearer, the hands were raised. âNay, fear me not,â He said, with that majestic gentleness Which was his way. âIf you would hide your face I will not try to see it. Let me thank you. I think I feel a breeze upon my cheek Not from these charnel vaults; a breeze that brings Some message from the forests. I am free. I never was a captive. I take up My freedom where I left it, and efface The fever-dream, and wake. Is it for pity That I must thank you?â âBy the western tower,â She answer'd, seeming not to heed his words, âYour steed awaits you.â Secretly she thought, âO! when he finds two steeds will he discern My purpose, and disdain me?â âThanks again,â He said, âbut must I take no name with me For blessing in my prayers?â At this a wish Heaved in her troubled breast, and forced its way. âIt was the Queen,â she said, âwho sent me here.â Then such a sudden light of tenderness Fill'd all his face, and glisten'd in his eyes, That she, resisting this, felt she was made More worthy of him, and was comforted. He did not speak at first, and then she saw A little cloud of unresented wrongs Pass over that pure light, and then he spoke; âMy homage and deep thanks attend the Queen, That of her mercy she remember'd me.â He turn'd to go, and she stood still, in soul Clasping his knees for pardon. Once again He spoke, now trembling. âBoy, you serve the Queen; I would,âI would I knew that she was happy.â Here that undying woman-pride which fights In noble natures to the last, and falls Veiling its face from him who strikes it down, That fault, which hath the form and force of virtue, Sprang up in her and spoke. âShe hath her choice, She must be happy.â And they parted so. The King came back to find his captive fled, And his rage baffled by wild tales of ghosts Who broke the dungeon doors, and loosed the chains, And stood, disguised as pages, under walls Holding swift horses. If he guess'd the truth He show'd it not, though in his eyes there lurk'd Strange subtle lights whene'er that trusty page Led the Queen's steed. He kept his vengeance cold Till it was wanted. He was busy, too, With a new love, and hardly graced his wife With such poor homage as concealment pays. But into Isabel's deserted life Had come a burst of sunshine, and the waste Shone with a mirage. All her griefs forgot, Her faults self-pardon'd, and her wrongs unfelt, Watching two little tender veils lift up From two soft violet-buds. O! new-born eyes! Through you the mother sees awhile, and loses Her proper vision. Vague and beautiful The sweet world shines on her as on her babe, And she remembers in it nothing wrong, Sees nothing sorrowful. The day must come When wrong and sorrow shall be multiplied By myriad terrors; her bare heart the shield To keep those eyes from once beholding them. Three years she kept her treasureâa girl-babe, Unwelcome, yet belovedâthree peaceful years Snatch'd from the course of tumult, like a nook Of quiet water in a rushing stream, Where foam-bells drift and cluster, while the waves Eddy around and break below, yet leave The little nest inviolate. Meantime The gradual strength of England built itself Into a tower for ever; and the day Drew on, when feeble tyranny should fall Against that tower and break. But this, not yet. The King in dalliance steep'd his soul, and left His wife and people to their separate works; One only murmur cross'd the Queen's calm life And touch'd her cloister'd heart with pangs of joy; That the late captive, taking back to him The lordship of his valour, had achieved New greatness, and had join'd himself in peace To England, doing service for the King. âWas this for me?â she thought, then hid her eyes In her babe's bosom, leaving there the thought. Among her maids she work'd, when sudden feet Rang all along the stairs, the doors gaped wide, And, with a train of state, unheralded, The King strode in. No prouder thing on earth Was seen than her humility. She rose For due obeisance, and her cheek was stone When his lips laugh'd against it. There he stood, And something in his smile was terrible, Like slow fulfilment of a doom. The child Slept near; she stood before it, and put back A hurried hand, and hid it with a scarf, As if unconscious. Smiling still, he spoke, âMadam, your daughter is betroth'd to-day. The Marcher, Hugh de Lusignan, hath woo'd her, And got her for his wife, with my consent; And, as you know of old, it is his fashion To train his wives, he hath demanded her, And she must go to him across the seas. Joy to his work, and patience; he will be A sober bridegroom, when she's fit to wed. Will you not wish them joy? She sails to-night.â She clung about his knees and kiss'd his feet, Suing him like a god; his silence seem'd Like mercy to herâit was only triumph. This prostrate passion of her vain despair Was what he sought. It is not good to look Upon her anguish. When her swoon was past, And past some weeks of fever, she rose up To stagger faintly through the blank of life, Blind, wistful, hopeless; ever in her heart, A dumb reproach, and in her eyes a loss, And in her voice a secresy of tears. She ask'd, as once before, âWas this for me?â And thought the vengeance hard, but had not strength To plead against it, even with herself. And still she sigh'd when other babes were given To love but not to joy. They seem'd like ghosts, And every movement scared her with remembrance. She could not love another like the first, Which open'd all the softness of her heart. On stole the sombre years. The people saw Her proud, fair face, and knew not what it mask'd; Sometimes she graced the court beside her lord, And sometimes dwelt in private; either way Alike to her; she did as she was told. One little draught of pity at her lips She did not spurn, but drank, and was refresh'd. The page, now grown a knight, and faithful still, Still claiming nothing but the leave to love, Was near her daily, and encounter'd her With such poor comfort as his truth could give. The King look'd on and was content. At last There went a poisonous whisper through the land, And dogged men, who scorn'd their caitiff lord, Thought still his wife was bound to honour him; And she, who guess'd not why they scowl'd at her, Found greater comfort in the only eyes That met her kindly; so the whisper grew; And when the deadly fruit was ripe, it fell. One summer's day she rode to join the King At his new palace, where he summon'd her; And, wearily dismounting, to resume The chains a little while laid by, she read Such truth and pity in those loyal eyes, That her stray hand fell lightly on his brow Bent to her stirrup, and she spake and sigh'd,â âFriend, pray for me, I need it!â All in tears He turn'd away; and she, with tears, went in; Watch'd from a window by her lord, who show'd The gesture to his train, and bade them mark; Then greeted her so gaily, that she knew He had some bitter purpose in his soul. Beside her at the banquet, still he show'd Unwonted homage, but her shuddering looks Could nowhere find a substance for their fear; (She noted not the absence of her knight.) She waited till the long carouse was done, Then, at his signal, rose. âYour cheeks are pale, My queen,â he said, âsleep must their springtide prove, To make them bloom anew. Give me your hand. I'll see you to your chamber.â So they went Together, with a train to marshall them. The chamber was a blaze of light; the King Stood still a moment by the curtain'd couch, Holding her hand, and looking in her face, As a wolf eyes the fawn before he springs, Then dropp'd her hand, and drew the curtain back, And hiss'd into her ear, âYour rest be soft!â âThis is no bed; it is an open tomb. Upon the pillow lies the dumb despair Of a familiar face without a soul, A loyal breast, uncover'd and transfix'd, And under the close dagger-hilt a stain Slow spreading while they gazed. The Queen knelt down Without a cry; kiss'd the wan brow, and said, âO! my one friend, slain only for my love, Happier than I, whom hate disdains to slay, I will be true to thee as thou to me. True, for thy living homage dared no more, Than thy dead hand, to harm me. Fare thee well. Be glad that thou hast served me in thy death, Setting me free; for, henceforth, never more Will I be made a pageant; never more Shall this my spousal crown, defiled with blood, Press my poor brows; and when my place is void, Thy murderer shall not dare to ask the cause. It is for me a kind of liberty To seem henceforth the hapless thing I am, And, in the prison of my private grief, Weep for my child, and thee, and one besides.â Forth with these words she went; the men stood by, To let her pass; the women knelt and wept; For the last act of such a tragedy Was in her face, they could not choose but weep. It seem'd as if the curtains of her heart Were lifted, like the curtains of that couch, To show a corpse. The very king himself Trembled, and turn'd away his eyes in fear. Henceforward, as she said, she dwelt apart; And some believed she was a faithless wife, Judged by her conscience, left unscathed for ruth; Some knew her wrongs, and faintly pitied her As men will pity woes they cannot help, Desiring to forget them. Solitude Gave her no comfort, only gave her time For the slow, fruitless fever of regret To prey upon her life; such grief as her's Is never soften'd; flowers that grace a grave Die in the hot air of a sick man's room, Where fear and hope and longing banish peace. These were the days when England built her tower, She knowing not, nor heeding. If she heard Aught of the tumult of the popular hope, It seem'd to her like voices in a storm To men whose ship is sinking, far at sea; As they go down they hear but do not heed. At last there came a voice which startled her, And she stood breathless; through the land it went, A murmur, then a trumpet, then a shout,â âThe king is dead.â Due forms of widowhood Fulfill'd in patience, as a debt to God, Not man, because God's seal was on the chain Now sever'd; she put by her royal state, And hurried, like a pardon'd exile, home. There did the ghost of childhood meet with her And stretch its arms to welcome her again, A gentle spectre, but a sorrowful Because so joyous once. But not for that She cameâa living childhood summon'd her; Faint with a six years' fast, the mother's heart Hunger'd, yet fear'd to satisfy its hunger. She sent a herald with a humble word Might she not see her child? She did not ask To break the treaty; this was not a claim, It was a prayer. She would not keep her long, Nor seek her often; for a little while She pray'd that she might sometimes see her child, Just long enough to clasp her, just to quench The fever of her lips on that fresh cheek, To know her face and shape, and mark the growth Which happier eyes had watch'd. Unconsciously The supplication strengthen'd to reproach Which she drew back, and said she was content, He must not think she murmur'd; she was glad To know her daughter in such noble hands; And there she ceased. But when the messenger Was gone, she trembled, and would fetch him back And write her embassage in softer phrase Lest it should fail; and then she fear'd anew And made it prouder, lest she should be shamed By some misjudgment. While she waver'd thus And wept, because the ruthless hours rush'd on, And still her arms were vacant, in the room A voice said, âMother:â 'twas the melody Of her own heart, grown vocal in her ears,â Aye, and the dream was palpable! It stood Before her, and came near, and touch'd her hand So timidlyâwith moist and wistful eyes, Not knowing why they wept, and looking at her As if from a babe's face; remember'd eyes, That almost seem'dâbut that was fantasyâ As if they too remember'd. Love and Death Were mingled for a moment in the cry, The plunge, the anguish of that first embrace! But then she lifts the sweet face from her heart, Puts back the golden curls, and kisses them; Reads all the features, and remembers them; Weeps, wonders, laughs, and makes her rapture soft, Lest it should scare the child, and turns away To hide it, and comes back in sudden fear Lest she should lose a moment of her bliss. Then, with caressing hands upon her cheeks Afraid to loose their hold, she questions her. How came she here? âOh, mother! I was brought.â And was she happy? Silent wonder gave Full answer, for she knew not what it was Not to be happy. âDidst thou know my face? Why seem'd I not a stranger?â Here she drew A picture from the white deep of her breast, And show'd it. âLong ago he gave me this, And bade me never miss to look at it Before my daily prayers. I never did.â There Isabel beheld her own fair face, Seen somewhat nearer to the dewy light Of morn, but not more beautiful than now, A little languid with the heats of noon. She did not ask who gave it, but she blush'd. Out of the same soft nest the same small hand Drew a new treasure. âMother, I was told To give you this. I had well nigh forgot.â She laid the message on her mother's knee, A spray of wither'd myrtle, like a spell To summon sights before the fixing eyes. She fingers it; and how she looks at it! And sees a castle doorway, and a face Half light, half shadow, sorrowful, and proud, And gentleâand a latticeâand a hand That flings a myrtle spray, not wither'd then, No, then a summer bud. âHe went away!â She says and weeps, âAh me! he went away! And IâI was not there when he came back! O! if I had been there when he came back!â Her thoughts destroy the Past, and grasp her life At that far point, and mould it into bliss, Sad still-born bliss, that might have been, and was not! And she looks up, as if to wring from heaven Some medicine for the weariness of hope; Looks up, and sees a face, now all in light, And drops herself upon a ready breast, And feels the circle of protecting arms, And through the dream of that delicious rest Fearing to wake, she hears a living voice, âLo, now I am come back, and thou art here!â CAVOUR. I met a woman, weeping by the sea, Not patiently, as women sit and weep, But running, white with passion, wild with fear, And as she ran she cried, âCavour is dead!â And cast the grey sea-sand upon her hair, And cried, beating her breast, âCavour is dead! Was any near him? Tell me how he look'd When they came in and said that he must die? Must shut the casket, open in his hand, Whose wealth he had seen, not touch'd! Did not the gloom Of that immense regret, shared by the world, Trouble his closing eyes; or were they void? Void as the place he leaves among the powers! In stifled murmurs from the watching crowd, A sea of heads, still as that other sea When it awaits the tempest, he might hear The first pathetic note of his own dirge, Soon to swell out in thunder through the world Vast sobs of grief, cleft by some clarion-tones From foes who kept their silence while he lived; Ah, let them be content; they broke his heart,â He died of Villafranca!â Here she paused, And hid her face. But when I ask'd her name She did not tell it, but she turn'd upon me, And fronted me as stately and as pale As the moon stood on Ajalon, and waited For the first shout of conquest; so she show'd The fatal gift of beauty in her face, And all the tearful traces of the Past; And I beheld her while she answer'd me. âI am his Widow. Do not look at me With that familiar pity, which was mine Before he lived, but never while he lived: I have forgotten how to suffer pity. I am his Widow: bring me to his grave! I think I shall not die upon his grave, But, when I take my place, and wear my crown, And the world wonders, men shall stoop to read, Upon the topmost step of my great throne, An epitaphââHere lies Cavour; a man Who built the throne of Italy, and died.â GARIBALDI AT VARIGNANO. Never subdued till now, Wounded perhaps to death, Did Italy strike the blow? Say it under your breath! She struck him; we strive in vain To cover the pain, the shame,â She struck him who struck not again, But fell while shouting her name. See he is sleeping at last, How can you wish him to wake? Can you give him back to his Past, Crush'd by your hand, for your sake? True to the king he has braved, And who mourns him, misled, undone, Chain'd on the soil he saved, And conquer'd at last, by his own! Write this conquest in tears, And let its record be dim; Hide this year from the stainless years Which had each a wreath for him,â And tell him, there as he lies, He is still our darling chief, And never shame shall touch his name, But only love and grief. Blame his error, and then Blush while his deeds you tell; Guard his prison, Italian men, For whom his name is a spell; Breathe his sentence, thou land! Of which he is still the pride, Sign it, oh! brother-hand, Which fought so long by his side! Italy, royal and free, Forget not the means in the end! And, King, if this thy rebel be, Tell us, who is thy friend? Hide him a little time And bear it! The day shall come For counting his generous crime Among the steps to Rome. Italy, blood like this Should make thee pure as strong; Italy, hearts like his Are precious even in wrong. The heroes of Europe scan, And lift up thy head, and boast Thy Traitor is the truest man Of all the glorious host. AN ANNIVERSARY. SEPTEMBER 7, 1860. On the seventh of September, two little years gone by, For Naples freed by one man's deed, rejoicings shook the sky; There were banners from all windows, and flowers beneath all feet, And a whirl of happy faces as he rode up the street; No crown, except his glory, was on his brow that day, He toil'd, he fought, he conquer'dâto give a crown away. A soldier stands beside him, as friend by friend should stand, And takes the crown so conquer'd, and grasps the gallant hand. âShout for royal Victor! let your vivas ring! Shout for Garibaldi, greater than a king!â SEPTEMBER 7, 1862. On the seventh of September, in this dreariest of years, Darkness covers Naples, and the cloud must break in tears. All hearts are with their hero, in solitude and gloom Captive to the king he crown'd, waiting for his doom. Oh! does he watch the morning, and do his eyes again Faintly flash in triumph, before they close in pain? And in the palace at Turin are eyes this morning wet? All Italy remembers, and can her King forget? Henceforth can any glory, can Rome, can Venice hide One pale heroic Shadow for ever by his side; And, in his ears one bitter cry, piercing all joyful soundsâ âThink on Garibaldi, dying of his wounds!â GARIBALDI IMPEACHED. SEPTEMBER, 1862. Where shall we try Garibaldi? Find us some Italian town Not alive with his renown, Where the air is not on flame With the splendour of his name, Where the pavement of the street Would not rise to kiss his feet, Not till such a place is found, Try him on Italian ground! What men shall judge Garibaldi? Men whose honour is not stain'd When this Captive stands arraign'd, Through whose souls the trumpet-blast Of his story never pass'd, Men of stone, without a tear, Men who can neither see nor hear; Find us such, but not till then Try him by Italian men! THREE VOICES. What saith the Past to thee? Weep! Truth is departed! Beauty hath died like the dream of a sleep, Love is faint-hearted. Trifles of sense, the profoundly unreal, Scare from our spirits God's holy ideal; So, like a funeral bell slow and deep, So tolls the Past to thee,âWeep! How speaks the Present hour? Act! Toil without ceasing! So shall thy footsteps by glory be track'd, Slow, but increasing. Scorn not the smallness of daily endeavour, Let the great meaning ennoble it ever, Droop not o'er efforts expended in vain, Work, as believing that labour is gain. What doth the Future say? Hope! Walk upward glancing! See where light fringes the far-rising slope; Day is advancing. Not for a moment despair of the Right; Nothing can hinder the passing of night! Not for a moment make peace with the wrong, Fear not man's weakness when God is so strong! THE HERMIT OF GIBRALTAR. (A TRUE STORY.) He died among the flowers, when dawn was leaping Like a freed lion through the sever'd east; 'Twere but a waste of tears to mourn him, sleeping White-hair'd and calm, his Bible on his breast. A poor old manâso runs the touching storyâ Lay at the point of death, and vow'd, in prayer, To do some work for God His Saviour's glory, If he were given back to this dear air. He was made whole; and, walking forth at even, Found rapture in the sky, the shore, the sea; And thought it passing strange that earth and heaven Should welcome him with such a jubilee. Unseen he climb'd the rock by paths forbidden, And found a terrace, till that hour untrod, And there began to frame a garden, hidden From human eyes, and only meant for God. There was no witness to his happy working, Save one mute Rose, unwearied watcher sweet, And nightingales among the shadows lurking, Waiting till he should rear them temples meet. No hand gave aid, no eye beheld him wander, Day after day with some fresh pleasant freight; Myrtle or jasmine, royal olÃ«ander, Or maiden lily, or mere violet; Till, like the work within that makes us holy By secret tears, and prayers, and toilsome hours, Not suddenly, but tenderly and slowly, The heart of stone became a nest of flowers; And sometimes, wafted to the pacing warden Like notes of broken music on the breeze, Faint odours, from the roses in the garden Came, blent with breathings of the orange-trees. Even so, perhapsâwe little know how oftenâ The fragrance of some unsuspected prayer, May steal about us on our path, and soften The harsher touches of life's common air. At length one follow'd on the viewless traces From scent to scent, and started to detect That fair flower-city in the rock's embraces, One grey-hair'd man, king, guardian, architect. The soldier had no choice, he dared not pardon, But took him from the haunt of peaceful years, Sad as that exile from a fairer garden, Who first unlock'd for earth the fount of tears. A voice from every leafy depth upbraided, A murmur from each bell, and star, and urn; âHow can'st thou take him ere our bloom is faded? We have such treasures for him still! Return!â He went in grief; but every heart uncloses When the sweet story of his toil is known; And they restored him to his longing roses, And gave him all the garden for his own. A little chapel in the midst was builded, Fretted and gemm'd by Nature's lavish hand, With traceries flung from leaf and flower, and gilded By the perpetual sunlight of the land. There would he sit, and dream of flowers immortal Crowning pale foreheads with their glorious bloom, Not gather'd in the garden at his portal, But from a garden with a sealÃ¨d tomb. And once they came to take him home at even; But âlet me sleep here once!â he gently said, And laid him down between the flowers and heaven, And there they found him in the morning, dead. None knew how Death came to himâsoftly, stilly, It sought him in the silence of the night, As the dew falls upon a closing lily, Infusing life, and making meet for light. But still his garden stands, a solemn pleasaunce Where languid hearts may breathe a little balm, And still it seems alive with the mute presence Of that past life, so innocent and calm. There the transparent stillness wooes reflection, There our repenting thoughts forgive the past, And cleanse the finer links of tried affection, If they be dimm'd by Time's corroding blast. There may we pray that when Death's hour hath found us, We may lie down, like him, to happy rest; Daybreak above, life's song and fragrance round us, And God's dear Word upon each faithful breast. FOR MUSIC. Weep not for death, 'Tis but a fever still'd, A pang suppress'd, a fear at rest, A solemn hope fulfill'd; The moonlight on the sea asleep Is not more calm: why shouldst thou weep? Weep, weep, for change, For gleams that fade in shining, For hope's first fear, for joy's first tear, For strong love's slow declining. Morn's lightest shadow on the seas Tell us of midnight: weep for these! Weep not for death, The fount of tears is seal'd; Who knows how bright the inward light To those shut eyes reveal'd! Who knows what cloudless peace may fill The heart which seems so cold and still! Weep, weep, for life, For smiles that end in sighing, For love whose quest hath never rest, For worn hearts hourly dying; Weep not, when silence locks the breath, Life is the bitterness of death! A SEA-SIDE FANCY. A child stood by the rising sea On a dismal winter's morning, And dream'd what coming life might be, And sigh'd o'er the voice of warning. The distant shores with snow were white, Grey shadows scatter'd o'er them, And a tawny sail had caught the light, As it slowly pass'd before them. But the broken gleams went trembling by, Pallid, and cold, and frail, Like sleet-drops loosen'd from the sky, And dying upon the gale. âO! will my joys, thus dim and few, By gathering tears half-drown'd, Gild but a passing shape or two, And deepen the darkness round? âWith mast aslope and with curving sheet Two barks are scudding fast; They pause, they turn, they seem to greet, Then flit in a moment past. âWill Love and Hope thus swiftly dart O'er my cheerless, cold existence, Doom'd, even ere they meet, to part, And speaking but from a distance? âWill Thought be wing'd by Memory, Like the flight of yon wheeling bird, Which still comes back with a plaintive cry To the spot whence first it stirr'd? âWill the voice that breathes in my heart's deep cells Be like this murmuring sea; A ceaseless voice, but which never swells To a perfect melody? âAnd, as men watch yon rocking boat While it changes from light to dark, Will they watch my life as it lies afloat, While I shiver and toil in the bark? âAnd will that bark on the billows slide Adrift, a helpless wreckââ Child! thou hast dream'd by a rising tide, And the wave is at thy neck. O! may thy strife be quickly o'er, And when the waves retreat, O! may'st thou lie on a pleasant shore With flowers about thy feet! Or if the cold wind still must blow, And the winter sky frown o'er thee, May sunset turn yon heights of snow Into lamps of living glory! ONE AND ANOTHER. They had been much together, and one for ever bears A name upon the loyal heart, and in the daily prayers; The other but remembers when the pleasant hours are past, That something has been sending them so sweetly and so fast. Through golden gates of converse they wander'd at their choice, The soul of one was speakingâonly the other's voice; But grand or lovely was that voice, to suit the changing theme, And the poor soul was satisfied in feeding on a dream. Thus day by day the bond was knit, a strange delight to both; One served in perfect freedom, unconscious of its growth, The other stoop'd in pastime each lavish gift to greet, For even upon a sleeper's lips the wine of love is sweet. But the veil was lifted once, and the heart beheld its place, And took it very calmly, too proud to sue for grace;â No wrongâ'twas but a blunder! no crimeâ'twas but a thought! A small and secret tragedy; none knew that it was wrought. And what remains? A useless link which cannot be undone; A wealth of precious memories, though precious but to one; The colour which slow sunsets leave, staining a breezeless sky With records of past glory, though it only shone to die! A PRAYER FOR ONE BELOVED. Father, I bring before Thy throne A heart more dear to me than mine; O! watch it with Thine eyes benign, And take it, gently, for Thine own. What there Thine eyes condemn, remove, But not by purifying pains,â Thy smile can cleanse the deepest stains, And sin is melted in Thy love. Pour in Thy light, Thy hope, Thy grace, I would not have one shadow stay; But when the whole is perfect day Joy shall beseem so pure a place. Glance lightly, arrows of the foe, Glance lightly from a breast that wears The buckler of a thousand prayers,â Ye have no power to work it woe! Across this heart, Time, softly pass, As a stream flows and leaves no print, Save fresher air and tenderer tint, And lilies shining through the grass. Be life a dome of leaves and dew Through which far heaven is faintly seen, And yet so lovely is the screen, We scarce can wish a nearer view. Ah, friend, how vain! Ev'n while I plead, Perhaps thy doom is on its way; The very moment of the day Is fix'd on which thy heart must bleed. I cannot bar the coming ill, I can but fling my prayers above To that Inexorable Love Which hears, and works Its perfect will. To It I trust thee! Let me stand Beside thee through the painful years, And give some comfort with my tears, Though but the pressure of a hand. LOVE IN SORROW. What shall I do for thee? Thou hast my prayers, Ceaseless as stars around the great white throne; No passing angel but to heaven bears Thy name, wreath'd round with some sweet orison: Yet evil on thy path may come and go Taking deliberate aim to lay thee low, While I stand still, a looker on, to prove The penury and weakness of my love. How shall I comfort thee? My tears are thine, Full duteously upon thy griefs they wait, If thou art wrong'd the bitterness is mine, If thou art lonely I am desolate; Yet still upon thy brow the darkness lies, Still the drops gather in thy plaintive eyes, The nails are sharp, the cross weighs heavily, I cannot weep away one pang for thee. The midnight deepens, and I cannot guide; The tempest threatens, and I cannot shield; I must behold thee wounded, tempted, tried, O, agony! I may behold thee yield! What boots that altar in my heart, whereon Thy royal image stands, unbreath'd upon And safe and guarded from irreverent glance With such array of helpless vigilance? O, were this all! But no! I have the power To grieve thee by unwary tone or deed, Or, niggard in my fears, to miss the hour For comforting with hope thy time of need; To hide, too shyly, half the love I feel, Too roughly touch the wound I come to heal, Or even (O! pardon,) wayward and unjust To wrong thee by some moment of mistrust. Yet I would die for thee, and thou for me; We know this of each other, and forgive These tremblings of our faint humanity, So prompt to die, yet so afraid to live. Look up to heaven, and wait! Love greets us thence, DisrobÃ¨d of its earthly impotence, Man's perfect loveâbelow still doom'd to be Stronger than death, feebler than infancy. WISHES. Looking back, Wander we through life's long track, Looking back, Where a parted sun's soft ray Lingers yet across the way. Gazing home, As the slow bark cleaves the foam, Gazing home; Seems the haven far before Nought to that remember'd shore. From thy side To that shore pale visions glide, Pale beside thee, but they wear Haloes of refulgent air, Standing there; And thou beckonest, but in vain! Never will they come again. O! look on! Turn thy face from glories gone! Underneath yon dim sea-line Founts of deeper glory shine; Watch and wait till in thy sight Shall that dimness turn to light, Pledge of the coming dawn that knows not night. It may be so; I cannot tell, I do not know. Can the frail vine forsake its prop, to lean On cords let down from heaven, unfelt, unseen? I may believe, That hinders not that I should gaze and grieve, Seeking I know not what, and loving what I leave. Chide not my weakness, so the weak heart saith, For love is more than faith. Is there no art, Thou wistful, wayward heart, So to transform thy faith that it shall be The shadow of a near eternity; Not clinging to the hour which cannot last, Not weeping for the perishable past, But eagle-eyed, and patient as a dove, Working, in strength, by love? OUT OF THE DEPTHS. We faint beneath this burning sky, Upon this barren steep, O! give us dew before we die, Give but an hour of sleep! We fail beside this darken'd bed, Where dies our life's last lightâ Voice that of old didst wake the dead, Why, why, so dumb to-night? Hearts we would buckler with our own, We see them bleed and break; In vain our strong cries touch the Throne, O! slay us for their sake! Souls we would give our souls to save, Are wandering far and long: Ah, shut them in the sinless grave, Life does them such deep wrong! When shall this fruitless anguish cease? When rest this weary earth? Was it mere sound, that promised peace, That music of Thy birth? The Voice is very soft and nearâ âYea, strive, and shrink, and die, I spare thee not a single tear, Yet fear not,âIt is I!â RIZPAH. Two days and nights I watch'd the winding of the changeful lights About the ivory shadows of his face, Which, like a rock, lay still, and nothing knew Of gloom or glory in each passing hue That paused upon it. Once, a little while, It quiver'd in the sunset's rapid smile, And then I hid mine eyes, I dared not see What seem'd the waking which must never be. A blast of wings aroused me, and I look'd For coming angels,âbut behold, a bird Came like a spectre, shaking, gaunt and grim, A darkness of great plumes above the place, With cruel craving eyes, and hungry beak That touch'd him where he lay, and never stirr'd; Then I sprang up, and scared it with a shriek That shook the palms, and then I knelt and kiss'd His poor, pale lips, that I might comfort him So helpless now, who, living, had not brook'd One breath of insult near him. But I miss'd The answering kiss that never fail'd before, And, with a rain of tears which had no hope, I cover'd him upon the bare bright slope Beside his brothers, and I look'd no more. My firstborn son! O! wert thou with thy father, when his sword Pierced his strong heart! The day of strife was done, The light lay red upon that evening sward Not only with the redness of the time, When, dying like a dying trumpet-blast, With wrath and grandeur in its faintest chime, He sank as he had stoodâa king to the last! But thouâI dare not whisper of thy death, Lest it should shame thee, sleeping at my feet With those who were in life not dear to me, Save for his sake, whom I loved more than thee; And the wind, striking on my bosom, saith, âO! night, so bitter, closing days so sweet!â And my sobs echo it. O! sweet the day When on my heart that head in slumber lay, Which now lies at my feet! O! bitter night! O! barren dawn, no life is in thy light! I cannot say How long my watch hath been. When by these dead I first sat down, to guard each powerless head That neither beast by night nor bird by day Should stoop upon it, harvest-fields were red; And, now, methinks, a shadow of near rain Hangs on the sky, and softens all the plain. There was a vision came to me at morn; She stood upon a silver floor of dew, The glory of the daybreak seem'd a veil For her refulgent face. The Maid I knew; Her for whom Judah waits and watches, pale With hope, until the wondrous Babe is born! He sate upon the white throne of her breast (As once on mine sate one as fair as He!) And stretch'd His arms above the longing earth. Then I brake forth in praise, that there should be A woman like myself, and yet so blest, Who, crown'd and circled by that glorious birth, Should pass through perfect bliss to perfect rest. âYea, and a sword Shall pierce thine own heart also!â Chill and faint On mine incredulous spirit fell the word, And I was taught the woes of that sweet saint, And, on my face in anguish falling down, I felt the Cross was greater than the Crown. This is the doom Of women; evermore beside the tomb, Where some pale passionate hope is laid asleep, To sit, as in a wilderness, and weep. And I accept it. One laments a Past, Her whole of life, so glorious to the last, That, looking back, she cannot see how dark The wide seas spread before her shrinking bark. One, speechless, weeps for joys that never were, But might have been; her heart's unanswer'd cry Is starved into the silence of despair. One weeps that what she loved is in the grave, And one, for grief is rich in fantasy, Weeps that she had not leave to see it die; One mourns for wrongs she suffer'd and forgave, One waters earth with tears, whose tardy flow Can do no more than make the grave-flowers grow; And oneâO! pity her! weeps for love's waste; The glory of her passion was debased To be the garment of a phantom, born Of her own hopesâa vapour and a scorn, A mountain-shape that melted like a sound, With all her love irreparably crown'd! Then am I blest! God of my fathers, Thou hast given me rest! These my calm faces not a change can stain, Where no hope is I cannot hope in vain, And my tired, troubled heart finds rest, how sweet! Upon this quiet heart which does not beat. Here is my place, my work, my home. He owes To me this charm of desolate repose; Safe in the shelter of my love he lies, I can do all for death which life would prize; Nay, more: he might have spurn'd my needless care. Now am I all to him as he to me, And, dared I lift that sheet,â(I do not dare.) On his dear lips I should not start to see A smile, his father's smile, my meed of yore, âShe hath done what she could!â I ask no more. No more, save here to die. O! here, and soon As a breeze dies upon the breast of noon! TWO WAYS. If only to the darken'd eye Or dying heart, Thy will is sweet, Blind me, O Lord, or let me die At once beneath Thy piercÃ¨d feet; Against my will Thy way I choose, I wish my dearest hopes denied, For I would love Thee, though I lose The power of loving aught beside! But hearts that breathe in purer air Are like a child that finds a flower, And wonders why it is so fair, And wears it for one happy hour; Then, by a father's arm embraced, Springs to him, leans upon his breast, And yields it, ere he ask, in haste To give him what it loves the best. COPERNICUS. The mountain church of Frauenburg Hath many a narrow bed, Where the oaken cross points upward, And peasants weep their dead; Stand we beside this graven stone, And veil the reverent brow, And muse upon the mighty one Whose body lies below. Earth lay in darkness, as a star He rose upon the night, And outlines of the things that are Shone dimly by his light. How dreamy looks the world's wild youth To us of later time, Familiar with God's ancient truth, So simple, so sublime! He first it was whose piercing eye Went through the mists, and saw In endless changes, unity, And in confusion, law. Though other hands unwound the clue To realms of clearer day, All honour to the First is due Who pointed them the way. He moved through life as one who hears And answers from within Faint music from celestial spheres, Through earth's discordant din. Well might he stand with brows inclined, In silence and apart: A thought of the Creator's mind Had pass'd into his heart. What hours were his of happy toil, Toil that itself repays, What victories of bloodless spoil, What fruitful nights and days! For him the very darkness gleam'd With inner radiance fraught, And the solitudes of starlight teem'd With multitudinous thought. Fame hath a jealousy of life, Her fairest wreaths and best Still pass the labour and the strife To crown the time of rest; Long years of lonely working o'er, There came, at length, the hour When to the dying sage they bore The record of his power. In vain! What matter'd then to him All he had hoped and plann'd? The lustre of his life grew dim With perfect day at hand; He leaves for other feet to climb The way which first he trod; His spirit, having done with Time, Stands face to face with God. IN THE NIGHT. Across the moon the beech-tree weaves An airy mystery of leaves, The lights which through that covert pass Glisten like rain-drops on the grass; From clustering woods, unseen, though near, The noise of falling streams I hear; From earth asleep to watching sky Night goeth upward like a sigh. O! surely man and earth were made For silence, solitude, and shade; Life's work seems not to do, but done, The rest achieved, the victory won; Out of all thoughts of sorrow die The sting, the shame, the agony, Joy seems an angel's holy kiss, And grief is but a graver bliss. The Past hath lost its burning dreams, Its vain regrets, and memory seems A wayside well in time of heat, Where we may bathe our weary feet; The Future seems a solemn height A long soft track of temper'd light, Through purer airs we walk, we climb, And from our Home look back on time. Like some great picture nobly wrought, Grows the whole realm of life and thought, We did not know how fair the field, Till here a Master's hand reveal'd Those changing tints we did not mark, Those harmonies of bright and dark, And that far line where, pure and pale, Earth, touching Heaven, must faint and fail. O, Father! is it all in vain? Must we go back to strife again? From Thee these peaceful moments come, These glimpses of the bliss of Home, Ah! let the sweet night overflow, And cleanse the day from sin and woe, For how should evil overpower The soul that saw Thee for one hour! PARTING. Not by thy side, but in thy heart 'Tis mine to dwell; We scorn to utter when we part That feeble word, âFarewell.â Lift up thy weeping eyes, and be Worthy the throne I keep for thee. Like some deep well where at noonday The stars yet shine; My soul seeks darkness that it may Hold all the light of thine; And thou, my trembling star, must be, Pure as the shrine I make for thee. Upon my love thy soul may rest As still and safe, As wild-flowers in a rocky nest Where billows vainly chafe. Alas, poor flower! thou canst not be Strong as the rock which shelters thee! I WENT TO LOOK FOR ROSES. I went to look for roses When snow was on the ground, Alas, a wither'd thorn-bush Was all the flowers I found! I thought of summer-blossoms Alight with dews of morn, And down I sate me weeping Beside the barren thorn. Out spake a grey-hair'd neighbour,â âO madness! not to know The time of living roses Is not the time of snow.â Fie on such foolish comfort! It never dried one tear; I am weeping for my roses Because they are not here. TO A LITTLE GIRL, AGED THREE YEARS AND A HALF. Deep in thy round blue eyes Asleep thy spirit lies, Or half-awake and wanton in its play, As are the thoughts of those Who dally with repose, Dreaming at noon the summer-hours away. To thee each sight or sound Of life's most common round, Twilight or morn, green field or waving tree, Bird, flower, or trembling star, Food for sweet wonder are, Choice spectacles prepared to pleasure thee. Along earth's dreary scene Thou, fearless and serene, As in a softer air, dost breathe and move, Each of thy smiles or tears A potent cause appears For fresh caresses, and for fonder love. No despot's court could be Servile as thine to thee, Thy casual gestures watching and recording; No sage or bard divine Finds audience such as thine, Thy half-form'd words as priceless treasure hoarding. We look on thee and smile, The saddest hearts awhile Forget their tears in thy resistless mirth, As 'mid thick clouds we view One spot of stainless blue, So shows thy life among the griefs of earth. We look on thee and weep, When from its happy sleep Thy soul to its appointed task shall rise; Must ruthless sorrow chase The brightness from that face? Must tears become familiar to those eyes? We look on thee and fear, How can we greet thee here, Thou sinless stranger in a world of shame; Shall earthly breath or blight Sully the stainless white Whereon was written once thy Saviour's name? Childhood's unconscious heart, A sacred thing thou art, An ark of peace with ceaseless storms around; Man, ere thou dare intrude On that bright solitude, Put off thy shoesâthe place is holy ground. Well may we look on thee, Fresh in thy purity, By no doubt troubled, by no sin defiled, And pray (Christ spake the word)â âTeach us to love Thee, Lord, Even in the spirit of a little child!â A DIRGE. Let her rest! Weary were her days, oppress'd By vain cravings to be blest. Let her sleep! Slumber holy, dreamless, deep, Cover eyes that waked to weep. Let her rest! Death is spread upon her breast, Like soft wings that shade a nest. Let her sleep! False and cruel love, to keep Weeping,âshe hath ceased to weep. Let her die! All her hope beneath the sky Was in her mortality. SUNSET. Is it the foot of God Upon the waters, that they seethe and blaze As when of old He trod The desert ways, And through the night, Fearful and far His pillar pour'd its light? O! for strong wings to fly Under the limit of yon dazzling verge, Where bright tints rapidly In brighter merge, And yet more bright Till light becomes invisible through light. What wonder that of yore Men held thee for a deity, great Sun, Kindling thy pyre before Thy race is run, Casting life down At pleasure, to resume it as a crown? Or that our holier prayer Still consecrates thy symbol? that our fanes Plant their pure altars where Thine eastern glory rains, And thy bright west Drops prophet-mantles on our beds of rest? Here, watching, let us kneel Through the still darkness of this grave-like time, Till on our ears shall steal A whisper, then a chime, And then a chorusâEarth has burst her prison, The Sign is in the skies,âthe sun is risen! MAIDENHOOD. Her heart is light, her fancy free, Her morn of womanhood, Fresh as the wind that curls the sea, Is chainless and unwoo'd; The thoughts her bosom's realm that fill Are vassals only of her will. Her soul flings wide a hundred gates Wide as their span can reach, For universal beauty waits To enter in through each; The mighty tome of earth and skies She ponders with delighted eyes. And all serene and holy loves Are tenants of her breast, Separate yet close, like brooding doves, Each on its own dear nest; Most sweet and precious are the things Which grow beneath their folded wings. If sorrow's sudden wind profanes The garden of her bliss, Her taught and guarded spirit gains A blessing e'en from this; As from Bethesda's troubled wave An angel rose to heal and save. Or if some bright deluding dream Her peace of mind betray, As glaciers in the sunlight gleam Only to melt away, If rainbow-hopes, that shine and die, Give place to pale reality, If longings wild and vain oppress Her scarce resisting will, Till earth seems one wide wilderness, And love itself grows chill; These are a sickness of the heart,â Health will return, and these depart. The circle of her home's calm shade Is all her heart can crave; Life seems a shelter'd green arcade, And, at its end, a grave, Where beckoning Faith, with upward eyes, Stands, just descended from the skies. THE SHADOW FROM THE VALLEY. The child upon the mountain-side Plays fearless and at ease, While the hush of purple evening Spreads over earth and seas; The valley lies in shadow, But the valley lies afar, And the mountain is a slope of light Up-reaching to a star. He looks into the forest, Where, like a shower of gems, Drops of delicious sunshine Dance on the tawny stems; He listens to the large grey thrush Slow flitting to its bower, But the shadow from the valley Creeps upward, hour by hour. The stream that flows above him Breaks into sudden gold, Caught from the gorgeous banner O'er the broad skies unroll'd; He looks where, 'mid the parting clouds, A thousand rainbows meet,â But the shadow from the valley Hath risen to his feet. Awhile the lingering glory Touches and gilds his hair, Then darkness, like an armÃ¨d man, Hath seized him unaware; The latest bird is silent, And, with a wild Tu-whoo, The swift owl circles overhead,â Ah child, what canst thou do? Wilt thou, in hopeless wonder, Wring thy faint hands and weep, Roam aimlessly a little while, Then sob thyself to sleep? Or wilt thou rise, and journey Thy drear and toilsome way, A pilgrim through the shadow, Seeking the dawn of day? There shall be stars to guide thee, There shall be sounds to cheer, For the air is full of angels, And God is very near; And ever from thy distant home One tiny spark shall glow, Brightening as thou draw'st nearer,â Take courage! Rise and go! THE PAINTER. A hall it was, where myriad lamps a richer daylight made, And folds of falling purple gave harmony to shade; And odours, spreading softly, and lingering on the air, Seem'd weightier than the nothings that men were murmuring there. It was a board where rainbow-fruits on golden salvers glanced, And, like a flood of melted gems, the merry winestream danced, And couches of Etruscan grace stood round, that there might be, Ev'n in the body's needs a kind of meaner poetry. Round went the health, the Painter's name from lip to lip goes round, And the lifted goblets ring, and the stricken boards resound; Triumphant smiles the Painter, with a bowing monarch's mien, And seems to feel the deathless crown upon his brows serene. He hears the circling whisper: âThe wonder of our time!â âHe painted Lady Margaretâthe velvet was sublime! You could have touch'd the downy curl that trembled on her cheek; Her lips were shut so softly, you paused to hear them speak.â And smiling sits the Painter, as the music lulls his sense; This was his art's achievement, and this its recompense;â Till, one by one, the guests are gone as smoothly as they came, And to his studio door he staggers drunk with fame. Wan and white, in the drear moonlight, his works upon him stare, As the flicker of his lonely lamp just gilds them here and there, They seem a spectral army, with a false faint life possess'd, They gather round, they ask for souls, and smite each empty breast. The daylight queen nods from the wall, a plumed and sceptred ghost, And smiles back to the mocking smiles of all her ghastly host; There is no movement, yet they seem to stir and cluster round; There goes a whisper through the room, he starts, and hears no sound. He laughs away the fancy, he hath reach'd his easel now, And there stands still and gazes, cold hand on burning brow; 'Tis but a sketch, like many more around him loosely piled, A simple theme oft tried in vainâthe Mother and the Child. One glares in gaudy drapery, a very tavern-sign; One hath chill tints and wooden limbs, nor human nor divine; One seems a peasant-maiden, with a fair babe at play; And one a dame of quality in some quaint masque-array. He grasps the brush, he labours, like a man whom frenzy stings; The swift night flutters by and shows faint gleams upon her wings; He pausesâlo! a foolish face smiles soft on his dismay, One that might weep and be consoled a dozen times a-day! âWhy am I baffled thus?â cries the Painter in his wrath, âI who have toil'd so valiantly along the upward path, Gathering the glories of all time to swell my vast renown, Standing on past achievements to grasp a present crown! âI have been in stately galleries where Art her treasure keeps, Where, dreaming of the day to come, the speechless Future sleeps; I have loved all Nature's wonder-realms, her pomp of sun and shade, Her council of grave mountains, rock-girded, cloud-array'd; âWhere the sweeping lights across them like sea-birds glance and dart, And the silence of their shadows is like thunder in the heart, And pale rocks glimmer faintly through dark and hollow glooms, Like visions of some old churchyard all populous with tombs. âAnd on still days, when sultry skies seem blue from pole to pole, And slow waves creep across the sand like years across the soul, And their murmur hath a measure like the chime of distant bells, I have gather'd thoughts along the shore, as children gather shells. âOut of these garner'd riches I would create at last, The hand obeys the will, and the beauties gather fast, Smooth are the tints and true the lines,â'tis finish'd! woe is me! One touch by old Angelico holds more divinity! âWhy am I baffled thus? Does Art stand still and then rebound, Like tides that know their limits, and retreat when these are found? Is not the Past her empire? must not she rather be A river widening as it flows into the endless sea?â He ceases. Is it slumber that is stealing on him now? A fall of sudden twilight drops cool upon his brow, And through its wan and mazy gleams a narrow cell he sees, And a grey lonely figureâa man upon his knees. Lips eloquent in silence, deep eyes and full of light, Brow peaceful as a babe's, where yet the cleansing dews are bright, While, by the moon's dim lustre, he dreams that he can trace The seal'd cross faintly shining through the shadows of that face. The vision hath a sense of time; a night hath glided by, And from his knees the man of prayer hath risen silently, As on the first fair Easter-morn the waken'd saints arose, When the moving of the sealÃ¨d stone broke on their long repose; So, with a glory on his brow, he rose; 'twas strange to view How, under his swift finger, a wondrous picture grew; Grew, like a flower unfolded by some deep living law, Scarce seen by him: his spirit's eye its own deep vision saw. Lo, as from linkÃ¨d notes ye weave a harmony divine, A perfect face is growing from blended tint and line; How gravely falls the golden hair by each transparent cheek! How lofty is the posture! the lifted gaze how meek! See the bright pity of those eyes, those tender brows and pure, The sorrow of those sever'd lips, calm waiting to endure; She clasps the babe against her heart, nor shrinks, yet sees revealed The sword that is to pierce her, through ev'n that awful shield. The Mother and the Childâit is again that simple theme,â Love born of grief! The Painter hath started from his dream; When a soft voice comes suddenly, like dew on evening air, âSo went Angelico to workâsay, how didst thou prepare?â</field>
