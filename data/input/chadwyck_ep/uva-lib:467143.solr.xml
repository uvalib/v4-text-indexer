      <field name="fulltext">[Oh, be not led away] Oh, be not led away, Lured by the colour of the sun-rich day. The gay romance of song Unto the spirit life doth not belong: Though far-between the hours In which the Master of Angelic powers Lightens the dusk within The holy of holies, be it thine to win Rare vistas of white light, Half-parted lips through which the Infinite Murmurs its ancient story, Hearkening to whom the wandering planets hoary Waken primeval fires, With deeper rapture in celestial choirs Breathe, and with fleeter motion Wheel in their orbits through the surgeless ocean. So hearken thou like these, Intent on it, mounting by slow degrees, Until thy song's elation Echoes the multitudinous meditation. AWAKENING The lights shone down the street In the long blue close of day: A boy's heart beat sweet, sweet, As it flowered in its dreamy clay Beyond the dazzling throng And above the towers of men The stars made him long, long, To return to their light again. They lit the wondrous years And his heart within was gay; But a life of tears, tears, He had won for himself that day. BY THE MARGIN OF THE GREAT DEEP When the breath of twilight blows to flame the misty skies, All its vaporous sapphire, violet glow and silver gleam With their magic flood me through the gateway of the eyes; I am one with the twilight's dream. When the trees and skies and fields are one in dusky mood, Every heart of man is rapt within the mother's breast: Full of peace and sleep and dreams in the vasty quietude, I am one with their hearts at rest. From our immemorial joys of hearth and home and love Strayed away along the margin of the unknown tide, All its reach of soundless calm can thrill me far above Word or touch from the lips beside. Aye, and deep and deep and deeper let me drink and draw From the olden fountain more than light or peace or dream, Such primeval being as o'erfills the heart with awe, Growing one with its silent stream. THE UNKNOWN GOD Far up the dim twilight fluttered Moth-wings of vapour and flame: The lights danced over the mountains, Star after star they came. The lights grew thicker unheeded, For silent and still were we; Our hearts were drunk with a beauty Our eyes could never see. THE HERMIT Now the quietude of earth Nestles deep my heart within; Friendships new and strange have birth Since I left the city's din. Here the tempest stays its guile, Like a big kind brother plays, Romps and pauses here awhile From its immemorial ways. Now the silver light of dawn, Slipping through the leaves that fleck My one window, hurries on, Throws its arms around my neck. Darkness to my doorway hies, Lays her chin upon the roof, And her burning seraph eyes Now no longer keep aloof. And the ancient mystery Holds its hands out day by day, Takes a chair and croons with me By my cabin built of clay. When the dusky shadow flits, By the chimney nook I see Where the old enchanter sits, Smiles and waves and beckons me. OVERSOUL I am Beauty itself among beautiful things. Bhagavad-Gita. The East was crowned with snow-cold bloom And hung with veils of pearly fleece: They died away into the gloom, Vistas of peaceâand deeper peace. And earth and air and wave and fire In awe and breathless silence stood; For One who passed into their choir Linked them in mystic brotherhood. Twilight of amethyst, amid Thy few strange stars that lit the heights, Where was the secret spirit hid? Where was Thy place, O Light of Lights? The flame of Beauty far in spaceâ Where rose the fire: in Thee? in Me? Which bowed the elemental race To adoration silently? THE GREAT BREATH Its edges foamed with amethyst and rose, Withers once more the old blue flower of day: There where the ether like a diamond glows Its petals fade away. A shadowy tumult stirs the dusky air; Sparkle the delicate dews, the distant snows; The great deep thrills, for through it everywhere The breath of Beauty blows. I saw how all the trembling ages past, Moulded to her by deep and deeper breath, Neared to the hour when Beauty breathes her last And knows herself in death. DUSK Dusk wraps the village in its dim caress; Each chimney's vapour, like a thin grey rod, Mounting aloft through miles of quietness, Pillars the skies of God. Far up they break or seem to break their line, Mingling their nebulous crests that bow and nod Under the light of those fierce stars that shine Out of the calm of God. Only in clouds and dreams I felt those souls In the abyss, each fire hid in its clod; From which in clouds and dreams the spirit rolls Into the vast of God. NIGHT Heart-hidden from the outer things I rose; The spirit woke anew in nightly birth Unto the vastness where forever glows The star-soul of the earth. There all alone in primal ecstasy, Within her depths where revels never tire, The olden Beauty shines: each thought of me Is veined through with its fire. And all my thoughts are throngs of living souls; They breathe in me, heart unto heart allied; Their joy undimmed, though when the morning tolls The planets may divide. DAWN Still as the holy of holies breathes the vast, Within its crystal depths the stars grow dim; Fire on the altar of the hills at last Burns on the shadowy rim. Moment that holds all moments; white upon The verge it trembles; then like mists of flowers Break from the fairy fountain of the dawn The hues of many hours. Thrown downward from that high companionship Of dreaming inmost heart with inmost heart, Into the common daily ways I slip My fire from theirs apart. DAY In day from some titanic past it seems As if a thread divine of memory runs; Born ere the Mighty One began his dreams, Or yet were stars and suns. But here an iron will has fixed the bars; Forgetfulness falls on earth's myriad races: No image of the proud and morning stars Looks at us from their faces. Yet yearning still to reach to those dim heights, Each dream remembered is a burning-glass, Where through to darkness from the Light of Lights Its rays in splendour pass. ECHOES The might that shaped itself through storm and stress In chaos, here is lulled in breathing sweet; Under the long brown ridge in gentleness Its fierce old pulses beat. Quiet and sad we go at eve; the fire That woke exultant in an earlier day Is dead; the memories of old desire Only in shadows play. We liken love to this and that; our thought The echo of a deeper being seems: We kiss, because God once for beauty sought Within a world of dreams. STAR TEACHERS Even as a bird sprays many-coloured fires, The plumes of paradise, the dying light Rays through the fevered air in misty spires That vanish in the height. These myriad eyes that look on me are mine; Wandering beneath them I have found again The ancient ample moment, the divine, The God-root within men. For this, for this the lights innumerable As symbols shine that we the true light win: For every star and every deep they fill Are stars and deeps within. WINTER A diamond glow of winter o'er the world: Amid the chilly halo nigh the west Flickers a phantom violet bloom unfurled Dim on the twilight's breast. Only phantasmal blooms but for an hour, A transient beauty; then the white stars shine Chilling the heart: I long for thee to flower, O bud of light divine. But never visible to sense or thought The flower of Beauty blooms afar withdrawn; If in our being then we know it not, Or, knowing, it is gone. ANSWER The warmth of life is quenched with bitter frost; Upon the lonely road a child limps by Skirting the frozen pools: our way is lost: Our hearts sink utterly. But from the snow-patched moorland chill and drear, Lifting our eyes beyond the spirÃ«d height, With white-fire lips apart the dawn breathes clear Its soundless hymn of light. Out of the vast the voice of one replies Whose words are clouds and stars and night and day, When for the light the anguished spirit cries Deep in its house of clay. THE GIFT I thought, beloved, to have brought to you A gift of quietness and ease and peace, Cooling your brow as with the mystic dew Dropping from twilight trees. Homeward I go not yet; the darkness grows; Not mine the voice to still with peace divine: From the first fount the stream of quiet flows Through other hearts than mine. Yet of my night I give to you the stars, And of my sorrow here the sweetest gains, And out of hell, beyond its iron bars, My scorn of all its pains. THE DIVINE VISION This mood hath known all beauty, for it sees O'erwhelmed majesties In these pale forms, and kingly crowns of gold On brows no longer bold, And through the shadowy terrors of their hell The love for which they fell, And how desire which cast them in the deep Called God too from His sleep. Oh, Pity, only seer, who looking through A heart melted like dew, Seest the long perished in the present thus, For ever dwell in us. Whatever time thy golden eyelids ope They travel to a hope; Not only backward from these low degrees To starry dynasties, But, looking far where now the silence owns And rules from empty thrones, Thou seest the enchanted hills of heaven burn For joy at our return. Thy tender kiss hath memory we are kings For all our wanderings. Thy shining eyes already see the after In hidden light and laughter. FROLIC The children were shouting together And racing along the sands, A glimmer of dancing shadows, A dovelike flutter of hands. The stars were shouting in heaven, The sun was chasing the moon: The game was the same as the children's, They danced to the self-same tune. The whole of the world was merry, One joy from the vale to the height, Where the blue woods of twilight encircled The lovely lawns of the light. DESIRE With Thee a moment! Then what dreams have play! Traditions of eternal toil arise, Search for the high, austere and lonely way The Spirit moves in through eternities. Ah, in the soul what memories arise! And with what yearning inexpressible, Rising from long forgetfulness I turn To Thee, invisible, unrumoured, still: White for Thy whiteness all desires burn. Ah, with what longing once again I turn! THE PLACE OF REST The soul is its own witness and its own refuge. Unto the deep the deep heart goes, It lays its sadness nigh the breast: Only the Mighty Mother knows The wounds that quiver unconfessed. It seeks a deeper silence still; It folds itself around with peace, Where thoughts alike of good or ill In quietness unfostered cease. It feels in the unwounding vast For comfort for its hopes and fears: The Mighty Mother bows at last; She listens to her children's tears. Where the last anguish deepensâthere The fire of beauty smites through pain: A glory moves amid despair, The Mother takes her child again. THE DAWN OF DARKNESS Come earth's little children pit-pat from their burrows on the hill; Hangs within the gloom its weary head the shining daffodil. In the valley underneath us through the fragrance flit along Over fields and over hedgerows little quivering drops of song. All adown the pale blue mantle of the mountains far away Stream the tresses of the twilight flying in the wake of day. Night comes; soon alone shall fancy follow sadly in her flight Where the fiery dust of evening, shaken from the feet of light, Thrusts its monstrous barriers between the pure, the good, the true, That our weeping eyes may strain for, but shall never after view. Only yester eve I watched with heart at rest the nebulÃ¦ Looming far within the shadowy shining of the Milky Way; Finding in the stillness joy and hope for all the sons of men; Now what silent anguish fills a night more beautiful than then. For earth's age of pain has come, and all her sister planets weep, Thinking of her fires of morning passing into dreamless sleep. In this cycle of great sorrow for the moments that we last We too shall be linked by weeping to the greatness of her past: But the coming race shall know not, and the fount of tears shall dry, And the arid heart of man be arid as the desert sky. So within my mind the darkness dawned, and round me everywhere Hope departed with the twilight, leaving only dumb despair. WAITING When the dawn comes forth I wonder Will our sad, sad hearts awaken, And the grief we laboured under From the new-in-joy be shaken? If the night be long in going, All our souls will fix in sadness; And the light of morning glowing Waken in our eyes no gladness. All unschooled in mirth we will not Rouse forgotten joys from sleeping; And the dawn our pain shall still not: We will gaze on it with weeping. THE SYMBOL SEDUCES There in her old-world garden smiles A symbol of the world's desire, Striving with quaint and lovely wiles To bind to earth the soul of fire. And while I sit and listen there, The robe of Beauty falls away From universal things to where Its image dazzles for a day. Away! the great life calls; I leave For Beauty, Beauty's rarest flower; For Truth, the lips that ne'er deceive; For Love, I leave Love's haunted bower. REST On me to rest, my bird, my bird: The swaying branches of my heart Are blown by every wind toward The home whereto their wings depart. Build not your nest, my bird, on me; I know no peace but ever sway: O lovely bird, be free, be free, On the wild music of the day. But sometimes when your wings would rest, And winds are laid on quiet eves: Come, I will bear you breast to breast, And lap you close with loving leaves. PITY The twinkling mists of green and gold Afloat in the abyss of air, From out the window high and old We watched together there. The monstrous fabric of the town Lay black below; the cries of pain Came to our ears from up and down The dimly-lighted lane. Olive, your eyes were turned to me, Seeking a soul to sympathise: I wondered what that glow might be, Olive, within your eyes. Into your trembling words there passed The sorrow that was sighed through you: Pity, a breath from out the vast, From unknown hollows blew. THE CITY Full of Zeus the cities: full of Zeus the harbours: full of Zeus are all the ways of men. What domination of what darkness dies this hour, And through what new, rejoicing, winged, ethereal power O'erthrown, the cells opened, the heart released from fear? Gay twilight and grave twilight pass. The stars appear O'er the prodigious, smouldering, dusky, city flare. The hanging gardens of Babylon were not more fair Than these blue flickering glades, where childhood in its glee Re-echoes with fresh voice the heaven-lit ecstasy. Yon girl whirls like an eastern dervish. Her dance is No less a god-intoxicated dance than his, Though all unknowing the arcane fire that lights her feet, What motions of what starry tribes her limbs repeat. I, too, firesmitten, cannot linger: I know there lies Open somewhere this hour a gate to Paradise, Its blazing battlements with watchers thronged, O where? I know not, but my flame-winged feet shall lead me there. O, hurry, hurry, unknown shepherd of desires, And with thy flock of bright imperishable fires Pen me within the starry fold, ere the night falls And I am left alone below immutable walls. Or am I there already, and is it Paradise To look on mortal things with an immortal's eyes? Above the misty brilliance the streets assume A night-dilated blue magnificence of gloom Like many-templed Nineveh tower beyond tower; And I am hurried on in this immortal hour. Mine eyes beget new majesties: my spirit greets The trams, the high-built glittering galleons of the streets That float through twilight rivers from galaxies of light. Nay, in the Fount of Days they rise, they take their flight, And wend to the great deep, the Holy Sepulchre. Those dark misshapen folk to be made lovely there Hurry with me, not all ignoble as we seem, Lured by some inexpressible and gorgeous dream. The earth melts in my blood. The air that I inhale Is like enchanted wine poured from the Holy Grail. What was that glimmer then? Was it the flash of wings As through the blinded mart rode on the King of Kings? O stay, departing glory, stay with us but a day, And burning seraphim shall leap from out our clay, And plumed and crested hosts shall shine where men have been, Heaven hold no lordlier court than earth at College Green. Ah, no, the wizardy is over; the magic flame That might have melted all in beauty fades as it came. The stars are far and faint and strange. The night draws down. Exiled from light, forlorn, I walk in Dublin Town. Yet had I might to lift the veil, the will to dare, The fiery rushing chariots of the Lord are there, The whirlwind path, the blazing gates, the trumpets blown, The halls of heaven, the majesty of throne by throne, Enraptured faces, hands uplifted, welcome sung By the thronged gods, tall, golden-coloured, joyful, young. DUST I heard them in their sadness say, âThe earth rebukes the thought of God; We are but embers wrapped in clay A little nobler than the sod.â But I have touched the lips of clay, Mother, thy rudest sod to me Is thrilled with fire of hidden day, And haunted by all mystery. THE VIRGIN MOTHER Who is that goddess to whom men should pray, But her from whom their hearts have turned away, Out of whose virgin being they were born, Whose mother nature they have named with scorn Calling its holy substance common clay. Yet from this so despised earth was made The milky whiteness of those queens who swayed Their generations with a light caress, And from some image of whose loveliness The heart built up high heaven when it prayed. Lover, your heart, the heart on which it lies, Your eyes that gaze and those alluring eyes, Your lips, the lips they kiss, alike had birth Within that dark divinity of earth, Within that mother being you despise. Ah, when I think this earth on which I tread Hath borne these blossoms of the lovely dead, And makes the living heart I love to beat, I look with sudden awe beneath my feet As you with erring reverence overhead. DANA I am the tender voice calling âAway,â Whispering between the beatings of the heart, And inaccessible in dewy eyes I dwell, and all unkissed on lovely lips, Lingering between white breasts inviolate, And fleeting ever from the passionate touch, I shine afar, till men may not divine Whether it is the stars or the beloved They follow with rapt spirit. And I weave My spells at evening, folding with dim caress, Aerial arms and twilight dropping hair, The lonely wanderer by wood or shore, Till, filled with some deep tenderness, he yields, Feeling in dreams for the dear mother heart He knew, ere he forsook the starry way, And clings there, pillowed far above the smoke And the dim murmur from the duns of men. I can enchant the trees and rocks, and fill The dumb brown lips of earth with mystery, Make them reveal or hide the god. I breathe A deeper pity than all love, myself Mother of all, but without hands to heal: Too vast and vague, they know me not. But yet, I am the heartbreak over fallen things, The sudden gentleness that stays the blow, And I am in the kiss that foemen give Pausing in battle, and in the tears that fall Over the vanquished foe, and in the highest, Among the Danaan gods, I am the last Council of mercy in their hearts where they Mete justice from a thousand starry thrones. THE EARTH BREATH From the cool and dark-lipped furrows Breathes a dim delight Through the woodland's purple plumage To the diamond night. Aureoles of joy encircle Every blade of grass Where the dew-fed creatures silent And enraptured pass. And the restless ploughman pauses, Turns and, wondering, Deep beneath his rustic habit Finds himself a king; For a fiery moment looking With the eyes of God Over fields a slave at morning Bowed him to the sod. Blind and dense with revelation Every moment flies, And unto the Mighty Mother, Gay, eternal, rise All the hopes we hold, the gladness, Dreams of things to be. One of all thy generations, Mother, hails to thee. Hail, and hail, and hail for ever, Though I turn again From thy joy unto the human Vestiture of pain. I, thy child who went forth radiant In the golden prime, Find thee still the mother-hearted Through my night in time; Find in thee the old enchantment There behind the veil Where the gods, my brothers, linger. Hail, forever, hail! ALTER EGO All the morn a spirit gay Breathes within my heart a rhyme, 'Tis but hide and seek we play In and out the courts of time. Fairy lover, when my feet Through the tangled woodland go, 'Tis thy sunny fingers fleet Fleck the fire dews to and fro. In the moonlight grows a smile Mid its rays of dusty pearlâ 'Tis but hide and seek the while, As some frolic boy and girl. When I fade into the deep Some mysterious radiance showers From the jewel-heart of sleep Through the veil of darkened hours. Where the ring of twilight gleams Round the sanctuary wrought, Whispers haunt meâin my dreams We are one yet know it not. Some for beauty follow long Flying traces; some there be Seek thee only for a song: I to lose myself in thee. NATURAL MAGIC We are tired who follow after Phantasy and truth that flies: You with only look and laughter Stain our hearts with richest dyes When you break upon our study Vanish all our frosty cares; As the diamond deep grows ruddy, Filled with morning unawares. With the stuff that dreams are made of But an empty house we build: Glooms we are ourselves afraid of, By the ancient starlight chilled. All unwise in thought or dutyâ Still our wisdom envies you: We who lack the living beauty Half our secret knowledge rue. Thought nor fear in you nor dreaming Veil the light with mist about; Joy, as through a crystal gleaming, Flashes from the gay heart out. Pain and penitence forsaking, Hearts like cloisters dim and grey, By your laughter lured, awaking Join with you the dance of day. CHILDHOOD How I could see through and through you! So unconscious, tender, kind, More than ever was known to you Of the pure ways of your mind. We who long to rest from strife Labour sternly as a duty; But a magic in your life Charms, unknowing of its beauty. We are pools whose depths are told; You are like a mystic fountain, Issuing ever pure and cold From the hollows of the mountain. We are men by anguish taught To distinguish false from true; Higher wisdom we have not; But a joy within guides you. THREE COUNSELLORS It was the fairy of the place, Moving within a little light, Who touched with dim and shadowy grace The conflict at its fever height. It seemed to whisper âQuietness,â Then quietly itself was gone: Yet echoes of its mute caress Were with me as the years went on. It was the warrior within Who called âAwake, prepare for fight: Yet lose not memory in the din: Make of thy gentleness thy might: âMake of thy silence words to shake The long-enthroned kings of earth: Make of thy will the force to break Their towers of wantonness and mirth.â It was the wise all-seeing soul Who counselled neither war nor peace: âOnly be thou thyself that goal In which the wars of time shall cease.â SYMBOLISM Now when the spirit in us wakes and broods, Filled with home yearnings, drowsily it flings From its deep heart high dreams and mystic moods, Mixed with the memory of the loved earth things: Clothing the vast with a familiar face; Reaching its right hand forth to greet the starry race. Wondrously near and clear the great warm fires Stare from the blue; so shows the cottage light To the field labourer whose heart desires The old folk by the nook, the welcome bright From the house-wife long parted from at dawnâ So the star villages in God's great depths withdrawn. Nearer to Thee, not by delusion led, Though there no house fires burn nor bright eyes gaze: We rise, but by the symbol charioted, Through loved things rising up to Love's own ways: By these the soul unto the vast has wings And sets the seal celestial on all mortal things. IMMORTALITY We must pass like smoke or live within the spirit's fire; For we can no more than smoke unto the flame return If our thought has changed to dream, our will unto desire, As smoke we vanish though the fire may burn. Lights of infinite pity star the grey dusk of our days: Surely here is soul: with it we have eternal breath: In the fire of love we live, or pass by many ways, By unnumbered ways of dream to death. MYSTERY Why does this sudden passion smite me? I stretch my hands, all blind to see: I need the lamp of the world to light me, Lead me and set me free. Something a moment seemed to stoop from The night with cool, cool breath on my face: Or did the hair of the twilight droop from Its silent wandering ways? About me in the thick wood netted The wizard glow looks human-wise; And over the tree-tops barred and fretted Ponders with strange old eyes. The tremulous lips of air blow by me And hymn their time-old melody: Its secret strain comes nigh and nigh me: âAh, brother, come with me; âFor here the ancient mother lingers To dip her hands in the diamond dew, And lave thine ache with cloud-cool fingers Till sorrow die from you.â A NEW WORLD I who had sought afar from earth The faery land to meet, Now find content within its girth And wonder nigh my feet. To-day a nearer love I choose And seek no distant sphere; For aureoled by faery dews The dear brown breasts appear. With rainbow radiance come and go The airy breaths of day; And eve is all a pearly glow With moonlit winds a-play. The lips of twilight burn my brow, The arms of night caress: Glimmer her white eyes drooping now With grave old tenderness. I close mine eyes from dream to be The diamond-rayed again, As in the ancient hours ere we Forgot ourselves to men. And all I thought of heaven before I find in earth below: A sunlight in the hidden core To dim the noonday glow. And with the earth my heart is glad, I move as one of old; With mits of silver I am clad And bright with burning gold. SACRIFICE Those delicate wanderers, The wind, the star, the cloud, Ever before mine eyes, As to an altar bowed, Light and dew-laden airs Offer in sacrifice. The offerings arise: Hazes of rainbow light, Pure crystal, blue, and gold, Through dreamland take their flight; And 'mid the sacrifice God moveth as of old. In miracles of fire He symbols forth his days; In gleams of crystal light Reveals what pure pathways Lead to the soul's desire, The silence of the height. BROTHERHOOD Twilight, a blossom grey in shadowy valleys dwells: Under the radiant dark the deep blue-tinted bells In quietness reÃ¯mage heaven within their blooms, Sapphire and gold and mystery. What strange perfumes, Out of what deeps arising, all the flower-bells fling, Unknowing the enchanted odorous song they sing! Oh, never was an eve so living yet: the wood Stirs not but breathes enraptured quietude. Here in these shades the ancient knows itself, the soul, And out of slumber waking starts unto the goal. What bright companions nod and go along with it! Out of the teeming dark what dusky creatures flit, That through the long leagues of the island night above Come by me, wandering, whispering, beseeching love; As in the twilight children gather close and press Nigh and more nigh with shadowy tenderness, Feeling they know not what, with noiseless footsteps glide Seeking familiar lips or hearts to dream beside. O voices, I would go with you, with you, away, Facing once more the radiant gateways of the day; With you, with you, what memories arise, and nigh Trampling the crowded figures of the dawn go by, Dread deities, the giant powers that warred on men Grow tender brothers and gay children once again; Fades every hate away before the Mother's breast Where all the exiles of the heart return to rest. ON A HILL-TOP Bearded with dewy grass the mountains thrust Their blackness high into the still grey light, Deepening to blue: far up the glimmering height In silver transience shines the starry dust. Silent the sheep about me; fleece by fleece They sleep and stir not: I with awe around Wander uncertain o'er the giant mound, A fire that moves between their peace and peace. The city myriads dream or sleep below; Aloft another day has but begun: Under the radiance of the Midnight Sun The Tree of Life put forth its leaves to grow. Wiser than they below who dream or sleep? I know not; but their day is dream to me, And in their darkness I awake to see A Thought that moves like light within the deep. Only from dream to dream our spirits pass. Well, let us rise and fly from sphere to sphere; Some one of all unto the light more near Mirrors the Dreamer in its glowing glass. THE VOICE OF THE WATERS Where the Greyhound River windeth through a loneliness so deep, Scarce a wild fowl shakes the quiet that the purple boglands keep, Only God exults in silence over fields no man may reap. Where the silver wave with sweetness fed the tiny lives of grass I was bent above, my image mirrored in the fleeting glass, And a voice from out the water through my being seemed to pass. âStill above the waters brooding, spirit, in thy timeless quest; Was the glory of thine image trembling over east and west Not divine enough when mirrored in the morning water's breast?â With the sighing voice that murmured I was borne to ages dim Ere the void was lit with beauty breathed upon by seraphim, We were cradled there together folded in the peace in Him. One to be the master spirit, one to be the slave awoke, One to shape itself obedient to the fiery words we spoke, Flame and flood and stars and mountains from the primal waters broke. I was huddled in the heather when the vision failed its light, Still and blue and vast above me towered aloft the solemn height, Where the stars like dewdrops glistened on the mountain slope of night. KRISHNA (Imitated from a fragment of the Vaishnava Scriptures.) I paused beside the cabin door and saw the King of Kings at play, Tumbled upon the grass I spied the little heavenly runaway. The mother laughed upon the child made gay by its ecstatic morn, And yet the sages spake of It as of the Ancient and Unborn. I heard the passion breathed amid the honey-suckle scented glade, And saw the King pass lightly from the beauty that he had betrayed. I saw him pass from love to love; and yet the pure allowed His claim To be the purest of the pure, thrice holy, stainless, without blame. I saw the open tavern door flash on the dusk a ruddy glare, And saw the King of Kings outcast reel brawling through the starlit air. And yet He is the Prince of Peace of whom the ancient wisdom tells, And by their silence men adore the lovely silence where He dwells. I saw the King of Kings again, a thing to shudder at and fear, A form so darkened and so marred that childhood fled if it drew near. And yet He is the Light of Lights whose blossoming is Paradise, That Beauty of the King which dawns upon the seers' enraptured eyes. I saw the King of Kings again, a miser with a heart grown cold, And yet He is the Prodigal, the Spendthrift of the Heavenly Gold, The largesse of whose glory crowns the blazing brows of cherubim, And sun and moon and stars and flowers are jewels scattered forth by Him. I saw the King of Kings descend the narrow doorway to the dust With all his fires of morning still, the beauty, bravery, and lust. And yet He is the life within the Ever-living Living Ones, The ancient with eternal youth, the cradle of the infant suns, The fiery fountain of the stars, and He the golden urn where all The glittering spray of planets in their myriad beauty fall. FREEDOM I will not follow you, my bird, I will not follow you. I would not breathe a word, my bird, To bring thee here anew. I love the free in thee, my bird, The lure of freedom drew; The light you fly toward, my bird, I fly with thee unto. And there we yet will meet, my bird, Though far I go from you Where in the light outpoured, my bird, Are love and freedom too. THE EARTH They tell me that the earth is still the same Although the Red Branch now is but a name, That yonder peasant lifting up his eyes Can see the marvel of the morning rise, The wonder Deirdre gazed on when she came. I cannot think the hearts that beat so high Had not a lordlier palace roof of sky, And that the earth on which the heroes trod Seemed not to live beneath them like a god Who loved them and could answer to their cry. Who said the sun will shine with equal face Alike upon the noble and the base? The mighty only to the mighty seems; The world that loomed through proud and golden dreams Has dropped behind this world and left no trace. When that the proud and golden race passed by, This cold paternal majesty on high, This unresponsive earth beneath the feet, Replaced the dear brown breasts that were so sweet, The face of brooding love within the sky. How could a beggar wear the kingly crown, Or those who weakly laid the sceptre down, Walk 'mid the awful beauty God had made For those whose hearts were proud and unafraid, Careless if on His face were smile or frown? TO ONE CONSECRATED Your paths were all unknown to us: We were so far away from you: We mixed in thought your spirit thusâ With whiteness, stars of gold, and dew. The Mighty Mother nourished you; Her breath blew from her mystic bowers; Their elfin glimmer floated through The pureness of your shadowy hours. The Mighty Mother made you wise, Gave love that clears the hidden ways; Her glooms were glory to your eyes, Her darkness but the fount of days. You with all gentleness she graced, And beauty radiant as the morn's: She made our joy in yours, then placed Upon your head a crown of thorns. Your eyes are filled with tender light For those whose eyes are dim with tears: They see your brow is crowned and bright But not its ring of wounding spears. FORGIVENESS At dusk the window panes grew grey; The wet world vanished in the gloom; The dim and silver end of day Scarce glimmered through the little room. And all my sins were told; I said Such things to her who knew not sinâ The sharp ache throbbing in my head, The fever running high within. I touched with pain her purity; Sin's darker sense I could not bring: My soul was black as night to me; To her I was a wounded thing. I needed love no words could say; She drew me softly nigh her chair, My head upon her knees to lay, With cool hands that caressed my hair. She sat with hands as if to bless, And looked with grave, ethereal eyes; Ensouled by ancient Quietness, A gentle priestess of the Wise. A WOMAN'S VOICE His head within my bosom lay, But yet his spirit slipped not through: I only felt the burning clay That withered for the cooling dew. It was but pity when I spoke And called him to my heart for rest, And half a mother's love that woke Feeling his head upon my breast: And half the lion's tenderness To shield her cubs from hurt or death, Which, when the serried hunters press, Makes terrible her wounded breath. But when the lips I breathed upon Asked for such love as equals claimâ I looked where all the stars were gone Burned in the day's immortal flame. âCome thou like yon great dawn to me From darkness vanquished, battles done: Flame unto flame shall flow and be Within thy heart and mine as one.â THE SPIRIT OF THE GAY With the glamour of the Gay How you made our hearts to flame; Gave each life some airy aim: Ever round you seemed to play Sunlight from some inner day. Dazzling as with red and gold; Rich with beauty, love and youthâ How were we to know the truth, That if all the tale were told Life for you was sad and cold? For you found if we would wake And the joy make young each heart, You who told must stand apart: And you bore it for our sake, Though your heart was nigh to break. So your life was like a sphere's: One side, all aglow, meets day, And the other turned away, Icy-strange and cold appears, Overhung with starry tears. HEROIC LOVE When our glowing dreams were dead, Ruined our heroic piles, Something in your dark eyes said: âThink no more of love or smiles.â Something in me still would say, âThough our dreamland palace goes, I have seen how in decay Still the wild rose clings and blows.â But your dark eyes willed it thus: âBuild our lofty dream again: Let our palace rise o'er us: Love can never be till then.â DIVINE VISITATION The heavens lay hold on us: the starry rays Fondle with flickering fingers brow and eyes: A new enchantment lights the ancient skies. What is it looks between us gaze on gaze; Does the wild spirit of the endless days Chase through my heart some lure that ever flies? Only I know the vast within me cries Finding in thee the ending of all ways. Ah, but they vanish; the immortal train From thee, from me, depart, yet take from thee Memorial grace: laden with adoration Forth from this heart they flow that all in vain Would stay the proud eternal powers that flee After the chase in burning exultation. PARTING As from our dream we died away Far off I felt the outer things: Your wind-blown tresses round me play, Your bosom's gentle murmurings. And far away our faces met As on the verge of the vast spheres: And in the night our cheeks were wet, I could not say with dew or tears. O gate by which I entered in! O face and hair! O lips and eyes! Through you again the world I win, How far away from Paradise! NIGHT Burning our hearts out with longing The daylight passed: Millions and millions together, The stars at last! Purple the woods where the dewdrops, Pearly and grey, Wash in the cool from our faces The flame of day. Glory and shadow grow one in The hazel wood: Laughter and peace in the stillness Together brood. Hopes all unearthly are thronging In hearts of earth: Tongues of the starlight are calling Our souls to birth. Down from the heaven its secrets Drop one by one; Where time is for ever beginning And time is done. There light eternal is over Chaos and night: Singing with dawn lips for ever, âLet there be light!â There too for ever in twilight Time slips away, Closing in darkness and rapture Its awful day. DAWN SONG While the earth is dark and grey How I laugh within. I know In my breast what ardours gay From the morning overflow. Though the cheek be white and wet In my heart no fear may fall: There my chieftain leads and yet Ancient battle trumpets call. Bend on me no hasty frown If my spirit slight your cares: Sunlike still my joy looks down Changing tears to beamy airs. Think me not of fickle heart If with joy my bosom swells Though your ways from mine depart, In the true are no farewells. What I love in you I find Everywhere. A friend I greet In each flower and tree and windâ Oh, but life is sweet, is sweet! What to you are bolts and bars Are to me the arms that guide To the freedom of the stars, Where my golden kinsmen bide. From my mountain top I view: Twilight's purple flower is gone, And I send my song to you On the level light of dawn. THE HOUR OF THE KING Who would think this quiet breather From the world had taken flight? Yet within the form we see there Wakes the Golden King to-night. Out upon the face of faces He looked forth before his sleep: Now he knows the starry races Haunters of the ancient deep. On the Bird of Diamond Glory Floats in mystic floods of song: As he lists Time's triple story Seems but as a day is long. From the mightier Adam falling To his image dwarfed in clay, He will at our voices calling Come to this side of the day. When he wakes, the dreamy-hearted, He will know not whence he came, And the light from which he parted Be the seraph's sword of flame, And behind it hosts supernal Guarding the lost paradise, And the tree of life eternal From the weeping human eyes. THE HEROES By many a dream of God and man my thoughts in shining flocks were led: But as I went through Patrick Street the hopes and prophecies were dead. The hopes and prophecies were dead: they could not blossom where the feet Walked amid rottenness, or where the brawling shouters stamped the street. Where was the beauty that the Lord gave men when first they towered in pride? But one came by me at whose word the bitter condemnation died. His brows were crowned with thorns of light: his eyes were bright as one who sees The starry palaces shine o'er the sparkle of the heavenly seas. âIs it not beautiful?â he cried. âOur Faery Land of Hearts' Desire Is mingled through the mire and mist, yet stainless keeps its lovely fire. The pearly phantoms with blown hair are dancing where the drunkards reel: The cloud frail daffodils shine out where filth is splashing from the heel. O sweet, and sweet, and sweet to hear, the melodies in rivers run: The rapture of their crowded notes is yet the myriad voice of One. Those who are lost and fallen here, to-night in sleep shall pass the gate, Put on the purples of the King, and know them masters of their fate. Each wrinkled hag shall reassume the plumes and hues of paradise: Each brawler be enthroned in calm among the Children of the Wise. Yet in the council with the gods no one will falter to pursue His lofty purpose, but come forth the cyclic labours to renew; And take the burden of the world and veil his beauty in a shroud, And wrestle with the chaos till the anarch to the light be bowed. We cannot for forgetfulness forego the reverence due to them Who wear at times they do not guess the sceptre and the diadem. As bright a crown as this was theirs when first they from the Father sped; Yet look with deeper eyes and still the ancient beauty is not dead.â He mingled with the multitude. I saw their brows were crowned and bright, A light around the shadowy heads, a shadow round the head of light. PAIN Men have made them gods of love, Sun-gods, givers of the rain, Deities of hill and grove: I have made a god of Pain. Of my god I know this much, And in singing I repeat, Though there's anguish in his touch, Yet his soul within is sweet. SELF-DISCIPLINE When the soul sought refuge in the place of rest, Overborne by strife and pain beyond control, From some secret hollow, whisper soft-confessed, Came the legend of the soul. Some bright one of old time laid his sceptre down So his heart might learn of sweet and bitter truth; Going forth bereft of beauty, throne, and crown, And the sweetness of his youth. So the old appeal and fierce revolt we make Through the world's hour dies within our primal will; And we justify the pain and hearts that break, And our lofty doom fulfil. THE MAN TO THE ANGEL I have wept a million tears: Pure and proud one, where are thine, What the gain though all thy years In unbroken beauty shine? All your beauty cannot win Truth we learn in pain and sighs: You can never enter in To the circle of the wise. They are but the slaves of light Who have never known the gloom, And between the dark and bright Willed in freedom their own doom. Think not in your pureness there, That our pain but follows sin: There are fires for those who dare Seek the throne of might to win. Pure one, from your pride refrain: Dark and lost amid the strife I am myriad years of pain Nearer to the fount of life. When defiance fierce is thrown At the god to whom you bow, Rest the lips of the Unknown Tenderest upon my brow. A VISION OF BEAUTY Where we sat at dawn together, while the star-rich heavens shifted, We were weaving dreams in silence, suddenly the veil was lifted. By a hand of fire awakened, in a moment caught and led Upward to the heaven of heavensâthrough the star-mists overhead Flare and flaunt the monstrous highlands; on the sapphire coast of night Fall the ghostly froth and fringes of the ocean of the light. Many coloured shine the vapours: to the moon-eye far away 'Tis the fairy ring of twilight, mid the spheres of night and day, Girdling with a rainbow cincture round the planet where we go, We and it together fleeting, poised upon the pearly glow; We and it and all together flashing through the starry spaces In a tempest dream of beauty lighting up the face of faces. Half our eyes behold the glory; half within the spirit's glow Echoes of the noiseless revels and the will of Beauty go. By a hand of fire upliftedâto her star-strewn palace brought, To the mystic heart of beauty and the secret of her thought: Here of yore the ancient Mother in the fire mists sank to rest, And she built her dreams about her, rayed from out her burning breast: Here the wild will woke within her lighting up her flying dreams, Round and round the planets whirling break in woods and flowers and streams, And the winds are shaken from them as the leaves from off the rose, And the feet of earth go dancing in the way that beauty goes, And the souls of earth are kindled by the incense of her breath As her light alternate lures them through the gates of birth and death. O'er the fields of space together following her flying traces, In a radiant tumult thronging, suns and stars and myriad races Mount the spirit spires of beauty, reaching onward to the day When the Shepherd of the Ages draws his misty hordes away Through the glimmering deeps to silence, and within the awful fold Life and joy and love forever vanish as a tale is told, Lost within the Mother's being. So the vision flamed and fled, And before the glory fallen every other dream lay dead. THE VESTURE OF THE SOUL I pitied one whose tattered dress Was patched, and stained with dust and rain; He smiled on me; I could not guess The viewless spirit's wide domain. He said, âThe royal robe I wear Trails all along the fields of light: Its silent blue and silver bear For gems the starry dust of night. âThe breath of Joy unceasingly Waves to and fro its folds starlit, And far beyond earth's misery I live and breathe the joy of it.â THE FREE They bathed in the fire-flooded fountains: Life girdled them round and about: They slept in the clefts of the mountains: The stars called them forth with a shout. They prayed, but their worship was only The wonder at nights and at days, As still as the lips of the lonely Though burning with dumbness of praise. No sadness of earth ever captured Their spirits who bowed at the shrine: They fled to the Lonely enraptured And hid in the darkness divine. As children at twilight may gather, They met at the doorway of death The smile of the dark hidden Father, The Mother with magical breath. Untold of in song or in story, In days long forgotten of men, Their eyes were yet blind with a glory Time will not remember again. COMFORT Dark head by the fireside brooding, Where upon your ears Whirlwinds of the earth intruding Sound in wrath and tears: Tender-hearted, in your lonely Sorrow I would fain Comfort you, and say that only Gods could feel such pain. Only spirits know such longing For the far away; And the fiery fancies thronging Rise not out of clay. Keep the secret sense celestial Of the starry birth; Though about you call the bestial Voices of the earth. If a thousand ages since Hurled us from the throne: Then a thousand ages wins Back again our own. Sad one, dry away your tears: Mount again anew: In the great ancestral spheres Waits the throne for you. WARNING Pure at heart we wander now: Comrade on the quest divine, Turn not from the stars your brow That your eyes may rest on mine. Pure at heart we wander now: We have hopes beyond to-day; And our quest does not allow Rest or dreams along the way. We are, in our distant hope, One with all the great and wise: Comrade, do not turn or grope For some lesser light that dies. We must rise or we must fall: Love can know no middle way: If the great life do not call, Then is sadness and decay. DREAM LOVE I did not deem it half so sweet To feel thy gentle hand, As in a dream thy soul to greet Across wide leagues of land. Untouched more near to draw to you Where, amid radiant skies, Glimmered thy plumes of iris hue, My Bird of Paradise. Let me dream only with my heart, Love first, and after see: Know thy diviner counterpart Before I kneel to thee. So in thy motions all expressed Thy angel I may view: I shall not on thy beauty rest, But beauty's self in you. REFUGE Twilight, a timid fawn, went glimmering by, And Night, the dark-blue hunter, followed fast, Ceaseless pursuit and flight were in the sky, But the long chase had ceased for us at last. We watched together while the driven fawn Hid in the golden thicket of the day. We, from whose hearts pursuit and flight were gone, Knew on the hunter's breast her refuge lay. THE BURNING-GLASS A shaft of fire that falls like dew, And melts and maddens all my blood, From out thy spirit flashes through The burning-glass of womanhood. Only so far; here must I stay: Nearer I miss the light, the fire; I must endure the torturing ray, And with all beauty, all desire. Ah, time long must the effort be, And far the way that I must go To bring my spirit unto thee, Behind the glass, within the glow. BABYLON The blue dusk ran between the streets: my love was winged within my mind, It left to-day and yesterday and thrice a thousand years behind. To-day was past and dead for me, for from to-day my feet had run Through thrice a thousand years to walk the ways of ancient Babylon. On temple top and palace roof the burnished gold flung back the rays Of a red sunset that was dead and lost beyond a million days. The tower of heaven turns darker blue, a starry sparkle now begins; The mystery and magnificence, the myriad beauty and the sins Come back to me. I walk beneath the shadowy multitude of towers; Within the gloom the fountain jets its pallid mist in lily flowers. The waters lull me and the scent of many gardens, and I hear Familiar voices, and the voice I love is whispering in my ear. Oh real as in dream all this; and then a hand on mine is laid: The wave of phantom time withdraws; and that young Babylonian maid, One drop of beauty left behind from all the flowing of that tide, Is looking with the self-same eyes, and here in Ireland by my side. Oh light our life in Babylon, but Babylon has taken wings, While we are in the calm and proud procession of eternal things. THE FACES OF MEMORY Dream faces bloom around your face Like flowers upon one stem; The heart of many a vanished race Sighs as I look on them. The sun rich face of Egypt glows, The eyes of Eire brood, With whom the golden Cyprian shows In lovely sisterhood. Your tree of life put forth these flowers In ages past away: They had the love in other hours I give to you to-day. One light their eyes have, as may shine One star on many a sea, They look that tender love on mine That lights your glance on me. They fade in you; their lips are fain To meet the old caress: And all their love is mine again As lip to lip we press. THE MESSAGE Do you not feel the white glow in your breast, my bird? That is the flame of love I send to you from afar: Not a wafted kiss, hardly a whispered word, But love itself that flies as a white-winged star. Let it dwell there, let it rest there, at home in your heart: Wafted on winds of gold, it is Love itself, the Dove. Not the god whose arrows wounded with bitter smart, Nor the purple-fiery birds of death and love. Do not ask for the hands of love or love's soft eyes: They give less than love who give all, giving what wanes. I give you the star-fire, the heart-way to Paradise, With no death after, no arrow with stinging pains. THE SINGING SILENCES While the yellow constellations shine with pale and tender glory, In the lilac-scented stillness let us listen to earth's story. All the flowers like moths a-flutter glimmer rich with dusky hues; Everywhere around us seem to fall from nowhere the sweet dews. Through the drowsy lull, the murmur, stir of leaf and sleepy hum, We can feel a gay heart beating, hear a magic singing come. Ah, I think that as we linger lighting at earth's olden fire Fitful gleams in clay that perish, little sparks that soon expire: So the Mother brims her gladness from a life beyond her own, From whose darkness as a fountain up the fiery days are thrown; Starry words that wheel in splendour, sunny systems, histories, Vast and nebulous traditions told in the eternities. And our listening Mother whispers through her children all the story. Come: the yellow constellations shine with pale and tender glory! AFFINITY You and I have found the secret way, None can bar our love or say us nay: All the world may stare and never know You and I are twined together so. You and I for all his vaunted width Know the giant Space is but a myth; Over miles and miles of pure deceit You and I have found our lips can meet. You and I have laughed the leagues apart In the soft delight of heart to heart. If there's a gulf to meet or limit set, You and I have never found it yet. You and I have trod the backward way To the happy heart of yesterday, To the love we felt in ages past. You and I have found it still to last. You and I have found the joy had birth In the angel childhood of the earth, Hid within the heart of man and maid. You and I of Time are not afraid. You and I can mock his fabled wing, For a kiss is an immortal thing. And the throb wherein those old lips met Is a living music in us yet. A CALL Dusk its ash-grey blossoms sheds on violet skies, Over twilight mountains where the heart songs rise, Rise and fall and fade away from earth to air. Earth renews the music sweeter. Oh, come there. Come, acushla, come, as in ancient times Rings aloud the underland with faery chimes. Down the unseen ways as strays each tinkling fleece Winding ever onward to a fold of peace, So my dreams go straying in a land more fair; Half I tread the dew-wet grasses, half wander there. Fade your glimmering eyes in a world grown cold; Come, acushla, with me to the mountains old. There the bright ones call us waving to and froâ Come, my children, with me to the ancient go. CARROWMORE It's a lonely road through bogland to the lake at Carrowmore, And a sleeper there lies dreaming where the water laps the shore; Though the moth-wings of the twilight in their purples are unfurled, Yet his sleep is filled with music by the masters of the world. There's a hand is white as silver that is fondling with his hair: There are glimmering feet of sunshine that are dancing by him there: And half-open lips of faery that were dyed a faery red In their revels where the Hazel Tree its holy clusters shed. âCome away,â the red lips whisper, âall the world is weary now; 'Tis the twilight of the ages and it's time to quit the plough. Oh, the very sunlight's weary ere it lightens up the dew, And its gold is changed and faded before it falls to you. âThough your colleen's heart be tender, a tenderer heart is near. What's the starlight in her glances when the stars are shining clear? Who would kiss the fading shadow when the flower-face glows above? 'Tis the beauty of all Beauty that is calling for your love.â Oh, the great gates of the mountain have opened once again, And the sound of song and dancing falls upon the ears of men, And the Land of Youth lies gleaming, flushed with rainbow light and mirth, And the old enchantment lingers in the honey-heart of earth. THE DREAM OF THE CHILDREN The children awoke in their dreaming While earth lay dewy and still: They followed the rill in its gleaming To the heart-light of the hill. Its sounds and sights were forsaking The world as they faded in sleep, When they heard a music breaking Out from the heart-light deep. It ran where the rill in its flowing Under the star-light gay, With wonderful colour was glowing Like the bubbles they blew in their play. From the misty mountain under Shot gleams of an opal star; Its pathways of rainbow wonder Rayed to their feet from afar. From their feet as they strayed in the meadow It led through caverned aisles, Filled with purple and green light and shadow For mystic miles on miles. The children were glad: it was lonely To play on the hillside by day. âBut now,â they said, âwe have only To go where the good people stray.â For all the hillside was haunted By the faery folk come again; And down in the heart-light enchanted Were opal-coloured men. They moved like kings unattended Without a squire or dame, But they wore tiaras splendid With feathers of starlight flame. They laughed at the children over And called them into the heart. âCome down here, each sleepless rover; We will show you some of our art.â And down through the cool of the mountain The children sank at the call, And stood in a blazing fountain And never a mountain at all. The lights were coming and going In many a shining strand, For the opal fire-kings were blowing The darkness out of the land. This golden breath was a madness To set a poet on fire; And this was a cure for sadness, And that the ease of desire. They said as dawn glimmered hoary, âWe will show yourselves for an hour.â And the children were changed to a glory By the beautiful magic of power. The fire-kings smiled on their faces And called them by olden names, Till they towered like the starry races All plumed with the twilight flames. They talked for a while together How the toil of ages oppressed, And of how they best could weather The ship of the world to its rest. The dawn in the room was straying: The children began to blink, When they heard a far voice saying âYou can grow like that if you think.â The sun came in yellow and gay light: They tumbled out of the cot: And half of the dream went with daylight And half was never forgot. INSPIRATION Lightest of dancers, with no thought Thy glimmering feet beat on my heart, Gayest of singers, with no care Waking to beauty the still air, More than the labours of our art, More than our wisdom can impart, Thine idle ecstasy hath taught. Lost long in solemn ponderings, With the blind shepherd mind for guide, The uncreated joy in you Hath lifted up my heart unto The morning stars in their first pride, And the angelic joys that glide High upon heaven-uplifted wings. A MEMORY You remember, dear, together Two children, you and I, Sat once in the autumn weather, Watching the autumn sky. There was some one round us straying The whole of the long day through, Who seemed to say, âI am playing At hide and seek with you.â And one thing after another Was whispered out of the air, How God was a big, kind brother Whose home is in everywhere. His light like a smile comes glancing Through the cool, cool winds as they pass From the flowers in heaven dancing To the stars that shine in the grass. From the clouds in deep blue wreathing And most from the mountains tall, But God like a wind goes breathing A dream of Himself in all. The heart of the Wise was beating Sweet, sweet, in our hearts that day: And many a thought came fleeting And fancies solemn and gay. We were grave in our way divining How childhood was taking wings, And the wonder world was shining With vast eternal things. The solemn twilight fluttered Like the plumes of seraphim, And we felt what things were uttered In the sunset voice of Him. We lingered long, for dearer Than home were the mountain places Where God from the stars dropt nearer Our pale, dreamy faces. Our very hearts from beating We stilled in awed delight, For spirit and children were meeting In the purple, ample night. A SUMMER NIGHT Her mist of primroses within her breast Twilight hath folded up, and o'er the west, Seeking remoter valleys long hath gone, Not yet hath come her sister of the dawn. Silence and coolness now the earth enfold, Jewels of glittering green, long mists of gold, Hazes of nebulous silver veil the height, And shake in tremors through the shadowy night. Heard through the stillness, as in whispered words, The wandering God-guided wings of birds Ruffle the dark. The little lives that lie Deep hid in grass join in a long-drawn sigh More softly still; and unheard through the blue The falling of innumerable dew, Lifts with grey fingers all the leaves that lay Burned in the heat of the consuming day. The lawns and lakes lie in this night of love, Admitted to the majesty above. Earth with the starry company hath part; The waters hold all heaven within their heart, And glimmer o'er with wave-lips everywhere Lifted to meet the angel lips of air. The many homes of men shine near and far, Peace-laden as the tender evening star, The late home-coming folk anticipate Their rest beyond the passing of the gate, And tread with sleep-filled hearts and drowsy feet. Oh, far away and wonderful and sweet All this, all this. But far too many things Obscuring, as a cloud of seraph wings Blinding the seeker for the Lord behind, I fall away in weariness of mind. And think how far apart are I and you, Beloved, from those spirit children who Felt but one single Being long ago, Whispering in gentleness and leaning low Out of its majesty, as child to child. I think upon it all with heart grown wild. Hearing no voice, howe'er my spirit broods, No whisper from the dense infinitudes, This world of myriad things whose distance awes. Ah me; how innocent our childhood was! THE WEAVER OF SOULS Who is this unseen messenger For ever between me and her, Who brings love's precious merchandise, The golden breath, the dew of sighs, And the wild, gentle thoughts that dwell Too fragile for the lips to tell, Each at their birth, to us before A heaving of the heart is o'er? Who art thou, unseen messenger? I think, O Angel of the Lord, You make our hearts to so accord That those who hear in after hours May sigh for love as deep as ours; And seek the magic that can give An Eden where the soul may live, Nor need to walk a road of clay With stumbling feet, nor fall away From thee, O Angel of the Lord. THE SILENCE OF LOVE I could praise you once with beautiful words ere you came And entered my life with love in a wind of flame. I could lure with a song from afar my bird to its nest, But with pinions drooping together silence is best. In the land of beautiful silence the winds are laid, And life grows quietly one in the cloudy shade. I will not waken the passion that sleeps in the heart, For the winds that blew us together may blow us apart. Fear not the stillness; for doubt and despair shall cease With the gentle voices guiding us into peace. Our dreams will change as they pass through the gates of gold, And Quiet, the tender shepherd, shall keep the fold. CREATION As one by one the veils took flight, The day withdrew, the stars came up. The spirit issued pale and bright Filling thy beauty like a cup. Sacred thy laughter on the air, Holy thy lightest word that fell, Proud the innumerable hair That waved at the enchanter's spell. O, Master of the Beautiful, Creating us from hour to hour, Give me this vision to the full To see in lightest things thy power. This vision give, no heaven afar, No throne, and yet I will rejoice Knowing beneath my feet a star Thy word in every wandering voice. THE WINDS OF ANGUS The grey road whereupon we trod became as holy ground: The eve was all one voice that breathed its message with no sound: And burning multitudes pour through my heart, too bright, too blind, Too swift and hurried in their flight to leave their tale behind. Twin gates unto that living world, dark honey-coloured eyes, The lifting of whose lashes flushed the face with Paradise, Beloved, there I saw within their ardent rays unfold The likeness of enraptured birds that flew from deeps of gold To deeps of gold within my breast to rest, or there to be Transfigured in the light, or find a death to life in me. So love, a burning multitude, a seraph wind that blows From out the deep of being to the deep of being goes. And sun and moon and starry fires and earth and air and sea Are creatures from the deep let loose, who pause in ecstasy, Or wing their wild and heavenly way until again they find The ancient deep, and fade therein, enraptured, bright, and blind. APHRODITE Not unremembering we pass our exile from the starry ways: One timeless hour in time we caught from the long night of endless days. With solemn gaiety the stars danced far withdrawn on elfin heights: The lilac breathed amid the shade of green and blue and citron lights. But yet the close enfolding night seemed on the phantom verge of things, For our adoring hearts had turned within from all their wanderings: For beauty called to beauty, and there thronged at the enchanter's will The vanished hours of love that burn within the Ever-living still. And sweet eternal faces put the shadows of the earth to rout, And faint and fragile as a moth your white hand fluttered and went out. Oh, who am I who tower beside this goddess of the twilight air? The burning doves fly from my heart, and melt within her bosom there. I know the sacrifice of old they offered to the mighty queen, And this adoring love has brought us back the beauty that has been. As to her worshippers she came descending from her glowing skies, So Aphrodite I have seen with shining eyes look through your eyes: One gleam of the ancestral face which lighted up the dawn for me: One fiery visitation of the love the gods desire in thee! THE MEMORY OF EARTH In the wet dusk silver sweet, Down the violet scented ways, As I moved with quiet feet I was met by mighty days. On the hedge the hanging dew Glassed the eve and stars and skies; While I gazed a madness grew Into thundered battle cries. Where the hawthorn glimmered white, Flashed the spear and fell the strokeâ Ah, what faces pale and bright Where the dazzling battle broke! There a hero-hearted queen With young beauty lit the van: Gone! the darkness flowed between All the ancient wars of man. While I paced the valley's gloom Where the rabbits pattered near, Shone a temple and a tomb With the legend carven clear: âTime put by a myriad fates That her day might dawn in glory; Death made wide a million gates So to close her tragic story.â THE VEILS OF MAYA Mother, with whom our lives should be, Not hatred keeps our lives apart: Charmed by some lesser glow in thee, Our hearts beat not within thy heart. Beauty, the face, the touch, the eyes, Prophets of thee, allure our sight From that unfathomed deep where lies Thine ancient loveliness and light. Self-found at last, the joy that springs Being thyself, shall once again Start thee upon the whirling rings And through the pilgrimage of pain. IN THE WOMB Still rests the heavy share on the dark soil: Upon the black mould thick the dew-damp lies: The horse waits patient: from his lowly toil The ploughboy to the morning lifts his eyes. The unbudding hedgerows dark against day's fires Glitter with gold-lit crystals: on the rim Over the unregarding city's spires The lonely beauty shines alone for him. And day by day the dawn or dark enfolds And feeds with beauty eyes that cannot see How in her womb the mighty mother moulds The infant spirit for eternity. SUNG ON A BY-WAY What of all the will to do? It has vanished long ago, For a dream-shaft pierced it through From the Unknown Archer's bow. What of all the soul to think? Some one offered it a cup Filled with a diviner drink, And the flame has burned it up. What of all the hope to climb? Only in the self we grope To the misty end of time: Truth has put an end to hope. What of all the heart to love? Sadder than for will or soul, No light lured it on above; Love has found itself the whole. JANUS Image of beauty, when I gaze on thee, Trembling I waken to a mystery, How through one door we go to life or death By spirit kindled or the sensual breath. Image of beauty, when my way I go; No single joy or sorrow do I know: Elate for freedom leaps the starry power, The life which passes mourns its wasted hour. And, ah, to think how thin the veil that lies Between the pain of hell and paradise! Where the cool grass my aching head embowers God sings the lovely carol of the flowers. THE GREY EROS We are desert leagues apart; Time is misty ages now Since the warmth of heart to heart Chased the shadows from my brow. Oh, I am so old, meseems I am next of kin to Time, The historian of her dreams From the long-forgotten prime. You have come a path of flowers. What a way was mine to roam! Many a fallen empire's towers, Many a ruined heart my home. No, there is no comfort, none. All the dewy tender breath Idly falls when life is done On the starless brow of death. Though the dream of love may tire, In the ages long agone There were ruby hearts of fireâ Ah, the daughters of the dawn! Though I am so feeble now, I remember when our pride Could not to the Mighty bow; We would sweep His stars aside. Mix thy youth with thoughts like thoseâ It were but to wither thee, But to graft the youthful rose On the old and flowerless tree. Age is no more near than youth To the sceptre and the crown. Vain the wisdom, vain the truth; Do not lay thy rapture down. DUALITY From me spring good and evil. Who gave thee such a ruby flaming heart And such a pure cold spirit? Side by side I know these must eternally abide In intimate war, and each to each impart Life from its pain, in every joy a dart To wound with grief or death the self allied. Red life within the spirit crucified, The eyes eternal pity thee: thou art Fated with deathless powers at war to be, Not less the martyr of the world than he Whose thorn-crowned brow usurps the due of tears We would pay to thee, ever ruddy life, Whose passionate peace is still to be at strife, O'erthrown but in the unconflicting spheres. TRUTH The hero first thought it To him 'twas a deed: To those who retaught it, A chain on their speed. The fire that we kindled, A beacon by night, When darkness has dwindled Grows pale in the light. For life has no glory Stays long in one dwelling, And time has no story That's true twice in telling. And only the teaching That never was spoken Is worthy thy reaching, The fountain unbroken. FANTASY Over all the dream-built margin, flushed with grey and hoary light, Glint the bubble planets tossing in the dead black sea of night. Immemorial face, how many faces look from out thy skies, Now with ghostly eyes of wonder rimmed around with rainbow dyes: Now the secrets of the future trail along the silent spheres: Ah, how often have I followed filled with phantom hopes and fears, Where my star that rose dream-laden, moving to the mystic crown, On the yellow moon-rock foundered and my joy and dreams went down. As a child with hands uplifted peering through the cloudless miles Bent the Mighty Mother o'er me shining all with eyes and smiles: âCome up hither, child, my darlingâ: waving to the habitations, Thrones, and starry kings around her, dark embattled planet nations. There the mighty rose in greeting, as their child from exile turning Smiled upon the awful faces o'er the throne supernal burning. As with sudden sweetness melting, shone the eyes, the hearts of home, Changed the vision, and the Mother vanished in the vasty dome. So from marvel unto marvel turned the face I gazed upon, Till its fading majesty grew tender as a child at dawn, And the heaven of heavens departed and the visions passed away With the seraph of the darkness martyred in the fires of day. THE MOUNTAINEER Oh, at the eagle's height To lie i' the sweet of the sun, While veil after veil takes flight And God and the world are one. Oh, the night on the steep! All that his eyes saw dim Grows light in the dusky deep, And God is alone with him. THE GOLDEN AGE When the morning breaks above us And the wild sweet stars have fled, By the faery hands that love us Wakened you and I will tread Where the lilacs on the lawn Shine with all their silver dews, In the stillness of a dawn Wrapped in tender primrose hues. We will hear the strange old song That the earth croons in her breast, Echoed by the feathered throng Joyous from each leafy nest. Earth, whose dreams are we and they, With her heart's deep gladness fills All our human lips can say, Or the dawn-fired singer trills. She is rapt in dreams divine: As her clouds of beauty pass, On our glowing hearts they shine, Mirrored there as in a glass. So when all the vapours grey From our flowery paths shall flit, And the dawn begin the day, We will sing that song to it Ere its yellow fervour flies.â Oh, we are so glad of youth, Whose first sweetness never dies Nourished by eternal truth. THE MASTER SINGER A laughter in the diamond air, a music in the trembling grass; And one by one the words of light as joydrops through my being pass: âI am the sunlight in the heart, the silver moon-glow in the mind; My laughter runs and ripples through the wavy tresses of the wind. I am the fire upon the hills, the dancing flame that leads afar Each burning-hearted wanderer, and I the dear and homeward star. A myriad lovers died for me, and in their latest yielded breath I woke in glory giving them immortal life though touched by death. They knew me from the dawn of time: if Hermes beats his rainbow wings, If Angus shakes his locks of light, or golden-haired Apollo sings, It matters not the name, the land: my joy in all the gods abides: Even in the cricket in the grass some dimness of me smiles and hides. For joy of me the daystar glows, and in delight and wild desire The peacock twilight rays aloft its plumes and blooms of shadowy fire, Where in the vastness too I burn through summer nights and ages long, And with the fiery-footed watchers shake in myriad dance and song.â INHERITANCE As flow the rivers to the sea Adown from rocky hill or plain, A thousand ages toiled for thee And gave thee harvest of their gain; And weary myriads of yore Dug out for thee earth's buried ore. The shadowy toilers for thee fought In chaos of primeval day Blind battles with they knew not what; And each before he passed away Gave clear articulate cries of woe: Your pain is theirs of long ago. And all the old heart sweetness sung, The joyous life of man and maid In forests when the earth was young, In rumours round your childhood strayed: The careless sweetness of your mind Comes from the buried years behind. And not alone unto your birth Their gifts the weeping ages bore, The old descents of God on earth Have dowered thee with celestial lore: So, wise, and filled with sad and gay You pass unto the further day. IN AS MUCH . . . When for love it was fain of The wild heart was chidden, When the white limbs were clothed And the beauty was hidden; For the scorn that was done to The least of her graces, The Mother veiled over And hid from our faces The high soul of nature, The deep and the wonder, Her towers up in heaven, And the fairyland under. The Mother then whispered, âThe wrong done by thee To the least limb of beauty Was done unto me.â THE SEER Oh, if my spirit may foretell Or earlier impart, It is because I always dwell With morning in my heart. I feel the keen embrace of light Ere dawning on the view It sprays the chilly fold of night With iridescent dew. The robe of dust around it cast Hides not the earth below, Its heart of ruby flame, the vast Mysterious gloom and glow. Something beneath yon coward gaze Betrays the royal line; Its lust and hate, but errant rays, Are at their root divine. I hail the light of elder years Behind the niggard mould, The fiery kings, the seraph seers, As in the age of gold. And all about and through the gloom Breaths from the golden clime Are wafted like a sweet perfume From some most ancient time. A NEW BEING I know myself no more, my child, Since thou art come to me, Pity so tender and so wild Hath wrapped my thoughts of thee. These thoughts, a fiery gentle rain, Are from the Mother shed, Where many a broken heart hath lain And many a weeping head. LIGHT AND DARK Not the soul that's whitest Wakens love the sweetest: When the heart is lightest Oft the charm is fleetest. While the snow-frail maiden, Waits the time of learning, To the passion laden Turn with eager yearning. While the heart is burning Heaven with earth is banded: To the stars returning Go not empty-handed. Ah, the snow-frail maiden! Somehow truth has missed her, Left the heart unladen For its burdened sister. RECALL What call may draw thee back again, Lost dove, what art, what charm may please? The tender touch, the kiss, are vain, For thou wert lured away by these. Oh, must we use the iron hand, And mask with hate the holy breath, With alien voice give love's command, As they through love the call of death? A LEADER Though your eyes with tears were blind, Pain upon the path you trod: Well we knew, the hosts behind, Voice and shining of a god. For your darkness was our day: Signal fires, your pains untold Lit us on our wandering way To the mystic heart of gold. Naught we knew of the high land, Beauty burning in its spheres; Sorrow we could understand And the mystery told in tears. THE LAST HERO We laid him to rest with tenderness; Homeward we turned in the twilight's gold; We thought in ourselves with dumb distressâ All the story of earth is told. A beautiful word at the last was said: A great deep heart like the hearts of old Went forth; and the speaker had lost the thread, Or all the story of earth was told. The dust hung over the pale dry ways Dizzily fired with the twilight's gold, And a bitter remembrance blew in each face How all the story of earth was told. THE PAIN OF EARTH Does the earth grow grey with grief For her hero darling fled? Though her vales let fall no leaf, In our hearts her tears are shed. Still the stars laugh on above: Not to them her grief is said; Mourning for her hero love In our hearts the tears are shed. We her children mourn for him, Mourn the elder hero dead; In the twilight grey and dim In our hearts the tears are shed. UNCONSCIOUS The winds, the stars, and the skies though wrought By the heavenly King yet know it not; And man who moves in the twilight dim Feels not the love that encircles him, Though in heart, on bosom, and eyelids press Lips of an infinite tenderness, He turns away through the dark to roam Nor heeds the fire in his hearth and home. LOVE Ere I lose myself in the vastness and drowse myself with the peace, While I gaze on the light and the beauty afar from the dim homes of men, May I still feel the heart-pang and pity, loveties that I would not release; May the voices of sorrow appealing call me back to their succour again. Ere I storm with the tempest of power the thrones and dominions of old, Ere the ancient enchantment allure me to roam through the star-misty skies, I would go forth as one who has reaped well what harvest the earth may unfold; May my heart be o'erbrimmed with compassion; on my brow be the crown of the wise. I would go as the dove from the ark sent forth with wishes and prayers To return with the paradise blossoms that bloom in the Eden of light: When the deep star-chant of the seraphs I hear in the mystical airs, May I capture one tone of their joy for the sad ones discrowned in the night. Not alone, not alone would I go to my rest in the heart of the love: Were I tranced in the innermost beauty, the flame of its tenderest breath, I would still hear the cry of the fallen recalling me back from above, To go down to the side of the people who weep in the shadow of death. OM A MEMORY Faint grew the yellow buds of light Far flickering beyond the snows, As leaning o'er the shadowy white Morn glimmered like a pale primrose. Within an Indian vale below A child said âomâ with tender heart, Watching with loving eyes the glow In dayshine fade and night depart. The word which Brahma at his dawn Outbreathes and endeth at his night, Whose tide of sound so rolling on Gives birth to orbs of pearly light; And beauty, wisdom, love, and youth, By its enchantment gathered grow In agelong wandering to the truth, Through many a cycle's ebb and flow. And here the voice of earth was stilled, The child was lifted to the Wise: A strange delight his spirit filled, And Brahm looked from his shining eyes. INDIAN SONG Shadowy-petalled, like the lotus, loom the mountains with their snows: Through the sapphire Soma rising such a flood of glory throws As when first in yellow splendour Brahma from the Lotus rose. High above the darkening mounds where fade the fairy lights of day, All the tiny planet folk are waving us from far away; Thrilled by Brahma's breath they sparkle with the magic of the gay. Brahma, all alone in gladness, dreams the joys that throng in space, Shepherds all the whirling splendours onward to their resting place, Where in worlds of lovely silence fade in one the starry race. THE NUTS OF KNOWLEDGE A cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook Where door and windows open wide that friendly stars may look. The rabbit shy can patter in, the winds may enter free, Who throng around the mountain throne in living ecstasy. And when the sun sets dimmed in eve and purple fills the air, I think the sacred Hazel Tree is dropping berries there From starry fruitage waved aloft where Connla's Well o'erflows; For sure the enchanted waters run through every wind that blows. I think when night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew, How every high and lonely thought that thrills my being through Is but a ruddy berry dropped down through the purple air, And from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere. CHILDREN OF LIR We woke from our sleep in the bosom where cradled together we lay: The love of the dark hidden Father went with us upon our way. And gay was the breath in our being, and never a sorrow or fear Was on us as, singing together, we flew from the infinite Lir. Through nights lit with diamond and sapphire we raced with the children of dawn, A chain that was silver and golden linked spirit to spirit, my swan, Till day in the heavens passed over, and still grew the beat of our wings, And the breath of the darkness enfolded to teach us unspeakable things. Yet lower we fell and for comfort our pinionless spirits had now The leaning of bosom to bosom, the lifting of lip unto brow. Though chained to the earth yet we mourned not the loss of our heaven above, But passed from the vision of beauty to the fathomless being of love. Still gay is the breath in our being, we wait for the bell branch to ring To call us away to the Father, and then we will rise on the wing, And fly through the twilights of time till the home lights of heaven appear; Our spirits through love and through longing made one in the infinite Lir. PRAYER Let us leave our island woods grown dim and blue; O'er the waters creeping the pearl dust of the eve Hides the silver of the long wave rippling through: The chill for the warm room let us leave. Turn the lamp down low and draw the curtain wide, So the greyness of the starlight bathes the room; Let us see the giant face of night outside, Though vague as a moth's wing is the gloom. Rumour of the fierce-pulsed city far away Breaks upon the peace that aureoles our rest, Steeped in stillness as if some primeval day Hung drowsily o'er the water's breast. Shut the eyes that flame and hush the heart that burns: In quiet we may hear the old primeval cry: God gives wisdom to the spirit that upturns: Let us adore now, you and I. Age on age is heaped about us as we hear: Cycles hurry to and fro with giant tread From the deep unto the deep: but do not fear, For the soul unhearing them is dead. BENEDICTION Now the rooftree of the midnight spreading, Buds in citron, green, and blue: From afar its mystic odours shedding, Child, on you. Now the buried stars beneath the mountain And the vales their life renew, Jetting rainbow blooms from tiny fountains, Child, for you. In the diamond air the sun-star glowing, Up its feathered radiance threw; All the jewel glory there was flowing, Child, for you. As within the quiet waters passing, Sun and moon and stars we view, So the loveliness of life is glassing, Child, in you. And the fire divine in all things burning Seeks the mystic heart anew, From its wanderings far again returning, Child, to you. THE MID-WORLD This is the red, red region Your heart must journey through: Your pains will here be legion And joy be death for you. Rejoice to-day: to-morrow A turning tide shall flow Through infinite tones of sorrow To reach an equal woe. You pass by love unheeding To gain the goal you longâ But my heart, my heart is bleeding: I cannot sing this song. REMEMBRANCE There were many burning hours on the heartsweet tide, And we passed away from ourselves, forgetting all The immortal moods that faded, the god who died, Hastening away to the King on a distant call. There were ruby dews were shed when the heart was riven, And passionate pleading and prayers to the dead we had wronged; And we passed away, unremembering and unforgiven, Hastening away to the King for the peace we longed. Love unremembered and heart-ache we left behind, We forsook them, unheeding, hastening away in our flight; We knew the hearts we had wronged of old we would find When we came to the fold of the King for rest in the night. THE VISION OF LOVE The twilight fleeted away in pearl on the stream, And night, like a diamond dome, stood still in our dream. Your eyes like burnished stones or as stars were bright With the sudden vision that made us one with the night. We loved in infinite spaces, forgetting here The breasts that were lit with life and the lips so near; Till the wizard willows waved in the wind and drew Me away from the fulness of love and down to you. Our love was so vast that it filled the heavens up: But the soft white form I held was an empty cup, When the willows called me back to earth with their sigh, And we moved as shades through the deep that was you and I. THE CHRIST-SWORD The while my mad brain whirled around She only looked with eyes elate Immortal love at me. I found How deep the glance of love can wound, How cruel pity is to hate. I was begirt with hostile spears: My angel warred in me for you Whose gentle calmness all too fierce Made unseen lightnings to pierce My heart that dripped with ruddy dew. I know how on the final day The hosts of darkness meet with death: The angels with their love shall slay, Flowing to meet the dark array With terrible yet tender breath. BLINDNESS Our true hearts are forever lonely: A wistfulness is in our thought: Our lights are like the dawns which only Seem bright to us and yet are not. Something you see in me I wis not: Another heart in you I guess: A stranger's lipsâbut thine I kiss not, Erring in all my tenderness. I sometimes think a mighty lover Takes every burning kiss we give: His lights are those which round us hover: For him alone our lives we live. Ah, sigh for us whose hearts unseeing Point all their passionate love in vain, And blinded in the joy of being, Meet only when pain touches pain. WHOM WE WORSHIP I would not have the love of lips and eyes, The ancient ways of love: But in my heart I built a Paradise, A nest there for the dove. I felt the wings of light that fluttered through The gate I held apart: And all without was shadow, but I knew The bird within my heart. Then, while the innermost with music beat, The voice I loved so long Seemed only the dream echo faint and sweet Of a far sweeter song. I could not even bear the thought I felt Of Thee and Me therein; And with white heat I strove the veil to melt That love to love might win. But ah, my dreams within their fountain fell; Not to be lost in thee, But with the high ancestral love to dwell In its lone ecstasy. REFLECTIONS How shallow is this mere that gleams! Its depth of blue is from the skies, And from a distant sun the dreams And lovely light within your eyes. We deem our love so infinite Because the Lord is everywhere, And love awakening is made bright And bathed in that diviner air. We go on our enchanted way And deem our hours immortal hours, Who are but shadow kings that play With mirrored majesties and powers. THE MORNING STAR In the black pool of the midnight Lu has slung the morning star, And its foam in rippling silver whitens into day afar Falling on the mountain rampart piled with pearl above our glen, Only you and I, beloved, moving in the fields of men. In the dark tarn of my spirit, love, the morning star, is lit; And its halo, ever brightening, lightens into dawn in it. Love, a pearl-grey dawn in darkness, breathing peace without desire; But I fain would shun the burning terrors of the mid-day fire. Through the faint and tender airs of twilight star on star may gaze, But the eyes of light are blinded in the white flame of the days, From the heat that melts together oft a rarer essence slips, And our hearts may still be parted in the meeting of the lips. What a darkness would I gaze on when the day had passed the west, If my eyes were dazed and blinded by the whiteness of a breast? Never through the diamond darkness could I hope to see afar Where beyond the pearly rampart burned the purer evening star. ILLUSION What is the love of shadowy lips That know not what they seek or press, From whom the lure for ever slips And fails their phantom tenderness? The mystery and light of eyes That near to mine grow dim and cold; They move afar in ancient skies Mid flame and mystic darkness rolled. O beauty, as thy heart o'erflows In tender yielding unto me, A vast desire awakes and grows Unto forgetfulness of thee. THE DREAM I woke to find my pillow wet With tears for deeds deep hid in sleep. I knew no sorrow here, but yet The tears fell softly through the deep. Your eyes, your other eyes of dream, Looked at me through the veil of blank; I saw their joyous, starlit gleam Like one who watches rank on rank. His victor airy legions wind And pass before his awful throneâ Was there thy loving heart unkind, Was I thy captive all o'erthrown? MISTRUST You look at me with wan, bright eyes When in the deeper world I stray: You fear some hidden ambush lies In wait to call me, âCome away.â What if I see behind the veil Your starry self beseeching me, Or at its stern command grow pale, âLet her be free, let her be freeâ? ALIEN Dark glowed the vales of amethyst Beneath an opal shroud: The moon bud opened through the mist Its white-fire leaves of cloud. Though rapt at gaze with eyes of light Looked forth the seraph seers, The vast and wandering dream of night Rolled on above our tears. THE TIDE OF SORROW On the twilight-burnished hills I lie and long and gaze Where below the grey-lipped sands drink in the flowing tides, Drink, and fade and disappear: interpreting their ways A seer in my heart abides. Once the diamond dancing day-waves laved thy thirsty lips: Now they drink the dusky night-tide running cold and fleet, Drink, and as the chilly brilliance o'er their pallor slips They fade in the touch they meet. Wave on wave of pain where leaped of old the billowy joys: Hush and still thee now unmoved to drink the bitter sea, Drink with equal heart: be brave; and life with laughing voice And death will be one for thee. Ere my mortal days pass by and life in the world be done, Oh, to know what world shall rise within the spirit's ken When it grows into the peace where light and dark are one! What voice for the world of men? WEARINESS Where are now the dreams divine, Fires that lit the dawning soul, As the ruddy colours shine Through an opal aureole? Moving in a joyous trance, We were like the forest glooms Rumorous of old romance, Fraught with unimagined dooms. Titans we or morning stars, So we seemed in days of old, Mingling in the giant wars Fought afar in deeps of gold. God, an elder brother dear, Filled with kindly light our thought: Many a radiant form was near Whom our hearts remember not. Would they know us now? I think Old companions of the prime From our garments well might shrink, Muddied with the lees of Time. Fade the heaven-assailing moods: Slave to petty tasks I pine For the quiet of the woods, And the sunlight seems divine. And I yearn to lay my head Where the grass is green and sweet, Mother, all the dreams are fled From the tired child at thy feet. THE TWILIGHT OF EARTH The wonder of the world is o'er: The magic from the sea is gone: There is no unimagined shore, No islet yet to venture on. The Sacred Hazels' blooms are shed, The Nuts of Knowledge harvested. Oh, what is worth this lore of age If time shall never bring us back Our battle with the gods to wage Reeling along the starry track. The battle rapture here goes by In warring upon things that die. Let be the tale of him whose love Was sighed between white Deirdre's breasts, It will not lift the heart above The sodden clay on which it rests. Love once had power the gods to bring All rapt on its wild wandering. We shiver in the falling dew, And seek a shelter from the storm: When man these elder brothers knew He found the mother nature warm, A hearth fire blazing through it all, A home without a circling wall. We dwindle down beneath the skies, And from ourselves we pass away: The paradise of memories Grows ever fainter day by day. The shepherd stars have shrunk within, The world's great night will soon begin. Will no one, ere it is too late, Ere fades the last memorial gleam, Recall for us our earlier state? For nothing but so vast a dream That it would scale the steeps of air Could rouse us from so vast despair. The power is ours to make or mar Our fate as on the earliest morn, The Darkness and the Radiance are Creatures within the spirit born. Yet, bathed in gloom too long, we might Forget how we imagined light. Not yet are fixed the prison bars; The hidden light the spirit owns If blown to flame would dim the stars And they who rule them from their thrones: And the proud sceptred spirits thence Would bow to pay us reverence. Oh, while the glory sinks within Let us not wait on earth behind, But follow where it flies, and win The glow again, and we may find Beyond the Gateways of the Day Dominion and ancestral sway. THE GARDEN OF GOD Within the iron cities One walked unknown for years, In his heart the pity of pities That grew for human tears. When love and grief were ended The flower of pity grew. By unseen hands 't was tended And fed with holy dew. Though in his heart were barred in The blooms of beauty blown, Yet he who grew the garden Could call no flower his own. For by the hands that watered, The blooms that opened fair Through frost and pain were scattered To sweeten the dead air. A PRAYER O Holy Spirit of the Hazel, hearken now: Though shining suns and silver moons burn on the bough, And though the fruit of stars by many myriads gleam, Yet in the undergrowth below, still in thy dream, Lighting the monstrous maze and labyrinthine gloom Are many gem-winged flowers with gay and delicate bloom. And in the shade, hearken, O Dreamer of the Tree, One wild-rose blossom of thy spirit breathed on me With lovely and still light: a little sister flower To those that whitely on the tall moon-branches tower. Lord of the Hazel, now, O hearken while I pray. This wild-rose blossom of thy spirit fades away. A LAST COUNSEL Could you not in silence borrow Strength to go from us ungrieving? All these hours of loving sorrow Only make more bitter leaving. You will go forth lonely, thinking Of the pain you leave behind you; From the golden sunlight shrinking For the earthly tears will blind you. Better, ah, if now we parted For the little while remaining; You would seek when broken-hearted For the mighty heart's sustaining. You would go then gladly turning From our place of wounds and weeping, With your soul for comfort burning To the mother-bosom creeping. ORDEAL Love and pity are pleading with me this hour. What is this voice that stays me forbidding to yield, Offering beauty, love, and immortal power, Ãons away in some far-off heavenly field? Though I obey thee, Immortal, my heart is sore. Though love be withdrawn for love it bitterly grieves: Pity withheld in the breast makes sorrow more. Oh that the heart could feel what the mind believes! Cease, O love, thy fiery and gentle pleading. Soft is thy grief, but in tempest through me it rolls. Dream'st thou not whither the path is leading Where the Dark Immortal would shepherd our weeping souls? A FAREWELL Only in my deep heart I love you, sweetest heart. Many another vesture hath the soul, I pray Call me not forth from this. If from the light I part Only with clay I cling unto the clay. And ah! my bright companion, you and I must go Our ways, unfolding lonely glories, not our own, Nor from each other gathered, but an inward glow Breathed by the Lone One on the seeker lone. If for the heart's own sake we break the heart, we may When the last ruby drop dissolves in diamond light Meet in a deeper vesture in another day. Until that dawn, dear heart, good-night, good-night. THE VOICE OF THE SEA The sea was hoary, hoary, Beating on rock and cave: The winds were white and weeping With foam dust of the wave. They thundered louder, louder, With storm-lips curled in scornâ And dost thou tremble before us, O fallen star of morn? THE HOUR OF TWILIGHT When the unquiet hours depart And far away their tumults cease, Within the twilight of the heart We bathe in peace, are stilled with peace The fire that slew us through the day For angry deed or sin of sense Now is the star and homeward ray To us who bow in penitence. We kiss the lips of bygone pain And find a secret sweet in them: The thorns once dripped with shadowy rain Are bright upon each diadem. Ceases the old pathetic strife, The struggle with the scarlet sin: The mad enchanted laugh of life Tempts not the soul that sees within. No riotous and fairy song Allures the prodigals who bow Within the home of law, and throng Before the mystic Father now, Where faces of the elder years, High souls absolved from grief and sin, Leaning from out ancestral spheres Beckon the wounded spirit in. OUR THRONES DECAY I said my pleasure shall not move; It is not fixed in things apart: Seeking not loveâbut yet to loveâ I put my trust in mine own heart. I knew the fountain of the deep Wells up with living joy, unfed: Such joys the lonely heart may keep, And love grow rich with love unwed. Still flows the ancient fount sublime;â But, ah, for my heart, shed tears, shed tears; Not it, but love, has scorn of time; It turns to dust beneath the years. RECOLLECTION Through the blue shadowy valley I hastened in a dream: Flower rich the night, flower soft the air, a blue flower the stream I hurried over before I came to the cabin door, Where the orange flame-glow danced within on the beaten floor. And the lovely mother who drooped by the sleeping child arose: And I see how with love her eyes are glad, her face how it glows. And I know all this was past ten thousand years away, But in the Ever-Living yesterday is here today, And the beauty made dust we cry out for with so much pain. Unknown lover, I lived over your joy again. Long dead maiden, your breasts were warm for the living head. It is we who have passed from ourselves, from beauty which is not dead. I know, when I come to my own immortal, I will find there In a myriad instant all that the wandering soul found fair: Empires that never crumbled, and thrones all glorious yet, And hearts ere they were broken, and eyes ere they were wet. THE WELL OF ALL-HEALING There's a cure for sorrow in the well at Ballylee Where the scarlet cressets hang over the trembling pool: And joyful winds are blowing from the Land of Youth to me, And the heart of the earth is full. Many and many a sunbright maiden saw the enchanted land With star faces glimmer up from the druid wave: Many and many a pain of love was soothed by a faery hand Or lost in the love it gave. When the quiet with a ring of pearl shall wed the earth, And the scarlet berries burn dark by the stars in the pool; Oh, it's lost and deep I'll be amid the Danaan mirth, While the heart of the earth is full. A NEW THEME I fain would leave the tender songs I sang to you of old, Thinking the oft-sung beauty wrongs The magic never told. And touch no more the thoughts, the moods, That win the easy praise; But venture in the untrodden woods To carve the future ways. Though far or strange or cold appear The shadowy things I tell, Within the heart the hidden seer Knows and remembers well. I think that in the coming time The hearts and hopes of men The mountain tops of life shall climb, The gods return again. I strive to blow the magic horn; It feebly murmureth; Arise on some enchanted morn, Poet, with God's own breath! And sound the horn I cannot blow, And by the secret name Each exile of the heart will know Kindle the magic flame. THE FOUNTAIN OF SHADOWY BEAUTY A DREAM I would I could weave in The colour, the wonder, The song I conceive in My heart while I ponder, And show how it came like The magi of old Whose chant was a flame like The dawn's voice of gold; Whose dreams followed near them A murmur of birds, And ear still could hear them Unchanted in words. In words I can only Reveal thee my heart, Oh, Light of the Lonely, The shining impart. Between the twilight and the dark The lights danced up before my eyes. I found no sleep or peace or rest, But dreams of stars and burning skies. I knew the faces of the dayâ Dream faces, pale, with cloudy hair, I knew you not nor yet your home, The Fount of Shadowy Beauty, where? I passed a dream of gloomy ways Where ne'er did human feet intrude: It was the border of a wood, A dreadful forest solitude. With wondrous red and fairy gold The clouds were woven o'er the ocean; The stars in fiery Ã¦ther swung And danced with gay and glittering motion. A fire leaped up within my heart When first I saw the old sea shine; As if a god were there revealed I bowed my head in awe divine; And long beside the dim sea marge I mused until the gathering haze Veiled from me where the silver tide Ran in its thousand shadowy ways. The black night dropped upon the sea: The silent awe came down with it: I saw fantastic vapours flee As o'er the darkness of the pit. When lo! from out the furthest night A speck of rose and silver light Above a boat shaped wondrously Came floating swiftly o'er the sea. It was no human will that bore The boat so fleetly to the shore Without a sail spread or an oar. The Pilot stood erect thereon And lifted up his ancient face, Ancient with glad eternal youth Like one who was of starry race. His face was rich with dusky bloom; His eyes a bronze and golden fire; His hair in streams of silver light Hung flamelike on his strange attire, Which, starred with many a mystic sign, Fell as o'er sunlit ruby glowing: His light flew o'er the waves afar In ruddy ripples on each bar Along the spiral pathways flowing. It was a crystal boat that chased The light along the watery waste, Till caught amid the surges hoary The Pilot stayed its jewelled glory. Oh, never such a glory was: The pale moon shot it through and through With light of lilac, white and blue: And there mid many a fairy hue, Of pearl and pink and amethyst, Like lightning ran the rainbow gleams And wove around a wonder-mist. The Pilot lifted beckoning hands; Silent I went with deep amaze To know why came this Beam of Light So far along the ocean ways Out of the vast and shadowy night. âMake haste, make haste!â he cried. âAway! A thousand ages now are gone. Yet thou and I ere night be sped Will reck no more of eve or dawn.â Swift as the swallow to its nest I leaped: my body dropt right down: A silver star I rose and flew. A flame burned golden at his breast: I entered at the heart and knew My Brother-Self who roams the deep, Bird of the wonder-world of sleep. The ruby vesture wrapped us round As twain in one; we left behind The league-long murmur of the shore And fleeted swifter than the wind. The distance rushed upon the bark: We neared unto the mystic isles: The heavenly city we could mark, Its mountain light, its jewel dark, Its pinnacles and starry piles. The glory brightened: âDo not fear; For we are real, though what seems So proudly built above the waves Is but one mighty spirit's dreams. âOur Father's house hath many fanes; Yet enter not and worship not, For thought but follows after thought Till last consuming self it wanes. âThe Fount of Shadowy Beauty flings Its glamour o'er the light of day: A music in the sunlight sings To call the dreamy hearts away Their mighty hopes to ease awhile: We will not go the way of them: The chant makes drowsy those who seek The sceptre and the diadem. âThe Fount of Shadowy Beauty throws Its magic round us all the night; What things the heart would be, it sees And chases them in endless flight. Or coiled in phantom visions there It builds within the halls of fire; Its dreams flash like the peacock's wing And glow with sun-hues of desire. We will not follow in their ways Nor heed the lure of fay or elf, But in the ending of our days Rest in the high Ancestral Self.â The boat of crystal touched the shore, Then melted flamelike from our eyes, As in the twilight drops the sun Withdrawing rays of paradise. We hurried under archÃ©d aisles That far above in heaven withdrawn With cloudy pillars stormed the night, Rich as the opal shafts of dawn. I would have lingered thenâbut he: âOh, let us haste: the dream grows dim, Another night, another day, A thousand years will part from him, Who is that Ancient One divine From whom our phantom being born Rolled with the wonder-light around Had started in the fairy morn. âA thousand of our years to him Are but the night, are but the day, Wherein he rests from cyclic toil Or chants the song of starry sway. He falls asleep: the Shadowy Fount Fills all our heart with dreams of light: He wakes to ancient spheres, and we Through iron ages mourn the night. We will not wander in the night But in a darkness more divine Shall join the Father Light of Lights And rule the long-descended line.â Even then a vasty twilight fell: Wavered in air the shadowy towers: The city like a gleaming shell, Its azures, opals, silvers, blues, Were melting in more dreamy hues. We feared the falling of the night And hurried more our headlong flight In one long line the towers went by; The trembling radiance dropt behind, As when some swift and radiant one Flits by and flings upon the wind The rainbow tresses of the sun. And then they vanished from our gaze Faded the magic lights, and all Into a starry radiance fell As waters in their fountain fall. We knew our time-long journey o'er And knew the end of all desire, And saw within the emerald glow Our Father like the white sun-fire. We could not say if age or youth Were on his face: we only burned To pass the gateways of the day, The exiles to the heart returned. He rose to greet us and his breath, The tempest music of the spheres, Dissolved the memory of earth, The cyclic labour and our tears. In him our dream of sorrow passed, The spirit once again was free And heard the song the morning stars Chant in eternal revelry. This was the close of human story; We saw the deep unmeasured shine, And sank within the mystic glory They called of old the Dark Divine. Well it is gone now, The dream that I chanted: On this side the dawn now I sit fate-implanted. But though of my dreaming The dawn has bereft me, It all was not seeming For something has left me. I feel in some other World far from this cold light The Dream Bird, my brother, Is rayed with the gold light. I too in the Father Would hide me, and so, Bright Bird, to foregather With thee now I go. THE FEAST OF AGE See where the light streams over Connla's fountain Starward aspire! The sacred sign upon the holy mountain Shines in white fire: Wavering and flaming yonder o'er the snows The diamond light Melts into silver or to sapphire glows, Night beyond night: And from the heaven of heaven descends on earth A dew divine. Come, let us mingle in the starry mirth Around the shrine. O earth, enchantress, mother, to our home In thee we press, Thrilled by thy fiery breath and wrapt in some Vast tenderness. The homeward birds, uncertain o'er their nest Wheel in the dome, Fraught with dim dreams of more enraptured rest, Another home. But gather ye, to whose undarkened eyes Night is as day, Leap forth, immortals, birds of paradise, In bright array, Robed like the shining tresses of the sun, And by his name Call from his haunt divine the ancient one, Our father flame. Aye, from the wonder light, heart of our star, Come now, come now. Sun-breathing spirit, ray thy lights afar: Thy children bow, Hush with more awe the heart; the bright-browed races Are nothing worth, By those dread gods from out whose awful faces The earth looks forth Infinite pity set in calm, whose vision cast Adown the years Beholds how beauty burns away at last Their children's tears. Now while our hearts the ancient quietness Floods with its tide, The things of air and fire and height no less In it abide; And from their wanderings over sea and shore They rise as one Unto the vastness, and with us adore The midnight sun, And enter the innumerable All And shine like gold, And starlike gleam in the immortal's hall, The heavenly fold, And drink the sun-breaths from the mother's lips Awhile, and then Fail from the light and drop in dark eclipse To earth again, Roaming along by heaven-hid promontory And valley dim, Weaving a phantom image of the glory They knew in Him. Out of the fulness flow the winds, their song Is heard no more, Or hardly breathes a mystic sound along The dreamy shore, Blindly they move, unknowing as in trance; Their wandering Is half with us, and half an inner dance, Led by the King. GLORY AND SHADOW Shadow Who art thou, O Glory, In flame from the deep Where stars chant their story; Why trouble my sleep? I hardly had rested; My dreams wither now. Why comest thou crested And gemmed on thy brow? Glory Up, Shadow, and follow The way I will show: The blue gleaming hollow To-night we shall know: And rise through the vast to The fountain of days From whence we had passed to The parting of ways. Shadow I know thee, O Glory; Thine eyes and thy brow With white-fire all hoary Come back to me now. Together we wandered In ages agone: Our thoughts as we pondered Were stars at the dawn. My glory has dwindled, My azure and gold: Yet you keep unkindled The sunfire of old. My footsteps are tied to The heath and the stone: My thoughts earth-allied-to, Ah, leave me alone. Go back, thou of gladness, Nor wound me with pain, Nor smite me with madness, Nor come nigh again. Glory Why tremble and weep now, Whom stars once obeyed? Come forth to the deep now And be not afraid. The Dark One is calling I know, for his dreams Around me are falling In musical streams. A diamond is burning In depths of the lone, Thy spirit returning May claim for its throne. In flame-fringÃ¨d islands Its sorrow shall cease, Absorbed in the silence And quenched in the peace. Come lay thy poor head on My heart where it glows With love ruby-red on Thy heart for its woes. My power I surrender; To thee it is due. Come forth! for the splendour Is waiting for you. THE ROBING OF THE KING On the bird of air blue-breasted glint the rays of gold, And its shadowy fleece above us waves the forest old, Far through rumorous leagues of midnight stirred by breezes warm. See the old ascetic yonder, ah, poor withered form, Where he crouches wrinkled over by unnumbered years Through the leaves the flakes of moon-fire fall like phantom tears. At the dawn a kingly hunter swept in proud disdain, Like a rainbow torrent scattered flashed his royal train. Now the lonely one unheeded seeks earth's caverns dim: Never king or prince will robe them radiantly as him 'Mid the deep enfolding darkness follow him, O seer, Where the arrow will is piercing fiery sphere on sphere, Through the blackness leaps and sparkles gold and amethyst, Curling, jetting, and dissolving in a rainbow mist. In the jewel glow and lunar radiance rises there One, a morning star in beauty, young, immortal, fair: Sealed in heavy sleep, the spirit leaves its faded dress, Unto fiery youth returning out of weariness. Music as for one departing, joy as for a king, Sound and swell, and hark! above him cymbals triumphing. Fire, an aureole encircling, suns his brow with gold, Like to one who hails the morning on the mountains old. Open mightier vistas, changing human loves to scorns, And the spears of glory pierce him like a crown of thorns. High and yet more high to freedom as a bird he springs, And the aureole outbreathing, gold and silver wings Plume the brow and crown the seraph: soon his journey done He will pass our eyes that follow, sped beyond the sun. None may know the mystic radiance, King, will there be thine, Far beyond the light enfolded in the dark divine. A CALL OF THE SIDHE Tarry thou yet, late lingerer in the twilight's glory: Gay are the hills with song: earth's faery children leave More dim abodes to roam the primrose-hearted eve, Opening their glimmering lips to breathe some wondrous story. Hush, not a whisper! Let your heart alone go dreaming. Dream unto dream may pass: deep in the heart alone Murmurs the Mighty One his solemn undertone. Canst thou not see adown the silver cloudland streaming Rivers of faery light, dewdrop on dewdrop falling, Star-fire of silver flames, lighting the dark beneath? And what enraptured hosts burn on the dusky heath! Come thou away with them for Heaven to Earth is calling. These are Earth's voiceâher answerâspirits thronging. Come to the Land of Youth: the trees grown heavy there Drop on the purple wave the starry fruit they bear. Drink: the immortal waters quench the spirit's longing. Art thou not now, bright one, all sorrow past, in elation, Made young with joy, grown brother-hearted with the vast, Whither thy spirit wending flits the dim stars past Unto the Light of Lights in burning adoration ON A HILLSIDE A friendly mountain I know; As I lie on the green slope there It sets my heart in a glow And closes the door on care. A thought I try to frameâ I was with you long ago; My soul from your heart out-came; Mountain, is that not so? Take me again, dear hills, Open the door to me Where the magic murmur thrills The halls I do not see, The halls and caverns deep; Though sometimes I may dare Down the twilight stairs of sleep To meet the kingly there. Sometimes on flaming wings I sit upon a throne And watch how the great star swings Along the sapphire zone. It has wings of its own for flight, Diamond its pinions strong, Glories of opal and white, I watch the whole night long. Until I needs must lay My royal robes aside To toil in a world of grey, Grey shadows by my side. And when I ponder it o'er Grey memories only bide, But their fading lips tell more Than all the world beside. A RETURN We turned back mad from the mystic mountains, All foamed with red and with elfin gold: Up from the heart of the twilight's fountains The fires enchanted were starward rolled. We turned back mad: we thought of the morrow, The iron clang of the far-away town: We could not weep in our bitter sorrow, But joy as an Arctic sun went down. THE CHILD OF DESTINY This is the hero-heart of the enchanted isle, Whom now the twilight children tenderly enfold, Pat with their pearly palms and crown with elfin gold, While in the mountain's breast his brothers watch and smile. Who now of Dana's host may guide these dancing feet? What bright immortal hides and through a child's light breath Laughs an immortal joyâAngus of love and death Returned to make our hearts with dream and music beat? Or Lu leaves heavenly wars to free his ancient land; Not on the fiery steed maned with tumultuous flame As in the Fomor days the sunbright chieftain came, But in this dreaming boy, more subtle conquest planned. Or does the Mother brood some deed of sacrifice? Her heart in his laid bare to hosts of wounding spears, Till love immortal melt the cruel eyes to tears, Or on his brow be set the heroes' thorny prize. See! as some shadows of a darker race draw near, How he compels their feet, with what a proud command! What is it waves and gleams? Is that a Silver Hand Whose light through delicate lifted fingers shines so clear? Night like a glowing seraph o'er the kingly boy Watches with ardent eyes from his own ancient home; And far away, rocking in living foam The three great waves leap up exulting in their joy, Remembering the past, the immemorial deeds The Danaan gods had wrought in guise of mortal men, Their elemental hearts madden with life again, And shaking foamy heads toss the great ocean steeds. MAGIC AFTER READING THE UPANISHADS Out of the dusky chamber of the brain Flows the imperial will through dream on dream: The fires of life around it tempt and gleam; The lights of earth behind it fade and wane. Passed beyond beauty tempting dream on dream, The pure will seeks the heart-hold of the light: Sounds the deep OM, the mystic word of might: Forth from the heart-hold breaks the living stream. Passed out beyond the deep heart music-filled, The kingly will sits on the ancient throne, Wielding the sceptre, fearless, free, alone, Knowing in Brahma all it dared and willed. BREAGHY When twilight flutters the mountains over, The faery lights from the earth unfold: And over the caves enchanted hover The giant heroes and gods of old. The bird of Ã¦ther its flaming pinions Waves over earth the whole night long: The stars drop down in their blue dominions To hymn together their choral song. The child of earth in his heart grows burning, Mad for the night and the deep unknown; His alien flame in a dream returning Seats itself on the ancient throne. When twilight over the mountains fluttered, And night with its starry millions came, I too had dreams: the songs I have uttered Come from this heart that was touched by the flame. A FAREWELL I go down from the hills half in gladness, and half with a pain I depart, Where the Mother with gentlest breathing made music on lip and in heart; For I know that my childhood is over: a call comes out of the vast, And the love that I had in the old time, like beauty in twilight, is past. I am fired by a Danaan whisper of battles afar in the world, And my thought is no longer of peace, for the banners in dream are unfurled, And I pass from the council of stars and of hills to a life that is new: And I bid to you stars and you mountains a tremulous long adieu. I will come once again as a master, who played here as child in my dawn I will enter the heart of the hills where the gods of the old world are gone. And will war like the bright Hound of Ulla with princes of earth and of sky. For my dream is to conquer the heavens and battle for kingship on high. ON BEHALF OF SOME IRISHMEN NOT FOLLOWERS OF TRADITION They call us aliens, we are told, Because our wayward visions stray From that dim banner they unfold, The dreams of worn-out yesterday. The sum of all the past is theirs, The creeds, the deeds, the fame, the name, Whose death-created glory flares And dims the spark of living flame. They weave the necromancer's spell, And burst the graves where martyrs slept, Their ancient story to retell, Renewing tears the dead have wept. And they would have us join their dirge, This worship of an extinct fire In which they drift beyond the verge Where races all outworn expire. The worship of the dead is not A worship that our hearts allow, Though every famous shade were wrought With woven thorns above the brow. We fling our answer back in scorn: âWe are less children of this clime Than of some nation yet unborn Or empire in the womb of time. We hold the Ireland in the heart More than the land our eyes have seen, And love the goal for which we start More than the tale of what has been.â The generations as they rise May live the life men lived before, Still hold the thought once held as wise, Go in and out by the same door. We leave the easy peace it brings: The few we are shall still unite In fealty to unseen kings Or unimaginable light. We would no Irish sign efface, But yet our lips would gladlier hail The firstborn of the Coming Race Than the last splendour of the Gael. No blazoned banner we unfoldâ One charge alone we give to youth, Against the sceptred myth to hold The golden heresy of truth. AN IRISH FACE Not her own sorrow only that hath place Upon yon gentle face. Too slight have been her childhood's years to gain The imprint of such pain. It hid behind her laughing hours, and wrought Each curve in saddest thought On brow and lips and eyes. With subtle art It made that little heart Through its young joyous beatings to prepare A quiet shelter there, Where the immortal sorrows might find a home. And many there have come; Bowed in a mournful mist of golden hair Deirdre hath entered there. And shrouded in a fall of pitying dew, Weeping the friend he slew, The Hound of Ulla lies, with those who shed Tears for the Wild Geese fled. And all the lovers on whom fate had warred Cutting the silver cord Enter, and softly breath by breath they mould The young heart to the old, The old protest, the old pity, whose power Are gathering to the hour When their knit silence shall be mightier far Than leagued empires are. And dreaming of the sorrow on this face We grow of lordlier race, Could shake the rooted rampart of the hills To shield her from all ills, And through a deep adoring pity won Grow what we dream upon. ON THE WATERS Our boat drifts in the heart of heat, In starry dances plays the light; Above the wave our glances meet The warmest world of blue and bright. At harmony are sky and sea; Your face shines on me young and gay, And life has given all to me That heart could wish this happy day. Yet I have grown so sudden old Your laughter sounds afar. I seem As one who wakening tries to hold A figure that he loved in dream, And feels it lost beyond recall In worlds unconquerable; so I Am in an instant rapt from all: I might be veiled within the sky. The clouds swim in the heavenly blue And still I see the waters shine, In tender tones a name floats to A vanished self that once was mine. They thrill me not, I know not how The lips but late so sweetly kissed. A love more ancient draws me now To keep some immemorial tryst. Is love unbounded then so high The love that woke it may not win, When grown to fulness it must fly And seek its own immortal kin? Who are my kinsmen in the vast? And shall I in this soundless calm Find recompense for all the past, Be nearer unto what I am? Have you like me behind the veil A self so mystic and so cold, And if we could each other hail Would all the pallor glow to gold? Speak, for although I have the sense Of destinies about me piled And yet unveiled magnificence, I feel but as a little child, Or one the grave no longer owns, Whose spirit breaks above the sods, Is overlooked from awful thrones And crouches at the feet of gods, Nor sees nor hears he with bowed head The judgment of the shining ring, Nor what high doom at length is said And echoed back from king to king. The doom is spoken. It may be That I shall never more forget In all my thoughts of thee and me The maya wherein life is set, This wizardry shall still pursue All things we had found firm or fair, Till life itself seem frail as dew Or bubble glistening on the air. Your eyes hold mine once more. Your face Again allures. Oh, let us fly! There is some magic in this place Would mar the dream of You and I. Come, let us bend unto the oar, Pull swift, beloved, there may be Safe home on that far glimmering shore; Oh! fly from the enchanted sea! GODS OF WAR 1914 Fate wafts us from the pygmies' shore: We swim beneath the epic skies: A Rome and Carthage war once more, And wider empires are the prize; Where the beaked galleys clashed; lo, these Our iron dragons of the seas! High o'er the cloudy battle sweep The winged chariots in their flight: The steely creatures of the deep Cleave the dark waters' ancient night: Below, above, in wave, in air, New worlds for conquest everywhere. More terrible than spear or sword Those stars that burst with fiery breath: More loud the battle cries are poured Along a hundred leagues of death. So do they fight. How have ye warred, Defeated Armies of the Lord? This is the Dark Immortal's hour, His victory, whoever fail; His prophets have not lost their power: CÃ¦sar and Attila prevail. These are your legions still, proud ghosts, These myriad embattled hosts. How wanes Thine empire, Prince of Peace! With the fleet circling of the suns The ancient gods their power increase; Lo, how Thine own anointed ones Make holy all Thy soul abhorred, The hate on which Thy love had warred. Who dreamed a dream mid outcasts born Could overbrow the pride of kings? They pour on Christ the ancient scorn. His Dove its gold and silver wings Has spread. Perhaps it nests in flame In outcasts who abjure His name. Choose ye your rightful gods, nor pay Lip reverence that the heart denies. O Nations, is not Zeus to-day, The thunderer from the epic skies, More than the Prince of Peace? Is Thor Not nobler for a world at war? They fit the dreams of power we hold, Those gods whose names are with us still, Men in their image made of old The high companions of their will. Who build in air an empire's prideâ Would they pray to the Crucified? O outcast Christ, it was too soon For flags of battle to be furled While life was yet at the hot noon. Come in the twilight of the world: Its kings may greet Thee without scorn And crown Thee then without a thorn. BATTLE ARDOUR Unto what heaven wends this wild ecstasy? Is the fired spirit light upon its wings, Self being outcast, as the diver flings His garment so that every limb be free? Is it an instant of eternity Attained because no earthly terror clings? Not now it battles for the rights of kings. This ecstasy is all its own; to be Quit of itself, mounted upon the power That, like Leviathan, breaks from the deep Primeval and all conquering. He dies! Yet has he conquered in that very hour. He and his foeman the same tryst do keep. His foemen are his brothers in the skies. CONTINUITY No sign is made while empires pass. The flowers and stars are still His care, The constellations hid in grass, The golden miracles in air. Life in an instant will be rent Where death is glittering blind and wildâ The Heavenly Brooding is intent To that last instant on Its child. It breathes the glow in brain and heart, Life is made magical. Until Body and spirit are apart The Everlasting works Its will. In that wild orchid that your feet In their next falling shall destroy, Minute and passionate and sweet The Mighty Master holds His joy. Though the crushed jewels droop and fade The Artist's labours will not cease, And of the ruins shall be made Some yet more lovely masterpiece. ARES I saw in dream our mighty hunter ride Like one distraught, and maddening where he trod, Trampling to dust the cities of our pride, And yet he seemed a god. He gloomed above me with his famished eyes, With thorns, a fiery circlet, round his head. His robes had broken hearts for broideries And trailed in liquid red. And on my fear he cast a scornful gaze: âI, once the King, am outcast of the soul. A thing of dread, I follow on your ways Till time has made you whole. âI was the fire that sped you forth to hunt The monstrous life that coiled in fen or wave, The fearless joy that went with you to front The dragon in its cave. âI was the might that made you unafraid, Will that upheld you till the earth was won, That met the wild colossi undismayed, Mammoth or mastodon. âMine was the strength laid bare the treasures hid Beneath the bones of earth; and builded wide, Blazoned with gold, the huge squat pyramid For Kings I deified; âAnd speared the sky with heaven-assailing towers, Pointing the starry thrones we yet might win; But that you turned and chose the easeful powers To dwell with you therein. âIn lovely idleness the days were sped With Beauty in her garden murmuring low. I was outcast, and to the desert fled To raise the whirlwind so: âAnd hurled against your gates the desert folk Whose sceptre was the scourge, their law a chain, That you might yet, stung by the bitter yoke, Grow unto power again. âKing have I been and foe in ages past. None may escape me. I am foe until There shall be for the spirit forged at last The high unshakeable will. âMy kindred are they, beauty, wisdom, love; But without me are none may dare to climb To the Ancestral Light that glows above Its mirrored lights in Time. âFear! I will rend you. Love! I make you strong. Wed with my might the beautiful and wise, We shall go forth at last, a Titan throng, To storm His Paradise.â FOREBODING Why do these tragic fancies throng About the subject of my song, Whose heart and lips, twin fountains, spray A foam of fancies ever gay? Oh, tell me, why should eyes be wet In musing upon Margaret? Why is the dream of her allied With empires humbled in their pride? Why should I see this face of flowers Mid cities with their burning towers? Why should a thorny crown be set Above the brows of Margaret? Who breathe too long the golden airs Must wrestle after with despairs. We warred with elemental powers While you have come a way of flowers. Your feet are all unstained, but yet Your feet have strayed, O Margaret. Beauty and strength as creatures roam Athirst for their eternal home, Yet come they singly unallied The heavenly city is denied. Till loveliness and power are met, No heaven for you, poor Margaret. How could you tame, so slight and fair, The burning dragon of the air, Till queened amid its awful wings They bear you to the King of Kings? Such high adventures are not set For frailty, gay Margaret. So many glories passed away, Rome, Babylon, and Nineveh; Their beauty kept a lonely heart From the dim underworld apart, And by barbaric hosts beset They fell as you shall, Margaret. Yet still you might the kingdom claim Without the martyrdom and shame, Could you but seek of your accord That other angel of the Lord, Hold out the hands when you have met, The way is pity, Margaret. CHIVALRY I dreamed I saw that ancient Irish queen, Who from her dun, as dawn had opened wide, Saw the tall foemen rise on every side, And gazed with kindling eye upon the scene, And in delight cried, âNoble is their mien.â âMost kingly are they,â her own host replied, Praising the beauty, bravery, and pride As if the foe their very kin had been. And then I heard the innumerable hiss Of human adders, nation with poisonous breath Spitting at nation, as if the dragon rage Would claw the spirit, and I woke at this, Knowing the soul of man was sick to death And I was weeping in the Iron Age. SHADOWS AND LIGHTS What gods have met in conflict to arouse This whirling shadow of invisible things, These hosts that writhe amid the shattered sods? O Father, and O Mother of the Gods, Is there some trouble in the heavenly house? We who are captained by its unseen kings Wonder what thrones are shaken in the skies, What powers who held dominion o'er our will Let fall the sceptre, and what destinies The younger gods may drive us to fulfil. Have they not swayed us, earth's invisible lords, With whispers and with breathings from the dark? The very border-stones of nations mark Where silence swallowed some wild prophet's words That rang but for an instant and were still, Yet were so burthened with eternity, They maddened all who heard to work their will, To raise the lofty temple on the hill. And many a glittering thicket of keen swords Flashed out to make one law for land and sea, That earth might move with heaven in company. The cities that to myriad beauty grew Were altars raised unto old gods who died, And they were sacrificed in ruins to The younger gods who took their place of pride; They have no brotherhood, the deified, No high companionship of throne by throne, But will their beauty still to be alone. What is a nation but a multitude United by some god-begotten mood, Some hope of liberty or dream of power That have not with each other brotherhood But warred in spirit from their natal hour, Their hatred god-begotten as their love Reverberations of eternal strife? For all that fury breathed in human life, Are ye not guilty, answer, ye above? Ah, no, the circle of the heavenly ones, That ring of burning, grave, inflexible powers, Array in harmony amid the deep The golden legionaries of the suns, That through their day from dawn to twilight keep The peace of heaven, and have no feuds like ours, The Morning Stars their labours of the dawn Close at the advent of the Solar Kings, And these with joy their sceptres yield, withdrawn When the still Evening Stars begin their reign, And twilight time is thrilled with homing wings To the All-Father Being turned again. No, not on high begin divergent ways, The galaxies of interlinked lights Rejoicing on each other's beauty gaze, 'Tis we who do make errant all the rays That stream upon us from the astral heights, Love in our thickened air too redly burns; And unto vanity our beauty turns; Wisdom, that gently whispers us to part From evil, swells to hatred in the heart. Dark is the shadow of invisible things On us who look not up, whose vision fails. The glorious shining of the heavenly kings To mould us to their image naught avails. They weave a robe of many-coloured fire To garb the spirits moving in the deep, And in the upper air its splendours keep Pure and unsullied, but below it trails Darkling and glimmering in our earthly mire. Our eyes are ever earthward. We are swayed But by the shadows of invisible light, And shadow against shadow is arrayed So that one dark may dominate the night. Though kinsmen are the lights that cast the shade, We look not up, nor see how, side by side, The high originals of all our pride In crowned and sceptred brotherhood are throned, Compassionate of our blindness and our hate That own the godship but the love disowned. Ah, let us for a little while abate The outward roving eye, and seek within Where spirit unto spirit is allied; There, in our inmost being, we may win The joyful vision of the heavenly wise To see the beauty in each other's eyes. APOCALYPTIC 1915 Our world beyond a year of dread Has paled like Babylon or Rome. Never for all the blood was shed Shall life return to it as home. No peace shall e'er that dream recall; The avalanche is yet to fall. Laugh, you whose dreams were outlawed things. The sceptre from the tyrant slips. Earth's kings are met by those wild kings Who swept through the Apocalypse. Ere the first awful hand be stayed, The second shall have clutched the blade. On the white horse is one who rides Until earth's empires are o'erthrown, And a red rider yet abides Whose trumpet call is still unblown, Whose battlefield shall be the grave Either for master or for slave. Once in a zodiac of years Earth stirs beneath her heaving crust, And high and low, unheeding tears, Are equal levelled with the dust. Laugh, slave, the coming terror brings Thee to that brotherhood with kings. Laugh too, you warriors of God, The tyrants of the spirit fail. The mitred head shall no more nod And multitudes of men be pale. When empires topple here below The heavens which are their shadows go. If the black horse's rider reign, Or the pale horse's rider fire His burning arrows, with disdain Laugh. You have come to your desire, To the last test which yields the right To walk amid the halls of light. You, who have made of earth your star, Cry out, indeed, for hopes made vain: For only those can laugh who are The strong Initiates of Pain, Who know that mighty god to be Sculptor of immortality. TRAGEDY This, of all fates, would be the saddest end; That that heroic fever, with its cry From Children unto Mother, âHere am I!â Should lose the very faith it would defend; That the high soul through passion should descend To work the evil it had willed must die. If it won so, would that be victory, That tragic close? Oh, hearken, foe or friend! Love, the magician, and the wizard Hate, Though one be like white fire and one dark flame, Work the same miracle, and all are wrought Into the image that they contemplate. None ever hated in the world but came To every baseness of the foe he fought. STATESMEN They tell us that they war on war. Why do they treat our wit with scorn? The dragon from the dragon seed, the breed was true since life was born. When has the lioness conceived the lamb beneath her tawny side? When has the timid dove been born the offspring of the eagle's pride? When Cherubim smite at their Light, oh! yes, we may believe this thing. When Eblis risen in revolt casts from its shades their awful king. We know how from the deeds men do a sudden blackness blinds the soul, How kindled by their sacrifice lights up the instant aureole. The thought, the deed, breed always true. Shall nations not the law obey? Has not the Mighty Father store within His Treasure House to pay? The noble and the base beget their kin, and empires ere they pass See their own mirrored majesty arise within Time's looking-glass. The pride that builded Babylon of Egypt was the mighty child: The beauty of the Attic soul in many a lovely city smiled. The empire that is built in pride shall call imperial pride to birth, And with that shadow of itself must fight for empire of the earth. Fight where ye will on earth or sea, beneath the wave, above the hills, The foe ye meet is still yourselves, the blade ye forged the sword that kills. TO THE NEW GODS You, who now wield by earthly right The sceptres God-conferred of old, Who know no law above your might, No sceptre higher than you hold: We pray you in the ancient words, Have pity on the people, lords! The kings who ruled us from the skies For righteousness as tribute cried: Your wrath demands more sacrifice For word or deed that vexed your pride, Our manhood to the battle flings. Have mercy on us, mighty kings! Whom shall we pray to now to give The daily bread for us and ours, For by ourselves we cannot live? Hear, we beseech you, awful powers, For blood of kin in payment shed, Give us this day our daily bread! You take the father and the son, The brother and the kin away. We can but cry, âThy will be done,â As to the gods of yesterday. When childhood is bereft of all, Will you be Father at its call? The elder masters of our fate Proclaimed a heaven above the stars. You shadow forth the earthly state. Forgive, O iron avatars, Our fear the prayer âThy kingdom come,â Invokes some myriad martyrdom. Yea, you are power before our eyes; The love divine we took on trust. What life you will we but surmise And recreate ourselves in dust, Like those too hopeless to deceive, Who also tremble and believe. The King of Kings made fair the earth; The feast of life was nobly set. The summons to that regal mirth We would not hear or did forget. Sadly He said, âLove would not win, The iron hand must draw them in.â Spare us, stern ministers of law, A little, while we do repent, Ere the grim state all life shall draw Unto the feast of punishment, The brotherhood that might compels, The deepest of the human hells. ICICLES This fragile witchery of frost, This stillness in the steely sky, So strange, so cold, to us, the lost, How seems it to the King on high? Is He too frozen in His dream? So chilly seems the violet hill, So white the fields without a gleam Where writhes the iron-coloured rill, So icy frigid is the day, It might be all the thought of one Who had long lost the heavenly way That leads unto the central sun. THE STONE AGE A FANCY The sun is sultry o'er the marble lands, Whose milky glimmer branched with glowing gold, Runs downward to the sea's edge, where untold Ages the waves with gently lapping hands Wash into first discoverable sands The jewelled margin. Round I turn and hold Within my gaze the shade of forests old. Each jagged trunk of rock, no wind moves, stands, And shafts of stony blueness sends far out Where twinkle starlike blossoms crystalline, If on their pink profusion the sun slants. Beneath the merry children dance and shout, And on me one whom beauty makes divine Looks with an innocent and curious glance. INVISIBLE KINGS I watched all day the sway of invisible kings, The fingers of Air that fondled the murmuring tide, And shaped it to jewels of spray and delicate things, And it yielded to Air as yields to her lover a bride. I saw where the sceptre of Light was laid on our star, How colour in torrents foamed from the peak up on high, And flooded the glades, and ran through the forests afar, And the lanes were silver and golden as dawn passed by. In the watches of night I felt a mightier King, In the silence that lies below life, invisible, still. But my thoughts that were dark were made gay as birds on the wing, As with Wind in the waters, or sceptre of Light on the hill. IN CONNEMARA With eyes all untroubled she laughs as she passes, Bending beneath the creel with the seaweed brown, Till evening with pearl dew dims the shining grasses And night lit with dreamlight enfolds the sleepy town. Then she will wander, her heart all a laughter, Tracking the dream star that lights the purple gloom. She follows the proud and golden races after, As high as theirs her spirit, as high will be her doom. TWILIGHT BY THE CABIN Dusk, a pearl-grey river, o'er Hill and vale puts out the dayâ What do you wonder at, asthore, What's away in yonder grey? Dark the eyes that linger longâ Dream-fed heart, awake, come in, Warm the hearth and gay the song: Love with tender words would win Fades the eve in dreamy fire, But the heart of night is lit: Ancient beauty, old desire, By the cabin doorway flit. This is Etain's land and line, And the homespun cannot hide Kinship with a race divine, Thrill of rapture, light of pride. There her golden kinsmen are: And her heart a moment knew Angus like the evening star Fleeting through the dusk and dew. Throw the woman's mask away: Wear the opal glimmering dress; Let the feathered starlight ray Over every gleaming tress. Child of Etain, wherefore leave Light and laughter, joyful years, For the earth's grey coloured eve Ever dropping down with tears? Was it for some love of old? Ah, reveal thyself. The bars On the gateway would not hold: He will follow to the stars. KINSHIP In summer time, with high imaginings Of proud Crusaders and of Paynim kings, The children crowned themselves with famous names, And fought there, building up their merry games, Their mimic war, from old majestic things. There was no bitter hate then in the fight, For ancient law ruled victory and flight, And, victory and defeat alike forgot, They slept together in the selfsame cot, With arms about each other through the night. Ah, did our greatest on the battle-field See such a love, all magical, revealed, Pausing in combat? did they recognise Kinships in Tirnanoge through flashing eyes, What lovely brotherhood the foe concealed? And did they know, when all fierce wars were done, To what high home or dun their feet would run? What outstretched love would meet them at the gate? And that the end of the long road of hate Was adoration when the goal was won? Could you and I but of each other say From what a lordly House we took our way, And to what Hostel of the Gods we wend, Oh would we not anticipate the end? Oh would we not have paradise to-day? THE JOY OF EARTH Oh, the sudden wings arising from the ploughed fields brown Showered aloft in spray of song the wild-bird twitter floats O'er the unseen fount awhile, and then comes dropping down Nigh the cool brown earth to hush enraptured notes. Far within a dome of trembling opal throbs the fire, Mistily its rain of diamond lances shed below Touches eyes and brows and faces lit with wild desire For the burning silence whither we would go. Heart, be young; once more it is the ancient joy of earth Breathes in thee and flings the wild wings sunward to the dome To the light where all the children of the fire had birth Though our hearts and footsteps wander far from home. THE IRON AGE How came this pigmy rabble spun, After the gods and kings of old, Upon a tapestry begun With threads of silver and of gold? In heaven began the heroic tale What meaner destinies prevail! They wove about the antique brow A circlet of the heavenly air. To whom is due such reverence now, The thought âWhat deity is thereâ? We choose the chieftains of our race From hucksters in the market place. When in their councils over all Men set the power that sells and buys, Be sure the price of life will fall, Death be more precious in our eyes. Have all the gods their cycles run? Has devil worship now begun? O whether devil planned or no, Life here is ambushed, this our fate, That road to anarchy doth go, This to the grim mechanic state. The gates of hell are open wide, But lead to other hells outside. How has the fire Promethean paled? Who is there now who wills or dares Follow the fearless chiefs who sailed, Celestial adventurers, Who charted in undreamt of skies The magic zones of paradise? Mankind that sought to be god-kind, To wield the sceptre, wear the crown, What made it wormlike in its mind? Who bade it lay the sceptre down? Was it through any speech of thee, Misunderstood of Galilee? The whip was cracked in Babylon That slaves unto the gods might raise The golden turrets nigh the sun. Yet beggars from the dust might gaze Upon the mighty builders' art And be of proud uplifted heart. We now are servile to the mean Who once were slaves unto the proud. No lordlier life on earth has been Although the heart be lowlier bowed. Is there an iron age to be With beauty but a memory? Send forth, who promised long ago, âI will not leave thee or forsake,â Someone to whom our hearts may flow With adoration, though we make The crucifixion be the sign, The meed of all the kingly line. The morning stars were heard to sing When man towered golden in the prime. One equal memory let us bring Before we face our night in time. Grant us one only evening star, The iron age's avatar. AGE AND YOUTH We have left our youth behind: Earth is in its baby years: Void of wisdom cries the wind, And the sunlight knows no tears. When shall twilight feel the awe, All the rapt thought of the sage, And the lips of wind give law Drawn from out their lore of age? When shall earth begin to burn With such love as thrills my breast? When shall we together turn To our long, long home for rest? Child and father, we grow old While you laugh and play with flowers; And life's tale for us is told Holding only empty hours. Giant child, on you await All the hopes and fears of men In thy fulness is our fateâ What till then, oh, what till then? THE PARTING OF WAYS The skies from black to pearly grey Had veered without a star or sun; Only a burning opal ray Fell on your brow when all was done. Aye, after victory, the crown; Yet through the fight no word of cheer; And what would win and what go down No word could help, no light make clear. A thousand ages onward led Their joys and sorrows to that hour; No wisdom weighed, no word was said, For only what we were had power. There was no tender leaning there Of brow to brow in loving mood; For we were rapt apart, and were In elemental solitude. We knew not in redeeming day Whether our spirits would be found Floating along the starry way, Or in the earthly vapours drowned. Brought by the sunrise-coloured flame To earth, uncertain yet, the while I looked at you, there slowly came, Noble and sisterly, your smile. We bade adieu to love the old; We heard another lover then, Whose forms are myriad and untold, Sigh to us from the hearts of men. HOPE IN FAILURE Though now thou hast failed and art fallen, despair not because of defeat, Though lost for a while be thy heaven and weary of earth be thy feet, For all will be beauty about thee hereafter through sorrowful years, And lovely the dews for thy chilling and ruby thy heart-drip of tears. The eyes that had gazed from afar on a beauty that blinded the eyes Shall call forth its image for ever, its shadow in alien skies. The heart that had striven to beat in the heart of the Mighty too soon Shall still of that beating remember some errant and faltering tune. For thou hast but fallen to gather the last of the secrets of power; The beauty that breathes in thy spirit shall shape of thy sorrow a flower, The pale bud of pity shall open the bloom of its tenderest rays, The heart of whose shining is bright with the light of the Ancient of Days. FAITH Here where the loves of others close The vision of my heart begins. The wisdom that within us grows Is absolution for our sins. We took forbidden fruit and ate Far in the garden of His mind. The ancient prophecies of hate We proved untrue, for He was kind. He does not love the bended knees, The soul made wormlike in His sight, Within whose heaven are hierarchies And solar kings and lords of light. Who come before Him with the pride The Children of the King should bear, They will not be by Him denied, His light will make their darkness fair. To be afar from Him is death Yet all things find their fount in Him: And nearing to the sunrise breath Shine jewelled like the seraphim. A MIDNIGHT MEDITATION How often have I said, âWe may not grieve for the immortal dead.â And now, poor blenchÃ¨d heart, Thy ruddy hues all tremulous depart. Why be with fate at strife Because one passes on from death to life, Who may no more delay Rapt from our strange and pitiful dream away By one with ancient claim Who robes her with the spirit like a flame. Not lost this high beliefâ Oh, passionate heart, what is thy cause for grief? Is this thy sorrow now, She in eternal beauty may not bow Thy troubles to efface As in old time a head with gentle grace All tenderly laid by thine Taught thee the nearness of the love divine. Her joys no more for thee Than the impartial laughter of the sea, Her beauty no more fair For thee alone, but starry, everywhere. Her pity dropped for you No more than heaven above with healing dew Favours one home of menâ Ah! grieve not; she becomes herself again, And passed beyond thy sight She roams along the thought-swept fields of light, Moving in dreams until She finds again the root of ancient will, The old heroic love That emptied once the heavenly courts above. The angels heard from earth A mournful cry which shattered all their mirth, Raised by a senseless rout Warring in chaos with discordant shout, And that the pain might cease They grew rebellious in the Master's peace; And falling downward then The angelic lights were crucified in men; Leaving so radiant spheres For earth's dim twilight ever wet with tears That through those shadows dim Might breathe the lovely music brought from Him. And now my grief I see Was but that ancient shadow part of me Not yet attuned to good, Still blind and senseless in its warring mood, I turn from it and climb To the heroic spirit of the prime, The light that well foreknew All the dark ways that it must journey through. Yet seeing still a gain, A distant glory o'er the hills of pain, Through all that chaos wild A breath as gentle as a little child, Through earth transformed, divine, The Christ-soul of the universe to shine. ENDURANCE He bent above: so still her breath What air she breathed he could not say, Whether in worlds of life or death: So softly ebbed away, away, The life that had been light to him, So fled her beauty leaving dim The emptying chambers of his heart Thrilled only by the pang and smart, The dull and throbbing agony That suffers still, yet knows not why. Love's immortality so blind Dreams that all things with it conjoined Must share with it immortal day: But not of thisâbut not of thisâ The touch, the eyes, the laugh, the kiss, Fall from it and it goes its way. So blind he wept above her clay, âI did not think that you could die. Only some veil would cover you Our loving eyes could still pierce through; And see through dusky shadows still Move as of old your wild sweet will, Impatient every heart to win And flash its heavenly radiance in.â Though all the worlds were sunk in rest The ruddy star within his breast Would croon its tale of ancient pain, Its sorrow that would never wane, Its memory of the days of yore Moulded in beauty evermore. Ah, immortality so blind, To dream all things with it conjoined Must follow it from star to star And share with it immortal years. The memory, yearning, grief, and tears, Fall from it and it goes afar. He walked at night along the sands, He saw the stars dance overhead, He had no memory of the dead, But lifted up exultant hands To hail the future like a boy, The myriad paths his feet might press. Unhaunted by old tenderness He felt an inner secret joyâ A spirit of unfettered will Through light and darkness moving still Within the All to find its own, To be immortal and alone. DESTINY Like winds or waters were her ways: The flowing tides, the airy streams, Are troubled not by any dreams; They know the circle of their days. Like winds or waters were her ways: They heed not immemorial cries; They move to their high destinies Beyond the little voice that prays. She passed into her secret goal, And left behind a soul that trod In darkness, knowing not of God, But craving for its sister soul. WHEN When mine hour is come Let no teardrop fall And no darkness hover Round me where I lie. Let the vastness call One who was its lover, Let me breathe the sky. Where the lordly light Walks along the world, And its silent tread Leaves the grasses bright, Leaves the flowers uncurled, Let me to the dead Breathe a gay goodnight. TRANSFORMATIONS What miracle was it that made this grey Rathgar Seem holy earth, a leaping-place from star to star? I know I strode along grey streets disconsolate, Seeing nowhere a glimmer of the Glittering Gate, My vision baffled amid many dreams, for still The airy walls rose up in fabulous hill on hill. The stars were fortresses upon the dizzy slope And one and all were unassailable by hope. And then I turned and looked beyond high Terenure Where the last jewel breath of twilight floated pure, As if god Angus there, with his enchanted lyre, Sat swaying his bright body and hair of misty fire, And smote the slumber-string within the heavenly house That eve might lay upon the earth her tender brows, Her moth-dim tresses, and lip's invisible bloom, And eye's light shadowed under eyelids of the gloom, Till all that dark divine pure being, breast to breast, Lay cool upon the sleepy isle from east to west. Then I took thought remembering many a famous tale Told of those heavenly adventurers the Gael, Ere to a far-brought alien worship they inclined, And that its sorceries had left them shorn and blind, Crownless and sceptreless, while yet their magic might Could bow the lordly pillars of the day and night, And topple in one golden wreckage stars and sun, And mix their precious fires till heaven and earth were one. Then god and hero mingled, and the veil was rent That hid the fairy turrets in the firmament, The lofty god-uplifted cities that flash on high Dense with the silver-radiant deities of sky, And the gay populace that under ocean bide Unknowing of the flowing of the ponderous tide, And worlds where Time is full, where all with one accord Turn the flushed beauty of their faces to the Lord, Where the last ecstasy lights up each hill and glade And love is not remembered between man and maid, For lips laugh there at beauty the heart imagineth, And feet dance there at the holy Bridal of Love and Death. And as, with heart upborne and speedier footsteps, I Strode on my way, that twilight-burnished sky Seemed to heave up as from a mystic fountain thrown. And world on world those magic voyagers had known Glowed in the vast with burning hill and glittering stream, And all their shining folk, till earth was as a dream, A memory fleeting moth-like in the light to be Scorched by the fiery Dreamer of Eternity. And the bright host swept by me like a blazing wind O'er the dark churches where the blind mislead the blind. TRAGEDY A man went forth one day at eve: The long day's toil for him was done: The eye that scanned the page could leave Its task until to-morrow's sun. Upon the threshold where he stood Flared on his tired eyes the sight, Where host on host the multitude Burned fiercely in the dusky night. The starry lights at playâat playâ The giant children of the blue, Heaped scorn upon his trembling clay And with their laughter pierced him through. They seemed to say in scorn of him âThe power we have was once in thee. King, is thy spirit grown so dim, That thou art slave and we are free?â As out of him the powerâthe powerâ The freeâthe fearless, whirled in play, He knew himself that bitter hour The close of all his royal day. And from the stars' exultant dance Within the fiery furnace glow, Exile of all the vast expanse, He turned him homeward sick and slow. THE EVERLASTING BATTLE When in my shadowy hours I pierce the hidden heart of hopes and fears, They change into immortal joys or end in immemorial tears. Moytura's battle still endures and in this human heart of mine The golden sun powers with the might of demon darkness intertwine. I think that every teardrop shed still flows from Balor's eye of doom, And gazing on his ageless grief my heart is filled with ageless gloom: I close my ever-weary eyes and in my bitter spirit brood And am at one in vast despair with all the demon multitude. But in the lightning flash of hope I feel the sungod's fiery sling Has smote the horror in the heart where clouds of demon glooms take wing, I shake my heavy fears aside and seize the flaming sword of will, I am of Dana's race divine and know I am immortal still. IN MEMORIAM Poor little child, my pretty boy, Why did the hunter mark thee out? Wert thou betrayed by thine own joy? Singled through childhood's merry shout? And who on such a gentle thing Let slip the Hound that none may bar, That shall o'ertake the swiftest wing And tear the heavens down star by star? And borne away unto the night, What comfort in the vasty hall? Can That which towers from depth to height Melt in Its mood majestical, And laugh with thee as child to child? Or shall the gay light in thine eyes Drop stricken there before the piled Immutable immensities? Or shall the Heavenly Wizard turn Thy frailty to might in Him, And make my laughing elf to burn Comrade of crested cherubim? The obscure vale emits no sound, No sight, the chase has hurried far: The Quarry and the phantom Hound, Where are they now? Beyond what star? MOMENTARY The sweetest song was ever sung May soothe you but a little while: The gayest music ever rung Shall yield you but a fleeting smile. The well I digged you soon shall pass: You may but rest with me an hour: Yet drink, I offer you the glass, A moment of sustaining power, And give to you, if it be gain, Whether in pleasure or annoy, To see one elemental pain, One light of everlasting joy. UNITY One thing in all things have I seen: One thought has haunted earth and air: Clangour and silence both have been Its palace chambers. Everywhere I saw the mystic vision flow And live in men and woods and streams, Until I could no longer know The dream of life from my own dreams. Sometimes it rose like fire in me Within the depths of my own mind, And spreading to infinity, It took the voices of the wind: It scrawled the human mysteryâ Dim heraldryâon light and air; Wavering along the starry sea I saw the flying vision there. Each fire that in God's temple lit Burns fierce before the inner shrine, Dimmed as my fire grew near to it And darkened at the light of mine. At last, at last, the meaning caughtâ The spirit wears its diadem; It shakes its wondrous plumes of thought And trails the stars along with them. CONTENT Who are exiles? As for me Where beneath the diamond dome Lies the light on hill or tree, There my palace is and home. Who are lonely lacking care? Here the winds are living, press Close on bosom, lips and hairâ Well I know their soft caress. Sad or fain no more to live? I have pressed the lips of pain; With the kisses lovers give, Ransomed ancient joys again. Captive? See what stars give light In the hidden heart of clay: At their radiance dark and bright Fades the dreamy king of day. Night and day no more eclipse Friendly eyes that on us shine, Speech from old familiar lips Playmates of a youth divine. Come away, O, come away; We will quench the heart's desire Past the gateways of the day In the rapture of the fire. RECONCILIATION I begin through the grass once again to be bound to the Lord; I can see, through a face that has faded, the face full of rest Of the earth, of the mother, my heart with her heart in accord, As I lie 'mid the cool green tresses that mantle her breast I begin with the grass once again to be bound to the Lord. By the hand of a child I am led to the throne of the King For a touch that now fevers me not is forgotten and far, And His infinite sceptred hands that sway us can bring Me in dreams from the laugh of a child to the song of a star. On the laugh of a child I am borne to the joy of the King. VOICES OF THE STONES TO PADRAIC COLUM I made these verses in a rocky land, And I have named them Voices of the Stones, Although they do not keep that innocence Was shed on me when quiet made me kin To the cold immobile herd. All things have changed From primal nature save these stones: all things Since Eden, bird and beast and fin, have strayed Far from that shining garden of His thought: We also. Only the humble stones have kept Their morning starriness of purity Immutable. Being unfallen they breathe Only unfallen life; and with my cheek Pressed to their roughness I had part regained My morning starriness, and made these songs Half from the hidden world and half from this. OUTCAST Sometimes when alone At the dark close of day, Men meet an outlawed majesty And hurry away. They come to the lighted house; They talk to their dear; They crucify the mystery With words of good cheer. When love and life are over, And flight's at an end, On the outcast majesty They lean as a friend. EXILES The gods have taken alien shapes upon them, Wild peasants driving swine In a strange country. Through the swarthy faces The starry faces shine. Under grey tattered skies they strain and reel there: Yet cannot all disguise The majesty of fallen gods, the beauty, The fire beneath their eyes. They huddle at night within low, clay-built cabins; And, to themselves unknown, They carry with them diadem and sceptre And move from throne to throne. ARTISTRY To bring this loveliness to be, Even for an hour, the Builder must Have wrought in the laboratory Of many a star for its sweet dust. Oh, to make possible that heart And that gay breath so lightly sighed: What agony was in the art! How many gods were crucified! MUTINY That blazing galleon the sun, This dusky coracle I ride, Both under secret orders sail, And swim upon the selfsame tide. The fleet of stars, my boat of soul, By perilous magic mountains pass, Or lie where no horizons gleam Fainting upon a sea of glass. Come, break the seals and tell us now Upon what enterprise we roam: To storm what city of the gods, Orâsail for the green fields of home! JEALOUSY Youth met within a garden, And youth to youth revealed Time's loveliest hidden secrets, Things that were dead and sealed: What domes of ivory wonder Rose in the golden race: What heavens were fabled o'er themâ For some face like this face. Youth roamed by shore and mountain And its new wisdom told: But earth and sea were silent, Their lovely faces cold. A HOLY HILL Be still: be still: nor dare Unpack what you have brought, Nor loosen on this air Red gnomes of your thought. Uncover: bend the head And let the feet be bare; This air that thou breathest Is holy air. Sin not against the Breath, Using ethereal fire To make seem as faery A wanton desire. Know that this granite height May be a judgement throne, Dread thou the unmoveable will, The wrath of stone. TIME At every heart-beat Through the magic day A lovely laughing creature Ran away. Where have they wandered, The flock so gay? I had but looked on them And away they ran, The exquisite lips untouched. As they began To part, Time swept them On his caravan. These new-born beauties The tyrant took. Their gaze was on mine And mine forsook. I could not stay even One lovely look. In what fold are they? Could I pursue Through the Everliving And know anew All those golden motions That were you? Were beauty only A day the same, We could know the Maker And name His name. We would know the substance Was holy flame. Is there an oasis Where Time stands still, Where the fugitive beauty Stays as we will? Is there an oasis Where Time stands still? SURVIVAL What pent-up fury in those arms, Red gilded by the sun's last breath! The spade along the ridges runs As if it had a race with death. The clods fly right: the clods fly left: The ridges rise on either side, The tireless fury is not spent, Though the fierce sunset long has died. The strength which tossed the hills on high, And rent the stormy seas apart, Is still within those mighty limbs, Still stirs the dreams of that wild heart. RESURRECTION Not by me these feet were led To the path beside the wave, Where the naiad lilies shed Moonfire o'er a lonely grave. Let the dragons of the past In their caverns sleeping lie. I am dream-betrayed, and cast Into that old agony. And an anguish of desire Burns as in the sunken years, And the soul sheds drops of fire All unquenchable by tears. I, who sought on high for calm, In the Everliving find All I was in what I am, Fierce with gentle intertwined; Hearts which I had crucified With my heart that tortured them; Penitence, unfallen prideâ These my thorny diadem! Thou would'st ease in heaven thy pain, Oh, thou fiery, bleeding thing! All thy wounds will wake again At the heaving of a wing. All thy dead with thee shall rise, Dies Irae. If the soul To the Everliving flies, There shall meet it at the goal Love that Time had overlaid, Deaths that we again must dieâ Let the dragons we have made In their caverns sleeping lie. FORLORN My wisdom crumbles. I am as a lone child. Oh, had I the heart now My weeping were wild. My palace dwindles Thin into air: The Ancient Darkness Is everywhere: But the heart is gone That could understand, And the child is dead That had taken Its hand. RESCUE How deep the night about that soul! How fast the manacles! I brood And recreate in my own heart Its agony of solitude. Have golden lips breathed in that dark? And was the breath as vainly blown As yon frail wind that trembles on This mammoth herd of brutish stone? A kinsman of the cherubim Chained in this pit's abysmal mire! Sound for the rescue! Bugles, blow! Gird on the armoury of fire! TRANSIENCE Why does my fancy soon forsake All that is perfect to the eye, The ruffled silver of the lake, The silent silver of the sky, Its single star that is so shy, That trembles like a golden fawn Strayed from the blue and shadowy wood Of night upon the twilight lawn: Why is the heart so soon withdrawn? Even on earth's last lovely brood Of primroses it hardly dwells, Though myriads, a tender mist, Warm the pale green of chilly dells, The aftershine of amethyst, The glades of midnight overhead, Where browse the flocks the fawn has led, All glimmering, till they are laid Folden in light which is their shadeâ Did ever earth from its first prime Move to a lovelier dance than this? But yet I cannot keep in chime. Swift as the whirling dervish is My heart floats on a swifter tide. As one upon a hurrying stream Sees towers and forests as in dream Drift by him upon either side, So do I see, and then I fly From these to that they prophesy. It is not that my heart is cold To beauty, for my pulses beat As bloom and odour jet their sweet From tiny fountains in the mould, And many rainbow trumpets blow; But still my heart divines from these How near are the Hesperides, How rich to have this overflow From sacred earth through common clay: And all my being yearns to run, To tread the meadows of the sun And bask in that enchanted day. The suns that rise, the suns that set, Time's tidal waves of blue and gold That roll from far ethereal seas, Hill-land and forest, starlit pool, Are images we soon forget, And swiftest when most beautiful. For when most beautiful we feel That there is something they reveal, Some lordlier being of their kind; And beauty only meaneth this And to the symbol we are blind. The gifts that fortune brings, the kiss, The lovely life, the heart unveiled, Are images of heights unscaled. And we adore while to our thought Being with symbol seems enwrought, Yet if we would the rapture stay, The spirit is the open door Through which the prisoner steals away. Maybe there is a native shore For us, for it, where we may find A beauty stedfast to the mind, Joy that will not so lightly stray To join the maskers in the dance, Eternity with Time at play. A MOUNTAIN WIND The cold limbs of the air Brush by me on the hill, Climb to the utmost crag, Leap out, then all is still. Ah, but what high intent In the cold will of wind; What sceptre would it grasp To leave these dreams behind! Trail of celestial things: White centaurs, winged in flight, Through the fired heart sweep on, A hurricane of light. I have no plumes for air: Earth hugs to it my bones. Leave me, O sky-born powers, Brother to grass and stones. PROMISE Be not so desolate Because thy dreams have flown And the hall of the heart is empty And silent as stone, As age left by children Sad and alone. Those delicate children, Thy dreams, still endure: All pure and lovely things Wend to the Pure. Sigh not: unto the fold Their way was sure. Thy gentlest dreams, thy frailest, Even those that were Born and lost in a heart-beat, Shall meet thee there. They are become immortal In shining air. The unattainable beauty The thought of which was pain, That flickered in eyes and on lips And vanished again: That fugitive beauty Thou shalt attain. The lights innumerable That led thee on and on, The Masque of Time ended, Shall glow into one. It shall be with thee for ever Thy travel done. ABUNDANCE Like grey mastodon Upon the mountain side Rocks lay as if to guard Its austere pride. All stone unto the eye: Yet is the heart at rest As babe happed in cradle Or on the breast. All that earth is, Mountain or solitude, Was born out of pity And is milk for her brood. ANCIENT The sky is cold as pearl Over a milk-white land. The snow seems older than Time, Though it fell through a dreaming, and Will vanish itself as a dream At the dimmest touch of a hand. Out of a timeless world Shadows fall upon Time, From a beauty older than earth A ladder the soul may climb. I climb by the phantom stair To a whiteness older than Time. NATURAL MAGIC From whence has flown this argosy of air That o'er the forest dropped its merchandise, Spilling a fire so rich, a wine so rare? Through the long glade from russet floor to skies Darkness and fire are revellers everywhere. The leaves like gold and emerald butterflies With myriad quiverings roof the forest glade. Around me where I lie The orange flames race through the tattered shade Dazzling the downcast eye. Downcast the eye; but not the heart within; The aerial wine delights: the unblinding fire Opens the ways, far past the leafy din And revelry of light; by what desire Borne onward through invisible gates to win To that high region where unto one lyre, Played by the Magian of the Beautiful, The starry feet keep time, And these last hyacinths in shadows cool Echo with distant rhyme. Distant! The wizard air has breathed away The heaviness from earth. The sombre trees To cloud change unimaginably; nay; To fire, to mind. Ancestral images, Ere that unfallen Eden had its day Of yet undimmed forest and flower, these Living and lustrous and ethereal shapes I see with sight unblind, In heavenly valleys or on glittering capes Glowed in the Magian's mind. They fade: the forest flickers round me now: Once more the incessant birth and death of light On russet floor, green leaf and burnished bough Dazzle. Yet still the visionary sight Holds faintly, as these thicker airs allow, A magic mist of dancers pale and bright, A foam of golden faces from the spheres Beyond sun rise or set, With eyes that had for long forgotten tears Or never had been wet. Vanished the angelic trees and beings all! The wood darkens: the wind has ceased to fan The glade to flame. Oh, it was magical! Can I recall? The blinding sunlight ran Over the burning hyacinth to fall Starry upon yon water. So began The incantation of the light which brought Rapt face and fiery wing, The Heaven of Heavens: a myriad marvel wrought And from so slight a thing! OLD WINE The boys with their golden limbs Shine out through the tawny glare. They race, and after their heels The shadows in purple flare. They dance from the sand to the sea And shatter its blue as they pass, Till the tide is frothy with light And glimmers with bubbles like glass. And Michael, Rory and Teige Are aglow with the Sun and the Wind; For unto their rapturous youth The ancient nurses are kind. They drink the oldest of wine. It sparkles like fire in their clay, A Spirit breathed in the waters Ere Time had buried a day. ADVENTURE The night is still as stone. What wonder at its core Lures the hot soul, a lone Conquistador? Is there a Fount of Youth, An Eldorado there? What may it find, what truth In hollow air? Yet from this waste it can Bring back its golden hordes Captive, its caravan Of starry words. NIGHT WIND I love to think this fragrant air I breathe in the deep-bosomed night Has mixed with beauty, and may bear The burden of a heart's delight. This may have been the burning breath That uttered Deirdre's love. It may Have been a note outlasting death As Sappho sang her heart away. It may have fanned a joy so deep That Ilium must pay the price, And under desert sand must sleep Heroes and towers in sacrifice. And this rich air, it may have been,â To bring these dreams, so sweet a throng,â Sighed by the lovely listening queen While Solomon had sung his song. So it will take from me, from thee, Ere from our being it departs, And keep for lovers yet to be All the enchantment of our hearts. MAGNET I had sweet company Because I sought out none, But took who came to me, All by the magnet drawn. I had sweet company. I had no dark friends but one. They passed on and away, The old lure had gone. The partings all were gay. By some new magic drawn They went another way. I had no heartache but one. Because that in my heart There lurked satyr or faun, There was one could not depart And one who must be gone. While the faun crouched in the heart There was one who must be gone. EARTH Though I leap lightly O'er the unmoving clay, It is earth is ethereal, Not I who run away. Earth is a giant, Yet on her sapphire round She pads so softly You do not hear a sound. Fire, typhoon, her children, Who fill you with awe, Are gentle as she is, Obeying sweet law. MIRAGE Those lovely lunar faces By hearths to which we strayed, The spells around them woven Within the gilded shade, After an ancient resting place The images were made. Would we have stayed our questing, Declined unto this lot, Had love and home no story Of the high things we sought, Of that great House we parted from And had not all forgot: The peace as deep as being Passed beyond sight or sound, Where lover and beloved Are in each other drowned, Fulness unto the uttermost, A deep that has no bound. From memories and hauntings, Through breathings of sweet air On brow, in eyes and tresses, Was set the tender snare, All phantom of the deep content The heart imagined there. Brief balm for all our anguish At that full life denied, Even from the noblest beauty Soon, soon, the wonder died. Who won Helen and Deirdre's love, Within their hearts they sighed. UNMEET No, it was not our own, That high delight; It came with grass and flowers, As day and night, A breath from heavenly powers That still delight. The innocents of earth, Her grass, her flowers, May mingle in the play Of heavenly powers, Who burned our life away In what brief hours. HEAVENWORLD Why do I see in this still light The Psyche of the City rise? Is mine own psyche plumed for air And shall that follow to the skies? A Phantom trembles in the hills, In woodland and in waters blue, Whose breath is lovely in my ear, âCome, we will fly afar with you âAnd find some island on the air Where we may stay our delicate fire, And the Gold-gleaming Genius weave From us thy Land of Heart's Desire.â IF If not a plume may vanish out of air, If all things living stand, But by a will, and that withheld, we were Less than a shifting sandâ Where in our being has the god its hold? Where is the burning hand? Where does the might that holds our frailty Lie hidden? Oh, somewhere A light shows where the hand is laid, will lead Us by some lustrous stair To find the god, take the invisible hand And tread the starry air! MAGNIFICENCE Cloistered amid these austere rocks, A brooding seer, I watched an hour, Close to the earth, lost to all else, The marvel of a tiny flower. To build its palace walls of jade What myriads toiled in dark and cold: And what gay traders from the sun Brought down its sapphire and its gold! Oh, palace of the universe! Oh, changing halls of day and night! Does the high Builder dream in thee With more of wonder and delight? SNARES I faint rememb'ring all that shook my will; How the light outposts even of paradise O'ercame me with the witchery of eyes Or delicate magic of the lips: how still A motion white and fugitive can thrill With longings that are immortalities. How, if the heart to these frail enemies Yields, can it hope to scale the heavenly hill, See beauty in its fulness, or endure The last temptation, which is but seeing The gorgeous shadow of all that is its own? That mirrored majesty is the last lure To hide from it its own immortal being. Heaven lies between the spirit and its throne. THE LOST OTHERS You set your heart on Nancy. You won your fancy, lad. But love had never taught you What other names she had, Or what gay Naiad lent her grace, What shining Oread. You did not know what beauty Thronged in one light disguise: What eyes gazed out of Faery, What Sibyl from the Wise, What burning miracle her soul Was in its native skies. You won your pretty Nancy; But she was all you had. The starry women vanished. A lonely lass and lad Mutely upon each other gaze Nor know why they are sad. THE SOWER After the sower with the seed What mightier being strides behind, Who from a fiery hand strews out The elves of life upon the wind? And every one becomes a slave Labouring through earth from seed to sun, Till the green pillar's thick with grain And the long marvellous labour's done. Ah, when the food is made for man, The spirits that the scythe sets free: Do they exult and do they fly, Sower of Life, again to Thee? CARRIERS Those features that enchant you, Light limbs that shine like air: Be of one spell the master; The coloured wisp may bear Unto the Magic-Maker. Yea, a wisp of dream will bear. Too rich a freight may founder. Imperial dreams go down. For light must be the galleon That shall not sink and drown. Thin is the airy ocean. Yea, a crumb of earth may drown. They tell in sacred story One caught a wisp of dream, And saw in holy aether A shining woman gleam, The Usha, the Dawn Maiden; Yea, the beauty beyond dream. MOMENTARY What Wizard at twilight Made gay the light feet? What Voice in their voices Sounded so sweet? Who whirled the children Into His dream, To sway with the boughs And curve with the stream? One dance in one mind Were clouds in the air, The rapturous feet, The flicker of hair. Too soon it was over The magical hour. They parted like leaves From a withering flower. The twilight thickened: The moon rose pale, And they ran to their homes By the hill or the vale. FOR REMEMBRANCE We heard the accent of the King of Kings, And in our memory of immortal things We stored the prophets words. Oh, it was wise. Be you remembered, gay and lovely eyes! Twin avatars of all that life desires, The pure, the unimaginable fires, Within the Mother's being. Oh, twin stars, Be you remembered as those avatars, The Wise revealers; for through you we see Life's radiance and its ceaseless ecstasy. A MURMUR IN THE GRASS O pale-lipped blossom Why do you sigh? âFor the many million Times I must die Ere I be as that glory Up in the sky.â Your sisters with beauty Are satisfied. Is it not envy Dreams of such pride? âNo, there is nothing To life denied. âIt would be unjust, Unjust, if we Could dream of a beauty We might not be. Life is becoming All we see. âI shall rise from the grass, I shall fill all the blue, And I shall be blossom And fire and dew In the boundlessness We travel through.â THE LONELY Lone and forgotten Through a long sleeping, In the heart of age A child woke weeping. No invisible mother Was nigh him there Laughing and nodding From earth and air. No elfin comrades Came at his call, And the earth and the air Were blank as a wall. The darkness thickened Upon him creeping, In the heart of age A child lay weeping. THE ETERNAL LOVERS Whirled on their starry Odyssey From heaven to earth, in this deep glade The eternal lovers hold their court Within the heart of man and maid. That darkness throbs with hidden fire: The pulse beats fast: the heavens call: Earth is transfigured, and the twain Breathe as they did before the Fall. When King and Queen feast in the heart They squander all the gold of years To make their banquet gay, then leave A ruined heart, a house of tears. A DREAM OF DEFEATED BEAUTY All day they played in gardens hid amid golden towers That made the blue burn deeper above their world of flowers. Within their dream-girt gardens the pools drank in the sky And the light laughing figures that flamed or fluttered by. There lute or harp string sounded from noon to eventide, And every voice that murmured a mirror was to pride. All day on light and music the young queen feasted deep: Her happy heart foretelling the hour of love and sleep, When he unto whose glory the earth made sacrifice Would give all to make richer the dark of lovely eyes. Within her palace chamber the purple slumbrous shade At midnight slowly lightened where the young queen was laid; And moonlight marbled over flower foam and jewel sheen And carved in pearl and mystery the white limbs of the queen. The young queen smiled in slumber as if in dream she knew What dragons chained lay sleeping: what horns for battle blew: And who would bow the genii from thrones of blinding fire To send their airy children to dance at her desire. The young queen paled in slumber as if she there had known A majesty unbending on some unconquered throne. Where had she soared in slumber? And who was this who came Making the dusk all starry with plumes of magic flame? Who mourned in lofty sorrow above the body's pride âThis Babylon that I have builtâ and bowed its head and sighed. MERCHANDISE OF LIGHT Was it not worth the farewell to the sun, O caravan of rays through desert space, To bear the image of this lovely face? Now hurry with the beauty you have won. Where shall it not be known when you have run The shining leagues to your appointed place, And far and starry hamlets know that grace, So from the light new beauty may be spun? Marvel of animate ivory and fire! Proud head upcast with heaven-assailing gaze As if for flight! Nay, nay, you need not wings To reach the sky; for, elder to desire, Your image scatters on a million rays And, quivering with that beauty, aether sings. HEREAFTER Although the merchant be your care The mart or field, do not forgetâ To leave a glory on the air When the red Gaelic sun has setâ Some prophet must have cried a word The hurrying world will pause to hear. Even for the unfaltering sword No one will hold your memory dear. The Greece of Pericles is cold: Yet still there shines beyond its seas The wisdom Diotima told In the rapt ear of Socrates. WASTE All that heroic mood, The will to suffer pain, Were it on beauty spent, An intellectual gain: Had a fierce pity breathed O'er wronged or fallen life, Though strife had been unwise We were not shamed by strife: Had they but died for some High image in the mind, Not spilt the sacrifice For words hollow as wind! Darkened the precious fire: The will we honour most Spent in the waste! What sin Against the Holy Ghost! WATCHERS My heart grew ice because of that grim head, Red sparking eyes alert for pounce or flight, Features miscarven by strange appetite, Till kinship with the Elohim was dead, And kestrel, snake and rat were in their stead, Glaring through eyeholes that let in no light, Slinking through corridors made black as night, The paths the heavenly hierarchies should tread. A company of starry ones without That midnight wait on the lost wanderer, The hero whom these demon things immure. The shining ones make answer to my doubt, âOur Lord is buried in this sepulchre. We wait His resurrection. It is sure!â A PRISONER Brixton, September 1920 See, though the oil be low, more purely still and higher The flame burns in the body's lamp. The watchers still Gaze with unseeing eyes while the Promethean will, The Uncreated Light, the Everlasting Fire, Sustain themselves against the torturer's desire, Even as the fabled Titan chained upon the hill. Burn on, shine here, thou immortality, until We too can light our lamps at the funereal pyre; Till we too can be noble, unshakeable, undismayed; Till we too can burn with the holy flame, and know There is that within us can conquer the dragon pain, And go to death alone, slowly and unafraid. The candles of God already are burning row on row: Farewell, light-bringer; fly to thy fountain again. A LOST DREAM The unleashed air, A wild cold animal, Hunts on the hills. Yet the hollow amid the rocks Is brimful of quiet, So quiet Faery may be heard: So still There is not a flicker In the candle of dream. The warm East Is at my feet. In burning blue Lagoon beyond lagoon Faints shimmering, All lotus besprinkledâ Rose lotuses! A woman leans, A dream out of Allah. The water quivers In ivory ringlets Beneath her fingers As she plucks the blossom she twines In the dark shining of her hair. She stands; Stillness in ivory! But ere I see her eyes, Ere I make them mine, The wild cold animal Leaps into the hollow. The candle flickers and is blown; The paths all are darkened. A dream has lost its way to life. MICHAEL A wind blew by from icy hills, Shook with cold breath the daffodils, And shivered as with silver mist The lake's pale leaden amethyst. It pinched the barely budded trees And rent the twilight tapestries: Left for one hallowed instant bare A single star in lonely air O'er rocky fields the bitter wind Had swept of all their human kind. Ere that the fisher folk were all Snug under thatch and sheltering wall, Breathing the cabin's air of gold, Safe from blue storm and nipping cold. And, clustered round the hearth within With fiery hands and burnished chin, They sat and listened to old tales Or legends of gigantic gales. Some told of phantom craft they knew That sailed with a flame-coloured crew, And came up strangely through the wind Havens invisible to find By those rare cities poets sung Cresting the Islands of the Young. How do the heights above our head, The depths below the water spread, Waken the spirit in such wise That to the deep the deep replies, And in far spaces of the soul The oceans stir, the heavens roll? Michael must leave the morrow morn The countryside where he was born, And all day long had Michael clung Unto the kin he lived among. But at some talk of sea and sky He heard an older mother cry. The cabin's golden air grew dim: The cabin's walls drew down on him: The cabin's rafters hid from sight The cloudy roof-tree of the night. And Michael could not leave behind His kinsmen of the wave and wind Without farewell. The path he took Ran like a twisted, shining brook, Speckled with stones and ruts and rills, Mid a low valley of dark hills, And trees so tempest bowed that they Seemed to seek double root in clay. At last the dropping valley turned: A sky of murky citron burned, Above through flying purples seen Lay pools of heavenly blue and green. From the sea rim unto the caves Rolled on a mammoth herd of waves. And all about the rocky bay Leaped up grey forests of wild spray, Glooming above the ledges brown Ere their pale drift came drenching down. Things delicate and dewy clung To Michael's cheeks. The salt air stung. From crag to crag did Michael leap Until he overhung the deep; Saw in vast caves the waters roam, The ceaseless ecstasy of foam, Whirlpools of opal, lace of light Strewn over quivering malachite, Ice-tinted mounds of water rise, Glinting as with a million eyes, Reel in and out of light and shade, Show depths of ivory or jade, New broidery every instant wear Spun by the magic weaver, Air. Then Michael's gaze was turned from these Unto the far, rejoicing seas Whose twilight legions onward rolled A turbulence of dusky gold, A dim magnificence of froth, A thunder tone which was not wrath, But such a speech as earth might cry Unto far kinsmen in the sky. The spray was tossed aloft in air: A bird was flying here and there. Foam, bird and twilight to the boy Seemed to be but a single joy. He closed his eyes that he might be Alone with all that ecstasy. What was it unto Michael gave This joy, the life of earth and wave? Or did his candle shine so bright But by its own and natural light? Ah, who can answer for what powers Are with us in the secret hours! Though wind and wave cried out no less, Entranced unto forgetfulness, He heard no more the water's din; A golden ocean rocked within, A boat of bronze and crystal wrought And steered by the enchanter, Thought, Was flying with him fast and far To isles that glimmered, each a star Hung low upon the distant rim, And then the vision rushed on him. The palaces of light were there With towers that faded up in air, With amethyst and silver spires, And casements lit with precious fires, And mythic forms with wings outspread And faces from which light was shed High upon gleaming pillars set On turret and on parapet. The bells were chiming all around And the sweet air was drunk with sound. Too swift did Michael pass to see Ildathach's mystic chivalry Graved on the walls, its queens and kings Girt round with eyes and stars and wings. The magic boat with Michael drew To some deep being that he knew, Some mystery that to the wise Is clouded o'er by Paradise, Some will that would not let him stay Hurried the boat away, away. At last its fiery wings were still Folded beneath some heavenly hill. But was that Michael light as air Was travelling up the mighty stair? Or had impetuous desire Woven for him that form of fire Which with no less a light did shine Than those with countenance divine Who thronged the gateway as he came, Faces of rapture and of flame, The glowing, deep, unwavering eyes Of those eternity makes wise. And lofty things to him were said As to one risen from the dead. What there beyond the gate befell Michael could never after tell. Imagination still would fail Some height too infinite to scale, Some being too profound to scan, Some time too limitless to span. Yet when he lifted up his eyes That foam was grey against the skies. That same wild bird was on the wing. That twilight wave was glimmering. And twilight wave and foam and bird Had hardly in his vision stirred Since he had closed his eyes to be Of that majestic company. And can a second then suffice To hurry us to Paradise, What seemed so endlessly sublime Shrink to a particle of time? Why was the call on Michael made? What charge was on his spirit laid? And could the way for him be sure Made by excess of light obscure? However fiery is the dream, How faint in life the echoing gleam! And faint was all that happed that day As home he went his dreamy way. And now has Michael, for his share Of life, the city's dingy air, By the black reek of chimneys smudged O'er the dark warehouse where he drudged, Where for dull life men pay in toll Toil and the shining of the soul. Within his attic he would fret Like a wild creature in a net, And on the darkness he would make The jewel of a little lake, A bloom of fairy blue amid The bronze and purple heather hid; Make battlemented cliffs grow red Where the last rose of day was shed, Be later in rich darkness seen Against a sky of glowing green. Or he would climb where quiet fills With dream the shepherd on the hills, Where he could see as from high land The golden sickle of the sand Curving around the bay to where The granite cliffs were worn by air, And watch the wind and waves at play, The heavenly gleam of falling spray. The sunlit surges foam below In wrinklings as of liquid snow. And he could breathe the airs that blew From worlds invisible he knew. How far away now from the boy! How unassailable their joy! So Michael would recall each place As lovers a remembered face. But, though the tender may not tire, Memory is but a fading fire. And Michael's might have sunken low, Changed to grey ash its coloured glow, Did not upon his hearing fall The mountain speech of Donegal, And that he swiftly turned to greet The tongue whose accent was so sweet, And found one of that eager kind The army of the Gaelic mind, Still holding through the Iron Age The spiritual heritage, The story from the gods that ran Through many a cycle down to man. And soon with them had Michael read The legend of the famous dead, From him who with his single sword Stayed a great army at the ford, Down to the vagrant poets, those Who gave their hearts to the Dark Rose, And of the wanderers who set sail And found a lordlier Innisfail, And saw a sun that never set And all their hearts' desires were met. How may the past if it be dead Its light within the living shed? Or does the Everliving hold Earth's memories from the Age of Gold? And are our dreams, ardours and fires But ancient unfulfilled desires? And do they shine within our clay And do they urge us on their way? As Michael read the Gaelic scroll It seemed the story of the soul, And those who wrought, lest there should fail, From earth the legend of the Gael, Seemed warriors of Eternal Mind, Still holding in a world grown blind, From which belief and hope had gone, The lovely magic of its dawn. Thrice on the wheel of time recurred The season of the risen Lord Since Michael left his home behind And faced the chilly Easter wind, And saw the twilight waters gleam And dreamed an unremembered dream. Was it because the Easter time With mystic nature was in chime That memory was roused from sleep, Or was deep calling unto deep? The lord in man had risen here, From the dark sepulchre of fear, Was laughing, gay and undismayed, Though on a fragile barricade The bullet rang, the death star broke, The street waved dizzily in smoke, And there the fierce and lovely breath Of flame in the grey mist was death. Yet Michael felt within him rise The rapture that is sacrifice. What miracle was wrought on him So that each leaden freighted limb Seemed lit with fire, seemed light as air? How came upon him dying there Amid the city's burning piles The vision of the mystic isles? For underneath and through the smoke A glint of golden waters broke; And floating on that phantom tide With fiery wings expanded wide A barque of bronze and crystal wrought Called forth by the enchanter, Thought. And noble faces glowed above, Faces of ecstasy and love, And eyes whose shining calm and pure Was in eternity secure, And lofty forms of burnished air Stood on the deck by Michael there. And spirit upon spirit gazed, And one to Michael's lips upraised A cup filled from that holy well O'er which the Nuts of Wisdom fell, And as he drank there reeled away Vision of earth and night and day, And he was far away from these Afloat upon the heavenly seas. I do not know if such a band Came from the Many Coloured Land Or whether in our being we Make such a magic phantasy Of images which draw us hence Unto our own magnificence. Yet many a one a tryst has kept With the immortal while he slept, Woke unremembering, went his way, Life seemed the same from day to day, Till the predestined hour came, A hidden will leaped up in flame, And through its deed the risen soul Strides on self-conquering to the goal. This was the dream of one who died For country, said his countryside. We choose this cause or that, but still The Everlasting works Its will. The slayer and the slain may be Knit in a secret harmony. What does the spirit urge us to? Some sacrifice that may undo The bonds that hold us to the clay And limit life to this cold day? Some for a gentle dream will die: Some for an empire's majesty: Some for a loftier humankind, Some to be free as cloud or wind, Will leave their valley, climb their slope. Whate'er the deed, whate'er the hope, Through all the varied battle-cries A Shepherd with a single voice Still lures us nigh the Gates of Gold That open to the Starry Fold. So it may be that Michael died For some far other countryside Than that grey Ireland he had known, Yet on his dream of it was thrown Some light from that consuming Fire Which is the end of all desire. If men adore It as the power Empires and cities tower on tower Are built in worship by the way High Babylon or Nineveh. Seek It as love and there may be A Golden Age and Arcady. All shadows are they of one thing To which all life is journeying. EPILOGUE Well, when all is said and done Best within my narrow way, May some angel of the sun Muse memorial o'er my clay: âHere was beauty all betrayed From the freedom of her state; From her human uses stayed On an idle rhyme to wait. âAh, what deep despair might move If the beauty lit a smile, Or the heart was warm with love That was pondering the while. âHe has built his monument With the winds of time at strife, Who could have before he went Written on the book of life. âTo the stars from which he came Empty handed, he goes home; He who might have wrought in flame Only traced upon the foam.â</field>
