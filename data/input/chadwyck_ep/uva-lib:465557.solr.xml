      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO ROBERT SOUTHEY, WHO HAS EXHIBITED IN HIS PROSE WORKS, AS IN HIS LIFE, THE PURITY AND VIRTUES OF ADDISON AND LOCKE, AND IN HIS POETRY THE IMAGINATION AND SOUL OF SPENSER, THESE POEMS, WITH EVERY AFFECTIONATE PRAYER, ARE INSCRIBED BY HIS SINCERE FRIEND, WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES. SONNETS, ETC. AT TYNEMOUTH PRIORY, AFTER A TEMPESTUOUS VOYAGE. As slow I climb the cliff's ascending side, Much musing on the track of terror past, When o'er the dark wave rode the howling blast, Pleased I look back, and view the tranquil tide That laves the pebbled shore: and now the beam Of evening smiles on the gray battlement, And yon forsaken tower that time has rent:— The lifted oar far off with transient gleam Is touched, and hushed is all the billowy deep! Soothed by the scene, thus on tired Nature's breast A stillness slowly steals, and kindred rest; While sea-sounds lull her, as she sinks to sleep, Like melodies that mourn upon the lyre, Waked by the breeze, and, as they mourn, expire! BAMBOROUGH CASTLE. Ye holy Towers that shade the wave-worn steep, Long may ye rear your aged brows sublime, Though, hurrying silent by, relentless Time Assail you, and the winds of winter sweep Round your dark battlements; for far from halls Of Pride, here Charity hath fixed her seat, Oft listening, tearful, when the tempests beat With hollow bodings round your ancient walls; And Pity, at the dark and stormy hour Of midnight, when the moon is hid on high, Keeps her lone watch upon the topmost tower, And turns her ear to each expiring cry; Blessed if her aid some fainting wretch may save, And snatch him cold and speechless from the wave. THE RIVER WAINSBECK. While slowly wanders thy sequestered stream, Wainsbeck, the mossy-scattered rocks among, In fancy's ear making a plaintive song To the dark woods above, that waving seem To bend o'er some enchanted spot, removed From life's vain coil; I listen to the wind, And think I hear meek Sorrow's plaint, reclined O'er the forsaken tomb of him she loved!— Fair scenes, ye lend a pleasure, long unknown, To him who passes weary on his way;— Yet recreated here he may delay A while to thank you; and when years have flown, And haunts that charmed his youth he would renew, In the world's crowd he will remember you. THE TWEED VISITED. O Tweed! a stranger, that with wandering feet O'er hill and dale has journeyed many a mile, (If so his weary thoughts he might beguile), Delighted turns thy stranger-stream to greet. The waving branches that romantic bend O'er thy tall banks a soothing charm bestow; The murmurs of thy wandering wave below Seem like the converse of some long-lost friend. Delightful stream! though now along thy shore, When spring returns in all her wonted pride, The distant pastoral pipe is heard no more; Yet here while laverocks sing could I abide, Far from the stormy world's contentious roar, To muse upon thy banks at eventide. ON LEAVING A VILLAGE IN SCOTLAND. Clysdale! as thy romantic vales I leave, And bid farewell to each retiring hill, Where musing memory seems to linger still, Tracing the broad bright landscape; much I grieve That, mingled with the toiling crowd, no more I may return your varied views to mark, Of rocks amid the sunshine towering dark, Of rivers winding wild, or mountains hoar, Or castle gleaming on the distant steep!— Yet many a look back on thy hills I cast, And many a softened image of the past Sadly combine, and bid remembrance keep, To soothe me with fair scenes, and fancies rude, When I pursue my path in solitude. EVENING. Evening! as slow thy placid shades descend, Veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still, The lonely battlement, the farthest hill And wood, I think of those who have no friend; Who now, perhaps, by melancholy led, From the broad blaze of day, where pleasure flaunts, Retiring, wander to the ring-dove's haunts Unseen; and watch the tints that o'er thy bed Hang lovely; oft to musing Fancy's eye Presenting fairy vales, where the tired mind Might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind, Nor hear the hourly moans of misery! Alas for man! that Hope's fair views the while Should smile like you, and perish as they smile! TO THE RIVER ITCHIN. Itchin! when I behold thy banks again, Thy crumbling margin, and thy silver breast, On which the self-same tints still seem to rest, Why feels my heart a shivering sense of pain! Is it, that many a summer's day has past Since, in life's morn, I carolled on thy side! Is it, that oft since then my heart has sighed, As Youth, and Hope's delusive gleams, flew fast! Is it, that those who gathered on thy shore, Companions of my youth, now meet no more! Whate'er the cause, upon thy banks I bend, Sorrowing; yet feel such solace at my heart, As at the meeting of some long-lost friend, From whom, in happier hours, we wept to part. ON RESIGNING A SCHOLARSHIP OF TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD, AND RETIRING TO A COUNTRY CURACY. Farewell! a long farewell! O Poverty, Affection's fondest dream how hast thou reft! But though, on thy stern brow no trace is left Of youthful joys, that on the cold heart die, With thee a sad companionship I seek, Content, if poor;—for patient wretchedness, Tearful, but uncomplaining of distress, Who turns to the rude storm her faded cheek; And Piety, who never told her wrong; And calm Content, whose griefs no more rebel; And Genius, warbling sweet, his saddest song, When evening listens to some village knell,— Long banished from the world's insulting throng;— With thee, and thy unfriended children dwell. DOVER CLIFFS. On these white cliffs, that calm above the flood Uprear their shadowing heads, and at their feet Hear not the surge that has for ages beat, How many a lonely wanderer has stood! And, whilst the lifted murmur met his ear, And o'er the distant billows the still eve Sailed slow, has thought of all his heart must leave To-morrow; of the friends he loved most dear; Of social scenes, from which he wept to part! Oh! if, like me, he knew how fruitless all The thoughts that would full fain the past recall, Soon would he quell the risings of his heart, And brave the wild winds and unhearing tide— The World his country, and his God his guide. ON LANDING AT OSTEND. The orient beam illumes the parting oar;— From yonder azure track, emerging white, The earliest sail slow gains upon the sight, And the blue wave comes rippling to the shore. Meantime far off the rear of darkness flies: Yet 'mid the beauties of the morn, unmoved, Like one for ever torn from all he loved, Back o'er the deep I turn my longing eyes, And chide the wayward passions that rebel: Yet boots it not to think, or to complain, Musing sad ditties to the reckless main. To dreams like these, adieu! the pealing bell Speaks of the hour that stays not—and the day To life's sad turmoil calls my heart away. 1787. THE BELLS, OSTEND. How sweet the tuneful bells' responsive peal! As when, at opening morn, the fragrant breeze Breathes on the trembling sense of pale disease, So piercing to my heart their force I feel! And hark! with lessening cadence now they fall! And now, along the white and level tide, They fling their melancholy music wide; Bidding me many a tender thought recall Of summer-days, and those delightful years When from an ancient tower, in life's fair prime, The mournful magic of their mingling chime First waked my wondering childhood into tears! But seeming now, when all those days are o'er, The sounds of joy once heard, and heard no more. 1787. THE RHINE. 'Twas morn, and beauteous on the mountain's brow (Hung with the clusters of the bending vine) Shone in the early light, when on the Rhine We bounded, and the white waves round the prow In murmurs parted:—varying as we go, Lo! the woods open, and the rocks retire, As some gray convent-wall or glistening spire 'Mid the bright landscape's track unfolding slow! Here dark, with furrowed aspect, like Despair, Frowns the bleak cliff! There on the woodland's side The shadowy sunshine pours its streaming tide; Whilst Hope, enchanted with the scene so fair, Counts not the hours of a long summer's day, Nor heeds how fast the prospect winds away. INFLUENCE OF TIME ON GRIEF. O Time! who know'st a lenient hand to lay Softest on Sorrow's wound, and slowly thence (Lulling to sad repose the weary sense) The faint pang stealest unperceived away; On thee I rest my only hope at last, And think, when thou hast dried the bitter tear That flows in vain o'er all my soul held dear, I may look back on every sorrow past, And meet life's peaceful evening with a smile:— As some lone bird, at day's departing hour, Sings in the sunbeam, of the transient shower Forgetful, though its wings are wet the while:— Yet ah! how much must that poor heart endure, Which hopes from thee, and thee alone, a cure! THE CONVENT. If chance some pensive stranger, hither led, His bosom glowing from majestic views, Temple and tower 'mid the bright landscape's hues, Should ask who sleeps beneath this lowly bed? A maid of sorrow. To the cloistered scene, Unknown and beautiful a mourner came, Seeking with unseen tears to quench the flame Of hapless love: yet was her look serene As the pale moonlight in the midnight aisle;— Her voice was gentle and a charm could lend, Like that which spoke of a departed friend; And a meek sadness sat upon her smile!— Now, far removed from every earthly ill, Her woes are buried, and her heart is still. THE RIVER CHERWELL. Cherwell! how pleased along thy willowed edge Erewhile I strayed, or when the morn began To tinge the distant turret's golden fan, Or evening glimmered o'er the sighing sedge! And now reposing on thy banks once more, I bid the lute farewell, and that sad lay Whose music on my melancholy way I wooed: beneath thy willows waving hoar, Seeking a while to rest—till the bright sun Of joy return; as when Heaven's radiant Bow Beams on the night-storm's passing wings below: Whate'er betide, yet something have I won Of solace, that may bear me on serene, Till eve's last hush shall close the silent scene. ON ENTERING SWITZERLAND. Languid, and sad, and slow, from day to day I journey on, yet pensive turn to view, Where the rich landscape gleams with softer hue, The streams, and vales, and hills, that steal away. So fares it with the children of the earth: For when life's goodly prospect opens round, Their spirits burn to tread that fairy ground, Where every vale sounds to the pipe of mirth. But them, alas! the dream of youth beguiles, And soon a longing look, like me, they cast Back on the mountains of the morning past: Yet Hope still beckons us, and beckoning smiles, And to a brighter world her view extends, When earth's long darkness on her path descends. DISTANT VIEW OF ENGLAND FROM THE SEA. Yes! from mine eyes the tears unbidden start, As thee, my country, and the long-lost sight Of thy own cliffs, that lift their summits white Above the wave, once more my beating heart With eager hope and filial transport hails! Scenes of my youth, reviving gales ye bring, As when erewhile the tuneful morn of spring Joyous awoke amidst your hawthorn vales, And filled with fragrance every village lane: Fled are those hours, and all the joys they gave! Yet still I gaze, and count each rising wave That bears me nearer to my home again; If haply, 'mid those woods and vales so fair, Stranger to Peace, I yet may meet her there. HOPE. As one who, long by wasting sickness worn, Weary has watched the lingering night, and heard Unmoved the carol of the matin bird Salute his lonely porch; now first at morn Goes forth, leaving his melancholy bed; He the green slope and level meadow views, Delightful bathed with slow-ascending dews; Or marks the clouds, that o'er the mountain's head In varying forms fantastic wander white; Or turns his ear to every random song, Heard the green river's winding marge along, The whilst each sense is steeped in still delight. So o'er my breast young Summer's breath I feel, Sweet Hope! thy fragrance pure and healing incense steal! TO A FRIEND. Go, then, and join the murmuring city's throng! Me thou dost leave to solitude and tears; To busy phantasies, and boding fears, Lest ill betide thee; but 't will not be long Ere the hard season shall be past; till then Live happy; sometimes the forsaken shade Remembering, and these trees now left to fade; Nor, 'mid the busy scenes and hum of men, Wilt thou my cares forget: in heaviness To me the hours shall roll, weary and slow, Till mournful autumn past, and all the snow Of winter pale, the glad hour I shall bless That shall restore thee from the crowd again, To the green hamlet on the peaceful plain. ABSENCE. There is strange music in the stirring wind, When lowers the autumnal eve, and all alone To the dark wood's cold covert thou art gone, Whose ancient trees on the rough slope reclined Rock, and at times scatter their tresses sere. If in such shades, beneath their murmuring, Thou late hast passed the happier hours of spring, With sadness thou wilt mark the fading year; Chiefly if one, with whom such sweets at morn Or evening thou hast shared, afar shall stray. O Spring, return! return, auspicious May! But sad will be thy coming, and forlorn, If she return not with thy cheering ray, Who from these shades is gone, far, far away. BEREAVEMENT. Whose was that gentle voice, that, whispering sweet, Promised methought long days of bliss sincere! Soothing it stole on my deluded ear, Most like soft music, that might sometimes cheat Thoughts dark and drooping! 'Twas the voice of Hope. Of love, and social scenes, it seemed to speak, Of truth, of friendship, of affection meek; That, oh! poor friend, might to life's downward slope Lead us in peace, and bless our latest hours. Ah me! the prospect saddened as she sung; Loud on my startled ear the death-bell rung; Chill darkness wrapt the pleasurable bowers, Whilst Horror, pointing to yon breathless clay, “No peace be thine,” exclaimed, “away, away!” 1793. OXFORD REVISITED. I never hear the sound of thy glad bells, Oxford, and chime harmonious, but I say, Sighing to think how time has worn away, Some spirit speaks in the sweet tone that swells, Heard after years of absence, from the vale Where Cherwell winds. Most true it speaks the tale Of days departed, and its voice recalls Hours of delight and hope in the gay tide Of life, and many friends now scattered wide By many fates. Peace be within thy walls! I have scarce heart to visit thee; but yet, Denied the joys sought in thy shades,—denied Each better hope, since my poor Harriet died, What I have owed to thee, my heart can ne'er forget! IN MEMORIAM. How blessed with thee the path could I have trod Of quiet life, above cold want's hard fate, (And little wishing more) nor of the great Envious, or their proud name; but it pleased God To take thee to his mercy: thou didst go In youth and beauty to thy cold death-bed; Even whilst on dreams of bliss we fondly fed, Of years to come of comfort! Be it so. Ere this I have felt sorrow; and even now, Though sometimes the unbidden tear will start, And half unman the miserable heart, The cold dew I shall wipe from my sad brow, And say, since hopes of bliss on earth are vain, Best friend, farewell, till we do meet again! ON THE DEATH OF THE REV. WILLIAM BENWELL, M.A. Thou camest with kind looks, when on the brink Almost of death I strove, and with mild voice Didst soothe me, bidding my poor heart rejoice, Though smitten sore: Oh, I did little think That thou, my friend, wouldst the first victim fall To the stern King of Terrors! Thou didst fly, By pity prompted, at the poor man's cry; And soon thyself were stretched beneath the pall, Livid infection's prey. The deep distress Of her, who best thy inmost bosom knew, To whom thy faith was vowed, thy soul was true, What powers of faltering language shall express? As friendship bids, I feebly breathe my own, And sorrowing say, Pure spirit, thou art gone! AT MALVERN. I shall behold far off thy towering crest, Proud mountain! from thy heights as slow I stray Down through the distant vale my homeward way, I shall behold upon thy rugged breast, The parting sun sit smiling: me the while Escaped the crowd, thoughts full of heaviness May visit, as life's bitter losses press Hard on my bosom; but I shall beguile The thing I am, and think, that ev'n as thou Dost lift in the pale beam thy forehead high, Proud mountain! whilst the scattered vapours fly Unheeded round thy breast,—so, with calm brow, The shades of sorrow I may meet, and wear The smile unchanged of peace, though pressed by care! NETLEY ABBEY. Fall'n pile! I ask not what has been thy fate; But when the winds, slow wafted from the main, Through each rent arch, like spirits that complain, Come hollow to my ear, I meditate On this world's passing pageant, and the lot Of those who once majestic in their prime Stood smiling at decay, till bowed by time Or injury, their early boast forgot, They may have fall'n like thee! Pale and forlorn, Their brow, besprent with thin hairs, white as snow, They lift, still unsubdued, as they would scorn This short-lived scene of vanity and woe; Whilst on their sad looks smilingly they bear The trace of creeping age, and the pale hue of care! ASSOCIATIONS. As o'er these hills I take my silent rounds, Still on that vision which is flown I dwell, On images I loved, alas, too well! Now past, and but remembered like sweet sounds Of yesterday! Yet in my breast I keep Such recollections, painful though they seem, And hours of joy retrace, till from my dream I start, and find them not; then I could weep To think how Fortune blights the fairest flowers; To think how soon life's first endearments fail, And we are still misled by Hope's smooth tale, Who, like a flatterer, when the happiest hours Pass, and when most we call on her to stay, Will fly, as faithless and as fleet as they! MUSIC. O Harmony! thou tenderest nurse of pain, If that thy note's sweet magic e'er can heal Griefs which the patient spirit oft may feel, Oh! let me listen to thy songs again; Till memory her fairest tints shall bring; Hope wake with brighter eye, and listening seem With smiles to think on some delightful dream, That waved o'er the charmed sense its gladsome wing! For when thou leadest all thy soothing strains More smooth along, the silent passions meet In one suspended transport, sad and sweet; And nought but sorrow's softest touch remains; That, when the transitory charm is o'er, Just wakes a tear, and then is felt no more. APPROACH OF SUMMER. How shall I meet thee, Summer, wont to fill My heart with gladness, when thy pleasant tide First came, and on the Coomb's romantic side Was heard the distant cuckoo's hollow bill! Fresh flowers shall fringe the margin of the stream, As with the songs of joyance and of hope The hedge-rows shall ring loud, and on the slope The poplars sparkle in the passing beam; The shrubs and laurels that I loved to tend, Thinking their May-tide fragrance would delight, With many a peaceful charm, thee, my poor friend, Shall put forth their green shoots, and cheer the sight! But I shall mark their hues with sadder eyes, And weep the more for one who in the cold earth lies! AT OXFORD, 1786. Bereave me not of Fancy's shadowy dreams, Which won my heart, or when the gay career Of life begun, or when at times a tear Sat sad on memory's cheek—though loftier themes Await the awakened mind to the high prize Of wisdom, hardly earned with toil and pain, Aspiring patient; yet on life's wide plain Left fatherless, where many a wanderer sighs Hourly, and oft our road is lone and long, 'Twere not a crime should we a while delay Amid the sunny field; and happier they Who, as they journey, woo the charm of song, To cheer their way;—till they forget to weep, And the tired sense is hushed, and sinks to sleep. AT DOVER, 1786. Thou, whose stern spirit loves the storm, That, borne on Terror's desolating wings, Shakes the high forest, or remorseless flings The shivered surge; when rising griefs deform Thy peaceful breast, hie to yon steep, and think,— When thou dost mark the melancholy tide Beneath thee, and the storm careering wide,— Tossed on the surge of life how many sink! And if thy cheek with one kind tear be wet, And if thy heart be smitten, when the cry Of danger and of death is heard more nigh, Oh, learn thy private sorrows to forget; Intent, when hardest beats the storm, to save One who, like thee, has suffered from the wave. RETROSPECTION. I turn these leaves with thronging thoughts, and say, Alas! how many friends of youth are dead; How many visions of fair hope have fled, Since first, my Muse, we met.—So speeds away Life, and its shadows; yet we sit and sing, Stretched in the noontide bower, as if the day Declined not, and we yet might trill our lay Beneath the pleasant morning's purple wing That fans us; while aloft the gay clouds shine! Oh, ere the coming of the long cold night, Religion, may we bless thy purer light, That still shall warm us, when the tints decline O'er earth's dim hemisphere; and sad we gaze On the vain visions of our passing days! ON ACCIDENTALLY MEETING A LADY NOW NO MORE. WRITTEN MANY YEARS AFTER THE FOREGOING SONNETS. When last we parted, thou wert young and fair— How beautiful let fond remembrance say! Alas! since then old Time has stol'n away Nigh forty years, leaving my temples bare:— So hath it perished, like a thing of air, That dream of love and youth:—we now are gray; Yet still remembering youth's enchanted way, Though time has changed my look, and blanched my hair, Though I remember one sad hour with pain, And never thought, long as I yet might live, And parted long, to hear that voice again;— I can a sad, but cordial greeting, give, And for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer, Lady, as when I loved thee young and fair! ON HEARING “THE MESSIAH” PERFORMED IN GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL, SEPT. 18, 1835. Oh, stay, harmonious and sweet sounds, that die In the long vaultings of this ancient fane! Stay, for I may not hear on earth again Those pious airs—that glorious harmony; Lifting the soul to brighter orbs on high, Worlds without sin or sorrow! Ah, the strain Has died—ev'n the last sounds that lingeringly Hung on the roof ere they expired! And I, Stand in the world of strife, amidst a throng, A throng that recks not or of death, or sin! Oh, jarring scenes! to cease, indeed, ere long; The worm hears not the discord and the din; But he whose heart thrills to this angel song, Feels the pure joy of heaven on earth begin! WOODSPRING ABBEY, 1836. These walls were built by men who did a deed Of blood:—terrific conscience, day by day, Followed, where'er their shadow seemed to stay, And still in thought they saw their victim bleed, Before God's altar shrieking: pangs succeed, As dire upon their heart the deep sin lay, No tears of agony could wash away: Hence! to the land's remotest limit, speed! These walls are raised in vain, as vainly flows Contrition's tear: Earth, hide them, and thou, Sea, Which round the lone isle, where their bones repose, Dost sound for ever, their sad requiem be, In fancy's ear, at pensive evening's close, Still mumuring Miserere, Domine. LACOCK NUNNERY. JUNE 24, 1837. I stood upon the stone where Ela lay, The widowed founder of these ancient walls, Where fancy still on meek devotion calls, Marking the ivied arch, and turret gray— For her soul's rest—eternal rest—to pray; Where visionary nuns yet seem to tread, A pale dim troop, the cloisters of the dead, Though twice three hundred years have flown away! But when, with silent step and pensive mien, In weeds, as mourning for her sisters gone, The mistress of this lone monastic scene Came; and I heard her voice's tender tone, I said, Though centuries have rolled between, One gentle, beauteous nun is left, on earth, alone. ON A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE. Beautiful landscape! I could look on thee For hours, unmindful of the storm and strife, And mingled murmurs of tumultuous life. Here, all is still as fair; the stream, the tree, The wood, the sunshine on the bank: no tear, No thought of Time's swift wing, or closing night, That comes to steal away the long sweet light— No sighs of sad humanity are here. Here is no tint of mortal change; the day,— Beneath whose light the dog and peasant-boy Gambol, with look, and almost bark, of joy,— Still seems, though centuries have passed, to stay. Then gaze again, that shadowed scenes may teach Lessons of peace and love, beyond all speech. ART AND NATURE. THE BRIDGE BETWEEN CLIFTON AND LEIGH WOODS. Frown ever opposite, the angel cried, Who, with an earthquake's might and giant hand, Severed these riven rocks, and bade them stand Severed for ever! The vast ocean-tide, Leaving its roar without at his command, Shrank, and beneath the woods through the green land Went gently murmuring on, so to deride The frowning barriers that its force defied! But Art, high o'er the trailing smoke below Of sea-bound steamer, on yon summit's head Sat musing; and where scarce a wandering crow Sailed o'er the chasm, in thought a highway led; Conquering, as by an arrow from a bow, The scene's lone Genius by her elfin-thread. Clifton, 27th August 1836. PICTURE OF AN OLD MAN. Old man, I saw thee in thy garden chair Sitting in silence 'mid the shrubs and trees Of thy small cottage-croft, whilst murmuring bees Went by, and almost touched thy temples bare, Edged with a few flakes of the whitest hair. And, soothed by the faint hum of ebbing seas, And song of birds, and breath of the young breeze, Thus didst thou sit, feeling the summer air Blow gently;—with a sad still decadence, Sinking to earth in hope, but all alone. Oh! hast thou wept to feel the lonely sense Of earthly loss, musing on voices gone! Hush the vain murmur, that, without offence, Thy head may rest in peace beneath the churchyard stone. PICTURE OF A YOUNG LADY. When I was sitting, sad, and all alone, Remembering youth and love for ever fled, And many friends now resting with the dead, While the still summer's light departing shone, Like many sweet and silent summers gone; Thou camest, as a vision, with a mien And smile like those I once on earth had seen, And with a voice of that remembered tone Which I in other days, long since, had heard: Like Peace approaching, when distempers fret Most the tired spirit, thy fair form appeared; And till I die, I never shall forget,— For at thy footstep light, the gloom was cheered,— Thy look and voice, oh! gentle Margaret. HOUR-GLASS AND BIBLE. Look, Christian, on thy Bible, and that glass That sheds its sand through minutes, hours, and days, And years; it speaks not, yet, methinks, it says, To every human heart: so mortals pass On to their dark and silent grave! Alas For man! an exile upon earth he strays, Weary, and wandering through benighted ways; To-day in strength, to-morrow like the grass That withers at his feet!—Lift up thy head, Poor pilgrim, toiling in this vale of tears; That book declares whose blood for thee was shed, Who died to give thee life; and though thy years Pass like a shade, pointing to thy death-bed, Out of the deep thy cry an angel hears, And by his guiding hand thy steps to heaven are led! MILTON. ON THE BUSTS OF MILTON, IN YOUTH AND AGE, AT STOURHEAD. IN YOUTH. Milton, our noblest poet, in the grace Of youth, in those fair eyes and clustering hair, That brow untouched by one faint line of care, To mar its openness, we seem to trace The front of the first lord of human race, 'Mid thine own Paradise portrayed so fair, Ere Sin or Sorrow scathed it: such the air That characters thy youth. Shall time efface These lineaments as crowding cares assail! It is the lot of fall'n humanity. What boots it! armed in adamantine mail, The unconquerable mind, and genius high, Right onward hold their way through weal and woe, Or whether life's brief lot be high or low! IN AGE. And art thou he, now “fall'n on evil days,” And changed indeed! Yet what do this sunk cheek, These thinner locks, and that calm forehead speak! A spirit reckless of man's blame or praise,— A spirit, when thine eyes to the noon's blaze Their dark orbs roll in vain, in suffering meek, As in the sight of God intent to seek, 'Mid solitude or age, or through the ways Of hard adversity, the approving look Of its great Master; whilst the conscious pride Of wisdom, patient and content to brook All ills to that sole Master's task applied, Shall show before high heaven the unaltered mind, Milton, though thou art poor, and old, and blind! TO SIR WALTER SCOTT. ON ACCIDENTLY MEETING AND PARTING WITH SIR WALTER SCOTT, WHOM I HAD NOT SEEN FOR MANY YEARS, IN THE STREETS OF LONDON, MAY 1828. Since last I saw that countenance so mild, Slow-stealing age, and a faint line of care, Had gently touched, methought, some features there; Yet looked the man as placid as a child, And the same voice,—whilst mingled with the throng, Unknowing, and unknown, we passed along,— That voice, a share of the brief time beguiled! That voice I ne'er may hear again, I sighed At parting,—wheresoe'er our various way, In this great world,—but from the banks of Tweed, As slowly sink the shades of eventide, Oh! I shall hear the music of his reed, Far off, and thinking of that voice, shall say, A blessing rest upon thy locks of gray! ELEGY WRITTEN AT THE HOTWELLS, BRISTOL, JULY, 1789. INSCRIBED TO THE REV. W. HOWLEY. 1 The morning wakes in shadowy mantle gray, The darksome woods their glimmering skirts unfold, Prone from the cliff the falcon wheels her way, And long and loud the bell's slow chime is tolled. 2 The reddening light gains fast upon the skies, And far away the glistening vapours sail, Down the rough steep the accustomed hedger hies, And the stream winds in brightness through the vale. 3 Mark how those riven rocks on either shore Uplift their bleak and furrowed fronts on high; How proudly desolate their foreheads hoar, That meet the earliest sunbeams of the sky! 4 Bound for yon dusky mart, with pennants gay, The tall bark, on the winding water's line, Between the riven cliffs slow plies her way, And peering on the sight the white sails shine. 5 Alas! for those by drooping sickness worn, Who now come forth to meet the cheering ray; And feel the fragrance of the tepid morn Round their torn breasts and throbbing temples play! 6 Perhaps they muse with a desponding sigh On the cold vault that shall their bones inurn; Whilst every breeze seems, as it whispers by, To breathe of comfort never to return. 7 Yet oft, as sadly thronging dreams arise, Awhile forgetful of their pain they gaze, A transient lustre lights their faded eyes, And o'er their cheek the tender hectic plays. 8 The purple morn that paints with sidelong gleam The cliff's tall crest, the waving woods that ring With songs of birds rejoicing in the beam, Touch soft the wakeful nerve's according string. 9 Then at sad Meditation's silent hour A thousand wishes steal upon the heart; And, whilst they meekly bend to Heaven's high power, Ah! think 'tis hard, 'tis surely hard to part: 10 To part from every hope that brought delight, From those that loved them, those they loved so much! Then Fancy swells the picture on the sight, And softens every scene at every touch. 11 Sweet as the mellowed woods beneath the moon, Remembrance lends her soft-uniting shades; “Some natural tears she drops, but wipes them soon:”— The world retires, and its dim prospect fades! 12 Airs of delight, that soothe the aching sense; Waters of health, that through yon caverns glide; Oh! kindly yet your healing powers dispense, And bring back feeble life's exhausted tide! 13 Perhaps to these gray rocks and mazy springs Some heart may come, warmed with the purest fire; For whom bright Fancy plumes her radiant wings, And warbling Muses wake the lonely lyre. 14 Some orphan Maid, deceived in early youth, Pale o'er yon spring may hang in mute distress; Who dream of faith, of happiness, and truth, Of love—that Virtue would protect and bless. 15 Some musing Youth in silence there may bend, Untimely stricken by sharp Sorrow's dart; For friendship formed, yet left without a friend, And bearing still the arrow at his heart. 16 Such was lamented Russell's early doom, The gay companion of our stripling prime; Ev'n so he sank unwept into the tomb, And o'er his head closed the dark gulph of time. 17 Hither he came, a wan and weary guest, A softening balm for many a wound to crave; And wooed the sunshine to his aching breast, Which now seems smiling on his verdant grave! 18 He heard the whispering winds that now I hear, As, boding much, along these hills he passed; Yet ah! how mournful did they meet his ear On that sad morn he heard them for the last! 19 So sinks the scene, like a departed dream, Since late we sojourned blythe in Wykeham's bowers, Or heard the merry bells by Isis' stream, And thought our way was strewed with fairy flowers! 20 Of those with whom we played upon the lawn Of early life, in the fresh morning played; Alas! how many, since that vernal dawn, Like thee, poor Russell, 'neath the turf are laid! 21 Joyous a while they wandered hand in hand, By friendship led along the springtide plain; How oft did Fancy wake her transports bland, And on the lids the glistening tear detain! 22 I yet survive, now musing other song, Than that which early pleased my vacant years; Thinking how days and hours have passed along, Marked by much pleasure some, and some by tears! 23 Thankful, that to these verdant scenes I owe That he whom late I saw all drooping pale, Raised from the couch of sickness and of woe, Now lives with me these mantling views to hail. 24 Thankful, that still the landscape beaming bright, Of pendant mountain, or of woodland gray, Can wake the wonted sense of pure delight, And charm a while my solitary way. 25 Enough:—through the high heaven the proud sun rides, My wandering steps their silent path pursue Back to the crowded world where fortune guides: Clifton, to thy white rocks and woods adieu! MONODY ON HENRY HEADLEY. To every gentle Muse in vain allied, In youth's full early morning Headley died! Too long had sickness left her pining trace, With slow, still touch, on each decaying grace: Untimely sorrow marked his thoughtful mien! Despair upon his languid smile was seen! Yet Resignation, musing on the grave, (When now no hope could cheer, no pity save), And Virtue, that scarce felt its fate severe, And pale Affection, dropping soft a tear For friends beloved, from whom she soon must part, Breathed a sad solace on his aching heart. Nor ceased he yet to stray, where, winding wild, The Muse's path his drooping steps beguiled, Intent to rescue some neglected rhyme, Lone-blooming, from the mournful waste of time; And cull each scattered sweet, that seemed to smile Like flowers upon some long-forsaken pile. Far from the murmuring crowd, unseen, he sought Each charm congenial to his saddened thought. When the gray morn illumed the mountain's side, To hear the sweet birds' earliest song he hied; When meekest eve to the fold's distant bell Listened, and bade the woods and vales farewell, Musing in tearful mood, he oft was seen The last that lingered on the fading green. The waving wood high o'er the cliff reclined, The murmuring waterfall, the winter's wind, His temper's trembling texture seemed to suit; As airs of sadness the responsive lute. Yet deem not hence the social spirit dead, Though from the world's hard gaze his feelings fled: Firm was his friendship, and his faith sincere, And warm as Pity's his unheeded tear, That wept the ruthless deed, the poor man's fate, By fortune's storms left cold and desolate. Farewell! yet be this humble tribute paid To all his virtues, from that social shade Where once we sojourned. I, alas! remain To mourn the hours of youth, yet mourn in vain, That fled neglected. Wisely thou hast trod The better path; and that High Meed, which God Ordained for Virtue towering from the dust, Shall bless thy labours, spirit pure and just! ON MR HOWARD'S ACCOUNT OF LAZARETTOS. Mortal! who, armed with holy fortitude, The path of good right onward hast pursued; May He, to whose eternal throne on high The sufferers of the earth with anguish cry, Be thy protector! On that dreary road That leads thee patient to the last abode Of wretchedness, in peril and in pain, May He thy steps direct, thy heart sustain! 'Mid scenes, where pestilence in darkness flies; In caverns, where deserted misery lies; So safe beneath His shadow thou may'st go, To cheer the dismal wastes of human woe. O Charity! our helpless nature's pride, Thou friend to him who knows no friend beside, Is there in morning's breath, or the sweet gale That steals o'er the tired pilgrim of the vale, Cheering with fragrance fresh his weary frame, Aught like the incense of thy sacred flame? Is aught in all the beauties that adorn The azure heaven, or purple lights of morn; Is aught so fair in evening's lingering gleam, As from thine eye the meek and pensive beam That falls like saddest moonlight on the hill And distant grove, when the wide world is still! Thine are the ample views, that unconfined Stretch to the utmost walks of human kind: Thine is the spirit that with widest plan Brother to brother binds, and man to man. But who for thee, O Charity! will bear Hardship, and cope with peril and with care! Who, for thy sake, will social sweets forego For scenes of sickness, and the sights of woe! Who, for thy sake, will seek the prison's gloom, Where ghastly Guilt implores her lingering doom; Where Penitence unpitied sits, and pale, That never told to human ears her tale; Where Agony, half-famished, cries in vain; Where dark Despondence murmurs o'er her chain; Where gaunt Disease is wasted to the bone, And hollow-eyed Despair forgets to groan! Approving Mercy marks the vast design, And proudly cries—Howard, the task be thine! Already 'mid the darksome vaults profound, The inner prison deep beneath the ground, Consoling hath thy tender look appeared: In horror's realm the voice of peace is heard! Be the sad scene disclosed; fearless unfold The grating door—the inmost cell behold! Thought shrinks from the dread sight; the paly lamp Burns faint amid the infectious vapours damp; Beneath its light full many a livid mien, And haggard eye-ball, through the dusk are seen. In thought I see thee, at each hollow sound, With humid lids oft anxious gaze around. But oh! for him who, to yon vault confined, Has bid a long farewell to human kind; His wasted form, his cold and bloodless cheek, A tale of sadder sorrow seem to speak: Of friends, perhaps now mingled with the dead; Of hope, that, like a faithless flatterer, fled In the utmost hour of need; or of a son Cast to the bleak world's mercy; or of one Whose heart was broken, when the stern behest Tore him from pale affection's bleeding breast. Despairing, from his cold and flinty bed, With fearful muttering he has raised his head: What pitying spirit, what unwonted guest, Strays to this last retreat, these shades unblest? From life and light shut out, beneath this cell Long have I bid the cheering sun farewell. I heard for ever closed the jealous door, I marked my bed on the forsaken floor, I had no hope on earth, no human friend: Let me unpitied to the dust descend! Cold is his frozen heart—his eye is reared To Heaven no more—and on his sable beard The tear has ceased to fall. Thou canst not bring Back to his mournful heart the morn of spring;— Thou canst not bid the rose of health renew Upon his wasted cheek its crimson hue; But at thy look, (ere yet to hate resigned, He murmurs his last curses on mankind), At thy kind look one tender thought shall rise, And his full soul shall thank thee ere he dies! Oh ye, who list to Pleasure's vacant song, As in her silken train ye troop along; Who, like rank cowards, from affliction fly, Or, whilst the precious hours of life pass by, Lie slumbering in the sun! Awake, arise, To these instructive pictures turn your eyes; The awful view with other feelings scan, And learn from Howard what man owes to man! These, Virtue! are thy triumphs, that adorn Fitliest our nature, and bespeak us born For loftier action; not to gaze and run From clime to clime; nor flutter in the sun, Dragging a droning flight from flower to flower, Like summer insects in a gaudy hour; Nor yet o'er love-sick tales with fancy range, And cry—'Tis pitiful, 'tis wondrous strange! But on life's varied views to look around, And raise expiring sorrow from the ground:— And he who thus has borne his part assigned In the sad fellowship of human kind, Or for a moment soothed the bitter pain Of a poor brother, has not lived in vain! But 'tis not that Compassion should bestow An unavailing tear on want or woe: Lo! fairer Order rises from thy plan, Befriending virtue, and adorning man. That Comfort cheers the dark abode of pain, Where wan Disease prayed for relief in vain; That Mercy soothes the hard behest of law; That Misery smiles upon her bed of straw; That the dark felon's clan no more, combined, Murmur in murderous leagues against mankind; That to each cell, a mild yet mournful guest, Contrition comes, and calms the laboring breast, Whilst long-forgotten tears of virtue flow; Thou, generous friend of all—to thee we owe! To thee, that Pity sees her views expand To many a cheerless haunt, and distant land! Whilst warm Philanthropy extends her ray, Wide as the world, and general as the day! Howard! I view those deeds, and think how vain The triumphs of weak man, the feeble strain That Flattery brings to Conquest's crimson car, Amid the bannered host, and the proud tents of war! From realm to realm the hideous War-fiend hies Wide o'er the wasted earth; before him flies Affright, on pinions fleeter than the wind; Whilst Death and Desolation fast behind The havoc of his echoing march pursue: Meantime his steps are bathed in the warm dew Of bloodshed, and of tears;—but his dread name Shall perish—the loud clarion of his fame One day shall cease, and, wrapt in hideous gloom, Forgetfulness bestride his shapeless tomb! But bear thou fearless on;—the God of all, To whom the afflicted kneel, the friendless call, From His high throne of mercy shall approve The holy deeds of Mercy and of Love: For when the vanities of life's brief day Oblivion's hurrying wing shall sweep away, Each act by Charity and Mercy done, High o'er the wrecks of time, shall live alone, Immortal as the heavens, and beauteous bloom To other worlds, and realms beyond the tomb. THE GRAVE OF HOWARD. Spirit of Death! whose outstretched pennons dread Wave o'er the world beneath their shadow spread; Who darkly speedest on thy destined way, Midst shrieks and cries, and sounds of dire dismay; Spirit! behold thy victory! Assume A form more terrible, an ampler plume; For he, who wandered o'er the world alone, Listening to Misery's universal moan; He who, sustained by Virtue's arm sublime, Tended the sick and poor from clime to clime, Low in the dust is laid, thy noblest spoil! And Mercy ceases from her awful toil! 'Twas where the pestilence at thy command Arose to desolate the sickening land, When many a mingled cry and dying prayer Resounded to the listening midnight air, When deep dismay heard not the frequent knell, And the wan carcase festered as it fell: 'Twas there, with holy Virtue's awful mien, Amid the sad sights of that fearful scene, Calm he was found: the dews of death he dried; He spoke of comfort to the poor that cried; He watched the fading eye, the flagging breath, Ere yet the languid sense was lost in death; And with that look protecting angels wear, Hung o'er the dismal couch of pale Despair! Friend of mankind! thy righteous task is o'er; The heart that throbbed with pity beats no more. Around the limits of this rolling sphere, Where'er the just and good thy tale shall hear, A tear shall fall: alone, amidst the gloom Of the still dungeon, his long sorrow's tomb, The captive, mourning, o'er his chain shall bend, To think the cold earth holds his only friend! He who with labour draws his wasting breath On the forsaken silent bed of death, Remembering thy last look and anxious eye, Shall gaze around, unvisited, and die. Friend of mankind, farewell! These tears we shed— So nature dictates—o'er thy earthly bed; Yet we forget not, it was His high will, Who saw thee Virtue's arduous task fulfil, Thy spirit from its toil at last should rest:— So wills thy God, and what He wills is best! Thou hast encountered dark Disease's train, Thou hast conversed with Poverty and Pain, Thou hast beheld the dreariest forms of woe, That through this mournful vale unfriended go; And, pale with sympathy, hast paused to hear The saddest plaints e'er told to human ear. Go then, the task fulfilled, the trial o'er, Where sickness, want, and pain are known no more! How awful did thy lonely track appear, Enlightening Misery's benighted sphere! As when an angel all-serene goes forth To still the raging tempest of the north, The embattled clouds that hid the struggling day, Slow from his face retire in dark array; On the black waves, like promontories hung, A light, as of the orient morn, is flung, Till blue and level heaves the silent brine, And the new-lighted rocks at distance shine; Ev'n so didst thou go forth with cheering eye— Before thy glance the shades of misery fly; So didst thou hush the tempest, stilling wide Of human woe the loud-lamenting tide. Nor shall the spirit of those deeds expire, As fades the feeble spark of vital fire, But beam abroad, and cheer with lustre mild Humanity's remotest prospects wild, Till this frail orb shall from its sphere be hurled, Till final ruin hush the murmuring world, And all its sorrows, at the awful blast Of the archangel's trump, be but as shadows past! Relentless Time, that steals with silent tread, Shall tear away the trophies of the dead. Fame, on the pyramid's aspiring top, With sighs shall her recording trumpet drop; The feeble characters of Glory's hand Shall perish, like the tracks upon the sand; But not with these expire the sacred flame Of Virtue, or the good man's honoured name. Howard! it matters not, that far away From Albion's peaceful shore thy bones decay: Him it might please, by whose sustaining hand Thy steps were led through many a distant land, Thy long and last abode should there be found, Where many a savage nation prowls around: That Virtue from the hallowed spot might rise, And, pointing to the finished sacrifice, Teach to the roving Tartar's savage clan Lessons of love, and higher aims of man. The hoary chieftain, who thy tale shall hear, Pale on thy grave shall drop his faltering spear; The cold, unpitying Cossack thirst no more To bathe his burning falchion deep in gore; Relentless to the cry of carnage speed, Or urge o'er gasping heaps his panting steed! Nor vain the thought that fairer hence may rise New views of life, and wider charities. Far from the bleak Riphean mountains hoar, From the cold Don, and Wolga's wandering shore, From many a shady forest's lengthening tract, From many a dark-descending cataract, Succeeding tribes shall come, and o'er the place, Where sleeps the general friend of human race, Instruct their children what a debt they owe; Speak of the man who trode the paths of woe; Then bid them to their native woods depart, With new-born virtue stirring in their heart. When o'er the sounding Euxine's stormy tides In hostile pomp the Turk's proud navy rides, Bent on the frontiers of the Imperial Czar, To pour the tempest of vindictive war; If onward to those shores they haply steer, Where, Howard, thy cold dust reposes near, Whilst o'er the wave the silken pennants stream, And seen far off the golden crescents gleam, Amid the pomp of war, the swelling breast Shall feel a still unwonted awe impressed, And the relenting Pagan turn aside To think—on yonder shore the Christian died! But thou, O Briton! doomed perhaps to roam An exile many a year and far from home, If ever fortune thy lone footsteps leads To the wild Nieper's banks, and whispering reeds, O'er Howard's grave thou shalt impassioned bend, As if to hold sad converse with a friend. Whate'er thy fate upon this various scene, Where'er thy weary pilgrimage hath been, There shalt thou pause; and shutting from thy heart Some vain regrets that oft unbidden start, Think upon him to every lot resigned, Who wept, who toiled, and perished for mankind. For me, who musing, Howard, on thy fate, These pensive strains at evening meditate, I thank thee for the lessons thou hast taught To mend my heart, or animate my thought. I thank thee, Howard, for that awful view Of life which thou hast drawn, most sad, most true. Thou art no more! and the frail fading bloom Of this poor offering dies upon thy tomb. Beyond the transient sound of earthly praise Thy virtues live, perhaps, in seraph's lays! I, borne in thought, to the wild Nieper's wave, Sigh to the reeds that whisper o'er thy grave. SHAKSPEARE. 1 O sovereign Master! who with lonely state Dost rule as in some isle's enchanted land, On whom soft airs and shadowy spirits wait, Whilst scenes of “faerie” bloom at thy command, On thy wild shores forgetful could I lie, And list, till earth dissolved to thy sweet minstrelsy! 2 Called by thy magic from the hoary deep, Aërial forms should in bright troops ascend, And then a wondrous masque before me sweep; Whilst sounds, that the earth owned not, seem to blend Their stealing melodies, that when the strain Ceased, I should weep, and would so dream again! 3 The song hath ceased. Ah! who, pale shade, art thou, Sad raving to the rude tempestuous night! Sure thou hast had much wrong, so stern thy brow, So piteous thou dost tear thy tresses white; So wildly thou dost cry, Blow, bitter wind! Ye elements, I call not you unkind! 4 Beneath the shade of nodding branches gray, 'Mid rude romantic woods, and glens forlorn, The merry hunters wear the hours away; Rings the deep forest to the joyous horn! Joyous to all, but him, who with sad look Hangs idly musing by the brawling brook. 5 But mark the merry elves of fairy land! To the high moon's gleamy glance, They with shadowy morrice dance; Soft music dies along the desert sand; Soon at peep of cold-eyed day, Soon the numerous lights decay; Merrily, now merrily, After the dewy moon they fly. 6 The charm is wrought: I see an aged form, In white robes, on the winding sea-shore stand; O'er the careering surge he waves his wand: Hark! on the bleak rock bursts the swelling storm: Now from bright opening clouds I hear a lay, Come to these yellow sands, fair stranger, come away! 7 Saw ye pass by the weird sisters pale! Marked ye the lowering castle on the heath! Hark, hark, is the deed done—the deed of death! The deed is done:—Hail, king of Scotland, hail! I see no more;—to many a fearful sound The bloody cauldron sinks, and all is dark around. 8 Pity! touch the trembling strings, A maid, a beauteous maniac, wildly sings: They laid him in the ground so cold, Upon his breast the earth is thrown; High is heaped the grassy mould, Oh! he is dead and gone. The winds of the winter blow o'er his cold breast, But pleasant shall be his rest. 9 O sovereign Master! at whose sole command We start with terror, or with pity weep; Oh! where is now thy all-creating wand; Buried ten thousand thousand fathoms deep! The staff is broke, the powerful-spell is fled, And never earthly guest shall in thy circle tread. ABBA THULE'S LAMENT FOR HIS SON PRINCE LE BOO. I climb the highest cliff; I hear the sound Of dashing waves; I gaze intent around; I mark the gray cope, and the hollowness Of heaven, and the great sun, that comes to bless The isles again; but my long-straining eye, No speck, no shadow can, far off, descry, That I might weep tears of delight, and say, It is the bark that bore my child away! Sun, that returnest bright, beneath whose eye The worlds unknown, and out-stretched waters lie, Dost thou behold him now! On some rude shore, Around whose crags the cheerless billows roar, Watching the unwearied surges doth he stand, And think upon his father's distant land! Or has his heart forgot, so far away, These native woods, these rocks, and torrents gray, The tall bananas whispering to the breeze, The shores, the sound of these encircling seas, Heard from his infant days, and the piled heap Of holy stones, where his forefathers sleep! Ah, me! till sunk by sorrow, I shall dwell With them forgetful in the narrow cell, Never shall time from my fond heart efface His image; oft his shadow I shall trace Upon the glimmering waters, when on high The white moon wanders through the cloudless sky. Oft in my silent cave, when to its fire From the night's rushing tempest we retire, I shall behold his form, his aspect bland; I shall retrace his footsteps on the sand; And, when the hollow-sounding surges swell, Still think I listen to his echoing shell. Would I had perished ere that hapless day, When the tall vessel, in its trim array, First rushed upon the sounding surge, and bore My age's comfort from this sheltering shore! I saw it spread its white wings to the wind, Too soon it left these hills and woods behind, Gazing, its course I followed till mine eye No longer could its distant track descry; Till on the confines of the billows hoar A while it hung, and then was seen no more, And only the blue hollow cope I spied, And the long waste of waters tossing wide. More mournful then each falling surge I heard, Then dropt the stagnant tear upon my beard. Methought the wild waves said, amidst their roar At midnight, Thou shalt see thy son no more! Now thrice twelve moons through the mid heavens have rolled And many a dawn, and slow night, have I told: And still as every weary day goes by, A knot recording on my line I tie; But never more, emerging from the main, I see the stranger's bark approach again. Has the fell storm o'erwhelmed him! Has its sweep Buried the bounding vessel in the deep! Is he cast bleeding on some desert plain! Upon his father did he call in vain! Have pitiless and bloody tribes defiled The cold limbs of my brave, my beauteous child! Oh! I shall never, never hear his voice; The spring-time shall return, the isles rejoice, But faint and weary I shall meet the morn, And 'mid the cheering sunshine droop forlorn! The joyous conch sounds in the high wood loud, O'er all the beach now stream the busy crowd; Fresh breezes stir the waving plantain grove; The fisher carols in the winding cove; And light canoes along the lucid tide With painted shells and sparkling paddles glide. I linger on the desert rock alone, Heartless, and cry for thee, my son, my son. SOUTHAMPTON WATER. Smooth went our boat upon the summer seas, Leaving, for so it seemed, the world behind, Its sounds of mingled uproar: we, reclined Upon the sunny deck, heard but the breeze That o'er us whispering passed, or idly played With the lithe flag aloft. A woodland scene On either side drew its slope line of green, And hung the water's shining edge with shade. Above the woods, Netley! thy ruins pale Peered as we passed; and Vecta's azure hue Beyond the misty castle met our view; Where in mid channel hung the scarce seen sail. So all was calm and sunshine as we went Cheerily o'er the briny element. Oh! were this little boat to us the world, As thus we wandered far from sounds of care, Circled by friends and gentle maidens fair, Whilst morning airs the waving pennant curled; How sweet were life's long voyage, till in peace We gained that haven still, where all things cease! THE PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY. INSCRIBED TO THE DUKE OF LEEDS. When Want, with wasted mien and haggard eye, Retires in silence to her cell to die; When o'er her child she hangs with speechless dread, Faint and despairing of to-morrow's bread; Who shall approach to bid the conflict cease, And to her parting spirit whisper peace! Who thee, poor infant, that with aspect bland Dost stretch forth innocent thy helpless hand, Shall pitying then protect, when thou art thrown On the world's waste, unfriended and alone! O hapless Infancy! if aught could move The hardest heart to pity and to love 'Twere surely found in thee: dim passions mark Stern manhood's brow, where age impresses dark The stealing line of sorrow; but thine eye Wears not distrust, or grief, or perfidy. Though fortune's storms with dismal shadow lower, Thy heart nor fears, nor feels the bitter shower; Thy tear is soon forgotten; thou wilt weep, And then the murmuring winds will hush thy sleep, As 'twere with some sad music;—and thy smiles, Unlike to those that cover cruel wiles, Plead best thy speechless innocence, and lend A charm might win the world to be thy friend. But thou art oft abandoned in thy smiles, And early vice thy easy heart beguiles. Oh for some voice, that of the secret maze Where the grim passions lurk, the winding ways That lead to sin, and ruth, and deep lament, Might haply warn thee, whilst yet innocent And beauteous as the spring-time o'er the hills Advancing, when each vale glad music fills! Else lost and wandering, the benighted mind No spot of rest again shall ever find; Then the sweet smiles, that erst enchanting laid Their magic beauty on thy look, shall fade; Then the bird's warbled song no more shall cheer With morning music thy delighted ear; Fell thoughts and muttering passions shall awake, And the fair rose the sullied cheek forsake! As when still Autumn's gradual gloom is laid Far o'er the fading forest's saddened shade, A mournful gleam illumines the cold hill, Yet palely wandering o'er the distant rill; But when the hollow gust, slow rising, raves, And high the pine on yon lone summit waves, Each milder charm, like pictures of a dream, Hath perished, mute the birds, and dark the stream! Scuds the dreer sleet upon the whirlwind borne, And scowls the landscape clouded and forlorn! So fades, so perishes frail Virtue's hue; Her last and lingering smile seems but to rue, Like autumn, every summer beauty reft, Till all is dark and to the winter left. Yet spring, with living touch, shall paint again The green-leaved forest, and the purple plain; With mingling melody the woods shall ring, The whispering breeze its long-lost incense fling: But, Innocence! when once thy tender flower The sickly taint has touched, where is the power That shall bring back its fragrance, or restore The tints of loveliness, that shine no more? How then for thee, who pinest in life's gloom, Abandoned child! can hope or virtue bloom! For thee, exposed amid the desert drear, Which no glad gales or vernal sunbeams cheer! Though some there are, who lift their head sublime, Nor heed the transient storms of fate or time; Too oft, alas! beneath unfriendly skies, The tender blossom shrinks its leaves, and dies! Go, struggle with thy fate, pursue thy way;— Though thou art poor, the world around is gay! Thou hast no bread; but on thy aching sight Proud luxury's pavilions glitter bright; In thy cold ear the song of gladness swells, Whilst vacant folly chimes her tinkling bells: The careless crowd prolong their hollow glee, Nor one relenting bosom thinks of thee. Will not the indignant spirit then rebel, And the dark tide of passions fearful swell! Will not despight, perhaps, or bitter need, Urge then thy temper to some direful deed! Pale Guilt shall call thee to her ghastly band, Or Murder welcome thee with reeking hand! O wretched state, where our best feelings lie Deep sunk in sullen, hopeless apathy! Or wakeful cares, or gloomy terrors start, And night and tempest mingle in the heart! All mournful to the pensive sage's eye, The monuments of human glory lie; Fall'n palaces, crushed by the ruthless haste Of time, and many an empire's silent waste, Where, 'midst the vale of long-departed years, The form of desolation dim appears, Pointing to the wild plain with ruin spread, The wrecks of age, and records of the dead! But where a sight shall shuddering sorrow find, Sad as the ruins of the human mind;— As Man, by his Great Maker raised sublime Amid the universe, ordained to climb The arduous height where Virtue sits serene;— As Man, the high lord of this nether scene, So fall'n, so lost!—his noblest boast destroyed, His sweet affections left a piteous void! But oh, sweet Charity! what sounds were those That met the listening ear, soft as the close Of distant music, when the hum of day Is hushed, and dying gales the airs convey! Come, hapless orphans, meek Compassion cried, Where'er, unsheltered outcasts! ye abide The bitter driving wind, the freezing sky, The oppressor's scourge, the proud man's contumely; Come, hapless orphans! ye who never saw A tear of kindness shed on your cold straw; Who never met with joy the morning light, Or lisped your little prayer of peace at night; Come, hapless orphans! nor, when youth should spring Soaring aloft, as on an eagle's wing, Shall ye forsaken on the ground be left, Of hope, of virtue, and of peace bereft! Far from the springtide gale, and joyous day, In the deep caverns of Despair ye lay: She, iron-hearted mother, never pressed Your wasted forms with transport to her breast; When none o'er all the world your 'plaint would hear, She never kissed away the falling tear, Or fondly smiled, forgetful, to behold Some infant grace its early charm unfold. She ne'er with mingling hopes and rising fears, Sighed for the fortune of your future years: Or saw you hand in hand rejoicing stray Beneath the morning sun, on youth's delightful way. But happier scenes invite, and fairer skies; From your dark bed, children of woe, arise! In caves where peace ne'er smiled, where joy ne'er came, Where Friendship's eye ne'er glistened at the name Of one she loved, where famine and despair Sat silent 'mid the damp and lurid air, The soothing voice is heard; a beam of light Is cast upon their features, sunk and white; With trembling joy they catch the stealing sound; Their famished little ones come smiling round. Sweet Infancy! whom all the world forsook, Thou hast put on again thy cherub look: Guilt, shrinking at the sight, in deep dismay Flies cowering, and resigns his wonted prey. But who is she, in garb of misery clad, Yet of less vulgar mien? A look so sad The mourning maniac wears, so wild, yet meek; A beam of joy now wanders o'er her cheek, The pale eye visiting; it leaves it soon, As fade the dewy glances of the moon Upon some wandering cloud, while slow the ray Retires, and leaves more dark the heaven's wide way. Lost mother, early doomed to guilt and shame, Whose friends of youth now sigh not o'er thy name, Heavy has sorrow fall'n upon thy head, Yet think—one hope remains when thou art dead; Thy houseless child, thy only little one, Shall not look round, defenceless and alone, For one to guide her youth;—nor with dismay Each stranger's cold unfeeling look survey. She shall not now be left a prey to shame, Whilst slow disease preys on her faded frame; Nor, when the bloom of innocence is fled, Thus fainting bow her unprotected head. Oh, she shall live, and Piety and Truth, The loveliest ornaments, shall grace her youth. And should her eye with softest lustre shine, And should she wear such smiles as once were thine, The smiles of peace and virtue they shall prove, Blessing the calm abode of faithful love. For ye who thus, by pure compassion taught, Have wept o'er human sorrows;—who have sought Want's dismal cell, and pale as from the dead To life and light the speechless orphan led;— Trust that the deed, in Mercy's book enrolled, Approving spirits of the just behold! Meanwhile, new virtues here, as on the wing Of morn, from Sorrow's dreary shades shall spring; Young Modesty, with fair untainted bloom; And Industry, that sings beside her loom; And ruddy Labour, issuing from his hatch Ere the slant sunbeam strikes the lowly thatch; And sweet Contentment, smiling on a rock, Like a fair shepherdess beside her flock; And tender Love, that hastes with myrtle-braid To bind the tresses of the favoured maid; And Piety, with unclasped holy book, Lifting to heaven her mildly-beaming look: These village virtues on the plain shall throng, And Albion's hills resound a cheerful song; Whilst Charity, with dewy eyelids bland, Leading a lisping infant in her hand, Shall bend at pure Religion's holy shrine, And say, These children, God of Love, are thine! THE DYING SLAVE. Faint-gazing on the burning orb of day, When Afric's injured son expiring lay, His forehead cold, his labouring bosom bare, His dewy temples, and his sable hair, His poor companions kissed, and cried aloud, Rejoicing, whilst his head in peace he bowed:— Now thy long, long task is done, Swiftly, brother, wilt thou run, Ere to-morrow's golden beam Glitter on thy parent stream, Swiftly the delights to share, The feast of joy that waits thee there. Swiftly, brother, wilt thou ride O'er the long and stormy tide, Fleeter than the hurricane, Till thou see'st those scenes again, Where thy father's hut was reared, Where thy mother's voice was heard; Where thy infant brothers played Beneath the fragrant citron shade; Where through green savannahs wide Cooling rivers silent glide, Or the shrill cicalas sing Ceaseless to their murmuring; Where the dance, the festive song, Of many a friend divided long, Doomed through stranger lands to roam, Shall bid thy spirit welcome home! Fearless o'er the foaming tide Again thy light canoe shall ride; Fearless on the embattled plain Thou shalt lift thy lance again; Or, starting at the call of morn, Wake the wild woods with thy horn; Or, rushing down the mountain-slope, O'ertake the nimble antelope; Or lead the dance, 'mid blissful bands, On cool Andracte's yellow sands; Or, in the embowering orange-grove, Tell to thy long-forsaken love The wounds, the agony severe, Thy patient spirit suffered here! Fear not now the tyrant's power, Past is his insulting hour; Mark no more the sullen trait On slavery's brow of scorn and hate; Hear no more the long sigh borne Murmuring on the gales of morn! Go in peace; yet we remain Far distant toiling on in pain; Ere the great Sun fire the skies To our work of woe we rise; And see each night, without a friend, The world's great comforter descend! Tell our brethren, where ye meet, Thus we toil with weary feet; Yet tell them that Love's generous flame, In joy, in wretchedness the same, In distant worlds was ne'er forgot; And tell them that we murmur not; Tell them, though the pang will start, And drain the life-blood from the heart,— Tell them, generous shame forbids The tear to stain our burning lids! Tell them, in weariness and want, For our native hills we pant, Where soon, from shame and sorrow free, We hope in death to follow thee! SONG OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN. Stranger, stay, nor wish to climb The heights of yonder hills sublime; For there strange shapes and spirits dwell, That oft the murmuring thunders swell, Of power from the impending steep To hurl thee headlong to the deep; But secure with us abide, By the winding river's side; Our gladsome toil, our pleasures share, And think not of a world of care. The lonely cayman, where he feeds Among the green high-bending reeds, Shall yield thee pastime; thy keen dart Through his bright scales shall pierce his heart. Home returning from our toils, Thou shalt bear the tiger's spoils; And we will sing our loudest strain O'er the forest-tyrant slain! Sometimes thou shalt pause to hear The beauteous cardinal sing clear; Where hoary oaks, by time decayed, Nod in the deep wood's pathless glade; And the sun, with bursting ray, Quivers on the branches gray. By the river's craggy banks, O'erhung with stately cypress-ranks, Where the bush-bee hums his song, Thy trim canoe shall glance along. To-night at least, in this retreat, Stranger! rest thy wandering feet; To-morrow, with unerring bow, To the deep thickets fearless we will go. MONODY, WRITTEN AT MATLOCK. Matlock! amid thy hoary-hanging views, Thy glens that smile sequestered, and thy nooks Which yon forsaken crag all dark o'erlooks; Once more I court the long neglected Muse, As erst when by the mossy brink and falls Of solitary Wainsbeck, or the side Of Clysdale's cliffs, where first her voice she tried, I strayed a pensive boy. Since then, the thralls That wait life's upland road have chilled her breast, And much, as much they might, her wing depressed. Wan Indolence, resigned, her deadening hand Laid on her heart, and Fancy her cold wand Dropped at the frown of fortune; yet once more I call her, and once more her converse sweet, 'Mid the still limits of this wild retreat, I woo;—if yet delightful as of yore My heart she may revisit, nor deny The soothing aid of some sweet melody! I hail the rugged scene that bursts around; I mark the wreathed roots, the saplings gray, That bend o'er the dark Derwent's wandering way; I mark its stream with peace-persuading sound, That steals beneath the fading foliage pale, Or, at the foot of frowning crags upreared, Complains like one forsaken and unheard. To me, it seems to tell the pensive tale Of spring-time, and the summer days all flown; And while sad autumn's voice ev'n now I hear Along the umbrage of the high-wood moan, At intervals, whose shivering leaves fall sere; Whilst o'er the group of pendant groves I view The slowly-spreading tints of pining hue, I think of poor Humanity's brief day, How fast its blossoms fade, its summers speed away! When first young Hope, a golden-tressed boy, Most musical his early madrigal Sings to the whispering waters as they fall, Breathing fresh airs of fragrance and of joy, The wild woods gently wave, the morning sheds Her rising radiance on the mountain heads, Strewed with green isles appears old ocean's reign, And seen at distance rays of resting light Silver the farthest promontory's height: Then hushed is the long murmur of the main, Whilst silent o'er the slowly-crisping tides, Bound to some beaming spot, the bark of pleasure glides. Alas! the scenes that smile in light arrayed But catch the sense, and then in darkness fade. We, poor adventurers, of peace bereft, Look back on the green hills that late we left, Or turn, with beating breast and anxious eye, To some faint hope that glimmering meets our sight (Like the lone watch-tower in the storm of night), Then on the dismal waste are driv'n despairing by! Meantime, amid the landscape cold and mute, Hope, sweet enchanter, sighing drops his lute: So sad decay and mortal change succeeds, And o'er the silent scene Time, like a giant, speeds! Yet the bleak cliffs that lift their heads so high (Around whose beetling crags, with ceaseless coil, And still-returning flight, the ravens toil) Heed not the changeful seasons as they fly, Nor spring, nor autumn: they their hoary brow Uprear, and ages past, as in this now, The same deep trenches unsubdued have worn, The same majestic frown, and looks of lofty scorn. So Fortitude, a mailed warrior old, Appears; he lifts his scar-intrenched crest; The tempest gathers round his dauntless breast; He hears far off the storm of havoc rolled; The feeble fall around: their sound is past; Their sun is set, their place no more is known; Like the wan leaves before the winter's blast They perish:—He, unshaken and alone Remains, his brow a sterner shade assumes, By age ennobled, whilst the hurricane, That raves resistless o'er the ravaged plain, But shakes unfelt his helmet's quivering plume. And so yon sovereign of the scene I mark Above the woods rear his majestic head, That soon all shattered at his feet shall shed Their short-lived beauties: he the winter dark Regardless, and the wasteful time that flies, Rejoicing in his lonely might, defies. Thee, wandering in the deep and craggy dell, Sequestered stream, with other thoughts I view: Thou dost in solitude thy course pursue, As thou hadst bid life's busy scenes farewell, Yet making still such music as might cheer The weary passenger that journeys near. Such are the songs of Peace in Virtue's shade; Unheard of Folly, or the vacant train That pipe and dance upon the noontide plain, Till in the dust together they are laid! But not unheard of Him, who sits sublime Above the clouds of this tempestuous clime, Its stir and strife; to whom more grateful rise The humble incense, and the still small voice Of those that on their pensive way rejoice, Than shouts of thousands echoing to the skies; Than songs of conquest pealing round the car Of hard Ambition, or the Fiend of War, Sated with slaughter. Nor may I, sweet stream, From thy wild banks and still retreats depart, Where now I meditate my casual theme, Without some mild improvement on my heart Poured sad, yet pleasing! so may I forget The crosses and the cares that sometimes fret Life's smoothest channel, and each wish prevent That mars the silent current of content! In such a spot, amidst these rugged views, The pensive poet in his drooping age Might wish to place his reed-roofed hermitage; Where much on life's vain shadows he might muse. If fortune smiled not on his early way, If he were doomed to mourn a faithless friend, Here he might rest, and when his hairs were gray, Behold in peace the parting day descend. If a hard world his errors scanned severe, When late the earth received his mouldering clay, Perhaps some loved companion, wandering near, Plucking the gray moss from the stone, might say: Him I remember, in our careless days, Vacant and glad, till many a loss severe First hung his placid eyelids with a tear; Yet on such visions ardent would he gaze, As the Muse loved, that oft would smile and die, Like the faint bow that leaves the weeping sky; His heart unguarded, yet it proudly beat Against hard wrong, or coward cold deceit;— Nor passed he e'er without a sigh the cell Where wretchedness and her pale children dwell. He never wished to win the world's cold ear, Nor, prized by those he loved, its blame could fear; Its praise he left to those who, at their will, The ingenious strain of torturing art could trill! Content, as random fancies might inspire, If his weak reed, at times, or plaintive lyre, He touched with desultory hand, and drew Some softened tones, to Nature not untrue. The leaves, O Derwent! on thy bosom still Oft with the gust now fall—the season pale Hath smote with hand unseen the silent vale, And slowly steals the verdure from the hill; So the fair scene departs, yet wears a while The lingering traces of its beauteous smile: But we who by thy margin stray, or climb The cliff's aërial height, or join the song Of hope and gladness amidst yonder throng, Losing the brief and fleeting hours of time, Reck not how age, even thus, with icy hand, Hangs o'er us;—how, as with a wizard's wand, Youth blooming like the spring, and roseate mirth, To slow and sere consumption he shall change, And with invisible mutation strange, Withered and wasted send them to the earth; Whilst hushed, and by the mace of ruin rent, Sinks the forsaken hall of merriment! Bright bursts the sun upon the shaggy scene! The aged rocks their glittering summits gray Hang beautiful amid the beams of day; And all the woods, with slowly-fading green, Yet smiling wave:—severer thoughts, away! The night is distant, and the lovely day Looks on us yet;—the sound of mirthful cheer From yonder dome comes pleasant to mine ear. From rock to rock reverberated swells, Hark,—the glad music of the village bells! On the crag's naked point the heifer lows, And wide below the brightening landscape glows! Though brief the time and short our course to run, Derwent! amid the scenes that deck thy side, Ere yet the parting paths of life divide, Let us rejoice, seeking what may be won From the laborious day, or fortune's frown: Here may we, ere the sun of life goes down, A while regardless of the morrow, dwell; Then to our destined roads, and speed us well! THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDMUND BURKE. Why mourns the ingenuous Moralist, whose mind Science has stored, and Piety refined, That fading Chivalry displays no more Her pomp and stately tournaments of yore! Lo! when Philosophy and Truth advance, Scared at their frown, she drops her glittering lance; Round her reft castles the pale ivy crawls, And sunk and silent are her bannered halls! As when far off the golden evening sails, And slowly sink the fancy-painted vales, With rich pavilions spread in long array; So rolls the enchanter's radiant realm away; So on the sight the parting glories fade, The gorgeous vision sets in endless shade. But shall the musing mind for this lament, Or mourn the wizard's Gothic fabric rent! Shall he, with Fancy's poor and pensive child, Gaze on his shadowy vales, and prospects wild, With lingering love, and sighing bid farewell To the dim pictures of his parting spell! No, Burke! thy heart, by juster feelings led, Mourns for the spirit of high Honour fled; Mourns that Philosophy, abstract and cold, Withering should smite life's fancy-flowered mould; And many a smiling sympathy depart, That graced the sternness of the manly heart. Nor shall the wise and virtuous scan severe These fair illusions, ev'n to nature dear. Though now no more proud Chivalry recalls Her tourneys bright, and pealing festivals; Though now on high her idle spear is hung, Though Time her mouldering harp has half unstrung; Her milder influence shall she still impart, To decorate, but not disguise, the heart; To nurse the tender sympathies that play In the short sunshine of life's early way; For female worth and meekness to inspire Homage and love, and temper rude desire; Nor seldom with sweet dreams sad thoughts to cheer, And half beguile affliction of her tear! Lo! this her boast; and still, O Burke! be thine Her glowing hues that warm, yet tempered shine; Whilst whispers bland, and fairest dreams, attend Thy evening path, till the last shade descend! So may she soothe, with loftier wisdom's aid, Thy musing leisure in the silent shade, And bid poor Fancy, her cold pinions wet, Life's cloudy skies and beating showers forget. But can her fairest form, her sweetest song, Soothe thee, assailed by calumny and wrong! Ev'n now thy foes with louder accents cry: Champion of unrelenting tyranny, At Freedom hast thou aimed the deadly blow, And striven with impious arm to lay her altars low! No, Burke! indignant at the voice we start: We trust thy liberal views, thy generous heart; We think of those who, naked, pale, and poor, Relieved and blessed, have wandered from thy door; We see thee with unwearied step explore Each track of bloodshed on the farthest shore Of injured Asia, and thy swelling breast Harrowing the oppressor, mourning for the oppressed, No, Burke! where'er Injustice rears her head, Where'er with blood her idol grim is fed; Where'er fell Cruelty, at her command, With crimson banner marches through the land, And striding, like a giant, onward hies, Whilst man, a trodden worm, looks up, and dies; Where'er pale Murder in her train appears, With reeking axe, and garments wet with tears; Or, lowering Jealousy, unmoved as Fate, Bars fast the prison-cage's iron gate Upon the buried sorrows and the cries Of him who there, lost and forgotten, lies;— When ministers like these, in fearful state, Upon a bloody tyrant's bidding wait, Thou too shalt own (and Justice lift her rod) The cause of Freedom is the cause of God! Fair spirit, who dost rise in beauteous pride, Where proud Oppression hath thine arm defied! When led by Virtue thou dost firm advance, And bathe in Guilt's warm blood thy burning lance; When all thy form its awful port assumes, And in the tempest shake thy crimson plumes, I mark thy lofty mien, thy steady eye, So fall thy foes! with tears of joy I cry. But ne'er may Anarchy, with eyes a-flame, And mien distract, assume thy awful name; Her pale torch sheds afar its hideous glare, And shows the blood-drops in her dabbled hair; The fiends of discord hear her hollow voice, The spirits of the deathful storm rejoice: As when the rising blast with muttering sweep Sounds 'mid the branches of the forest deep, The sad horizon lowers, the parting sun Is hid, strange murmurs through the high wood run, The falcon wheels away his mournful flight, And leaves the glens to solitude and night; Till soon the hurricane, in dismal shroud, Comes fearful forth, and sounds her conch aloud; The oak majestic bows his hoary head, And ruin round his ancient reign is spread: So the dark fiend, rejoicing in her might, Pours desolation and the storm of night; Before her dread career the good and just Fly far, or sink expiring in the dust; Wide wastes and mighty wrecks around her lie, And the earth trembles at her impious cry! Whether her temple, wet with human gore, She thus may raise on Gallia's ravaged shore, Belongs to Him alone, and His high will, Who bids the tempests of the world be still. With joy we turn to Albion's happier plain, Where ancient Freedom holds her temperate reign; Where Justice sits majestic on her throne; Where Mercy turns her ear to every groan. O Albion! fairest isle, whose verdant plain Springs beauteous from the blue and billowy main; In peaceful pomp whose glittering cities rise, And lift their crowded temples to the skies; Whose navy on the broad brine awful rolls; Whose commerce glows beneath the distant poles; Whose streams reflect full many an Attic pile; Whose velvet lawns in long luxuriance smile; Amid whose winding coombs contentment dwells, Whose vales rejoice to hear the Sabbath bells; Whose humblest shed, that steady laws protect, The villager with woodbine bowers hath decked! Sweet native land, whose every haunt is dear, Whose every gale is music to mine ear; Amidst whose hills one poor retreat I sought, Where I might sometimes hide a saddening thought, And having wandered far, and marked mankind In their vain mask, might rest and safety find: Oh! still may Freedom, with majestic mien, Pacing thy rocks and the green vales, be seen; Around thy cliffs, that glitter o'er the main, May smiling Order wind her silver chain; Whilst from thy calm abodes, and azure skies, Far off the fiend of Discord murmuring flies! To him who firm thy injured cause has fought, This humble offering, lo! the Muse has brought; Nor heed thou, Burke, if, with averted eye, Scowling, cold Envy may thy worth decry! It is the lot of man:—the best oft mourn, As sad they journey through this cloudy bourne: If conscious Genius stamp their chosen breast, And on the forehead show her seal impressed, Perhaps they mourn, in bleak Misfortune's shade, Their age and cares with penury repaid; Their errors deeply scanned, their worth forgot, Or marked by hard injustice with a blot. If high they soar, and keep their distant way, And spread their ample pinions to the day, Malignant Faction hears with hate their name, And all her tongues are busy with their fame. But 'tis enough to hold, as best we may, Our destined track, till sets the closing day; Whether with living lustre we adorn Our high sphere, like the radiance of the morn; Or whether silent in the shade we move, Cheered by the lonely star of pensive love; Or whether wild opposing storms we stem, Panting for Virtue's distant diadem; 'Tis the unshaken mind, the conscience pure, That bids us firmly act, meekly endure; 'Tis this may shield us when the storm beats hard, Content, though poor, had we no other guard! ON LEAVING A PLACE OF RESIDENCE. If I could bid thee, pleasant shade, farewell Without a sigh, amidst whose circling bowers My stripling prime was passed, and happiest hours, Dead were I to the sympathies that swell The human breast! These woods, that whispering wave, My father reared and nursed, now to the grave Gone down; he loved their peaceful shades, and said, Perhaps, as here he mused: Live, laurels green; Ye pines that shade the solitary scene, Live blooming and rejoice! When I am dead My son shall guard you, and amid your bowers, Like me, find shelter from life's beating showers. These thoughts, my father, every spot endear; And whilst I think, with self-accusing pain, A stranger shall possess the loved domain, In each low wind I seem thy voice to hear. But these are shadows of the shaping brain That now my heart, alas! can ill sustain: We must forget—the world is wide—the abode Of peace may still be found, nor hard the road. It boots not, so, to every chance resigned, Where'er the spot, we bear the unaltered mind. Yet, oh! poor cottage, and thou sylvan shade, Remember, ere I left your coverts green, Where in my youth I mused, in childhood played, I gazed, I paused, I dropped a tear unseen, That bitter from the font of memory fell, Thinking on him who reared you; now, farewell! ELEGIAC STANZAS. WRITTEN DURING SICKNESS AT BATH. 1 When I lie musing on my bed alone, And listen to the wintry waterfall; And many moments that are past and gone, Moments of sunshine and of joy, recall; 2 Though the long night is dark and damp around, And no still star hangs out its friendly flame; And the winds sweep the sash with sullen sound, And freezing palsy creeps o'er all my frame; 3 I catch consoling phantasies that spring From the thick gloom, and as the night airs beat, They touch my heart, like wind-swift wires that ring In mournful modulations, strange and sweet. 4 Was it the voice of thee, my buried friend? Was it the whispered vow of faithful love? Do I in Knoyle's green shades thy steps attend, And hear the high pines murmur thus above? 5 'Twas not thy voice, my buried friend!—Oh, no: 'Twas not, O Knoyle! the murmur of thy trees; But at the thought I feel my bosom glow, And woo the dream whose air-drawn shadows please. 6 And I can think I see the groves again, The larches that yon peaceful roof embower; The airy down, the cattle-speckled plain, And the slant sunshine on the village tower. 7 And I can think I hear its Sabbath chime Come smoothly softened down the woody vale; Or mark on yon lone eminence sublime, Fast whirling in the wind, the white mill's sail. 8 Phantom, that by my bed dost beckoning glide, Spectre of Death, to the damp charnel hie! Thy dim pale hand, thy festering visage hide; Thou com'st to say, I with thy worms shall lie! 9 Thou com'st to say that my once vacant mind Amid those scenes shall never more rejoice; Nor on the day of rest the hoary hind Bend o'er his staff, attentive to my voice. 10 Hast thou not visited that pleasant place Where in this hard world I have happiest been? And shall I tremble at thy lifted mace That hath pierced all on which life seemed to lean? 11 But Hope might whisper: Many a smiling day And many a cheerful eve may yet be mine, Ere age's autumn strew my locks with gray, And weary to the dust my steps decline. 12 I argue not, but uncomplaining bow To Heaven's high 'hest; secure, whate'er my lot, Meek spirit of resigned Content, that thou Wilt smooth my pillow, and forsake me not! 13 Thou to the turfy hut with pilgrim feet Wanderest, from halls of loud tumultuous joy; Or on the naked down, when the winds beat, Dost sing to the forsaken shepherd boy. 14 Thou art the sick man's nurse, the poor man's friend, And through each change of life thou hast been mine; In every ill thou canst a comfort blend, And bid the eye, though sad, in sadness shine. 15 Thee I have met on Cherwell's willowed side, And when our destined road far onward lay, Thee I have found, whatever chance betide, The kind companion of my devious way. 16 With thee unwearied have I loved to roam, By the smooth-flowing Scheldt, or rushing Rhine; And thou hast gladdened my sequestered home, And hung my peaceful porch with eglantine. 17 When cares and crosses my tired spirits tried, When to the dust my father I resigned; Amidst the quiet shade unseen I sighed, And, blest with thee, forgot a world unkind. 18 Ev'n now, while toiling through the sleepless night, A tearful look to distant scenes I cast, And the glad objects that once charmed my sight Remember, like soft views of “faerie” past; 19 I see thee come half-smiling to my bed, With Fortitude more awfully severe, Whose arm sustaining holds my drooping head, Who dries with her dark locks the tender tear. 20 O firmer Spirit! on some craggy height Who, when the tempest sails aloft, dost stand, And hear'st the ceaseless billows of the night Rolling upon the solitary strand; 21 At this sad hour, when no harsh thoughts intrude To mar the melancholy mind's repose, When I am left to night and solitude, And languid life seems verging to its close; 22 Oh, let me thy pervading influence feel; Be every weak and wayward thought repressed; And hide thou, as with plates of coldest steel, The faded aspect and the throbbing breast! 23 Silent the motley pageant may retreat, And vain mortality's brief scenes remove; Yet let my bosom, whilst with life it beat, Breathe a last prayer for all on earth I love. 24 Slow-creeping pain weighs down my heavy eye, A chiller faintness steals upon my breast; “O gentle Muse, with some sweet lullaby” Rock me in long forgetfulness to rest! ON LEAVING WINCHESTER SCHOOL. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1782. The spring shall visit thee again, Itchin! and yonder ancient fane, That casts its shadow on thy breast, As if, by many winters beat, The blooming season it would greet, With many a straggling wild-flower shall be dressed. But I, amid the youthful train That stray at evening by thy side, No longer shall a guest remain, To mark the spring's reviving pride. I go not unrejoicing; but who knows, When I have shared, O world! thy common woes, Returning I may drop some natural tears; As these same fields I look around, And hear from yonder dome the slow bell sound, And think upon the joys that crowned my stripling years! HOPE, AN ALLEGORICAL SKETCH. But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair, What was thy delightful measure? Collins. I am the comforter of them that mourn; My scenes well shadowed, and my carol sweet, Cheer the poor passengers of life's rude bourne, Till they are sheltered in that last retreat, Where human toils and troubles are forgot. These sounds I heard amid this mortal road, When I had reached with pain one pleasant spot, So that for joy some tears in silence flowed; I raised mine eyes, sickness had long depressed, And felt thy warmth, O sun! come cheering to my breast. The storm of night had ceased upon the plain, When thoughtful in the forest-walk I strayed, To the long hollow murmur of the main Listening, and to the many leaves that made A drowsy cadence, as the high trees waved; When straight a beauteous scene burst on my sight; Smooth were the waters that the lowland laved: And lo! a form, as of some fairy sprite, Who held in her right hand a budding spray, And like a sea-maid sung her sweetly warbled lay. Soothing as steals the summer-wave she sung: The grisly phantoms of the night are gone To hear in shades forlorn the death-bell rung; But thou whom sickness hast left weak and wan, Turn from their spectre-terrors the green sea That whispers at my feet, the matin gale That crisps its shining marge shall solace thee, And thou my long-forgotten voice shalt hail, For I am Hope, whom weary hearts confess The soothest sprite that sings on life's long wilderness. As slowly ceased her tender voice, I stood Delighted: the hard way, so lately passed, Seemed smooth; the ocean's bright extended flood Before me stretched; the clouds that overcast Heaven's melancholy vault hurried away, Driven seaward, and the azure hills appeared; The sunbeams shone upon their summits gray, Strange saddening sounds no more by fits were heard, But birds, in new leaves shrouded, sung aloft, And o'er the level seas Spring's healing airs blew soft. As when a traveller, who many days Hath journeyed 'mid Arabian deserts still, A dreary solitude far on surveys, And met, nor flitting bird, nor gushing rill, But near some marble ruin, gleaming pale, Sighs mindful of the haunts of cheerful man, And thinks he hears in every sickly gale The bells of some approaching caravan; At length, emerging o'er the dim tract, sees Damascus' golden fanes, and minarets, and trees: So beat my bosom when my winding way Led through the thickets to a sheltered vale, Where the fair syren sat; a smooth clear bay Skirted with woods appeared, where many a sail Went shining o'er the watery surface still, Lessening at last in the gray ocean flood; And yonder, half-way up the fronting hill, Peeping from forth the trees, a cottage stood, Above whose peaceful umbrage, trailing high, A little smoke went up, and stained the cloudless sky. I turned, and lo! a mountain seemed to rise, Upon whose top a spiry citadel Lifted its dim-seen turrets to the skies, Where some high lord of the domain might dwell; And onward, where the eye scarce stretched its sight, Hills over hills in long succession rose, Touched with a softer and yet softer light, And all was blended as in deep repose; The woods, the sea, the hills that shone so fair, Till woods, and sea, and hills seemed fading into air. At once, methought, I saw a various throng To this enchanting spot their footsteps bend; All drawn, sweet Hope! by thy inspiring song, Which melodies scarce mortal seem to blend. First buxom Youth, with cheeks of glowing red, Came lightly tripping o'er the morning dew, He wore a harebell garland on his head, And stretched his hands at the bright-bursting view: A mountain fawn went bounding by his side, Around whose slender neck a silver bell was tied. Then said I: Mistress of the magic song, Oh, pity 'twere that hearts that know no guile Should ever feel the pangs of truth or wrong! She heeded not, but sang with lovelier smile: Enjoy, O youth, the season of thy May; Hark, how the throstles in the hawthorn sing! The hoary Time, that resteth night nor day, O'er the earth's shade may speed with noiseless wing; But heed not thou; snatch the brief joys that rise, And sport beneath the light of these unclouded skies. His fine eye flashing an unwonted fire, Then Fancy o'er the glade delighted went; He struck at times a small and silver lyre, Or gazed upon the rolling element; Sometimes he took his mirror, which did show The various landscape lovelier than the life; Beaming more bright the vivid tints did glow, And so well mingled was the colours' strife, That the fond heart, the beauteous shades once seen, Would sigh for such retreats, for vales and woods so green! Gay was his aspect, and his airy vest, As loose it flowed, such colours did display, As paint the clouds reposing in the west, Or the moist rainbow's radiant arch inlay; And now he tripped, like fairy of the wood, And seemed with dancing spirits to rejoice, And now he hung his head in pensive mood: Meantime, O Hope! he listened to thy voice, And whilst of joy and youth it cheerly sung, He touched his answering harp, and o'er the valley sprung. Pleasure, a frolic nymph, to the glad sound Came dancing, as all tears she might forget; And now she gazed with a sweet archness round, And wantonly displayed a silken net: She won her way with fascinating air— Her eyes illumined with a tender light, Her smile's strange blandishment, her shaded hair That lengthening hung, her teeth as ivory white, That peeped from her moist lip, seemed to inspire Tumultuous wishes warm, and dreams of fond desire. What softer passions did thy bosom move, When those melodious measures met thine ear, Child of Sincerity, and virtuous Love! Thine eyes did shine beneath a blissful tear That still were turned towards the tranquil scene, Where the thin smoke rose from the embowered cot; And thou didst think, that there, with smile serene, In quiet shades, and every pang forgot, Thou mightest sink on pure Affection's breast, And listen to the winds that whispered thee to rest. I thought, O Love, how seldom art thou found Without annoyance in this earthly state! For, haply, thou dost feed some rankling wound, Or on thy youth pale poverty doth wait, Till years, on heavy wing, have rolled away; Or where thou most didst hope firm faith to see, Thou meetest fickleness estranged and cold; Or if some true and tender heart there be, On which, through every change, thy soul might trust, Death comes with his fell dart, and smites it to the dust! But lusty Enterprise, with looks of glee, Approached the drooping youth, as he would say, Come to the high woods and the hills with me, And cast thy sullen myrtle-wreath away. Upon a neighing courser he did sit, That stretched its arched neck, in conscious pride, And champed as with disdain a golden bit, But Hope her animating voice applied, And Enterprise with speed impetuous passed, Whilst the long vale returned his wreathed bugle's blast. Suddenly, lifting high his ponderous spear, A mailed man came forth with scornful pride, I saw him, towering in his proud career, Along the valley with a giant stride: Upon his helm, in letters of bright gold, That to the sun's meridian splendour shone, Ambition's name far off I might behold. Meantime from earth there came a hollow moan; But Fame, who followed, her loud trumpet blew, And to the murmuring beach with eyes a-flame he flew. And now already had he gained the strand, Where a tall vessel rode with sail unfurled, And soon he thought to reach the farther land, Which to his eager eye seemed like a world That he by strength might win and make his own; And in that citadel, which shone so bright, Seat him, a purple sovereign, on his throne. So he went tilting o'er the waters white, And whilst he oft looked back with stern disdain, In louder tone, methought, was heard the inspiring strain: By the shade of cities old, By many a river stained with gore, By the sword of Sesac bold, Who smote the nations from the shore Of ancient Nile to India's farthest plain, By Fame's proud pillars, and by Valour's shield By mighty chiefs in glorious battle slain, Assert thy sway; amid the bloody field Pursue thy march, and to the heights sublime Of Honour's glittering cliffs, a mighty conqueror climb! Then said I, in my heart: Man, thou dost rear Thine eye to heaven, and vaunt thy lofty worth; The ensign of dominion thou dost bear O'er nature's works; but thou dost oft go forth, Urged by proud hopes to ravage and destroy, Thou dost build up a name by cruel deeds; Whilst to the peaceful scenes of love and joy, Sorrow, and crime, and solitude, succeeds. Hence, when her war-song Victory doth sing, Destruction flaps aloft her iron-hurtling wing. But see, as one awakened from a trance, With hollow and dim eyes and stony stare, Captivity with faltering step advance! Dripping and knotted was her coal-black hair; For she had long been hid, as in the grave; No sounds the silence of her prison broke, Nor one companion had she in her cave, Save Terror's dismal shape, that no word spoke; But to a stony coffin on the floor With lean and hideous finger pointed evermore. The lark's shrill song, the early village chime, The upland echo of the winding horn, The far-heard clock that spoke the passing time, Had never pierced her solitude forlorn; At length, released from the deep dungeon's gloom, She feels the fragrance of the vernal gale; She sees more sweet the living landscape bloom, And while she listens to Hope's tender tale, She thinks her long-lost friends shall bless her sight, And almost faints with joy amid the broad daylight. And near the spot, as with reluctant feet, Slowly desponding Melancholy drew, The wind and rain her naked breast had beat, Sunk was her eye, and sallow was her hue: In the huge forest's unrejoicing shade Bewildered had she wandered day by day, And many a grisly fiend her heart dismayed, And cold and wet upon the ground she lay; But now such sounds with mellow sweetness stole, As lapped in dreams of bliss her slow-consenting soul. Next, to the woody glen poor Mania strayed, Most pale and wild, yet gentle was her look; A slender garland she of straw had made, Of flowers and rushes from the running brook; But as she sadly passed, the tender sound Of its sharp pang her wounded heart beguiled; She dropped her half-made garland on the ground, And then she sighed, and then in tears she smiled: But in such sort, that Pity would have said, O God, be merciful to that poor hapless maid! Now ravingly she cried: The whelming main— The wintry wave rolls over his cold head; I never shall behold his form again; Hence flattering fancies—he is dead, is dead! Perhaps on some wild shore he may be cast, Where on their prey barbarians howling rush, Oh, fiercer they, than is the whelming blast! Hush, my poor heart! my wakeful sorrows, hush! He lives! I yet shall press him to my heart, And cry, Oh no, no, no,—we never more will part! So sang she, when despairing, from his cell, Hid furthest in the lone umbrageous wood, Where many a winter he had loved to dwell, Came grim Remorse; fixed in deep thought he stood, His senses pierced by the unwonted tone; Some stagnant blood-drops from his locks he shook; He saw the trees that waved, the sun that shone, He cast around an agonised look; Then with a ghastly smile, that spoke his pain, He hied him to his cave in thickest shades again. And now the sun sank westward, and the sky Was hung with thousand lucid pictures gay; When gazing on the seene with placid eye, An ancient man appeared in amice gray; His sandal shoes were by long travel worn, O'er hill and valley, many a weary mile, Yet drooped he not, like one in years forlorn; His pale cheek wore a sad, but tender smile; 'Twas sage Experience, by his look confessed, And white as frost his beard descended to his breast. Thus said I: Master, pleasant is this place, And sweet are those melodious notes I hear, And happy they among man's toiling race Who, of their cares forgetful, wander near; Me they delight, whom sickness and slow pain Have bowed almost to death with heavy hand; The fairy scenes refresh my heart again, And, pleased, I listen to that music bland, Which seems to promise hours of joy to come, And bids me tranquil seek my poor but peaceful home. He said: Alas! these shadows soon may fly, Like the gay creatures of the element; Yet do poor mortals still with raptured eye Behold like thee the pictures they present; And, charmed by Hope's sweet music, on they fare, And think they soon shall reach that blissful goal, Where never more the sullen knell of Care For buried friends and severed loves shall toll: So on they fare, till all their troubles cease, And on a lap of earth they lie them down in peace. But not there ceases their immortal claim; From golden clouds I heard a small voice say: Wisdom rejoiceth in a higher aim, Nor heeds the transient shadows of a day; These earthly sounds may die away, and all These perishable pictures sink in night, But Virtue from the dust her sons shall call, And lead them forth to joy, and life, and light; Though from their languid grasp earth's comforts fly, And with the silent worm their buried bodies lie. For other scenes there are; and in a clime Purer, and other strains to earth unknown, Where heaven's high host, with symphonies sublime, Sing unto Him that sitteth on the throne. Enough for man, if he the task fulfil Which God ordained, and to his journey's end Bear him right on, betide him good or ill; Then Hope to soothe his death-bed shall descend, Nor leave him, till in mansions of the blest He gains his destined home, his everlasting rest. THE BATTLE OF THE NILE. Shout! for the Lord hath triumphed gloriously! Upon the shores of that renowned land, Where erst His mighty arm and outstretched hand He lifted high, And dashed, in pieces dashed the enemy;— Upon that ancient coast, Where Pharaoh's chariot and his host He cast into the deep, Whilst o'er their silent pomp He bid the swoll'n sea sweep; Upon that eastern shore, That saw His awful arm revealed of yore, Again hath He arisen, and opposed His foes' defying vaunt: o'er them the deep hath closed! Shades of mighty chiefs of yore, Who triumphed on the self-same shore: Ammon, who first o'er ocean's empire wide Didst bid the bold bark stem the roaring tide; Sesac, who from the East to farthest West Didst rear thy pillars over realms subdued; And thou, whose bones do rest In the huge pyramid's dim solitude, Beneath the uncouth stone, Thy name and deeds unknown; And Philip's glorious son, With conquest flushed, for fields and cities won; And thou, imperial Cæsar, whose sole sway The long-disputed world at length confessed, When on these shores thy bleeding rival lay! Oh, could ye, starting from your long cold rest, Burst Death's oblivious trance, And once again with plumed pride advance, How would ye own your fame surpassed, And on the sand your trophies cast, When, the storm of conflict o'er, And ceased the burning battle's roar, Beneath the morning's orient light, Ye saw, with sails all swelling white, Britain's proud fleet, to many a joyful cry, Ride o'er the rolling surge in awful sovereignty! For fierce Ambition fired your mind— Beside your glittering car, Amid the thickest war, Went Superstition, sorceress blind, In dimly-figured robe, with scowling mien, Half hid in jealous hood; And Tyranny, beneath whose helm was seen His eye suffused with blood; And giant Pride, That the great sun with haughty smile defied; And Avarice, that grasped his guilty gold; These, as the sorceress her loud sistrum rung, Their dismal pæan sung; And still, far off, pale Pity hung her head, Whilst o'er the dying and the dead The victor's brazen wheels with gory axle rolled. Now look on him, in holy courage bold; The asserter of his country's cause behold! He lifts his gaze to heaven, serenely brave, And whilst around war's fearful banners wave, He prays: Protect us, as our cause is just; For in thy might alone, Judge of the world, we trust! And they are scattered—the destroyers die! They that usurped the bloody victor's claim, That spoke of freedom; but, behold a cry! They, that like a wasteful flame, Or the huge sandy pillar, that amain Whirls 'mid the silence of the desert plain, Deathful in their career of terror came, And scattered ruin as they passed! So rush they, like the simoom's horrid blast; They sweep, and all around is wilderness! But from thy throne on high, Thou, God, hast heard the cry Of nations in distress! Britain goes forth, beneath thy might, To quell the proud blasphemers in the fight; And Egypt, far along her winding main, Echoes the shout of joy, and genuine Freedom's strain! Now let them, who thy name, O God! defy, Invoke the mighty Prophet of the East; Or deck, as erst, the mystic feast To Ashtaroth, queen of the starry sky! Let them, in some cavern dark, Seek Osiris' buried ark; Or call on Typhon, of gigantic form, Lifting his hundred arms, and howling 'mid the storm! Or to that grisly king In vain their cymbals let them ring, To him in Tophet's vale revered (With smoke his brazen idol smeared), Grim Moloch, in whose fuming furnace blue The unpitying priest the shrieking infant threw, Whilst to shrill cries, and drums' and timbrels' sound, The frantic and unhearing troop danced round; To him despairing let them go, And tell their fearful tale of hideous overthrow! Calm breathed the airs along the evening bay, Where, all in warlike pride, The Gallic squadron stretched its long array; And o'er the tranquil tide With beauteous bend the streamers waved on high But, ah! how changed the scene ere night descends! Hark to the shout that heaven's high concave rends! Hark to that dying cry! Whilst, louder yet, the cannon's roar Resounds along the Nile's affrighted shore, Where, from his oozy bed, The cowering crocodile hath raised his head! What bursting flame Lightens the long track of the gleamy brine! From yon proud ship it came, That towered the leader of the hostile line! Now loud explosion rends the midnight air! Heard ye the last deep groaning of despair? Heaven's fiery cope unwonted thunders fill, Then, with one dreadful pause, earth, air, and seas are still! But now the mingled fight Begins its awful strife again! Through the dun shades of night Along the darkly-heaving main Is seen the frequent flash; And many a towering mast with dreadful crash Rings falling. Is the scene of slaughter o'er? Is the death-cry heard no more? Lo! where the East a glimmering freckle streaks, Slow o'er the shadowy wave the gray dawn breaks. Behold, O Sun, the flood Strewed with the dead, and dark with blood! Behold, all scattered on the rocking tide, The wrecks of haughty Gallia's pride! But Britain's floating bulwarks, with serene And silent pomp, amid the deathful scene Move glorious, and more beautiful display Their ensigns streaming to thy orient ray. Awful Genius of the land! Who (thy reign of glory closed) By marble wrecks, half-hid in sand, Hast mournfully reposed; Who long, amid the wasteful desert wide, Hast loved with death-like stillness to abide; Or wrapped in tenfold gloom, From noise of human things for ages hid, Hast sat upon the shapeless tomb In the forlorn and dripping pyramid; Awake! Arise! Though thou behold the day no more That saw thy pride and pomp of yore; Though, like the sounds that in the morning ray Trembled and died away From Memnon's statue; though, like these, the voice That bade thy vernal plains rejoice, The voice of Science, is no longer heard; And all thy gorgeous state hath disappeared: Yet hear, with triumph, and with hope again, The shouts of joy that swell from thy forsaken main! And, oh! might He, at whose command Deep darkness shades a mourning land; At whose command, bursting from night, And flaming with redoubled light, The Sun of Science mounts again, And re-illumes the wide-extended plain! Might He, from this eventful day, Illustrious Egypt, to thy shore Science, Freedom, Peace restore, And bid thy crowded ports their ancient pomp display! No more should Superstition mark, In characters uncouth and dark, Her dreary, monumental shrine! No more should meek-eyed Piety Outcast, insulted lie Beneath the mosque, whose golden crescents shine, But starting from her trance, O'er Nubia's sands advance Beyond the farthest fountains of the Nile! The dismal Gallas should behold her smile, And Abyssinia's inmost rocks rejoice To hear her awful lore, yet soft consoling voice! Hasten, O God! the time, when never more Pale Pity, from her moonlight seat shall hear, And dropping at the sound a fruitless tear, The far-off battle's melancholy roar; When never more Horror's portentous cry Shall sound amid the troubled sky; Or dark Destruction's grimly-smiling mien, Through the red flashes of the fight be seen! Father in heaven! our ardent hopes fulfil; Thou speakest “Peace,” and the vexed world is still! Yet should Oppression huge arise, And with bloody banners spread, Upon the gasping nations tread, Whilst he thy name defies, Trusting in Thee alone, we hope to quell His furious might, his purpose fell; And as the ensigns of his baffled pride O'er the seas are scattered wide, We will take up a joyous strain and cry— Shout! for the Lord hath triumphed gloriously! A GARDEN-SEAT AT HOME. Oh, no; I would not leave thee, my sweet home, Decked with the mantling woodbine and the rose, And slender woods that the still scene inclose, For yon magnificent and ample dome That glitters in my sight! yet I can praise Thee, Arundel, who, shunning the thronged ways Of glittering vice, silently dost dispense The blessings of retired munificence. Me, a sequestered cottage, on the verge Of thy outstretched domain, delights; and here I wind my walks, and sometimes drop a tear O'er Harriet's urn, scarce wishing to emerge Into the troubled ocean of that life, Where all is turbulence, and toil, and strife. Calm roll the seasons o'er my shaded niche; I dip the brush, or touch the tuneful string, Or hear at eve the unscared blackbirds sing; Enough if, from their loftier sphere, the rich Deign my abode to visit, and the poor Depart not, cold and hungry, from my door. Donhead, Oct. 12, 1798. IN HORTO REV. J. STILL, APUD KNOYLE, VILLAM AMŒNISSIMAM. Stranger! a while beneath this aged tree Rest thee, the hills beyond, and flowery meads, Surveying; and if Nature's charms may wake A sweet and silent transport at thine heart, In spring-time, whilst the bee hums heedless nigh, Rejoice! for thee the verdant spot is dressed, Circled with laurels green, and sprinkled o'er With many a budding rose: the shrubs all ring To the birds' warblings, and by fits the air Whispers amid the foliage o'er thine head! Rejoice, and oh! if life's sweet spring be thine, So gather its brief rose-buds, and deceive The cares and crosses of humanity. GREENWICH HOSPITAL. Come to these peaceful seats, and think no more Of cold, of midnight watchings, or the roar Of Ocean, tossing on his restless bed! Come to these peaceful seats, ye who have bled For honour, who have traversed the great flood, Or on the battle's front with stern eye stood, When rolled its thunder, and the billows red Oft closed, with sudden flashings, o'er the dead! Oh, heavy are the sorrows that beset Old age! and hard it is—hard to forget The sunshine of our youth, our manhood's pride! But here, O aged men! ye may abide Secure, and see the last light on the wave Of Time, which wafts you silent to your grave; Like the calm evening ray, that smiles serene Upon the tranquil Thames, and cheers the sinking scene. A RUSTIC SEAT NEAR THE SEA. To him, who, many a night upon the main, At mid-watch, from the bounding vessel's side, Shivering, has listened to the rocking tide, Oh, how delightful smile thy views again, Fair Land! the sheltered hut, and far-seen mill That safe sails round and round; the tripping rill That o'er the gray sand glitters; the clear sky, Beneath whose blue vault shines the village tower, That high elms, swaying in the wind, embower; And hedge-rows, where the small birds' melody Solace the lithe and loitering peasant lad! O Stranger! is thy pausing fancy sad At thought of many evils which do press On wide humanity!—Look up; address The God who made the world; but let thy heart Be thankful, though some heavy thoughts have part, That, sheltered from the human storms' career, Thou meetest innocence and quiet here. WARDOUR CASTLE. If rich designs of sumptuous art may please, Or Nature's loftier views, august and old, Stranger! behold this spreading scene;—behold This amphitheatre of aged trees, That solemn wave above thee, and around Darken the towering hills! Dost thou complain That thou shouldst cope with penury or pain, Or sigh to think what pleasures might be found Amid such wide possessions!—Pause awhile; Imagine thou dost see the sick man smile; See the pale exiles, that in yonder dome, Safe from the wasteful storm, have found a home; And thank the Giver of all good, that lent To the humane, retired, beneficent, The power to bless. Nor lift thy heart elate, If such domains be thine; but emulate The fair example, and those deeds, that rise Like holy incense wafted to the skies; Those deeds that shall sustain the conscious soul, When all this empty world hath perished, like a scroll! POLE-VELLUM, CORNWALL. A PICTURESQUE COTTAGE AND GROUNDS BELONGING TO J. LEMON, ESQ. Stranger! mark this lovely scene, When the evening sets serene, And starting o'er the silent wood, The last pale sunshine streaks the flood, And the water gushing near Soothes, with ceaseless drip, thine ear; Then bid each passion sink to rest;— Should ev'n one wish rise in thy breast, One tender wish, as now in mine, That some such quiet spot were thine, And thou, recalling seasons fled, Couldst wake the slumbers of the dead, And bring back her you loved, to share With thee calm peace and comfort there;— Oh, check the thought, but inly pray To He, “who gives and takes away,” That many years this fair domain Its varied beauties may retain;— So when some wanderer, who has lost His heart's best treasure, who has crossed In life bleak hills and passes rude, Should gain this lovely solitude; Delighted he may pause a while, And when he marks the landscape smile, Leave with its willows, ere he part, The blessings of a softened heart. July 1786. ON A BEAUTIFUL SPRING, FORMING A COLD BATH, AT COOMBE, NEAR DONHEAD, BELONGING TO MY BROTHER, CHAS. BOWLES, ESQ. Fountain, that sparklest through the shady place, Making a soft, sad murmur o'er the stones That strew thy lucid way! Oh, if some guest Should haply wander near, with slow disease Smitten, may thy cold springs the rose of health Bring back, and the quick lustre to his eye! The ancient oaks that on thy margin wave, The song of birds, and through the rocky cave The clear stream gushing, their according sounds Should mingle, and, like some strange music, steal Sadly, yet soothing, o'er his aching breast. And thou, pale exile from thy native shores, Here drink,—oh, couldst thou!—as of Lethe's stream! Nor friends, nor bleeding country, nor the views Of hills or streams beloved, nor vesper bell, Heard in the twilight vale, remember more! A CENOTAPH, TO THE MEMORY OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ISAAC, WHO DIED AT CAPE ST NICHOLA MOLE, 1797. Oh, hadst thou fall'n, brave youth! on that proud day, When our victorious fleet o'er the red surge Rolled in terrific glory, thou hadst fall'n Most honoured; and Remembrance, while she thought Upon thy gallant end, had dried her tear! Now far beyond the huge Atlantic wave Thy bones decay; the withering pestilence, That swept the islands of the western world, Smote thee, untimely drooping to the tomb! But 'tis enough; whate'er a soldier's fate, That firm he hied him, where stern honour bade; Though with unequal strength, he sunk and died. TRANSATION OF A LATIN POEM BY THE REV. NEWTON OGLE, DEAN OF MANCHESTER. Oh thou, that prattling on thy pebbled way Through my paternal vale dost stray, Working thy shallow passage to the sea! Oh, stream, thou speedest on The same as many seasons gone; But not, alas, to me Remain the feelings that beguiled My early road, when, careless and content, (Losing the hours in pastimes innocent) Upon thy banks I strayed a playful child; Whether the pebbles that thy margin strew, Collecting, heedlessly I threw; Or loved in thy translucent wave My tender shrinking feet to lave; Or else ensnared your little fry, And thought how wondrous skilled was I! So passed my boyish days, unknown to pain, Days that will ne'er return again. It seems but yesterday I was a child, to-morrow to be gray! So years succeeding years steal silently away. Not fleeter thy own current, hurrying thee, Rolls down to the great sea. Thither oh carry these sad thoughts; the deep Bury them!—thou, meantime, thy tenor keep, And winding through the green-wood, cheer, As erst, my native, peaceful pastures here. ST MICHAEL'S MOUNT. INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD SOMERS. While summer airs scarce breathe along the tide, Oft pausing, up the mountain's craggy side We climb, how beautiful, how still, how clear, The scenes that stretch around! The rocks that rear Their shapes, in rich fantastic colours dressed; The hill-tops, where the softest shadows rest; The long-retiring bay, the level sand, The fading sea-line, and the furthest land, That seems, as low it lessens from the eye, To steal away beneath the cloudless sky! But yesterday, the misty morn was spread In dreariness on the bleak mountain's head; No glittering prospect from the upland smiled, The driving squall came dark, the sea heaved wild, And, lost and lonely, the wayfarer sighed, Wet with the hoar spray of the flashing tide. How changed is now the circling scene! The deep Stirs not; the glancing roofs and white towers peep Along the margin of the lucid bay; The sails, descried far in the offing gray, Hang motionless, and the pale headland's height Is touched as with sweet gleams of fairy light! Oh, lives there on earth's busy-stirring scene, Whom Nature's tranquil charms, her airs serene, Her seas, her skies, her sunbeams, fail to move With stealing tenderness and grateful love! Go, thankless man, to Misery's cave—behold Captivity, stretched in her dungeon cold! Or think on those who, in yon dreary mine, Sunk fathoms deep beneath the rolling brine, From year to year, amid the lurid shade, O'er-wearied, ply their melancholy trade; That thou may'st bless the glorious sun; and hail Him who with beauty clothed the hill and vale; Who bent the arch of the high heavens for thee, And stretched in amplitude the broad blue sea! Now sunk are all its murmurs; and the air But moves by fits the bents, that here and there Upshoot in casual spots of faded green: Here straggling sheep the scanty pasture glean, Or, on the jutting fragments that impend, Stray fearlessly, and gaze, as we ascend. Mountain, no pomp of waving woods hast thou, That deck with varied shade thy hoary brow; No sunny meadows at thy feet are spread, No streamlets sparkle o'er their pebbly bed! But thou canst boast thy beauties: ample views That catch the rapt eye of the pausing Muse; Headlands around new-lighted; sails, and seas, Now glassy-smooth, now wrinkling to the breeze; And when the drisly Winter, wrapped in sleet, Goes by, and winds and rain thy ramparts beat, Fancy can see thee standing thus aloof, And frowning, bleak, and bare, and tempest-proof, Look as with awful confidence, and brave The howling hurricane, the dashing wave; More graceful, when the storm's dark vapours frown, Than when the summer suns in pomp go down! And such is he, who, clad in watchet weeds, And boasting little more than nature needs, Can wrap him in contentedness, and wear A port unchanged, in seasons rude or fair. His may be Fancy's sunshine, and the Muse May deck his visions with her fairest hues; And he may lift his honest front, and say To the hard storm, that rends his locks of gray, I heed thee not;—he unappalled may stand Beneath the cloud that shades a sinking land, While heedless of the storm that onward sweeps, Mad, impious Riot his loud wassail keeps, Pre-eminent in native worth; nor bend, Though gathering ills on his bare head descend: And when the wasteful storm sweeps o'er its prey, And rends the kingdoms of the world away, He, firm as stands the rock's unshaken base, Yet panting for a surer resting-place, The human hurricane unmoved can see, And say, O God, my refuge is in Thee! States, anchored deep, that far their shadow cast, Rock, and are scattered by the Almighty's blast; As when, awakened from his horrid sleep, In fiery caves, a thousand fathoms deep, The Earthquake's Demon hies aloft; he waits, Nigh some high-turreted proud city's gates, As listening to the mingled shouts and din Of the mad crowd that feast or dance within. Mean time sad Nature feels his sway, the wave Heaves, and low sounds moan through the mountain cave; Then all at once is still, still as midnight, When not the lime-leaf moves: Oh, piteous sight! For now the glittering domes crash from on high— And hark, a strange and lamentable cry! It ceases, and the tide's departing roar Alone is heard upon the desert shore, That, as it sweeps with slow huge swell away, Remorseless mutters o'er its buried prey. So Ruin hurrieth o'er this shaken ball: He bids his blast go forth, and lo! doth fall A Carthage or a Rome. Then rolls the tide Of deep Forgetfulness, whelming the pride Of man, his shattered and forsaken bowers, His noiseless cities, and his prostrate towers. Some columns, eminent and awful, stand, Like Egypt's pillars on the lonely sand; We read upon their base, inscribed by Fame, A Homer's here, or here a Shakespeare's name; Yet think not of the surge, that soon may sweep Ourselves unnumbered to the oblivious deep. Yet time has been, as mouldering legends say, When all yon western tract, and this bright bay, Where now the sunshine sleeps, and wheeling white The sea-mew circles in fantastic flight, Was peopled wide; but the loud storm hath raved, Where its green top the high wood whispering waved, And many a year the slowly-rising flood Raked, where the Druids' uncooth altar stood. Thou only, aged mountain, dost remain, Stern monument amidst the deluged plain! And fruitless the big waves thy bulwarks beat; The big waves slow retire, and murmur at thy feet: Thou, half-encircled by the refluent tide, As if thy state its utmost rage defied, Dost tower above the scene, as in thine ancient pride. Mountain! the curious Muse might love to gaze On the dim record of thy early days; Oft fancying that she heard, like the low blast, The sounds of mighty generations past. Thee the Phœnician, as remote he sailed Along the unknown coast, exulting hailed, And when he saw thy rocky point aspire, Thought on his native shores of Aradus or Tyre. Distained with many a ghastly giant's blood, Upon thy height huge Corineus stood, And clashed his shield; whilst, hid in caves profound, His monstrous foe cowered at the fearful sound. Hark to the brazen clarion's pealing swell! The shout at intervals, the deepening yell! Long ages speed away, yet now again The noise of battle hurtles on the plain! Behold the dark-haired warriors!—down thy side, O mountain! sternly terrible, they stride! Ev'n now, impatient for the promised war, They rear their axes huge, and shouting, cry to Thor. The sounds of conflict cease—at dead of night A voice is heard: Prepare the Druid rite! And hark! the bard upon thy summit rings The deep chords of his thrilling harp, and sings To Night's pale Queen, that through the heavens wide, Amidst her still host list'ning, seems to ride! Slow sinks the cadence of the solemn lay, And all the sombrous scenery steals away— The shadowy Druid throng, the darksome wood, And the hoar altar, wet with human blood! Marked ye the Angel-spectre that appeared? By other hands the holy fane is reared High on the point, where, gazing o'er the flood, Confessed, the glittering apparition stood. And now the sailor, on his watch of night, Sees, like a glimmering star, the far-off light; Or, homeward bound, hears on the twilight bay The slowly-chanted vespers die away! These scenes are fled and passed, yet still sublime, And wearing graceful the gray tints of Time, Upon the steep rock's craggy eminence The embattled castle sits, surveying thence The villages that strew the subject plain, And the long winding of the lucid main: Meantime the stranger marks its turrets high, And muses on the tale of changeful years gone by. Of this no more: lo! here our journey ends; Wide and more wide the arch of heaven extends, And on this topmost fragment as we lean, We feel removed from dim earth's distant scene. Lift up the hollow trump that on the ground Is cast, and let it, rolling its long sound, Speak to the surge below, that we may gain Tidings from those who traverse the wide main. Or tread we now some spot of wizard-land, And mark the sable trump, that may command The brazen doors to fly, and with loud call Scare the grim giant in his murky hall! Hail, solitary castle! that dost crown This desert summit, and supreme look down On the long-lessening landscape stretched below; Fearless to trace thy inmost haunts we go! We climb the steps:—No warning signs are sent, No fiery shapes flash on the battlement. We enter; the long chambers without fear We traverse; no strange echoes meet the ear; No time-worn tapestry spontaneous shakes, No spell-bound maiden from her trance awakes, But Taste's fair hand arrays the peaceful dome, And hither the domestic virtues come; Pleased, while to this secluded scene they bear Sweets that oft wither in a world of care. Castle! no more thou frownest on the main In the dark terror of thy ancient reign; No more thy long and dreary halls affright, Swept by the stoled spirits of the night; But calm, and heedless of the storms that beat, Here Elegance and Peace assume their seat; And when the night descends, and Ocean roars, Rocking without upon his darkened shores, These vaulted roofs to gentle sounds reply, The voice of social cheer, or song of harmony. So fade the modes of life with slow decay, And various ages various hues display! Fled are the grimly shadows of Romance— And, pleased, we see in beauteous troop advance New arts, new manners, from the Gothic gloom Escaped, and scattering flowers that sweetlier bloom! Refinement wakes; before her beaming eye Dispersed, the fumes of feudal darkness fly. Like orient Morning on the mountain's head, A softer light on life's wide scene is shed; Lapping in bliss the sense of human cares, Hark! Melody pours forth her sweetest airs; And like the shades that on the still lake lie, Of rocks, or fringing woods, or tinted sky, Painting her hues on the clear tablet lays, And her own beauteous world with tender touch displays! Then Science lifts her form, august and fair, And shakes the night-dews from her glittering hair; Meantime rich Culture clothes the living waste, And purer patterns of Athenian Taste Invite the eye, and wake the kindling sense; And milder Manners, as they play, dispense, Like tepid airs of Spring, their genial influence! Such is thy boast, Refinement. But deep dyes Oft mar the splendour of thy noontide skies: Then Fancy, sick of follies that deform The face of day, and in the sunshine swarm; Sick of the fluttering fopperies that engage The vain pursuits of a degenerate age; Sick of smooth Sophistry's insidious cant, Or cold Impiety's defying rant; Sick of the muling sentiment that sighs O'er its dead bird, while Want unpitied cries; Sick of the pictures that pale Lust inflame, And flush the cheek of Love with deep, deep shame; Would fain the shade of elder days recall, The Gothic battlements, the bannered hall; Or list of elfin harps the fabling rhyme, Or wrapped in melancholy trance sublime, Pause o'er the working of some wond'rous tale, Or bid the spectres of the castle hail! Oh, might I now, amid the frowning storm, Behold, great Vision of the Mount! thy form, Such and so vast as thou wert seen of yore, When looking steadfast to Bayonna's shore, Thou sattest awful on the topmost stone, Making the rock thy solitary throne! For up the narrow steps, winding with pain, The watch-tower's loftiest platform now we gain. Departed spirit! fruitless is the prayer, We see alone thy long-deserted chair; And never more, or in the storm of night, Or by the glimmering moon's illusive light, Or when the flash, with red and hasty glance, Sudden illumes the sea's remote expanse, The shores, the cliffs, the mountain, till again Deep darkness closes on the roaring main, Shalt thou, dread Angel, with unaltered mien, Sublime upon thy cloudy seat be seen! Yet, musing much on wild tradition's lore, And many a phantom tale, believed of yore, Chiefly remembering the sweet song (whose strain Shall never die) of him who wept in vain For his loved Lycidas, in the wide sea Whelmed, when he cried, great Angel, unto thee, The fabled scene of thy renown we trace, And hail, with thronging thoughts, thy hallowed resting-place! The stealing Morn goes out—here let us end Fitliest our song, and to the shore descend. Yet once more, azure ocean, and once more, Ye lighted headlands, and thou stretching shore, Down on the beauties of your scenes we cast A tender look, the longest and the last! Amid the arch of heaven, extended clear, Scarce the thin flecks of feathery clouds appear; Beyond the long curve of the lessening bay The still Atlantic stretches its bright way; The tall ship moves not on the tranquil brine; Around, the solemn promontories shine; No sounds approach us, save, at times, the cry Of the gray gull, that scarce is heard so high; The billows make no noise, and on the breast Of charmed Ocean, Silence sinks to rest! Oh, might we thus from heaven's bright battlements Behold the scene Humanity presents; And see, like this, all harmonised and still, And hear no far-off sounds of earthly ill! Wide landscape of the world, in purest light Arrayed, how fair, how cheering were the sight! Alas! we think upon this seat of care, And ask, if peace, if harmony be there. We hear the clangours and the cries that shake The mad world, and their dismal music make; We see gaunt Vice, of dread, enormous size, That fearless in the broad day sweltering lies, And scorns the feeble arrow that assails His Heaven-defying crest and iron scales; His brows with wan and withered roses crowned, And reeling to the pipe's lascivious sound, We see Intemperance his goblet quaff; And mocking Blasphemy, with mad loud laugh, Acting before high Heaven a direr part, Sport with the weapons that shall pierce his heart! If o'er the southern wave we turn our sight, More dismal shapes of hideous woe affright: Grim-visaged War, that ruthless, as he hies, Drowns with his trumpet's blast a brother's cries; And Massacre, by yelling furies led, With ghastly grin and eye-balls rolling red! O'er a vast field, wide heaped with festering slain, Hark! how the Demon Passions shout amain, And cry, exulting, while the death-storm lowers, Hurrah! the kingdoms of the world are ours! O God! who madest man, I see these things, And wearied wish for a fleet angel's wings, That I might fly away, and hear no more The surge that moans along this mortal shore! But Joy's unclouded sunshine may not be, Till, Father of all worlds, we rest with Thee! Then Truth, uplifting from thy works the pall, Shall speak: In wisdom hast Thou made them all; Then angels and archangels, as they gaze, And all the acclaiming host of heaven, shall raise The loud hosannah of eternal praise! Here all is mixed with sorrow; and the clouds Hang awfully, whose shade the dim earth shrouds; Therefore I mourn for man, and sighing say, As down the steep I wind my homeward way, Oh, when will Earth's long muttering tempests cease, And all be sunshine (like this scene) and peace! ON AN UNFORTUNATE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. WRITTEN DECEMBER 1783. Oh, Mary, when distress and anguish came, And slow disease preyed on thy wasted frame; When every friend, ev'n like thy bloom, was fled, And Want bowed low thy unsupported head; Sure sad Humanity a tear might give, And Virtue say, Live, beauteous sufferer, live! But should there one be found, (amidst the few Who with compassion thy last pangs might view), One who beheld thy errors with a tear, To whom the ruins of thy heart were dear, Who fondly hoped, the ruthful season past, Thy faded virtues might revive at last; Should such be found—oh! when he saw thee lie, Closing on every earthly hope thine eye; When he beheld despair, with rueful trace, Mark the strange features of thy altered face; When he beheld, as painful death drew nigh, Thy pale, pale cheek, thy feebly lifted eye, Thy chill, shrunk hand, hung down as in despair, Or slowly raised, with many a muttered prayer;— When thus, in early youth, he saw thee bend Poor to the grave, and die without a friend; Some sadder feelings might unbidden start, And more than common pity touch his heart! The eventful scene is closed; with pausing dread And sorrow I drew nigh the silent bed; Thy look was calm—thy heart was cold and still, As if the world had never used it ill; Methought the last faint smile, with traces weak, Still seemed to linger on thy faded cheek. Poor Mary! though most beauteous in thy face, Ere sorrow touched it, beamed each lovely grace; Yet, oh! thy living features never wore A look so sweet, so eloquent before, As this, which bids all human passions cease, And tells my pitying heart you died in peace! HYMN TO WODEN. God of the battle, hear our prayer! By the lifted falchion's glare; By the uncouth fane sublime, Marked with many a Runic rhyme; By the “weird sisters” dread, That, posting through the battle red, Choose the slain, and with them go To Valhalla's halls below, Where the phantom-chiefs prolong Their echoing feast, a giant throng, And their dreadful beverage drain From the skulls of warriors slain: God of the battle, hear our prayer; And may we thy banquet share! Save us, god, from slow disease; From pains that the brave spirit freeze; From the burning fever's rage; From wailings of unhonoured age, Drawing painful his last breath; Give us in the battle death! Let us lift our glittering shield, And perish, perish in the field! Now o'er Cumri's hills of snow To death, or victory, we go; Hark! the chiefs their cars prepare; See! they bind their yellow hair; Frenzy flashes from their eye, They fly—our foes before them fly! Woden, in thy empire drear, Thou the groans of death dost hear, And welcome to thy dusky hall Those that for their country fall! Hail, all hail the godlike train, That with thee the goblet drain; Or with many a huge compeer, Lift, as erst, the shadowy spear! Whilst Hela's inmost caverns dread Echo to their giant tread, And ten thousand thousand shields Flash lightning o'er the glimmering fields! Hark! the battle-shouts begin— Louder sounds the glorious din: Louder than the ice's roar, Bursting on the thawing shore; Or crashing pines that strew the plain, When the whirlwinds hurl the main! Riding through the death-field red, And singling fast the destined dead, See the fatal sisters fly! Now my throbbing breast beats high— Now I urge my panting steed, Where the foemen thickest bleed. Soon exulting I shall go, Woden, to thy halls below; Or o'er the victims, as they die, Chaunt the song of Victory! COOMBE-ELLEN. Call the strange spirit that abides unseen In wilds, and wastes, and shaggy solitudes, And bid his dim hand lead thee through these scenes That burst immense around! By mountains, glens, And solitary cataracts that dash Through dark ravines; and trees, whose wreathed roots O'erhang the torrent's channelled course; and streams, That far below, along the narrow vale, Upon their rocky way wind musical. Stranger! if Nature charm thee, if thou lovest To trace her awful steps, in glade or glen, Or under covert of the rocking wood, That sways its murmuring and mossy boughs Above thy head; now, when the wind at times Stirs its deep silence round thee, and the shower Falls on the sighing foliage, hail her here In these her haunts; and, rapt in musings high, Think that thou holdest converse with some Power Invisible and strange; such as of yore Greece, in the shades of piney Mænalaus, The abode of Pan, or Ida's hoary caves, Worshipped; and our old Druids, 'mid the gloom Of rocks and woods like these, with muttered spell Invoked, and the loud ring of choral harps. Hast thou oft mourned the chidings of the world, The sound of her disquiet, that ascends For ever, mocking the high throne of God! Hast thou in youth known sorrow! Hast thou drooped, Heart-stricken, over youth's and beauty's grave, And ever after thought on the sad sound The cold earth made, which, cast into the vault, Consigned thy heart's best treasure—dust to dust! Here, lapped into a sweet forgetfulness, Hang o'er the wreathed waterfall, and think Thou art alone in this dark world and wide! Here Melancholy, on the pale crags laid, Might muse herself to sleep; or Fancy come, Witching the mind with tender cozenage, And shaping things that are not; here all day Might Meditation listen to the lapse Of the white waters, flashing through the cleft, And, gazing on the many shadowing trees, Mingle a pensive moral as she gazed. High o'er thy head, amidst the shivered slate, Behold, a sapling yet, the wild ash bend, Its dark red berries clustering, as it wished In the clear liquid mirror, ere it fell, To trace its beauties; o'er the prone cascade, Airy, and light, and elegant, the birch Displays its glossy stem, amidst the gloom Of alders and jagged fern, and evermore Waves her light pensile foliage, as she wooed The passing gale to whisper flatteries. Upon the adverse bank, withered, and stripped Of all its pleasant leaves, a scathed oak Hangs desolate, once sovereign of the scene, Perhaps, proud of its beauty and its strength, And branching its broad arms along the glen: Oh, speaks it no remonstrance to the heart! It seems to say: So shall the spoiler come, The season that shall shatter your fair leaves, Gay children of the summer! yet enjoy Your pleasant prime, and lift your green heads high, Exulting; but the storm will come at last, That shall lay low your strength, and give your pride To the swift-hurrying stream of age, like mine. And so severe Experience oft reproves The gay and careless children of the world; They hear the cold rebuke, and then again Turn to their sport, as likes them, and dance on! And let them dance; so all their blooming prime They give not up to vanity, but learn That wisdom and that virtue which shall best Avail them, when the evil days draw nigh, And the brief blossoms of their spring-time fade. Now wind we up the glen, and hear below The dashing torrent, in deep woods concealed, And now again white-flashing on the view, O'er the huge craggy fragments. Ancient stream, That murmurest through the mountain solitudes, The time has been when no eye marked thy course, Save His who made the world! Fancy might dream She saw thee thus bound on from age to age Unseen of man, whilst awful Nature sat On the rent rocks, and said: These haunts be mine. Now Taste has marked thy features; here and there Touching with tender hand, but injuring not, Thy beauties; whilst along thy woody verge Ascends the winding pathway, and the eye Catches at intervals thy varied falls. But loftier scenes invite us; pass the hill, And through the woody hanging, at whose feet The tinkling Ellen winds, pursue thy way. Yon bleak and weather-whitened rock, immense, Upshoots amidst the scene, craggy and steep, And like some high-embattled citadel, That awes the low plain shadowing. Half-way up The purple heath is seen, but bare its brow, And deep-intrenched, and all beneath it spread With massy fragments riven from its top. Amidst the crags, and scarce discerned so high, Hangs here and there a sheep, by its faint bleat Discovered, whilst the astonished eye looks up, And marks it on the precipice's brink Pick its scant food secure:—and fares it not Ev'n so with you, poor orphans, ye who climb The rugged path of life without a friend; And over broken crags bear hardly on, With pale imploring looks, that seem to say, My mother! she is buried, and at rest, Laid in her grave-clothes; and the heart is still, The only heart that throughout all the world Beat anxiously for you! Oh, yet bear on; He who sustains the bleating lamb shall feed And comfort you: meantime the heaven's pure beam, That breaks above the sable mountain's brow, Lighting, one after one, the sunless crags, Awakes the blissful confidence, that here, Or in a world where sorrow never comes, All shall be well. Now through the whispering wood We steal, and mark the old and mossy oaks Imboss the mountain slope; or the wild ash, With rich red clusters mantling; or the birch, In lonely glens light-wavering; till behold! The rapid river shooting through the gloom Its lucid line along; and on its side The bordering pastures green, where the swinked ox Lies dreaming, heedless of the numerous flies That, in the transitory sunshine, hum Round his broad breast; and further up the cot, With blue, light smoke ascending; images Of peace and comfort! The wild rocks around Endear your smile the more, and the full mind, Sliding from scenes of dread magnificence, Sinks on your charms reposing; such repose The sage may feel, when, filled and half-oppressed With vast conceptions, smiling he returns To life's consoling sympathies, and hears, With heartfelt tenderness, the bells ring out; Or pipe upon the mountains; or the low Of herds slow winding down the cottaged vale, Where day's last sunshine linger. Such repose He feels, who, following where his Shakespeare leads, As in a dream, through an enchanted land, Here, with Macbeth, in the dread cavern hails The weird sisters, and the dismal deed Without a name; there sees the charmed isle, The lone domain of Prospero; and, hark! Wild music, such as earth scarce seems to own, And Ariel o'er the slow-subsiding surge Singing her smooth air quaintly! Such repose Steals o'er her spirits, when, through storms at sea, Fancy has followed some nigh-foundered bark Full many a league, in ocean's solitude Tossed far beyond the Cape of utmost Horn, That stems the roaring deep; her dreary track Still Fancy follows, and at dead of night Hears, with strange thunder, the huge fragments fall Crashing, from mountains of high-drifting ice That o'er her bows gleam fearful; till at last She hails the gallant ship in some still bay Safe moored; or of delightful Tinian, Smiling, like fairy isle, amid the waste; Or of New Zealand, where from sheltering rocks The clear cascades gush beautiful, and high The woodland scenery towers above the mast, Whose long and wavy ensign streams beneath. Far inland, clad in snow, the mountains lift Their spiry summits, and endear the more The sylvan scene around; the healing air Breathes o'er green myrtles, and the poe-bird flits, Amid the shade of aromatic shrubs, With silver neck and blue enamelled wing. Now cross the stream, and up the narrow track, That winds along the mountain's edge, behold The peasant girl ascend: cheerful her look, Beneath the umbrage of her broad black hat, And loose her dark-brown hair; the plodding pad That bears her panting climbs, and with sure step Avoids the jutting fragments; she, meantime, Sits unconcerned, till, lessening from the view, She gains the summit and is seen no more. All day, along that mountain's heathy waste, Booted and strapped, and in rough coat succinct, His small shrill whistle pendent at his breast, With dogs and gun, untired the sportsman roams; Nor quits his wildly-devious range, till eve, Upon the woods, the rocks, and mazy rills Descending, warns him home: then he rejoins The social circle, just as the clear moon, Emerging o'er the sable mountain, sails Silent, and calm, and beautiful, and sheds Its solemn grandeur on the shadowy scene. To music then; and let some chosen strain Of Handel gently recreate the sense, And give the silent heart to tender joy. Pass on to the hoar cataract, that foams Through the dark fissures of the riven rock; Prone-rushing it descends, and with white whirl, Save where some silent shady pool receives Its dash; thence bursting, with collected sweep, And hollow sound, it hurries, till it falls Foaming in the wild stream that winds below. Dark trees, that to the mountain's height ascend, O'ershade with pendent boughs its mossy course, And, looking up, the eye beholds it flash Beneath the incumbent gloom, from ledge to ledge Shooting its silvery foam, and far within Wreathing its curve fantastic. If the harp Of deep poetic inspiration, struck At times by the pale minstrel, whilst a strange And beauteous light filled his uplifted eye, Hath ever sounded into mortal ears, Here I might think I heard its tones, and saw, Sublime amidst the solitary scene, With dimly-gleaming harp, and snowy stole, And cheek in momentary frenzy flushed, The great musician stand. Hush, every wind That shakes the murmuring branches! and thou stream, Descending still with hollow-sounding sweep, Hush! 'Twas the bard struck the loud strings: Arise, Son of the magic song, arise! And bid the deep-toned lyre Pour forth its manly melodies. With eyes on fire, Caradoc rushed upon the foe; He reared his arm—he laid the mighty low! O'er the plain see him urge his gore-bathed steed! They bleed, the Romans bleed! He lifts his lance on high, They fly! the fierce invaders fly! Fear not now the horse or spear, Fear not now the foeman's might; Victory the cry shall hear Of those who for their country fight; O'er the slain That strew the plain, Stern on her sable war-horse shall she ride, And lift her red right hand, in their heart's blood deep dyed! Return, my Muse! the fearful sound is past; And now a little onward, where the way Ascends above the oaks that far below Shade the rude steep, let Contemplation lead Our footsteps; from this shady eminence 'Tis pleasant and yet fearful to look down Upon the river roaring, and far off To see it stretch in peace, and mark the rocks One after one, in solemn majesty Unfolding their wild reaches; here with wood Mantled, beyond abrupt and bare, and each As if it strove, with emulous disdain, To tower in ruder, darker amplitude. Pause, ere we enter the long craggy vale; It seems the abode of Solitude. So high The rock's bleak summit frowns above our head, Looking immediate down, we almost fear Lest some enormous fragment should descend With hideous sweep into the vale, and crush The intruding visitant. No sound is here, Save of the stream that shrills, and now and then A cry as of faint wailing, when the kite Comes sailing o'er the crags, or straggling lamb Bleats for its mother. Here, remote from man, And life's discordant roar, might Piety Lift up her early orisons to Him Who made the world; who piled up, mighty rocks, Your huge o'ershadowing summits; who devolved The mighty rivers on their mazy course; Who bade the seasons roll, and they rolled on In harmony; who filled the earth with joy, And spread it in magnificence. O God! Thou also madest the great water-flood, The deep that uttereth thy voice; whose waves Toss fearful at thy bidding. Thou didst speak, And lo! the great and glorious sun, from night Tenfold upspringing, through the heavens' wide way Held his untired career. These, in their course, As with one shout of acclamation, praise Thee, Lord! thee, Father! thee, Almighty King! Maker of earth and heaven! Nor less the flower That shakes its purple head, and smiles unseen Upon the mountain's van; nor less the stream That tinkles through the cliff-encircled bourne, Cheering with music the lone place, proclaim: In wisdom, Father, hast thou made them all! Scenes of retired sublimity, that fill With fearful ecstasy and holy trance The pausing mind! we leave your awful gloom, And lo! the footway plank, that leads across The narrow torrent, foaming through the chasm Below; the rugged stones are washed and worn Into a thousand shapes, and hollows scooped By long attrition of the ceaseless surge, Smooth, deep, and polished as the marble urn, In their hard forms. Here let us sit, and watch The struggling current burst its headlong way, Hearing the noise it makes, and musing much On the strange changes of this nether world. How many ages must have swept to dust The still succeeding multitudes, that “fret Their little hour” upon this restless scene, Or ere the sweeping waters could have cut The solid rock so deep! As now its roar Comes hollow from below, methinks we hear The noise of generations, as they pass, O'er the frail arch of earthly vanity, To silence and oblivion. The loud coil Ne'er ceases; as the running river sounds From age to age, though each particular wave That made its brief noise, as it hurried on, Ev'n whilst we speak, is past, and heard no more; So ever to the ear of Heaven ascends The long, loud murmur of the rolling globe; Its strife, its toils, its sighs, its shouts, the same! But lo! upon the hilly croft, and scarce Distinguished from the crags, the peasant hut Forth peeping; nor unwelcome is the sight. It seems to say: Though solitude be sweet, And sweet are all the images that float Like summer-clouds before the eye, and charm The pensive wanderer's way, 'tis sweeter yet To think that in this world a brother lives. And lovelier smiles the scene, that, 'mid the wilds Of rocks and mountains, the bemused thought Remembers of humanity, and calls The wildly-roving fancy back to life. Here, then, I leave my harp, which I have touched With careless hand, and here I bid farewell To Fancy's fading pictures, and farewell The ideal spirit that abides unseen 'Mid rocks, and woods, and solitudes. I hail Rather the steps of Culture, that ascend The precipice's side. She bids the wild Bloom, and adorns with beauty not its own The ridged mountain's tract; she speaks, and lo! The yellow harvest nods upon the slope; And through the dark and matted moss upshoots The bursting clover, smiling to the sun. These are thy offspring, Culture! the green herb Is thine, that decks with rich luxuriance The pasture's lawny range; the yellow corn, That waves upon the upland ridge, is thine; Thine too the elegant abode, that smiles Amidst the rocky scene, and wakes the thought, The tender thought, of all life's charities. And senseless were my heart, could I look back Upon the varied way my feet have trod, Without a silent prayer that health and joy, And love and happiness, may long abide In the romantic vale where Ellen winds. SUMMER EVENING AT HOME. Come, lovely Evening! with thy smile of peace Visit my humble dwelling; welcomed in, Not with loud shouts, and the thronged city's din, But with such sounds as bid all tumult cease Of the sick heart; the grasshopper's faint pipe Beneath the blades of dewy grass unripe, The bleat of the lone lamb, the carol rude Heard indistinctly from the village green, The bird's last twitter, from the hedge-row seen, Where, just before, the scattered crumbs I strewed, To pay him for his farewell song;—all these Touch soothingly the troubled ear, and please The stilly-stirring fancies. Though my hours (For I have drooped beneath life's early showers) Pass lonely oft, and oft my heart is sad, Yet I can leave the world, and feel most glad To meet thee, Evening, here; here my own hand Has decked with trees and shrubs the slopes around, And whilst the leaves by dying airs are fanned, Sweet to my spirit comes the farewell sound, That seems to say: Forget the transient tear Thy pale youth shed—Repose and Peace are here. WINTER EVENING AT HOME. Fair Moon, that at the chilly day's decline Of sharp December through my cottage pane Dost lovely look, smiling, though in thy wane! In thought, to scenes, serene and still as thine, Wanders my heart, whilst I by turns survey Thee slowly wheeling on thy evening way; And this my fire, whose dim, unequal light, Just glimmering, bids each shadowy image fall Sombrous and strange upon the darkening wall, Ere the clear tapers chase the deepening night! Yet thy still orb, seen through the freezing haze, Shines calm and clear without; and whilst I gaze, I think, around me in this twilight room, I but remark mortality's sad gloom; Whilst hope and joy cloudless and soft appear, In the sweet beam that lights thy distant sphere. THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION. Stern Father of the storm! who dost abide Amid the solitude of the vast deep, For ever listening to the sullen tide, And whirlwinds that the billowy desert sweep! Thou at the distant death-shriek dost rejoice; The rule of the tempestuous main is thine, Outstretched and lone; thou utterest thy voice, Like solemn thunders: These wild waves are mine; Mine their dread empire; nor shall man profane The eternal secrets of my ancient reign. The voice is vain: secure, and as in scorn, The gallant vessel scuds before the wind; Her parting sails swell stately to the morn; She leaves the green earth and its hills behind; Gallant before the wind she goes, her prow High bearing, and disparting the blue tide That foams and flashes in its rage below; Meantime the helmsman feels a conscious pride, And while far onward the long billows swell, Looks to the lessening land, that seems to say, Farewell! Father of storms! then let thy whirlwinds roar O'er seas of solitary amplitude; Man, the poor tenant of thy rocky shore, Man, thy terrific empire hath subdued; And though thy waves toss his high-foundered bark Where no dim watch-light gleams, still he defies Thy utmost rage, and in his buoyant ark Speeds on, regardless of the darkening skies; And o'er the mountain-surges, as they roll, Subdues his destined way, and speeds from pole to pole. Behold him now, far from his native plain, Where high woods shade some wild Hesperian bay, Or green isles glitter in the southern main, His streaming ensign to the morn display! Behold him, where the North's pale meteors dance, And icy rocks roll glimmering from afar, Fearless through night and solitude advance! Or where the pining sons of Andamar, When dark eclipse has wrapt the labouring moon, Howl to the demon of the dread monsoon! Time was, like them, poor Nature's shivering child, Pacing the beach, and by the salt spray beat, He watched the melancholy surge, or smiled To see it burn and bicker at his feet; In some rude shaggy spot, by fortune placed, He dreamed not of strange lands, and empires spread, Beyond the rolling of the watery waste; He saw the sun shine on the mountain's head, But knew not, whilst he hailed the orient light, What myriads blessed his beam, or sickened at the sight. From some dark promontory, that o'erbent The flashing waves, he heard their ceaseless roar; Or carolled in his light canoe content, As, bound from creek to creek, it grazed the shore; Gods of the storm the dreary space might sweep, And shapes of death, and gliding spectres gaunt, Might flit, he thought, o'er the remoter deep; And whilst strange voices cried, Avaunt, avaunt! Uncertain lights, seen through the midnight gloom, Might lure him sadly on to his cold watery tomb. No city, then, amid the calm clear day, O'er the blue waters' undulating line, With battlements, and fans that glittered gay, And piers, and thronging masts, was seen to shine. No cheerful sounds were wafted on the gale, Nor hummed the shores with early industry; But mournful birds in hollow cliffs did wail, And there all day the cormorant did cry, While with sunk eye, and matted, dripping locks, The houseless savage slept beneath the foam-beat rocks. Thus slumbering long upon the dreamy verge Of instinct, see, he rouses from his trance! Faint, and as glimmering yet, the Arts emerge, One after one, from darkness, and advance, Beauteous, as o'er the heavens the stars' still way. Now see the track of his dominion wide, Fair smiling as the dayspring; cities gay Lift their proud heads, and o'er the yellow tide, Whilst sounds of fervent industry arise, A thousand pennants float bright streaming in the skies! Genius of injured Asia! once sublime And glorious, now dim seen amid the storm, And melancholy clouds of sweeping time, Who yet dost half reveal thine awful form, Pointing, with saddened aspect and slow hand, To vast emporiums, desolate and waste; To wrecks of unknown cities, sunk in sand! 'Twas at thy voice, Arts, Order, Science, Taste, Upsprung, the East adorning, like the smile Of Spring upon the banks of thy own swelling Nile. 'Twas at thy voice huge Enterprise awoke, That, long on rocky Aradus reclined, Slumbered to the hoarse surge that round her broke, And hollow pipings of the idle wind; She heard thy voice, upon the rock she stood Gigantic, the rude scene she marked—she cried, Let there be intercourse, and the great flood Waft the rich plenty to these shores denied! And soon thine eye delighted saw aspire, Crowning the midland main, thy own Imperial Tyre. Queen of the waters! who didst ope the gate Of Commerce, and display in lands unknown Thy venturous sail, ev'n now in ancient state Methinks I see thee on thy rocky throne; I see their massy piles thy cothons rear, And on the deep a solemn shadow cast; I traverse thy once echoing shores, and hear The sound of mighty generations past: I see thy kingly merchants' thronged resort, And gold and purple gleam o'er all thy spacious port. I mark thy glittering galleys sweep along— The steady rowers to the strokes incline, And chaunt in unison their choral song; White through their oars the ivory benches shine; The fine-wrought sails, which looms of Egypt wove, Swell beautiful beneath the bending mast; Hewn from proud Lebanon's immortal grove, The oaks of Bashan brave the roaring blast! So o'er the western wave thy vessels float, For verdant Egypt bound, or Calpe's cliffs remote. Queen of the waters! throned upon thy seat Amid the sea, thy beauty and thy fame The deep, that rolls low-murmuring at thy feet, And all the multitude of isles, proclaim! For thee Damascus piles her woolly store; To thee their flocks Arabia's princes bring; And Sheba heaps her spice and glittering ore; The ships of Tarshish of thy glory sing: Queen of the waters! who is like to thee, Replenished in thy might, and throned on the sea! The purple streamers fly, the trumpets sound, The adventurous bark glides on in tranquil state; The voyagers, with leafy garlands crowned, Draw back their arms together, and elate Sweep o'er the surge; the spray far scattered flies Beneath the stroke of their unwearied oars; To their loud shouts the circling coast replies; And now, o'er the deep ocean, where it roars They fly; till slowly lessening from the shore, Beneath the haze they sink—sink, and are seen no more. When Night descends, and with her silver bow The Queen of Heaven comes forth in radiance bright, Surveying the dim earth and seas below; Why from afar resounds the mystic rite Hymned round her uncouth altar? Virgins there (Amid the brazen cymbal's hollow ring) And aged priests the solemn feast prepare; To her their nightly orisons they sing; That she may look from her high throne, and guide The wandering bark secure along the trackless tide. Her on his nightly watch the pilot views Careful, and by her soft and tranquil light, Along the uncertain coast his track pursues; And now he sees great Carmel's woody height, Where nightly fires to grisly Baal burn; Round the rough cape he winds; meantime far on Thick eddying scuds the hollow surf upturn; He thinks of the sweet light of summer gone! He thinks, perhaps, dashed on the rugged shore, He never shall behold his babes' loved mother more! Slow comes the morn; but ah! what demon form, While pealing thunder the high concave rends, Rises more vast amid the rushing storm! With dreadful shade his horrid bulk ascends Dark to the driving clouds; beneath him roars The deep; his troubled brow is wrapped in gloom; See, it moves onwards; now more huge it soars! Who shall avert the poor seafarer's doom! Who now shall save him from the spectre's might That treads the rocking waves in thunder and in night! Dread phantom! art thou he whose fearful sway, As Egypt's hoary chronicles have told, The clouds, the whirlwinds, and the seas obey, Typhon, of aspect hideous to behold! Oh, spare the wretched wanderers, who, led By flattering hopes, have left the peaceful shore! Behold, they shrink, they bend with speechless dread; From their faint grasp drops the unheeded oar! It answers not, but mingling seas and sky, In clouds, and wind, and thunder, rushes by. Hail to thy light, lord of the golden day, That, bursting through the sable clouds again, Dost cheer the seaman's solitary way, And with new splendour deck the lucid main! And lo! the voyage past, where many a palm, Its green top only seen, the prospect bounds, Fringing the sunny sea-line, clear and calm; Now hark the slowly-swelling human sounds! Meantime the bark along the placid bay Of Tamiatis keeps her easy-winding way. Here rest we safe from scenes of peril past, No danger lurks in this serene retreat; No more is heard the roaring of the blast, But pastoral sounds of scattered flocks that bleat, Or evening herds that o'er the champaign low; Here citrons tall and purple dates around Delicious fragrance and cool shade bestow; The shores with murmuring industry resound; While through the vernal pastures where he strays, The Nile, as with delight, his mazy course delays. WATER-PARTY ON BEAULIEU RIVER, IN THE NEW FOREST. I thought 'twas a toy of the fancy, a dream That leads with illusion the senses astray, And I sighed with delight as we stole down the stream, While the sun, as he smiled on our sail, seemed to say, Rejoice in my light, ere it fade fast away! We left the loud rocking of ocean behind, And stealing along the clear current serene, The Phædria spread her white sails to the wind, And they who divided had many a day been, Gazed with added delight on the charms of the scene. Each bosom one spirit of peace seemed to feel; We heard not the tossing, the stir, and the roar Of the ocean without; we heard only the keel, The keel that went whispering along the green shore, And the stroke, as it dipped, of the feathering oar. Beneath the dark woods now, as winding we go, What sounds of rich harmony burst on the ear! Hark, cheer'ly the loud-swelling clarionets blow; Now the tones gently die, now more mellow we hear The horns through the high forest echoing clear! They cease; and no longer the echoes prolong The swell of the concert; in silence we float— In silence! Oh, listen! 'tis woman's sweet song— The bends of the river reply to each note, And the oar is held dripping and still from the boat. Mark the sun that descends o'er the curve of the flood! Seize, Wilmot, the pencil, and instant convey To the tablet the water, the banks, and the wood, That their colours may live without change or decay, When these beautiful tints die in darkness away. So when we are parted, and tossed on the deep, And no longer the light on our prospect shall gleam, The semblance of one lovely scene we may keep, And remember the day, and the hour, like a dream, When we sighed with delight as we stole down the stream! MONODY ON THE DEATH OF DR WARTON. Oh! I should ill thy generous cares requite Thou who didst first inspire my timid Muse, Could I one tuneful tear to thee refuse, Now that thine aged eyes are closed in night, Kind Warton! Thou hast stroked my stripling head, And sometimes, mingling soft reproof with praise, My path hast best directed through the maze Of thorny life: by thee my steps were led To that romantic valley, high o'erhung With sable woods, where many a minstrel rung His bold harp to the sweeping waterfall; Whilst Fancy loved around each form to call That fill the poet's dream: to this retreat Of Fancy, (won by whose enticing lay I have forgot how sunk the summer's day), Thou first did guide my not unwilling feet; Meantime inspiring the gay breast of youth With love of taste, of science, and of truth. The first inciting sounds of human praise, A parent's love excepted, came from thee; And but for thee, perhaps, my boyish days Had all passed idly, and whate'er in me Now live of hope, been buried. I was one, Long bound by cold dejection's numbing chain, As in a torpid trance, that deemed it vain To struggle; nor my eyelids to the sun Uplifted: but I heard thy cheering voice; I shook my deadly slumber off; I gazed Delighted 'round; awaked, inspired, amazed, I marked another world, and in my choice Lovelier, and decked with light! On fairy ground Methought I buoyant trod, and heard the sound As of enchanting melodies, that stole, Stole gently, and entranced my captive soul. Then all was life and hope! 'Twas thy first ray, Sweet Fancy, on the heart; as when the day Of Spring, along the melancholy tract Of wintry Lapland, dawns; the cataract, From ice dissolving on the silent side Of some white precipice, with paly gleam Descends, while the cold hills a slanting beam Faint tinges: till, ascending in his pride, The great Sun from the red horizon looks, And wakes the tuneless birds, the stagnant brooks, And sleeping lakes! So on my mind's cold night The ray of Fancy shone, and gave delight And hope past utterance. Thy cheering voice, O Warton! bade my silent heart rejoice, And wake to love of nature; every breeze, On Itchin's brink was melody; the trees Waved in fresh beauty; and the wind and rain, That shook the battlements of Wykeham's fane, Not less delighted, when, with random pace, I trod the cloistered aisles; and witness thou, Catherine, upon whose foss-encircled brow We met the morning, how I loved to trace The prospect spread around; the rills below, That shone irriguous in the gleaming plain; The river's bend, where the dark barge went slow, And the pale light on yonder time-worn fane! So passed my days with new delight; mean time To Learning's tender eye thou didst unfold The classic page, and what high bards of old, With solemn notes, and minstrelsy sublime, Have chanted, we together heard; and thou, Warton! wouldst bid me listen, till a tear Sprang to mine eye: now the bold song we hear Of Greece's sightless master-bard: the breast Beats high; with stern Pelides to the plain We rush; or o'er the corpse of Hector slain Hang pitying;—and lo! where pale, oppressed With age and grief, sad Priam comes; with beard All white he bows, kissing the hands besmeared With his last hope's best blood! The oaten reed Now from the mountain sounds; the sylvan Muse, Reclined by the clear stream of Arethuse, Wakes the Sicilian pipe; the sunny mead Swarms with the bees, whose drowsy lullaby Soothes the reclining ox with half-closed eye; While in soft cadence to the madrigal, From rock to rock the whispering waters fall! But who is he, that, by yon gloomy cave, Bids heaven and earth bear witness to his woe! And hark! how hollowly the ocean-wave Echoes his plaint, and murmurs deep below! Haste, let the tall ship stem the tossing tide, That he may leave his cave, and hear no more The Lemnian surges unrejoicing roar; And be great Fate through the dark world thy guide, Sad Philoctetes! So Instruction bland, With young-eyed Sympathy, went hand in hand O'er classic fields; and let my heart confess Its holier joy, when I essayed to climb The lonely heights where Shakspeare sat sublime, Lord of the mighty spell: around him press Spirits and fairy-forms. He, ruling wide His visionary world, bids terror fill The shivering breast, or softer pity thrill Ev'n to the inmost heart. Within me died All thoughts of this low earth, and higher powers Seemed in my soul to stir; till, strained too long, The senses sunk. Then, Ossian, thy wild song Haply beguiled the unheeded midnight hours, And, like the blast that swept Berrathron's towers, Came pleasant and yet mournful to my soul! See o'er the autumnal heath the gray mists roll! Hark to the dim ghosts' faint and feeble cry, As on the cloudy tempest they pass by! Saw ye huge Loda's spectre-shape advance, Through which the stars look pale! Nor ceased the trance Which bound the erring fancy, till dark night Flew silent by, and at my window-grate The morning bird sang loud: nor less delight The spirit felt, when still and charmed I sate Great Milton's solemn harmonies to hear, That swell from the full chord, and strong and clear, Beyond the tuneless couplets' weak control, Their long-commingling diapason roll, In varied sweetness. Nor, amidst the choir Of pealing minstrelsy, was thy own lyre, Warton, unheard;—as Fancy poured the song, The measured music flowed along, Till all the heart and all the sense Felt her divinest influence, In throbbing sympathy:—Prepare the car, And whirl us, goddess, to the war, Where crimson banners fire the skies, Where the mingled shouts arise, Where the steed, with fetlock red, Tramples the dying and the dead; And amain, from side to side, Death his pale horse is seen to ride! Or rather, sweet enthusiast, lead Our footsteps to the cowslip mead, Where, as the magic spell is wound, Dying music floats around:— Or seek we some gray ruin's shade, And pity the cold beggar, laid Beneath the ivy-rustling tower, At the dreary midnight hour, Scarce sheltered from the drifting snow; While her dark locks the bleak winds blow O'er her sleeping infant's cheek! Then let the shrilling trumpet speak, And pierce in louder tones the ear, Till, while it peals, we seem to hear The sounding march, as of the Theban's song; And varied numbers, in their course, With gathering fulness, and collected force, Like the broad cataract, swell and sweep along! Struck by the sounds, what wonder that I laid, As thou, O Warton! didst the theme inspire, My inexperienced hand upon the lyre, And soon with transient touch faint music made, As soon forgotten! So I loved to lie By the wild streams of elfin poesy, Rapt in strange musings; but when life began, I never roamed a visionary man; For, taught by thee, I learned with sober eyes To look on life's severe realities. I never made (a dream-distempered thing) Poor Fiction's realm my world; but to cold Truth Subdued the vivid shapings of my youth. Save when the drisly woods were murmuring, Or some hard crosses had my spirit bowed; Then I have left, unseen, the careless crowd, And sought the dark sea roaring, or the steep That braved the storm; or in the forest deep, As all its gray leaves rustled, wooed the tone Of the loved lyre, that, in my springtide gone, Waked me to transport. Eighteen summers now Have smiled on Itchin's margin, since the time When these delightful visions of our prime Rose on my view in loveliness. And thou Friend of my muse, in thy death-bed art cold, Who, with the tenderest touches, didst unfold The shrinking leaves of Fancy, else unseen And shelterless: therefore to thee are due Whate'er their summer sweetness; and I strew, Sadly, such flowerets as on hillocks green, Or mountain-slope, or hedge-row, yet my hand May cull, with many a recollection bland, And mingled sorrow, Warton, on thy tomb, To whom, if bloom they boast, they owe their bloom! EPITAPH ON H. WALMSLEY, ESQ., IN ALVERSTOKE CHURCH, HANTS. Oh! they shall ne'er forget thee, they who knew Thy soul benevolent, sincere, and true; The poor thy kindness cheered, thy bounty fed, Whom age left shivering in its dreariest shed; Thy friends, who sorrowing saw thee, when disease Seemed first the genial stream of life to freeze, Pale from thy hospitable home depart, Thy hand still open, and yet warm thy heart! But how shall she her love, her loss express, Thy widow, in this uttermost distress, When she with anguish hears her lisping train Upon their buried father call in vain! She wipes the tear despair had forced to flow, She lifts her look beyond this vale of woe, And rests (while humbled in the dust she kneels) On Him who only knows how much she feels. AGE. Age, thou the loss of health and friends shalt mourn! But thou art passing to that night-still bourne, Where labour sleeps. The linnet, chattering loud To the May morn, shall sing; thou, in thy shroud, Forgetful and forgotten, sink to rest; And grass-green be the sod upon thy breast! ON A LANDSCAPE BY RUBENS. Nay, let us gaze, ev'n till the sense is full, Upon the rich creation, shadowed so That not great Nature, in her loftiest pomp Of living beauty, ever on the sight Rose more magnificent; nor aught so fair Hath Fancy, in her wildest, brightest mood, Imaged of things most lovely, when the sounds Of this cold cloudy world at distance sink, And all alone the warm idea lives Of what is great, or beautiful, or good, In Nature's general plan. So the vast scope, O Rubens! of thy mighty mind, and such The fervour of thy pencil, pouring wide The still illumination, that the mind Pauses, absorbed, and scarcely thinks what powers Of mortal art the sweet enchantment wrought. She sees the painter, with no human touch, Create, embellish, animate at will, The mimic scenes, from Nature's ampler range Caught as by inspiration; while the clouds, High wandering, and the fairest form of things, Seem at his bidding to emerge, and burn With radiance and with life! Let us, subdued, Now to the magic of the moment lose The thoughts of life, and mingle every sense Ev'n in the scenes before us! The fresh morn Of summer shines; the white clouds of the east Are crisped; beneath, the bright blue champaign steams; The banks, the meadows, and the flowers, send up An incensed exhalation, like the meek And holy praise of Him whose soul's deep joy The lone woods witness. Thou, whose heart is sick Of vanities; who, in the throng of men, Dost feel no lenient fellowship; whose eye Turns, with a languid carelessness, around Upon the toiling crowd, still murmuring on, Restless;—oh, think, in summer scenes like these, How sweet the sense of quiet gladness is, That, like the silent breath of morning, steals From lowly nooks, and feels itself expand Amid the works of Nature, to the Power That made them: to the awful thought of Him Who, when the morning stars shouted for joy, Bade the great sun from tenfold darkness burst, The green earth roll in light, and solitude First hear the voice of man, whilst hills and woods Stood eminent, in orient hues arrayed, His dwelling; and all living Nature smiled, As in this pictured semblance, beaming full Before us! Mark again the various view: Some city's far-off spires and domes appear, Breaking the long horizon, where the morn Sits blue and soft: what glowing imagery Is spread beneath!—Towns, villages, light smoke, And scarce-seen windmill-sails, and devious woods, Chequering 'mid sunshine the grass-level land, That stretches from the sight. Now nearer trace The forms of trees distinct—the broad brown oak; The poplars, that, with silvery trunks, incline, Shading the lonely castle; flakes of light Are flung behind the massy groups, that, now Enlarging and enlarging still, unfold Their separate beauties. But awhile delay; Pass the foot-bridge, and listen (for we hear, Or think we hear her), listen to the song Of yonder milkmaid, as she brims her pail; Whilst, in the yellow pasture, pensive near, The red cows ruminate. Break off, break off, for lo! where, all alarmed, The small birds, from the late resounding perch, Fly various, hushed their early song; and mark, Beneath the darkness of the bramble-bank That overhangs the half-seen brook, where nod The flowing rushes, dew-besprent, with breast Ruddy, and emerald wing, the kingfisher Steals through the dripping sedge away. What shape Of terrors scares the woodland habitants, Marring the music of the dawn? Look round; See, where he creeps, beneath the willowy stump, Cowering and low, step silent after step, The booted fowler: keen his look, and fixed Upon the adverse bank, while, with firm hand, He grasps the deadly tube; his dog, with ears Hung back, and still and steady eye of fire, Points to the prey; the boor, intent, moves on Panting, and creeping close beneath the leaves, And fears lest ev'n the rustling reeds betray His footfall; nearer yet, and yet more near, He stalks. Who now shall save the heedless group, The speckled partridges, that in the sun, On yonder hillock green, across the stream, Bask unalarmed beneath the hawthorn bush, Whose aged boughs the crawling blackberry Entwines! And thus, upon the sweetest scenes Of human loveliness, and social peace Domestic, when the full fond heart reclines Upon its hopes, and almost mingles tears Of joy, to think that in this hollow world Such bliss should be its portion; then (alas, The bitter change!), then, with his unheard step, In darkness shrouded, yet approaching fast, Death, from amidst the sunny flowers, lifts up His giant dread anatomy, and smites, Smites the fair prospect once, whilst every bloom Hangs shrivelled, and a sound of mourning fills The lone and blasted valley: but no sound Is here of sorrow or of death, though she, The country Kate, with shining morning cheek (Who, in the tumbril, with her market-gear, Sits seated high), seems to expect the flash Exploding, that shall lay the innocent And feathered tenants of the landscape low. Not so the clown, who, heedless whether life Or death betide, across the plashy ford Drives slow; the beasts plod on, foot following foot, Aged and grave, with half-erected ears, As now his whip above their matted manes Hangs tremulous, while the dark and shallow stream Flashes beneath their fetlock: he, astride On harness saddle, not a sidelong look Deigns at the breathing landscape, or the maid Smiling behind; the cold and lifeless calf Her sole companion: and so mated oft Is some sweet maid, whose thrilling heart was formed For dearer fellowship. But lift the eye, And hail the abode of rural ease. The man Walks forth, from yonder antique hall, that looks The mistress of the scene; its turrets gleam Amid the trees, and cheerful smoke is seen, As if no spectred shape (though most retired The spot) there ever wandered, stoled in white, Along the midnight chambers; but quaint Mab Her tiny revels led, till the rare dawn Peeped out, and chanticleer his shrill alarm Beneath the window rang, then, with a wink, The shadowy rout have vanished! As the morn Jocund ascends, how lovely is the view To him who owns the fair domain! The friend Of his still hours is near, to whom he vowed His truth; her eyes reflect his bliss; his heart Beats high with joy; his little children play, Pleased, in his pathway; one the scattered flowers Straggling collects, the other spreads its arms, In speechless blandishment, upon the neck Of its caressing nurse. Still let us gaze, And image every form of heartfelt joy Which scenes like these bestow, that charm the sight, Yet soothe the spirit. All is quiet here, Yet cheerful as the green sea, when it shines In some still bay, shines in its loneliness Beneath the breeze, that moves, and hardly moves, The placid surface. On the balustrade Of the old bridge, that o'er the moat is thrown, The fisher with his angle leans intent, And turns, from the bright pomp of spreading plains, To watch the nimble fry, that glancing oft Beneath the gray arch shoot! Oh, happiest he Who steals through life, untroubled as unseen! The distant city, with its crowded spires, That dimly shines upon his view, awakes No thought but that of pleasure more composed, As the winds whisper him to sounder sleep. He leans upon the faithful arm of her For whom his youthful heart beat, fondly beat, When life was new: time steals away, yet health And exercise are his; and in these shades, Though sometimes he has mourned a proud world's wrong, He feels an independence that all cares Breasts with a carol of content; he hears The green leaves of his old paternal trees Make music, soothing as they stir: the elm, And poplar with its silvery trunk, that shades The green sward of the bank before his porch, Are to him as companions;—whilst he turns With more endearment to the living smile Of those his infants, who, when he is dead, Shall hear the music of the self-same trees Waving, till years roll on, and their gray hairs Go to the dust in peace. Away, sad thought! Lo! where the morning light, through the dark wood, Upon the window-pane is flung like fire, Hail, Life and Hope; and thou, great work of art, That 'mid this populous and busy swarm Of men dost smile serene, as with the hues Of fairest, grandest Nature; may'st thou speak Not vainly of the endearments and best joys That Nature yields. The manliest heart that swells With honest English feelings,—while the eye, Saddened, but not cast down, beholds far off The darkness of the onward rolling storm,— Charmed for a moment by this mantling view, Its anxious tumults shall suspend: and such, The pensive patriot shall exclaim, thy scenes, My own beloved country, such the abode Of rural peace! and while the soul has warmth, And voice has energy, the brave arm strength, England, thou shalt not fall! The day shall come, Yes, and now is, that thou shalt lift thyself; And woe to him who sets upon thy shores His hostile foot! Proud victor though he be, His bloody march shall never soil a flower That hangs its sweet head, in the morning dew, On thy green village banks! His mustered hosts Shall be rolled back in thousands, and the surge Bury them! Then, when peace illumes once more, My country, thy green nooks and inmost vales, It will be sweet amidst the forest glens To stray, and think upon the distant storm That howled, but injured not! At thoughts like these, What heart, what English heart, but shall beat high! Meantime, its keen flash passed, thine eye intent, Beaumont, shall trace the master-strokes of art, And view the assemblage of the finished piece, As with his skill who formed it: ruder views, Savage, with solitary pines, hung high Amid the broken crags (where scowling wait The fierce banditti), stern Salvator's hand Shall aptly shade: o'er Poussin's clustering domes, With ampler umbrage, the black woods shall hang, Beneath whose waving gloom the sudden flash Of broken light upon the brawling stream Is flung below. Aërial Claude shall paint The gray fane peering o'er the summer woods, The azure lake below, or distant seas, And sails, in the pellucid atmosphere, Soft gleaming to the morn. Dark on the rock, Where the red lightnings burst, shall Wilson stand, Like mighty Shakspeare, whom the imps of fire Await. Nor oh, sweet Gainsborough! shall thee The Muse forget, whose simple landscape smiles Attractive, whether we delight to view The cottage chimney through the high wood peep; Or beggar beauty stretch her little hand, With look most innocent; or homeward kine Wind through the hollow road at eventide, Or browse the straggling branches. Scenes like these Shall charm all hearts, while truth and beauty live, And Nature's pictured loveliness shall own Each master's varied touch; but chiefly thou, Great Rubens! shalt the willing senses lead, Enamoured of the varied imagery, That fills the vivid canvas, swelling still On the enraptured eye of taste, and still New charms unfolding; though minute, yet grand, Simple, yet most luxuriant; every light And every shade, greatly opposed, and all Subserving to one magical effect Of truth and harmony. So glows the scene; And to the pensive thought refined displays The richest rural poem. Oh, may views So pictured animate thy classic mind, Beaumont, to wander 'mid Sicilian scenes, And catch the beauties of the pastoral bard, Shadowing his wildest landscapes! Ætna's fires, Bebrycian rocks, Anapus' holy stream, And woods of ancient Pan; the broken crag And the old fisher here; the purple vines There bending; and the smiling boy set down To guard, who, innocent and happy, weaves, Intent, his rushy basket, to ensnare The chirping grasshoppers, nor sees the while The lean fox meditate her morning meal, Eyeing his scrip askance; whilst further on Another treads the purple grapes—he sits, Nor aught regards, but the green rush he weaves. O Beaumont! let this pomp of light and shade Wake thee, to paint the woods that the sweet Muse Has consecrated: then the summer scenes Of Phasidamus, clad in richer light, Shall glow, the glancing poplars, and clear fount; While distant times admire (as now we trace This summer-mantling view) hoar Ætna's pines, The vine-hung grotts, and branching planes, that shade The silver Arethusa's stealing wave. THE HARP, AND DESPAIR, OF COWPER. Sweet bard, whose tones great Milton might approve, And Shakspeare, from high Fancy's sphere, Turning to the sound his ear, Bend down a look of sympathy and love; Oh, swell the lyre again, As if in full accord it poured an angel's strain! But oh! what means that look aghast, Ev'n whilst it seemed in holy trance, On scenes of bliss above to glance! Was it a fiend of darkness passed! Oh, speak— Paleness is upon his cheek— On his brow the big drops stand, To airy vacancy Points the dread silence of his eye, And the loved lyre it falls, falls from his nerveless hand! Come, peace of mind, delightful guest! Oh, come, and make thy downy nest Once more on his sad heart! Meek Faith, a drop of comfort shed; Sweet Hope, support his aged head; And Charity, avert the burning dart! Fruitless the prayer—the night of deeper woes Seems o'er the head even now to close; In vain the path of purity he trod, In vain, in vain, He poured from Fancy's shell his sweetest hermit strain— He has no hope on earth: forsake him not, O God! STANZAS FOR MUSIC. 1 I trust the happy hour will come, That shall to peace thy breast restore; And that we two, beloved friend, Shall one day meet to part no more. 2 It grieves me most, that parting thus, All my soul feels I dare not speak; And when I turn me from thy sight, The tears in silence wet my cheek. 3 Yet I look forward to the time, That shall each wound of sorrow heal; When I may press thee to my heart, And tell thee all that now I fell. MUSIC. O Music! if thou hast a charm That may the sense of pain disarm, Be all thy tender tones addressed To soothe to peace my Harriet's breast; And bid the magic of thy strain So still the wakeful throb of pain, That, rapt in the delightful measure, Sweet Hope again may whisper pleasure, And seem the notes of Spring to hear, Prelusive to a happier year! And if thy magic can restore The shade of days that smile no more, And softer, sweeter colours give To scenes that in remembrance live; Be to her pensive heart a friend, And, whilst the tender shadows blend, Recall, ere the brief trace be lost, Each moment that she prized the most. Perhaps, when many a cheerful day Hereafter shall have stolen away, If then some old and favourite strain Should bring back to her thoughts again The hours when, silent by her side, I listened to her song and sighed; Perhaps a long-forgotten name, A thought, if not a tear may claim; And when in distant plains away, Alone I count each lingering day, She may a silent prayer prefer For him whose heart once bled for her. ABSENCE. OCTOBER 26, 1791. How shall I cheat the heavy hours, of thee Deprived, of thy kind looks and converse sweet, Now that the waving grove the dark storms beat, And wintry winds sad sounding o'er the lea, Scatter the sallow leaf! I would believe, Thou, at this hour, with tearful tenderness Dost muse on absent images, and press In thought my hand, and say: Oh do not grieve, Friend of my heart! at wayward fortune's power; One day we shall be happy, and each hour Of pain forget, cheered by the summer ray. These thoughts beguile my sorrow for thy loss, And, as the aged pines their dark heads toss, Oft steal the sense of solitude away. So am I sadly soothed, yet do I cast A wishful glance upon the seasons past, And think how different was the happy tide, When thou, with looks of love, wert smiling by my side. FAIRY SKETCH. SCENE—NETLEY ABBEY. There was a morrice on the moonlight plain, And music echoed in the woody glade, For fay-like forms, as of Titania's train, Upon a summer eve, beneath the shade Of Netley's ivied ruins, to the sound Of sprightly minstrelsy did beat the ground:— Come, take hands! and lightly move, While our boat, in yonder cove, Rests upon the darkening sea; Come, take hands, and follow me! Netley! thy dim and desolated fane Hath heard, perhaps, the spirits of the night Shrieking, at times, amid the wind and rain; Or haply, when the full-orbed moon shone bright, Thy glimmering aisles have echoed to the song Of fairy Mab, who led her shadowy masque along. Now, as to the sprightly sound Of moonlight minstrelsy we beat the ground; From the pale nooks, in accent clear, Now, methinks, her voice I hear, Sounding o'er the darksome sea; Come, take hands, and follow me! Here, beneath the solemn wood, When faintly-blue is all the sky, And the moon is still on high, To the murmurs of the flood, To the glimpses of the night, We perform our airy rite;— Care and pain to us unknown, To the darkening seas are flown. Hear no more life's fretful noise, Heed not here pale Envy's sting, Far from life's distempered joys; To the waters murmuring, To the shadows of the sky, To the moon that rides on high, To the glimpses of the night, We perform our airy rite, While care and pain, to us unknown, To the darkening seas are flown. INSCRIPTION. Come, and where these runnels fall, Listen to my madrigal! Far from all sounds of all the strife, That murmur through the walks of life; From grief, inquietude, and fears, From scenes of riot, or of tears; From passions, cankering day by day, That wear the inmost heart away; From pale Detraction's envious spite, That worries where it fears to bite; From mad Ambition's worldly chase, Come, and in this shady place, Be thine Contentment's humble joys, And a life that makes no noise, Save when fancy, musing long, Turns to desultory song; And wakes some lonely melody, Like the water dripping by. Come, and where these runnels fall, Listen to my madrigal! Bremhill Garden, Sept. 1808. PICTURES FROM THEOCRITUS. FROM IDYL I. [Goat-herd, how sweet above the lucid spring] ??? ?? ?? ????????, etc. Goat-herd, how sweet above the lucid spring The high pines wave with breezy murmuring! So sweet thy song, whose music might succeed To the wild melodies of Pan's own reed. THYRSIS. More sweet thy pipe's enchanting melody Than streams that fall from broken rocks on high. Say, by the nymphs, that guard the sacred scene, Where lowly tamarisks shade these hillocks green, At noontide shall we lie? No; for o'erwearied with the forest chase, Pan, the great hunter god, sleeps in this place. Beneath the branching elm, while thy sad verse, O Thyrsis! Daphnis' sorrows shall rehearse, Fronting the wood-nymph's solitary seat, Whose fountains flash amid the dark retreat; Where the old statue leans, and brown oaks wave Their ancient umbrage o'er the pastoral cave; There will we rest, and thou, as erst, prolong The sweet enchantment of the Doric song! FROM THE SAME IDYL. [Mark, where the beetling precipice appears] Mark, where the beetling precipice appears, The toil of the old fisher, gray with years; Mark, as to drag the laden net he strains, The labouring muscle and the swelling veins! There, in the sun, the clustered vineyard bends, And shines empurpled, as the morn ascends! A little boy, with idly-happy mien, To guard the grapes upon the ground is seen; Two wily foxes creeping round appear,— The scrip that holds his morning meal is near,— One breaks the bending vines; with longing lip, And look askance, one eyes the tempting scrip. He plats and plats his rushy net all day, And makes the vagrant grasshopper his prey; He plats his net, intent with idle care, Nor heeds how vineyard, grape, or scrip may fare. FROM THE SAME. [Where were ye, nymphs, when Daphnis drooped with love?] Where were ye, nymphs, when Daphnis drooped with love? In fair Peneus' Tempe, or the grove Of Pindus! Nor your pastimes did ye keep, Where huge Anapus' torrent waters sweep; On Ætna's height, ah! impotent to save, Nor yet where Akis winds his holy wave! FROM THE SAME. [Pan, Pan, oh mighty hunter! whether now] Pan, Pan, oh mighty hunter! whether now, Thou roamest o'er Lyceus' shaggy brow, Or Mœnalaus, outstretched in amplest shade, Thy solitary footsteps have delayed; Leave Helice's romantic rock a while, And haste, oh haste, to the Sicilian isle; Leave the dread monument, approached with fear, That Lycaonian tomb the gods revere. Here cease, Sicilian Muse, the Doric lay;— Come, Forest King, and bear this pipe away; Daphnis, subdued by love, and bowed with woe, Sinks, sinks for ever to the shades below. FROM IDYL VII. [He left us;—we, the hour of parting come] He left us;—we, the hour of parting come, To Prasidamus' hospitable home, Myself and Eucritus, together wend, With young Amynticus, our blooming friend: There, all delighted, through the summer day, On beds of rushes, pillowed deep, we lay; Around, the lentils, newly cut, were spread; Dark elms and poplars whispered o'er our head; A hallowed stream, to all the wood-nymphs dear, Fresh from the rocky cavern murmured near; Beneath the fruit-leaves' many-mantling shade, The grasshoppers a coil incessant made; From the wild thorny thickets, heard remote, The wood-lark trilled his far-resounding note; Loud sung the thrush, musician of the scene, And soft and sweet was heard the dove's sad note between; Then yellow bees, whose murmur soothed the ear, Went idly flitting round the fountain clear. Summer and Autumn seemed at once to meet, Filling with redolence the blest retreat, While the ripe pear came rolling to our feet. FROM IDYL XXII. [When the famed Argo now secure had passed] When the famed Argo now secure had passed The crushing rocks, and that terrific strait That guards the wintry Pontic, the tall ship Reached wild Bebrycia's shores; bearing like gods Her god-descended chiefs. They, from her sides, With scaling steps descend, and on the shore, Savage, and sad, and beat by ocean winds, Strewed their rough beds, and on the casual fire The vessels place. The brothers, by themselves, Castor and red-haired Pollux, wander far Into the forest solitudes. A wood Immense and dark, shagging the mountain side, Before them rose; a cold and sparkling fount Welled with perpetual lapse, beneath its feet, Of purest water clear; scattering below, Streams as of silver and of crystal rose, Bright from the bottom: Pines, of stateliest height, Poplar, and plane, and cypress, branching wide, Were near, thick bordered by the scented flowers That lured the honeyed bee, when spring declines, Thick swarming o'er the meadows. There all day A huge man sat, of savage, wild aspect; His breast stood roundly forward, his broad back Seemed as of iron, such as might befit A vast Colossus sculptured. Full to view The muscles of his brawny shoulders stood, Like the round mountain-stones the torrent wave Has polished; from his neck and back hung down A lion's skin, held by its claws. Him first The red-haired youth addressed: Hail, stranger, hail, And say, what tribes unknown inhabit here! Take to the seas thy Hail: I ask it not, Who never saw before, or thee, or thine. Courage! thou seest not men that are unjust Or cruel. Courage shall I learn from thee! Thy heart is savage; thou art passion's slave. Such as I am thou seest; but land of thine I tread not. Come, these hospitable gifts Accept, and part in peace. No: not from thee. My gifts are yet in store. Say, may we drink Of this clear fount? Ask, when wan thirst has parched Thy lips. What present shall I give to thee? None. Stand before me as a man; lift high Thy brandished arms, and try, weak pugilist, Thy strength. But say, with whom shall I contend? Thou seest him here; nor in his art unskilled. Then what shall be the prize of him who wins? Or thou shalt be my slave, or I be thine. The crested birds so fight. Whether like birds Or lions, for no other prize fight we! He said: and sounded loud his hollow conch; The gaunt Bebrycian brethren, at the sound, With long lank hair, come flocking to the shade Of that vast plain. Then Castor hied, and called The hero chiefs from the Magnesian ship. SKETCHES IN THE EXHIBITION, 1805. What various objects strike with various force, Achilles, Hebe, and Sir Watkin's horse! Here summer scenes, there Pentland's stormy ridge, Lords, ladies, Noah's ark, and Cranford bridge! Some that display the elegant design, The lucid colours, and the flowing line; Some that might make, alas! Walsh Porter stare, And wonder how the devil they got there! LADY M?VE. How clear a strife of light and shade is spread! The face how touched with nature's loveliest red! The eye, how eloquent, and yet how meek! The glow subdued, yet mantling on thy cheek! M?ve! I mark alone thy beauteous face, But all is nature, dignity, and grace! HON. MISS MERCER.—HOPNER. Oh! hide those tempting eyes, that faultless form, Those looks with feeling and with nature warm; The neck, the softly-swelling bosom hide, Nor, wanton gales, blow the light vest aside; For who, when beauties more than life excite Silent applause, can gaze without delight! But innocence, enchanting maid, is thine; Thine eyes in liquid light unconscious shine; And may thy breast no other feelings prove, Than those of sympathy and mutual love! EXHIBITION, 1807. BLIND FIDDLER.—WILKIE. With mirth unfeigned the cottage chimney rings, Though only vocal with four fiddle-strings: And see, the poor blind fiddler draws his bow, And lifts intent his time-denoting toe; While yonder maid, as blythe as birds in June, You almost hear her whistle to the tune! Hard by, a lad, in imitative guise, Fixed, fiddle-like, the broken bellows plies; Before the hearth, with looks of honest joy, The father chirrups to the chattering boy, And snaps his lifted thumbs with mimic glee, To the glad urchin on his mother's knee! MORNING.—TURNER. Up! for the morning shines with welcome ray, And to the sunny seabeach let us stray. What orient hues proclaim the master's hand! How light the wave upon the half-wet sand! How beautiful the sun, as still we gaze, Streams all diffusive through the opening haze! Artist—when to the thunder's pealing sound, Fire mixed with hailstones ran upon the ground, When partial darkness the dread prospect hid, And sole aspired the aged pyramid— Sublimity thy genius seemed to guide O'er Egypt's champaign, desolate and wide; But here delightful beauty reigns alone, And decks the morning scene with graces all her own. KESWICK.—SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT. How shall I praise thee, Beaumont, whose nice skill Can mould the soft and shadowy scene at will; Chastise to harmony each gaudy ray, Simple, yet grand, the mountain scene display; The lake where sober evening seems to sleep, Hills far retiring into umbrage deep; Blend all with classic, pure, poetic taste, And strike the more with forms and colours chaste! MARKET-DAY.—CALCOT. Through the wood's maze our eyes delighted stray, To mark the rustics on the market-day. Beneath the branches winds the long white road; Here peeps the rustic cottager's abode; There in the morning sun, the children play, Or the crone creeps along the dusty way. SCENE IN FRANCE.—LOUTHERBOURG. Artist, I own thy genius; but the touch May be too restless, and the glare too much: And sure none ever saw a landscape shine, Basking in beams of such a sun as thine, But felt a fervid dew upon his phiz, And panting cried, O Lord, how hot it is! DEATH OF NELSON.—WEST. Turn to Britannia's triumphs on the main: See Nelson, pale and fainting, 'mid the slain, Whilst Victory sighs, stern in the garb of war, And points through clouds the rocks of Trafalgar! Here cease the strain; but while thy hulls shall ride, Britain, dark shadowing the tumultuous tide, May other Nelsons, on the sanguine main, Guide, like a god, the battle's hurricane; And when the funeral's transient pomp is past, High hung the banner, hushed the battle's blast, May the brave character to ages shine, And Genius consecrate the immortal shrine! SOUTHAMPTON CASTLE. INSCRIBED TO THE MARQUIS OF LANSDOWNE. The moonlight is without; and I could lose An hour to gaze, though Taste and Splendour here, As in a lustrous fairy palace, reign! Regardless of the lights that blaze within, I look upon the wide and silent sea, That in the shadowy moonbeam sleeps: How still, Nor heard to murmur, or to move, it lies; Shining in Fancy's eye, like the soft gleam, The eve of pleasant yesterdays! The clouds Have all sunk westward, and the host of stars Seem in their watches set, as gazing on; While night's fair empress, sole and beautiful, Holds her illustrious course through the mid heavens Supreme, the spectacle, for such she looks, Of gazing worlds! How different is the scene That lies beneath this arched window's height! The town, that murmured through the busy day, Is hushed; the roofs one solemn breadth of shade Veils; but the towers, and taper spires above, The pinnets, and the gray embattled walls, And masts that throng around the southern pier, Shine all distinct in light; and mark, remote, O'er yonder elms, St Mary's modest fane. Oh! if such views may please, to me they shine How more attractive! but few years have passed, Since there I saw youth, health, and happiness, All circling round an aged sire, whose hairs Are now in peace gone down; he was to me A friend, and almost with a father's smile Hung o'er my infant Muse. The cheerful voice Of fellowship, the song of harmony, And mirth, and wit, were there. That scene is passed: Cold death and separation have dissolved The evening circle of once-happy friends! So has it ever fared, and so must fare, With all! I see the moonlight watery tract That shines far off, beneath the forest-shades: What seems it, but the mirror of that tide, Which noiseless, 'mid the changes of the world, Holds its inevitable course, the tide Of years departing; to the distant eye Still seeming motionless, though hurrying on From morn till midnight, bearing, as it flows, The sails of pleasurable barks! These gleam To-day, to-morrow other passing sails Catch the like sunshine of the vernal morn. Our pleasant days are as the moon's brief light On the pale ripple, passing as it shines! But shall the pensive bard for this lament, Who knows how transitory are all worlds Before His eye who made them! Cease the strain; And welcome still the social intercourse That soothes the world's loud jarring, till the hour When, universal darkness wrapping all This nether scene, a light from heaven shall stream Through clouds dividing, and a voice be heard: Here only pure and lasting bliss is found! THE WINDS. When dark November bade the leaves adieu, And the gale sung amid the sea-boy's shrouds, Methought I saw four winged forms, that flew, With garments streaming light, amid the clouds; From adverse regions of the sky, In dim succession, they went by. The first, as o'er the billowy deep he passed, Blew from its brazen trump a far-resounding blast. Upon a beaked promontory high, With streaming heart, and cloudy brow severe, Marked ye the father of the frowning year! Dark vapours rolled o'er the tempestuous sky, When creeping Winter from his cave came forth; Stern courier of the storm, he cried, what from the north? NORTH WIND. From the vast and desert deeps, Where the lonely Kraken sleeps, Where fixed the icy mountains high Glimmer to the twilight sky; Where, six lingering months to last, The night has closed, the day is past, Father, lo, I come, I come: I have heard the wizard's drum, And the withered Lapland hag, Seal, with muttered spell, her bag: O'er mountains white, and forests sere, I flew, and with a wink am here. WINTER. Spirit of unwearied wing, From the Baltic's frozen main, From the Russ's bleak domain, Say, what tidings dost thou bring! Shouts, and the noise of battle! and again The winged wind blew loud a deadly blast; Shouts, and the noise of battle! the long main Seemed with hoarse voice to answer as he passed. The moody South went by, and silence kept; The cloudy rack oft hid his mournful mien, And frequent fell the showers, as if he wept The eternal havoc of this mortal scene. He had heard the yell, and cry, And howling dance of Anarchy, Where the Rhone, with rushing flood, Murmured to the main, through blood:— He seemed to wish he could for ever throw His misty mantle o'er a world of woe. But rousing him from his desponding trance, Cold Eurus blew his sharp and shrilling horn; In his right hand he bore an icy lance, That far off glittered in the frost of morn; The old man knew the clarion from afar, What from the East? he cried. EAST WIND. Shouts, and the noise of war! Far o'er the land hath been my flight, O'er many a forest dark as night, O'er champaigns where the Tartar speeds, O'er Wolga's wild and giant reeds, O'er the Carpathian summits hoar, Beneath whose snows and shadows frore, Poland's level length unfolds Her trackless woods and wildering wolds, Like a spirit, seeking rest, I have passed from east to west, While sounds of discord and lament Rose from the earth where'er I went. I care not; hurrying, as in scorn, I shook my lance, and blew my horn; The day shows clear; and merrily Along the Atlantic now I fly. Who comes in soft and spicy vest, From the mild regions of the West? An azure veil bends waving o'er his head, And showers of violets from his hands are shed. 'Tis Zephyr, with a look as young and fair As when his lucid wings conveyed That beautiful and gentle maid Psyche, transported through the air, The blissful couch of Love's own god to share. Winter, avaunt! thy haggard eye Will scare him, as he wanders by, Him and the timid butterfly. He brings again the morn of May; The lark, amid the clear blue sky, Carols, but is not seen so high, And all the winter's winds fly far away! I cried: O Father of the world, whose might The storm, the darkness, and the winds obey, Oh, when will thus the long tempestuous night Of warfare and of woe be rolled away! Oh, when will cease the uproar and the din, And Peace breathe soft, Summer is coming in! ON WILLIAM SOMMERS OF BREMHILL. When will the grave shelter thy few gray hairs, O aged man! Thy sand is almost run, And many a year, in vain, to meet the sun, Thine eyes have rolled in darkness; want and cares Have been thy visitants from morn to morn. While trembling on existence thou dost live, Accept what human charity can give; But standing thus, time-palsied, and forlorn, Like a scathed oak, of all its boughs bereft, God and the grave are thy best refuge left. When the bells rung, and summer's smiling ray Welcomed again the merry Whitsuntide, And all my humble villagers were gay; I saw thee sitting on the highway side, To feel once more the warm sun's blessed beam: Didst thou then think upon thy own gay prime, On such a holiday, and the glad time When thou wert young and happy, like a dream Now perished! No; the murmured prayer alone Rose from the trembling lips towards the Throne Of Mercy; that ere spring returned again, And the long winter blew its dreary blast, To sweep the verdure from the fading plain, Thy burden would be dropped, thy sorrows past! O blind and aged man, bowed down with cares, When will the grave shelter thy few gray hairs! THE VISIONARY BOY. Oh! lend that lute, sweet Archimage, to me! Enough of care and heaviness The weary lids of life depress, And doubly blest that gentle heart shall be, That wooes of poesy the visions bland, And strays forgetful o'er enchanted land! Oh! lend that lute, sweet Archimage, to me! So spoke, with ardent look, yet eyebrow sad, When he had passed o'er many a mountain rude, And many a wild and weary solitude, 'Mid a green vale, a wandering minstrel-lad. With eyes that shone in softened flame, With wings and wand, young Fancy came; And as she touched a trembling lute, The lone enthusiast stood entranced and mute. It was a sound that made his soul forego All thoughts of sadness in a world of woe. Oh, lend that lute! he cried: Hope, Pity, Love, Shall listen; and each valley, rock, and grove, Shall witness, as with deep delight, From orient morn to dewy-stealing night. My spirit, rapt in trance of sweetness high, Shall drink the heartfelt sound with tears of ecstasy! As thus he spoke, soft voices seemed to say, Come away, come away; Where shall the heart-sick minstrel stray, But (viewing all things like a dream) By haunted wood, or wizard stream? That, like a hermit weeping, Amid the gray stones creeping; With voice distinct, yet faint, Calls on Repose herself to hear its soothing plaint. For him, romantic Solitude Shall pile sublime her mountains rude; For him, with shades more soft impressed, The lucid lake's transparent breast Shall show the banks, the woods, the hill, More clear, more beautiful, more still. For him more musical shall wave The pines o'er Echo's moonlit cave; While sounds as of a fairy lyre Amid the shadowy cliffs expire! This valley where the raptured minstrel stood Was shaded with a circling slope of wood, And rich in beauty, with that valley vied, Thessalian Tempe, crowned with verdant bay, Where smooth and clear Peneus winds his way; And Ossa and Olympus, on each side, Rise dark with woods; or that Sicilian plain Which Arethusa's clearest waters lave, By many a haunt of Pan, and wood-nymph's cave, Lingering and listening to the Doric strain Of him, the bard whose music might succeed To the wild melodies of Pan's own reed! This scene the mistress of the valley held, Fancy, a magic maid; and at her will, Aërial castles crowned the gleaming hill, Or forests rose, or lapse of water welled. Sometimes she sat with lifted eye, And marked the dark storm in the western sky; Sometimes she looked, and scarce her breath would draw, As fearful things, not to be told, she saw; And sometimes, like a vision of the air, On wings of shifting light she floated here and there. In the breeze her garments flew, Of the brightest skiey blue, Lucid as the tints of morn, When Summer trills his pipe of corn: Her tresses to each wing descending fall, Or, lifted by the wind, Stream loose and unconfined, Like golden threads, beneath her myrtle coronal. The listening passions stood aloof and mute, As oft the west wind touched her trembling lute. But when its sounds the youthful minstrel heard, Strange mingled feelings, not to be expressed, Rose undefined, yet blissful, on his breast, And all the softened scene in sweeter light appeared. Then Fancy waved her wand, and lo! An airy troop went beckoning by: Come, from toil and worldly woe; Come, live with us in vales remote! they cry. These are the flitting phantasies; the dreams That lead the heart through all that elfin land, Where half-seen shapes entice with whispers bland. Meantime the clouds, impressed with livelier beams, Roll, in the lucid track of air, Arrayed in coloured brede, with semblances more fair. The airy troop, as on they sail, Thus the pensive stranger hail: In the pure and argent sky, There our distant chambers lie; The bed is strewed with blushing roses, When Quietude at eve reposes, Oft trembling lest her bowers should fade, In the cold earth's humid shade. Come, rest with us! evanishing, they cried— Come, rest with us! the lonely vale replied. Then Fancy beckoned, and with smiling mien, A radiant form arose, like the fair Queen Of Beauty: from her eye divinely bright, A richer lustre shot, a more attractive light. She said: With fairer tints I can adorn The living landscape, fairer than the morn. The summer clouds in shapes romantic rolled, And those they edge the fading west, like gold; The lake that sleeps in sunlight, yet impressed With shades more sweet than real on its breast; 'Mid baffling stones, beneath a partial ray, The small brook huddling its uneven way; The blue far distant hills, the silvery sea, And every scene of summer speaks of me: But most I wake the sweetest wishes warm, Where the fond gaze is turned on woman's breathing form. So passing silent through a myrtle grove, Beauty first led him to the bower of Love. A mellow light through the dim covert strayed, And opening roses canopied the shade. Why does the hurrying pulse unbidden leap! Behold, in yonder glade that nymph asleep! The heart-struck minstrel hangs, with lingering gaze, O'er every charm his eye impassioned strays! An edge of white is seen, and scarcely seen, As soft she breathes, her coral lips between; A lambent ray steals from her half-closed eye, As her breast heaves a short imperfect sigh. Sleep, winds of summer, o'er the leafy bower, Nor move the light bells of the nodding flower; Lest but a sound of stirring leaves might seem To break the charm of her delicious dream! And ye, fond, rising, throbbing thoughts, away, Lest syren Pleasure all the soul betray! Oh! turn, and listen to the ditty From the lowly cave of Pity. On slaughter's plain, while Valour grieves, There he sunk to rest, And the ring-dove scattered leaves Upon his bleeding breast! Her face was hid, while her pale arms enfold What seemed an urn of alabaster cold; To this she pressed her heaving bosom bare: The drops that gathered in the dank abode Fell dripping, on her long dishevelled hair; And still her tears, renewed, and silent, flowed: And when the winds of autumn ceased to swell, At times was heard a slow and melancholy knell! 'Twas in the twilight of the deepest wood, Beneath whose boughs (like sad Cocytus, famed Through fabling Greece, from lamentation named A river dark and silent flowed, there stood A pale and melancholy man, intent His look upon that drowsy stream he bent, As ever counting, when the fitful breeze With strange and hollow sound sung through the trees, Counting the sallow leaves, that down the current went. He saw them not: Earth seemed to him one universal blot. Sometimes, as most distempered, to and fro He paced; and sometimes fixed his chilling look Upon a dreadful book, Inscribed with secret characters of woe; While gibbering imps, as mocking him, appeared, And airy laughter 'mid the dusk was heard. Then Fancy waved her wand again, And all that valley that so lovely smiled Was changed to a bare champaign, waste and wild. “What pale and phantom-horseman rides amain?” 'Tis Terror;—all the plain, far on, is spread With skulls and bones, and relics of the dead! From his black trump he blew a louder blast, And earthquakes muttered as the giant passed. Then said that magic maid, with aspect bland, 'Tis thine to seize his phantom spear, 'Tis thine his sable trumpet to command, And thrill the inmost heart with shuddering fear. But hark! to Music's softer sound, New scenes and fairer views accordant rise: Above, around, The mingled measure swells in air, and dies. Music, in thy charmed shell, What sounds of holy magic dwell! Oft when that shell was to the ear applied, Confusion of rich harmonies, All swelling rose, That came, as with a gently-swelling tide: Then at the close, Angelic voices seemed, aloft, To answer as it died the cadence soft. Now, like the hum of distant ocean's stream, The murmurs of the wond'rous concave seem; And now exultingly their tones prolong The chorded pæans of the choral song, Then Music, with a voice more wildly sweet Than winds that pipe on the forsaken shore, When the last rain-drops of the west are o'er, Warbled: Oh, welcome to my blest retreat, And give my sounds to the responsive lyre: With me to these melodious groves retire, And such pure feelings share, As, far from noise and folly, soothe thee there. Here Fancy, as the prize were won, And now she hailed her favourite son, With energy impatient cried: The weary world is dark and wide, Lo! I am with thee still to comfort and to guide. Nor fear, if, grim before thine eyes, Pale worldly Want, a spectre, lowers; What is a world of vanities To a world as sweet as ours! When thy heart is sad and lone, And loves to dwell on pleasures flown, When that heart no more shall bound At some kind voice's well-known sound, My spells thy drooping languor shall relieve, And airy spirits touch thy lonely harp at eve. Look!—Delight and Hope advancing, Music joins her thrilling notes, O'er the level lea come dancing; Seize the vision as it floats, Bright-eyed Rapture hovers o'er them, Waving light his seraph wings, Youth exulting flies before them, Scattering cowslips as he sings! Come now, my car pursue, The wayward Fairy cried; And high amid the fields of air, Above the clouds, together we will ride, And posting on the viewless winds, So leave the cares of earth and all its thoughts behind. I can sail, and I can fly, To all regions of the sky, On the shooting meteor's course, On a winged griffin-horse! She spoke: when Wisdom's self drew nigh, A noble sternness in her searching eye; Like Pallas helmed, and in her hand a spear, As not in idle warfare bent, but still, As resolute, to cope with every earthly ill. In youthful dignity severe, She stood: And shall the aspiring mind, To Fancy be alone resigned! Alas! she cried, her witching lay Too often leads the heart astray! Still, weak minstrel, wouldst thou rove, Drooping in the distant grove, Forgetful of all ties that bind Thee, a brother, to mankind? Has Fancy's feeble voice defied The ills to poor humanity allied? Can she, like Wisdom, bid thy soul sustain Its post of duty in a life of pain! Can she, like meek Religion, bid thee bear Contempt and hardship in a world of care! Yet let not my rebuke decry, In all, her blameless witchery, Or from the languid bosom tear Each sweet illusion nourished there. With dignity and truth, combined, Still may she rule the manly mind; Her sweetest magic still impart To soften, not subdue, the heart: Still may she warm the chosen breast, Not as the sovereign, but the guest. Then shall she lead the blameless Muse Through all her fairest, wildest views; To mark amid the flowers of morn, The bee go forth with early horn; Or when the moon, a softer light Sheds on the rocks and seas of night, To hear the circling fairy bands Sing, Come unto these yellow sands! Sweeter is our light than day, Fond enthusiast, come away! Then Chivalry again shall call The champions to her bannered hall! The pipe, and song, with many a mingled shout, Ring through the forest, as the satyr-rout, Dance round the dragon-chariot of Romance; Forth pricks the errant knight with rested lance; Imps, demons, fays, in antic train succeed, The wandering maiden, and the winged steed! The muttering wizard turns, with haggard look, The bloody leaves of the accursed book, Whilst giants, from the gloomy castle tower, With lifted bats of steel, more dreadful lower! At times, the magic shall prevail Of the wild and wonderous tale; At times, high rapture shall prolong The deep, enthusiastic song. Hence, at midnight, thou shalt stray, Where dark ocean flings its spray, To hear o'er heaven's resounding arch The Thunder-Lord begin his march! Or mark the flashes, that present Some far-off shattered monument; Whilst along the rocky vale, Red fires, mingled with the hail, Run along upon the ground, And the thunders deeper sound! The loftier Muse, with awful mien, Upon a lonely rock is seen: Full is the eye that speaks the dauntless soul; She seems to hear the gathering tempest roll Beneath her feet; she bids an eagle fly, Breasting the whirlwind, through the dark-red sky; Or, with elated look, lifts high the spear, As sounds of distant battles roll more near. Now deep-hushed in holy trance, She sees the powers of Heaven advance, And wheels, instinct with spirit, bear God's living chariot through the air; Now on the wings of morn she seems to rise, And join the strain of more than mortal harmonies. Thy heart shall beat exulting as she sings, And thou shalt cry: Give me an angel's wings! With sadder sound, o'er Pity's cave, The willow in the wind shall wave; And all the listening passions stand, Obedient to thy great command. With Poesy's sweet charm impressed, Fancy thus shall warm thy breast; Still her smiling train be thine, Still her lovely visions shine, To cheer, beyond my boasted power, A sad or solitary hour. Thus let them soothe a while thy heart, “Come like shadows, so depart;” But never may the witching lay Lead each sense from life astray; For vain the poet's muse of fire, Vain the magic of his lyre, Unless the touch subdued impart Truth and wisdom to the heart! CADLAND, SOUTHAMPTON RIVER. If ever sea-maid, from her coral cave, Beneath the hum of the great surge, has loved To pass delighted from her green abode, And, seated on a summer bank, to sing No earthly music; in a spot like this, The bard might feign he heard her, as she dried Her golden hair, yet dripping from the main, In the slant sunbeam. So the pensive bard Might image, warmed by this enchanting scene, The ideal form; but though such things are not, He who has ever felt a thought refined; He who has wandered on the sea of life, Forming delightful visions of a home Of beauty and repose; he who has loved, With filial warmth his country, will not pass Without a look of more than tenderness On all the scene; from where the pensile birch Bends on the bank, amid the clustered group Of the dark hollies; to the woody shore That steals diminished, to the distant spires Of Hampton, crowning the long lucid wave. White in the sun, beneath the forest-shade, Full shines the frequent sail, like Vanity, As she goes onward in her glittering trim, Amid the glances of life's transient morn, Calling on all to view her! Vectis there, That slopes its greensward to the lambent wave, And shows through softest haze its woods and domes, With gray St Catherine's creeping to the sky, Seems like a modest maid, who charms the more Concealing half her beauties. To the East, Proud, yet complacent, on its subject realm, With masts innumerable thronged, and hulls Seen indistinct, but formidable, mark Albion's vast fleet, that like the impatient storm, Waits but the word to thunder and flash death On him who dares approach to violate The shores and living scenes that smile secure Beneath its dragon-watch! Long may they smile! And long, majestic Albion (while the sound From East to West, from Albis to the Po, Of dark contention hurtles), may'st thou rest, As calm and beautiful this sylvan scene Looks on the refluent wave that steals below. THE LAST SONG OF CAMOENS. The morning shone on Tagus' rocky side, And airs of summer swelled the yellow tide, When, rising from his melancholy bed, And faint, and feebly by Antonio led, Poor Camoens, subdued by want and woe, Along the winding margin wandered slow. His harp, that once could each warm feeling move Of patriot glory or of tenderest love, His sole and sable friend (while a faint tone Rose from the wires) placed by a mossy stone. How beautiful the sun ascending shines From ridge to ridge, along the purple vines! How pure the azure of the opening skies! How resonant the nearer rock replies To call of early mariners! and, hark! The distant whistle from yon parting bark, That down the channel as serene she strays, Her gray sail mingles with the morning haze, Bound to explore, o'er ocean's stormy reign, New lands that lurk amid the lonely main! A transient fervour touched the old man's breast; He raised his eyes, so long by care depressed, And while they shone with momentary fire, Ardent he struck the long-forgotten lyre. From Tagus' yellow-sanded shore, O'er the billows, as they roar, O'er the blue sea, waste and wide, Our bark threw back the burning tide, By northern breezes cheer'ly borne, On to the kingdoms of the morn. Blanco, whose cold shadow vast Chills the western wave, is past! Huge Bojador, frowning high, Thy dismal terrors we defy! But who may violate the sleep And silence of the sultry deep; Where, beneath the intenser sun, Hot showers descend, red lightnings run; Whilst all the pale expanse beneath Lies burning wide, without a breath; And at mid-day from the mast, No shadow on the deck is cast! Night by night, still seen the same, Strange lights along the cordage flame, Perhaps, the spirits of the good, That wander this forsaken flood Sing to the seas, as slow we float, A solemn and a holy note! Spectre of the southern main, Thou barr'st our onward way in vain, Wrapping the terrors of thy form, In the thunder's rolling storm! Fearless o'er the indignant tide, On to the east our galleys ride. Triumph! for the toil is o'er— We kiss the far-sought Indian shore! Glittering to the orient ray, The banners of the Cross display! Does my heart exulting bound? Alas, forlorn, I gaze around: Feeble, poor, and old, I stand, A stranger in my native land! My sable slave (ah, no! my only friend, Whose steps upon my rugged path attend) Sees, but with tenderness that fears to speak, The tear that trickles down my aged cheek! My harp is silent,—famine shrinks mine eye,— “Give me a little food for charity!” THE SYLPH OF SUMMER. God said, Let there be light, and there was light! At once the glorious sun, at his command, From space illimitable, void and dark, Sprang jubilant, and angel hierarchies, Whose long hosannahs pealed from orb to orb, Sang, Glory be to Thee, God of all worlds! Then beautiful the ball of this terrene Rolled in the beam of first-created day, And all its elements obeyed the voice Of Him, the great Creator; Air, and Fire, And Earth, and Water, each its ministry Performed, whilst Chaos from his ebon throne Leaped up; and so magnificent, and decked, And mantled in its ambient atmosphere, The living world began its state! To thee, Spirit of Air, I lift the venturous song, Whose viewless presence fills the living scene, Whose element ten thousand thousand wings Fan joyous; o'er whose fields the morning clouds Ride high; whose rule the lightning-shafts obey, And the deep thunder's long-careering march! The Winds too are thy subjects; from the breeze, That, like a child upon a holiday, On the high mountain's van pursues the down Of the gray thistle, ere the autumnal shower Steals soft, and mars his pastime; to the King Of Hurricanes, that sounds his mighty shell, And bids Tornado sweep the Western world. Sylph of the Summer Gale, on thee I call! Oh, come, when now gay June is in her car, Wafting the breath of roses as she moves; Come to this garden bower, which I have hung With tendrils, and the fragrant eglantine, And mandrake, rich with many mantling stars! 'Tis pleasant, when thy breath is on the leaves Without, to rest in this embowering shade, And mark the green fly, circling to and fro, O'er the still water, with his dragon wings, Shooting from bank to bank, now in quick turns, Then swift athwart, as is the gazer's glance, Pursuing still his mate; they, with delight, As if they moved in morris, to the sound Harmonious of this ever-dripping rill, Now in advance, now in retreat, now round, Dart through their mazy rings, and seem to say: The Summer and the Sun are ours! But thou, Sylph of the Summer Gale, delay a while Thy airy flight, whilst here Francesca leans, And, charmed by Ossian's harp, seems in the breeze To hear Malvina's plaint; thou to her ear Come unperceived, like music of the song From Cona's vale of streams; then with the bee, That sounds his horn, busied from flower to flower, Speed o'er the yellow meadows, breathing ripe Their summer incense; or amid the furze, That paints with bloom intense the upland crofts, With momentary essence tinge thy wings; Or in the grassy lanes, one after one, Lift light the nodding foxglove's purple bell. Thence, to the distant sea, and where the flag Hangs idly down, without a wavy curl, Thou hoverest o'er the topmast, or dost raise The full and flowing mainsail: Steadily, The helmsman cries, as now thy breath is heard Among the stirring cordage o'er his head; So, steadily, he cries, as right he steers, Speeds our proud ship along the world of waves. Sylph, may thy favouring breath more gently blow, More gently round the temples and the cheek Of him, who, leaving home and friends behind, In silence musing o'er the ocean leans, And watches every passing shade that marks The southern Channel's fast-retiring line; Then, as the ship rolls on, keeps a long look Fixed on the lessening Lizard, the last point Of that delightful country, where he left All his fond hopes behind: it lessens still; Still, still it lessens, and now disappears! He turns, and only sees the waves that rock Boundless. How many anxious morns shall rise, How many moons shall light the farthest seas, O'er what new scenes and regions shall he stray, A weary man, still thinking of his home, Ere he again that shore shall view, and greet With blissful thronging hopes and starting tears, Of heartfelt welcome, and of warmest love! Perhaps, ah! never! So didst thou go forth, My poor lost brother! The airs of morning as enticing played, And gently, round thee, and their whisperings Might sooth (if aught could sooth) a boding heart; For thou wert bound to visit scenes of death, Where the sick gale (alas! unlike the breeze That bore the gently-swelling sail along) Was tainted with the breath of pestilence, That smote the silent camp, and night and day Sat mocking on the putrid carcases. Thou too didst perish! As the south-west blows, Thy bones, perhaps, now whiten on the coast Of old Algarva. I, meantime, these shades Of village solitude, hoping erewhile To welcome thee from many a toil restored, Still deck, and now thy empty urn alone I meet, where, swaying in the summer gale, The willow whispers in my evening walk. Sylph, in thy airy robe, I see thee float, A rainbow o'er thy head, and in thy hand The magic instrument, that, as thy wing, Lucid, and painted like the butterfly's, Waves to and from, most musically rings; Sometimes in joyance, as the flaunting leaf Of the white poplar, sometimes sad and slow, As bearing pensive airs from Pity's grave. Soft child of air, thou tendest on his sway, As gentle Ariel at the bidding hies Of mighty Prospero; yet other winds Throng to his wizard 'hest, inspiring some, Some melancholy, and yet soothing much The drooping wanderer in the fading copse; Some terrible, with solitude and death Attendant on their march:—the wild Simoom, Riding on whirling spires of burning sand, That move along the Nubian wilderness, And bury deep the silent caravan;— Monsoon, up-starting from his half-year sleep, Upon the vernal shores of Hindostan, And tempesting with sounds of torrent rain, And hail, the darkening main;—and red Sameel, Blasting and withering, like a rivelled leaf, The pilgrim as he roams;—Sirocco sad, That pants, all summer, on the cloudless shores Of faint Parthenope;—deep in the mine Oft lurks the lurid messenger of death, The ghastly fiend that blows, when the pale light Quivers, and leaves the gasping wretch to die;— The imp, that when the hollow curfew knolls, Wanders the misty marish, lighting it At night with errant and fantastic flame. Spirit of air, these are thy ministers, That wait thy will; but thou art all in all, And dead without thee were the flower, the leaf, The waving forest rivelled, the great sea Still, the lithe birds of heaven extinct, and ceased The soul of melting music. This fair scene Lives in thy tender touch, for so it seems; Whilst universal nature owns thy sway; From the mute insect on the summer pool, That with long cobweb legs, firm as on earth The ostrich skims, flits idly to and fro, Making no dimple on the watery mass; To the huge grampus, spouting, as he rolls, A cataract, amid the cold clear sky, And furrowing far and wide the northern deep. Thy presence permeates and fills the whole! As the poor butterfly, that, painted gay, With mealy wings, red, amber, white, or dropped With golden stains, floats o'er the yellow corn, Idly, as bent on pastime, while the morn Smiles on his devious voyage; if inclosed In the exhausted prison, whence thy breath With suction slow is drawn, he feels the change How dire! in palsied inanition drops! Weak flags his weary wing, and weaker yet; His frame with tremulous convulsion moves A moment, and the next is still in death. So were the great and glorious world itself; The tenants of its continents, all ceased! A wide, a motionless, a putrid waste, Its seas! How droops the languid mariner, When not a breath, along the sluggish main, Strays on the sultry surface as it sleeps; When far away the winds are flown, to dash The congregated ocean on the Cape Of Southern Africa, leaving the while The flood's vast surface noiseless, waveless, white, Beneath Mozambique's long-reflected woods, A gleaming mirror, spread from east to west, Where the still ship, as on a bed of glass, Sits motionless. Awake, ye hurricanes! Ye winds that harrow up the wintry waste, Awake! for Thunder in his sounding car, Flashing thick lightning from the rolling wheels, And the red volley, charged with instant death, Were music to this lingering, sickening calm, The same eternal sunshine; still, all still, Without a vapour, or a sound. If thus, Beneath the burning, breathless atmosphere, Faint Nature sickening droop; who shall ascend The height, where Silence, since the world began, Has sat on Cimborazzo's highest peak, A thousand toises o'er the cloud's career, Soaring in finest ether? Far below, He sees the mountains burning at his feet, Whose smoke ne'er reached his forehead; never there, Though the black whirlwind shake the distant shores, The passing gale has murmured; never there The eagle's cry has echoed; never there The solitary condor's weary wing Hath yet ascended! Let the rising thought Beyond the confines of this vapoury vault Be lifted, to the boundless void of space, How dread, how infinite! where other worlds, Ten million and ten million leagues aloft, In other precincts with their shadows roll. There roams the sole erratic comet, borne With lightning speed, yet twice three hundred years Its destined course accomplishing. Then whirled, Far from the attractive orb of central fire, Back through the dim and infinite abyss, Dread flaming visitant, ere thou return'st, Empires may rise and fail; the palaces, That shone on earth, may vanish like the dews Of morning, scarce illumined ere they fly. Dread flaming visitant, who that pursues Thy long and lonely voyage, ev'n in thought, (Till thought itself seem in the effort lost,) But tremblingly exclaims, There is a God: There is a God who lights ten thousand suns, Round which revolve worlds wheeling amid worlds. He launched thy voyage through the vast abyss, He hears his universe, through all its orbs, As with one voice, proclaim. There is a God! Lifted above this dim diurnal sphere, So fancy, rising with her theme, ascends, And voyaging the illimitable void, Where comets flame, sees other worlds and suns Emerge, and on this earth, like a dim speck, Looks down: nor in the wonderful and vast Of the dread scene magnificent, she views Alone the Almighty Ruler, but the web That shines in summer time, and only seen In the slant sunbeam, wakes a moral thought. In autumn, when the thin long spider gains The leafy bush's top, he from his seat Shoots the soft filament, like threads of air, Scarce seen, into the sky; and thus sustained, Boldly ascends into the breezy void, Dependent on the trembling line he wove, Insidious, and intent on scenes of spoil And death:—So mounts Ambition, and aloft On his proud summit meditates new scenes Of plunder and dominion, till the breeze Of fortune change, that blows to empty air His feeble, frail support, and once again Leaves him a reptile, struggling in the dust! But what the world itself, what in His view Whose dread Omnipotence is over all! A twinkling air-thread in the vast of space. And what the works of that proud insect, Man! His mausoleums, fanes, and pyramids, Frown in the dusk of long-revolving years, While generations, as they rise and drop, Each following each to silence and to dust, Point as they pass, and say, It was a God That made them: but nor date, nor name Oblivion shows; cloud only, rolling on, And wrapping darker as it rolls, the works Of man! Now raised on Contemplation's wing, The blue vault, fervent with unnumbered stars, He ranges: speeds, as with an angel's flight, From orb to orb; sees distant suns illume The boundless space, then bends his head to earth, So poor is all he knows! O'er sanguine fields Now rides he, armed and crested like the god Of fabled battles; where he points, pale Death Strides over weltering carcases; nor leaves,— But still a horrid shadow, step by step, Stalks mocking after him, till now the noise Of rolling acclamation, and the shout Of multitude on multitude, is past: The scene of all his triumphs, wormy earth, Closes upon his perishable pride; For “dust he is, and shall to dust return”! But Conscience, a small voice from heaven replies, Conscience shall meet him in another world. Let man, then, walk meek, humble, pure, and just; Though meek, yet dignified; though humble, raised, The heir of life and immortality; Conscious that in this awful world he stands, He only of all living things, ordained To think, and know, and feel, there is a God! Child of the air, though most I love to hear Thy gentle summons whisper, when the Spring, At the first carol of the village lark, Looks out and smiles, or June is in her car; Not undelightful is the purer air In winter, when the keen north-east is high, When frost fantastic his cold garland weaves Of brittle flowers, or soft-succeeding snows Gather without apace, and heavy load The berried sweetbrier, clinging to my pane. The blackbird, then, that marks the ruddy pods Peep through the snow, though silent is his song, Yet, pressed by cold and hunger, ventures near. The robin group, familiar, muster round The garden-shed, where, at his dinner set, The laboured hind strews here and there a crumb From his brown bread; then heedless of the winds That blow without, and sweep the shivered snow, Sees from his broken tube the smoke ascend On an inverted barrow, as in state He sits, though poor, the monarch of the scene, As pondering deep the garden's future state, His kingdom; the rude instruments of death Lie at his feet, fashioned with simple skill, With which he hopes to snare the prowling race, The mice, rapacious of his vernal hopes. So seated, on the spring he ruminates, And solemn as a sophi, moves nor hand, Nor eye, till haply some more venturous bird, (The crumbs exhausted that he lately strewed Upon the groundsill,) with often dipping beak, And sidelong look, as asking larger dole, Comes hopping to his feet: and say, ye great, Ye mighty monarchs of this earthly scene, What nobler views can elevate the heart Of a proud patriot king, than thus to chase The bold rapacious spoilers from the field, And with an eye of merciful regard To look on humble worth, wet from the storm, And chilled by indigence! But thoughts like these Ill suit the radiant summer's rosy prime, And the still temper of the calm blue sky. The sunny shower is past; at intervals The silent glittering drops descend; and mark, Upon the blue bank of yon western cloud, That looms direct against the emerging orb, How bright, how beautiful the rainbow's hues Steal out, how stately bends the graceful arch Above the hills, and tinging at his foot The mead and trees! Fancy might think young Hope Pants for the vision, and with ardent eye Pursues the unreal shade, and spreads her hands, Weeping to see it fade, as all her dreams Have faded. These, O Air! are but the toys, That sometimes deck thy fairy element; So oft the eye observant loves to trace The colours, and the shadows, and the forms, That wander o'er the veering atmosphere. See, in the east, the rare parhelia shine In mimic glory, and so seem to mock (Fixed parallel to the ascending orb) The majesty, the splendour, and the shape, Of the sole luminary that informs The world with light and heat! The halo-ring Bends over all! With desultory shafts, And long and arrowy glance, the night-lights shoot Pale coruscations o'er the northern sky; Now lancing to the cope, in sheets of flame, Now wavering wild, as the reflected wave, On the arched roof of the umbrageous grot. Hence Superstition dreams of armaments, Of fiery conflicts, and of bleeding fields Of slaughter; so on great Jerusalem, Ere yet she fell, the flaming meteor glared; A waving sword ensanguined seemed to point To the devoted city, and a voice Was heard, Depart, depart! The atmosphere, That with the ceaseless hurry of its clouds, Encircles the round globe, resembles oft The passing sunshine, or the glooms that stray O'er every human spirit. Thin light streaks Of thought pass vapoury o'er the vacant mind, And fade to nothing. Now fantastic gleams Play, flashing or expiring, of gay hope, Or deep despair; then clouds of sadness close In one dark settled gloom, and all the man Droops, in despondence lost. Aërial tints Please most the pensive poet: and the views He forms, though evanescent, and as vain As the air's mockery, seem to his eye Ev'n as substantial images, and shapes, Till in a hurrying rack they all dissolve. So in the cloudless sky, amusive shines The soft and mimic scenery; distant hills That, in refracted light, hang beautiful Beneath the golden car of eve, ere yet The daylight lingering fades. Hence, on the heights Of Apennine, far stretching to the south, The goat-herd, while the westering sun, far off, Hangs o'er the hazy ocean's brim, beholds In the horizon's faintly-glowing verge A landscape, like the rainbow, rise, with rocks That softened shine, and shores that trend away, Beneath the winding woods of Sicily, And Etna, smouldering in the still pale sky; And dim Messina, with her spires, and bays That wind among the mountains, and the tower Of Faro, gleaming on the tranquil straits; Unreal all, yet on the air impressed, From light's refracted ray, the shadow seems The certain scene: the hind astonished views, Yet most delighted, till at once the light Changes, and all has vanished! But to him, How different in still air the unreal view, Who wanders in Arabian solitudes, When, faint with thirst, he sees illusive streams Shine in the arid desert! All around, A silent waste of dark gray sand is spread, Like ashes; not a speck in heaven appears, But the red sun, high in his burning noon, Shoots down intolerable fire: no sound Of beast, or blast, or moving insect, stirs The horrid stillness. Oh! what hand will guide The pilgrim, panting in the trackless dust, To where the pure and sparkling fountain cheers The green oasis. See, as now his lip Hangs parched and quivering, see before him spread The long and level lake! He gazes; still He gazes, till he drops upon the sands, And to the vision stretches, as he faints, His feeble hand. Come, Sylph of Summer, come! Return to these green pastures, that, remote From fiery blasts, or deadly blistering frosts, Beneath the temperate atmosphere rejoice! A crown of flame, a javelin in his hand, Like the red arrow that the lightning shoots Through night, impetuous steeds, and burning wheels, That, as they whirl, flash to the cope of heaven, Proclaim the angel of the world of fire! The ocean-king, lord of the waters, rides High on his hissing car, whose concave skirrs The azure deep beneath him, flashing wide, As to the sun the dark-green wave upturns, And foaming far behind: sea-horses breast The bickering surge, with nostrils sounding far, And eyes that flash above the wave, and necks, Whose mane, like breakers whitening in the wind, Toss through the broken foam: he kingly bears His trident sceptre high; around him play Nereids, and sea-maids, singing as he rides Their choral song: huge Triton, weltering on, With scaly train, at times his wreathed shell Sounds, that the caverns of old ocean shake! But milder thou, soft daughter of the air, Sylph of the Summer, come! the silent shower Is past, and 'mid the dripping fern, the wren Peeps, till the sun looks through the clouds again. Oh, come, and breathe thy gentler influence, And send a home-felt quiet to my heart, Soothed as I hear, by fits, thy whisper run, Stirring the tall acacia's pendent leaves, And through yon hazel alley rustling soft Upon the vacant ear! Yon eastern downs, That weather-fence the blossoms of the vale, Where winds from hill to hill the mighty Dike, Of Woden named, with many an antique mound, The warrior's grave, bids exercise awake, And health, the breeze of morning to inhale: Meantime, remote from storms, the myrtle blooms Beneath my southern sash. The hurricane May rend the pines of snowy Labrador, The blasting whirlwinds of the desert sweep The Nubian wilderness—we fear them not; Nor yet, my country, do thy breezes bear, From citrons, or the blooming orange-grove, As in Rousillon's jasmine-bordered vales, Incense at eve. But temperate airs are thine, England; and as thy climate, so thy sons Partake the temper of thine isle; not rude, Nor soft, voluptuous, nor effeminate; Sincere, indeed, and hardy, as becomes Those who can lift their look elate, and say, We strike for injured freedom; and yet mild, And gentle, when the voice of charity Pleads like a voice from heaven: and, thanks to God, The chain that fettered Afric's groaning race, The murderous chain, that, link by link, dropped blood, Is severed; we have lost that foul reproach To all our virtuous boast! Humanity, England, is thine! not that false substitute, That meretricious sadness, which, all sighs For lark or lambkin, yet can hear unmoved The bloodiest orgies of blood-boltered France; Thine is consistent, manly, rational, Nor needing the false glow of sentiment To melt it into sympathy, but mild, And looking with a gentle eye on all; Thy manners open, social, yet refined, Are tempered with reflection; gaiety, In her long-lighted halls, may lead the dance, Or wake the sprightly chord; yet nature, truth, Still warm the ingenuous heart: there is a blush With those most gay, and lovely; and a tear With those most manly! Temperate Liberty Hath yet the fairest altar on thy shores; Such, and so warm with patriot energy, As raised its arm when a false Stuart fled; Yet mingled with deep wisdom's cautious lore, That when it bade a Papal tyrant pause And tremble, held the undeviating reins On the fierce neck of headlong Anarchy. Thy Church, (nor here let zealot bigotry, Vaunting, condemn all altars but its own), Thy Church, majestic, but not sumptuous, Sober, but not austere, with lenity Tempering her fair pre-eminence, sustains Her liberal charities, yet decent state. The tempest is abroad; the fearful sounds Of armament, and gathering tumult, fill The ear of anxious Europe. If, O God! It is thy will, that in the storm of death, When we have lifted the brave sword in vain, We too should sink, sustain us in that hour! Meantime be mine, in cheerful privacy, To wait Thy will, not sanguine, nor depressed; In even course, nor splendid, nor obscure, To steal through life among my villagers! The hum of the discordant crowd, the buzz Of faction, the poor fly that threads the air Self-pleased, the wasp that points its tiny sting Unfelt, pass by me like the idle wind That I regard not; while the Summer Sylph, That whispers through the laurels, wakes the thought Of quietude, and home-felt happiness, And independence, in a land I love! THE HARP OF HOEL. [Part I.] 1 It was a high and holy sight, When Baldwin and his train, With cross and crosier gleaming bright, Came chanting slow the solemn rite, To Gwentland's pleasant plain. 2 High waved before, in crimson pride, The banner of the Cross; The silver rood was then descried, While deacon youths, from side to side, The fuming censer toss. 3 The monks went two and two along, And winding through the glade, Sang, as they passed, a holy song, And harps and citterns, 'mid the throng, A mingled music made. 4 They ceased; when lifting high his hand, The white-robed prelate cried: Arise, arise, at Christ's command, To fight for his name in the Holy Land, Where a Saviour lived and died! 5 With gloves of steel, and good broadsword, And plumed helm of brass, Hoel, Landoga's youthful lord, To hear the father's holy word, Came riding to the pass. 6 More earnestly the prelate spake: Oh, heed no earthly loss! He who will friends and home forsake, Now let him kneel, and fearless take The sign of the Holy Cross. 7 Then many a maid her tresses rent, And did her love implore: Oh, go not thou to banishment! For me, and the pleasant vales of Gwent, Thou never wilt see more. 8 And many a mother, pale with fears, Did kiss her infant son; Said, Who will shield thy helpless years, Who dry thy widowed mother's tears, When thy brave father's gone? 9 God, with firm voice the prelate cried, God will the orphan bless; Sustain the widow's heart, and guide Through the hard world, obscure and wild, The poor and fatherless. 10 Then might you see a shade o'ercast Brave Hoel's ruddy hue, But soon the moment's thought is past:— Hark, hark, 'tis the trumpet's stirring blast! And he grasped his bow of yew. 11 Then might you see a moment's gloom Sit in brave Hoel's eye: Make in the stranger's land my tomb, I follow thee, be it my doom, O Christ, to live or die! 12 No more he thought, though rich in fee, Of any earthly loss, But lighting, on his bended knee, Said, Father, here I take from thee The sign of the Holy Cross. 13 I have a wife, to me more dear Then is my own heart's blood; I have a child, (a starting tear, Which soon he dried, of love sincere, On his stern eyelid stood); 14 To them farewell! O God above, Thine is the fate of war; But oh! reward Gwenlhian's love, And may my son a comfort prove, When I am distant far! 15 Farewell, my harp!—away, away! To the field of death I go; Welcome the trumpet's blast, the neigh Of my bold and barbed steed of gray, And the clang of the steel crossbow! 16 Gwenlhian sat in the hall at night, Counting the heavy hours; She saw the moon, with tranquil light, Shine on the circling mountain's height, And the dim castle towers. 17 Deep stillness was on hill and glen, When she heard a bugle blow; A trump from the watch-tower answered then, And the tramp of steeds, and the voice of men, Were heard in the court below. 18 The watch-dog started at the noise, Then crouched at his master's feet; He knew his step, he heard his voice; But who can now like her rejoice, Who flies her own lord to greet? 19 And soon her arms his neck enfold: But whence that altered mien! O say, then, is thy love grown cold, Or hast thou been hurt by the robbers bold, That won in the forest of Dean? 20 Oh no, he cried, the God above, Who all my soul can see, Knows my sincere, my fervent love; If aught my stern resolve could move, It were one tear from thee. 21 But I have sworn, in the Holy Land,— Need I the sequel speak; Too well, she cried, I understand! Then grasped in agony his hand, And hid her face on his cheek. 22 My loved Gwenlhian, weep not so, From the lid that tear I kiss; Though to the wars far off I go, Betide me weal, betide me woe, We yet may meet in bliss. 23 Fourteen suns their course had rolled, When firmly thus he spake; Hear now my last request: behold This ring, it is of purest gold, Love, keep it for my sake! 24 When summers seven have robed each tree, And clothed the vales with green, If I come not back, then thou art free, To wed or not, and to think of me, As I had never been! 25 Nay, answer not,—what wouldst thou say! Come, let my harp be brought; For the last time, I fain would play, Ere yet we part, our favourite lay, And cheat severer thought:THE AIR. Oh, cast every care to the wind, And dry, best beloved, the tear! Secure, that thou ever shalt find, The friend of thy bosom sincere. Still friendship shall live in the breast of the brave, And we'll love, the long day, where the forest-trees wave. I have felt each emotion of bliss, That affection the fondest can prove, Have received on my lip the first kiss Of thy holy and innocent love; But perish each hope of delight, Like the flashes of night on the sea, If ever, though far from thy sight, My soul is forgetful of thee! Still the memory shall live in the breast of the brave, How we loved, the long day, where the forest-trees wave. 26 Now bring my boy; may God above Shower blessings on his head! May he requite his mother's love, And to her age a comfort prove, When I perhaps am dead! 27 The beams of morn on his helm did play, And aloud the bugle blew, Then he leaped on his harnessed steed of gray, And sighed to the winds as he gallopped away, Adieu, my heart's love, adieu! 28 And now he has joined the warrior train Of knights and barons bold, That, bound to Salem's holy plain, Across the gently-swelling main, Their course exulting hold. 29 With a cross of gold, as on they passed, The crimson streamers flew; The shields hung glittering round the mast, And on the waves a radiance cast, Whilst all the trumpets blew. 30 O'er the Severn-surge, in long array, So, the proud galleys went, Till soon, as dissolved in ether gray, The woods, and the shores, and the Holms steal away, And the long blue hills of Gwent. Part II. 1 High on the hill, with moss o'ergrown, A hermit chapel stood; It spoke the tale of seasons gone, And half-revealed its ivied stone, Amid the beechen wood. 2 Here often, when the mountain trees A leafy murmur made, Now still, now swaying to the breeze, (Sounds that the musing fancy please), The widowed mourner strayed. 3 And many a morn she climbed the steep, From whence she might behold, Where, 'neath the clouds, in shining sweep, And mingling with the mighty deep, The sea-broad Severn rolled. 4 Her little boy beside her played, With sea-shells in his hand; And sometimes, 'mid the bents delayed, And sometimes running onward, said, Oh, where is Holy Land! 5 My child, she cried, my prattler dear! And kissed his light-brown hair; Her eyelid glistened with a tear, And none but God above could hear, That hour, her secret prayer. 6 As thus she nursed her secret woes, Oft to the wind and rain She listened, at sad autumn's close, Whilst many a thronging shadow rose, Dark-glancing o'er her brain. 7 Now lonely to the cloudy height Of the steep hill she strays; Below, the raven wings his flight, And often on the screaming kite She sees the wild deer gaze. 8 The clouds were gathered on its brow, The warring winds were high; She heard a hollow voice, and now She lifts to heaven a secret vow, Whilst the king of the storm rides by. 9 Seated on a craggy rock, What aged man appears! There is no hind, no straggling flock; Comes the strange shade my thoughts to mock, And shake my soul with fears? 10 Fast drive the hurrying clouds of morn; A pale man stands confessed; With look majestic, though forlorn, A mirror in his hand, and horn Of ivory on his breast. 11 Daughter of grief, he gently said, And beckoned her: come near; Now say, what would you give to me, If you brave Hoel's form might see, Or the sound of his bugle hear! 12 Hoel, my love, where'er thou art, All England I would give, If, never, never more to part, I now could hold thee to my heart, For whom alone I live! 13 He placed the white horn to her ear, And sudden a sweet voice Stole gently, as of fairies near, While accents soft she seemed to hear, Daughter of grief, rejoice! 14 For soon to love and thee I fly, From Salem's hallowed plain! The mirror caught her turning eye, As pale in death she saw him lie, And sinking 'mid the slain. 15 She turned to the strange phantom-man, But she only saw the sky, And the clouds on the lonely mountains' van, And the Clydden-Shoots, that rushing ran, To meet the waves of Wye. 16 Thus seven long years had passed away,— She heard no voice of mirth; No minstrel raised his festive lay, At the sad close of the drisly day, Beside the blazing hearth. 17 She seemed in sorrow, yet serene, No tear was on her face; And lighting oft her pensive mien, Upon her languid look was seen A meek attractive grace. 18 In beauty's train she yet might vie, For though in mourning weeds, No friar, I deem, that passed her by, Ere saw her dark, yet gentle eye, But straight forgot his beads. 19 Eineon, generous and good, Alone with friendship's aid, Eineon, of princely Rhys's blood, Who 'mid the bravest archers stood, To sooth her griefs essayed. 20 He had himself been early tried By stern misfortune's doom; For she who loved him drooped and died, And on the green hill's flowery side He raised her grassy tomb. 21 What marvel, in his lonely heart, To faith a friendship true, If, when her griefs she did impart, And tears of memory oft would start, If more than pity grew. 22 With converse mild he oft would seek To sooth her sense of care; As the west wind, with breathings weak, Wakes, on the hectic's faded cheek A smile of faint despair. 23 The summer's eve was calm and still, When once his harp he strung; Soft as the twilight on the hill, Affection seemed his heart to fill, Whilst eloquent he sung: When Fortune to all thy warm hopes was unkind, And the morn of thy youth was o'erclouded with woe, In me, not a stranger to grief, thou should'st find, All that friendship and kindness and truth could bestow. Yes, the time it has been, when my soul was oppressed, But no longer this heart would for heaviness pine, Could I lighten the load of an innocent breast, And steal but a moment of sadness from thine. 24 He paused, then with a starting tear, And trembling accent, cried, O lady, hide that look severe,— The voice of love, of friendship hear, And be again a bride. 25 Mourn not thy much-loved Hoel lost,— Lady, he is dead, is dead,— Far distant wanders his pale ghost,— His bones by the white surge are tossed, And the wave rolls o'er his head. 26 She said, Sev'n years their course have rolled, Since thus brave Hoel spake, When last I heard his voice, Behold, This ring,—it is of purest gold,— Then, keep it for my sake. 27 When summers seven have robed each tree, And decked the coombs with green, If I come not back, then thou art free, To wed or not, and to think of me As I had never been. 28 Those seven sad summers now are o'er, And three I yet demand; If in that space I see no more The friend I ever must deplore, Then take a mourner's hand. 29 The time is passed:—the laugh, the lay, The nuptial feast proclaim; From many a rushing torrent gray, From many a wild brook's wandering way, The hoary minstrels came. 30 From Kymin's crag, with fragments strewed; From Skirid, bleak and high; From Penalt's shaggy solitude; From Wyndcliff, desolate and rude, That frowns o'er mazy Wye. 31 With harps the gallery glittered bright,— The pealing rafters rung; Far off upon the woods of night, From the tall window's arch, the light Of tapers clear was flung. 32 The harpers ceased the acclaiming lay, When, with descending beard, Scallop, and staff his steps to stay, As, foot-sore, on his weary way, A pilgrim wan appeared. 33 Now lend me a harp for St Mary's sake, For my skill I fain would try, A poor man's offering to make, If haply still my hand may wake Some pleasant melody. 34 With scoffs the minstrel crowd replied, Dost thou a harp request! And loud in mirth, and swelled with pride, Some his rain-dripping hair deride, And some his sordid vest. 35 Pilgrim, a harp shall soon be found, Young Hoel instant cried; There lies a harp upon the ground, And none hath ever heard its sound, Since my brave father died. 36 The harp is brought: upon the frame A filmy cobweb hung; The strings were few, yet 'twas the same; The old man drawing near the flame, The chords imperfect rung: Oh! cast every care to the wind, And dry, best beloved, the tear; Secure that thou ever shalt find The friend of thy bosom sincere. 37 She speechless gazed:—he stands confessed,— The dark eyes of her Hoel shine; Her heart has forgotten it e'er was oppressed, And she murmurs aloud, as she sinks on his breast, Oh! press my heart to thine. 38 He turned his look a little space, To hide the tears of joy; Then rushing, with a warm embrace, Cried, as he kissed young Hoel's face, My boy, my heart-loved boy! 39 Proud harpers, strike a louder lay,— No more forlorn I bend! Prince Eineon, with the rest, be gay, Though fate hath torn a bride away, Accept a long-lost friend. This tale I heard, when at the close of day The village harper tuned an ancient lay; He struck his harp, beneath a ruin hoar, And sung of love and truth, in days of yore, And I retained the song, with counsel sage, To teach one lesson to a wiser age! AVENUE IN SAVERNAKE FOREST. How soothing sound the gentle airs that move The innumerable leaves, high overhead, When autumn first, from the long avenue, That lifts its arching height of ancient shade, Steals here and there a leaf! Within the gloom, In partial sunshine white, some trunks appear, Studding the glens of fern; in solemn shade Some mingle their dark branches, but yet all, All make a sad sweet music, as they move, Not undelightful to a stranger's heart. They seem to say, in accents audible, Farewell to summer, and farewell the strains Of many a lithe and feathered chorister, That through the depth of these incumbent woods Made the long summer gladsome. I have heard To the deep-mingling sounds of organs clear, (When slow the choral anthem rose beneath), The glimmering minster, through its pillared aisles, Echo;—but not more sweet the vaulted roof Rang to those linked harmonies, than here The high wood answers to the lightest breath Of nature. Oh, may such sweet music steal, Soothing the cares of venerable age, From public toil retired: may it awake, As, still and slow, the sun of life declines, Remembrances, not mournful, but most sweet; May it, as oft beneath the sylvan shade Their honoured owner strays, come like the sound Of distant seraph harps, yet speaking clear! How poor is every sound of earthly things, When heaven's own music waits the just and pure! DIRGE OF NELSON. Toll Nelson's knell! a soul more brave Ne'er triumphed on the green-sea wave! Sad o'er the hero's honoured grave, Toll Nelson's knell! The ball of Death unerring flew; His cheek has lost its ardent hue; He sinks, amid his gallant crew! Toll Nelson's knell! Yet lift, brave chief, thy dying eyes; Hark! loud huzzas around thee rise; Aloft the flag of conquest flies! The day is won! The day is won—peace to the brave! But whilst the joyous streamers wave, We'll think upon the victor's grave! Peace to the brave! DEATH OF CAPTAIN COOKE, OF “THE BELLEROPHON,” KILLED IN THE SAME BATTLE. When anxious Spain, along her rocky shore, From cliff to cliff returned the sea-fight's roar; When flash succeeding flash, tremendous broke The haze incumbent, and the clouds of smoke, As oft the volume rolled away, thy mien, Thine eye, serenely terrible, was seen, My gallant friend.—Hark! the shrill bugle calls, Is the day won! alas, he falls—he falls! His soul from pain, from agony release! Hear his last murmur, Let me die in peace! Yet still, brave Cooke, thy country's grateful tear, Shall wet the bleeding laurel on thy bier. But who shall wake to joy, through a long life Of sadness, thy beloved and widowed wife, Who now, perhaps, thinks how the green seas foam, That bear thy victor ship impatient home! Alas! the well-known views,—the swelling plain, Thy laurel-circled home, endeared in vain, The brook, the church, those chestnuts darkly-green, Yon fir-crowned summit, and the village scene, Wardour's long sweep of woods, the nearer mill, And high o'er all, the turrets of Font Hill: These views, when summer comes, shall charm no more Him o'er whose welt'ring corse the wild waves roar, Enough: 'twas Honour's voice that awful cried, Glory to him who for his country died! Yet dreary is her solitude who bends And mourns the best of husbands, fathers, friends! Oh! when she wakes at midnight, but to shed Fresh tears of anguish on her lonely bed, Thinking on him who is not; then restrain The tear, O God, and her sad heart sustain! Giver of life, may she remember still Thy chastening hand, and to thy sovereign will Bow silently; not hopeless, while her eye She raises to a bright futurity, And meekly trusts, in heaven, Thou wilt restore That happiness the world can give no more! BATTLE OF CORRUNA. The tide of fate rolls on!—heart-pierced and pale, The gallant soldier lies, nor aught avail, The shield, the sword, the spirit of the brave, From rapine's armed hand thy vales to save, Land of illustrious heroes, who, of yore, Drenched the same plains with the invader's gore, Stood frowning, in the front of death, and hurled Defiance to the conquerors of the world! Oh, when we hear the agonising tale Of those who, faint, and fugitive, and pale, Saw hourly, harassed through their long retreat, Some worn companion sinking at their feet, Yet even in danger and from toil more bold, Back on their gathering foes the tide of battle rolled;— While tears of pity mingle with applause, On the dread scene in silence let us pause; Yes, pause, and ask, Is not thy awful hand Stretched out, O God, o'er a devoted land, Whose vales of beauty Nature spread in vain, Where misery moaned on the uncultured plain, Where Bigotry went by with jealous scowl, Where Superstition muttered in his cowl; Whilst o'er the Inquisition's dismal holds, Its horrid banner waved in bleeding folds! And dost thou thus, Lord of all might, fulfil With wreck and tempests thy eternal will, Shatter the arms in which weak kingdoms trust, And strew their scattered ensigns in the dust? Oh, if no human wisdom may withstand The terrors, Lord, of thy uplifted hand; If the dark tide no prowess can control, Yet nearer, charged with dread commission, roll; Still may my country's ark majestic ride, Though sole, yet safe, on the conflicting tide; Till hushed be the wild rocking of the blast, And the red storm of death be overpast! SKETCH FROM BOWDEN HILL AFTER SICKNESS. How cheering are thy prospects, airy hill, To him who, pale and languid, on thy brow Pauses, respiring, and bids hail again The upland breeze, the comfortable sun, And all the landscape's hues! Upon the point Of the descending steep I stand. How rich, How mantling in the gay and gorgeous tints Of summer! far beneath me, sweeping on, From field to field, from vale to cultured vale, The prospect spreads its crowded beauties wide! Long lines of sunshine, and of shadow, streak The farthest distance; where the passing light Alternate falls, 'mid the undistinguished trees, White dots of gleamy domes, and peeping towers, As from the painter's instant touch, appear. As thus the eye ranges from hill to hill, Here white with passing sunshine, there with trees Innumerable shaded, clustering more, As the long vale retires, the ample scene, Warm with new grace and beauty, seems to live. Lives! all is animation! beauty! hope! Snatched from the dark and dreamless grave, so late, Shall I pass silent, now first issuing forth, To feel again thy fragrance, to respire Thy breath, to hail thy look, thy living look, O Nature! Let me the deep joy contrast, Which now the inmost heart like music fills, With the sick chamber's sorrows, oft from morn, Silent, till lingering eve, save when the sound Of whispers steal, and bodings breathed more low, As friends approach the pillow: so awaked From deadly trance, the sick man lifts his eyes, Then in despondence closes them on all, All earth's fond wishes! Oh, how changed are now His thoughts! he sees rich nature glowing round, He feels her influence! languid with delight, And whilst his eye is filled with transient fire, He almost thinks he hears her gently say, Live, live! O Nature, thee, in the soft winds, Thee, in the soothing sound of summer leaves, When the still earth lies sultry; thee, methinks, Ev'n now I hear bid welcome to thy vales And woods again! And I will welcome them, And pour, as erst, the song of heartfelt praise. From yonder line, where fade the farthest hills Which bound the blue lap of the swelling vale, On whose last line, seen like a beacon, hangs Thy tower, benevolent, accomplished Hoare, To where I stand, how wide the interval! Yet instantaneous, to the hurrying eye Displayed; though peeping towers and villages Thick scattered, 'mid the intermingling elms, And towns remotely marked by hovering smoke, And grass-green pastures with their herds, and seats Of rural beauty, cottages and farms, Unnumbered as the hedgerows, lie between! Roaming at large to where the gray sky bends, The eye scarce knows to rest, till back recalled By yonder ivied cloisters in the plain, Whose turret, peeping pale above the shade, Smiles in the venerable grace of years. As the few threads of age's silver hairs, Just sprinkled o'er the forehead, lend a grace Of saintly reverence, seemly, though compared With blooming Mary's tresses like the morn; So the gray weather-stained towers yet wear A secret charm impressive, though opposed To views in verdure flourishing, the woods, And scenes of Attic taste, that glitter near. O venerable pile, though now no more The pensive passenger, at evening, hears The slowly-chanted vesper; or the sounds Of “Miserere,” die along the vale; Yet piety and honoured age retired, There hold their blameless sojourn, ere the bowl Be broken, or the silver chord be loosed. Nor can I pass, snatched from untimely fate, Without a secret prayer, that so my age, When many a circling season has declined, In charity and peace may wait its close. Yet still be with me, O delightful friend, Soothing companion of my vacant hours, Oh, still be with me, Spirit of the Muse! Not to subdue, or hold in moody spell, The erring senses, but to animate And warm my heart, where'er the prospect smiles, With Nature's fairest views; not to display Vain ostentations of a poet's art, But silent, and associate of my joys Or sorrows, to infuse a tenderness, A thought, that seems to mingle, as I gaze, With all the works of God. So cheer my path, From youth to sober manhood, till the light Of evening smile upon the fading scene. And though no pealing clarion swell my fame, When all my days are gone; let me not pass, Like the forgotten clouds of yesterday, Nor unremembered by the fatherless Of the loved village where my bones are laid. SUN-DIAL, IN THE CHURCHYARD OF BREMHILL. So passes silent o'er the dead thy shade, Brief Time; and hour by hour, and day by day, The pleasing pictures of the present fade, And like a summer vapour steal away! And have not they, who here forgotten lie (Say, hoary chronicler of ages past!) Once marked thy shadow with delighted eye, Nor thought it fled, how certain, and how fast! Since thou hast stood, and thus thy vigil kept, Noting each hour, o'er mouldering stones beneath; The pastor and his flock alike have slept, And dust to dust proclaimed the stride of death. Another race succeeds, and counts the hour, Careless alike; the hour still seems to smile, As hope, and youth, and life, were in our power; So smiling and so perishing the while. I heard the village bells, with gladsome sound, When to these scenes a stranger I drew near, Proclaim the tidings to the village round, While memory wept upon the good man's bier. Even so, when I am dead, shall the same bells Ring merrily, when my brief days are gone; While still the lapse of time thy shadow tells, And strangers gaze upon my humble stone! Enough, if we may wait in calm content, The hour that bears us to the silent sod; Blameless improve the time that heaven has lent, And leave the issue to thy will, O God! THE SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY BY SEA: A DESCRIPTIVE AND HISTORICAL POEM. BOOK THE FIRST. BOOK THE FIRST. The book opens with the resting of the Ark on the mountains of the great Indian Caucasus, considered by many authors as Ararat: the present state of the inhabited world, contrasted with its melancholy appearance immediately after the flood. The poem returns to the situation of our forefathers on leaving the ark; beautiful evening described. The Angel of Destruction appears to Noah in a dream, and informs him that although he and his family alone have escaped, the very Ark, which was the means of his present preservation, shall be the cause of the future triumph of Destruction. In his dream, the evils in consequence of the discovery of America, the slave-trade, et cet., are set before him. Noah, waking from disturbed sleep, ascends the summit of Caucasus. An angel appears to him; tells him that the revelations in his dream were permitted by the Almighty; that he is commissioned to explain everything; he presents to his view the shadow of the world as it exists; regions are pointed out; the dispersion of mankind; the rise of superstition; the birth of a Saviour, and the triumph of Charity: that navigation shall be the means of extending the knowledge of God over the globe; and though some evils must take place, happiness and love shall finally prevail upon the earth. Awake a louder and a loftier strain! Beloved harp, whose tones have oft beguiled My solitary sorrows, when I left The scene of happier hours, and wandered far, A pale and drooping stranger; I have sat (While evening listened to the convent bell) On the wild margin of the Rhine, and wooed Thy sympathies, “a-weary of the world,” And I have found with thee sad fellowship, Yet always sweet, whene'er my languid hand Passed carelessly o'er the responsive wires, While unambitious of the laurelled meed That crowns the gifted bard, I only asked Some stealing melodies the heart might love, And a brief sonnet to beguile my tears! But I had hope that one day I might wake Thy strings to loftier utterance; and now, Bidding adieu to glens, and woods, and streams, And turning where, magnificent and vast, Main Ocean bursts upon my sight, I strike,— Rapt in the theme on which I long have mused,— Strike the loud lyre, and as the blue waves rock, Swell to their solemn roar the deepening chords. Lift thy indignant billows high, proclaim Thy terrors, Spirit of the hoary seas! I sing thy dread dominion, amid wrecks, And storms, and howling solitudes, to Man Submitted: awful shade of Camoens Bend from the clouds of heaven. By the bold tones Of minstrelsy, that o'er the unknown surge (Where never daring sail before was spread) Echoed, and startled from his long repose The indignant Phantom of the stormy Cape; Oh, let me think that in the winds I hear Thy animating tones, whilst I pursue With ardent hopes, like thee, my venturous way, And bid the seas resound my song! And thou, Father of Albion's streams, majestic Thames, Amid the glittering scene, whose long-drawn wave Goes noiseless, yet with conscious pride, beneath The thronging vessels' shadows; nor through scenes More fair, the yellow Tagus, or the Nile, That ancient river, winds. Thou to the strain Shalt haply listen, that records the might Of Ocean, like a giant at thy feet Vanquished, and yielding to thy gentle state The ancient sceptre of his dread domain! All was one waste of waves, that buried deep Earth and its multitudes: the Ark alone, High on the cloudy van of Ararat, Rested; for now the death-commissioned storm Sinks silent, and the eye of day looks out Dim through the haze; while short successive gleams Flit o'er the weltering Deluge as it shrinks, Or the transparent rain-drops, falling few, Distinct and larger glisten. So the Ark Rests upon Ararat; but nought around Its inmates can behold, save o'er th' expanse Of boundless waters, the sun's orient orb Stretching the hull's long shadow, or the moon In silence, through the silver-cinctured clouds, Sailing as she herself were lost, and left In Nature's loneliness! But oh, sweet Hope, Thou bid'st a tear of holy ecstasy Start to their eye-lids, when at night the Dove, Weary, returns, and lo! an olive leaf Wet in her bill: again she is put forth, When the seventh morn shines on the hoar abyss:— Due evening comes: her wings are heard no more! The dawn awakes, not cold and dripping sad, But cheered with lovelier sunshine; far away The dark-red mountains slow their naked peaks Upheave above the waste; Imaus gleams; Fume the huge torrents on his desert sides; Till at the awful voice of Him who rules The storm, the ancient Father and his train On the dry land descend. Here let us pause. No noise in the vast circuit of the globe Is heard; no sound of human stirring: none Of pasturing herds, or wandering flocks; nor song Of birds that solace the forsaken woods From morn till eve; save in that spot that holds The sacred Ark: there the glad sounds ascend, And Nature listens to the breath of Life. The fleet horse bounds, high-neighing to the wind That lifts his streaming mane; the heifer lows; Loud sings the lark amid the rainbow's hues; The lion lifts him muttering; Man comes forth— He kneels upon the earth—he kisses it; And to the God who stretched that radiant bow, He lifts his trembling transports. From one spot Alone of earth such sounds ascend. How changed The human prospect! when from realm to realm, From shore to shore, from isle to furthest isle, Flung to the stormy main, man's murmuring race, Various and countless as the shells that strew The ocean's winding marge, are spread; from shores Sinensian, where the passing proas gleam Innumerous 'mid the floating villages: To Acapulco west, where laden deep With gold and gems rolls the superb galleon, Shadowing the hoar Pacific: from the North, Where on some snowy promontory's height The Lapland wizard beats his drum, and calls The spirits of the winds, to th' utmost South, Where savage Fuego shoots its cold white peaks, Dreariest of lands, and the poor Pecherais Shiver and moan along its waste of snows. So stirs the earth; and for the Ark that passed Alone and darkling o'er the dread abyss, Ten thousand and ten thousand barks are seen Fervent and glancing on the friths and sounds; From the Bermudian that, with masts inclined, Shoots like a dart along; to the tall ship That, like a stately swan, in conscious pride Breasts beautiful the rising surge, and throws The gathered waters back, and seems to move A living thing, along her lucid way Streaming in white-winged glory to the sun! Some waft the treasures of the east; some bear Their country's dark artillery o'er the surge Frowning; some in the southern solitudes, Bound on discovery of new regions, spread, 'Mid rocks of driving ice, that crash around, Their weather-beaten mainsail; or explore Their perilous way from isle to isle, and wind The tender social tie; connecting man, Wherever scattered, with his fellow-man. How many ages rolled away ere thus, From Nature's general wreck, the world's great scene Was tenanted! See from their sad abode, At Heaven's dread voice, heard from the solitude, As in the dayspring of created things, The sad survivors of a buried world Come forth; on them, though desolate their seat, The sky looks down with smiles; for the broad sun, That to the west slopes his untired career, Hangs o'er the water's brim. The aged sire, Now rising from his evening sacrifice, Amid his offspring stands, and lifts his eyes, Moist with a tear, to the bright bow: the fire Yet on the altar burns, whose trailing fume Goes slowly up, and marks the lucid cope Of the soft sky, where distant clouds hang still And beautiful. So placid Evening steals After the lurid storm, like a sweet form Of fairy following a perturbed shape Of giant terror, that in darkness strode. Slow sinks the lord of day; the clustering clouds More ardent burn; confusion of rich hues, Crimson, and gold, and purple, bright, inlay Their varied edges; till before the eye, As their last lustre fades, small silver stars Succeed; and twinkling each in its own sphere, Thick as the frost's unnumbered spangles, strew The slowly-paling heavens. Tired Nature seems Like one who, struggling long for life, had beat The billows, and scarce gained a desert crag, O'er-spent, to sink to rest: the tranquil airs Whisper repose. Now sunk in sleep reclines The Father of the world; then the sole moon Mounts high in shadowy beauty; every cloud Retires, as in the blue space she moves on Amid the fulgent orbs supreme, and looks The queen of heaven and earth. Stilly the streams Retiring sound; midnight's high hollow vault Faint echoes; stilly sound the distant streams. When, hark! a strange and mingled wail, and cries As of ten thousand thousand perishing! A phantom, 'mid the shadows of the dead, Before the holy Patriarch, as he slept, Stood terrible:—Dark as a storm it stood Of thunder and of winds, like hollow seas Remote; meantime a voice was heard: Behold, Noah, the foe of thy weak race! my name Destruction, whom thy sons in yonder plains Shall worship, and all grim, with mooned horns Paint fabling: when the flood from off the earth Before it swept the living multitudes, I rode amid the hurricane; I heard The universal shriek of all that lived. In vain they climbed the rocky heights: I struck The adamantine mountains, and like dust They crumbled in the billowy foam. My hall, Deep in the centre of the seas, received The victims as they sank! Then, with dark joy, I sat amid ten thousand carcases, That weltered at my feet! But thou and thine Have braved my utmost fury: what remains But vengeance, vengeance on thy hated race;— And be that sheltering shrine the instrument! Thence, taught to stem the wild sea when it roars, In after-times to lands remote, where roamed The naked man and his wan progeny, They, more instructed in the fatal use Of arts and arms, shall ply their way; and thou Wouldst bid the great deep cover thee to see The sorrows of thy miserable sons: But turn, and view in part the truths I speak. He said, and vanished with a dismal sound Of lamentation from his grisly troop. Then saw the just man in his dream what seemed A new and savage land: huge forests stretched Their world of wood, shading like night the banks Of torrent-foaming rivers, many a league Wandering and lost in solitudes; green isles Here shone, and scattered huts beneath the shade Of branching palms were seen; whilst in the sun A naked infant playing, stretched his hand To reach a speckled snake, that through the leaves Oft darted, or its shining volumes rolled Erratic. From the woods a sable man Came, as from hunting; in his arms he took The smiling child, that with the feathers played Which nodded on his brow; the sheltering hut Received them, and the cheerful smoke went up Above the silent woods. Anon was heard The sound as of strange thunder, from the mouths Of hollow engines, as, with white sails spread, Tall vessels, hulled like the great Ark, approached The verdant shores: they, in a woody cove Safe-stationed, hang their pennants motionless Beneath the palms. Meantime, with shouts and song, The boat rows hurrying to the land; nor long Ere the great sea for many a league is tinged, While corpse on corpse, down the red torrent rolled, Floats, and the inmost forests murmur—Blood. Now vast savannahs meet the view, where high Above the arid grass the serpent lifts His tawny crest:—Not far a vessel rides Upon the sunny main, and to the shore Black savage tribes a mournful captive urge, Who looks to heaven with anguish. Him they cast Bound in the rank hold of the prison-ship, With many a sad associate in despair, Each panting chained to his allotted space; And moaning, whilst their wasted eye-balls roll. Another scene appears: the naked slave Writhes to the bloody lash; but more to view Nature forbad, for starting from his dream The just Man woke. Shuddering he gazed around; He saw the earliest beam of morning shine Slant on the hills without; he heard the breath Of placid kine, but troubled thoughts and sad Arose. He wandered forth; and now far on, By heavy musings led, reached a ravine Most mild amid the tempest-riven rocks, Through whose dark pass he saw the flood remote Gray-spreading, while the mists of morn went up. He paused; when on his lonely pathway flashed A light, and sounds as of approaching wings Instant were heard. A radiant form appeared, Celestial, and with heavenly accent said: Noah, I come commissioned from above, Where angels move before th' eternal throne Of heaven's great King in glory, to dispel The mists of darkness from thy sight; for know, Not unpermitted of th' Eternal One The shadows of thy melancholy dream Hung o'er thee slumbering: Mine the task to show Futurity's faint scene;—now follow me. He said; and up to the unclouded height Of that great Eastern mountain, that surveys Dim Asia, they ascended. Then his brow The Angel touched, and cleared with whispered charm The mortal mist before his eyes.—At once (As in the skiey mirage, when the seer From lonely Kilda's western summit sees A wondrous scene in shadowy vision rise) The nether world, with seas and shores, appeared Submitted to his view: but not as then, A melancholy waste, deform and sad; But fair as now the green earth spreads, with woods, Champaign, and hills, and many winding streams Robed, the magnificent illusion rose. He saw in mazy longitude devolved The mighty Brahma-Pooter; to the East Thibet and China, and the shining sea That sweeps the inlets of Japan, and winds Amid the Curile and Aleutian isles, Pale to the north. Siberia's snowy scenes Are spread; Jenisca and the freezing Ob Appear, and many a forest's shady track Far as the Baltic, and the utmost bounds Of Scandinavia; thence the eye returns: And lo! great Lebanon—abrupt and dark With pines, and airy Carmel, rising slow Above the midland main, where hang the capes Of Italy and Greece; swart Africa, Beneath the parching sun, her long domain Reveals, the mountains of the Moon, the source Of Nile, the wild mysterious Niger, lost Amid the torrid sands; and to the south Her stormy cape. Beyond the misty main The weary eye scarce wanders, when behold Plata, through vaster territory poured; And Andes, sweeping the horizon's tract, Mightiest of mountains! whose eternal snows Feel not the nearer sun; whose umbrage chills The murmuring ocean; whose volcanic fires A thousand nations view, hung like the moon High in the middle waste of heaven; thy range, Shading far off the Southern hemisphere, A dusky file Titanic. So spread Before our great forefather's view the globe Appeared; with seas, and shady continents, And verdant isles, and mountains lifting dark Their forests, and indenting rivers, poured In silvery maze. And, Lo! the Angel said, These scenes, O Noah, thy posterity Shall people; but remote and scattered wide, They shall forget their God, and see no trace, Save dimly, of their Great Original. Rude caves shall be their dwellings: till, with noise Of multitudes, imperial cities rise. But the Arch Fiend, the foe of God and man, Shall fling his spells; and, 'mid illusions drear, Blear Superstition shall arise, the earth Eclipsing.—Deep in caves, vault within vault Far winding; or in night of thickest woods, Where no bird sings; or 'mid huge circles gray Of uncouth stone, her aspect wild, and pale As the terrific flame that near her burns, She her mysterious rites, 'mid hymns and cries, Shall wake, and to her shapeless idols, vast And smeared with blood, or shrines of lust, shall lead Her votaries, maddening as she waves her torch, With visage more expanded, to the groans Of human sacrifice. Nor think that love And happiness shall dwell in vales remote: The naked man shall see the glorious sun, And think it but enlightens his poor isle, Hid in the watery waste; cold on his limbs The ocean-spray shall beat; his Deities Shall be the stars, the thunder, and the winds; And if a stranger on his rugged shores Be cast, his offered blood shall stain the strand. O wretched man! who then shall raise thee up From this thy dark estate, forlorn and lost? The Patriarch said. The Angel answered mild, His God, who destined him to noblest ends! But mutual intercourse shall stir at first The sunk and grovelling spirit, and from sleep The sullen energies of man rouse up, As of a slumbering giant. He shall walk Sublime amid the works of God: the earth Shall own his wide dominion; the great sea Shall toss in vain its roaring waves; his eye Shall scan the bright orbs as they roll above Glorious, and his expanding heart shall burn, As wide and wider in magnificence The vast scene opens; in the winds and clouds, The seas, and circling planets, he shall see The shadow of a dread Almighty move. Then shall the Dayspring rise, before whose beam The darkness of the world is past:—For, hark! Seraphs and angel-choirs with symphonies Acclaiming of ten thousand golden harps, Amid the bursting clouds of heaven revealed, At once, in glory jubilant, they sing— God the Redeemer liveth! He who took Man's nature on him, and in human shroud Veiled his immortal glory! He is risen! God the Redeemer liveth! And behold! The gates of life and immortality Open to all that breathe! Oh, might the strains But win the world to love; meek Charity Should lift her looks and smile; and with faint voice The weary pilgrim of the earth exclaim, As close his eye-lids—Death, where is thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory? And ye, Whom ocean's melancholy wastes divide, Who slumber to the sullen surge, awake, Break forth into thanksgiving, for the bark That rolled upon the desert deep, shall bear The tidings of great joy to all that live, Tidings of life and light. Oh, were those men, (The Patriarch raised his drooping looks, and said) Such in my dream I saw, who to the isles And peaceful sylvan scenes o'er the wide seas Came tilting; then their murderous instruments Lifted, that flashed to the indignant sun, Whilst the poor native died:—Oh, were those men Instructed in the laws of holier love, Thou hast displayed? The Angel meek replied— Call rather fiends of hell those who abuse The mercies they receive: that such, indeed, On whom the light of clearer knowledge beams, Should wander forth, and for the tender voice Of charity should scatter crimes and woe, And drench, where'er they pass, the earth with blood, Might make ev'n angels weep: But the poor tribes That groaned and died, deem not them innocent As injured; more ensanguined rites and deeds Of deepest stain were theirs; and what if God, So to approve his justice, and exact Most even retribution, blood for blood, Bid forth the Angel of the storm of death! Thou saw'st, indeed, the seeming innocence Of man the savage; but thou saw'st not all. Behold the scene more near! hear the shrill whoop Of murderous war! See tribes on neighbour tribes Rush howling, their red hatchets wielding high, And shouting to their barbarous gods! Behold The captive bound, yet vaunting direst hate, And mocking his tormentors, while they gash His flesh unshrinking, tear his eyeballs, burn His beating breast! Hear the dark temples ring To groans and hymns of murderous sacrifice; While the stern priest, the rites of horror done, With hollow-echoing chaunt lifts up the heart Of the last victim 'mid the yelling throng, Quivering, and red, and reeking to the sun! Reclaimed by gradual intercourse, his heart Warmed with new sympathies, the forest-chief Shall cast the bleeding hatchet to his gods Of darkness, and one Lord of all adore— Maker of heaven and earth. Let it suffice, He hath permitted evil for a while To mingle its deep hues and sable shades Amid life's fair perspective, as thou saw'st Of late the blackening clouds; but in the end All these shall roll away, and evening still Come smilingly, while the great sun looks down On the illumined scene. So Charity Shall smile on all the earth, and Nature's God Look down upon his works; and while far off The shrieking night-fiends fly, one voice shall rise From shore to shore, from isle to furthest isle— Glory to God on high, and on earth peace, Peace and good-will to men! Thou rest in hope, And Him with meekness and with trust adore! He said, and spreading bright his ampler wing, Flew to the heaven of heavens; the meek man bowed Adoring, and, with pensive thoughts resigned, Bent from the aching height his lonely way. BOOK THE SECOND. BOOK THE SECOND Commences with an ardent wish, that as our forefather viewed the world clearly displayed before him in a vision, so we of these late days might be able, through the clouds of time, to look back upon the early ages of the globe; we might then see, in their splendour, Thebes, Edom, et cet.; but the early history of mankind is obscure, the only certain light is from the sacred writings. By these we are informed of the dispersion of earth's first inhabitants, after the flood. The descendants of Ham, after this dispersion, according to Bruce, having first gained the summits of the Ethiopian mountains, there form subterraneous abodes. In process of time they descend, people Egypt, built Thebes; obscure tradition of the Ark; first make voyages. Ophir is not long afterwards discovered. This Bruce places, on most respectable authority, at Sofala; I have ventured to place it otherwhere, but still admitting one general idea, that when the way to it overland was attended with difficulties, an easier course was at last opened by sea. As to Ammon's exploits, I must shelter myself under the authority of Sir Isaac Newton. After a sacrifice by the Egyptians, the monsoon sets in. The ships follow its direction, as the mariners imagine a god leads them. Hence the discovery of so much of the world by sea. Reflection on commerce. The voyage of Solomon. A description of the glory of Tyre, the most commercial mart of the early world. Tyrian discoveries in the Mediterranean; voyages to the coast of Italy and Spain, to the Straits, and from thence to Britain. Tyre is destroyed, and the thought naturally arises, that Britain, which, at the time of the splendour of the maritime Tyrians, was an obscure island, is now at the summit of maritime renown; while Tyre is a place where only “the fisherman dries his net.” This leads to an eulogium on England; and the book concludes with the triumphs of her fleets and armies on that very shore, on which science, and art, and commerce, and maritime renown, first arose. This digression, introducing the siege of Acre, appeared to the author not only natural, but in some measure necessary to break the uniformity of the subject. Oh for a view, as from that cloudless height Where the great Patriarch gazed upon the world, His offspring's future seat, back on the vale Of years departed! We might then behold Thebes, from her sleep of ages, awful rise, Like an imperial shadow, from the Nile, To airy harpings; and with lifted torch Scatter the darkness through the labyrinths Of death, where rest her kings, without a name, And light the winding caves and pyramids In the long night of years! We might behold Edom, in towery strength, majestic rise, And awe the Erithræan, to the plains Where Migdol frowned, and Baal-zephon stood, Before whose naval shrine the Memphian host And Pharaoh's pomp were shattered! As her fleets From Ezion went seaward, to the sound Of shouts and brazen trumpets, we might say, How glorious, Edom, in thy ships art thou, And mighty as the rushing winds! But night Is on the mournful scene: a voice is heard, As of the dead, from hollow sepulchres, And echoing caverns of the Nile—So pass The shades of mortal glory! One pure ray From Sinai bursts (where God of old revealed His glory, through the darkness terrible That sat on the dread Mount), and we descry Thy sons, O Noah! peopling wide the scene, From Shinar's plain to Egypt. Let the song Reveal, who first “went down to the great sea In ships,” and braved the stormy element. The Sons of Cush. Still fearful of the flood, They on the marble range and cloudy heights Of that vast mountain barrier,—which uprises High o'er the Red Sea coast, and stretches on With the sea-line of Afric's southern bounds To Sofala,—delved in the granite mass Their dark abode, spreading from rock to rock Their subterranean cities, whilst they heard, Secure, the rains of vexed Orion rush. Emboldened they descend, and now their fanes On Egypt's champaign darken, whilst the noise Of caravans is heard, and pyramids In the pale distance gleam. Imperial Thebes Starts, like a giant, from the dust; as when Some dread enchanter waves his wand, and towers And palaces far in the sandy wilds Spring up: and still, her sphinxes, huge and high, Her marble wrecks colossal, seem to speak The work of some great arm invisible, Surpassing human strength; while toiling Time, That sways his desolating scythe so vast, And weary havoc murmuring at his side, Smite them in vain. Heard ye the mystic song Resounding from her caverns as of yore? Sing to Osiris, for his ark No more in night profound Of ocean, fathomless and dark, Typhon has sunk! Aloud the sistrums ring— Osiris!—to our god Osiris sing!— And let the midnight shore to rites of joy resound! Thee, great restorer of the world, the song Darkly described, and that mysterious shrine That bore thee o'er the desolate abyss, When the earth sank with all its noise! So taught, The borderers of the Erithræan launch'd Their barks, and to the shores of Araby First their brief voyage stretched, and thence returned With aromatic gums, or spicy wealth Of India. Prouder triumphs yet await, For lo! where Ophir's gold unburied shines New to the sun; but perilous the way, O'er Ariana's spectred wilderness, Where ev'n the patient camel scarce endures The long, long solitude of rocks and sands, Parched, faint, and sinking, in his mid-day course. But see! upon the shore great Ammon stands— Be the deep opened! At his voice the deep Is opened; and the shading ships that ride With statelier masts and ampler hulls the seas, Have passed the Straits, and left the rocks and gates Of death. Where Asia's cape the autumnal surge Throws blackening back, beneath a hollow cove, Awhile the mariners their fearful course Ponder, ere yet they tempt the further deep; Then plunged into the sullen main, they cast The youthful victim, to the dismal gods Devoted, whilst the smoke of sacrifice Slowly ascends: Hear, King of Ocean! hear, Dark phantom! whether in thy secret cave Thou sittest, where the deeps are fathomless, Nor hear'st the waters hum, though all above Is uproar loud; or on the widest waste, Far from all land, mov'st in the noontide sun, With dread and lonely shadow; or on high Dost ride upon the whirling spires, and fume Of that enormous volume, that ascends Black to the skies, and with the thunder's roar Bursts, while the waves far on are still: Oh, hear, Dread power, and save! lest hidden eddies whirl The helpless vessels down,—down to the deeps Of night, where thou, O Father of the Storm, Dost sleep; or thy vast stature might appear High o'er the flashing waves, and (as thy beard Streamed to the cloudy winds) pass o'er their track, And they are seen no more; or monster-birds Darkening, with pennons lank, the morn, might bear The victims to some desert rock, and leave Their scattered bones to whiten in the winds! The Ocean-gods, with sacrifice appeased, Propitious smile; the thunder's roar has ceased, Smooth and in silence o'er the azure realm The tall ships glide along; for the South-West Cheerly and steady blows, and the blue seas Beneath the shadow sparkle; on they speed, The long coast varies as they pass from cove To sheltering cove, the long coast winds away; Till now emboldened by the unvarying gale, Still urging to the East, the sailors deem Some god inviting swells their willing sails, Or Destiny's fleet dragons through the surge Cut their mid-way, yoked to the beaked prows Unseen! Night after night the heavens' still cope, That glows with stars, they watch, till morning bears Airs of sweet fragrance o'er the yellow tide: Then Malabar her green declivities Hangs beauteous, beaming to the eye afar Like scenes of pictured bliss, the shadowy land Of soft enchantment. Now Salmala's peak Shines high in air, and Ceylon's dark green woods Beneath are spread; while, as the strangers wind Along the curving shores, sounds of delight Are heard; and birds of richest plumage, red And yellow, glance along the shades; or fly With morning twitter, circling o'er the mast, As singing welcome to the weary crew. Here rest, till westering gales again invite. Then o'er the line of level seas glide on, As the green deities of ocean guide, Till Ophir's distant hills spring from the main, And their long labours cease. Hence Asia slow Her length unwinds; and Siam and Ceylon Through wider channels pour their gems and gold To swell the pomp of Egypt's kings, or deck With new magnificence the rising dome Of Palestine's imperial lord. His wants To satisfy; “with comelier draperies” To clothe his shivering form; to bid his arm Burst, like the Patagonian's, the vain cords That bound his untried strength; to nurse the flame Of wider heart-ennobling sympathies;— For this young Commerce roused the energies Of man; else rolling back, stagnant and foul, Like the great element on which his ships Go forth, without the currents, winds, and tides That swell it, as with awful life, and keep From rank putrescence the long-moving mass: And He, the sovereign Maker of the world, So to excite man's high activities, Bad various climes their various produce pour. On Asia's plain mark where the cotton-tree Hangs elegant its golden gems; the date Sits purpling the soft lucid haze, that lights The still, pale, sultry landscape; breathing sweet Along old Ocean's billowy marge, the eve Bears spicy fragrance far; the bread-fruit shades The southern isles; and gems, and richest ore, Lurk in the caverned mountains of the west. With ampler shade the northern oak uplifts His strength, itself a forest, and descends Proud to the world of waves, to bear afar The wealth collected, on the swelling tides, To every land:—Where nature seems to mourn Her rugged outcast rocks, there Enterprise Leaps up; he gazes, like a god, around; He sees on other plains rich harvests wave; He marks far off the diamond blaze; he burns To reach the glittering prize; he looks; he speaks; The pines of Lebanon fall at his voice; He rears the towering mast: o'er the long main He wanders, and becomes, himself though poor, The sovereign of the globe! So Sidon rose; And Tyre, yet prouder o'er the subject waves,— When in his manlier might the Ammonian spread Beyond Philistia to the Syrian sands,— Crowned on her rocky citadel, beheld The treasures of all lands poured at her feet. Her daring prows the inland main disclosed; Freedom and Glory, Eloquence, and Arts, Follow their track, upspringing where they passed; Till, lo! another Thebes, an Athens springs, From the Ægean shores, and airs are heard, As of no mortal melody, from isles That strew the deep around! On to the Straits Where tower the brazen pillars to the clouds, Her vessels ride. But what a shivering dread Quelled their bold hopes, when on their watch by night The mariners first saw the distant flames Of Ætna, and its red portentous glare Streaking the midnight waste! 'Tis not thy lamp, Astarte, hung in the dun vault of night, To guide the wanderers of the main! Aghast They eye the fiery cope, and wait the dawn. Huge pitchy clouds upshoot, and bursting fires Flash through the horrid volume as it mounts; Voices are heard, and thunders muttering deep. Haste, snatch the oars, fly o'er the glimmering surge— Fly far—already louder thunders roll, And more terrific flames arise! Oh, spare, Dread Power! for sure some deity abides Deep in the central earth, amidst the reek Of sacrifice and blue sulphureous fume Involved. Perhaps the living Moloch there Rules in his horrid empire, amid flames, Thunders, and blackening volumes, that ascend And wrap his burning throne! So was their path, To those who first the cheerless ocean roamed, Darkened with dread and peril. Scylla here, And fell Charybdis, on their whirling gulph Sit, like the sisters of Despair, and howl, As the devoted ship, dashed on the crags, Goes down: and oft the neighbour shores are strewn With bones of strangers sacrificed, whose bark Has foundered nigh, where the red watch-tower glares Through darkness. Hence mysterious dread, and tales Of Polyphemus and his monstrous rout; And warbling syrens on the fatal shores Of soft Parthenope. Yet oft the sound Of sea-conch through the night from some rude rock Is heard, to warn the wandering passenger Of fiends that lurk for blood! These dangers past, The sea puts on new beauties: Italy, Beneath the blue soft sky beaming afar, Opens her azure bays; Liguria's gulph Is past; the Bætic rocks, and ramparts high, That close the world, appear. The dashing bark Bursts through the fearful frith: Ah! all is now One boundless billowy waste; the huge-heaved wave Beneath the keel turns more intensely blue; And vaster rolls the surge, that sweeps the shores Of Cerne, and the green Hesperides, And long-renowned Atlantis, whether sunk Now to the bottom of the “monstrous world;” Or was it but a shadow of the mind, Vapoury and baseless, like the distant clouds That seem the promise of an unknown land To the pale-eyed and wasted mariner, Cold on the rocking mast. The pilot plies, Now tossed upon Bayonna's mountain-surge, High to the north his way; when, lo! the cliffs Of Albion, o'er the sea-line rising calm And white, and Marazion's woody mount Lifting its dark romantic point between. So did thy ships to Earth's wide bounds proceed, O Tyre! and thou wert rich and beautiful In that thy day of glory. Carthage rose, Thy daughter, and the rival of thy fame, Upon the sands of Lybia; princes were Thy merchants; on thy golden throne thy state Shone, like the orient sun. Dark Lebanon Waved all his pines for thee; for thee the oaks Of Bashan towered in strength: thy galleys cut, Glittering, the sunny surge; thy mariners, On ivory benches, furled th' embroidered sails, That looms of Egypt wove, or to the oars, That measuring dipped, their choral sea-songs sung; The multitude of isles did shout for thee, And cast their emeralds at thy feet, and said— Queen of the Waters, who is like to thee! So wert thou glorious on the seas, and said'st, I am a God, and there is none like me. But the dread voice prophetic is gone forth:— Howl, for the whirlwind of the desert comes! Howl ye again, for Tyre, her multitude Of sins and dark abominations cry Against her, saith the Lord; in the mid seas Her beauty shall be broken; I will bring Her pride to ashes; she shall be no more, The distant isles shall tremble at the sound When thou dost fall; the princes of the sea Shall from their thrones come down, and cast away Their gorgeous robes; for thee they shall take up A bitter lamentation, and shall say— How art thou fallen, renowned city! thou, Who wert enthroned glorious on the seas, To rise no more! So visible, O God, Is thy dread hand in all the earth! Where Tyre In gold and purple glittered o'er the scene, Now the poor fisher dries his net, nor thinks How great, how rich, how glorious, once she rose! Meantime the furthest isle, cold and obscure, Whose painted natives roamed their woody wilds, From all the world cut off, that wondering marked Her stately sails approach, now in her turn Rises a star of glory in the West— Albion, the wonder of the illumined world! See there a Newton wing the highest heavens; See there a Herschell's daring hand withdraw The luminous pavilion, and the throne Of the bright sun reveal; there hear the voice Of holy truth amid her cloistered fane, As the clear anthem swells; see Taste adorn Her palaces; and Painting's fervid touch, That bids the canvas breathe; hear angel-strains, When Handel, or melodious Purcell, pours His sweetest harmonies; see Poesy Open her vales romantic, and the scenes Where Fancy, an enraptured votary, roves At eve; and hark! 'twas Shakspeare's voice! he sits Upon a high and charmed rock alone, And, like the genius of the mountain, gives The rapt song to the winds; whilst Pity weeps, Or Terror shudders at the changeful tones, As when his Ariel soothes the storm! Then pause, For the wild billows answer—Lycidas Is dead, young Lycidas, dead ere his prime, Whelmed in the deep, beyond the Orcades, Or where the “vision of the guarded Mount, Belerus holds.” Nor skies, nor earth, confine The march of England's glory; on she speeds— The unknown barriers of the utmost deep Her prow has burst, where the dread genius slept For ages undisturbed, save when he walked Amid the darkness of the storm! Her fleet Even now along the East rides terrible, Where early-rising commerce cheered the scene! Heard ye the thunders of her vengeance roll, As Nelson, through the battle's dark-red haze Aloft upon the burning prow directs, Where the dread hurricane, with sulphureous flash, Shall burst unquenchable, while from the grave Osiris ampler seems to rise? Where thou, O Tyre! didst awe the subject seas of yore, Acre even now, and ancient Carmel, hears The cry of conquest. 'Mid the fire and smoke Of the war-shaken citadel, with eye Of temper'd flame, yet resolute command, His brave sword beaming, and his cheering voice Heard 'mid the onset's cries, his dark-brown hair Spread on his fearless forehead, and his hand Pointing to Gallia's baffled chief, behold The British Hero stand! Why beats my heart With kindred animation? The warm tear Of patriot triumph fills mine eye. I strike A louder strain unconscious, while the harp Swells to the bold involuntary song. I. Fly, Son of Terror, fly! Back o'er the burning desert he is fled! In heaps the gory dead And livid in the trenches lie! His dazzling files no more Flash on the Syrian sands, As when from Egypt's ravaged shore, Aloft their gleamy falchions swinging, Aloud their victor pæans singing, Their onward way the Gallic legions took. Despair, dismay, are on his altered look, Yet hate indignant lowers; Whilst high on Acre's granite towers The shade of English Richard seems to stand; And frowning far, in dusky rows, A thousand archers draw their bows! They join the triumph of the British band, And the rent watch-tower echoes to the cry, Heard o'er the rolling surge—They fly, they fly! II. Now the hostile fires decline, Now through the smoke's deep volumes shine; Now above the bastions gray The clouds of battle roll away; Where, with calm, yet glowing mien, Britain's victorious youth is seen! He lifts his eye, His country's ensigns wave through smoke on high, Whilst the long-mingled shout is heard—They fly, they fly! III. Hoary Carmel, witness thou, And lift in conscious pride thy brow; As when upon thy cloudy plain Baal's prophets cried in vain! They gashed their flesh, and leaped, and cried, From morn till lingering even-tide. Then stern Elijah on his foes Strong in the might of Heaven arose!— On Carmel's top he stood, And while the blackening clouds and rain Came sounding from the Western main, Raised his right hand that dropped with impious blood. Ancient Kishon prouder swell, On whose banks they bowed, they fell, The mighty ones of yore, when, pale with dread, Inglorious Sisera fled! So let them perish, Holy Lord, Who for oppression lift the sword; But let all those who, armed for freedom, fight, “Be as the sun who goes forth in his might.” BOOK THE THIRD. BOOK THE THIRD Commences with the feelings excited by the conclusion of the last, by a warm wish that England may for ages retain her present elevated rank. This leads to the consideration of her naval opulence, which carries us back to the subject we had left—the fate of Tyre. The history of the empires succeeding Tyre is touched on: the fall of her destroyer, Babylon; the succession of Cyrus; the character of Cyrus, and his want of enlarged policy, having so many means of encouraging commerce; and his ill-fated expedition to the East Indies. Alexander the Great first conceives the idea of establishing a vast maritime empire: in his march of conquest, he proceeds to the last river of the Punjab, the Hyphasis, which descends into the Indus, the sources of which are near the mountains of Caucasus, where the ark rested. The Indian account of the Deluge, it is well known, resembles most wonderfully the history of Moses. When Alexander can proceed no further, poetical fiction introduces the person of a Brahmin, who relates the history of the Deluge: viz., that one sacred man was, in this part of the world, miraculously preserved by an ark; the further march of the conqueror towards the holy spot is deprecated: his best glory shall be derived from the sea, and from uniting either world in commerce. Alexander is animated with the idea; and his fleet, under Nearchus, proceeds down the Indus to the sea. This forms a middle, connected with the account of the Deluge, book first. My heart has sighed in secret, when I thought That the dark tide of time might one day close, England, o'er thee, as long since it has closed On Egypt and on Tyre: that ages hence, From the Pacific's billowy loneliness, Whose tract thy daring search revealed, some isle Might rise in green-haired beauty eminent, And like a goddess, glittering from the deep, Hereafter sway the sceptre of domain From pole to pole; and such as now thou art, Perhaps New-Holland be. For who shall say What the Omnipotent Eternal One, That made the world, hath purposed! Thoughts like these, Though visionary, rise; and sometimes move A moment's sadness, when I think of thee, My country, of thy greatness, and thy name, Among the nations; and thy character,— Though some few spots be on thy flowing robe,— Of loveliest beauty: I have never passed Through thy green hamlets on a summer's morn, Nor heard thy sweet bells ring, nor seen the youths And smiling maidens of thy villages, Gay in their Sunday tire, but I have said, With passing tenderness—Live, happy land, Where the poor peasant feels his shed, though small, An independence and a pride, that fill His honest heart with joy—joy such as they Who crowd the mart of men may never feel! Such, England, is thy boast. When I have heard The roar of ocean bursting 'round thy rocks, Or seen a thousand thronging masts aspire, Far as the eye could reach, from every port Of every nation, streaming with their flags O'er the still mirror of the conscious Thames,— Yes, I have felt a proud emotion swell That I was British-born; that I had lived A witness of thy glory, my most loved And honoured country; and a silent prayer Would rise to Heaven, that Fame and Peace, and Love And Liberty, might walk thy vales, and sing Their holy hymns, while thy brave arm repelled Hostility, even as thy guardian cliffs Repel the dash of that dread element Which calls me, lingering on the banks of Thames, On to my destined voyage, by the shores Of Asia, and the wreck of cities old, Ere yet we burst into the wilder deep With Gama; or the huge Atlantic waste With bold Columbus stem; or view the bounds Of field-ice, stretching to the southern pole, With thee, benevolent, lamented Cook! Tyre be no more! said the Almighty voice: But thou too, Monarch of the world, whose arm Rent the proud bulwarks of the golden queen Of cities, throned upon her subject seas, Art thou too fall'n? The whole earth is at rest: “They break forth into singing:” Lebanon Waves all his hoary pines, and seems to say, No feller now comes here; Hell from beneath Is moved to meet thy coming; it stirs up The dead for thee; the chief ones of the earth, Tyre and the nations, they all speak and say— Art thou become like us! Thy pomp brought down E'en to the dust! The noise of viols ceased, The worm spread under thee, the crawling worm To cover thee! How art thou fall'n from heaven, Son of the morning! In thy heart thou saidst, I will ascend to Heaven; I will exalt My throne above the stars of God! Die—die, Blasphemer! As a carcase under foot, Defiled and trodden, so be thou cast out! And she, the great, the guilty Babel—she Who smote the wasted cities, and the world Made as a wilderness—she, in her turn, Sinks to the gulf oblivious at the voice Of Him who sits in judgment on her crimes! Who, o'er her palaces and buried towers, Shall bid the owl hoot, and the bittern scream; And on her pensile groves and pleasant shades Pour the deep waters of forgetfulness. On that same night, when with a cry she fell, (Like her own mighty idol dashed to earth,) There was a strange eclipse, and long laments Were heard, and muttering thunders o'er the towers Of the high palace where his wassail loud Belshazzar kept, mocking the God of heaven, And flushed with impious mirth; for Bel had left With sullen shriek his golden shrine, and sat, With many a gloomy apparition girt, Nisroch and Nebo chief, in the dim sphere Of mooned Astoreth, whose orb now rolled In darkness:—They their earthly empire mourned; Meantime the host of Cyrus through the night Silent advanced more nigh; and at that hour, In the torch-blazing hall of revelry, The fingers of a shadowy hand distinct Came forth, and unknown figures marked the wall, Searing the eye-balls of the starting king: Tyre is avenged; Babel is fall'n, is fall'n! Bel and her gods are shattered! Prince, to thee Called by the voice of God to execute His will on earth, and raised to Persia's throne, Cyrus, all hearts pay homage. Touched with tints Most clear by the historian's magic art, Thy features wear a gentleness and grace Unlike the stern cold aspect and the frown Of the dark chiefs of yore, the gloomy clan Of heroes, from humanity and love Removed: To thee a brighter character Belongs—high dignity, unbending truth— Yet Nature; not that lordly apathy Which confidence and human sympathy Represses, but a soul that bids all hearts Smiling approach. We almost burn in thought To kiss the hand that loosed Panthea's chains, And bless him with a parent's, husband's tear, Who stood a guardian angel in distress To the unfriended, and the beautiful, Consigned a helpless slave. Thy portrait, touched With tints of softest light, thus wins all hearts To love thee; but severer policy, Cyrus, pronounces otherwise: she hears No stir of commerce on the sullen marge Of waters that along thy empire's verge Beat cheerless; no proud moles arise; no ships, Freighted with Indian wealth, glide o'er the main From cape to cape. But on the desert sands Hurtles thy numerous host, seizing, in thought Rapacious, the rich fields of Hindostan, As the poor savage fells the blooming tree To gain its tempting fruit; but woe the while! For in the wilderness the noise is lost Of all thy archers;—they have ceased;—the wind Blows o'er them, and the voice of judgment cries: So perish they who grasp with avarice Another's blessed portion, and disdain That interchange of mutual good, that crowns The slow, sure toil of commerce. It was thine, Immortal son of Macedon! to hang In the high fane of maritime renown The fairest trophies of thy fame, and shine, Then only like a god, when thy great mind Swayed in its master council the deep tide Of things, predestining th' eventful roll Of commerce, and uniting either world, Europe and Asia, in thy vast design. Twas when the victor, in his proud career, O'er ravaged Hindostan, had now advanced Beyond Hydaspes; on the flowery banks Of Hyphasis, with banners thronged, his camp Was spread. On high he bade the altars rise, The awful records to succeeding years Of his long march of glory, and to point The spot where, like the thunder rolled away, His army paused. Now shady eve came down; The trumpet sounded to the setting sun, That looked from his illumed pavilion, calm Upon the scene of arms, as if, all still, And lovely as his parting light, the world Beneath him spread; nor clangours, nor deep groans, Were heard, nor victory's shouts, nor sighs, nor shrieks, Were ever wafted from a bleeding land, After the havoc of a conqueror's sword. So calm the sun declined; when from the woods, That shone to his last beam, a Brahmin old Came forth. His streaming beard shone in the ray, That slanted o'er his feeble frame; his front Was furrowed. To the sun's last light he cast A look of sorrow, then in silence bowed Before the conqueror of the world. At once All, as in death, was still. The victor chief Trembled, he knew not why; the trumpet ceased Its clangor, and the crimson streamer waved No more in folds insulting to the Lord Of the reposing world. The pallid front Of the meek man seemed for a moment calm, Yet dark and thronging thoughts appeared to swell His beating heart. He paused—and then abrupt: Victor, avaunt! he cried, Hence! and the banners of thy pride Bear to the deep! Behold on high Yon range of mountains mingled with the sky! It is the place Where the great Father of the human race Rested, when all the world and all its sounds Ceased; and the ocean that surrounds The earth, leaped from its dark abode Beneath the mountains, and enormous flowed, The green earth deluging! List, soldier, list! And dread His might no mortal may resist. Great Bramah rested, hushed in sleep, When Hayagraiva came, With mooned horns and eyes of flame, And bore the holy Vedas to the deep. Far from the sun's rejoicing ray, Beneath the huge abyss, the buried treasures lay. Then foamed the billowy desert wide, And all that breathed—they died, Sunk in the rolling waters: such the crime And violence of earth. But he above, Great Vishnu, moved with pitying love, Preserved the pious king, whose ark sublime Floated, in safety borne: For his stupendous horn, Blazing like gold, and many a rood Extended o'er the dismal flood, The precious freight sustained, till on the crest Of Himakeel, yon mountain high, That darkly mingles with the sky, Where many a griffin roams, the hallowed ark found rest. And Heaven decrees that here Shall cease thy slaughtering spear: Enough we bleed, enough we weep, Hence, victor, to the deep! Ev'n now along the tide I see thy ships triumphant ride: I see the world of trade emerge From ocean's solitude! What fury fires My breast! The flood, the flood retires, And owns its future sovereign! Urge Thy destined way; what countless pennants stream! (Or is it but the shadow of a dream?) Ev'n now old Indus hails Thy daring prows in long array, That o'er the lone seas gliding, Around the sea-gods riding, Speed to Euphrates' shores their destined way. Fill high the bowl of mirth! From west to east the earth Proclaims thee Lord; shall the blue main Confine thy reign? But tremble, tyrant; hark in many a ring, With language dread Above thy head, The dark Assoors thy death-song sing. What mortal blow Hath laid the king of nations low? No hand: his own despair.— But shout, for the canvas shall swell to the air, Thy ships explore Unknown Persia's winding shore, While the great dragon rolls his arms in vain. And see, uprising from the level main, A new and glorious city springs;— Hither speed thy woven wings, That glance along the azure tide; Asia and Europe own thy might;— The willing seas of either world unite: Thy name shall consecrate the sands, And glittering to the sky the mart of nations stands. He spoke, and rushed into the thickest wood. With flashing eyes the impatient monarch cried— Yes, by the Lybian Ammon and the gods Of Greece, thou bid'st me on, the self-same track My spirit pointed; and, let death betide, My name shall live in glory! At his word The pines descend; the thronging masts aspire; The novel sails swell beauteous o'er the curves Of Indus; to the Moderators' song The oars keep time, while bold Nearchus guides Aloft the gallies. On the foremost prow The monarch from his golden goblet pours A full libation to the gods, and calls By name the mighty rivers, through whose course He seeks the sea. To Lybian Ammon loud The songs ascend; the trumpets bray; aloft The streamers fly, whilst on the evening wave Majestic to the main the fleet descends. BOOK THE FOURTH. BOOK THE FOURTH. Nearchus' voyage being accomplished, and Alexandria now complete, Commerce is represented as standing on the Pharos, and calling to all nations. The tide of commerce would have flowed still in the track pointed out by the sagacity of Alexander, but that a wider scene, beyond the ancient world, opens to the view of Discovery. The use of the magnet is discovered; and Henry of Portugal prosecutes the plan of opening a passage along the coast of Africa to the East. One of his ships on its return from the expedition has been driven from Cape Bojador (the formidable boundary of Portuguese research) by a storm at sea. The isle afterwards called Porto Santo is discovered. The circumstance related; but the extraordinary appearance of a supernatural shade over the waters at a distance excites many fears and superstitions. The attempt, however, to penetrate the mystery, is resolved on. Zarco reaches the island of Madeira; tomb found; which introduces the episode. At the tomb of the first discoverer (whether this be fanciful or not, is nothing to poetry) the Spirit of Discovery casts her eyes over the globe; she pursues De Gama to the East; history of Camoens touched on; Columbus; sees with triumph the discovery of a new world, and from thence extends her ideas till the great globe is encompassed; after which she returns to the “tranquil bosom of the Thames,” with Drake, the first circumnavigator, whose ship, after its various perils, being laid up in that river, gives rise to some brief concluding reflections. Stand on the gleaming Pharos, and aloud Shout, Commerce, to the kingdoms of the earth; Shout, for thy golden portals are set wide, And all thy streamers o'er the surge, aloft, In pomp triumphant wave. The weary way That pale Nearchus passed, from creek to creek Advancing slow, no longer bounds the track Of the adventurous mariner, who steers Steady, with eye intent upon the stars, To Elam's echoing port. Meantime, more high Aspiring, o'er the Western main her towers Th' imperial city lifts, the central mart Of nations, and beneath the calm clear sky, At distance from the palmy marge, displays Her clustering columns, whitening to the morn. Damascus' fleece, Golconda's gems, are there. Murmurs the haven with one ceaseless hum; The hurrying camel's bell, the driver's song, Along the sands resound. Tyre, art thou fall'n? A prouder city crowns the inland sea, Raised by his hand who smote thee; as if thus His mighty mind were swayed to recompense The evil of his march through cities stormed, And regions wet with blood! and still had flowed The tide of commerce through the destined track, Traced by his mind sagacious, who surveyed The world he conquered with a sage's eye, As with a soldier's spirit; but a scene More awful opens: ancient world, adieu! Adieu, cloud-piercing pillars, erst its bounds; And thou, whose aged head once seemed to prop The heavens, huge Atlas, sinking fast, adieu! What though the seas with wilder fury rave, Through their deserted realm; though the dread Cape, Sole-frowning o'er the war of waves below, That bar the seaman's search, horrid in air Appear with giant amplitude; his head Shrouded in clouds, the tempest at his feet, And standing thus terrific, seem to say, Incensed—Approach who dare! What though the fears Of superstition people the vexed space With spirits unblessed, that lamentations make To the sad surge beyond—yet Enterprise, Not now a darkling Cyclop on the sands Striding, but led by Science, and advanced To a more awful height, on the wide scene Looks down commanding. Does a shuddering thought Of danger start, as the tumultuous sea Tosses below! Calm Science, with a smile, Displays the wondrous index, that still points, With nice vibration tremulous, to the Pole. And such, she whispers, is the just man's hope In this tempestuous scene of human things; Even as the constant needle to the North Still points; so Piety and meek-eyed Faith Direct, though trembling oft, their constant gaze Heavenward, as to their lasting home, nor fear The night, fast closing on their earthly way. And guided by this index, thou shall pass The world of seas secure. Far from all land, Where not a sea-bird wanders; where nor star, Nor moon appears, nor the bright noonday sun, Safe in the wildering storm, as when the breeze Of summer gently blows; through day, through night, Where sink the well-known stars, and others rise Slow from the South, the victor bark shall ride. Henry! thy ardent mind first pierced the gloom Of dark disastrous ignorance, that sat Upon the Southern wave, like the deep cloud That lowered upon the woody skirts, and veiled From mortal search, with umbrage ominous, Madeira's unknown isle. But look! the morn Is kindled on the shadowy offing; streaks Of clear cold light on Sagres' battlements Are cast, where Henry watches, listening still To the unwearied surge; and turning still His anxious eyes to the horizon's bounds. A sail appears; it swells, it shines: more high Seen through the dusk it looms; and now the hull Is black upon the surge, whilst she rolls on Aloft—the weather-beaten ship—and now Streams by the watch-tower! Zarco, from the deep What tidings? The loud storm of night prevailed, And swept our vessel from Bojador's rocks Far out to sea; a sylvan isle received Our sails; so willed the Almighty—He who speaks, And all the waves are still! Hail, Henry cried, The omen: we have burst the sole barrier, (Prosper our wishes, Father of the world!) We speed to Asia. Soon upon the deep The brave ship speeds again. Bojador's rocks Arise at distance, frowning o'er the surf, That boils for many a league without. Its course The ship holds on; till lo! the beauteous isle, That shielded late the sufferers from the storm, Springs o'er the wave again. Here they refresh Their wasted strength, and lift their vows to Heaven, But Heaven denies their further search; for ah! What fearful apparition, palled in clouds, For ever sits upon the Western wave, Like night, and in its strange portentous gloom Wrapping the lonely waters, seems the bounds Of Nature? Still it sits, day after day, The same mysterious vision. Holy saints! Is it the dread abyss where all things cease? Or haply hid from mortal search, thine isle, Cipango, and that unapproached seat Of peace, where rest the Christians whom the hate Of Moorish pride pursued? Whate'er it be, Zarco, thy holy courage bids thee on To burst the gloom, though dragons guard the shore, Or beings more than mortal pace the sands. The favouring gales invite; the bowsprit bears Right onward to the fearful shade; more black The cloudy spectre towers; already fear Shrinks at the view aghast and breathless. Hark! 'Twas more than the deep murmur of the surge That struck the ear; whilst through the lurid gloom Gigantic phantoms seem to lift in air Their misty arms; yet, yet—bear boldly on— The mist dissolves;—seen through the parting haze, Romantic rocks, like the depictured clouds, Shine out; beneath a blooming wilderness Of varied wood is spread, that scents the air; Where fruits of “golden rind,” thick interspersed And pendent, through the mantling umbrage gleam Inviting. Cypress here, and stateliest pine, Spire o'er the nether shades, as emulous Of sole distinction where all nature smiles. Some trees, in sunny glades alone their head And graceful stem uplifting, mark below The turf with shadow; whilst in rich festoons The flowery lianes braid their boughs; meantime Choirs of innumerous birds of liveliest song And brightest plumage, flitting through the shades, With nimble glance are seen; they, unalarmed, Now near in airy circles sing, then speed Their random flight back to their sheltering bowers, Whose silence, broken only by their song, From the foundation of this busy world, Perhaps had never echoed to the voice, Or heard the steps, of Man. What rapture fired The strangers' bosoms, as from glade to glade They passed, admiring all, and gazing still With new delight! 'Tis solitude around; Deep solitude, that on the gloom of woods Primæval fearful hangs: a green recess Now opens in the wilderness; gay flowers Of unknown name purple the yielding sward; The ring-dove murmurs o'er their head, like one Attesting tenderest joy; but mark the trees, Where, slanting through the gloom, the sunshine rests! Beneath, a moss-grown monument appears, O'er which the green banana gently waves Its long leaf; and an aged cypress near Leans, as if listening to the streamlet's sound, That gushes from the adverse bank; but pause— Approach with reverence! Maker of the world, There is a Christian's cross! and on the stone A name, yet legible amid its moss,— Anna! In that remote, sequestered spot, Shut as it seemed from all the world, and lost In boundless seas, to trace a name, to mark The emblems of their holy faith, from all Drew tears; while every voice faintly pronounced, Anna! But thou, loved harp! whose strings have rung To louder tones, oh! let my hand, awhile, The wires more softly touch, whilst I rehearse Her name and fate, who in this desert deep, Far from the world, from friends, and kindred, found Her long and last abode; there where no eye Might shed a tear on her remains; no heart Sigh in remembrance of her fate:— She left The Severn's side, and fled with him she loved O'er the wide main; for he had told her tales Of happiness in distant lands, where care Comes not; and pointing to the golden clouds That shone above the waves, when evening came, Whispered—Oh, are there not sweet scenes of peace, Far from the murmurs of this cloudy mart,— Where gold alone bears sway,—scenes of delight, Where love may lay his head upon the lap Of innocence, and smile at all the toil Of the low-thoughted throng, that place in wealth Their only bliss! Yes, there are scenes like these. Leave the vain chidings of the world behind, Country, and hollow friends, and fly with me Where love and peace in distant vales invite. What wouldst thou here! Oh, shall thy beauteous look Of maiden innocence, thy smile of youth, thine eyes Of tenderness and soft subdued desire, Thy form, thy limbs—oh, madness!—be the prey Of a decrepit spoiler, and for gold?— Perish his treasure with him. Haste with me; We shall find out some sylvan nook, and then, If thou shouldst sometimes think upon these hills, When they are distant far, and drop a tear, Yes—I will kiss it from thy cheek, and clasp Thy angel beauties closer to my breast; And whilst the winds blow o'er us, and the sun Sinks beautifully down, and thy soft cheek Reclines on mine, I will infold thee thus, And proudly cry, My friend—my love—my wife! So tempted he, and soon her heart approved, Nay wooed, the blissful dream; and oft at eve, When the moon shone upon the wandering stream, She paced the castle's battlements, that threw Beneath their solemn shadow, and, resigned To fancy and to tears, thought it most sweet To wander o'er the world with him she loved. Nor was his birth ignoble, for he shone 'Mid England's gallant youth in Edward's reign: With countenance erect, and honest eye Commanding (yet suffused in tenderness At times), and smiles that like the lightning played On his brown cheek,—so gently stern he stood, Accomplished, generous, gentle, brave, sincere,— Robert a Machin. But the sullen pride Of haughty D'Arfet scorned all other claim To his high heritage, save what the pomp Of amplest wealth and loftier lineage gave. Reckless of human tenderness, that seeks One loved, one honoured object, wealth alone He worshipped; and for this he could consign His only child, his aged hope, to loathed Embraces, and a life of tears! Nor here His hard ambition ended; for he sought, By secret whispers of conspiracies, His sovereign to abuse, bidding him lift His arm avenging, and upon a youth Of promise close the dark forgotten gates Of living sepulture, and in the gloom Inhume the slowly-wasting victim. So He purposed, but in vain; the ardent youth Rescued her—her whom more than life he loved, Ev'n when the horrid day of sacrifice Drew nigh. He pointed to the distant bark, And while he kissed a stealing tear that fell On her pale cheek, as trusting she reclined Her head upon his breast, with ardour cried— Be mine, be only mine! the hour invites; Be mine, be only mine! So won, she cast A look of last affection on the towers Where she had passed her infant days, that now Shone to the setting sun. I follow thee, Her faint voice said; and lo! where in the air A sail hangs tremulous, and soon her feet Ascend the vessel's side: The vessel glides Down the smooth current, as the twilight fades, Till soon the woods of Severn, and the spot Where D'Arfet's solitary turrets rose, Is lost; a tear starts to her eye, she thinks Of him whose gray head to the earth shall bend, When he speaks nothing—but be all, like death, Forgotten. Gently blows the placid breeze, And oh! that now some fairy pinnace light Might flit across the wave (by no seen power Directed, save when Love upon the prow Gathered or spread with tender hand the sail), That now some fairy pinnace, o'er the surge Silent, as in a summer's dream, might waft The passengers upon the conscious flood To regions bright of undisturbed joy! But hark! The wind is in the shrouds;—the cordage sings With fitful violence;—the blast now swells, Now sinks. Dread gloom invests the further wave, Whose foaming toss alone is seen, beneath The veering bowsprit. Oh, retire to rest, Maiden, whose tender heart would beat, whose cheek Turn pale to see another thus exposed! Hark! the deep thunder louder peals—Oh, save!— The high mast crashes; but the faithful arm Of love is o'er thee, and thy anxious eye, Soon as the gray of morning peeps, shall view Green Erin's hills aspiring! The sad morn Comes forth; but terror on the sunless wave Still, like a sea-fiend, sits, and darkly smiles Beneath the flash that through the struggling clouds Bursts frequent, half revealing his scathed front, Above the rocking of the waste that rolls Boundless around. No word through the long day She spoke;—another slowly came;—no word The beauteous drooping mourner spoke. The sun Twelve times had sunk beneath the sullen surge, And cheerless rose again:—Ah, where are now Thy havens, France! But yet—resign not yet— Ye lost seafarers—oh, resign not yet All hope—the storm is passed; the drenched sail Shines in the passing beam! Look up, and say— Heaven, thou hast heard our prayers! And lo! scarce seen, A distant dusky spot appears;—they reach An unknown shore, and green and flowery vales, And azure hills, and silver-gushing streams, Shine forth; a Paradise, which Heaven alone, Who saw the silent anguish of despair, Could raise in the waste wilderness of waves. They gain the haven; through untrodden scenes, Perhaps untrodden by the foot of man Since first the earth arose, they wind. The voice Of Nature hails them here with music, sweet, As waving woods retired, or falling streams, Can make; most soothing to the weary heart, Doubly to those who, struggling with their fate, And wearied long with watchings and with grief, Seek but a place of safety. All things here Whisper repose and peace; the very birds That 'mid the golden fruitage glance their plumes, The songsters of the lonely valley, sing— Welcome from scenes of sorrow, live with us. The wild wood opens, and a shady glen Appears, embowered with mantling laurels high, That sloping shade the flowery valley's side; A lucid stream, with gentle murmur, strays Beneath the umbrageous multitude of leaves, Till gaining, with soft lapse, the nether plain, It glances light along its yellow bed;— The shaggy inmates of the forest lick The feet of their new guests, and gazing stand. A beauteous tree upshoots amid the glade Its trembling top; and there upon the bank They rest them, while each heart o'erflows with joy. Now evening, breathing richer odours sweet, Came down: a softer sound the circling seas, The ancient woods resounded, while the dove, Her murmurs interposing, tenderness Awaked, yet more endearing, in the hearts Of those who, severed wide from human kind, Woman and man, by vows sincere betrothed, Heard but the voice of Nature. The still moon Arose—they saw it not—cheek was to cheek Inclined, and unawares a stealing tear Witnessed how blissful was that hour, that seemed Not of the hours that time could count. A kiss Stole on the listening silence; ne'er till now Here heard; they trembled, ev'n as if the Power That made the world, that planted the first pair In Paradise, amid the garden walked:— This since the fairest garden that the world Has witnessed, by the fabling sons of Greece Hesperian named, who feigned the watchful guard Of the scaled Dragon, and the Golden Fruit. Such was this sylvan Paradise; and here The loveliest pair, from a hard world remote, Upon each other's neck reclined; their breath Alone was heard, when the dove ceased on high Her plaint; and tenderly their faithful arms Infolded each the other. Thou, dim cloud, That from the search of men these beauteous vales Hast closed, oh, doubly veil them! But alas, How short the dream of human transport! Here, In vain they built the leafy bower of love, Or culled the sweetest flowers and fairest fruit. The hours unheeded stole! but ah, not long— Again the hollow tempest of the night Sounds through the leaves; the inmost woods resound; Slow comes the dawn, but neither ship nor sail Along the rocking of the windy waste Is seen: the dash of the dark-heaving wave Alone is heard. Start from your bed of bliss, Poor victims! never more shall ye behold Your native vales again; and thou, sweet child! Who, listening to the voice of love, hast left Thy friends, thy country,—oh, may the wan hue Of pining memory, the sunk cheek, the eye Where tenderness yet dwells, atone (if love Atonement need, by cruelty and wrong Beset), atone ev'n now thy rash resolves! Ah, fruitless hope! Day after day, thy bloom Fades, and the tender lustre of thy eye Is dimmed: thy form, amid creation, seems The only drooping thing. Thy look was soft, And yet most animated, and thy step Light as the roe's upon the mountains. Now, Thou sittest hopeless, pale, beneath the tree That fanned its joyous leaves above thy head, Where love had decked the blooming bower, and strewn The sweets of summer: Death is on thy cheek, And thy chill hand the pressure scarce returns Of him, who, agonised and hopeless, hangs With tears and trembling o'er thee. Spare the sight,— She faints—she dies!— He laid her in the earth, Himself scarce living, and upon her tomb Beneath the beauteous tree where they reclined, Placed the last tribute of his earthly love. INSCRIPTION FOR THE GRAVE OF ANNA D'ARFET. O'er my poor Anna's lowly grave No dirge shall sound, no knell shall ring; But angels, as the high pines wave, Their half-heard “Miserere” sing. No flowers of transient bloom at eve The maidens on the turf shall strew; Nor sigh, as the sad spot they leave, Sweets to the sweet! a long adieu! But in this wilderness profound, O'er her the dove shall build her nest; And ocean swell with softer sound A requiem to her dreams of rest! Ah! when shall I as quiet be, When not a friend, or human eye, Shall mark beneath the mossy tree The spot where we forgotten lie! To kiss her name on the cold stone, Is all that now on earth I crave; For in this world I am alone— Oh, lay me with her in the grave! Robert a Machin, 1344. Miserere nobis, Domine. He placed the rude inscription on her stone, Which he with faltering hands had graved, and soon Himself beside it sunk—yet ere he died, Faintly he spoke: If ever ye shall hear, Companions of my few and evil days, Again the convent's vesper bells, oh! think Of me; and if in after-times the search Of men should reach this far removed spot, Let sad remembrance raise an humble shrine, And virgin choirs chaunt duly o'er our grave: Peace, peace! His arm upon the mournful stone He dropped; his eyes, ere yet in death they closed, Turned to the name, till he could see no more Anna. His pale survivors, earth to earth, Weeping consigned his poor remains, and placed Beneath the sod where all he loved was laid. Then shaping a rude vessel from the woods, They sought their country o'er the waves, and left Those scenes once more to deepest solitude. The beauteous ponciana hung its head O'er the gray stone; but never human eye Had mark'd the spot, or gazed upon the grave Of the unfortunate, but for the voice Of Enterprise, that spoke, from Sagre's towers, Through ocean's perils, storms, and unknown wastes— Speed we to Asia! Here, Discovery, pause!— Then from the tomb of him who first was cast Upon this Heaven-appointed isle, thy gaze Uplift, and far beyond the Cape of Storms Pursue De Gama's tract. Mark the rich shores Of Madagascar, till the purple East Shines in luxuriant beauty wide disclosed. But cease thy song, presumptuous Muse!—a bard, In tones whose patriot sound shall never die, Has struck his deep shell, and the glorious theme Recorded. Say, what lofty meed awaits The triumph of his victor conch, that swells Its music on the yellow Tagus' side, As when Arion, with his glittering harp And golden hair, scarce sullied from the main, Bids all the high rocks listen to his voice Again! Alas, I see an aged form, An old man worn by penury, his hair Blown white upon his haggard cheek, his hand Emaciated, yet the strings with thrilling touch Soliciting; but the vain crowds pass by: His very countrymen, whose fame his song Has raised to heaven, in stately apathy Wrapped up, and nursed in pride's fastidious lap, Regard not. As he plays, a sable man Looks up, but fears to speak, and when the song Has ceased, kisses his master's feeble hand. Is that cold wasted hand, that haggard look, Thine, Camoens? Oh, shame upon the world! And is there none, none to sustain thee found, But he, himself unfriended, who so far Has followed, severed from his native isles, To scenes of gorgeous cities, o'er the sea, Thee and thy broken fortunes! God of worlds! Oh, whilst I hail the triumph and high boast Of social life, let me not wrong the sense Of kindness, planted in the human heart By man's great Maker, therefore I record Antonio's faithful, gentle, generous love To his heartbroken master, that might teach, High as it bears itself, a polished world More charity. Discovery, turn thine eyes! Columbus' toiling ship is on the deep, Stemming the mid Atlantic. Waste and wild The view! On the same sunshine o'er the waves The murmuring mariners, with languid eye, Ev'n till the heart is sick, gaze day by day! At midnight in the wind sad voices sound! When the slow morning o'er the offing dawns, Heartless they view the same drear weltering waste Of seas: and when the sun again goes down Silent, hope dies within them, and they think Of parting friendship's last despairing look! See too, dread prodigy, the needle veers Her trembling point—will Heaven forsake them too! But lift thy sunk eye, and thy bloodless look, Despondence! Milder airs at morning breathe:— Below the slowly-parting prow the sea Is dark with weeds; and birds of land are seen To wing the desert tract, as hasting on To the green valleys of their distant home. Yet morn succeeds to morn—and nought around Is seen, but dark weeds floating many a league, The sun's sole orb, and the pale hollowness Of heaven's high arch streaked with the early clouds. Watchman, what from the giddy mast? A shade Appears on the horizon's hazy line. Land! land! aloud is echoed; but the spot Fades as the shouting crew delighted gaze— It fades, and there is nothing—nothing now But the blue sky, the clouds, and surging seas! As one who, in the desert, faint with thirst, Upon the trackless and forsaken sands Sinks dying; him the burning haze deceives, As mocking his last torments, while it seems, To his distempered vision, like th' expanse Of lucid waters cool: so falsely smiles Th' illusive land upon the water's edge, To the long-straining eye showing what seems Its headlands and its distant trending shores;— But all is false, and like the pensive dream Of poor imagination, 'mid the waves Of troubled life, decked with unreal hues, And ending soon in emptiness and tears. 'Tis midnight, and the thoughtful chief, retired From the vexed crowd, in his still cabin hears The surge that rolls below; he lifts his eyes, And casts a silent anxious look without. It is a light—great God—it is a light! It moves upon the shore!—Land—there is land! He spoke in secret, and a tear of joy Stole down his cheek, when on his knees he fell. Thou, who hast been his guardian in wastes Of the hoar deep, accept his tears, his prayers; While thus he fondly hopes the purer light Of thy great truths on the benighted world Shall beam! The lingering night is past;—the sun Shines out, while now the red-cross streamers wave High up the gently-surging bay. From all Shouts, songs, and rapturous thanksgiving loud, Burst forth: Another world, entranced they cry, Another living world!—Awe-struck and mute The gazing natives stand, and drop their spears, In homage to the gods! So from the deep They hail emerging; sight more awful far Than ever yet the wondering voyager Greeted;—the prospect of a new-found world, Now from the night of dark uncertainty At once revealed in living light! How beats The heart! What thronging thoughts awake! Whence sprung The roaming nations? From that ancient race That peopled Asia—Noah's sons? How, then, Passed they the long and lone expanse between Of stormy ocean, from the elder earth Cut off, and lost, for unknown ages, lost In the vast deep? But whilst the awful view Stands in thy sight revealed, Spirit, awake To prouder energies! Even now, in thought, I see thee opening bold Magellan's tract! The straits are passed! Thou, as the seas expand, Pausest a moment, when beneath thine eye Blue, vast, and rocking, through its boundless rule, The long Pacific stretches. Nor here cease Thy search, but with De Quiros to the South Still urge thy way, if yet some continent Stretch to its dusky pole, with nations spread, Forests, and hills, and streams. So be thy search With ampler views rewarded, till, at length, Lo, the round world is compassed! Then return Back to the bosom of the tranquil Thames, And hail Britannia's victor ship, that now From many a storm restored, winds its slow way Silently up the current, and so finds, Like to a time-worn pilgrim of the world, Rest, in that haven where all tempests cease. BOOK THE FIFTH. BOOK THE FIFTH. Hitherto we have described only the triumphs of Discovery; but it appears necessary that many incidental evils, special and general, should be mentioned. Fate and miserable end of some great commanders,—of our gallant and benevolent countryman, Cook. After the natural feelings of regret, the mind is led to contemplate the great advantages of his voyages: the health of seamen; the accessions to geographical knowledge; the spirit of humanity and science; his exploring the east part of New-Holland; and being the first to determine the proximity of America to Asia. This circumstance leads us back from the point whence we set out—the ark of Noah; and hence we are partly enabled to solve, what has been for so many ages unknown, the difficulty respecting the earth's being peopled from one family. The poem having thus gained a middle and end, the conclusion of the whole is, that as this uncertainty in the physical world has been by Discovery cleared up, so all the apparent contradictions in the moral world shall be reconciled. We have yet many existing evils to deplore; but when the Supreme Disposer's plan shall have been completed, then the earth, which has been explored and enlightened by discovery and knowledge, shall be destroyed; but the mind of man, rendered at last perfect, shall endure through all ages, and “justify His ways from whom it sprung.” Such are thy views, Discovery! The great world Rolls to thine eye revealed; to thee the Deep Submits its awful empire; Industry Awakes, and Commerce to the echoing marts From east to west unwearied pours her wealth. Man walks sublimer; and Humanity, Matured by social intercourse, more high, More animated, lifts her sovereign mien, And waves her golden sceptre. Yet the heart Asks trembling, is no evil found! Oh, turn, Meek Charity, and drop a human tear For the sad fate of Afric's injured sons, And hide, for ever hide, the sight of chains, Anguish, and bondage! Yes, the heart of man Is sick, and Charity turns pale, to think How soon, for pure religion's holy beam, Dark crimes, that sullied the sweet day, pursued, Like vultures, the Discoverer's ocean tract, Screaming for blood, to fields of rich Peru, Or ravaged Mexico, while Gold more Gold! The caverned mountains echoed, Gold more Gold! Then see the fell-eyed, prowling buccaneer, Grim as a libbard! He his jealous look Turns to the dagger at his belt, his hand By instinct grasps a bloody scymitar, And ghastly is his smile, as o'er the woods He sees the smoke of burning villages Ascend, and thinks ev'n now he counts his spoil. See thousands destined to the lurid mine, Never to see the sun again; all names Of husband, sire, all tender charities Of love, deep buried with them in that grave, Where life is as a thing long passed; and hope No more its sickly ray, to cheer the gloom, Extends. Thou, too, dread Ocean, toss thine arms, Exulting, for the treasures and the gems That thy dark oozy realm emblaze; and call The pale procession of the dead, from caves Where late their bodies weltered, to attend Thy kingly sceptre, and proclaim thy might! Lord of the Hurricane! bid all thy winds Swell, and destruction ride upon the surge, Where, after the red lightning flash that shows The labouring ship, all is at once deep night And long suspense, till the slow dawn of day Gleams on the scattered corses of the dead, That strew the sounding shore! Then think of him, Ye who rejoice with those you love, at eve, When winds of winter shake the window-frame, And more endear your fire, oh, think of him, Who, saved alone from the destroying storm, Is cast on some deserted rock; who sees Sun after sun descend, and hopeless hears At morn the long surge of the troubled main, That beats without his wretched cave; meantime He fears to wake the echoes with his voice, So dread the solitude! Let Greenland's snows Then shine, and mark the melancholy train There left to perish, whilst the cold pale day Declines along the further ice, that binds The ship, and leaves in night the sinking scene. Sad winter closes on the deep; the smoke Of frost, that late amusive to the eye Rose o'er the coast, is passed, and all is now One torpid blank; the freezing particles Blown blistering, and the white bear seeks her cave. Ill-fated outcasts, when the morn again Shall streak with feeble beam the frozen waste, Your air-bleached and unburied carcases Shall press the ground, and, as the stars fade off, Your stony eyes glare 'mid the desert snows! These triumphs boast, fell Demon of the Deep! Though never more the universal shriek Of all that perish thou shalt hear, as when The deep foundations of the guilty earth Were shaken at the voice of God, and man Ceased in his habitations; yet the sea Thy might tempestuous still, and joyless rule, Confesses. Ah! what bloodless shadows throng Ev'n now, slow rising from their oozy beds, From Mete, and those gates of burial That guard the Erythræan; from the vast Unfathomed caverns of the Western main Or stormy Orcades; whilst the sad shell Of poor Arion, to the hollow blast Slow seems to pour its melancholy tones, And faintly vibrate, as the dead pass by. I see the chiefs, who fell in distant lands, The prey of murderous savages, when yells, And shouts, and conch, resounded through the woods. Magellan and De Solis seem to lead The mournful train. Shade of Perouse! oh, say Where, in the tract of unknown seas, thy bones Th' insulting surge has swept? But who is he, Whose look, though pale and bloody, wears the trace Of pure philanthropy? The pitying sigh Forbid not; he was dear to Britons, dear To every beating heart, far as the world Extends; and my faint faltering touch ev'n now Dies on the strings, when I pronounce thy name, Oh, lost, lamented, generous, hapless Cook! But cease the vain complaint; turn from the shores, Wet with his blood, Remembrance: cast thine eyes Upon the long seas, and the wider world, Displayed from his research. Smile, glowing Health! For now no more the wasted seaman sinks, With haggard eye and feeble frame diseased; No more with tortured longings for the sight Of fields and hillocks green, madly he calls On Nature, when before his swimming eye The liquid long expanse of cheerless seas Seems all one flowery plain. Then frantic dreams Arise; his eye's distemper'd flash is seen From the sunk socket, as a demon there Sat mocking, till he plunges in the flood, And the dark wave goes o'er him. Nor wilt thou, O Science! fail to deck the cold morai Of him who wider o'er earth's hemisphere Thy views extended. On, from deep to deep, Thou shalt retrace the windings of his track; From the high North to where the field-ice binds The still Antarctic. Thence, from isle to isle, Thou shalt pursue his progress; and explore New-Holland's eastern shores, where now the sons Of distant Britain, from her lap cast out, Water the ground with tears of penitence, Perhaps, hereafter, in their destined time, Themselves to rise pre-eminent. Now speed, By Asia's eastern bounds, still to the North, Where the vast continents of either world Approach: Beyond, 'tis silent boundless ice, Impenetrable barrier, where all thought Is lost; where never yet the eagle flew, Nor roamed so far the white bear through the waste. But thou, dread Power! whose voice from chaos called The earth, who bad'st the Lord of light go forth, Ev'n as a giant, and the sounding seas Roll at thy fiat: may the dark deep clouds, That thy pavilion shroud from mortal sight, So pass away, as now the mystery, Obscure through rolling ages, is disclosed; How man, from one great Father sprung, his race Spread to that severed continent! Ev'n so, Father, in thy good time, shall all things stand Revealed to knowledge. As the mind revolves The change of mighty empires, and the fate Of him whom Thou hast made, back through the dusk Of ages Contemplation turns her view: We mark, as from its infancy, the world Peopled again, from that mysterious shrine That rested on the top of Ararat, Highest of Asian mountains; spreading on, The Cushites from their mountain caves descend; Then before God the sons of Ammon stood In their gigantic might, and first the seas Vanquished: But still from clime to clime the groan Of sacrifice, and Superstition's cry, Was heard; but when the Dayspring rose of heaven, Greece's hoar forests echoed, The great Pan Is dead! From Egypt, and the rugged shores Of Syrian Tyre, the gods of darkness fly; Bel is cast down, and Nebo, horrid king, Bows in imperial Babylon: But, ah! Too soon, the Star of Bethlehem, whose ray The host of heaven hailed jubilant, and sang, Glory to God on high, and on earth peace, With long eclipse is veiled. Red Papacy Usurped the meek dominion of the Lord Of love and charity: vast as a fiend She rose, Heaven's light was darkened with her frown, And the earth murmured back her hymns of blood, As the meek martyr at the burning stake Stood, his last look uplifted to his God! But she is now cast down, her empire reft. They who in darkness walked, and in the shade Of death, have seen a new and holy light, As in th' umbrageous forest, through whose boughs, Mossy and damp, for many a league, the morn With languid beam scarce pierces, here and there Touching some solitary trunk, the rest Dark waving in the noxious atmosphere: Through the thick-matted leaves the serpent winds His way, to find a spot of casual sun; The gaunt hyæna through the thicket glides At eve: then, too, the couched tiger's eye Flames in the dusk, and oft the gnashing jaws Of the fell crocodile are heard. At length, By man's superior energy and toil, The sunless brakes are cleared; the joyous morn Shines through the opening leaves; rich culture smiles Around; and howling to their distant wilds The savage inmates of the wood retire. Such is the scene of human life, till want Bids man his strength put forth; then slowly spreads The cultured stream of mild humanity, And gentler virtues, and more noble aims Employ the active mind, till beauty beams Around, and Nature wears her richest robe, Adorned with lovelier graces. Then the charms Of woman, fairest of the works of Heaven, Whom the cold savage, in his sullen pride, Scorned as unworthy of his equal love, With more attractive influence wins the heart Of her protector. Then the names of sire, Of home, of brother, and of children, grow More sacred, more endearing; whilst the eye, Lifted beyond this earthly scene, beholds A Father who looks down from heaven on all! O Britain, my loved country! dost thou rise Most high among the nations! Do thy fleets Ride o'er the surge of ocean, that subdued Rolls in long sweep beneath them! Dost thou wear Thy garb of gentler morals gracefully! Is widest science thine, and the fair train Of lovelier arts! While commerce throngs thy ports With her ten thousand streamers, is the tract Of the undeviating ploughshare white That rips the reeking furrow, followed soon By plenty, bidding all the scene rejoice, Even like a cultured garden! Do the streams That steal along thy peaceful vales, reflect Temples, and Attic domes, and village towers! Is beauty thine, fairest of earthly things, Woman; and doth she gain that liberal love And homage, which the meekness of her voice, The rapture of her smile, commanding most When she seems weakest, must demand from him, Her master; whose stern strength at once submits In manly, but endearing, confidence, Unlike his selfish tyranny who sits The sultan of his harem! Oh, then, think How great the blessing, and how high thy rank Amid the civilised and social world! But hast thou no deep failings, that may turn Thy thoughts within thyself! Ask, for the sun That shines in heaven hath seen it, hath thy power Ne'er scattered sorrow over distant lands! Ask of the East, have never thy proud sails Borne plunder from dismembered provinces, Leaving the groans of miserable men Behind! And free thyself, and lifting high The charter of thy freedom, bought with blood, Hast thou not stood, in patient apathy, A witness of the tortures and the chains That Afric's injured sons have known! Stand up; Yes, thou hast visited the caves, and cheered The gloomy haunts of sorrow; thou hast shed A beam of comfort and of righteousness On isles remote; hast bid the bread-fruit shade Th' Hesperian regions, and has softened much With bland amelioration, and with charms Of social sweetness, the hard lot of man. But weighed in truth's firm balance, ask, if all Be even. Do not crimes of ranker growth Batten amid thy cities, whose loud din, From flashing and contending cars, ascends, Till morn! Enchanting, as if aught so sweet Ne'er faded, do thy daughters wear the weeds Of calm domestic peace and wedded love; Or turn, with beautiful disdain, to dash Gay pleasure's poisoned chalice from their lips Untasted! Hath not sullen atheism, Weaving gay flowers of poesy, so sought To hide the darkness of his withered brow With faded and fantastic gallantry Of roses, thus to win the thoughtless smile Of youthful ignorance! Hast thou with awe Looked up to Him whose power is in the clouds, Who bids the storm rush, and it sweeps to earth The nations that offend, and they are gone, Like Tyre and Babylon! Well weigh thyself: Then shalt thou rise undaunted in the might Of thy Protector, and the gathered hate Of hostile bands shall be but as the sand Blown on the everlasting pyramid. Hasten, O Love and Charity! your work, Ev'n now whilst it is day; far as the world Extends may your divinest influence Be felt, and more than felt, to teach mankind They all are brothers, and to drown the cries Of superstition, anarchy, or blood! Not yet the hour is come: on Ganges' banks Still superstition hails the flame of death, Behold, gay dressed, as in her bridal tire, The self-devoted beauteous victim slow Ascend the pile where her dead husband lies: She kisses his cold cheeks, inclines her breast On his, and lights herself the fatal pile That shall consume them both! On Egypt's shore, Where Science rose, now Sloth and Ignorance Sleep like the huge Behemoth in the sun! The turbaned Moor still stains with strangers' blood The inmost sands of Afric. But all these The light shall visit, and that vaster tract From Fuego to the furthest Labrador, Where roam the outcast Esquimaux, shall hear The voice of social fellowship; the chief Whose hatchet flashed amid the forest gloom, Who to his infants bore the bleeding scalp Of his fall'n foe, shall weep unwonted tears! Come, Faith; come, Hope; come, meek-eyed Charity! Complete the lovely prospect: every land Shall lift up one hosannah; every tongue Proclaim thee Father, infinite, and wise, And good. The shores of palmy Senegal (Sad Afric's injured sons no more enslaved) Shall answer Hallelujah, for the Lord Of truth and mercy reigns;—reigns King of kings;— Hosannah—King of kings—and Lord of lords! So may His kingdom come, when all the earth, Uniting thus as in one hymn of praise, Shall wait the end of all things. This great globe, His awful plan accomplished, then shall sink In flames, whilst through the clouds, that wrap the place Where it had rolled, and the sun shone, the voice Of the Archangel, and the trump of God, Amid heaven's darkness rolling fast away, Shall sound! Then shall the sea give up its dead;— But man's immortal mind, all trials past That shook his feverish frame, amidst the scenes Of peril and distemper, shall ascend Exulting to its destined seat of rest, And ‘justify His ways” from whom it sprung. THE MISSIONARY. The chief event of the poem turns upon the conduct of Lautaro; but as the Missionary acts so distinguished a part, and as the whole of the moral depends upon him, it was thought better to retain the title which was originally given to the poem. Amor patriæ ratione potentior omni. Scene—South America. Characters. —Valdivia, commander of the Spanish armies —Lautaro, his page, a native of Chili —Anselmo, the missionary —Indiana, his adopted daughter, wife of Lautaro —Zarinel, the wandering minstrel. Indians. —Attacapac, father of Lautaro —Olola, his daughter, sister of Lautaro —Caupolican, chief of the Indians —Indian warriors. INTRODUCTION. When o'er the Atlantic wild, rocked by the blast, Sad Lusitania's exiled sovereign passed, Reft of her pomp, from her paternal throne Cast forth, and wandering to a clime unknown, To seek a refuge on that distant shore, That once her country's legions dyed with gore;— Sudden, methought, high towering o'er the flood, Hesperian world! thy mighty genius stood; Where spread, from cape to cape, from bay to bay, Serenely blue, the vast Pacific lay; And the huge Cordilleras to the skies With all their burning summits seemed to rise. Then the stern spirit spoke, and to his voice The waves and woods replied:—Mountains, rejoice! Thou solitary sea, whose billows sweep The margin of my forests, dark and deep, Rejoice! the hour is come: the mortal blow, That smote the golden shrines of Mexico, In Europe is avenged; and thou, proud Spain, Now hostile hosts insult thy own domain; Now Fate, vindictive, rolls, with refluent flood, Back on thy shores the tide of human blood, Think of my murdered millions! of the cries That once I heard from all my kingdoms rise; Of Famine's feeble plaint, of Slavery's tear;— Think, too, if Valour, Freedom, Fame, be dear, How my Antarctic sons, undaunted, stood, Exacting groan for groan, and blood for blood; And shouted, (may the sounds be hailed by thee!) Tyrants, the virtuous and the brave are free! CANTO FIRST. One Day and Part of Night. ARGUMENT. Valley in the Andes—Old Indian warrior—Loss of his son and daughter. Beneath aërial cliffs, and glittering snows, The rush-roof of an aged warrior rose, Chief of the mountain tribes: high overhead, The Andes, wild and desolate, were spread, Where cold Sierras shot their icy spires, And Chillan trailed its smoke and smouldering fires. A glen beneath, a lonely spot of rest, Hung, scarce discovered, like an eagle's nest. Summer was in its prime;—the parrot-flocks Darkened the passing sunshine on the rocks; The chrysomel and purple butterfly, Amid the clear blue light, are wandering by; The humming-bird, along the myrtle bowers, With twinkling wing, is spinning o'er the flowers, The woodpecker is heard with busy bill, The mock-bird sings—and all beside is still, And look! the cataract that bursts so high, As not to mar the deep tranquillity, The tumult of its dashing fall suspends, And, stealing drop by drop, in mist descends; Through whose illumined spray and sprinkling dews, Shine to the adverse sun the broken rainbow hues. Chequering, with partial shade, the beams of noon, And arching the gray rock with wild festoon, Here its gay net-work, and fantastic twine, The purple cogul threads from pine to pine, And oft, as the fresh airs of morning breathe, Dips its long tendrils in the stream beneath. There, through the trunks with moss and lichens white, The sunshine darts its interrupted light, And, 'mid the cedar's darksome boughs, illumes, With instant touch, the Lori's scarlet plumes. So smiles the scene;—but can its smiles impart Aught to console yon mourning warrior's heart? He heeds not now, when beautifully bright, The humming-bird is circling in his sight; Nor ev'n, above his head, when air is still, Hears the green woodpecker's resounding bill; But gazing on the rocks and mountains wild, Rock after rock, in glittering masses piled To the volcano's cone, that shoots so high Gray smoke whose column stains the cloudless sky, He cries, Oh! if thy spirit yet be fled To the pale kingdoms of the shadowy dead,— In yonder tract of purest light above, Dear long-lost object of a father's love, Dost thou abide; or like a shadow come, Circling the scenes of thy remembered home, And passing with the breeze, or, in the beam Of evening, light the desert mountain stream! Or at deep midnight are thine accents heard, In the sad notes of that melodious bird, Which, as we listen with mysterious dread, Brings tidings from our friends and fathers dead? Perhaps, beyond those summits, far away, Thine eyes yet view the living light of day; Sad, in the stranger's land, thou may'st sustain A weary life of servitude and pain, With wasted eye gaze on the orient beam, And think of these white rocks and torrent stream, Never to hear the summer cocoa wave, Or weep upon thy father's distant grave. Ye, who have waked, and listened with a tear, When cries confused, and clangours rolled more near; With murmured prayer, when Mercy stood aghast, As War's black trump pealed its terrific blast, And o'er the withered earth the armed giant passed! Ye, who his track with terror have pursued, When some delightful land, all blood-imbrued, He swept; where silent is the champaign wide, That echoed to the pipe of yester-tide, Save, when far off, the moonlight hills prolong That last deep echoes of his parting gong; Nor aught is seen, in the deserted spot Where trailed the smoke of many a peaceful cot, Save livid corses that unburied lie, And conflagrations, reeking to the sky;— Come listen, whilst the causes I relate That bowed the warrior to the storms of fate, And left these smiling scenes forlorn and desolate. In other days, when, in his manly pride, Two children for a father's fondness vied,— Oft they essayed, in mimic strife, to wield His lance, or laughing peeped behind his shield; Oft in the sun, or the magnolia's shade, Lightsome of heart as gay of look they played, Brother and sister. She, along the dew, Blithe as the squirrel of the forest flew; Blue rushes wreathed her head; her dark-brown hair Fell, gently liftde, on her bosom bare; Her necklace shone, of sparkling insects made, That flit, like specks of fire, from sun to shade. Light was her form; a clasp of silver braced The azure-dyed ichella round her waist; Her ancles rung with shells, as unconfined She danced, and sung wild carols to the wind. With snow-white teeth, and laughter in her eye, So beautiful in youth she bounded by. Yet kindness sat upon her aspect bland,— The tame alpaca stood and licked her hand; She brought him gathered moss, and loved to deck With flowery twine his tall and stately neck, Whilst he with silent gratitude replies, And bends to her caress his large blue eyes. These children danced together in the shade, Or stretched their hands to see the rainbow fade; Or sat and mocked, with imitative glee, The paroquet, that laughed from tree to tree; Or through the forest's wildest solitude, From glen to glen, the marmozet pursued; And thought the light of parting day too short, That called them, lingering, from their daily sport. In that fair season of awakening life, When dawning youth and childhood are at strife; When on the verge of thought gay boyhood stands Tiptoe, with glistening eye and outspread hands; With airy look, and form and footsteps light, And glossy locks, and features berry-bright, And eye like the young eaglet's, to the ray Of noon unblenching as he sails away; A brede of sea-shells on his bosom strung, A small stone-hatchet o'er his shoulder slung, With slender lance, and feathers blue and red, That, like the heron's crest, waved on his head,— Buoyant with hope, and airiness, and joy, Lautaro was a graceful Indian boy: Taught by his sire, ev'n now he drew the bow, Or tracked the jagguar on the morning snow; Startled the condor, on the craggy height; Then silent sat, and marked its upward flight, Lessening in ether to a speck of white. But when the impassioned chieftain spoke of war, Smote his broad breast, or pointed to a scar,— Spoke of the strangers of the distant main, And the proud banners of insulting Spain,— Of the barbed horse and iron horseman spoke, And his red gods, that, wrapped in rolling smoke, Roared from the guns;—the boy, with still-drawn breath, Hung on the wondrous tale, as mute as death; Then raised his animated eyes, and cried, Oh, let me perish by my father's side! Once, when the moon, o'er Chillan's cloudless height, Poured, far and wide, its softest, mildest light, A predatory band of mailed men Burst on the stillness of the sheltered glen: They shouted, Death! and shook their sabres high, That shone terrific to the moonlight sky; Where'er they rode, the valley and the hill Echoed the shrieks of death, till all again was still. The warrior, ere he sank in slumber deep, Had kissed his son, soft-breathing in his sleep, Where on a Llama's skin he lay, and said, Placing his hand, with tears, upon his head, Aërial nymphs! that in the moonlight stray, O gentle spirits! here awhile delay; Bless, as ye pass unseen, my sleeping boy, Till blithe he wakes to daylight and to joy. If the great spirit will, in future days, O'er the fall'n foe his hatchet he shall raise, And, 'mid a grateful nation's high applause, Avenge his violated country's cause! Now, nearer points of spears, and many a cone Of moving helmets, in the moonlight shone, As, clanking through the pass, the band of blood Sprang, like hyænas, from the secret wood. They rush, they seize their unresisting prey, Ruthless they tear the shrieking boy away; But, not till gashed by many a sabre wound, The father sank, expiring, on the ground. He waked from the dark trance to life and pain, But never saw his darling child again. Seven snows had fallen, and seven green summers passed, Since here he heard that son's loved accents last. Still his beloved daughter soothed his cares, Whilst time began to strew with white his hairs. Oft as his painted feathers he unbound, Or gazed upon his hatchet on the ground, Musing with deep despair, nor strove to speak, Light she approached, and climbed to reach his cheek, Held with both hands his forehead, then her head Drew smiling back, and kissed the tear he shed. But late, to grief and hopeless love a prey, She left his side, and wandered far away. Now in this still and shelter'd glen, that smiled Beneath the crags of precipices wild, Wrapt in a stern yet sorrowful repose, The warrior half forgot his country's woes; Forgot how many, impotent to save, Shed their best blood upon a father's grave; How many, torn from wife and children, pine In the dark caverns of the hopeless mine, Never to see again the blessed morn;— Slaves in the lovely land where they were born; How many at sad sunset, with a tear, The distant roar of sullen cannons hear, Whilst evening seems, as dies the sound, to throw A deadlier stillness on a nation's woe! So the dark warrior, day succeeding day, Wore in distempered thought the noons away; And still, when weary evening came, he sighed, My son, my son! or, with emotion, cried, When I descend to the cold grave alone, Who shall be there to mourn for me?—Not one! The crimson orb of day now westering flung His beams, and o'er the vast Pacific hung; When from afar a shrilling sound was heard, And, hurrying o'er the dews, a scout appeared. The watchful warrior knew the piercing tones, The signal-call of war, from human bones,— What tidings? with impatient look, he cried. Tidings of war, the hurrying scout replied; Then the sharp pipe with shriller summons blew, And held the blood-red arrow high in view. CHIEF. Where speed the foes? INDIAN. Along the southern main, Have passed the vultures of accursed Spain. CHIEF. Ruin pursue them on the distant flood, And be their deadly portion—blood for blood! INDIAN. When, round and red, the moon shall next arise, The chiefs attend the midnight sacrifice In Encol's wood, where the great wizard dwells, Who wakes the dead man by his thrilling spells; Thee, Ulmen of the Mountains, they command To lift the hatchet for thy native land; Whilst in dread circle, round the sere-wood smoke, The mighty gods of vengeance they invoke; And call the spirits of their fathers slain, To nerve their lifted arm, and curse devoted Spain. So spoke the scout of war;—and o'er the dew, Onward along the craggy valley, flew. Then the stern warrior sang his song of death— And blew his conch, that all the glens beneath Echoed, and rushing from the hollow wood, Soon at his side three hundred warriors stood. WARRIOR. Children, who for his country dares to die? Three hundred brandished spears shone to the sky: We perish, or we leave our country free; Father, our blood for Chili and for thee! The mountain-chief essayed his club to wield, And shook the dust indignant from the shield. Then spoke:— O Thou! that with thy lingering light Dost warm the world, till all is hushed in night; I look upon thy parting beams, O sun! And say, ev'n thus my course is almost run. When thou dost hide thy head, as in the grave, And sink to glorious rest beneath the wave, Dost thou, majestic in repose, retire, Below the deep, to unknown worlds of fire! Yet though thou sinkest, awful, in the main, The shadowy moon comes forth, and all the train Of stars, that shine with soft and silent light, Making so beautiful the brow of night. Thus, when I sleep within the narrow bed, The light of after-fame around shall spread; The sons of distant Ocean, when they see The grass-green heap beneath the mountain tree, And hear the leafy boughs at evening wave, Shall pause and say, There sleep in dust the brave! All earthly hopes my lonely heart have fled! Stern Guecubu, angel of the dead, Who laughest when the brave in pangs expire; Whose dwelling is beneath the central fire Of yonder burning mountain; who hast passed O'er my poor dwelling, and with one fell blast Scattered my summer-leaves that clustered round, And swept my fairest blossoms to the ground; Angel of dire despair, oh! come not nigh, Nor wave thy red wings o'er me where I lie; But thou, O mild and gentle spirit! stand, Angel of hope and peace, at my right hand, (When blood-drops stagnate on my brow) and guide My pathless voyage o'er the unknown tide, To scenes of endless joy, to that fair isle, Where bowers of bliss, and soft savannahs smile: Where my forefathers oft the fight renew, And Spain's black visionary steeds pursue; Where, ceased the struggles of all human pain, I may behold thee—thee, my son, again! He spoke, and whilst at evening's glimmering close The distant mist, like the gray ocean, rose, With patriot sorrows swelling at his breast, He sank upon a jagguar's hide to rest. 'Twas night: remote on Caracalla's bay, Valdivia's army, hushed in slumber, lay. Around the limits of the silent camp, Alone was heard the steed's patroling tramp From line to line, whilst the fixed sentinel Proclaimed the watch of midnight—All is well! Valdivia dreamed of millions yet untold, Villrica's gems, and El Dorado's gold! What different feelings, by the scene impressed, Rose in sad tumult o'er Lautaro's breast! On the broad ocean, where the moonlight slept, Thoughtful he turned his waking eyes, and wept, And whilst the thronging forms of memory start, Thus holds communion with his lonely heart: Land of my fathers, still I tread your shore, And mourn the shade of hours that are no more; Whilst night-airs, like remembered voices, sweep, And murmur from the undulating deep. Was it thy voice, my father! Thou art dead, The green rush waves on thy forsaken bed. Was it thy voice, my sister! Gentle maid, Thou too, perhaps, in the dark cave art laid; Perhaps, even now, thy spirit sees me stand A homeless stranger in my native land; Perhaps, even now, along the moonlight sea, It bends from the blue cloud, remembering me! Land of my fathers! yet, oh yet forgive, That with thy deadly enemies I live: The tenderest ties (it boots not to relate) Have bound me to their service, and their fate; Yet, whether on Peru's war-wasted plain, Or visiting these sacred shores again, Whate'er the struggles of this heart may be, Land of my fathers, it shall beat for thee! CANTO SECOND. The Second Day ARGUMENT. Night—Spirit of the Andes—Valdivia—Lautaro—Missionary—The Hermitage. The night was still and clear, when, o'er the snows, Andes! thy melancholy Spirit rose,— A shadow stern and sad: he stood alone, Upon the topmost mountain's burning cone; And whilst his eyes shone dim, through surging smoke, Thus to the spirits of the fire he spoke:— Ye, who tread the hidden deeps, Where the silent earthquake sleeps; Ye, who track the sulphurous tide, Or on hissing vapours ride,— Spirits, come! From worlds of subterraneous night; From fiery realms of lurid light; From the ore's unfathomed bed; From the lava's whirlpools red,— Spirits, come! On Chili's foes rush with vindictive sway, And sweep them from the light of living day! Heard ye not the ravenous brood, That flap their wings, and scream for blood? On Peru's devoted shore Their murderous beaks are red with gore; Yet here, impatient for new prey, The insatiate vultures track their way. Let them perish! they, whose bands Swept remote and peaceful lands! Let them perish!—on their head, Descend the darkness of the dead! Spirits, now your caves forsake: Hark! ten thousand warriors wake!— Spirits, their high cause defend!— From your caves ascend! ascend! As thus the Genius of the Andes spoke, The trembling mountain heaved with darker smoke; Lightnings, and phantom-forms, by fits appeared; His mighty voice far off Osorno heard; The caverned deeps shook through their vast profound, And Chimborazzo's height rolled back the sound. With lifted arm, and towering stature high, And aspect frowning to the middle sky (Its misty form dilated in the wind), The phantom stood,—till, less and less defined, Into thin air it faded from the sight, Lost in the ambient haze of slow-returning light. Its feathery-seeming crown, its giant spear, Its limbs of huge proportion, disappear; And the bare mountains to the dawn disclose The same long line of solitary snows. The morning shines, the military train Streams far and wide along the tented plain; And plaited cuirasses, and helms of steel, Throw back the sunbeams, as the horsemen wheel: Thus, with arms glancing to the eastern light, Pass, in review, proud steeds and cohorts bright; For all the host, by break of morrow's gray, Wind back their march to Penco's northern bay, Valdivia, fearful lest confederate foes, Ambushed and dark, his progress might oppose, Marshals to-day the whole collected force, File and artillery, cuirassier and horse: Himself yet lingers ere he joins the train, That moves, in ordered march, along the plain, While troops, and Indian slaves beneath his eye, The labours of the rising city ply: Wide glows the general toil; the mole extends, The watch-tower o'er the desert surge ascends; And battlements, and rising ramparts, shine Above the ocean's blue and level line. The sun ascended to meridian height, And all the northern bastions shone in light; With hoarse acclaim, the gong and trumpet rung, The Moorish slaves aloft their cymbals swung, When the proud victor, in triumphant state, Rode forth, in arms, through the portcullis' gate. With neck high-arching as he smote the ground, And restless pawing to the trumpet's sound,— With mantling mane, o'er his broad shoulders spread, And nostrils blowing, and dilated red,— The coal-black steed, in rich caparison Far trailing to the ground, went proudly on. Proudly he tramped, as conscious of his charge, And turned around his eye-balls, bright and large, And shook the frothy boss, as in disdain; And tossed the flakes, indignant, off his mane; And, with high-swelling veins, exulting pressed Proudly against the barb his heaving breast. The fate of empires glowing in his thought, Thus armed, the tented field Valdivia sought. On the left side his poised shield he bore, With quaint devices richly blazoned o'er; Above the plumes, upon his helmet's cone, Castile's imperial crest illustrious shone; Blue in the wind the escutcheoned mantle flowed, O'er the chained mail, which tinkled as he rode. The barred vizor raised, you might discern His clime-changed countenance, though pale, yet stern, And resolute as death,—whilst in his eye Sat proud Assurance, Fame, and Victory. Lautaro, now in manhood's rising pride, Rode, with a lance, attendant at his side, In Spanish mantle gracefully arrayed; Upon his brow a tuft of feathers played: His glossy locks, with dark and mantling grace, Shaded the noonday sunbeams on his face. Though passed in tears the dayspring of his youth, Valdivia loved his gratitude and truth: He, in Valdivia, owned a nobler friend; Kind to protect, and mighty to defend. So, on he rode; upon his youthful mien A mild but sad intelligence was seen; Courage was on his open brow, yet care Seemed like a wandering shade to linger there; And though his eye shone, as the eagle's, bright, It beamed with humid, melancholy light When now Valdivia saw the embattled line, Helmets, and swords, and shields, and matchlocks, shine; Now the long phalanx still and steady stand, Fixed every eye, and motionless each hand; Then slowly clustering, into columns wheel, Each with the red-cross banners of Castile; While trumps, and drums, and cymbals, to his ear Made music such as soldiers love to hear; While horsemen checked their steeds, or, bending low With levelled lances, o'er the saddle-bow, Rode gallantly at tilt; and thunders broke, Instant involving van and rear in smoke, Till winds the obscuring volume rolled away, And the red file, stretched out in long array, More radiant moved beneath the beams of day; While ensigns, arms, and crosses, glittered bright,— Philip! he cried, seest thou the glorious sight? And dost thou deem the tribes of this poor land Can men, and arms, and steeds, like these, withstand? Forgive!—the youth replied, and checked a tear,— The land where my forefathers sleep is dear!— My native land!—this spot of blessed earth, The scene where I, and all I love, had birth! What gratitude fidelity can give Is yours, my lord!—you shielded—bade me live, When, in the circuit of the world so wide, I had but one, one only friend beside. I bowed resigned to fate; I kissed the hand, Red with the best blood of my father's land! But mighty as thou art, Valdivia, know, Though Cortes' desolating march laid low The shrines of rich, voluptuous Mexico; With carcases, though proud Pizarro strew The Sun's imperial temple in Peru, Yet the rude dwellers of this land are brave, And the last spot they lose will be their grave! A moment's crimson crossed Valdivia's cheek— Then o'er the plain he spurred, nor deigned to speak, Waving the youth, at distance, to retire; None saw the eye that shot terrific fire. As their commander sternly rode along, Troop after troop, halted the martial throng; And all the pennoned trumps a louder blast Blew, as the Southern World's great victor passed. Lautaro turned, scarce heeding, from the view, And from the noise of trumps and drums withdrew; And now, while troubled thoughts his bosom swell, Seeks the gray Missionary's humble cell. Fronting the ocean, but beyond the ken Of public view, and sounds of murmuring men, Of unhewn roots composed, and gnarled wood, A small and rustic oratory stood; Upon its roof of reeds appeared a cross, The porch within was lined with mantling moss; A crucifix and hour-glass, on each side— One to admonish seemed, and one to guide; This, to impress how soon life's race is o'er; And that, to lift our hopes where time shall be no more. O'er the rude porch, with wild and gadding stray, The clustering copu weaved its trellis gay; Two mossy pines, high bending, interwove Their aged and fantastic arms above. In front, amid the gay surrounding flowers, A dial counted the departing hours, On which the sweetest light of summer shone,— A rude and brief inscription marked the stone: To count, with passing shade, the hours, I placed the dial 'mid the flowers; That, one by one, came forth, and died, Blooming, and withering, round its side. Mortal, let the sight impart Its pensive moral to thy heart! Just heard to trickle through a covert near, And soothing, with perpetual lapse, the ear, A fount, like rain-drops, filtered through the stone, And, bright as amber, on the shallows shone. Intent his fairy pastime to pursue, And, gem-like, hovering o'er the violets blue, The humming-bird, here, its unceasing song Heedlessly murmured, all the summer long; And when the winter came, retired to rest, And from the myrtles hung its trembling nest. No sounds of a conflicting world were near; The noise of ocean faintly met the ear, That seemed, as sunk to rest the noontide blast, But dying sounds of passions that were past; Or closing anthems, when, far off, expire The lessening echoes of the distant choir. Here, every human sorrow hushed to rest, His pale hands meekly crossed upon his breast, Anselmo sat: the sun, with westering ray, Just touched his temples, and his locks of gray. There was no worldly feeling in his eye; The world to him was “as a thing gone by.” Now, all his features lit, he raised his look, Then bent it thoughtful, and unclasped the book; And whilst the hour-glass shed its silent sand, A tame opossum licked his withered hand. That sweetest light of slow-declining day, Which through the trellis poured its slanting ray, Resting a moment on his few gray hairs, Seemed light from heaven sent down to bless his prayers. When the trump echoed to the quiet spot, He thought upon the world, but mourned it not; Enough if his meek wisdom could control, And bend to mercy, one proud soldier's soul; Enough, if, while these distant scenes he trod, He led one erring Indian to his God. Whence comes my son? with kind complacent look He asked, and closed again the embossed book. I come to thee for peace, the youth replied: Oh, there is strife, and cruelty, and pride, In this sad Christian world! My native land Was happy, ere the soldier, with his band Of fell destroyers, like a vulture, came, And gave its peaceful scenes to blood and flame. When will the turmoil of earth's tempests cease? Father, I come to thee for peace—for peace! Seek peace, the father cried, with God above: In His good time, all will be peace and love. We mourn, indeed, mourn that all sounds of ill, Earth's fairest scenes with one deep murmur fill; That yonder sun, when evening paints the sky, Sinks, beauteous, on a world of misery; The course of wide destruction to withstand, We lift our feeble voice—our trembling hand; But still, bowed low, or smitten to the dust, Father of mercy, still in Thee we trust! Through good or ill, in poverty or wealth, In joy or woe, in sickness or in health, Meek Piety thy awful hand surveys, And the faint murmur turns to prayer and praise! We know—whatever evils we deplore— Thou hast permitted, and we know no more! Behold, illustrious on the subject plain, Some tow'r-crowned city of imperial Spain! Hark! 'twas the earthquake! clouds of dust alone Ascend from earth, where tower and temple shone! Such is the conqueror's dread path: the grave Yawns for its millions where his banners wave; But shall vain man, whose life is but a sigh, With sullen acquiescence gaze and die? Alas, how little of the mighty maze Of Providence our mortal ken surveys! Heaven's awful Lord, pavilioned in the clouds, Looks through the darkness that all nature shrouds; And, far beyond the tempest and the night, Bids man his course hold on to scenes of endless light. CANTO THIRD. Evening and Night of the same Day. ARGUMENT. Anselmo's story—Converted Indians—Confession of the Wandering Minstrel—Night-Scene. Come,—for the sun yet hangs above the bay,— And whilst our time may brook a brief delay With other thoughts, and, haply with a tear, An old man's tale of sorrow thou shalt hear. I wished not to reveal it;—thoughts that dwell Deep in the lonely bosom's inmost cell Unnoticed, and unknown, too painful wake, And, like a tempest, the dark spirit shake, When, starting from our slumberous apathy, We gaze upon the scenes of days gone by. Yet, if a moment's irritating flush, Darkens thy cheek, as thoughts conflicting rush, When I disclose my hidden griefs, the tale May more than wisdom or reproof prevail. Oh, may it teach thee, till all trials cease, To hold thy course, though sorrowing, yet in peace; Still looking up to Him, the soul's best stay, Who Faith and Hope shall crown, when worlds are swept away! Where fair Seville's Morisco turrets gleam On Guadilquiver's gently-stealing stream; Whose silent waters, seaward as they glide, Reflect the wild-rose thickets on its side, My youth was passed. Oh, days for ever gone! How touched with Heaven's own light your mornings shone! Even now, when lonely and forlorn I bend, My weary journey hastening to its end, A drooping exile on a distant shore, I mourn the hours of youth that are no more. The tender thought amid my prayers has part, And steals, at times, from Heaven my aged heart. Forgive the cause, O God!—forgive the tear, That flows, even now, o'er Leonora's bier; For, 'midst the innocent and lovely, none More beautiful than Leonora shone. As by her widowed mother's side she knelt, A sad and sacred sympathy I felt. At Easter-tide, when the high mass was sung, And, fuming high, the silver censer swung; When rich-hued windows, from the arches' height, Poured o'er the shrines a soft and yellow light; From aisle to aisle, amid the service clear, When “Adoremus” swelled upon the ear. (Such as to Heaven thy rapt attention drew First in the Christian churches of Peru), She seemed, methought, some spirit of the sky, Descending to that holy harmony. But wherefore tell, when life and hope were new, How by degrees the soul's first passion grew! I loved her, and I won her virgin heart; But fortune whispered, we a while must part. The minster tolled the middle hour of night, When, waked to agony and wild affright, I heard those words, words of appalling dread— “The Holy Inquisition!”—from the bed I started; snatched my dagger, and my cloak— Who dare accuse me!—none, in answer, spoke. The demons seized, in silence, on their prey, And tore me from my dreams of bliss away. How frightful was their silence, and their shade, In torch-light, as their victim they conveyed, By dark-inscribed, and massy-windowed walls, Through the dim twilight of terrific halls; (For thou hast heard me speak of that foul stain Of pure religion, and the rights of Spain;) Whilst the high windows shook to night's cold blast, And echoed to the foot-fall as we passed! They left me, faint and breathless with affright, In a cold cell, to solitude and night; Oh! think, what horror through the heart must thrill When the last bolt was barred, and all at once was still! Nor day nor night was here, but a deep gloom, Sadder than darkness, wrapped the living tomb. Some bread and water, nature to sustain, Duly was brought when eve returned again; And thus I knew, hoping it were the last, Another day of lingering life was passed. Five years immured in that deep den of night, I never saw the sweet sun's blessed light. Once as the grate, with sullen sound, was barred, And to the bolts the inmost cavern jarred, Methought I heard, as clanged the iron door, A dull and hollow echo from the floor; I stamped; the vault, and winding caves around, Returned a long and melancholy sound. With patient toil I raised a massy stone, And looked into a depth of shade unknown; The murky twilight of the lurid place Helped me, at length, a secret way to trace: I entered; step by step explored the road, In darkness, from my desolate abode; Till, winding through long passages of night, I saw, at distance, a dim streak of light:— It was the sun—the bright, the blessed beam Of day! I knelt—I wept;—the glittering stream Rolled on beneath me, as I left the cave, Concealed in woods above the winding wave. I rested on a verdant bank a while, I saw around the summer landscape smile; I gained a peasant's hut; nor dared to leave, Till, with slow step, advanced the glimmering eve. Remembering still affection's fondest hours, I turned my footsteps to the city towers; In pilgrim's dress, I traced the streets unknown: No light in Leonora's lattice shone. The morning came; the busy tumult swells; Knolling to church, I heard the minster bells; Involuntary to that scene I strayed, Disguised, where first I saw my faithful maid. I saw her, pallid, at the altar stand, And yield, half-shrinking, her reluctant hand; She turned her head; she saw my hollow eyes, And knew me, wasted, wan, in my disguise; She shrieked, and fell;—breathless, I left the fane In agony—nor saw her form again; And from that day her voice, her look were given, Her name, her memory, to the winds of heaven. Far off I bent my melancholy way, Heart-sick and faint, and, in this gown of gray, From every human eye my sorrows hid, Unknown, amidst the tumult of Madrid. Grief in my heart, despair upon my look, With no companion save my beads and book, My morsel with Affliction's sons to share, To tend the sick and poor, my only care, Forgotten, thus I lived; till day by day Had worn nigh thirteen years of grief away. One winter's night, when I had closed my cell, And bid the labours of the day farewell, An aged crone approached, with panting breath, And bade me hasten to the house of death. I came. With moving lips intent to pray, A dying woman on a pallet lay; Her lifted hands were wasted to the bone, And ghastly on her look the lamp-light shone; Beside the bed a pious daughter stands Silent, and, weeping, kisses her pale hands. Feebly she spoke, and raised her languid head, Forgive, forgive!—they told me he was dead!— But in the sunshine of that dreadful day, That gave me to another's arms away, I saw him, like a ghost, with deadly stare; I saw his wasted eye-balls' ghastly glare; I saw his lips (oh, hide them, God of love!) I saw his livid lips, half-muttering, move, To curse the maid—forgetful of her vow:— Perhaps he lives to curse—to curse me now! He lives to bless! I cried; and, drawing nigh, Held up the crucifix; her heavy eye She raised, and scarce pronounced—Does he yet live? Can he his lost, his dying child forgive? Will God forgive—the Lord who bled—will He?— Ah, no, there is no mercy left for me! Words were but vain, and colours all too faint, That awful moment of despair to paint. She knew me; her exhausted breath, with pain, Drawing, she pressed my hand, and spoke again: By a false guardian's cruel wiles deceived, The tale of fraudful falsehood I believed, And thought thee dead; he gave the stern command, And bade me take the rich Antonio's hand. I knelt, implored, embraced my guardian's knees; Ruthless inquisitor, he held the keys Of the dark torture-house. Trembling for life, Yes, I became a sad, heart-broken wife! Yet curse me not; of every human care Already my full heart has had its share: Abandoned, left in youth to want and woe, Oh! let these tears, that agonising flow, Witness how deep ev'n now my heart is rent! Yet one is lovely—one is innocent! Protect, protect, (and faint in death she smiled) When I am dead, protect my orphan child! The dreadful prison, that so long detained My wasting life, her dying words explained. The wretched priest, who wounded me by stealth, Bartered her love, her innocence for wealth! I laid her bones in earth; the chanted hymn Echoed along the hollow cloister dim; I heard, far off, the bell funereal toll, And sorrowing said: Now peace be with her soul! Far o'er the Western Ocean I conveyed, And Indiana called the orphan maid; Beneath my eye she grew, and, day by day, Seemed, grateful, every kindness to repay. Renouncing Spain, her cruelties and crimes, Amid untutored tribes, in distant climes, 'Twas mine to spread the light of truth, or save From stripes and torture the poor Indian slave. I saw thee, young and innocent, alone, Cast on the mercies of a race unknown; I saw, in dark adversity's cold hour, Thy virtues blooming, like a winter's flower; From chains and slavery I redeemed thy youth, Poured on thy mental sight the beams of truth; By thy warm heart and mild demeanour won, Called thee my other child—my age's son. I need not tell the sequel;—not unmoved Poor Indiana heard thy tale, and loved; Some sympathy a kindred fate might claim; Your years, your fortunes, and your friend the same; Both early of a parent's care bereft, Both strangers in a world of sadness left; I marked each slowly-struggling thought; I shed A tear of love paternal on each head; And, while I saw her timid eyes incline, Blessed the affection that had made her thine! Here let the murmurs of despondence cease: There is a God—believe—and part in peace! Rich hues illumed the track of dying day As the great sun sank in the western bay, And only its last light yet lingering shone, Upon the highest palm-tree's feathery cone; When at a distance on the dewy plain, In mingled group appeared an Indian train; Men, women, children, round Anselmo press, Farewell! they cried. He raised his hand to bless, And said: My children, may the God above Still lead you in the paths of peace and love; To-morrow, we must part;—when I am gone, Raise on this spot a cross, and place a stone, That tribes unborn may some memorial have, When I far off am mouldering in the grave, Of that poor messenger, who tidings bore Of Gospel-mercy to your distant shore. The crowd retired; along the twilight gray, The condor kept its solitary way, The fire-flies shone, when to the hermit's cell Who hastens but the minstrel Zarinel! In foreign lands, far from his native home, 'Twas his, a gay, romantic youth, to roam, With a light cittern o'er his shoulders slung, Where'er he passed he played, and loved, and sung; And thus accomplished, late had joined the train Of gallant soldiers on the southern plain. Father, he cried, uncertain of the fate That may to-morrow's toilsome march await, For long will be the road, I would confess Some secret thoughts that on my bosom press. They are of one I left, an Indian maid, Whose trusting love my careless heart betrayed. Say, may I speak? Say on, the father cried, Nor be to penitence all hope denied. Then hear, Anselmo! From a very child I loved all fancies marvellous and wild; I turned from truth, to listen to the lore Of many an old and fabling troubadour. Thus, with impassioned heart, and wayward mind, To dreams and shapes of shadowy things resigned, I left my native vales and village home, Wide o'er the world a minstrel boy to roam. I never shall forget the day, the hour, When, all my soul resigned to Fancy's power, First, from the snowy Pyrenees, I cast My labouring vision o'er the landscape vast, And saw beneath my feet long vapours float, Streams, mountains, woods, and ocean's mist remote. There once I met a soldier, poor and old, Who tales of Cortes and Bilboa told, And this new world; he spoke of Indian maids, Rivers like seas, and forests whose deep shades Had never yet been pierced by morning ray, And how the green bird mocked, and talked all day. Imagination thus, in colours new, This distant world presented to my view; Young, and enchanted with the fancied scene, I crossed the toiling seas that roared between, And with ideal images impressed, Stood on these unknown shores a wondering guest. Still to romantic phantasies resigned, I left Callao's crowded port behind, And climbed the mountains which their shadow threw Upon the lessening summits of Peru. Some sheep the armed peasants drove before, That all our food through the wild passes bore, Had wandered in the frost-smoke of the morn, Far from the track; I blew the signal horn— But echo only answered: 'mid the snows, Wildered and lost, I saw the evening close. The sun was setting in the crimson west; In all the earth I had no home of rest; The last sad light upon the ice-hills shone; I seemed forsaken in a world unknown; How did my cold and sinking heart rejoice, When, hark! methought I heard a human voice! It might be some wild Indian's roving troop, Or the dread echo of their distant whoop; Still it was human, and I seemed to find Again some commerce with remote mankind. The voice comes nearer, rising through the shade— Is it the song of some rude mountain-maid? And now I heard the tread of hastening feet, And, in the western glen, a Llama bleat. I listened—all is still; but hark! again Near and more near is heard the welcome strain; It is a wild maid's carolling, who seeks Her wandering Llama 'midst the snowy peaks: Truant, she cried, thy lurking place is found! With languid touch I waked the cittern's sound, And soon a maid, by the pale light, I saw Gaze breathless with astonishment and awe: What instant terrors to her fancy rose, Ha! is it not the Spirit of the snows! But when she saw me, weary, cold, and weak, Stretch forth my hand (for now I could not speak), She pitied, raised me from the snows, and led My faltering footsteps to her father's shed; The Llama followed with her tinkling bell; The dwelling rose within a craggy dell, O'erhung with icy summits. To be brief, She was the daughter of an aged chief; He, by her gentle voice to pity won, Showed mercy, for himself had lost a son. The father spoke not; by the pine-wood blaze, The daughter stood, and turned a cake of maize; And then, as sudden shone the light, I saw Such features as no artist hand might draw. Her form, her face, her symmetry, her air, Father! thy age must such recital spare:— She saved my life; and kindness, if not love, Might sure in time the coldest bosom move! Mine was not cold; she loved to hear me sing, And sometimes touched with playful hand the string; And when I waked some melancholy strain, She wept, and smiled, and bade me sing again. So many a happy day, in this deep glen, Far from the noise of life, and sounds of men, Was passed! Nay, father, the sad sequel hear: 'Twas now the leafy spring-time of the year— Ambition called me: true, I knew to part Would break her generous, warm, and trusting heart; True, I had vowed, but now estranged and cold, She saw my look, and shuddered to behold:— She would go with me, leave the lonely glade Where she grew up, but my stern voice forbade; She hid her face and wept: Go then away, (Father, methinks, ev'n now, I hear her say) Go to thy distant land, forget this tear, Forget these rocks, forget I once was dear; Fly to the world, o'er the wide ocean fly, And leave me unremembered here to die! Yet to my father should I all relate, Death, instant death, would be a traitor's fate! Nor fear, nor pity moved my stubborn mind, I left her sorrows and the scene behind; I sought Valdivia on the southern plain, And joined the careless military train; Oh! ere I sleep, thus, lowly on my knee, Father, I absolution crave from thee! Anselmo spoke, with look and voice severe: Yes, thoughtless youth, my absolution hear. First, by deep penitence the wrong atone, Then absolution ask from God alone! Yet stay, and to my warning voice attend, And hear me as a father, and a friend. Let Truth severe be wayward Fancy's guide, Let stern-eyed Conscience o'er each thought preside; The passions, that on noblest natures prey, Oh! cast them, like corroding bonds, away! Disdain to act mean falsehood's coward part, And let religion dignify thine art. If, by thy bed, thou seest at midnight stand Pale Conscience, pointing, with terrific hand, To deeds of darkness done, whilst, like a corse, To shake thy soul, uprises dire Remorse; Fly to God's mercy, fly, ere yet too late— Perhaps one hour marks thy eternal fate; Let the warm tear of deep contrition flow, The heart obdurate melt, like softening snow, The last vain follies of thy youth deplore, Then go, in secret weep, and sin no more; The stars innumerous in their watches shone— Anselmo knelt before the cross alone. Ten thousand glowing orbs their pomp displayed, Whilst, looking up, thus silently he prayed:— Oh! how oppressive to the aching sense, How fearful were this vast magnificence, This prodigality of glory, spread Above a poor and dying emmet's head, That toiled his transient hour upon the shore Of mortal life, and then was seen no more; If man beheld, on his terrific throne, A dark, cold, distant Deity, alone! Felt no relating, no endearing tie, That Hope might upwards raise her glistening eye, And think, with deep unutterable bliss, In yonder radiant realm my kingdom is! More glorious than those orbs that silent roll, Shines Heaven's redeeming mercy on the soul— Oh, pure effulgence of unbounded love! In Thee, I think—I feel—I live—I move; Yet when, O Thou, whose name is Love and Light, When will thy Dayspring on these realms of night Arise! Oh! when shall severed nations raise One hallelujah of triumphant praise, Tibet on Fars, Andes on Atlas call, And “roll the loud hosannah” round the ball! Soon may Thy kingdom come, that love, and peace, And charity, may bid earth's chidings cease! Meantime, in life or death, through good or ill, Thy poor and feeble servant, I fulfil, As best I may, Thy high and holy will, Till, weary, on the world my eyelids close, And I enjoy my long and last repose! CANTO FOURTH. ARGUMENT. Assembly of Indian warriors—Caupolican, Ongolmo, Teucapel, Mountain-chief —Song of the Indian Wizard—White woman and child. Far in the centre of the deepest wood, The assembled fathers of their country stood. 'Twas midnight now; the pine-wood fire burned red, And to the leaves a shadowy glimmer spread; The struggling smoke, or flame with fitful glance, Obscured, or showed, some dreadful countenance; And every warrior, as his club he reared, With larger shadow, indistinct, appeared; While more terrific, his wild locks and mien, And fierce eye, through the quivering smoke, was seen. In sea-wolf's skin, here Mariantu stood; Gnashed his white teeth, impatient, and cried, blood! His lofty brow, with crimson feathers bound, Here, brooding death, the huge Ongolmo frowned; And, like a giant of no earthly race, To his broad shoulders heaved his ponderous mace. With lifted hatchet, as in act to fell, Here stood the young and ardent Teucapel. Like a lone cypress, stately in decay, When time has worn its summer boughs away, And hung its trunk with moss and lichens sere, The Mountain-warrior rested on his spear. And thus, and at this hour, a hundred chiefs, Chosen avengers of their country's griefs; Chiefs of the scattered tribes that roam the plain, That sweeps from Andes to the western main, Their country-gods, around the coiling smoke, With sacrifice, and silent prayers, invoke. For all, at first, were silent as the dead; The pine was heard to whisper o'er their head, So stood the stern assembly; but apart, Wrapped in the spirit of his fearful art, Alone, to hollow sounds of hideous hum, The wizard-seer struck his prophetic drum. Silent they stood, and watched with anxious eyes, What phantom-shape might from the ground arise; No voices came, no spectre-form appeared; A hollow sound, but not of winds, was heard Among the leaves, and distant thunder low, Which seemed like moans of an expiring foe. His crimson feathers quivering in the smoke, Then, with loud voice, first Mariantu spoke: Hail we the omen! Spirits of the slain, I hear your voices! Mourn, devoted Spain! Pale-visaged tyrants! still, along our coasts, Shall we despairing mark your iron hosts! Spirits of our brave fathers, curse the race Who thus your name, your memory disgrace! No; though yon mountain's everlasting snows In vain Almagro's toilsome march oppose; Though Atacama's long and wasteful plain Be heaped with blackening carcases in vain; Though still fresh hosts those snowy summits scale, And scare the Llamas with their glittering mail; Though sullen castles lour along our shore; Though our polluted soil be drenched with gore; Insolent tyrants! we, prepared to die, Your arms, your horses, and your gods, defy! He spoke: the warriors stamped upon the ground, And tore the feathers that their foreheads bound. Insolent tyrants! burst the general cry, We, met for vengeance—we, prepared to die, Your arms, your horses, and your gods, defy! Then Teucapel, with warm emotion, cried: This hatchet never yet in blood was dyed; May it be buried deep within my heart, If living from the conflict I depart, Till loud, from shore to shore, is heard one cry, See! in their gore where the last tyrants lie! The Mountain-warrior: Oh, that I could raise The hatchet too, as in my better days, When victor on Maypocha's banks I stood; And while the indignant river rolled in blood, And our swift arrows hissed like rushing rain, I cleft Almagro's iron helm in twain! My strength is well-nigh gone! years marked with woe Have o'er me passed, and bowed my spirit low! Alas, I have no son! Beloved boy, Thy father's last, best hope, his pride, his joy! Oh, hadst thou lived, sole object of my prayers, To guard my waning life, and these gray hairs, How bravely hadst thou now, in manhood's pride, Swung the uplifted war-club by my side! But the Great Spirit willed not! Thou art gone; And, weary, on this earth I walk alone; Thankful if I may yield my latest breath, And bless my country in the pangs of death! With words deliberate, and uplifted hand, Mild to persuade, yet dauntless to command, Raising his hatchet high, Caupolican Surveyed the assembled chiefs, and thus began: Friends, fathers, brothers, dear and sacred names! Your stern resolve each ardent look proclaims; On then to conquest; let one hope inspire, One spirit animate, one vengeance fire! Who doubts the glorious issue! To our foes A tenfold strength and spirit we oppose. In them no god protects his mortal sons, Or speaks, in thunder, from their roaring guns. Nor come they children of the radiant sky; But, like the wounded snake, to writhe and die. Then, rush resistless on their prostrate bands, Snatch the red lightning from their feeble hands, And swear to the great spirits, hovering near, Who now this awful invocation hear, That we shall never see our household hearth, Till, like the dust, we sweep them from the earth. But vain our strength, that idly, in the fight, Tumultuous wastes its ineffectual might, Unless to one the hatchet we confide; Let one our numbers, one our counsels guide. And, lo! for all that in this world is dear, I raise this hatchet, raise it high, and swear, Never again to lay it down, till we, And all who love this injured land, are free! At once the loud acclaim tumultuous ran: Our spears, our life-blood, for Caupolican! With thee, for all that in this world is dear, We lift our hatchets, lift them high, and swear, Never again to lay them down, till we, And all who love this injured land, are free! Then thus the chosen chief: Bring forth the slave, And let the death-dance recreate the brave. Two warriors led a Spanish captive, bound With thongs; his eyes were fixed upon the ground. Dark cypresses the mournful spot inclose: High in the midst an ancient mound arose, Marked on each side with monumental stones, And white beneath with skulls and scattered bones. Four poniards, on the mound, encircling stood, With points erect, dark with forgotten blood. Forthwith, with louder voice, the chief commands: Bring forth the lots, unbind the captive's hands; Then north, towards his country, turn his face, And dig beneath his feet a narrow space. Caupolican uplifts his axe, and cries: Gods, of our land be yours this sacrifice!— Now, listen, warriors!—and forthwith commands To place the billets in the captive's hands— Soldier, cast in the lot! With looks aghast, The captive in the trench a billet cast. Soldier, declare, who leads the arms of Spain, Where Santiago frowns upon the plain? CAPTIVE. Villagra! WARRIOR. Earth upon the billet heap; So may a tyrant's heart be buried deep! The dark woods echoed to the long acclaim, Accursed be his nation and his name! WARRIOR. Captive, declare who leads the Spanish bands, Where the proud fortress shades Coquimbo's sands. CAPTIVE. Ocampo! WARRIOR. Earth upon the billet heap; So may a tyrant's heart be buried deep! The dark woods echoed to the long acclaim, Accursed be his nation and his name! WARRIOR. Cast in the lot. Again, with looks aghast, The captive in the trench a billet cast. Pronounce his name who here pollutes the plain, The leader of the mailed hosts of Spain! CAPTIVE. Valdivia! At that name a sudden cry Burst forth, and every lance was lifted high. WARRIOR. Valdivia! Earth upon the billet heap; So may a tyrant's heart be buried deep! The dark woods echoed to the long acclaim, Accursed be his nation and his name! And now loud yells, and whoops of death resound; The shuddering captive ghastly gazed around, When the huge war-club smote him to the ground. Again deep stillness hushed the listening crowd, While the prophetic wizard sang aloud. SONG TO THE GOD OF WAR. By thy habitation dread, In the valley of the dead, Where no sun, nor day, nor night, Breaks the red and dusky light; By the grisly troops, that ride, Of slaughtered Spaniards, at thy side,— Slaughtered by the Indian spear, Mighty Epananum, hear! Hark, the battle! Hark, the din! Now the deeds of Death begin! The Spaniards come, in clouds! above, I hear their hoarse artillery move! Spirits of our fathers slain, Haste, pursue the dogs of Spain! The noise was in the northern sky! Haste, pursue! They fly—they fly! Now from the cavern's secret cell, Where the direst phantoms dwell, See they rush, and, riding high, Break the moonlight as they fly; And, on the shadowed plain beneath, Shoot, unseen, the shafts of Death! O'er the devoted Spanish camp, Like a vapour, dark and damp, May they hover, till the plain Is hid beneath the countless slain; And none but silent women tread From corse to corse, to seek the dead! The wavering fire flashed with expiring light, When shrill and hollow, through the cope of night, A distant shout was heard; at intervals, Increasing on the listening ear it falls. It ceased; when, bursting from the thickest wood, With lifted axe, two gloomy warriors stood; Wan in the midst, with dark and streaming hair, Blown by the winds upon her bosom bare, A woman, faint from terror's wild alarms, And folding a white infant in her arms, Appeared. Each warrior stooped his lance to gaze On her pale looks, seen ghastlier through the blaze. Save! she exclaimed, with harrowed aspect wild; Oh, save my innocent, my helpless child! Then fainting fell, as from death's instant stroke; Caupolican, with stern inquiry, spoke: Whence come, to interrupt our awful rite, At this dread hour, the warriors of the night? From ocean. Who is she who fainting lies, And now scarce lifts her supplicating eyes? The Spanish ship went down; the seamen bore, In a small boat, this woman to the shore: They fell beneath our hatchets,—and again, We gave them back to the insulted main. The child and woman—of a race we hate— Warriors, 'tis yours, here to decide their fate. Vengeance! aloud fierce Mariantu cried: Let vengeance on the race be satisfied! Let none of hated Spanish blood remain, Woman or child, to violate our plain! Amid that dark and bloody scene, the child Stretched to the mountain-chief his hands and smiled. A starting tear of pity dimmed the eye Of the old warrior, though he knew not why. Oh, think upon your little ones! he cried, Nor be compassion to the weak denied. Caupolican then fixed his aspect mild On the white woman and her shrinking child, Then firmly spoke:— White woman, we were free, When first thy brethren of the distant sea Came to our shores! White woman, theirs the guilt! Theirs, if the blood of innocence be spilt! Yet blood we seek not, though our arms oppose The hate of foreign and remorseless foes; Thou camest here a captive, so abide, Till the Great Spirit shall our cause decide. He spoke: the warriors of the night obey; And, ere the earliest streak of dawning day, They lead her from the scene of blood away. CANTO FIFTH. ARGUMENT. Ocean Cave—Spanish Captive—Wild Indian Maid—Genius of Andes, and Spirits. 'Tis dawn:—the distant Andes' rocky spires, One after one, have caught the orient fires. Where the dun condor shoots his upward flight, His wings are touched with momentary light. Meantime, beneath the mountains' glittering heads, A boundless ocean of gray vapour spreads, That o'er the champaign, stretching far below, Moves now, in clustered masses, rising slow, Till all the living landscape is displayed In various pomp of colour, light, and shade, Hills, forests, rivers, lakes, and level plain, Lessening in sunshine to the southern main. The Llama's fleece fumes with ascending dew; The gem-like humming-birds their toils renew; And there, by the wild river's devious side, The tall flamingo, in its crimson pride, Stalks on, in richest plumage bright arrayed, With snowy neck superb, and legs of lengthening shade. Sad maid, for others may the valleys ring, For other ears the birds of morning sing; For other eyes the palms in beauty wave, Dark is thy prison in the ocean-cave! Amid that winding cavern's inmost shade, A dripping rill its ceaseless murmur made: Masses of dim-discovered crags aloof, Hung, threatening, from the vast and vaulted roof: And through a fissure, in its glimmering height, Seen like a star, appeared the distant light; Beneath the opening, where the sunbeams shine, Far down, the rock-weed hung its slender twine. Here, pale and bound, the Spanish captive lay, Till morn on morn, in silence, passed away; When once, as o'er her sleeping child she hung, And sad her evening supplication sung; Like a small gem, amidst the gloom of night, A glow-worm shot its green and trembling light,— And, 'mid the moss and craggy fragments, shed Faint lustre o'er her sleeping infant's head; And hark! a voice—a woman's voice, its sound Dies in faint echoes, 'mid the vault profound: Let us pity the poor white maid! She has no mother near! No friend to dry her tear! Upon the cold earth she is laid: Let us pity the poor white maid! It seemed the burden of a song of woe; And see, across the gloom an Indian girl move slow! Her nearer look is sorrowful, yet mild, Her hanging locks are wreathed with rock-weed wild; Gently she spoke, Poor Christian, dry thy tear: Art thou afraid? all are not cruel here. Oh! still more wretched may my portion be, Stranger, if I could injure thine and thee! And, lo! I bring, from banks and thickets wild, Wood-strawberries, and honey for thy child. Whence, who art thou, who, in this fearful place, Does comfort speak to one of Spanish race? INDIAN. It is an Indian maid, who chanced to hear Thy tale of sorrow, as she wandered near: I loved a white man once; but he is flown, And now I wander heartless and alone. I traced the dark and winding way beneath: But well I know to lead thee hence were death. Oh, say! what fortunes cast thee o'er the wave, On these sad shores perhaps to find a grave? SPANISH WOMAN. Three years have passed since a fond husband left Me and this infant, of his love bereft; Him I have followed; need I tell thee more, Cast helpless, friendless, hopeless, on this shore. INDIAN. Oh! did he love thee, then? Let death betide, Yes, from this cavern I will be thy guide. Nay, do not shrink! from Caracalla's bay, Ev'n now, the Spaniards wind their march this way. As late in yester eve I paced the shore I heard their signal-guns at distance roar. Wilt thou not follow? He will shield thy child,— The Christian's God,—through passes dark and wild He will direct thy way! Come, follow me; Oh, yet be loved, be happy, and be free! But I, an outcast on my native plain, The poor Olola ne'er shall smile again! So guiding from the cave, when all was still, And pointing to the furthest glimmering hill, The Indian led, till, on Itata's side, The Spanish camp and night-fires they descried: Then on the stranger's neck that wild maid fell, And said, Thy own gods prosper thee, farewell! The owl is hooting overhead; below, On dusky wing, the vampire-bat sails slow. Ongolmo stood before the cave of night, Where the great wizard sat:—a lurid light Was on his face; twelve giant shadows frowned, His mute and dreadful ministers, around. Each eye-ball, as in life, was seen to roll, Each lip to move; but not a living soul Was there, save bold Ongolmo and the seer. The warrior half advanced his lifted spear, Then spoke: Dread master of the mighty lore! Say, shall the Spaniards welter in their gore? Let these dark ministers the answer tell, Replied the master of the mighty spell. Then every giant-shadow, as it stood, Lifted on high a skull that dropped with blood. Yet more, the impatient warrior cried; yet more! Say, shall I live, and drink the tyrant's gore? 'Twas silence. Speak! he cried: none made reply. At once strange thunder shook the distant sky, And all was o'er; the grisly shapes are flown, And the grim warrior stands in the wild woods alone. St Pedro's church had rung its midnight chimes, And the gray friars were chanting at their primes, When winds, as of a rushing hurricane, Shook the tall windows of the towered fane;— Sounds more than earthly with the storm arose, And a dire troop are passed to Andes' snows, Where mighty spirits in mysterious ring Their dread prophetic incantations sing, Round Chillan's crater-smoke, whose lurid light Streams high against the hollow cope of night. Thy genius, Andes, towering o'er the rest, Rose vast, and thus a phantom-shape addressed: Who comes so swift amid the storm? Ha! I know thy bloodless form, I know thee, angel, who thou art, By the hissing of thy dart! 'Tis Death, the king! the rocks around, Hark! echo back the fearful sound;— 'Tis Death, the king! away, away! The famished vulture scents its prey. Spectre, hence! we cannot die— Thy withering weapons we defy; Dire and potent as thou art! Then spoke the phantom of the uplifted dart: Spirits who in darkness dwell, I heard far off your secret spell! Enough, on yonder fatal shore, My fiends have drank your children's gore; Lo! I come, and doom to fate The murderers, and the foe you hate! Of all who shook their hostile spears, And marked their way through blood and tears, (Now sleeping still on yonder plain) But one—one only shall remain, Ere thrice the morn shall shine again. Then sang the mighty spirits. Thee, they sing, Hail to thee, Death, all hail to Death, the king! The penguin flaps her wings in gore, Devoted Spain, along the shore. Whence that shriek? with ghastly eyes, Thy victor-chief abandoned lies! Victor of the southern world, Whose crimson banners were unfurled O'er the silence of the waves,— O'er a land of bleeding slaves! Victor, where is now thy boast; Thine iron steeds, thy mailed host? Hark! hark! even now I hear his cries!— Spirits, hence!—he dies! he dies! CANTO SIXTH. ARGUMENT. The City of Conception—The City of Penco—Castle—Lautaro—Wild Indian Maid—Zarinel—Missionary. The second moon had now begun to wane, Since bold Valdivia left the southern plain; Goal of his labours, Penco's port and bay, Far gleaming to the summer sunset lay. The wayworn veteran, who had slowly passed Through trackless woods, or o'er savannahs vast, With hope impatient sees the city spires Gild the horizon, like ascending fires. Now well-known sounds salute him, as more near The citadel and battlements appear; The approaching trumpets ring at intervals; The trumpet answers from the rampart walls, Where many a maiden casts an anxious eye, Some long-lost object of her love to espy, Or watches, as the evening light illumes The points of lances, or the passing plumes. The grating drawbridge and the portal-arch, Now echo to the long battalion's march; Whilst every eye some friend remembered greets, Amid the gazing crowd that throngs the streets. As bending o'er his mule, amid the throng, Pensive and pale, Anselmo rode along, How sacred, 'mid the noise of arms, appeared His venerable mien and snowy beard! Whilst every heart a silent prayer bestowed, Slow to the convent's massy gate he rode: Around, the brothers, gratulating, stand, And ask for tidings of the southern land. As from the turret tolls the vesper bell, He seeks, a weary man, his evening cell. No sounds of social cheer, no beds of state, Nor gorgeous canopies his coming wait; But o'er a little bread, with folded hands, Thanking the God that gave, a while he stands; Then, while all thoughts of earthly sorrow cease, Upon his pallet lays him down in peace. The scene how different, where the castle-hall Rings to the loud triumphant festival: A hundred torches blaze, and flame aloof, Long quivering shadows streak the vaulted roof,— Whilst, seen far off, the illumined windows throw A splendour on the shore and seas below. Amid his captains, in imperial state, Beneath a crimson canopy, elate, Valdivia sits—and, striking loud the strings, The wandering ministrel of Valentia sings. For Chili conquered, fill the bowl again! For Chili conquered, raise the heroic strain! Lautaro left the hall of jubilee Unmarked, and wandered by the moonlit sea: He heard far off, in dissonant acclaim, The song, the shout, and his loved country's name. As swelled at times the trump's insulting sound, He raised his eyes impatient from the ground; Then smote his breast indignantly, and cried, Chili! my country; would that I had died On the sad night of that eventful day When on the ground my murdered father lay! I should not then, dejected and alone, Have thought I heard his injured spirit groan. Ha! was it not his form—his face—his hair? Hold, soldier! stern, inhuman soldier, spare! Ha! is it not his blood? Avenge, he cries, Avenge, my son, these wounds! He faints—he dies! Leave me, dread shadow! Can I then forget My father's look—his voice? He beckons yet! Now on that glimmering rock I see him stand: Avenge! he cries, and waves his dim-seen hand! Thus mused the youth, distempered and forlorn, When, hark! the sound as of a distant horn Swells o'er the surge! he turned his look around, And still, with many a pause, he heard the sound: It came from yonder rocks; and, list! what strain Breaks on the silence of the sleeping main? I heard the song of gladness: It seemed but yesterday, But it turned my thoughts to madness, So soon it died away: I sound my sea-shell; but in vain I try To bring back that enchanting harmony! Hark! heard ye not the surges say, Oh! heartless maid, what canst thou do? O'er the moon-gleaming ocean, I'll wander away, And paddle to Spain in my light canoe! The youth drew near, by the strange accents led, Where in a cave, wild sea-weeds round her head, And holding a large sea-conch in her hand, He saw, with wildering air, an Indian maiden stand. A tattered poncho o'er her shoulders hung; On either side her long black locks were flung; And now by the moon's glimmer, he espies Her high cheek-bones, and bright but hollow eyes. Lautaro spoke: Oh! say what cruel wrong Weighs on thy heart, maiden, what bodes thy song? She answered not, but blew her shell again; Then thus renewed the desultory strain: Yes, yes, we must forget! the world is wide; My music now shall be the dashing tide: In the calm of the deep I will frolic and swim— With the breath of the South o'er the sea-blossom skim. If ever, stranger, on thy way, Sounds, more than earthly sweet, thy soul should move, It is the youth! Oh! do not say— That poor Olola died for love. Lautaro stretched his hand; she said, Adieu! And o'er the glimmering rocks like lightning flew. He followed, and still heard at distance swell The lessening echoes of that mournful shell. It ceased at once; and now he heard no more Than the sea's murmur dying on the shore. Olola!—ha! his sister had that name! Oh, horrid fancies! shake not thus his frame! All night he wandered by the desert main, To catch the melancholy sounds again. No torches blaze in Penco's castled hall That echoed to the midnight festival. The weary soldiers by their toils oppressed, Had now retired to silence and to rest. The minstrel only, who the song had sung Of noble Cid, as o'er the strings he hung, Upon the instrument had fall'n asleep, Weary, and now was hushed in slumbers deep. Tracing the scenes long past, in busy dreams Again he wanders by his native streams; Or sits, his evening saraband to sing To the clear Garonne's gentle murmuring. Cold o'er the fleckered clouds the morning broke Aslant ere from his slumbers he awoke; Still as he sat, nor yet had left the place, The first dim light fell on his pallid face. He wakes—he gazes round—the dawning day Comes from the deep, in garb of cloudy gray. The woods with crow of early turkeys ring, The glancing birds beneath the castle sing, And the sole sun his rising orb displays, Radiant and reddening, through the scattered haze. To recreate the languid sense a while, When earth and ocean wore their sweetest smile, He wandered to the beach: the early air Blew soft, and lifted, as it blew, his hair; Flushed was his cheek; his faded eye, more bright, Shone with a faint but animated light, While the soft morning ray seemed to bestow On his tired mind a transient kindred glow. As thus, with shadow stretching o'er the sand, He mused and wandered on the winding strand, At distance tossed upon the tumbling tide, A dark and floating substance he espied. He stood, and where the eddying surges beat, An Indian corse was rolled beneath his feet: The hollow wave retired with sullen sound; The face of that sad corse was to the ground; It seemed a female, by the slender form; He touched the hand—it was no longer warm; He turned its face—O God! that eye, though dim, Seemed with its deadly glare as fixed on him! How sunk his shuddering sense, how changed his hue, When poor Olola in that corse he knew! Lautaro, rushing from the rocks, advanced; His keen eye, like a startled eagle's glanced: 'Tis she!—he knew her by a mark impressed From earliest infancy beneath her breast. Oh, my poor sister! when all hopes were past Of meeting, do we meet—thus meet—at last! Then full on Zarinel, as one amazed, With rising wrath and stern suspicion gazed; For Zarinel still knelt upon the sand, And to his forehead pressed the dead maid's hand. Speak! whence art thou? Pale Zarinel, his head Upraising answered, Peace is with the dead! Him dost thou seek who injured thine and thee? Here—strike the fell assassin—I am he! Die! he exclaimed, and with convulsive start Instant had plunged the dagger in his heart, When the meek father, with his holy book, And placid aspect, met his frenzied look. He trembled—struck his brow—and, turning round, Flung the uplifted dagger to the ground. Then murmured: Father, Heaven has heard thy prayer— But oh! the sister of my soul lies there! The Christian's God has triumphed! father, heap Some earth upon her bones, whilst I go weep! Anselmo with calm brow approached the place, And hastened with his staff his faltering pace: Ho! child of guilt and wretchedness, he cried, Speak!—Holy father, the sad youth replied, God bade the seas the accusing victim roll Dead at my feet, to teach my shuddering soul Its guilt: Oh! father, holy father, pray That heaven may take the deep, dire curse away! Oh! yet, Anselmo cried, live and repent, For not in vain was this dread warning sent; The deep reproaches of thy soul I spare, Go! seek Heaven's peace by penitence and prayer. The youth arose, yet trembling from the shock, And severed from the dead maid's hair a lock; This to his heart with trembling hand he pressed, And dried the salt-sea moisture on his breast. They laid her limbs within the sea-beat grave, And prayed: Her soul, O blessed Mary, save! CANTO SEVENTH. ARGUMENT. Midnight—Valdivia's tent—Missionary—March to the Valley Arauco—First sight of assembled Indians. The watchman on the tower his bugle blew, And swelling to the morn the streamers flew; The rampart-guns a dread alarum gave, Smoke rolled, and thunder echoed o'er the wave; When, starting from his couch, Valdivia cried, What tidings? Of the tribes! a scout replied; Ev'n now, prepared thy bulwarks to assail, Their gathering numbers darken all the vale! Valdivia called to the attendant youth, Philip, he cried, belike thy words have truth; The formidable host, by holy James, Might well appal our priests and city dames! Dost thou not fear? Nay—dost thou not reply? Now by the rood, and all the saints on high, I hold it sin that thou shouldst lift thy hand Against thy brothers in thy native land! But, as thou saidst, those mighty enemies Me and my feeble legions would despise. Yes, by our holy lady, thou shalt ride, Spectator of their prowess, by my side! Come life, come death, our battle shall display Its ensigns to the earliest beam of day! With louder summons ring the rampart-bell, And haste the shriving father from his cell; A soldier's heart rejoices in alarms: And let the trump at midnight sound to arms! And now, obedient to the chief's commands, The gray-haired priest before the soldier stands. Father, Valdivia cried, fierce are our foes,— The last event of war God only knows;— Let mass be sung; father, this very night I would attend the high and holy rite. Yet deem not that I doubt of victory, Or place defeat or death before mine eye; It blenches not! But, whatsoe'er befall, Good father, I would part in peace with all. So, tell Lautaro—his ingenuous mind Perhaps may grieve, if late I seemed unkind:— Hear my heart speak, though far from virtue's way Ambition's lure hath led my steps astray, No wanton exercise of barbarous power Harrows my shrinking conscience at this hour. If hasty passions oft my spirit fire, They flash a moment and the next expire; Lautaro knows it. There is somewhat more: I would not, here—here, on this distant shore (Should they, the Indian multitudes, prevail, And this good sword and these firm sinews fail) Amid my deadly enemies be found, “Unhouseled, ananealed,” upon the ground, A dying man;—thy look, thy reverend age, Might save my poor remains from barb'rous rage; And thou may'st pay the last sad obsequies, O'er the heaped earth where a brave soldier lies:— So God be with thee! By the torches' light, The slow procession moves; the solemn rite Is chanted: through the aisles and arches dim, At intervals, is heard the imploring hymn. Now all is still, that only you might hear— (The tall and slender tapers burning clear, Whose light Anselmo's palid brow illumes, Now glances on the mailed soldier's plumes) Hear, sounding far, only the iron tread, That echoed through the cloisters of the dead. Dark clouds are wandering o'er the heaven's wide way; Now from the camp, at times, a horse's neigh Breaks on the ear; and on the rampart height The sentinel proclaims the middle watch of night. By the dim taper's solitary ray, Tired, in his tent, the sovereign soldier lay. Meantime, as shadowy dreams arise, he roams 'Mid bright pavilions and imperial domes, Where terraces, and battlements, and towers, Glisten in air o'er rich romantic bowers. Sudden the visionary pomp is past; The vacant court sounds to the moaning blast; A dismal vault appears, where, with swoll'n eyes, As starting from their orbs, a dead man lies. It is Almagro's corse!—roll on, ye drums, Lo! where the great, the proud Pizarro comes! Her gold, her richest gems, let Fortune strew Before the mighty conqueror of Peru! Ah, turn, and see a dagger in his hand— With ghastly look—see the assassin stand! Pizarro falls;—he welters in his gore! Lord of the western world, art thou no more! Valdivia, hark!—it was another groan! Another shadow comes, it is thy own! Ah, bind not thus his arms!—give, give him breath! Wipe from his bleeding brow those damps of death! Valdivia, starting, woke. He is alone: The taper in his tent yet dimly shone. Lautaro, haste! he cried; Lautaro, save Thy dying master! Ah! is this the brave, The haughty victor? Hush, the dream is past! The early trumpets ring the second blast! Arm, arm! Ev'n now, the impatient charger neighs! Again, from tent to tent the trumpet brays! By torch-light, then, Valdivia gave command, Haste, let Del Oro take a chosen band, With watchful caution, on his fleetest steed, A troop observant on the heights to lead. Now beautiful, beneath the heaven's gray arch, Appeared the main battalion's moving march; The banner of the cross was borne before, And next, with aspect sad, and tresses hoar, The holy man went thoughtfully and pressed A crucifix, in silence, to his breast. Valdivia, all in burnished steel arrayed, Upon whose crest the morn's effulgence played, Majestic reined his steed, and seemed alone, Worthy the southern world's imperial throne. His features through the barred casque that glow, His pole-axe pendent from the saddle-bow; His dazzling armour, and the glitter bright Of his drawn sabre, in the orient light, Speak him not, now, for knightly tournament Arrayed, but on emprise of prowess bent, And deeds of deadly strife. In blooming pride, The attendant youth rode, pensive, by his side. Their pennoned lances, waving in the wind, Two hundred clanking horsemen tramped behind, In iron harness clad. The bugles blew, And high in air the sanguine ensigns flew. The arbalasters next, with cross-bows slung, Marched, whilst the plumed Moors their cymbals swung. Auxiliar Indians here, a various train, With spears and bows, darkened the distant plain; Drums rolled, and fifes re-echoed shrill and clear, At intervals, as near and yet more near, While flags and intermingled halberds shine, The long batallion drew its passing line. Last rolled the heavy guns, a sable tier, By Indians drawn, with matchmen in the rear; And many a straggling mule and sumpter-train Closed the embattled order on the plain, Till nought beneath the azure sky appears But the projecting points of scarce-discovered spears, Slow up the hill, with floating vapours hoar, Or by the blue lake's long retiring shore, Now seen distinct, through the disparting haze, The glittering file its bannered length displays; Now winding from the woods, again appears The moving line of matchlocks and of spears, Part seen, part lost; the long illustrious march Circling the swamp, now draws its various arch; And seems, as on it moves, meandering slow, A radiant segment of a living bow. Five days the Spaniards, trooping in array, O'er plains and headlands, held their eastern way. On the sixth early dawn, with shuddering awe And horror, in the last defile they saw Ten pendent heads, from which the gore still run, All gashed, and grim, and blackening in the sun. These were the gallant troop that passed before, The Indians' vast encampment to explore, Led by Del Oro, now with many a wound Pierced, and a headless trunk upon the ground. The horses startled, as they tramped in blood; The troops a moment half-recoiling stood. But boots not now to pause, or to retire; Valdivia's eye flashed with indignant fire: Follow! he cried, brave comrades, to the hill! And instant shouts the pealing valley fill. And now, up to the hill's ascending crest, With animated look and beating breast, He urged his steed; when, wide beneath his eye, He saw, in long expanse, Arauco's valley lie. Far as the labouring sight could stretch its glance, One undulating mass of club and lance, One animated surface seemed to fill The many-stirring scene from hill to hill: To the deep mass he pointed with his sword, Banner, advance! give out “Castile!” the word. Instant the files advance, the trumpets bray, And now the host in terrible array, Ranged on the heights that overlook the plain, Has halted! But the task were long and vain To tell what nations, from the seas that roar Round Patagonia's melancholy shore; From forests, brown with everlasting shades; From rocks of sunshine, white with prone cascades; From snowy summits, where the Llama roams, Oft bending o'er the cataract as it foams; From streams whose bridges tremble from the steep; From lakes, in summer's sweetest light asleep; Indians, of sullen brow and giant limb, With clubs terrific, and with aspects grim, Flocked fearless. When they saw the Spanish line Arrayed, and front to front, descending shine, Burst, instant burst, the universal cry, (Ten thousand spears uplifted to the sky)— Tyrants, we come to conquer or to die! Grim Mariantu led the Indian force A-left; and, rushing to the foremost horse, Hurled with unerring aim the involving thong, Then fearless sprang amidst the mailed throng. Valdivia saw the horse, entangled, reel, And shouting, as he rode, Castile! Castile! Led on the charge: like a descending flood, It swept, till every spur was black with blood. His force a-right, where Harratomac led, A thousand spears went hissing overhead, And feathered arrows, of each varying hue, In glancing arch, beneath the sunbeams flew. Dire was the strife, when ardent Teucapel Advancing in the front of carnage fell. At once, Ongolmo, Elicura, rushed, And swaying their huge clubs together, crushed Horseman and horse; then bathed their hands in gore, And limb from limb the panting carcase tore. Caupolican, where the main battle bleeds, Hosts and succeeding hosts undaunted leads, Till, torn and shattered by the ceaseless fire, Thousands, with gnashing teeth, and clenched spears, expire. Pierced by a hundred wounds, Ongolmo lies, And grasps his club terrific as he dies. With breathless expectation, on the height, Lautaro watched the long and dubious fight: Pale and resigned the meek man stood, and pressed More close the holy image to his breast. Now nearer to the fight Lautaro drew, When on the ground a warrior met his view, Upon whose features memory seemed to trace A faint resemblance of his father's face; O'er him a horseman, with collected might, Raised his uplifted sword, in act to smite, When the youth springing on, without a word, Snatched from a soldier's wearied grasp his sword, And smote the horseman through the crest: a yell Of triumph burst, as to the ground he fell. Lautora shouted, On! brave brothers, on! Scatter them like the snow!—the day is won! Lo, I! Lautora,—Attacapac's son! The Indians turn: again the battle bleeds, Cleft are the helms and crushed the struggling steeds. The bugle sounds, and faint with toil and heat, Some straggling horsemen to the hills retreat. Stand, brave companions! bold Valdivia cried, And shook his sword, in recent carnage dyed; Oh! droop not—droop not yet—all is not o'er— Brave, faithful friends, one glorious sally more. Where is Lautaro! leaps his willing sword Now to avenge his long-indulgent lord! He waited not for answer, but again Spurred to the centre of the horrid plain. Clubs, arrows, spears, the spot of death inclose, And fainter now the Spanish shouts arose. 'Mid ghastly heaps of many a bleeding corse, Lies the caparisoned and dying horse. While still the rushing multitudes assail, Vain is the fiery tube, the twisted mail! The Spanish horsemen faint; long yells resound, As the dragged ensign trails the gory ground: Shout, for the chief is seized!—a thousand cries Burst forth—Valdivia! for the sacrifice! And lo, in silent dignity resigned, The meek Anselmo, led in bonds, behind! His hand upon his breast, young Zarinel Amidst a group of mangled Indians fell; The spear that to his heart a passage found Left poor Olola's hair within the wound. Now all is hushed, save where, at times, alone, Deep midnight listens to a distant moan; Save where the condors clamour, overhead, And strike with sounding beaks the helmets of the dead. CANTO EIGHTH. ARGUMENT. Indian festival for victory—Old Warrior brought in wounded—Recognises his long-lost son, and dies—Discovery—Conclusion with the Old Warrior's funeral, and prophetic oration by the Missionary. The morn returns, and, reddening, seems to shed One ray of glory on the patriot-dead. Round the dark stone, the victor-chiefs behold! Still on their locks the gouts of gore hang cold! There stands the brave Caupolican, the pride Of Chili, young Lautaro, by his side! Near the grim circle, pendent from the wood, Twelve hundred Spanish heads are dripping blood. Shrill sound the notes of death: in festive dance, The Indian maids with myrtle boughs advance; The tinkling sea-shells on their ancles ring, As, hailing thus the victor-youth, they sing:— SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS. Oh, shout for Lautaro, the young and the brave! The arm of whose strength was uplifted to save, When the steeds of the strangers came rushing amain, And the ghosts of our fathers looked down on the slain! 'Twas eve, and the noise of the battle was o'er, Five thousand brave warriors were cold in their gore; When, in front, young Lautaro invincible stood, And the horses and iron-men rolled in their blood! As the snows of the mountain are swept by the blast, The earthquake of death o'er the white men has passed; Shout, Chili, in triumph! the battle is won, And we dance round the heads that are black in the sun! Lautaro, as if wrapt in thought profound, Oft turned an anxious look inquiring round. He is not here!—Say, does my father live? Ere eager voices could an answer give, With faltering footsteps and declining head, And slowly by an aged Indian led, Wounded and weak the mountain chief appears: Live, live! Lautaro cried, with bursting tears, And fell upon his neck, and, kissing, pressed, With folding arms, his gray hairs to his breast. Oh, live! I am thy son—thy long-lost child! The warrior raised his look, and faintly smiled; Chili, my country, is avenged! he cried: My son!—then sunk upon a shield—and died. Lautaro knelt beside him, as he bowed, And kissed his bleeding breast, and wept aloud. The sounds of sadness through the circle ran, When thus, with lifted axe, Caupolican: What, for our fathers, brothers, children, slain, Canst thou repay, ruthless, inhuman Spain? Here, on the scene with recent slaughter red, To sooth the spirits of the brave who bled, Raise we, to-day, the war-feast of the dead. Bring forth the chief in bonds! Fathers, to-day Devote we to our gods the noblest prey! Lautaro turned his eyes, and, gazing round, Beheld Valdivia and Anselmo bound! One stood in arms, as with a stern despair, His helmet cleft in twain, his temples bare, Where streaks of blood that dropped upon his mail, Served but to show his face more deadly pale: His eyebrows, dark and resolute, he bent, And stood, composed, to wait the dire event. Still on the cross his looks Anselmo cast, As if all thought of this vain world was passed, And in a world of light, without a shade, Ev'n now his meek and guileless spirit strayed. Where stood the Spanish chief, a muttering sound Rose, and each club was lifted from the ground; When, starting from his father's corse, his sword Waving before his once-triumphant lord, Lautaro cried, My breast shall meet the blow: But save—save him, to whom my life I owe! Valdivia marked him with unmoving eye, Then looked upon his bonds, nor deigned reply; When Harratomac, stealing with slow pace, And lifting high his iron-jagged mace, Smote him to earth; a thousand voices rose, Mingled with shouts and yells, So fall our foes! Lautaro gave to tears a moment's space, As black in death he marked Valdivia's face, Then cried—Chiefs, friends, and thou, Caupolican, Oh, spare this innocent and holy man! He never sailed, rapacious, o'er the deep, The gold of blood-polluted lands to heap; He never gave the armed hosts his aid, But meekly to the Mighty Spirit prayed, That in all lands the sounds of woe might cease, And brothers of the wide world dwell in peace! The victor-youth saw generous sympathy Already steal to every warrior's eye; Then thus again: Oh, if this filial tear Bear witness my own father was most dear; If this uplifted arm, this bleeding steel Speak for my country what I felt and feel; If, at this hour, I meet her high applause, While my heart beats still ardent in her cause;— Hear, and forgive these tears that grateful flow, Oh! hear, how much to this poor man I owe! I was a child—when to my sire's abode, In Chillan's vale, the armed horsemen rode: Me, whilst my father cold and breathless lay, Far off the crested soldiers bore away, And for a captive sold. No friend was near, To mark a young and orphan stranger's tear! This humble man, with kind parental care, Snatched me from slavery—saved from dark despair; And as my years increased, protected, fed, And breathed a father's blessings on my head. A Spanish maid was with him: need I speak? Behold, affection's tear still wets my cheek! Years, as they passed, matured in ripening grace Her form unfolding, and her beauteous face: She heard my orphan tale; she loved to hear, And sometimes for my fortunes dropped a tear. I could have bowed to direst ills resigned, But wept at looks so sweet, at words so kind. Valdivia saw me, now in blooming age, And claimed me from the father as his page; The chief too cherished me, yea, saved my life, When in Peru arose the civil strife. Yet still remembering her I loved so well, Oft I returned to the gray father's cell: His voice instructed me; recalled my youth From rude idolatry to heavenly truth: Of this hereafter; he my darkling mind Cleared, and from low and sensual thoughts refined. Then first, with feelings new impressed, I strove To hide the tear of tenderness and love: Amid the fairest maidens of Peru, My eyes, my heart, one only object knew: I lived that object's love and faith to share; He saw, and blessed us with a father's prayer. Here, at Valdivia's last and stern command, I came, a stranger in my native land! Anselmo (so him call—now most in need— And standing here in bonds, for whom I plead) Came, by our chief so summoned, and for aid To the Great Spirit of the Christians prayed: Here as a son I loved him, but I left A wife, a child, of my fond cares bereft, Never to see again; for death awaits My entrance now in Lima's jealous gates. Caupolican, didst thou thy father love? Did his last dying look affection move? Pity this aged man; unbend thy brow: He was my father—is my father, now! Consenting mercy marks each warrior's mien. But who is this, what pallid form is seen, As crushed already by the fatal blow, Bound, and with looks white as a wreath of snow, Her hands upon her breast, scarce drawn her breath, A Spanish woman knelt, expecting death, Whilst, borne by a dark warrior at her side, An infant shrunk from the red plumes, and cried! Lautaro started: Injured maid of Spain! Me!—me! oh, take me to thine arms again! She heard his voice, and, by the scene oppressed, With one faint sigh fell senseless on his breast. Caupolican, with warm emotion, cried, Live, live! Lautaro and his beauteous bride! Live, aged father!—and forthwith commands A warrior to unbind Anselmo's hands. She raised her head: his eyes first met her view, As round Lautaro's neck her arms she threw, Ah, no! she feebly spoke; it is not true! It is some form of the distempered brain! Then hid her face upon his breast again. Dark flashing eyes, terrific, glared around: Here, his brains scattered by the deadly wound, The Spanish chief lay on the gory ground. With lowering brows, and mace yet drooping blood, And clotted hair, there Mariantu stood. Anselmo here, sad, yet in sorrow mild, Appeared: she cried, A blessing on your child, And knelt, as slow revived her waking sense, And then, with looks aghast, Oh bear us hence! Now all the assembled chiefs, assenting, cried, Live, live! Lautaro and his beauteous bride! With eager arms Lautaro snatched his boy, And kissed him in an agony of joy; Then to Anselmo gave, who strove to speak, And felt the tear first burning on his cheek: The infant held his neck with strict embrace, And kissed his pale emaciated face. From the dread scene, wet with Valdivia's gore, His wan and trembling charge Lautaro bore. There was a bank, where slept the summer-light, A small stream whispering went in mazes bright, And stealing from the sea, the western wind Waved the magnolias on the slope inclined: The woodpecker, in glittering plumage green, And echoing bill, beneath the boughs was seen; And, arched with gay and pendent flowers above, The floripondio its rich trellis wove. Lautaro bent, with looks of love and joy, O'er his yet trembling wife and beauteous boy: Oh, by what miracle, beloved! say, Hast thou escaped the perils of the way From Lima, where our humble dwelling stood, To these tumultuous scenes, this vale of blood? Roused by his voice, as from the sleep of death, Faint she replied, with slow-recovering breath, Who shall express, when thou, best friend! wert gone, How sunk my heart!—deserted and alone! Would I were with thee! oft I sat and sighed, When the pale moon shone on the silent tide— At length resolved, I sought thee o'er the seas: The brave bark cheer'ly went before the breeze, That arms and soldiers to Valdivia bore, From Lima bound to Chili's southern shore: I seized the fair occasion—ocean smiled, As to the sire I bore his lisping child. The storm arose: with loud and sudden shock The vessel sunk, disparting on a rock. Some mariners, amidst the billows wild, Scarce saved, in one small boat, me and my child. What I have borne, a captive since that day— Forgive these tears—I scarce have heart to say! None pitied, save one gentle Indian maid— A wild maid—of her looks I was afraid; Her long black hair upon her shoulders fell, And in her hand she bore a wreathed shell. Lautaro for a moment turned aside, And, Oh, my sister! with faint voice he cried. Already free from sorrow and alarms, I clasped in thought a husband in my arms, When a dark warrior, stationed on the height, Who held his solitary watch by night, Before me stood, and lifting high his lance, Exclaimed: No further, on thy life, advance! Faint, wearied, sinking to the earth with dread, Back to the dismal cave my steps he led. Only at eve, within the craggy cleft, Some water, and a cake of maize, were left. The thirteenth sun unseen went down the sky; When morning came, they brought me forth to die; But hushed be every sigh, each boding fear, Since all I sought on earth, and all I love, is here! Her infant raised his hands, with glistening eye, To reach a large and radiant butterfly, That fluttered near his face; with looks of love, And truth and tenderness, Lautaro strove To calm her wounded heart; the holy sire, His eyes faint-lighted with a transient fire, Hung o'er them, and to Heaven his prayer addressed, While, with uplifted hands, he wept and blest. An aged Indian came, with feathers crowned, And knelt before Lautaro on the ground. What tidings, Indian? INDIAN. When I led thy sire, Whom late thou saw'st upon his shield expire, Son of our Ulmen, didst thou mark no trace, In these sad looks, of a remembered face? Dost thou remember Izdabel? Look here! It is thy father's hatchet and his spear. Friend of my infant days, how I rejoice, Lautaro cried, once more to hear that voice! Life like a dream, since last we met, has fled— Oh, my beloved sister, thou art dead! INDIAN. I come to guide thee through untrodden ways, To the lone valley, where thy father's days Were passed; where every cave and every tree, From morn to morn, reminded him of thee! Lautaro cried: Here, faithful Indian, stay; I have a last sad duty yet to pay. A little while we part:—thou here remain. He spake, and passed like lightning o'er the plain. Ah, cease, Castilian maid, thy vain alarms! See where he comes—his father in his arms! Now lead, he cried. The Indian, sad and still, Paced on from wood to vale, from vale to hill; Her infant tired, and hushed a while to rest, Smiled, in a dream, upon its mother's breast; The pensive mother gray Anselmo led; Behind, Lautaro bore his father dead. Beneath the branching palms they slept at night; The small birds waked them ere the morning light. Before their path, in distant view, appeared The mountain-smoke, that its dark column reared O'er Andes' summits, in the pale blue sky, Lifting their icy pinnacles so high. Four days they onward held their eastern way; On the fifth rising morn, before them lay Chillan's lone glen, amid whose windings green, The Warrior's loved and last abode was seen. No smoke went up, a stillness reigned around, Save where the waters fell with soothing sound, Save where the Thenca sang so loud and clear, And the bright humming-bird was spinning near. Yet here all human tumults seemed to cease, And sunshine rested on the spot of peace; The myrtles bloomed as fragrant and as green As if Lautaro scarce had left the scene; And in his ear the falling waters' spray Seemed swelling with the sounds of yesterday. Where yonder rock the aged cedars shade, There shall my father's bones in peace be laid. Beneath the cedar's shade they dug the ground; The small and sad communion gathered round. Beside the grave stood aged Izdabel, And broke the spear, and cried: Farewell, farewell! Lautaro hid his face, and sighed Adieu! As the stone hatchet in the grave he threw. The little child that to its mother clung, Stretched out its arm, then on her garment hung, With sidelong looks, half-shrinking, half-amazed, And dropped its flowers, unconscious, as it gazed. And now Anselmo, his pale brow inclined, The honoured relics, dust to dust, consigned With Christian rites, and sung, on bending knee, “Eternam pacem dona, Domine.” Then rising up he closed the holy book; And lifting in the beam his lighted look, (The cross, with meekness, folded on his breast), Here, too, he cried, my bones in peace shall rest! Few years remain to me, and never more Shall I behold, O Spain! thy distant shore! Here lay my bones, that the same tree may wave O'er the poor Christian's and the Indian's grave. Oh, may it (when the sons of future days Shall hear our tale and on the hillock gaze), Oh, may it teach, that charity should bind, Where'er they roam, the brothers of mankind! The time shall come, when wildest tribes shall hear Thy voice, O Christ! and drop the slaughtering spear. Yet we condemn not him who bravely stood, To seal his country's freedom with his blood; And if, in after-times, a ruthless band Of fell invaders sweep my native land, May she, by Chili's stern example led, Hurl back his thunder on the assailant's head; Sustained by Freedom, strike the avenging blow, And learn one virtue from her ancient foe!

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. BANWELL HILL; A LAY OF THE SEVERN SEA. PART FIRST. Introduction—Retrospect—General view—Cave—Bones—Brief sketch of events since the deposit—Egypt—Druid—Roman—Saxon—Dane—Norman —Hill—Campanula—Bleadon—Weston—Steep Holms—Solitary flower on Steep Holms, the Peony—Flat Holms—Three unknown graves—Sea—Sea treacherous in its tranquillity—Mr Elton's children—Packet-boat sunk. If, gazing from this eminence, I wake, With thronging thoughts, the harp of poesy Once more, ere night descend, haply with tones Fainter, and haply with a long farewell; If, looking back upon the lengthened way My feet have trod, since, long ago, I left Those well-known shores, and when mine eyes are filled With tears, I take the pencil in its turn, And shading light the landscape spread below, So smilingly beguile those starting tears; Something, the feelings of the human heart— Something, the scene itself, and something more— A wish to gratify one generous mind— May plead for pardon. To this spot I came To view the dark memorials of a world Perished at the Almighty's voice, and swept With all its noise away! Since then, unmarked, In that rude cave those dark memorials lay, And told no tale! Spirit of other times, Sad shadow of the ancient world, come forth! Thou who has slept four thousand years, awake! Rise from the cavern's last recess, and say, What giant cleft in twain the neighbouring rocks, Then slept for ages in vast Ogo's Cave, And left them rent and frowning from that hour; Say, rather, when the stern Archangel stood, Above the tossing of the flood, what arm Shattered this mountain, and its hollow chasm Heaped with the mute memorials of that doom! Spirit of other times, thou speakest not! Yet who could gaze a moment on that wreck Of desolation, but must pause to think Of the mutations of the globe—of time, Hurrying to onward spoil—of his own life, Swift passing, as the summer light, away— Of Him who spoke, and the dread storm went forth. The surge came, and the surge went back, and there— There—when the black abyss had ceased to roar, And waters, shrinking from the rocks and hills, Slept in the solitary sunshine—there The bones that strew the inmost cavern lay: And when forgotten centuries had passed, And the gray smoke went up from villages, And cities, with their towers and temples, shone, And kingdoms rose and perished—there they lay! The crow sailed o'er the spot; the villager Plodded to morning toil, yet undisturbed They lay:—when, lo! as if but yesterday The Archangel's trump had thundered o'er the deep, The mighty shade of ages that are passed Towers into light! Say, Christian, is it true, That dim recess, that cavern, heaped with bones, Will echo to thy Bible! But a while Here let me stand, and gaze upon the scene; That headland, and those winding sands, and mark The morning sunshine, on that very shore Where once a child I wandered. Oh! return, (I sigh) return a moment, days of youth, Of childhood,—oh, return! How vain the thought, Vain as unmanly! yet the pensive Muse, Unblamed, may dally with imaginings; For this wide view is like the scene of life, Once traversed o'er with carelessness and glee, And we look back upon the vale of years, And hear remembered voices, and behold, In blended colours, images and shades Long passed, now rising, as at Memory's call, Again in softer light. I see thee not, Home of my infancy—I see thee not, Thou fane that standest on the hill alone, The homeward sailor's sea-mark; but I view Brean Down beyond; and there thy winding sands, Weston; and, far away, one wandering ship, Where stretches into mist the Severn sea. There, mingled with the clouds, old Cambria draws Its stealing line of mountains, lost in haze; There, in mid-channel, sit the sister holms, Secure and tranquil, though the tide's vast sweep, As it rides by, might almost seem to rive The deep foundations of the earth again, Threatening, as once, resistless, to ascend In tempest to this height, to bury here Fresh-weltering carcases! But, lo, the Cave! Descend the steps, cut rudely in the rock, Cautious. The yawning vault is at our feet! Long caverns, winding within caverns, spread On either side their labyrinths; all dark, Save where the light falls glimmering on huge bones, In mingled multitudes. Ere yet we ask Whose bones, and of what animals they formed The structure, when no human voice was heard In all this isle; look upward to the roof That silent drips, and has for ages dripped, From which, like icicles, the stalactites Depend: then ask of the geologist, How nature, vaulting the rude chamber, scooped Its vast recesses; he with learning vast Will talk of limestone rock, of stalactites, And oolites, and hornblende, and graywacke— With sounds almost as craggy as the rock Of which he speaks—feldspar, and gneis, and schorl! But let us learn of this same troglodyte, Who guides us through the winding labyrinth, The erudite “Professor” of the cave, Not of the college; stagyrite of bones. He leads, with flickering candle, through the heaps Himself has piled, and placed in various forms, Grotesque arrangement, while the cave itself Seems but his element of breathing! Look! This humereus is that of the wild ox. The very candle, as with sympathy, Flares while he speaks, in glimmering wonderment! But who can mark these visible remains, Nor pause to think how awful, and how true, The dread event they speak! What monuments Hath man, since then, the lord, the emmet, raised On earth! He hath built pyramids, and said, Stand there! and in their solitude they stood, Whilst, like the camel's shadow on the sands Beneath them years and ages passed. He said, My name shall never die! and like the God Of silence, with his finger on his lip, Oblivion mocked, then pointed to a tomb, 'Mid vast and winding vaults, without a name. Where art thou, Thebes? The chambers of the dead Echo, Behold! and twice ten thousand men, Even in their march of rapine and of blood, Involuntary halted, at the sight Of thy majestic wreck, for many a league— Sphynxes, colossal fanes, and obelisks— Pale in the morning sun! Ambition sighed A moment, and passed on. In this rude isle, The Druid altars frowned; and still they stand, As silent as the barrows at their feet, Yet tell the same stern tale. Soldier of Rome, Art thou come hither to this land remote Hid in the ocean-waste? Thy chariot wheels Rung on that road below!—Cohorts, and turms, With their centurions, in long file appear, Their golden eagles glittering to the sun, O'er the last line of spears; and standard-flags Wave, and the trumpets sounding to advance, And shields, and helms, and crests, and chariots, mark The glorious march of Cæsar's soldiery, Firing the gray horizon! They are passed! And, like a gleam of glory, perishing, Leave but a name behind! So passes man, An armed spectre o'er a field of blood, And vanishes; and other armed shades Pass by, red battle hurtling as they pass. The Saxon kings have strewed their palaces From Thames to Tyne. But, lo! the sceptre shakes; The Dane, remorseless as the hurricane That sweeps his native cliffs, harries the land! What terror strode before his track of blood! What hamlets mourned his desultory march, When on the circling hills, along the sea, The beacon-flame shone nightly! He has passed! Now frowns the Norman victor on his throne, And every cottage shrouds its lonely fire, As the sad curfew sounds. Yet Piety, With new-inspiring energies, awoke, And ampler polity: in woody vales, In unfrequented wilds, and forest-glens, The towers of the sequestered abbey shone, As when the pinnacles of Glaston-Fane First met the morning light. The parish church, Then too, exulting o'er the ruder cross, Upsprung, till soon the distant village peal Flings out its music, where the tapering spire Adds a new picture to the sheltered vale. Uphill, thy rock, where sits the lonely church, Above the sands, seems like the chronicler Of other times, there left to tell the tale! But issuing from the cave, look round, behold How proudly the majestic Severn rides On to the sea; how gloriously in light It rides! Along this solitary ridge, Where smiles, but rare, the blue campanula, Among the thistles and gray stones that peep Through the thin herbage, to the highest point Of elevation, o'er the vale below, Slow let us climb. First look upon that flower, The lowly heath-bell, smiling at our feet. How beautiful it smiles alone! The Power That bade the great sea roar, that spread the heavens, That called the sun from darkness, decked that flower, And bade it grace this bleak and barren hill. Imagination, in her playful mood, Might liken it to a poor village maid, Lowly, but smiling in her lowliness, And dressed so neatly as if every day Were Sunday. And some melancholy bard Might, idly musing, thus discourse to it:— Daughter of Summer, who dost linger here, Decking the thistly turf, and arid hill, Unseen, let the majestic dahlia Glitter, an empress, in her blazonry Of beauty; let the stately lily shine, As snow-white as the breast of the proud swan Sailing upon the blue lake silently, That lifts her tall neck higher as she views Her shadow in the stream! Such ladies bright May reign unrivalled in their proud parterres! Thou wouldst not live with them; but if a voice, Fancy, in shaping mood, might give to thee, To the forsaken primrose thou wouldst say— Come, live with me, and we two will rejoice: Nor want I company; for when the sea Shines in the silent moonlight, elves and fays, Gentle and delicate as Ariel, That do their spiritings on these wild holts, Circle me in their dance, and sing such songs As human ear ne'er heard! But cease the strain, Lest wisdom and severer truth should chide. Behind that windmill, sailing round and round, Like days on days revolving, Bleadon lies, Where first I pondered on the grammar-lore, Sad as the spelling-book, beneath the roof Of its secluded parsonage; Brean Down Emerges o'er the edge of Hutton Hill, Just seen in paler light! And Weston there, Where I remember a few cottages Sprinkling the sand, uplifts its tower, and shines, As if in conscious beauty, o'er the scene. And I have seen a far more welcome sight, The living line of population stream— Children, and village maids, and gray old men— Stream o'er the sands to church: such change has been In the brief compass of one hastening life! And yet that hill, the light, is to my eyes Familiar as those sister isles that sit In the mid channel! Look, how calm they sit, As listening each to the tide's rocking roar! Of different aspects—this, abrupt and high, And desolate, and cold, and bleak, uplifts Its barren brow—barren, but on its steep One native flower is seen, the peony; One flower, which smiles in sunshine or in storm, There sits companionless, but yet not sad: She has no sister of the summer-field, None to rejoice with her when spring returns, None that, in sympathy, may bend its head, When evening winds blow hollow o'er the rock, In autumn's gloom! So Virtue, a fair flower, Blooms on the rock of Care, and, though unseen, So smiles in cold seclusion; while, remote From the world's flaunting fellowship, it wears, Like hermit Piety, one smile of peace, In sickness or in health, in joy or tears, In summer days or cold adversity; And still it feels Heaven's breath, reviving, steal On its lone breast; feels the warm blessedness Of Heaven's own light about it, though its leaves Are wet with evening tears! Yonder island Seems not so desolate, nor frowns aloof, As if from human kind. The lighthouse there, Through the long winter night, shows its pale fire; And three forgotten mounds mark the rude graves, None knows of whom; but those of men who breathed, And bore their part in life, and looked to Heaven, As man looks now!—they died and left no name! Fancy might think, amid the wilderness Of waves, they sought to hide from human eyes All memory of their fortunes. Till the trump Of doom, they rest unknown. But mark that hill— Where Kewstoke seems to creep into the sea, Thy abbey, Woodspring, rose. Wild is the spot; And there three mailed murderers retired, To the last point of land. There they retired, And there they knelt upon the ground, and cried, Bury us 'mid the waves, where none may know The whispered secret of a deed of blood! No stone is o'er those graves:—the sullen tide, As it flows by and sounds along the shore, Seems moaningly to say, Pray for our souls! Nor other “Miserere” have they had At eve, nor other orison at morn. Thou hast put on thy mildest look to-day, Thou mighty element! Solemn, and still, And motionless, and touched with softer light, And without noise, lies all thy long expanse. Thou seemest now as calm, as if a child Might dally with thy playfulness, and stand, The weak winds lifting gently its light hair, Upon thy margin, watching one by one The long waves, breaking slow, with such a sound As Silence, in her dreamy mood, might love, When she more softly breathed, fearing a breath Might mar thy placidness! Oh, treachery! So still, and like a giant in his strength Reposing, didst thou lie, when the fond sire One moment looked, and saw his blithsome boys Gay on the sands, one moment, and the next, Heart-stricken and bereft, by the same surge, Stood in his desolation;—for he looked, And thought how he had blessed them in their sleep, And the next moment they were borne away, Snatched by the circling surge, and seen no more; While morning shone, and not a ripple told How terrible and dark a deed was done! And so the seas were hushed, and not a cloud Marred the pale moonlight, save that, here and there, Wandering far off, some feathery shreds were seen, As the sole orb, above the lighthouse, held Its course in loveliness; and not a sound Came from the distant deep, save that, at times, Amid the noise of human merriment, The ear might seem to catch a low faint moan, A boding sound, as of a dying dirge, From the sunk rocks; while all was still beside, And every star seemed listening in its watch; When the gay packet-bark, to Erin bound, Resounding with the laugh and song, went on! Look! she is gone! O God! she is gone down, With her light-hearted company; gone down, And all at once is still, save, on the mast, Just peering o'er the waters, the wild shrieks Of three, at times, are heard! They, when the dead Were round them, floating on the moonlight wave, Kept there their dismal watch till morning dawned, And to the living world were then restored! PART SECOND. First sound of the sea—First sight of the sea—Mother—Children—Uphill parsonage—Father—Wells clock—Clock figure—Contrast of village manners —Village maid—Rural nymph before the justices—State of agricultural districts—Cause of crime—Workhouse girl—Manufactory ranters—Prosing parson—Prig parson—Calvinistic commentators, etc.—Anti-moral preaching —True and false piety—Crimes passed over by anti-moral preachers— Bible, without note or comment—English Juggernaut—Village picture of Coombe—Village-school children, educated by Mrs P. Scrope—Annual meeting on the lawn of 140 children—Old nurse—Benevolence of English landlords —Poor widow and daughter—Stourhead—Ken at Longleat—Marston house—Early travels in Switzerland—Compton house—Clergyman's wife— Village clergyman. A shower, even while we gaze, steals o'er the scene, Shrouding it, and the sea-view is shout out, Save where, beyond the holms, one thread of light Hangs, and a pale and sunny stream shoots on, O'er the dim vapours, faint and far away, Like Hope's still light beyond the storms of Time. Come, let us rest a while in this rude seat! I was a child when first I heard the sound Of the great sea. 'Twas night, and journeying far, We were belated on our road, 'mid scenes New and unknown,—a mother and her child, Now first in this wide world a wanderer:— My father came, the pastor of the church That crowns the high hill crest, above the sea; When, as the wheels went slow, and the still night Seemed listening, a low murmur met the ear, Not of the winds:—my mother softly said, Listen! it is the sea! With breathless awe, I heard the sound, and closer pressed her hand. Much of the sea, in infant wonderment, I oft had heard, and of the shipwrecked man, Who sees, on some lone isle, day after day, The sun sink o'er the solitude of waves, Like Crusoe; and the tears would start afresh, Whene'er my mother kissed my cheek, and told The story of that desolate wild man, And how the speaking bird, when he returned After long absence to his cave forlorn, Said, as in tones of human sympathy, Poor Robin Crusoe! Thoughts like these arose, When first I heard, at night, the distant sound, Great Ocean, “of thy everlasting voice!” Where the white parsonage, among the trees, Peeped out, that night I restless passed. The sea Filled all my thoughts; and when slow morning came, And the first sunbeam streaked the window-pane, I rose unnoticed, and with stealthy pace, Straggling along the village green, explored Alone my fearful but adventurous way; When, having turned the hedgerow, I beheld, For the first time, thy glorious element, Old Ocean, glittering in the beams of morn, Stretching far off, and, westward, without bound, Amid thy sole dominion, rocking loud! Shivering I stood, and tearful; and even now, When gathering years have marked my look,—even now I feel the deep impression of that hour, As but of yesterday! Spirit of Time, A moment pause, and I will speak to thee! Dark clouds are round thee; but, lo! Memory waves Her wand,—the clouds disperse, as the gray rack Disperses while we gaze, and light steals out, While the gaunt phantom almost seems to drop His scythe! Now shadows of the past, distinct, Are thronging round; the voices of the dead Are heard; and, lo! the very smoke goes up— For so it seems—from yonder tenement, Where leads the slender pathway to the door. Enter that small blue parlour: there sits one, A female, and a child is in her arms; A child leans at her side, intent to show A pictured book, and looks upon her face; One, from the green, comes with a cowslip ball; And one, a hero, sits sublime and horsed, Upon a rocking-steed, from Banwell-fair; This, drives his tiny wheel-barrow, without, On the green garden-sward; whilst one, apart, Sighs o'er his solemn task—the spelling-book— Half moody, half in tears. Some lines of thought Are on that matron's brow; yet placidness, Such as resigned religion gives, is there, Mingled with sadness; for who e'er beheld, Without one stealing sigh, a progeny Of infants clustering round maternal knees, Nor felt some boding fears, how they might fare In the wide world, when they who loved them most Were silent in their graves! Nay! pass not on, Till thou hast marked a book—the leaf turned down— Night Thoughts on Death and Immortality! This book, my mother! in the weary hours Of life, in every care, in every joy, Was thy companion: next to God's own Word, The book that bears this name, thou didst revere, Leaving a stain of tears upon the page, Whose lessons, with a more emphatic truth, Touched thine own heart! That heart has long been still! But who is he, of aspect more severe, Yet with a manly kindness in his mien, He, who o'erlooks yon sturdy labourer Delving the glebe! My father as he lived! That father, and that mother, “earth to earth, And dust to dust,” the inevitable doom Hath long consigned! And where is he, the son, Whose future fate they pondered with a sigh? Long, nor unprosperous, has been his way Through life's tumultuous scenes, who, when a child, Played in that garden platform in the sun; Or loitered o'er the common, and pursued The colts among the sand-hills; or, intent On hardier enterprise, his pumpkin-ship, New-rigged, and buoyant, with its tiny sail, Launched on the garden pond; or stretched his hand, At once forgetting all this glorious toil, When the bright butterfly came wandering by. But never will that day pass from his mind, When, scarcely breathing for delight, at Wells, He saw the horsemen of the clock ride round, As if for life; and ancient Blandifer, Seated aloft, like Hermes, in his chair Complacent as when first he took his seat, Some hundred years ago; saw him lift up, As if old Time was cowering at his feet, Solemn lift up his mace, and strike the bell, Himself for ever silent in his seat. How little thought I then, the hour would come, When the loved prelate of that beauteous fane, At whose command I write, might placidly Smile on this picture, in my future verse, When Blandifer had struck so many hours For me, his poet, in this vale of years, Himself unchanged and solemn as of yore! My father was the pastor, and the friend Of all who, living then—the scene is closed— Now silent in that rocky churchyard sleep, The aged and the young! A village then Was not as villages are now. The hind, Who delved, or “jocund drove his team a-field,” Had then an independence in his look And heart; and, plodding on his lowly path, Disdained a parish dole, content, though poor. He was the village monitor: he taught His children to be good, and read their book, And in the gallery took his Sunday place,— To-morrow, with the bee, to work. So passed His days of cheerful, independent toil; And when the pastor came that way, at eve, He had a ready present for the child Who read his book the best; and that poor child Remembered it, when, treading the same path In which his father trod, he so grew up Contented, till old Time had blanched his locks, And he was borne—whilst the bell tolled—to sleep In the same churchyard where his father slept! His daughter walked content, and innocent As lovely, in her lowly path. She turned The hour-glass, while the humming wheel went round, Or went “a-Maying” o'er the fields in spring, Leading her little brother by the hand, Along the village lane, and o'er the stile, To gather cowslips; and then home again, To turn her wheel, contented, through the day. Or, singing low, bend where her brother slept, Rocking the cradle, to “sweet William's grave!” No lure could tempt her from the woodbine shed, Where she grew up, and folded first her hands In infant prayer: yet oft a tear would steal Down her young cheek, to think how desolate That home would be when her poor mother died; Still praying that she ne'er might cause a pain, Undutiful, to “bring down her gray hairs With sorrow to the grave!” Now mark this scene! The fuming factory's polluted air Has stained the country! See that rural nymph, An infant in her arms! She claims the dole From the cold parish, which her faithless swain Denies: he stands aloof, with clownish leer; The constable behind—and mark his brow— Beckons the nimble clerk; the justice, grave, Turns from his book a moment, with a look Of pity, signs the warrant for her pay, A weekly eighteen pence; she, unabashed, Slides from the room, and not a transient blush, Far less the accusing tear, is on her cheek! A different scene comes next: That village maid Approaches timidly, yet beautiful; A tear is on her lids, when she looks down Upon her sleeping child. Her heart was won, The wedding-day was fixed, the ring was bought! 'Tis the same story—Colin was untrue! He ruined, and then left her to her fate. Pity her, she has not a friend on earth, And that still tear speaks to all human hearts But his, whose cruelty and treachery Caused it to flow! So crime still follows crime. Ask we the cause? See, where those engines heave, That spread their giant arms o'er all the land! The wheel is silent in the vale! Old age And youth are levelled by one parish law! Ask why that maid, all day, toils in the field, Associate with the rude and ribald clown, Even in the shrinking April of her youth? To earn her loaf, and eat it by herself. Parental love is smitten to the dust; Over a little smoke the aged sire Holds his pale hands—and the deserted hearth Is cheerless as his heart: but Piety Points to the Bible! Shut the book again: The ranter is the roving gospel now, And each his own apostle! Shut the book: A locust-swarm of tracts darken its light, And choke its utterance; while a Babel-rout Of mock-religionists, turn where we will, Have drowned the small still voice, till Piety, Sick of the din, retires to pray alone. But though abused Religion, and the dole Of pauper-pay, and vomitories huge Of smoke, are each a steam-engine of crime, Polluting, far and wide, the wholesome air, And withering life's green verdure underneath, Full many a poor and lowly flower of want Has Education nursed, like a pure rill, Winding through desert glens, and bade it live To grace the cottage with its mantling sweets. There was a village girl, I knew her well, From five years old and upwards; all her friends Were dead, and she was to the workhouse left, And there a witness to such sounds profane As might turn virtue pale! When Sunday came, Assembled with the children of the poor, Upon the lawn of my own parsonage, She stood among them: they were taught to read In companies and groups, upon the green, Each with its little book; her lighted eyes Shone beautiful where'er they turned; her form Was graceful; but her book her sole delight! Instructed thus she went a serving-maid Into the neighbouring town,—ah! who shall guide A friendless maid, so beautiful and young, From life's contagions! But she had been taught The duties of her humble lot, to pray To God, and that one heavenly Father's eye Was over rich and poor! On Sunday night, She read her Bible, turning still away From those who flocked, inflaming and inflamed, To nightly meetings; but she never closed Her eyes, or raised them to the light of morn, Without a prayer to Him who “bade the sun Go forth,” a giant, from his eastern gate! No art, no bribe, could lure her steps astray From the plain path, and lessons she had learned, A village child. She is a mother now, And lives to prove the blessings and the fruits Of moral duty, on the poorest child, When duty, and when sober piety, Impressing the young heart, go hand in hand. No villager was then a disputant In Calvinistic and contentious creeds; No pale mechanic, from a neighbouring sink Of steam and rank debauchery and smoke, Crawled forth upon a Sunday morn, with looks Saddening the very sunshine, to instruct The parish poor in evangelic lore; To teach them to cast off, “as filthy rags,” Good works! and listen to such ministers, Who all (be sure) “are worthy of their hire;” Who only preach for good of their poor souls, That they may turn “from darkness unto light,” And, above all, fly, as the gates of hell, Morality! and Baal's steeple house, Where, without “heart-work,” Doctor Littlegrace Drones his dull requiem to the snoring clerk!” True; he who drawls his heartless homily For one day's work, and plods, on wading stilts, Through prosing paragraphs, with inference, Methodically dull, as orthodox, Enforcing sagely that we all must die When God shall call—oh, what a pulpit drone Is he! The blue fly might as well preach “Hum,” And “so conclude!” But save me from the sight Of curate fop, half jockey and half clerk, The tandem-driving Tommy of a town, Disdaining books, omniscient of a horse, Impatient till September comes again, Eloquent only of “the pretty girl With whom he danced last night!” Oh! such a thing Is worse than the dull doctor, who performs Duly his stinted task, and then to sleep, Till Sunday asks another homily Against all innovations of the age, Mad missionary zeal, and Bible clubs, And Calvinists and Evangelicals! Yes! Evangelicals! Oh, glorious word! But who deserves that awful name? Not he Who spits his puny Puritanic spite On harmless recreation; who reviles All who, majestic in their distant scorn, Bear on in silence their calm Christian course. He only is the Evangelical Who holds in equal scorn dogmas and dreams, The Shibboleth of saintly magazines, Decked with most grim and godly visages; The cobweb sophistry, or the dark code Of commentators, who, with loathsome track, Crawl o'er a text, or on the lucid page, Beaming with heavenly love and God's own light, Sit like a nightmare! Soon a deadly mist Creeps o'er our eyes and heart, till angel forms Turn into hideous phantoms, mocking us, Even when we look for comfort at the spring And well of life, while dismal voices cry, Death! Reprobation! Woe! Eternal woe! He only is the Evangelical Who from the human commentary turns With tranquil scorn, and nearer to his heart Presses the Bible, till repentant tears, In silence, wet his cheek, and new-born faith, And hope, and charity, with radiant smile, Visit his heart,—all pointing to the cross! He only is the Evangelical, Who, with eyes fixed upon that spectacle, Christ and him crucified, with ardent hope, And holier feelings, lifts his thoughts from earth, And cries, My Father! Meantime, his whole heart Is on God's Word: he preaches Faith, and Hope, And Charity,—these three, and not that one! And Charity, the greatest of these three! Give me an Evangelical like this! But now The blackest crimes in tract-religion's code Are moral virtues! Spare the prodigal,— He may awake when God shall “call;” but, hell, Roll thy avenging flames, to swallow up The son who never left his father's home Lest he should trust to morals when he dies! Let him not lay the unction to his soul, That his upbraiding conscience tells no tale At that dread hour; bid him confess his sin, The greater that, with humble hope, he looks Back on a well-spent life! Bid him confess That he hath broken all God's holy laws,— In vain hath he done justly,—loved, in vain, Mercy, and hath walked humbly with his God! These are mere works; but faith is everything, And all in all! The Christian code contains No “if” or “but!” Let tabernacles ring, And churches too, with sanctimonious strains Baneful as these; and let such strains be heard Through half the land; and can we shut our eyes, And, sadly wondering, ask the cause of crimes, When infidelity stands lowering here, With open scorn, and such a code as this, So baneful, withers half the charities Of human hearts! Oh! dear is Mercy's voice To man, a mourner in the vale of sin And death: how dear the still small voice of Faith, That bids him raise his look beyond the clouds That hang o'er this dim earth; but he who tears Faith from her heavenly sisterhood, denies The gospel, and turns traitor to the cause He has engaged to plead. Come, Faith, and Hope, And Charity! how dear to the sad heart, The consolations and the glorious views That animate the Christian in his course! But save, oh! save me from the tract-led Miss, Who trots to every Bethel club, and broods O'er some black missionary's monstrous tale, Reckless of want around her! But the priest, Who deems the Almighty frowns upon his throne, Because two pair of harmless dowagers, Whose life has passed without a stain, beguile An evening hour with cards; who deems that hell Burns fiercer for a saraband; that thou— Thou, my sweet Shakspeare—thou, whose touch awakes The inmost heart of virtuous sympathy,— Thou, O divinest poet! at whose voice Sad Pity weeps, or guilty Terror drops The blood-stained dagger from his palsied hand,— That thou art pander to the criminal! He who thus edifies his Christian flock, Moves, more than even the Bethel-trotting Miss, My pity, my aversion, and my scorn. Cry aloud!—Oh, speak in thunder to the soul That sleeps in sin! Harrow the inmost heart Of murderous intent, till dew-drops stand Upon his haggard brow! Call conscience up, Like a stern spectre, whose dim finger points To dark misdeeds of yore! Wither the arm Of the oppressor, at whose feet the slave Crouches, and pleading lifts his fettered hands! Thou violator of the innocent Hide thee! Hence! hide thee in the deepest cave, From man's indignant sight! Thou hypocrite! Trample in dust thy mask, nor cry faith, faith, Making it but a hollow tinkling sound, That stirs not the foul heart! Horrible wretch! Look not upon the face of that sweet child, With thoughts which hell would tremble to conceive! Oh, shallow, and oh, senseless! In a world Where rank offences turn the good man pale, Who leave the Christian's sternest code, to vent Their petty ire on petty trespasses, If trespasses they are;—when the wide world Groans with the burthen of offence; when crimes Stalk on, with front defying, o'er the land, Whilst, her own cause betraying, Christian zeal Thus swallows camels, straining at a gnat! Therefore, without a comment, or a note, We love the Bible; and we prize the more The spirit of its pure unspotted page, As pure from the infectious breath that stains, Like a foul fume, its hallowed light, we hail The radiant car of heaven, amidst the clouds Of mortal darkness, and of human mist, Sole, as the sun in heaven! Oh! whilst the car Of God's own glory rolls along in light, We join the loud song of the Christian host, (All puny systems shrinking from the blaze), Hosannah to the car of light! Roll on! Saldanna's rocks have echoed to the hymns Of Faith, and Hope, and Charity! Roll on! Till the wild wastes of inmost Africa, Where the long Niger's track is lost, respond, Hosannah to the car of light! Roll on! From realm to realm, from shore to farthest shore, O'er dark pagodas, and huge idol-fanes, That frown along the Ganges' utmost stream, Till the poor widow, from the burning pile Starting, shall lift her hands to heaven, and weep That she has found a Saviour, and has heard The sounds of Christian love! Oh, horrible! The pile is smoking!—the bamboos lie there, That held her down when the last struggle shook The blazing pile! Hasten, O car of light! Alas for suffering nature! Juggernaut, Armed, in his giant car goes also forth, Goes forth amid his red and reeling priests, While thousands gasp and die beneath the wheels, As they go groaning on, 'mid cries, and drums, And flashing cymbals, and delirious songs Of tinkling dancing girls, and all the rout Of frantic superstition! Turn away! And is not Juggernaut himself with us? Not only cold insidious sophistry Comes, blinking with its taper-fume, to light, If so he may, the sun in the mid heaven! Not only blind and hideous blasphemy Scowls in his cloak, and mocks the glorious orb, Ascending, in its silence, o'er a world Of sin and sorrow; but a hellish brood Of imps, and fiends, and phantoms, ape the form Of godliness, till godliness itself Seems but a painted monster, and a name For darker crimes, at which the shuddering heart Shrinks; while the ranting rout, as they march on, Mock Heaven with hymns, till, see! pale Belial Sighs o'er a filthy tract, and Moloch marks, With gouts of blood, his brandished magazine! Start, monster, from the dismal dream! Look up! Oh! listen to the apostolic voice, That, like a voice from heaven, proclaims, To faith Add virtue! There is no mistaking here; Whilst moral education by the hand Shall lead the children to the house of God, Nor sever Christian faith from Christian love. If we would see the fruits of charity, Look at that village group, and paint the scene! Surrounded by a clear and silent stream, Where the swift trout shoots from the sudden ray, A rural mansion on the level lawn Uplifts its ancient gables, whose slant shade Is drawn, as with a line, from roof to porch, Whilst all the rest is sunshine. O'er the trees In front, the village church, with pinnacles And light gray tower, appears; whilst to the right, An amphitheatre of oaks extends Its sweep, till, more abrupt, a wooded knoll, Where once a castle frowned, closes the scene. And see! an infant troop, with flags and drum, Are marching o'er that bridge, beneath the woods, On to the table spread upon the lawn, Raising their little hands when grace is said; Whilst she who taught them to lift up their hearts In prayer, and to “remember, in their youth,” God, “their Creator,” mistress of the scene (Whom I remember once as young), looks on, Blessing them in the silence of her heart. And we too bless them. Oh! away, away! Cant, heartless cant, and that economy, Cold, and miscalled “political,” away! Let the bells ring—a Puritan turns pale To hear the festive sound: let the bells ring— A Christain loves them; and this holiday Remembers him, while sighs unbidden steal, Of life's departing and departed days, When he himself was young, and heard the bells, In unison with feelings of his heart— His first pure Christain feelings, hallowing The harmonious sound! And, children, now rejoice,— Now, for the holidays of life are few; Nor let the rustic minstrel tune, in vain, The cracked church-viol, resonant to-day Of mirth, though humble! Let the fiddle scrape Its merriment, and let the joyous group Dance in a round, for soon the ills of life Will come! Enough, if one day in the year, If one brief day, of this brief life, be given To mirth as innocent as yours! But, lo! That ancient woman, leaning on her staff! Pale, on her crutch she rests one withered hand; One withered hand, which Gerard Dow might paint, Even its blue veins! And who is she? The nurse Of the fair mistress of the scene: she led Her tottering steps in infancy—she spelt Her earliest lesson to her; and she now Leans from that open window, while she thinks— When summer comes again, the turf will lie On my cold breast; but I rejoice to see My child thus leading on the progeny Of her poor neighbours in the peaceful path Of humble virtue! I shall be at rest, Perhaps, when next they meet; but my last prayer Is with them, and the mistress of this home. “The innocent are gay,” gay as the lark That sings in morn's first sunshine; and why not? But may they ne'er forget, as life steals on, In age, the lessons they have learned in youth! How false the charge, how foul the calumny On England's generous aristocracy, That, wrapped in sordid, selfish apathy, They feel not for the poor! Ask, is it true? Lord of the whirling wheels, the charge is false! Ten thousand charities adorn the land, Beyond thy cold conception, from this source. What cottage child but has been neatly clad, And taught its earliest lesson, from their care? Witness that schoolhouse, mantled with festoon Of various plants, which fancifully wreath Its window-mullions, and that rustic porch, Whence the low hum of infant voices blend With airs of spring, without. Now, all alive, The green sward rings with play, among the shrubs— Hushed the long murmur of the morning task, Before the pensive matron's desk! But turn, And mark that aged widow! By her side Is God's own Word; and, lo! the spectacles Are yet upon the page. Her daughter kneels And prays beside her! Many years have shed Their snow so silently and softly down Upon her head, that Time, as if to gaze, Seems for a moment to suspend his flight Onward, in reverence to those few gray hairs, That steal beneath her cap, white as its snow. Whilst the expiring lamp is kept alive, Thus feebly, by a duteous daughter's love, Her last faint prayer, ere all is dark on earth, Will to the God of heaven ascend, for those Whose comforts smoothed her silent bed. And thou, Witness Elysian Tempe of Stourhead! Oh, not because, with bland and gentle smile, Adding a radiance to the look of age, Like eve's still light, thy liberal master spreads His lettered treasures;—not because his search Has dived the Druid mound, illustrating His country's annals, and the monuments Of darkest ages;—not because his woods Wave o'er the dripping cavern of Old Stour, Where classic temples gleam along the edge Of the clear waters, winding beautiful;— Oh! not because the works of breathing art, Of Poussin, Rubens, Rembrandt, Gainsborough, Start, like creations, from the silent walls; To thee, this tribute of respect and love, Beloved, benevolent, and generous Hoare, Grateful I pay;—but that, when thou art dead (Late may it be!) the poor man's tear will fall, And his voice falter, when he speaks of thee. And witness thou, magnificent abode, Where virtuous Ken, with his gray hairs and shroud, Came, for a shelter from the world's rude storm, In his old age, leaving his palace-throne, Having no spot where he might lay his head, In all the earth! Oh, witness thou, the seat Of his first friend, his friend from schoolboy days! Oh! witness thou, if one who wanted bread Has not found shelter there; if one poor man Has been deserted in his hour of need; Or one poor child been left without a guide, A father, an instructor, and a friend; In him, the pastor, and distributor Of bounties large, yet falling silently As dews on the cold turf! And witness thou, Marston, the seat of my kind, honoured friend— My kind and honoured friend, from youthful days. Then wandering on the banks of Rhine, we saw Cities and spires, beneath the mountains blue, Gleaming; or vineyards creep from rock to rock; Or unknown castles hang, as if in clouds: Or heard the roaring of the cataract, Far off, beneath the dark defile or gloom Of ancient forests; till behold, in light, Foaming and flashing, with enormous sweep, Through the rent rocks—where, o'er the mist of spray The rainbow, like a fairy in her bower, Is sleeping, while it roars—that volume vast, White, and with thunder's deafening roar, comes down. Live long, live happy, till thy journey close, Calm as the light of day! Yet witness thou, The seat of noble ancestry, the seat Of science, honoured by the name of Boyle, Though many sorrows, since we met in youth, Have pressed thy generous master's manly heart, Witness, the partner of his joys and griefs; Witness the grateful tenantry, the home Of the poor man, the children of that school— Still warm benevolence sits smiling there. And witness, the fair mansion, on the edge Of those chalk hills, which, from my garden walk, Daily I see, whose gentle mistress droops With her own griefs, yet never turns her look From others' sorrows; on whose lids the tear Shines yet more lovely than the light of youth. And many a cottage-garden smiles, whose flowers Invite the music of the morning bee. And many a fireside has shot out, at eve, Its light upon the old man's withered hand And pallid cheek from their benevolence— Sad as is still the parish-pauper's home— Who shed around their patrimonial seats The light of heaven-descending Charity. And every feeling of the Christian heart Would rise accusing, could I pass unsung, Thee, fair as Charity's own form, who late Didst stand beneath the porch of that gray fane, Soliciting a mite from all who passed, With such a smile, as to refuse would seem To do a wrong to Charity herself. How many blessings, silent and unheard, The mistress of the lonely parsonage Dispenses, when she takes her daily round Among the aged and the sick, whose prayers And blessings are her only recompense! How many pastors, by cold obloquy And senseless hate reviled, tread the same path Of charity in silence, taught by Him Who was reviled not to revile again; And leaving to a righteous God their cause! Come, let us, with the pencil in our hand, Portray a character. What book is this? Rector of Overton! I know him not; But well I know the Vicar, and a man More worthy of that name, and worthier still To grace a higher station of our Church, None knows;—a friend and father to the poor, A scholar, unobtrusive, yet profound, “As e'er my conversation coped withal;” His piety unvarnished, but sincere. Killarney's lake, and Scotia's hills, have heard His summer-wandering reed; nor on the themes Of hallowed inspiration has his harp Been silent, though ten thousand jangling strings— When all are poets in this land of song, And every field chinks with its grasshopper— Have well-nigh drowned the tones; but poesy Mingles, at eventide, with many a mood Of stirring fancy, on his silent heart When o'er those bleak and barren downs, in rain Or sunshine, where the giant Wansdeck sweeps, Homewards he bends his solitary way. Live long; and late may the old villager Look on thy stone, amid the churchyard grass, Remembering years of kindness, and the tongue, Eloquent of his Maker, when he sat At church, and heard the undivided code Of apostolic truth—of hope, of faith, Of charity—the end and test of all. Live long; and though I proudly might recall The names of many friends—like thee, sincere And pious, and in solitude adorned With rare accomplishments—this grateful praise Accept, congenial to the poet's theme; For well I know, haply when I am dead, And in my shroud, whene'er thy homeward path Lies o'er those hills, and thou shalt cast a look Back on our garden-slope, and Bremhill tower, Thou wilt remember me, and many a day There passed in converse and sweet harmony. A truce to satire, and to harsh reproof, Severer arguments, that have detained The unwilling Muse too long:—come, while the clouds Work heavy and the winds at intervals, Pipe, and at intervals sink in a sigh, As breathed o'er sounds and shadows of the past— Change we our style and measure, to relate A village tale of a poor Cornish maid, And of her prayer-book. It is sad, but true; And simply told, though not in lady phrase Of modish song, may touch some gentle heart, And wake an interest, when description fails. PART THIRD. A tale of a Cornish maid—Her prayer-book—Her mother—Widow and son —Tales of sea life—Phantom-ship of the Cape. Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book! So William cried, with wild and frantic look. She whom he loved was in her shroud, nor pain Nor grief can visit her sad heart again. There is no sculptured tombstone at her head; No rude memorial marks her lowly bed: The village children, every holiday, Round the green turf, in summer sunshine play; And none, but those now bending to the tomb, Remember Mary, lovely in her bloom! Yet oft the hoary swain, when autumn sighs Through the long grass, sees a dim form arise, That hies in glimmering moonlight to the brook, Its wan lips moving, in its hand a book. So, like a bruised flower, and in the pride Of youth and beauty, injured Mary died. William some years survived, but years no trace Of his sick heart's deep anguish could erase. Still the dread spectre seemed to rise, and, worse, Still in his ears rang the appalling curse! While loud he cries, despair upon his look, Oh! shut the book, my Mary, shut the book! The sun is slowly westering now, and lo, How beautiful steals out the humid bow, A radiant arch! Listen, whilst I relate William's dread judgment, and poor Mary's fate. I think I see the pine, that, heavily Swaying, yet seems as for the dead to sigh. How many generations, since the day Of its green pride, have passed, like leaves, away! How many children of the hamlet played Round its hoar trunk, who at its feet were laid, Withered and gray old men! In life's first bloom How many has it seen borne to the tomb! But never one so sunk in hopeless woe As she who lies in the cold grave below. Her Sabbath-book, from which at church she prayed, Was her poor father's, in that churchyard laid: For Mary grew as beautiful in youth, As taught at church the lore of heavenly truth. What different passions in her bosom strove, When first she heard the tale of village love! The youth whose voice then won her partial ear, A yeoman's son, had passed his twentieth year; She scarce eighteen: her mother, with the care Of boding age, oft whispered, Oh, beware! For William was a thoughtless youth, and wild, And like a colt unbroken, from a child: At length, if not to serious thoughts awake, He came to church, at least for Mary's sake. Young Mary, while her father was alive, Saw all things round the humble dwelling thrive; Her widowed mother now was growing old, And bit by bit their worldly goods were sold: Mary remained, her mother's hope and pride! How oft when she was sleeping by her side, That mother waked, and kissed her cheek, with tears Praying for blessings on her future years,— When she, her mother, earthly trials o'er, Should rest in the cold grave, to grieve no more! But Mary to love's dream her heart resigned, And gave to fancy all her youthful mind. Shall I describe her! Didst thou never mark A soft blue light, beneath eye-lashes dark? Such was her eye's soft light;—her chestnut hair, Light as she tripped, waved lighter to the air; And, with her prayer-book, when on Sunday dressed, Her looks a sweet but lowly grace expressed, As modest as the violet at her breast. Sometimes all day by her lone mother's side She sat, and oft would turn, a tear to hide. Where winds the brook, by yonder bordering wood, Her mother's solitary cottage stood: A few white pales in front, fenced from the road The garden-plot, and poor but neat abode. Before the window, 'mid the flowers of spring A bee-hive hummed, whose bees were murmuring; Beneath an ivied bank, abrupt and high, A small clear well reflected bank and sky, In whose translucent mirror, smooth and still, From time to time, a small bird dipped its bill. Here the first bluebell, and, of livelier hue, The daffodil and polyanthus grew. 'Twas Mary's care a jessamine to train, With small white blossoms, round the window-pane: A rustic wicket opened to the meads, Where a scant pathway to the hamlet leads: And near, a water-wheel toiled round and round, Dashing the o'ershot stream, with long continuous sound. Beyond, when the brief shower had sailed away, The tapering spire shone out in sunlight gray; And o'er that mountain's northern point, to sight Stretching far on, the main-sea rolled in light. Enter: within, see everything how neat! One book lies open on the window-seat, The spectacles are on a leaf of Job: There, mark, a map of the terrestrial globe; And opposite, with its prolific stem, The Christian's tree, and New Jerusalem; Here, see a printed paper, to record A veritable letter from our Lord: Two books are on the window-ledge beneath,— The Book of Prayer, and Drelincourt on Death: Some cowslips, in a cup of china placed, A painted shelf above the chimney graced: Grown like its mistress old, with half-shut eyes, Save when, at times, awaked by wandering flies, Tib in the sunshine of the casement lies. 'Twas spring time now, with birds the garden rung, And Mary's linnet at the window sung. Whilst in the air the vernal music floats, The cuckoo only joins his two sweet notes: But those—oh! listen, for he sings more near— So musical, so mellow, and so clear! Not sweeter, where thy mighty waters sweep, Missouri, through the night of forests deep, Resounds, from glade to glade, from rock to hill, While fervent harmonies the wild wood fill, The solitary note of “whip-poor-will;” Mary's old mother stops her wheel to say, The cuckoo! hark! how sweet he sings to-day! It is not long, not long to Whitsuntide, And Mary then shall be a happy bride. On Sunday morn, when a slant light was flung Upon the tower, and the first peal was rung, William and Mary smiling would repair, Arm linked in arm, to the same house of prayer. The bells will sound more merrily, he cried, And gently pressed her hand, at Whitsuntide: She checked the rising thoughts, and hung her head; And Mary, ere one year had passed—was dead! 'Twas said, and many would the tale believe, Her shrouded form was seen upon that eve, When, gliding through the churchyard, they appear— They who shall die within the coming year. All pale, and strangely piteous, was her look, Her right hand was stretched out, and held a book; O'er it her wet hair dripped, while the moon cast A cold wan light, as in her shroud she passed! I cannot say if this were so, but late, She went to Madern-stone, to learn her fate, What there she heard ne'er came to human ears— But from that hour she oft was seen in tears. Mild zephyr breathes, the butterfly more bright Strays, wavering, o'er the pales, in rainbow light; The lamb, the colt, the blackbird in the brake, Seem all the vernal feeling to partake; The lark sings high in air, itself unseen, The hasty swallow skims the village-green; And all things seem, to the full heart, to bring The blissful breathings of the world's first spring. How lovely is the sunshine of May-morn! The garden bee has wound his earliest horn, Busied from flower to flower, as he would say, Up! Mary! up this merry morn of May! Now lads and lasses of the hamlet bore Branches of blossomed thorn or sycamore; And at her mother's porch a garland hung, While thus their rural roundelay they sung:— And we were up as soon as day, To fetch the summer home, The summer and the radiant May, For summer now is come. In Madern vale the bell-flowers bloom, And wave to Zephyr's breath: The cuckoo sings in Morval Coombe, Where nods the purple heath. Come, dance around Glen-Aston tree— We bring a garland gay, And Mary of Guynear shall be Our Lady of the May. But where is William? Did he not declare, He would be first the blossomed bough to bear! She will not join the train! and see! the flower She gathered now is fading! Hour by hour She watched the sunshine on the thatch; again Her mother turns the hour-glass; now, the pane The westering sun has left—the long May-day So Mary wore in hopes and fears away. Slow twilight steals. By the small garden gate She stands: Oh! William never came so late! Her mother's voice is heard: Good child, come in; Dream not of bliss on earth—it is a sin: Come, take the Bible down, my child, and read; In sickness, and in sorrow, and in need, By friends forsaken, and by fears oppressed, There only can the weary heart find rest. Her thin hands, marked by many a wandering vein, Her mother turned the silent glass again; The rushlight now is lit, the Bible read, Yet, ere sad Mary can retire to bed, She listens!—Hark! no voice, no step she hears,— Oh! seek thy bed to hide those bursting tears! When the slow morning came, the tale was told, (Need it have been?) that William's love was cold. But hope yet whispers, dry the accusing tear,— When Sunday comes, he will again be here! And Sunday came, and struggling from a cloud. The sun shone bright—the bells were chiming loud— And lads and lasses, in their best attire, Were tripping past—the youth, the child, the sire; But William came not. With a boding heart Poor Mary saw the Sunday crowd depart: And when her mother came, with kerchief clean, The last who tottered homeward o'er the green, Mary, to hear no more of peace on earth, Retired in silence to the lonely hearth. Next day the tidings to the cottage came, That William's heart confessed another flame: That, with the bailiff's daughter he was seen, At the new tabernacle on the green; That cold and wayward falsehood made him prove Alike a traitor to his faith and love. The bells are ringing, it is Whitsuntide,— And there goes faithless William with his bride. Turn from the sight, poor Mary! Day by day, The dread remembrance wore her heart away: Untimely sorrow sat upon her cheek, And her too trusting heart was left to break. Six melancholy months have slowly passed, And dark is heard November's hollow blast. Sometimes, with tearful moodiness she smiled, Then, still and placid looked, as when a child, Or raised her eyes disconsolate and wild. Oft, as she strayed the brook's green marge along, She there would sing one sad and broken song:— Lay me where the willows wave, In the cold moonlight; Shine upon my lowly grave, Sadly, stars of night! I to you would fly for rest, But a stone, a stone, Lies like lead upon my breast, And every hope is flown. Lay me where the willows wave, In the cold moonlight; Shine upon my lowly grave, Sadly, stars of night! Her mother said, Thou shalt not be confined, Poor maid, for thou art harmless, and thy mind The air may soothe, as fitfully it blows, Whispering forgetfulness, if not repose. So Mary wandered to the northern shore; There oft she heard the gaunt Tregagel roar Among the rocks; and when the tempest blew, And, like the shivered foam, her long hair flew, And all the billowy space was tossing wide, Rock on! thou melancholy main, she cried, I love thy voice, oh, ever-sounding sea, Nor heed this sad world while I look on thee! Then on the surge she gazed, with vacant stare, Or tripping with wild fennel in her hair, Sang merrily: Oh! we must dry the tear, For Mab, the queen of fairies, will be here,— William, she shall know all!—and then again Her ditty died into its first sad strain:— Lay me where the willows wave, In the cold moonlight; Shine upon my lowly grave, Sadly, stars of night! When home returned, the tears ran down apace; She looked in silence in her mother's face; Then, starting up, with wilder aspect cried, How happy shall we be at Whitsuntide, Then, mother, I shall be a bride—a bride! Ah! some dire thought seems in her breast to rise, Stern with terrific joy she rolls her eyes: Her mother heeded not; nor when she took, With more impatient haste, her Sunday book, She heeded not—for age had dimmed her sight. Her mother now is left alone: 'tis night. Mary! poor Mary! her sad mother cried, Mary! my Mary!—but no voice replied. Next morn, light-hearted William passed along, And careless hummed a desultory song, Bound to St Ives' revel. Not a ray Yet streaked the pale dawn of the dubious day; The sun is yet below the hills: but, look! There is the tower—the mill—the stile—the brook,— And there is Mary's cottage! All is still! Listen! no sound is heard but of the mill. 'Tis true, the toils of day are not begun, But Mary always rose before the sun. Still at the door, a leafless relic now, Appeared a remnant of the May-day bough; No hour-glass, in the window, tells the hours: Where is poor Mary, where her book, her flowers? Ah! was it fancy?—as he passed along, He thought he heard a spirit's feeble song. Struck by the thrilling sound, he turned his look. Upon the ground there lay an open book; One page was folded down:—Spirit of grace! See! there are soils, like tear-blots, on the place! It is a prayer-book! Soon these words he read: Let him be desolate, and beg his bread! Let there be none, not one, on earth to bless,— Be his days few,—his children fatherless,— His wife a widow!—let there be no friend In his last moments mercy to extend! It was a prayer-book he before had seen: Where? when? Once more, wild terror on his mien, He read the page:—An outcast let him lie, And unlamented and forsaken die! When he has children, may they pine away Before his sight,—his wife to grief a prey. Ah! 'tis poor Mary's book!—the very same He read with her at church; and, lo! her name:— The book of Mary Banks;—when this you see, And I am dead and gone, remember me! He trembles: mark!—the dew is on his brow: The curse is hers! he cried—I feel it now! I see already, even at my right hand, Dead Mary, thy accusing spirit stand! I feel thy deep, last curse! Then, with a cry, He sunk upon the earth in agony. Feebly he rose,—when, on the matted hair Of a drowned maid, and on her bosom bare, The sun shone out; how horrid, the first glance Of sunlight, on that altered countenance! The eyes were open, but though cold and dim, Fixed with accusing ghastliness on him! Merciful God! with faltering voice he cries, Hide me! oh, hide me from the sight! Those eyes— They glare on me! oh, hide me with the dead! The curse, the deep curse rests upon my head! Alas, poor maid! 'twas frenzy fired thy breast, Which prompted horrors not to be expressed: Whilst ever at thy side the foul fiend stood, And, laughing, pointed to the oblivious flood. William, heart-stricken, to despair a prey, Soon left the village, journeying far away. For, as if Mary's ghost in judgment cried, His wife, in the first pains of child-birth, died. Who has not heard, St Cuthbert, of thy well? Perhaps the spirit may his fortunes tell. He dropped a pebble—mark! no bubble bright Comes from the bottom—turn away thy sight! He looks again: O God! those eye-balls glare How terribly! Ah, smooth that matted hair! Mary! dear Mary! thy cold corse I see Rise from the fountain! Look not thus at me! I cannot bear the sight, that form, that look! Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book! Meantime, poor Mary in the grave was laid;— Her lone and gray-haired mother wept and prayed: Soon to the dust she followed; and, unknown, There they both rest without a name or stone. The village maids, who pass in summer by, Still stop and say one prayer, for charity! But what of William? Hide me in the mine! He cried, the beams of day insulting shine! Earth's very shadows are too gay, too bright,— Hide me for ever in forgetful night! In vain—that form, the cause of all his woes, More sternly terrible in darkness rose! Nearer he saw, with its pale waving hand, The phantom in appalling stillness stand; The letters of the book shone through the night, More blasting! Hide, oh hide me from the sight! Ocean, to thee and to thy storms I bring A heart, that not the music of the spring, Nor summer piping on the rural plain, Shall ever wake to happiness again! Ocean, be mine,—wild as thy wastes, to roam From clime to clime!—Ocean, be thou my home! Some say he died: here he was seen no more; He went to sea; and oft, amid the roar Of the wild waters, starting from his sleep, He gazed upon the wild tempestuous deep; When, slowly rising from the vessel's lee, A shape appeared, which none besides could see; Then would he shriek, like one whom Heaven forsook, Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book! In foreign lands, in darkness or in light, The same dread spectre stood before his sight; If slumber came his aching lids to close, Funereal forms in long procession rose. Sometimes he dreamed that every grief was past Mary, long lost on earth, is found at last; And now she smiled as when, in early life, She lived in hope that she should be his wife; The maids are dressed in white, and all are gay, For this (he dreamed) is Mary's wedding-day! Then wherefore sad? a chill comes o'er his soul,— The sounds of mirth are hushed; and, hark! a toll!— A slow, deep toll; and lo! a sable train Of mourners, moving to the village fane. A coffin now is laid in holy ground, That, heavily, returns a hollow sound, When the first earth upon its lid is thrown: That hollow sound now changes to a groan: While, rising with wan cheek, and dripping hair, And moving lips, and eyes of ghastly glare, The spectre comes again! It comes more near! 'Tis Mary! and that book with many a tear Is wet, which, with dim fingers, long and cold, He sees her to the glimmering moon unfold. And now her hand is laid upon his heart. Gasping, he wakes—with a convulsive start, He gazes round! Moonlight is on the tide— The passing keel is scarcely heard to glide,— See where the spectre goes! with frenzied look He shrieks again, Oh! Mary, shut the book! Now, to the ocean's verge the phantom flies,— And, hark! far off, the lessening laughter dies. Years passed away,—at night, or evening close, Faint, and more faint, the accusing spectre rose. Restored from toil and perils of the main, Now William treads his native place again. Near the Land's-end, upon the rudest shore, Where, from the west, Atlantic surges roar, He lived, a lonely stranger, sad, but mild; All marked his sadness, chiefly when he smiled; Some competence he gained, by years of toil: So, in a cottage, on his native soil, He dwelt, remote from crowds, nor told his tale To human ear: he saw the white clouds sail Oft o'er the bay, when suns of summer shone, Yet still he wandered, muttering and alone. At night, when, like the tumult of the tide, Sinking to sad repose, all trouble died, The book of God was on his pillow laid, He wept upon it, and in secret prayed. He had no friend on earth, save one blue jay, Which, from the Mississippi, far away, O'er the Atlantic, to his native land He brought;—and this poor bird fed from his hand. In the great world there was not one beside For whom he cared, since his own mother died. Yet manly strength was his, for twenty years Weighed light upon his frame, though passed in tears; His age not forty-two, and in his face Of care more than of age appeared the trace. Mary was scarce remembered; by degrees, The sights and sounds of life began to please. Ruth was a widow, who, in youth, had known Griefs of the heart, and losses of her own. She, patient, mild, compassionate, and kind, First woke to human sympathies his mind. He looked affectionately, when her child Caressed his bird, and then he stood and smiled. This widow and her child, almost unknown, Lived in a cottage that adjoined his own. Her husband was a fisher, one whose life Is fraught with terror to an anxious wife: Night after night exposed upon the main; Returning, tired with toil, or drenched with rain; His gains, uncertain as his life; he knows No stated hours of labour and repose. When others to a cheerful home retire, And his wife sits before the evening fire, He, rocking in the dark, tempestuous night, Haply is thinking of that social light. Ruth's husband left the bay, the wind and rain Came down, the tempest swept the howling main; The boat sank in the storm, and he was found, Below the rocks of the dark Lizard, drowned. Seven years had passed, and after evening prayer, To William's cottage Ruth would oft repair, And with her little son would sometimes stay, Listening to tales of regions far away. The wondering boy loved of those scenes to hear— Of battles—of the roving buccaneer— Of the wild hunters, in the forest-glen, And fires, and dances of the savage men. So William spoke of perils he had passed,— Of voices heard amid the roaring blast; Of those who, lonely and of hope bereft, Upon some melancholy rock are left, Who mark, despairing, at the close of day, Perhaps, some far-off vessel sail away. He spoke with pity of the land of slaves— And of the phantom-ship that rides the waves. It comes! it comes! A melancholy light Gleams from the prow upon the storm of night. 'Tis here! 'tis there! In vain the billows roll; It steers right on, but not a living soul Is there to guide its voyage through the dark, Or spread the sails of that mysterious bark! He spoke of vast sea-serpents, how they float For many a rood, or near some hurrying boat Lift up their tall neck, with a hissing sound, And questing turn their bloodshot eye-balls round. He spoke of sea-maids, on the desert rocks, Who in the sun comb their green dripping locks, While, heard at distance, in the parting ray, Beyond the furthest promontory's bay, Aërial music swells and dies away! One night they longer stayed the tale to hear, And Ruth that night “beguiled him of a tear, Whene'er he told of the distressful stroke Which his youth suffered.” Then, she pitying spoke; And from that night a softer feeling grew, As calmer prospects rose within his view. And why not, ere the long night of the dead, The slow descent of life together tread? The day is fixed; William no more shall roam, William and Ruth shall have one heart—one home: The world shut out, both shall together pray: Both wait the evening of life's changeful day: She shall his anguish soothe, when he is wild, And he shall be a father to her child. Fair rose the morn—the summer air how bland! The blue wave scarcely seems to touch the land. Again 'tis William's wedding-day! advance— For lo! the church and blue slate of Penzance! Their faith and troth is pledged, the rites are o'er, The nuptial band winds slow along the shore, The smiling boy beside. As thus they passed, With sudden blackness rushed the impetuous blast; Deep thunder rolled in long portentous sound, At distance: nearer now, it shakes the ground. Pale, William sinks, with speechless dread oppressed, As the forked flash seems darted at his breast. His beating heart is heard,—blanched is his cheek,— A well-known voice seemed in the storm to speak; Aghast he cried again, with frantic look, Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book! By late remorse he died; for, from that day, The judgment on his head, he pined away, And soon an outcast suicide he lay. By the church-porch rests Mary of Guynear;— When the first cuckoo startles the cold year, And blue mint on her grave more beauteous grows, One small bird seems to sing for her repose. Near the Land's-end, so black and weather-beat, He lies, and the dark sea is at his feet. Thou, who hast heard the tale of the sad maid, Know, conscious guilt is the accusing shade: If thou hast loved some gentle maid and true, Whose first affections never swerved from you; Leave her not—oh! for pity and for truth, Leave her not, tearful in her days of youth! Too late, the pang of vain remorse shall start, And Conscience thus avenge—a broken heart! PART FOURTH.

The shower is past—the heath-bell, at our feet, Looks up, as with a smile, though the cold dew Hangs yet within its cup, like Pity's tear Upon the eyelids of a village child! Mark! where a light upon those far-off waves Gleams, while the passing shower above our head Sheds its last silent drops, amid the hues Of the fast-fading rainbow,—such is life! Let us go forth, the redbreast is abroad, And, dripping in the sunshine, sings again. No object on the wider sea-line meets The straining vision, but one distant ship, Hanging, as motionless and still, far off, In the pale haze, between the sea and sky. She seems the ship—the very ship I saw In infancy, and in that very place, Whilst I, and all around me, have grown old Since she was first descried; and there she sits, A solitary thing of the wide main— As she sat years ago. Yet she moves on:— To-morrow all may be one waste of waves! Where is she bound? We know not; and no voice Will tell us where. Perhaps she beats her way Slow up the channel, after many years, Returning from some distant clime, or lands, Beyond the Atlantic! Oh! what anxious eyes Count every nearer surge that heaves around! How many anxious hearts this moment beat With thronging thoughts of home, till those fixed eyes, Intensely fixed upon these very hills, Are filled with tears! Perhaps she wanders on— On—on—into the world of the vast sea, There to be lost: never, with homeward sails, Destined to greet these far-seen hills again, Now fading into mist! So let her speed, And we will pray she may return in joy, When every storm is past! Such is this sea, That shows one wandering ship! How different smile The sea-scenes of the south; and chiefly thine, Waters of loveliest Hampton, chiefly thine— Where I have passed the happiest hours of youth— Waters of loveliest Hampton! Thy gray walls, And loop-hooled battlements, cast the same shade Upon the light blue wave, as when of yore, Beneath their arch, King Canute sat, and chid The tide, that came regardless to his feet, A thousand years ago. Oh! how unlike Yon solitary sea, the summer shines, There, while a crowd of glancing vessels glide, Filled with the young and gay, and pennants wave, And sails, at distance, beautifully swell To the light breeze, or pass, like butterflies, Amid the smoking steamers. And, oh look!— Look! what a fairy lady is that yacht That turns the wooded point, and silently Streams up the sylvan Itchin; silently— And yet as if she said, as she went on, Who does not gaze at me! Yon winding sands Were solitary once, as the wide sea. Such I remember them! No sound was heard, Save of the sea-gull warping on the wind, Or of the surge that broke along the shore, Sad as the seas; and can I e'er forget, When, once, a visitor from Oxenford, Proud of Wintonian scholarship, a youth, Silent, but yet light-hearted, deeming here I could have no companion fit for him— So whispered youthful vanity—for him Whom Oxford had distinguished,—can my heart Forget when once, with thoughts like these, at morn, I wandered forth alone! The first ray shone On the white sea-gull's wing, and gazing round, I listened to the tide's advancing roar, When, for the old and booted fisherman, Who silent dredged for shrimps, in the cold haze Of sunrise, I beheld—or was it not A momentary vision?—a fair form— A female, following, with light, airy step, The wave as it retreated, and again Tripping before it, till it touched her foot, As if in play; and she stood beautiful, Like to a fairy sea-maid of the deep, Graceful, and young, and on the sands alone. I looked that she would vanish! She had left, Like me, just left the abode of discipline, And came, in the gay fulness of her heart, When the pale light first glanced along the wave, To play with the wild ocean, like a child; And though I knew her not, I vowed (oh, hear, Ye votaries of German sentiment!)— Vowed an eternal love; but, diffident, I cast a parting look, that seemed to say, Shall we ne'er meet again? The vision smiled, And left the scene to solitude. Once more We met, and then we parted, in this world To meet no more; and that fair form, that shone The vision of a moment, on the sands, Was never seen again! Now it has passed Where all things are forgotten; but it shone To me a sparkle of the morning sun, That trembled on the light wave yesterday, And perished there for ever! Look around! Above the winding reach of Severn stands, With massy fragments of forsaken towers, Thy castle, solitary Walton. Hark! Through the lone ivied arch, was it the wind Came fitful! There, by moonlight, we might stand, And deem it some old castle of romance; And on the glimmering ledge of yonder rock, Above the wave, fancy it was the form Of a spectre-lady, for a moment seen, Lifting her bloody dagger, then with shrieks Vanishing! Hush! there is no sound—no sound But of the Severn sweeping onward! Look! There is no bleeding apparition there— No fiery phantoms glare along thy walls! Surrounded by the works of silent art, And far, far more endearing, by a group Of breathing children, their possessor lives; And ill should I deserve the name of bard— Of courtly bard, if I could touch this theme Without a prayer—an earnest, heartfelt prayer, When one, whose smile I never saw but once, Yet cannot well forget, when one now blooms— Unlike the spectre-lady of the rock— A living and a lovely bride! How proud, Opposed to Walton's silent towers, how proud, With all her spires and fanes, and volumed smoke, Trailing in columns to the midday sun, Black, or pale blue, above the cloudy haze, And the great stir of commerce, and the noise Of passing and repassing wains, and cars, And sledges, grating in their underpath, And trade's deep murmur, and a street of masts And pennants from all nations of the earth, Streaming below the houses, piled aloft, Hill above hill; and every road below Gloomy with troops of coal-nymphs, seated high On their rough pads, in dingy dust serene:— How proudly, amid sights and sounds like these, Bristol, through all whose smoke, dark and aloof, Stands Redcliff's solemn fane,—how proudly girt With villages, and Clifton's airy rocks, Bristol, the mistress of the Severn sea— Bristol, amid her merchant-palaces, That ancient city sits! From out those trees, Look! Congresbury lifts its slender spire! How many woody glens and nooks of shade, With transient sunshine, fill the interval, As rich as Poussin's landscapes! Gnarled oaks, Dark, or with fits of desultory light Flung through the branches, there o'erhang the road, Where sheltered, as romantic, Brockley-Coombe Allures the lingering traveller to wind, Step by step, up its sylvan hollow, slow, Till, the proud summit gained, how gloriously The wide scene lies in light! how gloriously Sun, shadows, and blue mountains far away, Woods, meadows, and the mighty Severn blend, While the gray heron up shoots, and screams for joy! There the dark yew starts from the limestone rock Into faint sunshine; there the ivy hangs From the old oak, whose upper branches, bare, Seem as admonishing the nether woods Of Time's swift pace; while dark and deep beneath The fearful hollow yawns, upon whose edge One peeping cot sends up, from out the fern, Its early wreath of slow-ascending smoke. And who lives in that far-secluded cot? Poor Dinah! She was once a serving-maid, Most beautiful; now, on the wild wood's edge She lives alone, alone, and bowed with age, Muttering, and sad, and scarce within the sound Of human kind, forsaken as the scene! Nor pass we Fayland, with its fairy rings Marking the turf, where tiny elves may dance, Their light feet twinkling in the dewy gleam, By moonlight. But what sullen demon piled The rocks, that stern in desolation frown, Through the deep solitude of Goblin-Coombe, Where, wheeling o'er its crags, the shrilling kite More dismal makes its utter dreariness! But yonder, at the foot of Mendip, smiles The seat of cultivated Addington: And there, that beautiful but solemn church Presides o'er the still scene, where one old friend Lives social, while the shortening day unfelt Steals on, and eve, with smiling light, descends— With smiling light, that, lingering on the tower, Reminds earth's pilgrim of his lasting home. Is that a magic garden on the edge Of Mendip hung? Even so it seems to gleam; While many a cottage, on to Wrington's smoke (Wrington, the birth-place of immortal Locke), Chequers the village-crofts and lowly glens With porch of flowers, and bird-cage, at the door, That seems to say—England, with all thy crimes, And smitten as thou art by pauper-laws, England, thou only art the poor man's home! And yonder Blagdon, in its sheltered glen, Sits pensive, like a rock-bird in its cleft. The craggy glen here winds, with ivy hung, Beneath whose dark, depending tresses peeps The Cheddar-pink; there fragments of red rock Start from the verdant turf, among the flowers. And who can paint sweet Blagdon, and not think Of Langhorne, in that hermitage of song— Langhorne, a pastor, and a poet too! He, in retirement's literary bower, Oft wooed the Sisters of the sacred well, Harmonious: nor pass on without a prayer For her, associate of his early fame, Accomplished, eloquent, and pious More, Who now, with slow and gentle decadence, In the same vale, with look upraised to heaven, Waits meekly at the gate of paradise, Smiling at time! But, hark! there comes a song, Of Scotland's lakes and hills—Auld Robin Gray! Tweed, or the winding Tay, ne'er echoed words More sadly soothing; but the melody, Like some sweet melody of olden times, A ditty of past days, rose from those woods. Oh! could I hear it, as I heard it once— Sung by a maiden of the south, whose look (Although her song be sweet), whose look, and life, Are sweeter than her song—no minstrel gray, Like Donald and “the Lady of the Lake,” But would lay down his harp, and when the song Was ended, raise his lighted eyes, and smile, To thank that maiden, with a strain like this:— Oh! when I hear thee sing of “Jamie far away,” Of “father and of mother,” and of “Auld Robin Gray,” I listen till I think it is Jeanie's self I hear, And I look in thy face with a blessing and a tear. “I look in thy face,” for my heart it is not cold, Though winter's frost is stealing on, and I am growing old Those tones I shall remember as long as I live. And a blessing and a tear shall be the thanks I give. The tear it is for summers that so blithesome have been, For the flowers that all are faded, and the days that I have seen; The blessing, lassie, is for thee, whose song, so sadly sweet, Recalls the music of “Lang Syne,” to which my heart has beat. PART FIFTH. Lang syne—Return to the Deluge—Vision of the Flood—Archangel—Trump— Voice—Phantom-horse—Dove of the Ark—Dove ascending—Conclusion. The music of “Lang Syne!” Oh! long ago It died away—died, and was heard no more! And where those hills that skirt the level vale, On to the left, the prospect intercept, I would not, could not look, were they removed; I would not, could not look, lest I should see The sunshine on that spot of all the world, Where, starting from the dream of youth, I gazed Long since, on the cold, clouded world, and cried, Beautiful vision, loved, adored, in vain, Farewell—farewell, for ever! How sincere, How pure was my heart's love! oh! was it not? Yes; Heaven can witness, now my brow is changed, And I look back, and almost seem to hear The music of the days when we were young, Like music in a dream, ere we awoke, Oh! witness, Heaven, how fervent, how sincere— How fervent, and how tender, and how pure, Was my fond heart's first love! The summer eve Shone, as with sympathy of sweet farewell, Upon thy Tor, and solitary mound, Glaston, as rapidly I passed along, Borne from those scenes for ever, while with song The sorrows of the hour and way beguiled. So passed the days of youth, which ne'er return, Tearful; for worldly fortune smiled too late, And the poor minstrel-boy had then no wealth, Save such as poets dream of—love and hope. At Fortune's frown, the wreath which Hope entwined Lay withering, for the dream had been too sweet For human life; yet never, though his love, All his fond love, he muttered to the winds; Though oft he strove, distempered, without joy, To drown even the remembrance that he lived— Never a weak complaint escaped his lip, Save that some tender tones, as he passed on, Died on his desultory lyre. No more! Forget the shadows of a feverish dream, That long has passed away! Uplift the eyes To Him who sits above the water flood,— To Him who was, and is, and is to come! Wrapped in the view of ages that are passed, And marking here the record of earth's doom, Let us, even now, think that we hear the sound— The sound of the great flood, the peopled earth Covering and surging in its solitude! Let us forget the passing hour, the stir Of this tumultuous scene of human things, And bid imagination lift the veil Spread o'er the rolling globe four thousand years! The vision of the deluge! Hark—a trump! It was the trump of the Archangel! Stern He stands, whilst the awakening thunder rolls Beneath his feet! Stern, and alone, he stands Upon Imaus' height! No voice is heard Of revelry or blasphemy so high! He sounds again his trumpet; and the clouds Come deepening o'er the world! Why art thou pale? A strange and fearful stillness is on earth, As if the shadow of the Almighty passed O'er the abodes of man, and hushed at once The song, the shout, the cries of violence, The groan of the oppressed, and the deep curse Of blasphemy, that scowls upon the clouds, And mocks the deeper thunder! Hark! a voice— Perish! Again the thunder rolls; the earth Answers, from north to south, from east to west— Perish! The fountains of the mighty deep Are broken up; the rushing rains descend, Like night—deep night; while, momentary seen, Through blacker clouds, on his pale phantom-horse, Death, a gigantic skeleton, rides on, Rejoicing, where the millions of mankind— Visible, where his lightning-arrows glared— Welter beneath the shadow of his horse! Now, dismally, through all her caverns, Hell Sends forth a horrid laugh, that dies away, And then a loud voice answers—Victory! Victory to the rider and his horse! Victory to the rider and his horse! Ride on:—the ark, majestic and alone On the wide waste of the careering deep, Its hull scarce peering through the night of clouds, Is seen. But, lo! the mighty deep has shrunk! The ark, from its terrific voyage, rests On Ararat. The raven is sent forth,— Send out the dove, and as her wings far off Shine in the light, that streaks the severing clouds, Bid her speed on, and greet her with a song:— Go, beautiful and gentle dove; But whither wilt thou go? For though the clouds ride high above, How sad and waste is all below! The wife of Shem, a moment to her breast Held the poor bird, and kissed it. Many a night When she was listening to the hollow wind, She pressed it to her bosom, with a tear; Or when it murmured in her hand, forgot The long, loud tumult of the storm without. She kisses it, and at her father's word, Bids it go forth. The dove flies on! In lonely flight She flies from dawn till dark; And now, amid the gloom of night, Comes weary to the ark. Oh! let me in, she seems to say, For long and lone hath been my way! Oh! once more, gentle mistress, let me rest, And dry my dripping plumage on thy breast! So the bird flew to her who cherished it. She sent it forth again out of the ark;— Again it came at evening fall, and, lo! An olive-leaf plucked off, and in its bill. And Shem's wife took the green leaf from its bill, And kissed its wings again, and smilingly Dropped on its neck one silent tear for joy. She sent it forth once more; and watched its flight, Till it was lost amid the clouds of heaven: Then gazing on the clouds where it was lost, Its mournful mistress sung this last farewell:— Go, beautiful and gentle dove, And greet the morning ray; For, lo! the sun shines bright above, And night and storm have passed away. No longer, drooping, here confined, In this cold prison dwell; Go, free to sunshine and to wind, Sweet bird, go forth, and fare thee well! Oh! beautiful and gentle dove, Thy welcome sad will be, When thou shalt hear no voice of love, In murmurs from the leafy tree: Yet freedom, freedom shalt thou find, From this cold prison's cell; Go, then, to sunshine and the wind, Sweet bird, go forth, and fare thee well! And never more she saw it; for the earth Was dry, and now, upon the mountain's van, Again the great Archangel stands; the light Of the moist rainbow glitters on his hair— He to the bow uplifts his hands, whose arch Spans the whole heaven; and whilst, far off, in light, The ascending dove is for a moment seen, The last rain falls—falls, gently and unheard. Amid the silent sunshine! Oh! look up!— Above the clouds, borne up the depth of light, Behold a cross!—and round about the cross, Lo! angels and archangels jubilant, Till the ascending pomp in light is lost, Lift their acclaiming voice—Glory to thee, Glory, and praise, and honour be to thee, Lord God of hosts; we laud and magnify Thy glorious name, praising Thee evermore, For the great dragon is cast down, and hell Vanquished beneath thy cross, Lord Jesus Christ! Hark! the clock strikes! The shadowy scene dissolves, And all the visionary pomp is past! I only see a few sheep on the edge Of this aërial ridge, and Banwell Tower, Gray in the morning sunshine, at our feet. Farewell to Banwell Cave, and Banwell Hill, And Banwell Church; and farewell to the shores Where, when a child, I wandered; and farewell, Harp of my youth! Above this mountain-cave I leave thee, murmuring to the fitful breeze That wanders from that sea, whose sound I heard So many years ago. Yet, whilst the light Steals from the clouds, to rest upon that tower, I turn a parting look, and lift to Heaven A parting prayer, that our own Zion, thus,— With sober splendour, yet not gorgeous, Her mitred brow tempered with lenity And apostolic mildness—in her mien No dark defeature, beautiful as mild, And gentle as the smile of charity,— Thus on the Rock of Ages may uplift Her brow majestic, pointing to the spires That grace her village glens, or solemn fanes In cities, calm above the stir and smoke, And listening to deep harmonies that swell From all her temples! So may she adorn— Her robe as graceful, as her creed is pure— This happy land, till time shall be no more! And whilst her gray cathedrals rise in air, Solemn, august, and beautiful, and touched By time, to show a grace, but no decay, Like that fair pile, which, from hoar Mendip's brow, The traveller beholds, crowning the vale Of Avalon, with all its towers in light; So, England, may thy gray cathedrals lift Their front in heaven's pure light, and ever boast Such prelate-lords—bland, but yet dignified— Pious, paternal, and beloved, as he Who prompted, and forgives, this Severn song! And thou, O Lord and Saviour! on whose rock That Church is founded, though the storm without May howl around its battlements, preserve Its spirit, and still pour into the hearts Of all, who there confess thy holy name, Peace, that, through evil or through good report, They may hold on their blameless way! For me, Though disappointment, like a morning cloud, Hung on my early hopes. that cloud is passed,— Is passed, but not forgotten,—and the light Is calm, not cold, which rests upon the scene, Soon to be ended. I may wake no more The melody of song on earth; but Thee, Father of Heaven, and Saviour, at this hour, Father and Lord, I thank Thee that no song Of mine, from youth to age, has left a stain I would blot out; and grateful for the good Thy providence, through many years, has lent, Humbly I wait the close, till Thy high will Dismiss me,—blessed if, when that hour shall come, My life may plead, far better than my song. THE GRAVE OF THE LAST SAXON; OR, THE LEGEND OF THE CURFEW. INTRODUCTORY CANTO. Subject—Grave and children of Harold—Confederate army of Danes, Scottish, and English arrived in the Humber the third year of the Conqueror, and marching to York. “Know ye the land where the bright orange glows!” Oh! rather know ye not the land, beloved Of Liberty, where your brave fathers bled! The land of the white cliffs, where every cot Whose smoke goes up in the clear morning sky, On the green hamlet's edge, stands as secure As the proud Norman castle's bannered keep! Oh! shall the poet paint a land of slaves, (Albeit, that the richest colours warm His tablet, glowing from the master's hand,) And thee forget, his country—thee, his home! Fair Italy! thy hills and olive-groves A lovelier light empurples, or when morn Streams o'er the cloudless van of Apennine, Or more majestic eve, on the wide scene Of columns, temples, arches, and aqueducts, Sits, like reposing Glory, and collects Her richest radiance at that parting hour; While distant domes, touched by her hand, shine out More solemnly, 'mid the gray monuments That strew the illustrious plain; yet say, can these, Even when their pomp is proudest, and the sun Sinks o'er the ruins of immortal Rome, A holy interest wake, intense as that Which visits his full heart, who, severed long, And home returning, sees once more the light Shine on the land where his forefathers sleep; Sees its white cliffs at distance, and exclaims: There I was born, and there my bones shall rest! Then, oh! ye bright pavilions of the East, Ye blue Italian skies, and summer seas, By marble cliffs high-bounded, throwing far A gray illumination through the haze Of orient morning; ye, Etruscan shades, Where Pan's own pines o'er Valambrosa wave; Scenes where old Tiber, for the mighty dead As mourning, heavily rolls; or Anio Flings its white foam; or lucid Arno steals On gently through the plains of Tuscany; Be ye the impassioned themes of other song. Nor mine, thou wondrous Western World, to call The thunder of thy cataracts, or paint The mountains and the vast volcano range Of Cordilleras, high above the stir Of human things; lifting to middle air Their snows in everlasting solitude; Upon whose nether crags the vulture, lord Of summits inaccessible, looks down, Unhearing, when the thunder dies below! Nor, 'midst the irriguous valleys of the south, Where Chili spreads her green lap to the sea, Now pause I to admire the bright blue bird, Brightest and least of all its kind, that spins Its twinkling flight, still humming o'er the flowers, Like a gem of flitting light! To these adieu! Yet ere thy melodies, my harp, are mute For ever, whilst the stealing day goes out With slow-declining pace, I would essay One patriot theme, one ancient British song: So might I fondly dream, when the cold turf Is heaped above my head, and carping tongues Have ceased, some tones, Old England, thy green hills Might then remember. Time has reft the shrine Where the last Saxon, canonized, lay, And every trace has vanished, like the light That from the high-arched eastern window fell, With broken sunshine on his marble tomb— So have they passed; and silent are the choirs, That to his spirit sang eternal rest; And scattered are his bones who raised those walls, Where, from the field of blood slowly conveyed, His mangled corse, with torch and orison, Before the altar, and in holy earth, Was laid! Yet oft I muse upon the theme; And now, whilst solemn the slow curfew tolls, Years and dim centuries seem to unfold Their shroud, as at the summons; and I think How sad that sound on every English heart Smote, when along those darkening vales, where Lea Beneath the woods of Waltham winds, it broke First on the silence of the night, far heard Through the deep forest! Phantoms of the past, Ye gather round me! Voices of the dead, Ye come by fits! And now I hear, far off, Faint Eleesons swell, whilst to the fane The long procession, and the pomp of death, Moves visible; and now one voice is heard From a vast multitude, Harold, farewell! Farewell, and rest in peace! That sable car Bears the last Saxon to his grave; the last From Hengist, of the long illustrious line That swayed the English sceptre. Hark! a cry! 'Tis from his mother, who, with frantic mien, Follows the bier: with manly look composed, Godwin, his eldest-born, and Adela, Her head declined, her hand upon her brow Beneath the veil, supported by his arm, Sorrowing succeed! Lo! pensive Edmund there Leads Wolfe, the least and youngest, by the hand! Brothers and sisters, silent and in tears, Follow their father to the dust, beneath Whose eye they grew. Last and alone, behold, Magnus, subduing the deep sigh, with brow Of sterner acquiescence. Slowly pace The sad remains of England's chivalry, The few whom Hastings' field of carnage spared, To follow their slain monarch's hearse this night, Whose corse is borne beneath the escutcheoned pall, To rest in Waltham Abbey. So the train, Imagination thus embodies it, Moves onward to the abbey's western porch, Whose windows and retiring aisles reflect The long funereal lights. Twelve stoled monks, Each with a torch, and pacing, two and two, Along the pillared nave, with crucifix Aloft, begin the supplicating chant, Intoning “Miserere Domine.” Now the stone coffins in the earth are laid Of Harold, and of Leofrine, and Girth, Brave brethren slain in one disastrous day. And hark! again the monks and choristers Sing, pacing round the grave-stone, “Requiem Eternam dona iis.” To his grave So was King Harold borne, within those walls His bounty raised: his children knelt and wept, Then slow departed, never in this world, Perhaps, to meet again. But who is she, Her dark hair streaming on her brow, her eye Wild, and her breast deep-heaving? She beheld At distance the due rites, nor wept, nor spake, And now is gone! Alas! from that sad hour, By many fates, all who that hour had met Were scattered. Godwin, Edmund, Adela, Exiles in Denmark, there a refuge found From England's stormy fortunes. Three long years Have passed; again they tread their native land. The Danish armament beneath the Spurn Is anchored. Twenty thousand men at arms Follow huge Waltheof, on his barbed steed, His battle-axe hung at the saddle-bow; Morcar and Edwin, English earls, are there, With red-cross banner, and ten thousand men From Ely and Northumberland; they raise The death-song of defiance, and advance With bows of steel. From Scotland's mountain-glens, From sky-blue lochs, and the wild highland heaths, From Lothian villages, along the banks Of Forth, King Malcolm leads his clansmen bold, And, dauntless as romantic, bids unfurl The banner of St Andrew; by his side Mild Edgar Atheling, a stripling boy, His brother, heir to England's throne, appears; The dawn of youth on his fresh cheek; and, lo! The broadswords glitter as the tartaned troops March to the pibroch's sound. The Danish trump Brays like a gong, heard to the holts and towns Of Lincolnshire. With crests and shields the same, A lion frowning on each helmet's cone, Like the two brothers famed in ancient song, Godwin and Edmund, sons of Harold, lead From Scandinavia and the Baltic isles The impatient Northmen to the embattled host On Humber's side. The standards wave in air, Drums roll, and glittering columns file, and arms Flash to the morn, and bannered-trumpets bray, Heralds or armourers from tent to tent Are hurrying; crests, and spears, and steel-bows gleam, Far as the eye can reach; barbed horses neigh, Their mailed riders wield the battle-axe, Or draw the steel-bows with a clang; and, hark! From the vast moving host is heard one shout, Conquest or death!—as now the sun ascends, And on the bastioned walls of Ravenspur Flings its first beam—one mighty shout is heard, Perish the Norman! Soldiers, on!—to York! CANTO FIRST. Castle of Ravenspur, on the Humber—Daughter of Harold—Ailric, the monk. Let us go up to the west turret's top, Adela cried; let us go up—the night Is still, and to the east great ocean's hum Is scarcely heard. If but a wandering step, Or distant shout, or dip of hastening oar, Or tramp of steed, or far-off trumpet, break The hushed horizon, we can catch the sound When breathless expectation watches there. Upon the platform of the highest tower Of Ravenspur, beneath the lonely lamp, At midnight, leaning o'er the battlement, The daughter of slain Harold, Adela, And a gray monk who never left her side, Watched: for this night or death or victory The Saxon standard waits. Hark! 'twas a shout, And sounds at distance as of marching men! No! all is silent, save the tide, that rakes, At times, the beach, or breaks beneath the cliff. Listen! was it the fall of hastening oars? No! all is hushed! Oh! when will they return? Adela sighed; for three long nights had passed, Since her brave brothers left these bastioned walls, And marched, with the confederate host, to York. They come not: Have they perished? So dark thoughts Arose, and then she raised her look to heaven, And clasped the cross, and prayed more fervently. Her lifted eye in the pale lamp-light shone, Touched with a tear; soft airs of ocean blew Her long light hair, whilst audibly she cried, Preserve them, blessed Mary! oh! preserve My brothers! As she prayed, one pale small star, A still and lonely star, through the black night Looked out, like hope! Instant, a trumpet rang, And voices rose, and hurrying lights appeared; Now louder shouts along the platform peal— Oh! they are Normans! she exclaimed, and grasped The old man's hand, and said, Yet we will die As Harold's daughter; and, with mien and voice, Firm and unfaltering, kissed the crucifix. They knelt together, and the old man spoke: All here is toil and tempest—we shall go, Daughter of Harold, where the weary rest. Oh! holy Mary, 'tis the clank of steel Up the stone stairs! and, lo! beneath the lamp, In arms, the beaver of his helmet raised, Some light hairs straying on his ruddy cheek, With breath hastily drawn, and cheering smile, Young Atheling: The Saxon banner waves! Oh! are my brothers safe? cried Adela, Speak! speak! oh! tell me, do my brothers live? Atheling answered: They will soon appear; My post was on the eastern hills, a scout Came breathless, sent from Edmund, and I hied, With a small company, and horses fleet, At his command, to thee. He bade me say, Even now, upon the citadel of York, Above the bursting fires, and rolling smoke, The Saxon banner waves. I thank thee, Lord! My brothers live! cried Adela, and knelt Upon the platform, with uplifted hands, And look to heaven;—then rising, with a smile: We have watched, I and this old man here, Hour after hour, through the long lingering night, And now 'tis almost morning: I will stay Till I have heard my brother's distant horn From the west woods;—but you are weary, youth? Oh, no! I will keep watch with you till dawn; To me most soothing is an hour like this! And who that saw, as now, the morning stars Begin to pale, and the gray twilight steal So calmly on the seas, and wide-hushed world, Could deem there was a sound of misery On earth; nay, who could hear thy gentle voice, Fair maid, and think there was a voice of hate Or strife beneath the stillness of that cope Above us! Oh! I hate the noise of arms— Here will I watch with you. Then, after pause, Poor England is not what it once has been; And strange are both our fortunes. Atheling, (Adela answered) early piety Hath disciplined my heart to every change. How didst thou pass in safety from this land Of slavery and sorrow? He replied: When darker jealousy and lowering hate Sat on the brow of William, England mourned, And one dark spirit of conspiracy Muttered its curses through the land. 'Twas then, With fiercer glare, the lion's eye was turned On me:—My sisters and myself embarked— The wide world was before us—we embarked, With some few faithful friends, and from the sea Gazed tearful, for a moment, on the shores We left for ever (so it then appeared). Poor Margaret hid her face; but the fresh wind Swelled the broad mainsail, and the lessening land, The towers, the spires, the villages, the smoke, Were seen no more. When now at sea, the winds Blew adverse, for to Holland was our course: More fearful rose the storm; the east wind sang Louder, till wrecked upon the shores of Forth Our vessel lay. Here, friendless, we implored A short sojourn and succour. Scotland's king Then sat in Dunfermline; he heard the tale Of our distress, and flew himself to save; But when he saw my sister Margaret, Young, innocent, and beautiful in tears, His heart was moved. Oh! welcome here, he cried: 'Tis Heaven hath led you. Lady, look on me— If such a flower be cast to the bleak winds, 'Twere meet I took and wore it next my heart. Judged he not well, fair maid? Thou know'st the rest; Compassion nurtured love, and Margaret (Such are the events of ruling Providence) Is now all Scotland's queen! To join the bands Of warriors in one cause assembled here, King Malcolm left his land of hills; his arm Might make the Conqueror tremble on his throne! Even should we fail, my sister Margaret Would love and honour you; and I might hope, (Oh! might I?) on the banks of Tay or Tweed With thee to wander, where no curfew sounds, And mark the summer sun, beyond the hills, Sink in its glory, and then, hand in hand, Wind through the woods, and— Adela replied, With smile complacent, Listen; I will be (So to beguile the creeping hours of time) A tale-teller. Two years we held sojourn In Denmark; two long weary years, and sighed When, looking on the southern deep, we thought Of our poor country. Give me men and ships! Godwin still cried; oh! give me men and ships! The king commanded, and his armament— A mightier never stemmed the Baltic deep, Sent forth by sea-kings of the north, or bent On hardier enterprise; for not some isle Of the lone Orcades was now the prize, But England's throne. His mighty armament Now left the shores of Denmark. Our brave ships Burst through the Baltic straits, how gloriously! I heard the trumpets ring; I saw the sails Of nigh three hundred war-ships, the dim verge Of the remote horizon's skiey track Bestudding, here and there, like gems of light Dropped from the radiance of the morning sun On the gray waste of waters. So our ships Swept o'er the billows of the north, and steered Right on to England. Foremost of the fleet Our gallant vessel rode; around the mast Emblazoned shields were ranged, and plumed crests Shook as the north-east rose. Upon the prow, More ardent, Godwin, my brave brother, stood, And milder Edmund, on whose mailed arm I hung, when the white waves before us swelled, And parted. The broad banner, in full length, Streamed out its folds, on which the Saxon horse Ramped, as impatient on the land to leap, To which the winds still bore it bravely on; Whilst the red cross on the front banner shone, The hoar deep crimsoning. Winds, bear us on; Bear us as cheerily, till white Albion's cliffs Resound to our triumphant shouts; till there, On his own Tower, that frowns above the Thames, Even there we plant these banners and this cross, And stamp the Conqueror and his crown to dust! They would have kept me on a foreign shore; But could I leave my brothers! I with them Grew up, with them I left my native land, With them all perils have I braved, of sea Or war, all storms of hard adversity; Let death betide, I reck not; all I ask Is yet once more, in this sad world, to kneel Upon my father's grave, and kiss the earth. When the fourth morning gleamed along the deep, England, Old England! burst the general cry: England, Old England! Every eye, intent, Was turned; and Godwin pointed with his sword To Flamborough, pale rising o'er the surge. Nearer into the kingdom's heart bear on The death-storm of our vengeance! Godwin cried. Soon, like a cloud, the northern Foreland rose— Know ye those cliffs, towering in giant state! But, hark! along the shores alarum-bells Ring out more loud, blast answers blast, the swords Of hurrying horsemen, and projected spears, Flash to the sun. On yonder castle walls A thousand bows are bent; again our course Back to the north is turned. Now twilight veiled The sinking sands of Yarmouth, and we heard A long deep toll from many a village tower On shore—and, lo! the scattered inland lights, That sprinkled winding ocean's lowly verge, At once are lost in darkness. God in heaven, It is the curfew! Godwin cried, and smote His forehead. We all heard that sullen sound For the first time, that night; but the winds blew, Our ship sailed out of hearing; yet we thought Of the poor mother, who, on winter nights, When her belated husband from the wood Was not come back, her lonely taper lit, And turned the glass, and saw the faggot-flame Shine on the faces of her little ones: Those times will ne'er return. Darkness descends; Again the sun is rising o'er the waves; And now hoarse Humber roars beneath our keels, And we have landed— Yea, and struck a blow, Such as may make the crowned Conqueror quail, Edgar replied. Grant Heaven that we may live, Adela cried, in love and peace again, When every storm is past. But this good man Is silent. Ailric, does no hope, even now, Arise on thy dark heart? Good father, speak! With aspect mild, on which its fitful light The watch-tower lamp threw pale, the monk replied: Youth, on thy light hair and ingenuous brow Most comely sits the morn of life; on me, And this bare head, the night of time descends In sorrow. I look back upon the past, And think of joy and sadness upon earth, Like the vast ocean's fluctuating toil From everlasting! I have seen its waste Now in the sunshine sleeping; now high-ridged With storms; and such the kingdoms of the earth. Yes, youth, and flattering fortune, and the light Of summer days, are as the radiance That flits along the solitary waves, Even whilst we gaze, and say, How beautiful! So fitful and so perishing the dream Of human things! But there is light above, Undying; and, at times, faint harmonies Heard, by the weary pilgrim, in his way O'er perilous rocks, and through unwatered wastes, Who looks up, fainting, and prays earnestly To pass into that rest, whence sounds so sweet Come, whispering of hope; else it were best Beneath the load the forlorn heart endures To sink at once; to shut the eyes on things That sear the sight; and so to wrap the soul In sullen, tearless, ruthless apathy! Therefore, 'midst every human change, I drop A tear upon the cross, and all is calm; Yea, full of blissful and of brightest views, On this dark tide of time. Youth, thou hast known Adversity; even in thy morn of life, The springtide rainbow fades, and many days, And many years, perchance, of weal or woe Hang o'er thee! happy, if through every change Thy constant heart, thy steadfast view, be fixed Upon that better kingdom, where the crown Immortal is held out to holy hope, Beyond the clouds that rest upon the grave. Oh! I remember when King Harold stood Blooming in youth like thee; I saw him crowned— I heard the loud voice of a nation hail His rising star; then, flaming in mid-heaven The red portentous comet, like the hand Upon the wall, came forth: its fatal course All marked, and gazed in terror, as it looked With lurid light upon this land. It passed; Old men had many bodings; but I saw, Reckless, King Harold, in his plumed helm, Ride foremost of the mailed chivalry, That, when the fierce Norwegian passed the seas, Met his host man to man; I saw the sword, Advanced and glittering, in the victor's hand, That smote the Hardrada to the earth! To-day King Harold rose, like an avenging God; To-morrow (so it seemed, so short the space), To-morrow, through the field of blood, we sought His mangled corse amid the heaps of slain: Shall I recount the event more faithfully? Its spectred memory never since that hour Has left my heart. William was in his tent, Spread on the battle-plain, on that same night When seventy thousand dead lay at his feet; They who, at sunrise, with bent bows and spears, Confronted and defied him, at his feet Lay dead! Alone he watches in his tent, At midnight; 'midst a sight so terrible We came; we stood before him, where he sat, I and my brother Osgood. Who are ye? Sternly he asked; and Osgood thus replied: Conqueror, and lord, and soon to be a king, We, two poor monks of Waltham Abbey, kneel Before thee, sorrowing! He who is slain To us was bountiful. He raised those walls Where we devote our life to prayer and praise. Oh! by the mercies which the God of all Hath shewn to thee this day, grant our request; To search for his dead body, through this field Of terror, that his bones may rest with us. Your king hath met the meed of broken faith, William replied. But yet he shall not want A sepulchre; and on this very spot My purpose stands, as I have vowed to God, To build a holy monastery: here, A hundred monks shall pray for all who fell In this dread strife; and your King Harold here Shall have due honours and a stately tomb. Still on our knees, we answered, Oh! not so, Dread sovereign;—hear us, of your clemency. We beg his body; beg it for the sake Of our successors; beg it for ourselves, That we may bury it in the same spot Himself ordained when living; where the choirs May sing for his repose, in distant years, When we are dust and ashes. Then go forth, And search for him, at the first dawn of day, King William said. We crossed our breasts, and passed, Slow rising, from his presence. So we went, In silence, to the quarry of the dead. The sun rose on that still and dismal host; Toiling from corse to corse, we trod in blood, From morn till noon toiling, and then I said, Seek Editha, her whom he loved. She came; And through the field of death she passed: she looked On many a face, ghastly upturned; her hand Unloosed the helmet, smoothed the clotted hair, And many livid hands she took in hers; Till, stooping o'er a mangled corse, she shrieked, Then into tears burst audibly, and turned Her face, and with a faltering voice pronounced, Oh, Harold! We took up, and bore the corse From that sad spot, and washed the ghastly wound Deep in the forehead, where the broken barb Was fixed. So weltering from the field, we bore King Harold's corse. A hundred Norman knights Met the sad train, with pikes that trailed the ground. Our old men prayed, and spoke of evil days To come; the women smote their breasts and wept; The little children knelt beside the way, As on the Waltham the funereal car Moved slow. Few and disconsolate the train Of English earls, for few, alas! remained; So many in the field of death lay cold. The horses slowly paced, till Waltham towers Before us rose. There, with long tapered blaze, Our brethren met us, chanting, two and two, The “Miserere” of the dead. And there— But, my child Adela, you are in tears— There at the foot of the high altar lies The last of Saxon kings. Sad Editha, At distance, watched the rites, and from that hour We never saw her more. A distant trump Now rung—again!—again!—and thrice a trump Has answered from the walls of Ravenspur. My brothers! they are here! Adela cried, And left the tower in breathless ardour. York Flames to the sky! a general voice was heard— The drawbridge clanks; into the inner court A mailed man rides on—York is no more! The cry without redoubles. On the ground The rider flung his bloody sword, and raised His helm, dismounting: the first dawn of day Gleamed on the shattered plume. Oh! Adela, He cried, your brother Godwin! and she flew, And murmuring, My brave brother! hid her face, Clasping his mailed breast. Soon gazing round, She cried, But where is Edmund? Was he wont To linger? Edmund has a sacred charge, Godwin replied. But trust his anxious love, We soon shall hear his voice. I need some rest— 'Tis now broad day; but we have watched and fought: I can sleep sound, though the shrill bird of morn Mount and upbraid my slumbers with her song. Tranquil and clear the autumnal day declined: The barks at anchor cast their lengthened shades On the gray bastioned walls; airs from the deep Wandered, and touched the cordage as they passed, Then hovered with expiring breath, and stirred Scarce the quiescent pennant; the bright sea Lay silent in its glorious amplitude, Without; far up, in the pale atmosphere, A white cloud, here and there, hung overhead, And some red freckles streaked the horizon's edge, Far as the sight could reach; beneath the rocks, That reared their dark brows beetling o'er the bay, The gulls and guillemots, with short quaint cry, Just broke the sleeping stillness of the air, Or, skimming, almost touched the level main, With wings far seen, and more intensely white, Opposed to the blue space; whilst Panope Played in the offing. Humber's ocean-stream, Inland, went sounding on, by rocks and sands And castle, yet so sounding as it seemed A voice amidst the hushed and listening world That spoke of peace; whilst from the bastion's point One piping red-breast might almost be heard. Such quiet all things hushed, so peaceable The hour: the very swallows, ere they leave The coast to pass a long and weary way O'er ocean's solitude, seem to renew Once more their summer feelings, as a light So sweet would last for ever, whilst they flock In the brief sunshine of the turret-top. 'Twas at this hour of evening, Adela And Godwin, now restored by rest, went forth, Linked arm in arm, upon the eastern beach, Beyond the headland's shade. If such an hour Seemed smiling on the heart, how smiled it now To him who yesternight, a soldier, stood Amid the direst sight of human strife And bloodshed; heard the cries, the trumpet's blast, Ring o'er the dying; saw, with all its towers, A city blazing to the midnight sky, And mangled groups of miserable men, Gasping or dead, whilst with his iron heel He splashed the blood beneath! How changed the scene! The sun's last light upon the battlements, The sea, the landscape, the peace-breathing air, Remembered both of the departed hours Of early life, when once they had a home, A country, where their father wore a crown. What changes since that time, for them and all They loved! how many found an early grave, Cut off by the red sword! how many mourned, Scattered by various fates, through distant lands! How desolate their own poor country, bound By the oppressor's chain! As thoughts like these Arose, the bells of rural Nevilthorpe Rang out a joyous peal, rang merrily, For tidings heard from York: their melody Mingled with things forgotten. Until then, And then remembered freshly, Adela That instant turned to hide her tears, and saw Her brother Edmund leading by the hand A boy of lovely mien and footstep light Along the sands. My sister, Edmund cried, See here a footpage I have brought from York To serve a lady fair! The boy held out His hand to Adela, as he would say, Look, and protect me, lady. Adela, Advancing with a smile and glowing cheek, Cried, Welcome, truant brother; and then took The child's right hand, and said, My pretty page, And have you not a tale to tell to me? The boy spake nothing, but looked earnestly And anxiously at Edmund. Edmund said, If he is silent, I must speak for him. 'Twas when the minster flamed, and, sword in hand, Godwin, and Waltheof, and stern Hereward, Directed the red slaughter; black with smoke I burst into the citadel, and saw, Not the grim warder, with his huge axe up, But o'er her child, a frantic mother, mute With horror, in delirious agony, Clasping it to her bosom; stern and still The father stood, his hand upon his brow, As praying, in that hour, that God might make, In mercy, the last trial brief. Fear not— I am a man—nay, fear not me, I cried, And seizing this child's hand, in safety placed, Amidst the smoke, and sounds and sights of death, Him and his mother! She with bursting heart Knelt down to bless me: when I saw that boy, So beautiful, I thought of Adela, And said, Oh! trust with his preserver him Whom every eye must view with tender love, Oh! trust me; for his safety, lo! I pledge My honour and my life. And I have brought My trusted charge, that you, my Adela, May show him gentler courtesy than those Whom war in its stern trade has almost steeled. His sister kissed the child's light hair and cheek, And folded his small hands in hers, and said, You shall be my true knight, and wear a plume, Wilt thou not, boy; and for a lady's love Fight, like a valiant soldier? I will die, The poor child said, for friends like those who saved My father and my mother; and again Adela kissed his forehead and his eyes, And said, But we are Saxons! As she spoke, The winds began to muster, and the sea Swelled with a sound more solemn, whilst the sun Was sinking, and its last and lurid light Streaked the long line of cumbrous clouds, that hung In wild red masses o'er the murmuring deep, Now flickering fast with foam. The sea-fowl flew Rapidly on, o'er the black-lifted surge, Borne down the wind, and then was seen no more. Meantime the dark deep wilder heaves, and, hark! Heavily overhead the gathered storm Comes sounding! Haste!—and in the castle-keep List to the winds and waves that roar without. CANTO SECOND. Waltham Forest—Tower—William and his Barons. There had been fearful sounds in the air last night In the wild wolds of Holderness, when York Flamed to the midnight sky, and spells of death Were heard amidst the depth of Waltham woods; For there the wan and weird sisters met Their imps, and the dark spirits that rejoice When foulest deeds are done on earth, and there In dread accordance rose their dismal joy. SPIRITS AND NIGHT-HAGS. Around, around, around, Troop and dance we to the sound, Whilst mocking imps cry, Ho! ho! ho! On earth there will be woe! more woe! SPIRIT OF THE EARTHQUAKE. Arise, swart fiends, 'tis I command; Burst your caves, and rock the land. SPIRIT OF THE STORM. Loud tempests, sweep the conscious wood! SPIRIT OF THE BATTLE. I scent from earth more blood! more blood! SPIRIT OF THE FIRE. When the wounded cry, And the craven die, I will ride on the spires, And the red volumes of the bursting fires. SPIRITS AND NIGHT-HAGS. Around, around, around, Dance we to the dismal sound Of dying cries and mortal woe, Whilst mocking imps shout, Ho! ho! ho! FIRST SPIRIT. Hear! Spirits that our 'hests perform In the earthquake or the storm, Appear, appear! A fire is lighted—the pale smoke goes up; Obscure, terrific features through the clouds Are seen, and a wild laughter heard, We come! FIRST MINISTERING SPIRIT. I have syllables of dread; They can wake the dreamless dead. SECOND SPIRIT. I, a dark sepulchral song, That can lead hell's phantom-throng. THIRD SPIRIT. Like a nightmare I will rest This night upon King William's breast! SPIRITS AND NIGHT-HAGS. Around, around, around, Dance we to the dismal sound Of dying shrieks and mortal woe, Whilst antic imps shout, Ho! ho! ho! They vanished, and the earth shook where they stood. That night, King William first within the Tower Received his vassal barons; in that Tower Which oft since then has echoed to night-shrieks Of secret murder, or the lone lament. Now other sounds were heard, for on this night Its canopied and vaulted chambers rang With minstrelsy; whilst sounds of long acclaim Re-echoed, from the loopholes, o'er the Thames: The drawbridge, and the ponderous cullis-gate, Frowned on the moat; the flanking towers aspired O'er the embattled walls, where proudly waved The Norman banner. William, laugh to scorn The murmurs of conspiracy and hate That round thee gather, like the storms of night Mustering, when murder hides her visored mien! Now, what hast thou to fear! Let the fierce Dane Into the centre of thy kingdom sweep, With hostile armament, even like the tide Of the hoarse Humber, on whose waves he rode! Let foes confederate; let one voice of hate, One cry of instant vengeance, one deep curse Be heard, from Waltham woods to Holderness! Let Waltheof, stern in steel; let Hereward, Impatient as undaunted, flash their swords; Let the boy Edgar, backed by Scotland's king, Advance his feeble claim, and don his casque, Whose brows might better a blue bonnet grace; Let Edwin and vindictive Morcar join The sons of Harold,—what hast thou to fear? London's sole Tower might laugh their strength to scorn! Upon that night when York's proud castle fell, Here William held his court. The torches glared On crest and crozier. Knights and prelates bowed Before their sovereign. He, his knights and peers Surveying with a stern complacency, Inclined not from his seat, o'ercanopied With golden valance, woven by no hand, Save of the Queen. Yet calm his countenance Shone, and his brow a dignified repose Marked kingly; high his forehead, and besprent With dark hair, interspersed with gray; his eye Glanced amiable, chiefly when the light Of a brief smile attempered majesty. His beard was dark and heavy, yet diffused, Low as the lion ramping on his breast Engrailed upon the mail. Odo approached, And knelt, then rising, placed the diadem Upon his brow, with laurels intertwined. Again the voice of acclamation rang, And from the galleries a hundred harps Resounded Roland's song! Long live the King! The barons, and the prelates, and the knights, Long live the Conqueror! cried; a god on earth! That instant the high vaulted chamber shook As with a blast from heaven, and all was mute Around him, and the very fortress rocked, As it would topple on their heads. He rose Disturbed and frowning, for tumultuous thoughts Crowded like night upon his heart; then waved His hand. The barons, abbots, knights retire. Behold him now alone! before a lamp A crucifix appears; upon the ground Lies the same sword that Hastings' battle dyed Deep to the hilt in gore; behold, he kneels And prays, Thou only, Lord, art ever great; Have mercy on my sins! The crucifix Shook as he spoke, shook visibly, and, hark! There is a low moan, as of dying men, At distance heard. Then William first knew fear. He had heard tumults of the battle-field, The noise, the glorious hurrahs, and the clang Of trumpets round him, but no sound like this Ere smote with unknown terror on his heart, As if the eye of God that moment turned And saw it beating. Rising slow, he flung Upon a couch his agitated limbs; The lamp was near him; on the ground his sword And helmet lay; short troubled slumbers stole, And darkly rose the spirit of his dream. He saw a field of blood,—it passed away; A glittering palace rose, with mailed men Thronged, and the voice of multitudes was heard Acclaiming: suddenly the sounds had ceased, The glittering palace vanished, and, behold! Long winding cloisters, echoing to the chant Of stoled fathers; and the mass-song ceased— Then a dark tomb appeared, and, lo! a shape As of a phantom-king! Nearer it came, And nearer yet, in silence, through the gloom. Advancing—still advancing: the cold glare Of armour shone as it approached, and now It stands o'er William's couch! The spectre gazed A while, then lifting its dark visor up— Horrible vision!—shewed a grisly wound Deep in its forehead, and therein appeared Gouts, as yet dropping from an arrow's point Infixed! And that red arrow's deadly barb The shadow drew, and pointed at the breast Of William; and the blood dropped on his breast; And through his steely arms one drop of blood Came cold as death's own hand upon his heart! Whilst a deep voice was heard, Now sleep in peace, I am avenged! Starting, he exclaimed, Hence, horrid phantom! Ho! Fitzalain, ho! Montgomerie! Each baron, with a torch, Before him stood. By dawn of day, he cried, We will to horse. What passes in our thoughts We shall unfold hereafter. By St Anne, Albeit, not ten thousand phantoms sent By the dead Harold can divert our course, They may bear timely warning. 'Tis yet night— Give me a battle-song ere daylight dawns; The song of Roland, or of Charlemagne— Or our own fight at Hastings. Torches! ho! And let the gallery blaze with lights! Awake, Harpers of Normandy, awake! By Heaven, I will not sleep till your full chords ring out The song of England's conquest! Torches! ho! He spoke. Again the blazing gallery Echoed the harpers' song. Old Eustace led The choir, and whilst the king paced to and fro, Thus rose the bold, exulting symphony. SONG OF THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS. The Norman armament beneath thy rocks, St Valerie, Is moored; and, streaming to the morn, three hundred banners fly, Of crimson silk; with golden cross, effulgent o'er the rest, That banner, proudest in the fleet, streams, which the Lord had blessed. The gale is fair, the sails are set, cheerily the south wind blows, And Norman archers, all in steel, have grasped their good yew-bows; Aloud the harpers strike their harps, whilst morning light is flung Upon the cross-bows and the shields, that round the masts are hung. Speed on, ye brave! 'tis William leads; bold barons, at his word, Lo! sixty thousand men of might for William draw the sword. So, bound to England's southern shore, we rolled upon the seas, And gallantly the white sails set were, and swelling to the breeze. On, on, to victory or death! now rose the general cry; The minstrels sang, On, on, ye brave, to death or victory! Mark yonder ship, how straight she steers; ye knights and barons brave, 'Tis William's ship, and proud she rides, the foremost o'er the wave. And now we hailed the English coast, and, lo! on Beachy Head, The radiance of the setting sun majestical is shed. The fleet sailed on, till, Pevensey! we saw thy welcome strand; Duke William now his anchor casts, and dauntless leaps to land. The English host, by Harold led, at length appear in sight, And now they raise a deafening shout, and stand prepared for fight; The hostile legions halt a while, and their long lines display, Now front to front they stand, in still and terrible array. Give out the word, God, and our right! rush like a storm along, Lift up God's banner, and advance, resounding Roland's song! Ye spearmen, poise your lances well, by brave Montgomerie led, Ye archers, bend your bows, and draw your arrows to the head. They draw—the bent bows ring—huzzah! another flight, and hark! How the sharp arrowy shower beneath the sun goes hissing dark. Hark! louder grows the deadly strife, till all the battle-plain Is red with blood, and heaped around with men and horses slain. On, Normans, on! Duke William cried, and Harold, tremble thou, Now think upon thy perjury, and of thy broken vow. The banner of thy armed knight, thy shield, thy helm are vain— The fatal shaft has sped,—by Heaven! it hisses in his brain! So William won the English crown, and all his foemen beat, And Harold, and his Britons brave, lay silent at his feet. Enough! the day is breaking, cried the King: Away! away! be armed at my side, Without attendants, and to horse, to horse! CANTO THIRD. Waltham Abbey and Forest—Wild Woman of the Woods. At Waltham Abbey, o'er King Harold's grave A requiem was chanted; for last night A passing spirit shook the battlements, And the pale monk, at midnight, as he watched The lamp, beheld it tremble; whilst the shrines Shook, as the deep foundations of the fane Were moved. Oh! pray for Harold's soul! he cried. And now, at matin bell, the monks were met, And slowly pacing round the grave, they sang: DIRGE. Peace, oh! peace, be to the shade Of him who here in earth is laid: Saints and spirits of the blessed, Look upon his bed of rest; Forgive his sins, propitious be; Dona pacem, Domine, Dona pacem, Domine! When, from yonder window's height, The moonbeams on the floor are bright, Sounds of viewless harps shall die, Sounds of heaven's own harmony! Forgive his sins, propitious be; Dona pacem, Domine, Dona pacem, Domine! By the spirits of the brave, Who died the land they loved to save; By the soldier's faint farewell, By freedom's blessing, where he fell; Forgive his sins, propitious be; Dona pacem, Domine, Dona pacem, Domine! By a nation's mingled moan, By liberty's expiring groan, By the saints, to whom 'tis given To bear that parting groan to heaven; To his shade propitious be; Dona pacem, Domine, Dona pacem, Domine! The proud and mighty— As they sung, the doors Of the west portal, with a sound that shook The vaulted roofs, burst open; and, behold! An armed Norman knight, the helmet closed Upon his visage, but of stature tall, His coal-black armour clanking as he trod, Advancing up the middle aisle alone, Approached: he gazed in silence on the grave Of the last Saxon; there a while he stood, Then knelt a moment, muttering a brief prayer: The fathers crossed their breasts—the mass-song ceased; Heedless of all around, the mailed man Rose up, nor speaking, nor inclining, paced Back through the sounding aisle, and left the fane. The monks their interrupted song renewed: The proud and mighty, when they die, With the crawling worm shall lie; But who would not a crown resign, Harold, for a rest like thine! Saviour Lord, propitious be; Dona pacem, Domine, Dona pacem, Domine! “Pacem” (as slow the stoled train retire), “Pacem” the shrines and fretted roofs returned. 'Twas told, three Norman knights, in armour, spurred Their foaming steeds to the West Abbey door; But who it was, that with his visor closed Passed up the long and echoing fane alone, And knelt on Harold's gravestone, none could tell. The stranger knights in silence left the fane, And soon were lost in the surrounding shades Of Waltham forest. He who foremost rode Passed his companions, on his fleeter steed, And, muttering in a dark and dreamy mood, Spurred on alone, till, looking round, he heard Only the murmur of the woods above, Whilst soon all traces of a road were lost In the inextricable maze. From morn Till eve, in the wild woods he wandered lost. Night followed, and the gathering storm was heard Among the branches. List! there is no sound Of horn far off, or tramp of toiling steed, Or call of some belated forester; No lonely taper lights the waste; the woods Wave high their melancholy boughs, and bend Beneath the rising tempest. Heard ye not Low thunder to the north! The solemn roll Redoubles through the darkening forest deep, That sounds through all its solitude, and rocks, As the long peal at distance rolls away. Hark! the loud thunder crashes overhead; And, as the red fire flings a fitful glare, The branches of old oaks, and mossy trunks, Distinct and visible shine out; and, lo! Interminable woods, a moment seen, Then lost again in deeper, lonelier night. The torrent rain o'er the vast leafy cope Comes sounding, and the drops fall heavily Where the strange knight is sheltered by the trunk Of a huge oak, whose dripping branches sweep Far round. Oh! happy, if beneath the flash Some castle's bannered battlements were seen, Where the lone minstrel, as the storm of night Blew loud without, beside the blazing hearth Might dry his hoary locks, and strike his harp (The fire relumined in his aged eyes) To songs of Charlemagne! Or, happier yet If some gray convent's bell remote proclaimed The hour of midnight service, when the chant Was up, and the long range of windows shone Far off on the lone woods; whilst Charity Might bless and welcome, in a night like this, The veriest outcast! Angel of the storm, Ha! thy red bolt this instant shivering rives That blasted oak! The horse starts back, and bounds From the knight's grasp. The way is dark and wild; As dark and wild as if the solitude Had never heard the sound of human steps. Pondering he stood, when, by the lightning's glance, The knight now marked a small and craggy path Descending through the woody labyrinth. He tracked his way slowly from brake to brake, Till now he gained a deep sequestered glen. I fear not storms, nor thunders, nor the sword, The knight exclaimed: that eye alone I fear, God's stern and steadfast eye upon the heart! Yet peace is in the grave where Harold sleeps. Who speaks of Harold? cried a woman's voice, Heard through the deep night of the woods. He spoke, A stern voice answered, he of Harold spoke, Who feared his sword in the red front of war, Less than the powers of darkness: and he crossed His breast, for at that instant rose the thought Of the weird sisters of the wold, that mock Night wanderers, and “syllable men's names” In savage solitude. If now, he cried, Dark minister, thy spells of wizard power Have raised the storm and wild winds up, appear! He scarce had spoken, when, by the red flash That glanced along the glen, half visible, Uprose a tall, majestic female form: So visible, her eyes' intenser light Shone wildly through the darkness; and her face, On which one pale flash more intently shone, Was like a ghost's by moonlight, as she stood A moment seen: her lips appeared to move, Muttering, whilst her long locks of ebon hair Streamed o'er her forehead, by the bleak winds blown Upon her heaving breast. The knight advanced; The expiring embers from a cave within, Now wakened by the night-air, shot a light, Fitful and trembling, and this human form, If it were human, at the entrance stood, As seemed, of a rude cave. You might have thought She had strange spells, such a mysterious power Was round her; such terrific solitude, Such night, as of the kingdom of the grave; Whilst hurricanes seemed to obey her 'hest. And she no less admired, when, front to front, By the rekindling ember's darted gleam, A mailed man, of proud illustrious port, She marked; and thus, but with unfaltering voice, She spake: Yes! it was Harold's name I heard! Whence, and what art thou? I have watched the night, And listened to the tempest as it howled; And whilst I listening lay, methought I heard, Even now, the tramp as of a rushing steed; Therefore I rose, and looked into the dark, And now I hear one speak of Harold: say, Whence, and what art thou, solitary man? If lost and weary, enter this poor shed; If wretched, pray with me; if on dark deeds Intent, I am a most poor woman, cast Into the depths of mortal misery! The desolate have nought to lose:—pass on! I had not spoken, but for Harold's name, By thee pronounced: it sounded in my ears As of a better world—ah, no! of days Of happiness in this. Whence, who art thou? I am a Norman, woman; more to know Seek not:—and I have been to Harold's grave, Remembering that the mightiest are but dust; And I have prayed the peace of God might rest Upon his soul. And, by our blessed Lord, The deed was holy, that lone woman said; And may the benediction of all saints, Whoe'er thou art, rest on thy head. But say, What perilous mischance hath hither led Thy footsteps in an hour and night like this? Over his grave, of whom we spake, I heard The mass-song sung. I knelt upon that grave, And prayed for my own sins. I left the fane, And heard the chanted rite at distance die. Returning through these forest shades, with thoughts Not of this world, I pressed my panting steed, The foremost of the Norman knights, and passed The track, that, leading to the forest-ford, Winds through the opening thickets; on a height I stood and listened, but no voice replied: The storm descended; at the lightning's flash My good steed burst the reins, and frantic fled. I was alone: the small and craggy path Led to this solitary glen; and here, As dark and troubled thoughts arose, I mused Upon the dead man's sleep; for God, I thought, This night spoke in the rocking of the winds! There is a Judge in heaven, the woman said, Who seeth all things; and there is a voice, Inaudible 'midst the tumultuous world, That speaks of fear or comfort to the heart When all is still! But shroud thee in this cave Till morning: such a sojourn may not please A courtly knight, like echoing halls of joy. I have but some wild roots, a bed of fern, And no companion save this bloodhound here, Who, at my beck, would tear thee to the earth; Yet enter—fear not! And that poor abode The proud knight entered, with rain-drenched plume. Yet here I dwell in peace, the woman said, Remote from towns, nor start at the dire sound Of that accursed curfew! Soldier-knight, Thou art a Norman! Had the invader spurned All charities in thy own native land, Yes, thou wouldst know what injured Britons feel! Nay, Englishwoman, thou dost wrong our king, The knight replied: conspiracy and fraud Hourly surrounding him, at last compelled Stern rigour to awake. What! shall the bird Of thunder slumber on the citadel, And blench his eye of fire, when, looking down, He sees, in ceaseless enmity combined, Those who would pluck his feathers from his breast, And cast them to the winds! Woman, on thee, Haply, the tempest of the times has beat Too roughly; but thy griefs he can requite. The indignant woman answered, He requite! Can he bring back the dead? Can he restore Joy to the broken-hearted? He requite! Can he pour plenty on the vales his frown Has blasted, bid sweet evening hear again The village pipe, and the fair flowers revive His bloody footstep crushed? For poverty, I reck it not: what is to me the night, Spent cheerless, and in gloom and solitude? I fix my eye upon that crucifix, I mourn for those that are not—for my brave, My buried countrymen! Of this no more! Thou art a foe; but a brave soldier-knight Would scorn to wrong a woman; and if death Could arm my hand this moment, thou wert safe In a poor cottage as in royal halls. Here rest a while till morning dawns—the way No mortal could retrace:—'twill not be long, And I can cheat the time with some old strain; For, Norman though thou art, thy soul has felt Even as a man, when sacred sympathy This morning led thee to King Harold's grave. The woman sat beside the hearth, and stirred The embers, or with fern or brushwood raised A fitful flame, but cautious, lest its light Some roving forester might mark. At times, The small and trembling blaze shone on her face, Still beautiful, and showed the dark eye's fire Beneath her long black locks. When she stood up, A dignity, though in the garb of want, Seemed round her, chiefly when the brushwood-blaze Glanced through the gloom, and touched the dusky mail Of the strange knight; then with sad smile she sung: Oh! when 'tis summer weather, And the yellow bee, with fairy sound, The waters clear is humming round, And the cuckoo sings unseen, And the leaves are waving green— Oh! then 'tis sweet, In some remote retreat, To hear the murmuring dove, With those whom on earth alone we love, And to wind through the greenwood together. But when 'tis winter weather, And crosses grieve, And friends deceive, And rain and sleet The lattice beat,— Oh! then 'tis sweet To sit and sing Of the friends with whom, in the days of spring, We roamed through the greenwood together. The bloodhound slept upon the hearth; he raised His head, and, through the dusk, his eyes were seen, Fiery, a moment; but again he slept, When she her song renewed. Though thy words might well deceive me— That is past—subdued I bend; Yet, for mercy, do not leave me To the world without a friend! Oh! thou art gone! and would, with thee, Remembrance too had fled! She lives to bid me weep, and see The wreath I cherished dead. The knight, through the dim lattice, watched the clouds Of morn, now slowly struggling in the east, When, with a voice more thrilling, and an air Wilder, again a sad song she intoned: Upon the field of blood, Amidst the bleeding brave, O'er his pale corse I stood— But he is in his grave! I wiped his gory brow, I smoothed his clotted hair— But he is at peace, in the cold ground now; Oh! when shall we meet there? At once, horns, trumpets, and the shouts of men, Were heard above the valley. At the sound, The knight, upstarting from his dreamy trance, High raised his vizor, and his bugle rang, Answering. By God in heaven, thou art the king! The woman said. Again the clarions rung: Like lightning, Alain and Montgomerie Spurred through the wood, and led a harnessed steed To the lone cabin's entrance, whilst the train Sent up a deafening shout, Long live the king! He, ere he vaulted to the saddle-bow, Turned with a look benevolent, and cried, Barons and lords, to this poor woman here Haply I owe my life! Let her not need! Away! she cried, king of these realms, away! I ask not wealth nor pity—least from thee, Of all men. As the day began to dawn, More fixed and dreadful seemed her steadfast look; The long black hair upon her labouring breast Streamed, whilst her neck, as in disdain, she raised, Swelling, her eyes a wild terrific light Shot, and her voice, with intonation deep, Uttered a curse, that even the bloodhound crouched Beneath her feet, whilst with stern look she spoke: Yes! I am Editha! she whom he loved— She whom thy sword has left in solitude, How desolate! Yes, I am Editha! And thou hast been to Harold's grave—oh! think, King, where thy own will be! He rests in peace; But even a spot is to thy bones denied; I see thy carcase trodden under foot; Thy children—his, with filial reverence, Still think upon the spot where he is laid, Though distant and far severed—but thy son, Thy eldest born, ah! see, he lifts the sword Against his father's breast! Hark, hark! the chase Is up! in that wild forest thou hast made! The deer is flying—the loud horn resounds— Hurrah! the arrow that laid Harold low, It flies, it trembles in the Red King's heart! Norman, Heaven's hand is on thee, and the curse Of this devoted land! Hence, to thy throne! The king a moment with compassion gazed, And now the clarions, and the horns, and trumps Rang louder; the bright banners in the winds Waved beautiful; the neighing steeds aloft Mantled their manes, and up the valley flew, And soon have left behind the glen, the cave Of solitary Editha, and sounds Of her last agony! Montgomerie, King William, turning, cried, when this whole land Is portioned (for till then we may not hope For lasting peace) forget not Editha. In the gray beam the spires of London shone, And the proud banner on the bastion Of William's tower was seen above the Thames, As the gay train, slow winding through the woods, Approached; when, lo! with spurs of blood, and voice Faltering, upon a steed, whose labouring chest Heaved, and whose bit was wet with blood and froth, A courier met them. York, O king! he cried, York is in ashes!—all thy Normans slain! Now, by the splendour of the throne of God, King William cried, nor woman, man, nor child, Shall live! Terrific flashed his eye of fire, And darker grew his frown; then, looking up, He drew his sword, and with a vow to Heaven, Amid his barons, to the trumpet's clang Rode onward (breathing vengeance) to the Tower. CANTO FOURTH. Wilds of Holderness—Hags—Parting on the Humber—Waltham Abbey, and Grave—Conclusion. The moon was high, when, 'mid the wildest wolds Of Holderness, where erst that structure vast, An idol-temple, in old heathen times, Frowned with gigantic shadow to the moon, That oft had heard the dark song and the groans Of sacrifice, There the wan sisters met; They circled the rude stone, and called the dead, And sung by turns their more terrific song: FIRST HAG. I looked in the seer's prophetic glass, And saw the deeds that should come to pass; From Carlisle-Wall to Flamborough Head, The reeking soil was heaped with dead. SECOND HAG. The towns were stirring at dawn of day, And the children went out in the morn to play; The lark was singing on holt and hill; I looked again, but the towns were still; The murdered child on the ground was thrown, And the lark was singing to heaven alone. THIRD HAG. I saw a famished mother lie, Her lips were livid, and glazed her eye; The tempest was rising, and sang in the south, And I snatched the blade of grass from her mouth. FOURTH HAG. By the rolling of the drums, Hitherward King William comes! The night is struggling with the day— Hags of darkness, hence! away! William is in the north; the avenging sword Descended like a whirlwind where he passed; Slaughter and Famine at his bidding wait, Like lank, impatient bloodhounds, till he cries, Pursue! Again the Norman banner floats Triumphant on the citadel of York, Where, circled with the blazonry of arms, Amid his barons, William holds his state. The boy preserved from death, young Malet, kneels, With folded hands; his father, mother kneel, Imploring clemency for Harold's sons; For Edmund most. Bareheaded Waltheof bends, And yields the keys! A breathless courier comes: What tidings? O'er the seas the Danes are fled; Morcar and Edwin in Northumberland, Amidst its wildest mountains, seek to hide Their broken hopes—their troops are all dispersed. Malcolm alone, and the boy Atheling, And the two sons of the dead Harold, wait The winds to bear them to the North away. Bid forth a thousand spearmen, William cried: Now, by the resurrection, and the throne Of God, King Malcolm shall repent the hour He ere drew sword in England! Hence! away! The west wind blows, the boat is on the beach, The clansmen all embarked, the pipe is heard, Whilst thoughtful Malcolm and young Atheling Linger the last upon the shore; and there Are Harold's children, the gray-headed monk, Godwin, and Edmund, and poor Adela. Then Malcolm spoke: The lot is cast! oh, fly From this devoted land, and live with us, Amidst our lakes and mountains! Adela, Atheling whispered, does thy heart say Yes? For in this world we ne'er may meet again. The brief hour calls—come, Adela, exclaimed Malcolm, and kindly took her hand. She looked To heaven, and fell upon her knees, then rose, And answered: Sire, when my brave father fell, We three were exiles on a distant shore; And never, or in solitude or courts, Was God forgotten—all is in his hand. When those whom I had loved from infancy Here joined the din of arms, I came with them; With them I have partaken good and ill, Have in the self-same mother's lap been laid, The same eye gazed on us with tenderness, And the same mother prayed prosperity Might still be ours through life! Alas! our lot How different! Yet let them go with you, I argue not—the first time in our lives, If it be so, we here shall separate; Whatever fate betide, I will not go Till I have knelt upon my father's grave! 'Tis perilous to think, Atheling cried, Most perilous—how 'scape the Norman's eye? She turned, and with a solemn calmness said: If we should perish, at the hour of death My father will look down from heaven, and say, Come, my poor child! oh, come where I am blessed! My brothers, seek your safety. Here I stand Resolved; and never will I leave these shores Till I have knelt upon my father's grave! We never will forsake thee! Godwin cried. Let death betide, said Edmund, we will go, Yes! go with thee, or perish! As he spoke, The pilot gave the signal. Then farewell! King Malcolm cried, friends lately met, and now To part for ever! and he kissed the cheek Of Adela, and took brave Godwin's hand And Edmund's, and then said, almost in tears, It is not now too late! yet o'er my grave So might a duteous daughter weep! God speed Brave Malcolm to his father's land! they cried. The ships beyond the promontory's point Were anchored, and the tide was ebbing fast. Then Ailric: Sire, not unforeseen by me Was this sad day. Oh! King of Scotland, hear! I was a brother of that holy house Where Harold's bones are buried; from my vows I was absolved, and followed—for I loved His children—followed them through every fate. My few gray hairs will soon descend in peace, When I shall be forgotten; but till then, My services, my last poor services, To them I have devoted, for the sake Of him, their father, and my king, to whom All in this world I owed! Protect them, Lord, And bless them, when the turf is on my head; And, in their old age, may they sometimes think Of Ailric, cold and shrouded in his grave, When summer smiles! Sire, listen whilst I pray One boon of thy compassion: not for me— I reck not whether vengeance wake or sleep— But for the safety of this innocent maid I speak. South of the Humber, in a cave, Concealed amidst the rocks and tangled brakes, I have deposited some needful weeds For this sad hour; for well, indeed, I knew, If all should fail, this maiden's last resolve, To kneel upon her father's grave, or die. For this I have provided; but the time Is precious, and the sun is westering slow; The fierce eye of the lion may be turned Upon this spot to-morrow! Adela, Now hear your friend, your father! The fleet hour Is passing, never to return: oh, seize The instant! Thou, King Malcolm, grant my prayer! If we embark, and leave the shores this night, The voice of fame will bruit it far and wide, That Harold's children fled with thee, and sought A refuge in thy kingdom. None will know Our destination. In thy boat conveyed, We may be landed near the rocky cave; The boat again ply to thy ships, and they Plough homeward the north seas, whilst we are left To fate. Again the pilot's voice was heard; And, o'er the sand-hills, an approaching file Of Norman soldiers, with projected spears, Already seemed as rushing on their prey. Then Ailric took the hand of Adela; She and her brothers, and young Atheling, And Scotland's king, are in one boat embarked. Meantime the sun sets red, and twilight shades The sinking hills. The solitary boat Has reached the adverse shore. Here, then, we part! King Malcolm said; and every voice replied, God speed brave Malcolm to his father's land! Ailric, the brothers, and their sister, left The boat; they stood upon the moonlit beach, Still listening to the sounds, as they grew faint, Of the receding oars, and watching still If one white streak at distance, as they dipped, Were seen, till all was solitude around. Pensive, they sought a refuge for that night In the bleak ocean-cave. The morning dawns; The brothers have put off the plumes of war, Dropping one tear upon the sword. Disguised In garb to suit their fortunes, they appear Like shipwrecked seamen of Armorica, By a Franciscan hermit through the land Led to St Alban's shrine, to offer vows, Vows to the God who heard them in that hour When all beside had perished in the storm. Wrecked near his ocean-cave, an eremite (So went the tale of their disastrous fate) Sustained them, and now guides them through a land Of strangers. That fair boy was wont to sing Upon the mast, when the still ship went slow Along the seas, in sunshine; and that garb Conceals the lovely, light-haired Adela. The cuckoo's note in the deep woods was heard When forth they fared. At many a convent gate They stood and prayed for shelter, and their pace Hastened, if, high amid the clouds, they marked Some solitary castle lift its brow Gray in the distance—hastened, so to reach, Ere it grew dark, its hospitable towers. There the lithe minstrel sung his roundelay: Listen, lords and ladies bright! I can sing of many a knight Who fought in paynim lands afar; Of Bevis, or of Iscapar. I have tales of wandering maids, And fairy elves in haunted glades, Of phantom-troops that silent ride By the moonlit forest's side. I have songs (fair maidens, hear!) To warn the lovelorn lady's ear. The choice of all my treasures take, And grant us food for pity's sake! When tired, at noon, by the white waterfall, In some romantic and secluded glen, They sat, and heard the blackbird overhead Singing, unseen, a song, such as they heard In infancy. So every vernal morn Brought with it scents of flowers, or songs of birds, Mingled with many shapings of old things, And days gone by. Then up again, to scale The airy mountain, and behold the plain Stretching below, and fading far away, How beautiful; yet still to feel a tear Starting, even when it shone most beautiful, To think, Here, in the country of our birth, No rest is ours! On, to our father's grave! So southward through the country they had passed Now many days, and casual shelter found In villages, or hermit's lonely cave, Or castle, high embattled on the point Of some steep mountain, or in convent walls; For most with pity heard his song, and marked The countenance of the wayfaring boy; Or when the pale monk, with his folded hands Upon his breast, prayed, For the love of God, Pity the poor, give alms; and bade them speed! And now, in distant light, the pinnacles Of a gray fane appeared, whilst on the woods Still evening shed its parting light. Oh, say, Say, villager, what towers are those that rise Eastward beyond the alders? Know ye not, He answered, Waltham Abbey? Harold there Is buried—he who in the fight was slain At Hastings! To the cheek of Adela A deadly paleness came. On—let us on! Faintly she cried, and held her brother's arm, And hid her face a moment with her hand. And now the massy portal's sculptured arch Before them rose. Say, porter, Ailric cried, Poor mariners, wrecked on the northern shores, Ask charity. Does aged Osgood live? Tell him a poor Franciscan, wandering far, And wearied, for the love of God would ask His charity. Osgood came slowly forth; The light that touched the western turret fell On his pale face. The pilgrim-father said: I am your brother Ailric—look on me! And these are Harold's children! Whilst he spoke, Godwin, advancing, with emotion cried, We are his children! I am Godwin, this Is Edmund, and, lo! poor and in disguise, Our sister! We would kneel upon his grave— Our father's! Come yet nearer, Osgood said, Yet nearer! and that instant Adela Looked up, and wiping from her eyes a tear, Have you forgotten Adela? O God! The old man trembling cried, ye are indeed Our benefactor's children! Adela, Edmund, brave Godwin! welcome to these walls— Welcome, my old companion! and he fell Upon the neck of Ailric, and both wept. Then Osgood: Children of that honoured lord Who gave us all, go near and bless his grave. One parting sunbeam yet upon the floor Rested—it passed away, and darker gloom Was gathering in the aisles. Each footstep's sound Was more distinctly heard, for all beside Was silent. Slow along the glimmering fane They passed, like shadows risen from the tombs. The entrance-door was closed, lest aught intrude Upon the sanctity of this sad hour. The inner choir they enter, part in shade And part in light, for now the rising moon Began to glance upon the shrines, and tombs, And pillars. Trembling through the windows high, One beam, a moment, on that cold gray stone Is flung—the word “Infelix” is scarce seen. Behold his gravestone! Osgood said. Each eye Was turned. A while intent they gazed, then knelt Before the altar, on the marble stone! No sound was heard through all the dim expanse Of the vast building, none but of the air That came in dying echoes up the aisle, Like whispers heard at the confessional. Thus Harold's children, hand in hand, knelt down— Upon their father's grave knelt down, and prayed: Have mercy on his soul—have mercy, Lord! They knelt a lengthened space, and bowed their heads, Some natural tears they shed, and crossed their breasts; Then rising slowly up, looked round, and saw A monk approaching near, unmarked before; And in the further distance the tall form As of a female. He who wore the hood And habit of a monk approached and spoke: Brothers! beloved sister! know ye not These features?—and he raised his hood—Behold Me—me, your brother Marcus! whom these weeds, Since last we met, have hidden from the world: Let me kneel with you here! When Adela Beheld him, she exclaimed, Oh! do we meet Here, my lost brother, o'er a father's grave? You live, restored a moment in this world, To us as from the grave! And Godwin took His hand, and said, My brother, tell us all; How have you lived unknown? Oh! tell us all! When in that grave our father, he replied, Was laid, ye fled, and I in this sad land Remained to cope with fortune. To these walls I came, when Ailric, from his vows absolved, With you was wandering. None my lineage knew, Or name, but I some time had won regard From the superior. Osgood knew me not, For with Earl Edwin I had lived from youth. To our superior thus I knelt and prayed: Sir, I beseech you, for the love of God, And of our Lady Mary, and St John, You would receive me here to live and die Among you. What most moved my heart to take The vows was this, that here, from day to day, From year to year, within the walls he raised, I might behold my father's grave. This eve I sat in the confessional, unseen, When you approached. I scarce restrained the tear, From many recollections, when I heard A tale of sorrow and of sin. Come near, Woman of woe!—and a wan woman stood Before them, tall and stately; her dark eyes Shone, as the uncertain lamp cast a brief glare, And showed her neck, and raven hair, and lips Moving. She spoke not, but advanced and knelt— She, too—on Harold's grave; then prayed aloud, O God, be merciful to him—and me! Who art thou? Godwin cried. Ah! know ye not The wretched Editha? No children's love Could equal mine! I trod among the dead— Did I not, fathers?—trod among the dead From corse to corse, or saw men's dying eyes Fixed upon mine, and heard such groans as yet Rive, with remembrance, my torn heart: I found Him who rests here, where then he lay in blood! When he was buried, I beheld the rites At distance, and with broken heart retired To the wild woods; there I have lived unseen From that sad hour. Late when the tempest rocked, At midnight, a proud soldier shelter sought In my lone cell; 'twas when the storm was heard Through the deep forest, and he too had knelt At Harold's grave! Who was it? He! the king! Say, fathers, was it not the hand of God That led his footsteps there!—but has he learned Humility? Oh! ask this bleeding land! Last night a phantom came to me in dreams, And a voice said, Come, visit my cold grave! I came, by some mysterious impulse led; I heard the even song, and when the sound Had ceased, and all departed, save one monk, Who stood and gazed upon this grave alone, I prayed that he would hear me, at this hour, Confess my secret sins, for my full heart Was labouring. It was Harold's son who sat In the confessional, to me unknown; But all is now revealed—and lo! I stand Before you! As she spoke, a thrilling awe Came to each heart: loftier she seemed to stand In the dim moonlight; sorrowful, yet stern, Her aspect; and her breast was seen to beat; Her eyes were fixed, and shone with fearful light. She raised her right hand, and her dark hair fell Upon her neck, whilst all, scarce breathing, heard: My spirit labours! she exclaimed. This night! The tomb! the altar! Ha! the vision strains My senses to oppression! Marked ye not The trodden throne restored—the Saxon line Of England's monarchs bursting through the gloom? Lady, I look on thee! In distant years, Even from the Northern throne which thou shalt share, A warrior-monarch shall arise, whose arm, In concert with this country, now bowed low, Shall tear the eagle from a conqueror's grasp, Far greater than this Norman! Spare, O God! My burning brain! Then, with a shriek, she fell, Insensible, upon the Saxon's grave! They bore her from the fane; and Godwin said, Peace, peace be with her, now and evermore! He, taking Marcus by the hand, Yet here Thou shalt behold, behold from day to day, This honoured grave! But where in the great world Shall be thy place of rest, poor Adela? O God, be ever with her! Marcus cried, With her, and you, my brothers! Here we part, Never to meet again. Whate'er your fate, I shall remember with a brother's love, And pray for you; but all my spirit rests In other worlds—in worlds, oh! not like this! Ye may return to this sad scene when I Am dust and ashes; ye may yet return, And visit this sad spot; perhaps when age Or grief has brought such change of heart as now I feel, then shall you look upon my grave, And shed one tear for him whose latest prayer Will be: Oh, bless you! bless my sister, Lord! Then Adela, with lifted look composed: Father, it is performed,—the duty vowed When we returned to this devoted land, The last sad duty of a daughter's love! And now I go in peace—go to a world Of sorrow, conscious that a father's voice Speaks to my soul, and that thine eye, O God! Whate'er the fortunes of our future days, Is o'er us. Thou, direct our onward road! O'er the last Saxon's grave, old Osgood raised His hands and prayed: Father of heaven and earth, All is beneath Thine eye! 'Tis ours to bend In silence. Children of misfortune, loved, Revered—children of him who raised these roofs, No home is found for you in this sad land; And none, perhaps, may know the spot, or shed A tear upon the earth where ye are laid! So saying, on their heads he placed his hands, And blessed them all; but, after pause, rejoined: 'Tis dangerous lingering here—the fire-eyed lynx Would lap your blood! Westward, beyond the Lea, There is a cell where ye may rest to-night. The portal opened; on the battlements The moonlight shone, silent and beautiful! Before them lay their path through the wide world— The nightingales were singing as they passed; And, looking back upon the glimmering towers, They, led by Ailric, and with thoughts on heaven, Through the lone forest held their pensive way. CONCLUSION. William, on his imperial throne, at York Is seated, clad in steel, all but his face, From casque to spur. His brow yet wears a frown, And his eyes show the unextinguished fire Of steadfast vengeance, as his inmost heart Yet labours, like the ocean after storm. His sword unsheathed appears, which none besides Can wield; his sable beard, full and diffused, Below the casque is spread; the lion ramps Upon his mailed breast, engrailed with gold. Behind him stand his barons, in dark file Ranged, and each feature hid beneath the helms; Spears, with escutcheoned banners on their points, Above their heads are raised. Though all alike Are cased in armour, know ye not that knight Who next, behind the king, seems more intent To listen, and a loftier stature bears? 'Tis bold Montgomerie; and he who kneels Before the seat, his armour all with gules Chequered, and chequered his small banneret, Is Lord Fitzalain. William holds a scroll In his right hand, and to Fitzalain speaks: All these, the forfeited domains and land Of Edwin and of Morcar, traitor-lords, From Ely to the banks of Trent, I give To thee and thine! Fitzalian lowly knelt, And kissed his iron hand; then slowly rose, Whilst all the barons shouted, Live the king! This is thy song, William the Conqueror, The tale of Harold's children, and the grave Of the last Saxon! The huge fortress frowns Still on the Thames, where William's banner waved, Though centuries year after year have passed, As the stream flows for ever at its feet; Harold, thy bones are scattered, and the tomb That held them, where the Lea's lorn wave delayed, Is seen no more; and the high fane, that heard The Eleeson pealing for thy soul, A fragment stands, and none will know the spot Where those whom thou didst love in dust repose, Thy children! But the tale may not be vain, If haply it awake one duteous thought Of filial tenderness. That day of blood Is passed, like a dark spectre: but it speaks Even to the kingdoms of the earth: Behold The hand of God! From that dark day of blood, When Vengeance triumphed, and the curfew knolled, England, thy proud majestic policy Slowly arose! Through centuries of shade The pile august of British liberty Towered, till behold it stand in clearer light Illustrious. At its base, fell Tyranny Gnashes his teeth, and drops the broken sword; Whilst Freedom, Justice, to the cloudless skies Uplift their radiant forms, and Fame aloft Sounds o'er the subject seas, from east to west, From north to south, her trumpet—England, live! And rule, till waves and worlds shall be no more! ST JOHN IN PATMOS. War, and the noise of battle, and the hum Of armies, by their watch-fires, in the night, And charging squadrons, all in harness bright, The sword, the shield, the trumpet, and the drum— Themes such as these, too oft, in lofty song Have been resounded, while the poet strung His high heroic lyre, and louder sung Of chariots flashing through the armed throng:— But other sights and other sounds engage, Fitlier, the thoughts of calm-declining age, More worthy of the Christian and the sage; Who, when deep clouds his country have o'ercast, And sadder comes the moaning of the blast, To God would consecrate a parting lay Of holier homage, ere he pass away.

Cave in Patmos—Apparition—Mysterious Visitant—Day, Night, and Morning. 'Twas in the rugged and forsaken isle Of Patmos, dreariest of the sister isles Which strew the Ægean, where the pirate, wont To rove the seas with scymitar of blood, Now scowled in sullen exile, an old man, Tranquilly listening to the ocean-sounds, And resting on his staff, beside a cave, Gazed on the setting sun, as it went down In glory o'er the distant hills of Greece. Pale precipices frowned above the track Of dark gray sands and stone; nor wood nor stream Cheered the lone valleys, desolate, and sad, And silent; not a goat amid the crags Wandering, and picking here and there a blade Of withered grass, above the sea-marge hung. The robber scowled, and spoke not; his dark eye Still flashed unconquered pride, and sullen hate To man, and, looking on his iron chain, He muttered to himself a deeper curse. The old man had his dwelling in a cave, Half-way upon the desert mountain's side, Now bent with the full weight of eighty years And upwards; and that caverned mountain-crag Five years had been his dwelling: there he sat, Oft holding converse, not with forms of earth, But, as was said, with spirits of the blessed, Beyond this cloudy sphere, or with the dead Of other days. A girdle bound his loins; Figs and Icarian honey were his food; An ill-carved cup by a clear fount was seen; His long locks and his white descending beard Shook when he tottered down into the sun, Supported by a slender cross of pine, His staff; and when the evening star arose O'er Asia, a brief time he stood and gazed, Then sought his melancholy cave and prayed. And who, in this sad place, was this old man? Who, in this island, where the robber scowled, Was this old man, exiled and destitute— Old, but so reverenced, the murderer passed His rocky dwelling, and bade peace to it? 'Twas he who leaned upon our Saviour's breast At the last supper; he to whom the Lord, Looking upon his countenance of youth, His calm, clear forehead, and his clustering hair, Said, What if he shall tarry till I come! Long years—and many sorrows marked these years— Had passed since this was said; and now that face Was furrowed o'er with age; and weariness And exile, in the last lone days of life, Were now his lot; for they whom he had loved— They, the disciples of “Him crucified”— Professing one warm faith, one glorious hope, Were all, in the same faith and the same hope, Laid down in peace, after their pilgrimage, Where the world ceased from troubling. He alone Lingered when all were dead, with fervent prayer Soon in the bosom of his Lord to rest. And now he comes forth from his rocky cave To gaze a while upon the silent sea, In the calm eventide of the Lord's day; To think on Him he loved, and of that voice Once heard on earth: so, pondering, on his staff, The old man watched another sun go down Beyond the Cape of Tenos. The still sea Slept, in the light of eve, beneath his feet, And often, as in very gentleness, It seemed to touch his sandals, and retire. And now the last limb of the sinking orb Is hid, yet far away the cloudy track Reddens with its departing glory. Hark! A voice, and, lo! seven “golden candlesticks,” The “Angels of the Churches” upon earth, “Seven golden candlesticks,” and He, the Lord, Among them, like unto that Son of God Who radiant on the mount of vision stood, Now recognised the same, in the same shape. His hair was white as snow; his eyes were flame; His voice, the sound of waters; in his hand— His raised right hand—seven stars; his countenance As the bright sun, that shineth in his strength; And yet serene as the descending day. It was the Lord: the old man at his feet Fell down as dead; the apparition stood Glorious above his head, and spoke: Fear not; I am the first and last; the last and first: Lo, I am he that liveth, and was dead: And now, behold, I live for evermore— For evermore, and have the keys of hell And death! The glory passed—and all around Is still as death: the old man sinks to earth, Astonied, faint, and pale. When the slow sense Struggled to recollection, he looked around, Yet trembling; but no voice was heard; no form Stood, bending in its glory, o'er him. Then seemed the hills of that forsaken isle More dreary; and the promontories bare Lifted their weather-beaten brows more dark And desolate. Back to his lonely cave The old man passed; and, wrapped in thoughts of heaven, Lifted in prayer his clasped emaciate hands; Then on his bed of rushes in the cave Lay down to rest till dawn. What was his dream? He saw again, as when the rocks were rent, And “darkness at midday was o'er the land,” His Saviour calmly bowing his meek head Upon the cross: he heard that thrilling voice Even from the cross, Woman, behold thy son! Son, look upon thy mother! Then he saw The forms of those whom he had loved on earth, And heard their voices still; and stood entranced, With Peter and with James, upon the mount Of glorious vision; now he saw, in dreams, Again the glistening apparition rise, And stand above him. He has tarried long And lonely in the world: the vision comes To animate his hopes—to say, Live, live With me, for evermore! And, lo, the keys! This opens the bright mansions of the blessed; This closes the eternal gates of hell, Upon the gnashing of the teeth, and groans Unutterable. So the Saviour spoke, As seemed in his sleep. Ah! the stern shade Of murdered Cæsar rises: Art thou dead, King of the world? for this didst thou proclaim Thyself a god—a living god on earth? Let the pit hide thee! But thou art a god! Then bid the fury of these flames assuage Ere they reach thee! Who shrieked? At the sound, The ancient and the solitary man Started from sleep The cold gray dawn appeared, When, standing opposite, with steadfast look, And in the glimmer of the inmost cave, He saw a stranger. Whence and who art thou? With trembling voice he asked—whence? who art thou? Perhaps the spirit of this dismal isle! Or, cast upon these melancholy rocks, A poor and world-forsaken thing, like me! The stranger gazed unmoved, and answered not: His looks were those of pity—of respect— As mingling thoughtful wisdom with the grace Of beauty. In his hand he held a book: He opened it; and never light appeared So fair as that on his majestic brow, For now the sun had risen, and its beams Shot far into the cave. John gazed with awe On that majestic man, he knew not why; And well might he have gazed with reverence, For here, in this rude spot, he only saw Men the most dark and savage of their kind, Murderers, and ruthless criminals in chains. He spoke to them of truth and righteousness— He spoke of an offended God! Some looked To the bright sun, defying; others turned Muttering. He spoke of pity, and they heard, Even as the relentless hurricane Hears the last prayer of the faint mariner, Whom wintry waves had dashed upon the rocks. Yet ever with the gentlest offices, With tears and prayers the holy exile strove To wake their better feelings; for he laid His hands upon the sick, and they looked up With hope and blessed him, and, restored to strength, Forgot the vows they made; him, too, who died Hardened, and, as to human eyes, in sin, He laid in the cold grave, and said a prayer For mercy to the God of all, the Judge, To whom all hearts be open, and from whom No secret thought is hid—and, self-accused, Mortal himself, presumed not to condemn. So passed this ancient holy man his days, Peaceful, amid the banished criminals, Banished and poor himself, but living thus, Among the sternest of their kind, he prayed For their salvation:—so he passed his days Peaceful, but sad; and now, with anxious gaze, He turned his look to the mysterious man, Who, steadfastly beholding him, thus spoke: The voice of prophecy has been fulfilled: Where is the Temple? where Jerusalem? Ah! wretched city! Famine, war, and woe Have done their destined work. The living drops Dead on the carcase he is burying! That famished babe is black! Oh! turn away! All—all is silent now; and thou hast seen This prophecy fulfilled, for not one stone Of beautiful and sacred Solima Is left upon another! He who died, When he beheld the city, o'er it wept, And said, O daughters of Jerusalem! Weep not for me, but for your little ones! The tender words—dost thou remember them? Jerusalem, Jerusalem! how oft Would I have gathered up those little ones, Even as a hen beneath a mother's wing; But ye would not: and now, behold your house Is left unto you desolate! Alas! How desolate! But even in those last days Warning was given, if yet they would repent. A bloody sword, like a red comet, hung Above the Temple, and a strange sad light Sat on the altar; while the inner gate, Untouched, at midnight burst its brazen bars, And stood wide open; armed men did fight Amid the clouds; and, in the dead of night, The pale priest heard a voice, Depart! depart! So the fair city of Jerusalem Perished: but, lo! Christ's holy Church shall rise— Rise from its ashes—yea, is risen now; Its glorious gates shall never be cast down, Till He, the King of glory, shall appear! He founded it upon a rock—a rock, Which time, the rushing earthquake, or the storm, Whilst earth endures, shall never shake! Old man, Beloved of the Lord, wouldst thou know more— What things shall be hereafter? rise and mark! The old man, lifting up his eyelids, slow, Saw a door opened in the heaven, and heard A voice, as of a trumpet: Come and see! Straight he was in the Spirit, and the voice Inquired, What vision comes? The seer replied: There is a throne in heaven, and on the throne One sitteth, and he seems, to look upon, Red as a sardine-stone—a deep, deep red Is round about, yet, as a jasper, bright His face! The sun is of an ashy pale, So red and bright that form! VOICE. Thou seest the throne Of the Eternal Justice. Look again. JOHN. There is a rainbow round about the throne, Tempering the fiery red. VOICE. It is the bow Of mercy, and of pardon, and of peace; Of mercy, as when, stealing from the clouds, It came forth, beautiful and silently, Above the waste of waters, and the flood, Receding—token of the covenant Of grace restored; while the great orb of day Shone westering, and some few small drops of rain Fell transient in the sunshine, where, far off, The wings of the ascending dove were seen, And by the altar, in the rainbow-light— That light upon the altar and his brow— The world's survivor stood. What seest thou more? JOHN. About the throne are four and twenty seats; And four and twenty elders, clothed in white, Each having on his head a crown of gold, Are on those seats. VOICE. Dost thou not hear a voice? JOHN. Yea! voices, such as earth ne'er heard; and, lo! There are seven lamps of fire, before the throne. VOICE. They are the Spirits of the living God. JOHN. Four mighty cherubims, which blaze with eyes, Having six wings, and full of eyes within, Are 'round the throne: I see their radiant forms. VOICE. These rest not night nor day. JOHN. I hear them now, Proclaiming, Holy, holy, holy Lord, Lord God Almighty, Him who was, and is, And is to come! And while these cherubims Give honour, glory, praise, and thanks to Him Who sitteth on the throne,— VOICE. To Him who lives For ever and for ever! JOHN. They fall down, The four and twenty elders, at the feet Of Him who sitteth on the throne, and cast Their crowns before the throne, and cry, O Lord Almighty! thou art worthy to receive Glory and honour, majesty and might! Thou hast created all things; and for thee They are and were created! VOICE. Oh that earth Might answer their glad voices! Oh that earth Might listen and repeat! What more? JOHN. I see, In His right hand who sitteth on the throne, A book; without, within darkly inscribed, Having seven seals. Now, a strong angel cries, With a loud voice, What man is worthy found To loose the seals, and open that dark book! VOICE. Ah! no one, in the heaven or on the earth, May open that same book, or look thereon! Why dost thou weep? JOHN. I weep because no man Is worthy found to open, or to read, Or look upon that book. I weep for this. VOICE. Weep not; but say what follows. JOHN. Lo! a Lamb, As it were slain—it hath seven horns and eyes. He takes the book from the right hand of Him Who sitteth on the throne! VOICE. What follows? mark! JOHN. The elders and the mighty cherubims Fall down before the Lamb, the Lamb of God, With solemn harps, and golden vials full Of odours. VOICE. These are prayers of saints on earth: They sing a new song to the Lamb! JOHN. And shout: Thou only, Lamb of God! art worthy found To take the book, and ope the seals thereof; For thou wert slain, thou hast redeemed us From every tongue and nation upon earth! VOICE. Hearest thou aught beside? JOHN. I hear the voice, Of shining mighty troops, about the throne, Angels, and seraphim, and cherubim, Ten thousand and ten thousand hierarchies, Lift up their voices: Worthy is the Lamb, Slain from the world's foundation, to receive Riches and wisdom. Blessing, glory, power Be unto Him that sitteth on the throne, And to the Lamb, for ever and for ever! The quail goes clamouring by; the old man raises His eyelids, and the vision floats away. PART SECOND. Morning in the Ægean—Contemplative view—Seven Churches of Asia— Superstitions—Crete, Egypt—Spread of Gospel Light through the Pagan World. How beautiful is morning on the hills Of Asia, stretching far, and faint descried! While, nearer, all the sunny Sporades, That break the blue Ægean, shine in light, On this autumnal dawn! How musical The fresh airs, and the ocean's solemn sound Come to the mountain grot! Let us go forth, Said then the unknown and mysterious man. JOHN. First on that mossy stone, beneath the arch, Kneel we, and offer up our orisons To Him who bade the sun go forth: O God, Thou didst create this living world! Thy voice, When darkness sat upon the lonely deep, Spoke—Be there light, and there was light! Thy hand Spread out the heavens, and fashioned from the dust Man, the high habitant of earth, now fallen, And to return to dust again: but thanks Be unto thee, O Christ! who, when the trump Shall sound, and all this mortal pomp is passed, Shalt call the dead up, incorruptible! And glory be to Thee, O Spirit pure! Who hast infused into our hearts of flesh The love of God, through faith in Jesus Christ! Oh! in the hour of death, and in the day Of judgment, Lord, to us be merciful! So prayed they, suppliant, when morning shone Upon the seas; so they together prayed, Giving God thanks that one more day of light Was granted to the feeble and the old, Ere long to rest in peace. Upon their heads, As slow they rose, a halo seemed to rest, Touching the forehead of the aged man: The features of the younger, as he stood, Were mild, but awful; thoughtful, yet not sad; Whilst, from the caverned rock, into the sun, The lonely and the last Apostle came. As both together stood and gazed a while Upon the deep blue sea, the younger said: Listen, old man: I was at Antioch, When mild Evodias filled St Peter's chair; And fair that place, as well beseems the spot Where first the Christian name was heard. The Vale Of Tempe, sung through Greece, is not so fair As that green valley, where Orontes winds, Beneath the grove of Daphne, to the sea; Scarce Eden fairer, where the first-formed man Stood up majestic, in the world's new day. I heard Evodias, and from youth I loved To wander 'mid the scenes of old renown, Hallowed by prophets, and by holy men, Who long from earth had passed. How beautiful Upon those hills and mountains were the feet Of them who brought glad tidings of the light, Now risen on the darkened world! I sat Upon a stone of fallen Jerusalem, Sat down and wept, when I remembered thee, O Sion! and thy Temple, and thy sons Scattered in the wide world—scattered or dead! Like him, the mighty prophet, who of yore Watched the dark gathering of the clouds and rain, I stood upon Mount Carmel, and beheld The great sea westward. Hark! Euroclydon Is up; the tempest rushes from the east; Fire and the whirlwind follow; but, O God! Thou art not in the whirlwind nor the fire. And, after, came a still small voice, which said, Go, visit John, sad and in solitude. We sailed from Joppa, in a Tyrian ship, To Rhodes: a skiff was waiting near the shore, On which the shadowy moonlight seemed to rest; Then a pale mariner, who never spoke, Conveyed me hither, swift as silently— Swift, though the passing keel no murmur made, As the dim sail no shadow cast. I looked, When I had reached the shore, and it was gone! I saw thy mountain-cave: I stood and gazed A while on thy gray hairs as thou didst sleep, And the same voice which came, after the wind, Said audibly, Reveal to him the things That shall hereafter be, as I unfold. I watched when the great vision came to thee, Hearing the voice and answer: it was sent To animate thy hope! Art thou refreshed, As now these airs of morn blow soothingly, And breathe a sad repose? John placed his hand, Pale and emaciate, on his breast, and said: Thy words might raise from earth the heaviest heart. Then both in silence gazed on the blue sea, And heard it murmuring. John his full look Towards his face who spoke now turned intent, To mark his features. Dignity serene Was on that face; and as the freshening airs Stirred the dark locks that clustered round his brow, A faint rose mantled on his cheek; his cloak, Gathered upon his breast, descending touched His sandals; whilst, with more majestic mien, Pointing to Asia's hills, he spoke again: Old man, lift up thine eyes—turn to the east: How fair, with tower and turret, by the stream Of clear Cayister, shines that Ephesus, The “angel” of whose “golden candlestick” Here droops in banishment! Hail, Smyrna, hail! Beneath thy towers, and piers, and bastions, Far-seen through intermingled cypresses, Ships from all nations, with their ensigns, float Silent; but, lo! a purer light from heaven Is on thy walls, while from the citadel Streams the triumphant banner of the Cross. And beautiful thy sisters of the faith, First, in the east, when the wide world was dark, Laodicea, Philadelphia, And Pergamos, and Thyatira, shine, While Sardis, at the foot of Tmolus high, Seems from the wildering plains below, to gleam Like a still star that guides the sailor's way O'er Adria! But, alas! here Antichrist Shall rise with power, permitted from on high! Mourn, Ephesus, thy glory and thy light Extinguished! Sardis, Thyatira, mourn: Yet the blessed kingdom of the Lamb again Shall be restored, and all the earth bow down To the “unarmed Conqueror of the world.” Turn to the south, there are the pines of Crete, And, hark! the frantic Coribantes shout To Cybele, the mother of the gods, Drawn, by gaunt lions, in her car: they move In stern subjection, and with foot-fall slow, And shaggy necks hung down, though their red eyes Flash fire beneath; silent and slow they pace. 'Mid cymbals, shouts, and songs, and clashing swords, Pipes, and the dissonance of brazen drums, She bears aloft her calm brow, turreted. JOHN. Oh, pomp of proud and dire idolatry! Crete, other sounds thy sister-island heard, Far other sounds, when, on his seat of power, Amid the altars of the Queen of Love, The Christian faith there touched a heathen's heart. Paul was in Cyprus: the Proconsul prayed To hear of faith from the Apostle's lips, But Elymas withstood him, Elymas The sorcerer. He beckoned up his legions dire Of fierce and frowning shadows. Paul, unmoved, Smote him, amid his gaunt and grisly troop,— Smote him with instant blindness, and he stood Dark in the midday sun. STRANGER. Was not the hand Of God so visible, that ships of Tyre Might bear the tidings from the east to west From Tyre to Thule? South from Crete, behold The land of ancient Egypt, scarce discerned Above the sea-line, the mysterious land Of Isis, and Anubis; of the Sphynx, Of Memnon, resonant at early dawn, When the red sun rose o'er the desert sands; Of those vast monuments—their tale unknown— Which, towering, pale and solemn, o'er the waste, Stand mocking the uplifted mace of Time, Who, as he smites in vain, mutters, and hies To other spoil! Yet there the timbrelled hymn Rings to Osiris; there, great Isis reigns, Veiled, and no mortal hath removed her veil; There, Thoth, first teacher of the mysteries Of sacred wisdom, hid in signs obscure, Is still invoked to lead the ghosts, that pass Through the dim portal, to hell's silent king. JOHN. Hast thou forgotten, that in this dark land, The passover—meet emblem of the Lamb Of God—was first ordained? That here his power In wonder and in judgment was displayed? “Fire ran along upon the ground,” with hail Mingled; and darkness, such as might be felt— Darkness, not earthly, was on all the land. Arrested and suspended at God's word, On either side the billows of the deep Hung over those who passed beneath their shade, While Pharaoh's charioteers and horsemen sank In the Red Sea: “not one of them is left.” STRANGER. And Miriam took a timbrel in her hand, And all the women went out after her, With timbrels, and with dances, and they sang: And Miriam answered them, Sing to the Lord, For he hath triumphed—triumphed gloriously! The rider and his horse hath he cast down Into the sea—the rider and his horse! And the dark sea was silent over them. But Israel's children safely held their way, And the Lord went before them in a cloud Like to a pillar, and a fire by night, Till Moses, bearing with him Joseph's bones, Beheld, from Pisgah's top, far off, in clouds, The land of promise—saw that blessed land, And died in peace. JOHN. Oh! may the pilgrimage Of the tired Christian, in the wilderness Of life, so lead him to his home of rest! STRANGER. Look northward—for the sheet let down from heaven Had “its four corners knit:” and are not these The north, the south, the east, the west—in bonds Of brotherhood, and faith, and charity? Mountains and forests by the Caspian, plains Of Scythia, and ye dwellers on the shores Of the Black Sea, where the vast Ister hurls, Sounding, its mass into the inner deep; Shout, for the banners of the cross of Christ Far as your dark recesses have been borne, By Andrew and by Thomas, messengers Of the slain Lamb—even to the utmost bounds Of wild and wintry Caucasus! Aloft, In silence, high above the rack of earth, That solitary mountain stands, nor hears The thunder bursting at its base. JOHN. So stands The Christian, calm amid the storms of life, Heaven's sunshine on his head, and all the cares And sorrows of the world beneath his feet! STRANGER. Yea! and the Cross shall further yet be borne, To realms of pagan darkness and deep night! The cymbals to the gods of fire and blood Shall clash no more; the idol-shapes are fled; Grim Moloch's furnace sinks in smoke, to sounds Strange and unutterable; but that shriek! It came from Tauris, from the altars red Of Scythian Diana terrible! She, too, has left that altar and its blood, As when her image young Orestes bore (So fable masters of the pagan harp)— Bore in his ship o'er the black waves to Greece. Greece! who can think of thee, thou land of song, Of science, and of glory, and not feel How in this world illustrious thou hast been, If triumphs such as thine may be pronounced Illustrious, worthy thine own Plato's fame! Here the proud Stoic spoke of constancy, Of magnanimity, which raised the soul Above all mortal change; of Jove's high will; Of fate;—and here the master, from the schools Of human wisdom, to his votaries, Spoke of the life of man but as the flower Blooming to fade and die; alas! to die, And never bloom again! Vain argument! 'Twas on that hill, named of the fabled lord Of battle and of blood, amid the shrines And altars of the Grecian deities, Before the temple of the Parthenon, That shone, on this illustrious hill, aloft, And as supreme o'er all the lesser fanes, Fronting the proud proficients in the code Of such vain wisdom, vain philosophy, Fearless amid this scene of earthly pomp, Eloquent, ardent, and inspired by Heaven, The loved Apostle stood. With look upraised, And hands uplifted, he spoke fervently; Spoke of that God, whose altar he had marked, “The unknown God,” who dwelleth not on earth, In temples made with hands, but in the heavens, 'Mid inaccessible and glorious light. In Him we live and move; He giveth life, And breath, and all things. Him alone behoves To worship and adore with prayer and praise. That God is now revealed, who, by his Son, Shall judge the world in righteousness, when earth And heaven shall pass away; when the last trump Shall sound above the graves of all who sleep; When all who sleep, and all who are alive, Shall be caught up together in the clouds, To stand before the judgment-seat of Him Whom God appointed Judge; who shall descend From heaven, with a shout, and with the voice Of the Archangel, and the trump of God, While sun, and moon, and stars, are blotted out, And perish as a scroll! As Paul thus spoke— Spoke of the resurrection of the dead— 'Mid the proud fanes of pagan deities, At Athens, the stern Stoic mocked; the flowers Seemed withering on the brow of that fair youth, Whom Epicurus taught that life was brief, Brief as those flowers which in the garden bloom Of that philosopher of earthly bliss. And what the moral? Let us eat and drink, For we to-morrow die. Oh! heartless creed! Far other lessons Christ's Apostle taught, Of faith, of hope, of judgment, in a world To come, of light and life beyond the grave. So Athens, Corinth, Macedonia, heard The tidings of salvation. Hark! the sound Is gone forth to all lands: the glorious light Extends—the light of faith, and hope, and joy— The light from Heaven; whilst he, so falsely called The God of Day, shorn of his golden hair, And rays of morn, shall leave his Delphian shrine, Discomfited, and hide his head in night. The dayspring of Heaven's purer light hath reached Imperial Rome: the tyrant on his throne Starts; at his voice the famished lion springs And crashes the pale martyr at his feet; While the vast amphitheatre is hushed, And not a sound heard through the multitude, But that dire crash, and the breath inly drawn, The moment it is heard, from the still throng Shuddering; the blood streams from the lion's beard, Whilst that vast, breathless amphitheatre Bursts into instant thunders to the skies. But not the lion, with blood-matted mane, Nor the fierce fires about the martyr's stake, With rolling smoke, that the winds warp away In surges, when the miserable man Blackened and half-consumed appears; not these, Nor famine, nor the sword, nor death, nor hell, Shall move the Christian's heart or hope, or fray Him, steadfast and victorious, though he die. Farther and farther yet the light is spread And thou hast lived to see this gospel-dawn Kindling from Asia, like a beacon-flame Through darkness—oh! more cheering than the morn, With all its lovely hues, on sea or shore, As now it shines around us! John replied: Teacher of wisdom, or from heaven or earth, We know that Paul, our brother in the faith, Proclaimed the tidings of “Him crucified” From Rome to Spain; but Paul is in his grave: Soon must I follow him, and be at rest: Who then shall bear these tiding of great joy, To all the people of all lands? STRANGER. That book Which the Lamb opened, as a “flying roll” Angels of light shall bear with wings unseen, From shore to shore; and thus, though Paul be dead, He still shall speak, and millions yet unborn Shall bless the boon. Thou shalt reveal the things That thou hast seen; but that same book, which none In heaven or earth could open, but the Lamb, None but the Lamb shall close. Awake, awake, Ye who now slumber in the shades of death! Yes! every nation shall confess the Lord; Till all shall be fulfilled, and there shall be, Through the wide world, “one Shepherd and one fold.” For deem not this small frith, called “the Great Sea,” That girds yon promontories, girds the world: Without is the great ocean, the main sea, Rocking in tempest and in solitude; Ten thousand isles are scattered o'er the waste Of those dark waters, and each isle and land, All earth, shall be one altar; and from earth To heaven one flame of incense, and one voice Of prayer and praise and harmony shall rise! So these two held communion on the shore Of melancholy Patmos, when a sound As of a griding chain was heard, and, lo! A criminal is kneeling at the feet Of the old man: God has been kind to me, He cried, and hid his forehead with his hands. Oh! listen to my tale, and pray for me. 'Twas when the Roman sentinel, who paced The platform of the dungeon where we slept, Had called the midnight watch, and overhead Bright Aldebaran held his course in heaven, Westering o'er yonder Cape, I waked, and mused On my eventful life. Then to my heart Came words which I had heard from thee: I wept Even as an infant, and I smote my breast. The brave companion of my fortunes died— Died yesterday, stern and impenitent As he lived, pitiless; and, left alone, I cried for mercy, mercy of that God Whom thou didst call thy Father; and I prayed To Christ, and cried, Me—me—oh! pardon me! I dare not lift my eyes. Thou, father, hear. I am a free-born citizen of Rome, My name, Pedanius, the Decurion. When Titus led his legions to the East, Against the city of Jerusalem, To raze it from the earth; at the last day, When the third wall shook to the battering-rams, Amid the shrieks of horror and despair, Flung from the tottering battlements, a babe Fell at my horse's feet. Famished and black, With livid lips and ghastly, on the ground It lay; when, frantic from the crowd within, A wretched and bereaved woman rushed, And held my bridle, fearless of the swords That flashed above her head. I heard her cries— Protect me!—he is dead!—my child, my child! Brave soldier, for the love of God! I looked A moment, there was famine in her face, Wasted, yet beautiful. Pitying, I spoke: Follow; and through the clouds of smoke we passed To the green olive trees, and then she sank Upon the ground, and, pale and still as death, Lay long—the winds just stirring her dark hair: I brought her water from the spring that wells, Soft murmuring, from the brook of Siloa: She drank, and feebly opened her dark eyes, Which seemed more large, for all her flesh was shrunk; Then she looked up, and faintly spoke again; My mother—and my husband—and my child— Are—and she sobbed aloud. By Him, I cried, Who rules among the gods, I will protect Thy life with mine! Her tears fell fast and warm Upon the bloody hand which held the sword; The other checked my fierce and foaming horse. Hark! hark! a turret falls! Hark! hark! again— They shout, ten thousand voices rend the skies, The Temple, the proud Temple to the ground! The Temple, the proud temple to the dust! Her infant she had taken from the ground, To lay it in her bosom, while the tears Fell on its folded hands; but when she saw Still its wan livid lips, and the same glare Of its dead eyes, she turned away her face, Half looking down, half raised to heaven, and shed Her tears no more: one hand as thus she sat, With fingers spread, held fast her infant's arm, O'er its right shoulder, while its arid lips She drew, in vain, towards her open breast, Still fearing to look down: her other hand, Instinctively, she laid on its cold feet, As if to cherish them: the gouts of blood Fell heavy from its matted hair, and stained Her bosom; but she had composed its hands, Which now, though cold and dead, each other clasped, Beneath her neck, as living. So she sat, Nor sighed, nor moved her face, nor shed a tear. I gently took the infant from her arms, And buried it beside the sacred brook, And then, with muttered prayer, she turned and wept— Wept, as bereaved of all she loved on earth! Fly! and I placed her on the horse with me— Leaving behind the sounds and sights of death— The shrieks of massacre, the crash of towers Falling, the heavy sound of battering-rams: We passed the victims, blackening in the sun, And some, yet breathing, on the crucifix. On, through the valley of Jehoshaphat, I spurred my horse; we passed the sepulchre Of Lazarus, restored from the dark grave, So those who own the faith of Christ affirm, With eye-balls ghastly glaring in the light, At the loud voice of Him who cried, Come forth! We held our eastern way from Bethany, Till now we reached the “Plain of Blood.” I paused A moment, ere we entered that sad plain. Ah! there are tents upon the southern edge Of the horizon! Fly! it is the camp Of Arabs: see! with long and couched spears, A troop is flying o'er the sands! We hear Their cries—this way they rush—this way— Fly! fly! and instant, as an arrow speeds, (My pale companion breathless, and scarce held) We bounded o'er the desert, till the track Was lost. The voices died away: she sank Faint in my arms, and with her head declined Upon my breastplate. We will rest a while; For she was now so feeble, it behoved Thus oft to rest, if haply she might feel Some cool reviving airs breathe on her face, Gently; a few dry dates were all our food. We gazed in silence on the sun, that, red, Was sinking now beyond the lonely sands, And hurriedly again renewed our flight. The track is lost! Fear not—those are the bones, Not of a murdered traveller. Look out! Is that a cloud? or seest thou not the smoke Of some lone cottage on the hills? List! list! Is it the tinkle of some rivulet, Wandering in solitude? On, on, my steed! We reached the hills, and, looking back, beheld The western cope of heaven, as night came down, All fiery red. It was the light, far off, Of the proud Temple flaming! Through the night We held our toiling way, when, at gray dawn, We saw, beneath us, palms, and city walls, And Jordan, slowly flowing to the south. Yes! these are palms and walls of Jericho; But all was silent and forsaken. War Had blown his trump; and Pity, at the blast, Had knelt in tears, and hid her face to hear That deep, dire groan; but it is heard no more, For Silence, Solitude, and Ruin sit, Mocking each other, at the city gates. Here were no murmurs of tumultuous life. We joined a mourning train, that held their way, Women, and children, and white-headed men, Forlorn, by Jordan's banks, to Galilee, Seeking the city of Tiberias. With many tears, my poor companion told Her tale: a daughter of Jerusalem Implored their pity; and the daggers, raised To pierce a Roman soldier to the heart, Were in the act arrested, for her sake— Trifosa, of the tribe of Benjamin, Who owed her life and safety to his sword. We reached the city: here she had a friend, Widowed like her, who wept to hear her tale. Here, wedded, and by Israel's laws made one, I lived—a fisher toiling with his net To gain our daily bread; but soon my heart Beat for a wider scene—for enterprise, The soul of a young soldier; and with thoughts Stirring and restless, after twelve long months, We came, by Tabor, to the western sea. I had a robber's cavern at the foot Of Carmel, and oft skirred the neighbouring plains On my fleet battle-horse, with spurs of blood. Here I was joined by soldiers, desperate And outcast as myself; we were a band Of secret and of fearful brotherhood That tenanted these caverns. But my wife, When we were absent, and the cave was still, Wept, for the love of those who were no more; Trembled, and wept for me. When I returned, Weary, at night, she sat and sang to me; And sometimes, when she was alone whole days, She wandered o'er the mountains, gathering flowers, Hyacinths, lilies, and anemones; And when my hands were bloody, gave me them, With trembling hand, and sadness in her look. Why should I think, or sigh, or feel remorse! Was I not leader of the bravest band That ever shook their flashing scymitars Against the morning sun! But, oh! that look! How has it thrilled, even to my inmost heart: One child, the pledge of warm affection, died, And now she roved in morning dew no more; And oft, when I returned with gore-stained brow, I saw a strange, sad wandering in her eyes. Alas! her gentle mind was gone! She sang— She gazed upon my face—she smiled—she died— And her last words were, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! I buried her in peace, Without a name, among the mountain flowers. And now my heart was hardened as a rock Against the world. I heard no soothing voice; I never looked upon a human face With tenderness again; a darker shade Of passions gathered on my lonely heart, Till love, and charity, and pity died. I may not say what I have seen and done: Here I have lived a fettered slave seven years; Here thy mild voice has called back to my heart Sad recollections. Father,—and he knelt And kissed his withered hand, and cried again, Oh! father, pray for me! The stranger stood Unmoved, but tears were on the old man's cheek, PART THIRD. The sounds of an approaching storm—Vision, etc. The east is overcast; the nearer isles Are hidden by a sudden spleen; the clouds Upon Elijah's promontory now Are mustering gloomily; there is a sound Of rain, and as, with interrupted gusts, The winds are rising, a long murmur comes, More hollow, from the seas; at times a wail, At distance, seems to mingle with the wind, Audibly; even the sea-birds on the cliffs Cower, while the sounds as of a trump are heard, Prophetical and sad. Let us retire, For Sagittarius rules the wayward year. Pensive, they both retired into the cave. The eyes of John were heavy, and ere long He sank into deep slumber, like a child, Hushed by the ocean sounds; and now arose Visions more dark and terrible. He saw The Lamb of God open the book. Hark! hark! The thunder and the tempest roll! John saw Four cherubims, and they said, Come and see! He looked, and, behold! on a white horse Sat one who had a bow, and he there was crowned; And with his bow, and crowned, he went forth, “Conquering and to conquer.” Hark! a moan Comes up from all the earth! The second seal Is opened, and the second cherubim Cries, Come and see! Behold another horse, And it is red; and he who sits thereon Is like a warrior, waving in his hand The sword of slaughter; so he goeth forth To kill and to destroy, and “to take peace From all the earth.” Listen! for the third seal Is opening now, and the third cherubim Cries, Come and see! Then said a voice to John, What dost thou see? JOHN. Lo! a black horse appears— Its rider has a balance in his hand. Ride on—ride on! Justice and Equity Visit the earth, with Plenty. The fourth seal Is opened now, and the fourth cherubim Cries, Come and see! VOICE. What seest thou? JOHN. A pale horse— VOICE. And rider? JOHN. Yes—a dire anatomy. As he rides on, nations with terror shriek— Death! and the gulf of hell shoots out its flame After the footfall of that ghastly horse. The rider shouts, and haggard Famine crawls, With wan and wasted visage, from her cave; And Pestilence, speeding unseen in air, Breathes, and ten thousand perish, and wild beasts Howl in the city of the dead, and feed Upon the black and countless carcases. Low thunders rolled, and sounds of woe were heard, When the fifth seal was opened, and John saw A burning altar, and beneath it, souls Of those who had been slain—the witnesses, Confessing Christ in torments, and they cried, How long, O Lord, holy, and just, and true, Dost thou not judge—judge and avenge our cause! And robes of white were given to each of them, And a voice said, Oh! rest ye yet a while, Rest ye till persecution's cup be drained; The judgment leave to Him who sits in heaven. The thunders louder rolled, as the sixth seal Was opened. Ah! the sun is black above As sackcloth, and the round moon red as blood; Earth rocks from east to west; the stars are fallen, And falling, as the fig-tree casts its figs, When shaken by the mighty hurricane. Heaven is departing, like a scroll; the kings, And the chief captains, and the mighty men, Bondmen and free, have hid them in the caves, And mountains, and dark places of the earth, And to the mountains and the rocks they cry, Fall on us! hide us—hide us from the face Of the incensed Lamb, for his great day Of wrath is come, and who on earth may stand! And after this, John saw four angels stand On the four corners of the earth; they held The rushing winds, that not a wind should blow Tumultuous on the earth, or on the sea, Whilst they stood silent; then with radiant wings, Bright as the sun ascending from the east, Another glorious angel came, who bore Thy seal, O living God; and a loud voice To the four angels cried, Hurt not the earth Or seas, till on their foreheads we have sealed The servants of our God. And they were sealed Of all the tribes of Israel. After this, A multitude which no man on the earth Could number, of all nations and all tongues, Clothed in white robes, and bearing in their hands Palms, as triumphant, stood before the throne Of glory, and before the Lamb of God, And cried aloud, Salvation to our God, Which sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb. And all the angels stood about the throne, The elders, and the mighty cherubims, And on their faces fell, before the throne, And worshipped God, and cried aloud, Amen: Blessing and glory, wisdom, honour, power, Be to our God, for ever and for ever! Then seemed that one among the elders spake To John, and said, What are these multitudes Who bear triumphant palms, all clothed in white? John answered, Sir, thou knowest. He replied, These are victorious saints, who have come out From the great tribulation, and have washed Their bloody garments, and have made them white— White through His blood who died upon the cross; Therefore they stand before the throne of God, And in his temple serve him day and night, And He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell Among them. They shall hunger now no more, Nor thirst; the sun shall cheer them, but not burn; The Lamb shall feed them, and shall lead them forth To pleasant pastures, and to fountains bright, And from their eyelids wipe away all tears For ever. There was silence in the heavens, When the seventh seal was opened, and John saw Seven angels standing by the throne of God, Having seven trumpets; and an angel came, Who, hovering, with a golden censer, stood Before an altar, and the smoke went up, Of incense, from the altar. These are prayers Of all the saints on earth—prayers which ascend, Like incense, from the censer in the hand Of that bright angel, to the throne of God. Ah! he has cast his censer to the earth; And suddenly the earthquake and the storm Awoke, and through the darkness, rolled and flashed Deep thunders and the lightning; and, behold! The seven angels lift their trumpets high, Lift, and prepare to sound. And now the first Sounds—and there follows instant hail, and fire Mingled with blood, which on the earth was cast; So that the trees stood bare and desolate, And the green grass was withered and burnt up. The second angel sounded, and, behold! A burning mountain cast into the sea. The third part of all creatures in the sea Died, a third part of all the ships that sailed Upon the sea was smitten and destroyed. And the third angel sounded; and there fell A star from heaven. It fell on the third part Of rivers, and the fountains of the deep; And swollen and livid carcases were left, Weltering, beside the dark, blood-heaving sea. And the fourth angel sounded; and the sun For the third part was smitten, and the moon For the third part was darkened; and John saw And heard an angel flying in mid heaven, And crying with a mighty voice, Woe, woe, Woe to the earth, by reason of the voice Of the three trumpets that are yet to sound! And the fifth trumpet sounded; and John saw A star fall from the heavens to the earth; And to the angel of the star was given The key that shuts the nethermost abyss Upon the groans of those that groan therein. The pit is opened, and the volumed smoke, Shooting red flames, as from a furnace, rolls, And out of it there issued crawling things, Like scorpions; but they had no power to hurt The green grass of the earth, but those alone Who on their foreheads had no seal of heaven: These shall seek death, but find him not, for death Shall fly from them, when they most pray to die. Like horses trained for battle, a dire troop Comes sounding; on their heads are crowns, like gold; Faces are theirs, like men; and they have hair As women, and teeth white and terrible As lions; and their iron breastplates shake, With hurtling noise; the sounding of their wings Is as the chariots and the steeds of war, Rushing to the thick war. Who is their king? Apollyon, angel of the deep abyss. One woe is past, yet two more woes remain; For the sixth angel sounded, and John heard A voice like thunders: The four angels loose, In the great river of Euphrates bound. And the four giant angels are unbound, And they go forth to slaughter. And John saw The horses in the vision, and he saw Those who sat on them, with breastplates of fire, Of jacinth, and of sulphur; and the heads Of the gaunt horses were as lions' heads, And from their mouths issued red fire and smoke. But men repented not, nor turned away From their dark idols, or their sorceries, From worshipping their gods of gold, or stone, Or brass, or silver! Hush! the sound of wings! Another mighty angel comes from heaven, And lights on earth, clothed in a radiant cloud. There is a rainbow on his head; his face Is as the orient sun; his feet appear Pillars of fire; in his right hand a book. He sets his right foot on the seas, his left Upon the earth, and cries, with a loud voice, Till the world shrinks: and when he thus has cried, Seven thunders answer, uttering to heaven Their voices. Then the angel said to John, Art thou about to write? Seal up the things Which the seven thunders uttered: write them not. The angel which John saw stand on the seas, And on the earth, raised his right hand to heaven, And swore by Him which liveth, who shall live For ever and for ever—swore by Him Who made the heaven, the earth, and all therein, That time shall be no more: the mystery Of God shall be concluded in the days Of this last angel's voice. That awful voice John heard entranced; and the voice said to him, Take from the angel's hand,—the hand of him Who standeth on the seas and on the earth,— That book thou markest open in his hand. That book, the rapt Apostle cried, that book! The angel mildly answered, Let thy heart Feed on it; sweet and bitter it shall be, And thou shalt prophesy of things to come, Of dark things yet to be upon the earth. The seventh angel lifted high his trump, And sounded; when from heaven a voice was heard— The kingdoms of this world they are become The kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ: For ever and for ever, he shall reign, For ever and for ever. Now the ark Of God appeared; and round about the ark There was a rainbow stealing through the rain, The ark of the new covenant: and, lo! A shining company stood with the Lamb Upon Mount Zion, and a song was heard Of harpers, harping a new song—the song Of life and immortality. And John Then heard a voice—a voice from heaven, which said, Write, write, From henceforth blessed are the dead Which in the Lord shall die, for they shall rest From all their labours! Blessed are the dead! The shadows are departed; horse and trump Are seen and heard no more; the trumpet's clang Dies far away: the Apostle turned and prayed, With eyes upraised; and now, for pealing trumps, Heard in the wind the lessening sound of harps, Still lessening, and still lessening, till the cave Was silent; and the stirring winds without Alone were heard, like sweet, sad melodies, Remembered in old times; whilst he who stood Beside him watched; and after, as the day Slowly declined, they two conversing sat, Conversing of God's judgment—of the voice Which said to man the sinner, Dust thou art, And unto dust thou shalt return—of death, And immortality through Christ restored; So they deceived the time, till John, oppressed With sights and sounds so terrible, lay down, And sank to sleep, not to awake till dawn. PART FOURTH. Morning—Roman Commander—Vision—Babylon—New Jerusalem—Evening—Night Scene—Stars—Temptation—Dream. John woke from slumber, when the early trump Rang from the Roman camp below, at break Of the gray dawn; and when the sun arose, After his orisons to Heaven, he sat On the rude stone before his cave, and marked His staff and form shadowed against the rock, Watching the fitful gleams that, here and there, Chequered the pale Ægean, far away; While he, who never left his side, appeared Now more majestic, as the beams of day Shone on his waving tresses, when he raised His look to heaven, and stood sublime in light. But see, with vitis of command, and plume And crest, in momentary sunshine bright, The præfect of the Roman guard approach, Hail, father, hail! he cried. And hail to thee, The old man answered, mildly. Art thou come With tidings from the Mistress of the World? ROMAN COMMANDER. The world's great sun is set—Cæsar is dead! JOHN. Cæsar! Ah! in my dream did I not see His shadow stern and sad; the purple robe Dropping with blood! ROMAN COMMANDER. Why, was he not a god?— So he proclaimed himself—a god on earth! Giving command that altars to his name Should blaze, as to great Jupiter! Old man, Art thou not prisoner for gainsaying this? But, father, if a soldier might pronounce, With all respect to thy gray hairs, I deem The sole, imperial master of the world Might worthier claim that title, than a man Mocked, scourged—ay, scourged!—and crucified with thieves! Rose and ascended into heaven! replied The meek old man—a hectic on his cheek— Rose, and ascended into heaven, to sit At the right hand of God, from thence to come, Judge of the quick and dead! Proud soldier, hear— Hear how a prisoner for Jesus Christ Can answer thee! When King Agrippa sat Upon his throne, in oriental state, Surrounded by the Roman soldiery, With axe and fasces of imperial sway, Fair Berenice seated on his right, And on his left Festus the governor, Paul, a poor prisoner of Jesus Christ, Before him stood, in chains; and as he spoke Of “resurrection,” and the world to come, He cried, King of the Jews, dost thou believe The prophets? Yes! I know thou dost believe. The king, with faltering voice, tremblingly cried, Paul, Paul, thou dost persuade even me, almost— To be a Christian! Paul, with lifted hand And steadfast look, thus answered him, Almost! Oh! would that the whole world were not “almost,” But “altogether” such as I am now, Except these bonds. Soldier, I say the same. But hie thee to thy eagle; I am here, A poor old man, like Paul, a prisoner, And thou, an officer of mighty Rome; Yet would I pray to God, that thou may'st be, Oh! not “almost,” but “altogether,” such As I am now, except these few gray hairs, Old age, and many sorrows; yet even here My soul hath been sustained by Him who said, Lo! I am with you alway, and I know He still is with me. I have heard his voice, And seen his look of glory and of love Turned on me, in this solitude; and he— He who did shudder with me at the voice Of thy bold blasphemy, here lately came With words of comfort, and these aged eyes Have seen the things that must hereafter be; Yet know, stern soldier, if my days were passed Lonely as hopeless, I would not exchange These few gray hairs for thy green laurel crown— This solitude, for living Cæsar's throne, Or Cæsar's subject world! The soldier turned Disdainful, and his crest shook in the wind; Then, lifting high his ensign of command, He bade the trumpet sound the second watch. John knelt, and prayed, Thy kingdom come, O Lord! Then he who stood beside him, spoke unmoved: Rome—Rome shall be no more! At dead of night, Hark! the barbarian trump; Jerusalem Shall be avenged; and those of distant days, Pondering the fate of empires, there shall come To muse upon the fragments of her might, Her ancient glory passed as morning clouds, And tremble for the judgments of the Lord In all the world! Now to the cave retire, For other visions of the things to come, And other fearful shadows, must thou see. John sat, and held his hands upon his brow: The earth seems to retire, and all the sounds Of tumult and of woe at once to cease. Then John was in the Spirit, and he saw Seven angels, and, beneath, a sea of glass Mingled with fire; and on the sea of glass Those who had gained, on earth, the victory Over the beast, all standing on the sea Of glass, and in their hands the harps of God, And thus they sung, Oh! great and marvellous Art thou, Almighty God, and just and true Are all thy ways, thou King of saints! Amen. Now from the temple a loud voice was heard, Which said to the seven angels, Go your ways, Pour out the vials of the wrath of God Upon the earth. Then on the men which bore The mark upon their foreheads of the beast, Or fell down to his image, noisome sores And plague-spots fell. The second angel poured His vial on the sea, and it became The blood of a dead man; and every thing Which had the breath of life died in the sea. And the third angel poured his vial out Upon the rivers, and fresh fountains clear, And they became red blood. And then John heard, In trance, the angels of the waters say, Righteous art thou, O Lord! and righteously, O thou which art, and was, and which shall be, Thus hast thou judged, for they have shed the blood Of prophets and of saints! A voice replied, From out the altar, Even so, O Lord! Almighty God, thy judgments are most true! And the fourth angel poured his vial out Upon the sun, and power was given to him To scorch men with the fire, and they blasphemed The name of God, and still repented not, Looking with gnashing teeth upon the sun. And the fifth angel poured his vial out Upon the kingdom of the beast, and, lo! The kingdom of the beast at once was dark: But men repented not—even while they gnawed Their tongues for pain, blaspheming God in heaven. And the sixth angel poured his vial out Where the great river of Euphrates rolls, And it was quick dried up, and so became A highway for the armies of the east, And for the kings of earth, and the whole world, Gathering to battle, on the dreadful day Of the incensed Lord, into a place Called “Armageddon,” in the Hebrew tongue. And the seventh angel poured his vial out Into the air, and a loud voice was heard Out of the temple's inmost shrine, which cried, All is fulfilled! At once an earthquake shook The ground, and lightnings, red and terrible, Flashed, and the thunders rolled along the sky, And strange and fearful voices in the air Were heard, so dreadful was that storm. Aghast, The nations fell; and the great Babylon Came in remembrance before God, to pour On her the fierceness of his wakened wrath. And now John saw another angel fly In clouds, and coming down with power from heaven Unto the earth; and all the earth beneath Was lighted with his glory; and he cried, With the loud voice of judgment, Babylon The great is fallen! And then another voice Answered, Come out of her! Hath she not said, I sit a queen, mighty as Ashtoreth? The kings of earth shall tremble when they see The smoke of her great torment; they shall stand Afar off from her burning, and shall cry, That mighty city, Babylon, alas! In one hour is her judgment come! The voice Of harpers and of trumpeters no more Shall in her streets be heard: the blood of saints, Of prophets, and of martyrs, is avenged! The cries are heard, the smoke is seen, no more. And after this, John lifted up his eyes, And heard the voice of mighty companies, Which sang and shouted, Alleluia! reign For ever, Lord of lords and King of kings! Salvation, honour, glory, power, and praise, Be unto thee, O Lord! for thou hast judged With righteousness! They, with acclaiming voice, Still sang and shouted, Alleluia—reign For ever, Lord of lords and King of kings! Heard through the empyrean, the great voice Again went up, whilst all the courts of heaven Rang, Alleluia! glory be to thee, Glory and power, Lord God Omnipotent! Then the heaven opened, and, behold! a horse As white as snow, and he who sat thereon Was called “True and Faithful;” on his head Were crowns on crowns, and underneath a name Which no man knew, save he who bore that name. His vesture was a robe of blood, and they Who followed him proclaimed, The Word of God! And all the heavenly armies followed him On horses white like his; and on his robe Was written—King of kings and Lord of lords. The pomp is passed, and now John raised his eyes, And saw an angel standing in the sun. The angel in his watch looked down to earth, And all the armies of the earth came forth To war with the bright chivalry of heaven, And Him who sat on the white horse! And, lo! Before the mighty cherubims advanced Michael, the great archangel, while a shout Rang, that the sun in heaven might seem to stand Still at a sound so terrible. Opposed To the great armies of the living God, Frown the Satanic host, far as the eye Can reach; and horses black as night, And spectre armies, led, in front, by Death, Appear, receding into farther depths Of blackness; while, anon, a dragon, scaled, Moves weltering onward. Michael, from the ranks Of cherubim advancing, lifts on high His mace, and full on the scaled dragon's crest Smites. At his feet the dragon lay, and, lo! The sable phantom-horsemen at the sight Are vanished. Raise the victor-song to Him Who rides on the white horse, and to his God In heaven, for the great dragon is cast down Into the bottomless and burning lake! Another angel, with white waving plume, Descends; an iron chain is in his hand, And the dark key of destiny, which shuts The bottomless abyss, from whence the smoke Ascends—ascends, but not a groan is heard. The ancient dragon is cast down, and bound— Bound for a thousand years, in chains, and thrown, Howling, into that nethermost abyss; While mercy, equity, and peace, and truth, Like angel forms, visit the earth, and move, Radiant as light, among the sons of men, And only sounds are heard of harmonies, Such as in heaven are sung about the throne, O'er which, in dewy light, the rainbow bends. The trump of bannered war, the sighs and groans Of miserable slaves, that rise from earth, In one deep murmur, to high heaven, are ceased; For love and mercy walk among mankind, And so shall walk, till the last trump shall sound. Now a new heaven and new earth appear; And, coming down from heaven, even as a bride Adorned to meet her husband, John beheld The City of the New Jerusalem, Glittering beyond the clouds; and then he heard A voice from a bright cloud, The Lord shall come And dwell with men, and he shall be their God; And God shall wipe from every eye the tear, And death shall be more! John spread his hands, And cried, with eyes upraised to heaven, Oh! stay, Visions of bliss! I am bowed down with age, Forlorn on earth, and I have tarried long Alone and sad. Oh! come, Lord Jesus Christ! A voice replied, Thou shalt be where he is! Hark! 'twas the billow beating on the rocks Of melancholy Patmos, and John wept, As, slowly fading, like a summer dream, He saw the towers, and gates, and palaces, Of New Jerusalem fade in the clouds Of eve, which shot its gleaming pinnacles Aloft in the pale sky, and flushed the track Of the sun's westering orb with crimson light. As the sun sunk, the sound of trump and horn Shrilled, and the old man, starting from his trance, Beheld below the cave the Roman troop, Stationed to guard the island criminals, Wind slow, in martial file, with banners spread, Returning to their tents. Ah! where are now The temples of the New Jerusalem, Glittering amid the clouds of parting day? Gone, like the rack; and Patmos' dreary isle And melancholy caves return the sound Of marching men, and the hoarse Roman trump. The Apostle to the entrance of his cave, The last remaining light on his gray hairs, Comes slowly forth, and rests upon his staff, When the rock-pigeon, at the trump disturbed, Flew to his withered hand. With plumed crest Upon his brazen helmet, holding high The ensign of command, an eagle borne Before him, on a spear, the præfect leads His legionary band; and as aloft The banners wave, and shields and corslets throw Back a pale glimmer, mark a mournful train Of fettered men move sullenly, with whom, Thoughtful, and with his hands upon his breast, His eyes, at times, uplifted to the heavens, One, as a soldier worn with toil, but marked With a stern sadness on his manly brow, Comes silently, a tear on his dark cheek. Near him, a youth, wan and emaciate, Leans on a female, by his side, in bloom Of youthful beauty; while, at intervals, Whene'er the trumpet ceased to ring, is heard The breath of muttering, and the clank of chains. John sighed, and, turning to the stranger, said (For both were at the entrance of the cave): Even to this desert spot in the lone waves, War, and the ensigns and the sounds of war, Have reached. His guest illustrious, with a smile, Answered: Yet this is the mere mimickry Of that appalling spectacle, that fills The world's wide scene with havoc and with blood; The murmur of whose mighty coil goes up Still to the ear of Heaven. So man, the worm, Preys on his fellow-worm. Turn from the earth, As gradual evening shades the sinking scene, And think upon its sins and strife no more. Come, let us, on the stone, before the cave, For all above is still and glorious, Sit down, and watch the stars as they steal out, One after one, and garnish the pale cope Of heaven. How bright the troops of Hesper shine, Above the shadow of yon farther rock, Whose western side is lustrous; for the moon, Ascending in her car of glory, casts A meditative and a solemn light From cape to cape! Look! there is Helice, Watched by the Grecian traders of the deep— How clear she shines to-night above the sea! High in the zenith, here and there, apart, Some solitary stars, now scarce discerned, Seem to retire into the farthest space, As if to shun the prouder planet's gaze, Each in his watch, with never-blenching eye, Steadfast. Nor marvel, then the stranger said, When all the silent host of the blue sky Appear so beautiful, Idolatry Should deem them gods, and to the Sun and Moon, Bel and Astarte, pay the worship due To the invisible, Almighty Lord, Who rules in heaven and earth. Is there a God? Yes! Nature cries aloud, There is a God, Visible in his works, and infinite In power! There is a God, and he is just! There is a God, and he is merciful! Yet might we rather say, there is no God, Than think, that to a being such as man No revelation of bright hope was given: That man, created in God's image, placed Amid this vast and unknown universe, To sojourn upon earth a few brief years Of feverish life, should look, for the last time, Hopeless, upon the setting sun, and die. Oh! better be the worm that feeds on him. With lifted gaze, the last Apostle cried, Fervently cried, Oh! yes, Lord Jesus Christ, Thou art the Christian's hope! but most of me— Of me, whom thou hast visited, and cheered Through life's long pilgrimage; of me, of me, In age and solitude; I, too, shall live When all the clouds of time are rolled away, For ever live in glory where thou art! Retiring to the cave, pausing, he turned To his companion, but he was not there; The moon shone, but there was no form or shape Of living thing; so lonely to his cave, O'erwearied, John retired, there musing lay On what he saw and heard, till sleep unawares Oppressed him, and that night—that only night— He had not fallen upon his knees, and prayed, Protect me through this night, O Lord my God! When, suddenly, a hiss was heard without, And the dull hurtle, as of iron wings, And short and intermitted flames, at times, Lighted the cavern roof; then all again Was dark, save when the moon dilated hung, And all again was still. John's heavy eyes Were closed; and dreaming half, and half awake, He slumbered in the cavern. Who art thou? Starting, he cried, and trembled, for strange eyes Glared through the dusk, and seemed to look at him. It was the coinage of the aged brain, When sadness and the sense of loneliness Oppress the weary heart! His eyes are closed A moment, when strange voices, in the air, Syllable words unknown, as mocking him, Then all is hushed again: from the dark roof Fantastic and deriding shapes, half seen, Point down long fingers, and a laugh is heard From the dark fissure of the rocky cave, Till even his shadow, by a moon-glance seen, Seems joining the fantastic mockery. Strange forms of beasts and birds, with monstrous beaks Solemnly nodding, in the dusk appear. Yonder, by moonlight, all with heads hung down, There moves a shrouded and a moping train, But not a form distinctly visible, Save of a corpse, that silently they bear, On which the moonlight falls. Now a dark cloud Is interposed, and the dim troop dissolves. Forthwith a spectre, towering to the skies, Moves onward—on, directly to the cave; And, towering higher as he moves, he lifts— Half cloud and half anatomy—a dart, Barbed with fire, and a deep voice is heard, Through the involving clouds about his head: I am Apollyon; dost thou sleep, old man? Tremble—and die! John raised his eyes, and prayed, Still shuddering, Save me, save me, Jesus Christ! The spectre vanished: some faint lightning shone At distance; and now gentler forms drew nigh, With airy minstrelsy of harps unseen, Surrounding him, like shadows of the blessed: Here, radiant female forms came gliding by; There, in a stream of light, an angel turned His look upon him, while soft voices sing: Christian, dost thou yet remain In this weary world of pain? Dost thou bend thy hoary head When all beloved on earth are dead? Hast thou oft, by years oppressed, Prayed for rest, eternal rest? Lo! we come, ere morning peep, To sing thee to thy rest asleep. ECHO FROM THE CAVE. Asleep. VOICES. Asleep. Sing thee to thy rest asleep. ECHO. Asleep. Then came another song, like lullabies Of ocean, mingled with the airs of night: Whilst a mother's only child Rests in short and sweet repose, All her troubles are beguiled When its placid eyelids close! But angels watch beside the bed Where aged Christians rest their head, And as their watchful vigils cease, Parting, they whisper, Peace! ECHO FROM THE CAVE. Peace. PARTING VOICES. Peace. Tired nature sank to sleep, like infancy Soft-breathing, and as calm. Then, in a dream, The shades of mitred and majestic James, Peter, and Paul, came up. He heard their voice, And saw their forms, as when they lived on earth. James looked upon his beard of snow, and said: We have borne witness to the truth in blood; But thy old age shall calmly pass away, Till death be lost in sleep. Then thou shalt wake In everlasting bliss, to weep no more, For He whom thou hast seen shall be with thee, And we shall live together—where He is. After a placid and refreshing sleep, The last Apostle raised his eyes, and saw The same majestic and mysterious man Who stood before him in the cave, and now The dim dawn broke on the Ægean deep. PART FIFTH. Day-break—Ascend the highest Mountain—Comparison with the Vision on Mount Tabor—Transfiguration—View to East and West—Ship descried from the East—Descend. John, gazing on the glimmering eastern surge, Sat with fixed eyes, when thus the stranger spake: Up! for the Word and Spirit of the Lord Are come to me. Let us ascend, old man, The summit of Elijah's cliff, that hangs High o'er the ocean surge, and see the sun Rise o'er the Ægean solitude to-day. John answered, Can these feeble limbs sustain The labour up the long and slow ascent, Step by step, when I feel my strength decay Daily, and draw my breath with pain? Thy God Will give thee strength, the stranger said, and took His trembling hand, and led his feeble step Slow up the hill; and ever as they went, And the horizon widened, in his heart John felt a strange reviving power, that braced His sinews, and gave a vigour to his steps, Conquering the pain and labour of the way: But needs not pain or labour, for a thought Hath brought them there, the white hairs, in the wind, Of John, yet gently stirring, and his cheek Just lighted with a transient glow; and now Both stood upon the promontory's point, Thoughtful and silent: soon they saw the sun Slowly emerging, a vast orb of fire, Above the shadowy edge of ocean; now Flaming direct o'er Asia, with a stream Of long illumination, on the clouds, Marked with confusion of rich hues, and thence Touching the nearer promontory's height, Pale cliffs, and eagles' wings above the clouds, And now careering through the heaven, supreme, Full and magnificent, in loneliness Of glory. When the rays first touched his brow, Then more exalted, and of larger frame, The stranger seemed to grow, as not of earth, Or earth's inhabitants; so tall his form, So glorified his aspect. John had fallen Upon his knees, but a mild voice rebuked: See that thou do it not; hast thou received Or strength or comfort, give the thanks to God. John, resting on the crag of the wild rock, Looked up, and then to his companion spoke: Not uninstructive hath thy converse been, Nor unrefreshing to my weary heart Thy presence; more so, in a scene like this, Raised, as it were, above the shade and clouds Of transient time. And so, long since, my soul Felt a divine refreshment, when I stood Upon the mount of vision with our Lord That day when in transfigured form he rose. Oh! well do I remember it, who saw, With James and Peter, by the sight oppressed, The glorious apparition. Each stray cloud Wandered far off, and lost in the blue sky, And not a freckle stained the firmament High overhead. The mystic mount itself, Tabor, seemed rising up to heaven, and loomed In such illumination, that the track Below, and all the plains of Galilee, Rivers and lake to the great western sea, Looked cold and dim, even in the morning sun; Such was the glory of the sudden blaze That wrapped the mount. The crowd of lesser hills On to the city of Tiberias, Appeared below o'er which the eagle sailed, Mute, for his eyes yet blenched from the excess Of light, unlike the sun, that startled him, With bursting splendour, where he slept. He flew, High soaring o'er the hills of Jezreel, On to the mountains of Samaria. We fell upon the ground, and with our hands Covered our faces, when we raised our eyes, We saw three glorified appearances; Two, as of aged prophets, with their beards Streaming; each held a book, and in the midst, And, buoyant in the air, his countenance Bright as the sun, our Saviour's form appeared Above them, while his vest, intensely white, Floated, as thus transfigured he arose. With clasped hands, and eyes upraised to heaven, Peter, in joy and wonder, ardently Cried: Let us build three tabernacles here, To Moses, and Elias, and to thee, Saviour and God! not knowing what he said. A cloud now interposed between the light, Softening its glory, while a voice was heard From the bright cloud, Lo, my beloved Son— Hear him! At once the shadowy imagery, The visionary pomp, the radiant cloud, Were rolled away, and Jesus stood alone; For they who held high converse, and whose forms, Appeared in thinner air, above the blaze, Were gone with the departing cloud: his hand He placed upon our heads, and said, Fear not! And that calm look of dignity and love Was placed upon us, as before. Again We saw the sun—the cloudless cope of heaven— The long green valley of Esdraelon— The pines of dewy Hermon, and the smoke Of Nain, where once a widowed mother wept Her lost and only son, whom Jesus raised From death's cold sleep, restoring to her tears Of joy; we saw the cavern and the cliffs Of Endor, where the wizard-woman called Up from his sleep of death the prophet old, To tell to trembling Saul his hour was come. Oh! hills, and streams, and plains of Palestine; Scenes where we heard, long since, our Master's voice, And saw his face! how often, with a tear, Have I remembered you, how often sighed: Oh! for the swiftness of an eagle's wing, That I might flee away, and visit you Once more! But this great vision of the mount, With shadowings of glory, was displayed, That we might be sustained in the dread day Of trial, when the very rocks should burst— When, through deep darkness, the loud cry should come: My God, my God, hast thou forsaken me? That we might be prepared, through every ill, In peril and in pain, in life, in death; Though persecution, famine, and the sword, Fronted our way, prepared to hold right on; Calm to take up our cross, and follow Him Who meekly bowed his head upon that cross; For if in this life only we had hope, We were of all most miserable. Lord, Thee have I followed, now in age, and poor, Thy sufferings were for us—for us? for me; For me thy bleeding side was pierced, for me Thy spirit groaned! Oh! come, Lord Jesus Christ! Oh! come, for I have tarried long on earth; Come, Lord and Saviour! have I prayed in vain? Thou didst appear in glory on the mount; And thou hast come, even now, and cried, Fear not, I live for evermore, and have the keys Of death and hell. And wherefore should I fear, Now waiting only to depart in peace! But I have wandered in my thoughts; this view From this high mountain, and congenial thoughts, Have waked the memory of that vision bright, When once we saw, above the clouds of earth, Our Lord in glistening apparel shine. Then he who stood upon the mountain's van With John, and gazed upon the seas below, Said, Look towards the East: what dost thou see? John answered, There is nothing but the clouds And seas. And both were silent. STRANGER. Look again. John answered, There is nothing but the clouds And seas, and the great sun above the waves, That goeth forth in beauty. STRANGER. Look again. John answered, Yes, upon the farthest line Of the blue ocean-track, there is a speck Of light; no; yes; there is a distant sail In sight; it seems as speeding hitherward. STRANGER. Enough. Look to the west: what seest thou there? JOHN. Ah! all that hid the vast and various scene Slowly withdraws, like morning mist. I see Regions, in light and shade, beyond the isles, Delos and Mycone, mountains and capes Unfolding, through the mist, as if they stood Beneath our feet. There, bays, and gulfs, and plains, And wandering streams appear; and o'er them, high Upon a hill, in the pale atmosphere, A temple vast, as of some god renowned In pagan lands. STRANGER. Thou seest the shores of Greece, And that the illustrious city, so renowned, Athens; upon that hill, the hill of Mars, Paul stood, when, pointing to the skies above, He spoke of fanes “not made with hands;” of God, Who liveth in the heaven. What seest thou more? JOHN. Another land, stretched, like a giant's arm, Across the deep, with seas on either side. There, on seven hills, I see a city, crowned With glittering domes; the nether champagne spread With aqueducts, and columns, arches, and towers. STRANGER. It is the Imperial Mistress of the World, Rome—Rome—now pagan; but a power unknown Shall rise, and, throned on those seven hills— When Cæsars moulder with their palaces, Shall hold dominion o'er the prostrate world, Not by their glittering legions, but the power Of cowled Superstition, that shall keep Kingdoms and kings in thrall; till, with a shout, A brighter angel, from the heaven of heavens, As ampler knowledge shoots her glorious beams, Shall open the Lamb's book again, and night, Beckoning her dismal shadows, and dark birds, Fly hooting from the dayspring of that dawn. Burns not thy heart to think upon those days! But long and dire shall be the tale of blood; Let it be hid for ever! Look again: JOHN. I see the pillars and the rocky bounds That gird this inland sea. STRANGER. What seest thou more? JOHN. I see a ship burst through the narrow frith Into the sea of darkness and of storms, There lost in boundless solitudes. Oh! no, There is an island; with its chalky cliffs, Beauteous it rises from the billowy waste. STRANGER. Thither that ship is bound: nor storms, nor seas, Rocking in more terrific amplitude, Impede its course. Long years shall roll away, And when deep night shall wrap again the shores, Of Asia; where the “golden candlestick” Now gleams, illumining the pagan world; And where a few poor Christian fishermen Shall here and there be found; even where thy Church Of Ephesus stood in the light of heaven, From that far isle, amid the desert waves, Back, like the morning on the darkened east, To lands long hid, in ocean-depths unknown, The radiance of the gospel shall go forth, And the Cross float triumphant o'er the world. JOHN. Even now, in vision rapt of days to come, I see her Christian temples, pale in air, Above the smoke of cities; o'er the deep I see her fleets, innumerable, spread, Chequering, like shadows, the remotest main; And, lo! a river, winding in the light, Silent, amid a vast metropolis, Beneath the spires, and towers, and glittering domes! Ah! they are vanished, and a sudden cloud Hides, from the straining sight, temple, and tower, And battlement. STRANGER. Pray that it pass away. JOHN. Ah! the pale horse and rider! the pale horse Is there! silence is in the streets! The ark Of her majestic polity, the Church— The temple of the Lord—I see no more! STRANGER. Pray that her faith preserve her: the event Is in His hands who bade his angels sound Their trumps, or pour the avenging vials out. Let us descend, the wind is fresh and fair, Direct from the north-east; let us descend. And they descended, silently and slow, Towards the craggy cave, and rested there, Looking upon the sunshine on the waves Of the pale-blue Ægean, still intent, Watching the sail, that, by the western beam Illumined, held its course towards the shore. Icarian figs furnished a scant repast, With water from the rock, after their toil; While they, within the cave, conversing sat Of virtue and of vice, of sin and death, Of youth and age, and pleasure's flowery path, Leading to sorrow and untimely death. PART SIXTH. Reflections—Grecian Girl and Dying Libertine—Reflections on Past History of the World—Angel's Disappearance—Ship brings the Elders of Ephesus to invite John to return—Parting from Patmos, and Last Farewell. Then the mysterious and majestic man Thus spoke: Among the banished criminals, As they passed yesterday, didst thou not mark A pale, emaciate youth, and by his side, Oft looking in his altered face, with tears, A beauteous Grecian female! He was one Who crowned his hair with roses; trod the path Of love and pleasure, till the vision fled, And left him here, an outcast criminal, Soon, without hope, to sink into the grave, And leave his young companion desolate! So ends a life of pleasure! Woe for them, The young, the gay, the guilty, who rejoice In life's brief sunshine, then are swept away, Forgotten as the swarms in summer time. As thus he spake, smiling amid her tears, With eyes that flashed beneath dishevelled hair, A female stood before them. Look on me, She sighed, and spake: No! father, hear my prayer: At Corinth I was born; my mother died When I was yet a very child; my sire Trafficked to Tyre, and when my mother died, He left the woods, the hills, and shores of Greece To seek a dwelling-place in Asia, At Tyre or Smyrna; but the tempest rose, And cast his vessel on the rocky coast Of Cyprus. I was found upon the shore, Escaped I know not how, for he was dead; And pitying strangers bore me to the fane Of Paphian Venus. There my infancy Grew up in opening beauty, like the rose, Ere summer has unfolded it; I looked Upon the dove's blue eyes; how sorrowful, That it must die—upon the altar die; And then it seemed still dearer, and I heard Its murmuring on my bosom with a tear, Kissing it; but a young Athenian, Whom Epicurus taught that life's sweet prime Was like the rose; for whom Anacreon Sang, Let us seize the moments as they fly, And bind our brows with clusters of the vine; Roaming, in summer, the Ægean deep, Enticed me from the shrines of her I served, And led me with him (for he had a boat, Charmed by the syrens) led from isle to isle. Joyous and reckless were his youthful crew, Their hair with myrtle and with roses wreathed, Who dipped the oar, in cadence, to the sound Of dulcimer, and tambourine, and lute, While damsels, like immortal goddesses, Their light hair gently waving to the breath Of summer, in the bloom and light of youth, Sang with accord of dulcet harmony, As if to charm the seas; and Cupid sat Aloft, his small right hand upon the helm, While with the left he loosed the purple sail Free to the morning zephyrs. So we sailed, With music on the waters, sailed along, And thought not of the sounds of a sad world We had forsaken; while the lute thus woke The echoes of the listening Cyclades: Go, tell that pining boy to cast His willow wreath away; For though life's spring too soon is past, Though youth's sweet roses fade too fast, They shall not fade to-day. Nay, father, frown not thus like withering care, He who is old may yet remember hours Of happiness like these, and will forgive; And wilt not thou, my father, wilt not thou? From Cyprus, island of the Queen of Love, We came to Naxos, and I joined the train Of bacchanals, still singing, as we danced Upon the mountains, to the bell and pipe, Evoe, Bacchus! Thence we sailed away, Careless, in the bright sunshine of the morn, And never thought the tempest would arise To cloud our happy days; but, hark! the storm Of night is howling round us; not a star In heaven appears, to light our wintry way; Alas! the pinnace, with its company, Was dashed upon the rocks of Attica, Where stern Minerva stood, and with her spear Shivered it into fragments at her feet. Cast on the shore, again I sought the fane Of her I served in Paphos, and once more Danced round the altars of the Queen of Love. He, scarce escaping, all his substance gone, Joined the sea-robbers; and of late, I heard, Was banished to this isle, a criminal, Wasted by slow disease, and soon to die. My father, I have heard that thou canst call Spirits from heaven, of such strange potency, They can awake the dead, restore to life The dying: oh! restore the youth I loved, And bring the rose to his pale cheek again! JOHN. Unhappy child! the path of pleasure leads To sorrow in this world, and in the next. GRECIAN GIRL. The next! the next! My father, I have heard That thou dost worship a new God—a God Who has no priestess. I can dance and sing Light as Euphrosyne, and I can weep For pity, and can sigh, how tenderly! For love; and if thou wilt restore that youth To health and love, oh! I will kneel to thee, And offer sacrifice, morning and eve To thy great God, and weave a coronal, When I have culled the choicest flowers of Rhodes, Father, to crown those few white hairs of thine. John answered, I will pray for him and thee; But leave me, child, now leave me to those prayers. The man of loftier wisdom spoke again: How sing the thoughtless in their songs of joy, Our days of happiness, at best, are short And profitless, and in the death of man There is no remedy, for we are born, And we shall sleep hereafter in the dust, As we had never been; so all our days Are vanity, our breath but as a smoke, A vapour, and we turn again to earth; And this high spirit vanishes in air— Into thin air; our very name shall be Forgotton, and Oblivion on our works Sit silent, while our days have sped away As clouds that leave no trace, or as a mist Dispersed and scattered by the noonday sun! Time is itself the shadow of a shade, Hurrying; and when our tale of days is told, The tomb is sealed, and who ever rose, To stand again beneath the light of day! Then let us crown with rosebuds, ere they fade, Our brows, and pass no blooming flower of spring! Such heartless sophistries have still deceived Earth's poor wayfarers, they who know not God, For God created man—oh! not to die Eternally, but live, for ever live (So he be found holy, and just, and pure), The image of himself! What dost thou see? Thine eyes are fixed, and turned on vacancy. John said, I see the dead, both great and small, Stand before God; the loud archangel's trump Hath ceased to thunder o'er the bursting graves; How deep, how dread the silence, as that book Is opened! Ah! there is another book. STRANGER. It is the Book of Life; the dead are judged According to their works. JOHN. Above the throne Interminable space of glorious light Is spread, and angel-troops and hierarchies, With golden harps, half-seen, into the depths Of that interminable light recede, Till the tired vision shrinks. The sea, the sea, Gives up its dead! and Death and Hell pour forth, All hushed and pale, their countless multitudes, Shivering to meet the light; and millions pray, In silence: Hide us, hide us, earth, again! A gulph, beneath them, black as tenfold night, Glaring at times with intermittent flames, Opens; and, hark! sad sounds, and shrieks of woe, Come through the darkness. At the dreadful voice, Depart from me, ye cursed! John, amazed, Looked 'round: he saw the blue Ægean shine, And the approaching sail white in the wind. Then he who stood by him thus spoke: Awake; Let us toward the sea, for, look! the ship Approaches nearer to the eastern bay. As near, and still more near, she speeds her course, On this gray column, prostrate in the dust, Its tale unknown, the sole sad relic here Of perishable glory, and, who knows, Perhaps a pillar of some marble fane, Raised to dark pagan idols, let us rest, And muse upon the change of mortal things. The Apostle sat, and as he watched the sail, Leaned on his staff to hear. The stranger spoke: Lo! the last fragment of departed days, This shaft of a fallen column; and even so Shall all the monuments of human pride Be smitten to the desert dust, like those Who raised them, long to desert dust returned. Where are the hundred gates of regal Thebes! Let the clouds answer, and the silent sands. Where is the Tower of Babel, proudly raised, As to defy the Lord, above the clouds! He raised his arm, and, as a dream, it sank. Waters of Babylon, by thy sad shores The children of captivity sat down, Sat down and wept, when they remembered thee, O Sion! But the trump and cornet bray; It is Belshazzar's midnight feast! He sits A god among his lords and concubines. A thousand torches flame aloof; the songs Of wantonness and blasphemy go up! And are those golden vessels, from the shrine And temple of the living God, brought forth, In impious derision? Does the hymn Resound to Baal, and the gods of gold? And at this hour, do all the princes rise? Is the wine poured from vessels which the Lord Had consecrated? Do they drink, and cry, The King shall live for ever? Ah! how changed His countenance! he trembles, and his knees, Smite one against the other! Look, how changed! God of eternal justice, what is that? The fingers of a man, against the wall, Moving in shadow, and inscribing words Of dreadful import, but which none may read. Call the Chaldeans and Astrologers! Are they all mute? Call the poor captive slave, Daniel, the prophet of the Lord! The crowd All turn their looks in silence, with their breath Hushed by their terrors. Has he spoken? Yes! Thy sceptre is departed! Hear, O King! He hears and trembles; and that very night, He who blasphemed is gone to meet his Judge! Proclaim the conquering Persian; it was God Who led his armies forth, who called his name Cyrus; and under him again shall rise The temple at Jerusalem, shall rise In beauty and in glory, till the day Of tribulation smite it to the earth, As we have seen! Weep for Jerusalem; But in the light of heaven, the Church of Christ Shall lift its battlements, till He shall come, With all his jubilant, acclaiming hosts, Amid the clouds! The old man raised his eyes, And on his forehead placed his withered hand, A moment musing; then he turned his look Again to his companion at his side. Ah! he is gone; but, hark! a rustling sound Is heard, and, bright above the eastern cliffs, Behold, a glorious angel's pennons spread. Look! he ascends into the azure depth Of light; he still ascends, till the blue sky Is only interrupted by some clouds Of lightest brede and beauty, o'er the sea Transparent hung. John gazed with hands outspread, But nothing in the airy track was seen, Save those small clouds. Then pensive he sat down, His withered hands extending as in prayer. But, lo! the vessel drops its sail; a boat Is hurrying, smooth and rapid, through the spray— The sounds of men are heard—see, they approach! Yes, they are messengers of peace! they come With tidings to the lonely habitant. Two elders of the Church of Ephesus Greet him with salutations from the ship Whose banner streams—the banner of the Cross— Beneath the rocks of Patmos: from the beach The elders slow advanced, and one thus spoke: Hail, father! Cæsar is no more! Thy Church At Ephesus again, by us, implores Thy presence and thy guidance; and, behold! The bark now waits to bear thee o'er the deep, For Nerva has reversed the stern decree Passed for thy banishment: arise, return, Return; for now the light of heaven again Gleams on the temple of our infant faith; The radiance of the “golden candlestick,” That shone in the deep darkness of the earth, Shall flame more bright. Arise—arise—return! John took their hands, and, blessing them, gave thanks To God who rules above; then cried, I go— With many thronging thoughts—back to the world, To wait how Heaven may yet dispose my lot, Till the grave close upon my pilgrimage. Yet would I stay a while, to bid farewell To that, my cave, where I have seen strange things, And heard strange voices, and have passed five years In loneliness and watching, and in prayer. Let me not part till I have said farewell! Hereafter I shall tell what I have seen. But now, O Lord and Saviour! strengthen me, A poor old man, returning to the world; Oh! look and let me feel thy presence now, Whom I have served so long. I shall not see Again thy glorious form upon the earth, But I have lived to see thy Church arise, Now in its infancy, and gathering power From day to day; and thou shalt be adored Till the remotest isles, and every land, Shall praise and magnify thy glorious name! My days are well-nigh told, and few remain, But I shall live, protected, to record, O Lord and Saviour! all which I have seen, High and mysterious; as I declared, In the beginning was the Word; the Word, In the beginning, was with God; the Word Was God! And now farewell! Oh! may I pass What yet remains of life in faith and hope, Till Christ shall call me in his mercy hence, And lead me gently to my last repose. Then may his Church, which he has raised on earth, Stand, though the tempest shake its battlements; Stand, till the trumpet, the last trumpet sound, And He shall come in clouds who founded it! As thus he spoke, his stature seemed to grow More lofty, with a step more firm he trod; Whilst a mild radiance, lambent on his face, Shone, as the radiance from the mercy-seat. He held his way, oft looking back to mark The cave where he had lived, when, lo! the dove, So often fed from his pale hand, has left The cliff, and flies, faint-murmuring, round his hair. And now he turns his eyes upon the deep; Yet scarce had reached the margin, when he saw The sullen dwellers on these rugged shores, Led on by him who had confessed his sins— The robber of Mount Carmel, in his chains— Kneel at his feet. They blessed him, sorrowing That they should see his face on earth no more. The stern centurion hid a starting tear; The poor emaciate youth knelt down, and she Who tended him with love and tenderness, Wept, as he faintly sank, and breathed his last, His hands extending feebly, as he sunk, To John, in fervent prayer! The Grecian girl Fell, desolate and sobbing, on his breast. But, lo! the wind has veered, and, streaming out, The red cross pennant points to Asia, As heaven-directed. Speed, ye mariners! The sails are swelling, and the widening deep Is all before you, surging to the gale. So they kept on their course to Ephesus, And o'er the Ægean waves beheld, far off, The cave, the lonely sands and lessening capes Of dreary Patmos sink to rise no more. THE SORROWS OF SWITZERLAND. PART FIRST. Why art thou come, man of despair and blood! To these green vales and streams, o'erhung with wood; These hills, where, far from life's discordant throng, The lonely goat-maid chaunts her matin song; This sylvan glen, where age in peace reclines, Soothed by the whisper of his native pines; Where, in the twilight of his closing days, Upon the glimmering lake he loves to gaze; And, like his life, sees on the shadowy flood, The still, sweet eve descending! Man of blood, Break not his holy musings! Innocence And peace these vales inhabit. Hie thee hence To the waste wilderness, the mournful main, To caves where silence and deep stillness reign, Where God's eye only can the gloom pervade; And shroud thy visage in their dreariest shade! Or, if these scenes, so beauteous, may impart A momentary softness to thine heart, Let nature plead, plead for a guiltless land, Ere yet thou lift'st the desolating brand; Ere yet thou bidst the peaceful echoes swell With havoc's shouts and many a mingled yell! Pause yet a moment! By the beard Of him whose eyes to heaven are reared; By her who frantic lifts her helpless hand; By those poor little ones, that speechless stand; If thou hast nature in thee, oh relent, Nor crush the lowly shed of virtue and content! No golden shrines can tempt thy plunder here, No jealous castles their dark turrets rear. Peeping at dawn among the mountain vines, The village pastor's simple mansion shines Beneath the tower, the music of whose bells Soft o'er the azure lake each Sabbath swells. No lighted halls that blaze till morn reply To sounds of proud, voluptuous revelry; But one sweet pipe, by lingering lover played, Cheers the dim valley as the day-tints fade; Whilst, 'mid the rocks, the torrents, and the trees, Her little world, with pride, affection sees. Survey the prospect well. Soldier! dost thou (Thy blood-red plumage waving o'er thy brow) Bid the poor villagers, who in the shed Of their forefathers eat their virtuous bread, To hard oppression bend the prostrate knee, Or learn benevolence and love from thee! And dost thou talk of freedom! Freedom here Lifted with death-denouncing frown her spear; Here joining her loud voice's solemn call To the deep thunders of the waterfall, She hailed her chosen home: these dark woods rang As her bold war-song on the rocks she sang. At once a thousand banners to the air Streaming, a thousand falchions brandished bare, Proclaimed her sons' dread homage: We will die Or live thy children, holiest Liberty! Oh think of this! Alas! the voice is vain; Poor injured land, thy brave, thy blameless train, Thy lovely landscapes, bursting bright around, Thy gleam that echoed every cheering sound, Thy rocks that gleamed with many a high-hung cot, And Freedom's holy name, avail thee not! Then rise, insulted country! in despair Lift thy brave arm so terrible, and swear, Swear thou wilt never sheathe the avenging steel Till thou hast made the fell invader feel How vain the terrors of his glittering crest, How warm the flame that fires a patriot's breast! How nerved their arm, opposed to tenfold might, Who for the dearest hopes, their homes, their offspring fight! And, hark! even now, methought stern Freedom called, From the wild shores of rocky Underwald! Rush like the mountain avalanche on those Who, foes to you, my sons, are Virtue's foes! Lo, where the legions of insulting France Already on your ravaged plains advance; See your pale daughters, they for mercy plead; Behold your white-haired sires, they sink, they bleed! Oh! yet your patriot energies unite To quell the insolent oppressor's might! Behold the scene where your forefathers broke And sternly trampled on the Austrian yoke! Behold the spot where the undaunted band First met, and, clasping each his brother's hand, Bade the Almighty hear their solemn vow, That never should their injured country bow, A slave! then lifted in the midnight air Their spears, whilst the dun rocks echoed—We swear! Think that the dead behold you! He whose bow Laid the grim tyrant of these valleys low, On yonder eminence yet seems to stand; To you he dimly waves his awful hand: Go forth, my sons, in each bold bosom swell The injured spirit of another Tell! And rush, like yon huge avalanche, on those Who, foes to you, are Freedom's, Virtue's foes! So Freedom spake: she stood august and high; Like a pale meteor shone her troubled eye; She smote her shield, and, with indignant look, More awful her uplifted war-spear shook. From many a wild and woodland solitude, O'erhung with snowy-silvered mountains rude; From glassy lakes, or where the brawling brook Wells, sparkling, through some beech-embowered nook; From scattered chalets, decked with mantling vines, Above whose blue smoke wave the impending pines; From many a covert green, or gleaming rock, The bold defenders of their country flock! Upon a cliff, that at gray morning throws Its shadow o'er the deep clear lake's repose, Their gallant leader stands. Children, he cries, And one sad tear-drop gathers in his eyes, Their arms prevail! Helvetia mourns in vain! Bound by the ruthless victor's galling chain, We only 'mid these rocky ramparts find Brief shelter from the vultures of mankind; Hither they speed their desolating sway, They flap their bloody pinions o'er their prey; But we have hearts, my brethren, and we know What to our country and our God we owe; And we have arms, arms that may make them rue (Though rude our ramparts, our defenders few), The hour when they assailed this last retreat. Feel we our hearts beat high, our pulses beat? Death calls us, yet, oh, lowly let us bend, And pray to Him who is the poor man's friend, That he would guard our orphans when we bleed, And shield them in the bitter hour of need! Now, soldier, let thy huge artillery roar, Thy marshalled columns flash along the shore, Thy armed transports with long shadow ride Terrific o'er the lake's once tranquil tide, And thy loud trumpets bray, as in disdain Of the poor tenants of the snowy plain. They fear thee not, they are oppression's foes; Unscared, thy march of carnage they oppose; Though their fallen brethren have in vain withstood; Though yet thy sword be red with their best blood; Thy sword, thy steeds, thy legions, they defy, And death is couched within their flashing eye! Age has new energies; in traces weak An angry hectic rises on his cheek; And as his time-touched features kindling glow, Lead me, he cries, yet lead me to the foe! Stern manhood o'er his boy low murmuring bends, Then, as his deadly weapon he extends, Proudly exclaims, Freedom or death, my son! And thou, O God of justice, lead us on! Hark! with one shout they rush into the fight, The pale foe shrinks before their gathering might! Fragments of rocks in wild despair they wield, And helms and shivered swords bestrew the field. The frantic mother, hushing every grief, Joins the dread scene, and to some plumed chief All pale with rage, with desperation wild, Cries, as she smites his heart: Hadst thou a child! Unequal strife! the scene of death is o'er; Mother and child lie side by side in gore! When evening comes, through the lone cottage pane, No light looks cheerful in the darkening plain, No soothing sounds stray the dim hills along, No home-returning goat-herd trills the song; At intervals, wild accents of despair, Or shouts are heard, or dismal nightfires glare; But all is dark and silent near yon heap Where the fallen heroes of the hamlet sleep; Save that, at times, a hollow groan is heard, Or melancholy cry of the night-bird; Save where some dog, amid the scene of death, Moans as he watches yet his master's breath; Whilst with despair and love that seems to speak, He licks the blood that stagnates on his cheek. The morn looks through the hurrying clouds, the air Sighs as it lifts, at times, the dead man's hair; Upon those slaughtered heaps the cold stars shine, And Freedom sighs: The triumph, Gaul, is thine! Now dawns the morn o'er vales with blood defiled, Where late affection's sweetest pictures smiled. O'er the still lake how sadly peals the bell That sounds of every earthly hope the knell! Pale on the crimsoned snow, without a home, The sad survivors of that death-storm roam; Their infants, outcast on the desert plain, Demand their mothers and their sires in vain; And when the red sun leaves the darkening sky, Amid those gory tracks sit down and sigh. Shores of Lucerne! where many a winding bay Shone beauteous to the morn's returning ray; Where rosy tints upon the blue lake shone, And touched the rock with colours not their own; Who now, with eyes that swim in tenderness, Those scenes to every virtue dear shall bless! What pleasure now can the rich landscape yield, The sparkling cataract, the pendent field, 'Mid hoar declivities, the sunny tower Peering o'er beeches that its roof embower, And cottage tops with light smoke trailing slow O'er the gray vapours looming far below! Who shall ascend proud Pilate's height, and mark The motley clouds sail o'er the champagne dark, Now breaking in fantastic forms, and now Dappling the distant promontory's brow? Then when the sun, that lights the scene, rides high, And far away the scattered volumes fly, Look up to the great God that rules the world, By whom proud empires from their seats are hurled, And feel a glow of holy gratitude, That here, 'mid hollow glens and mountains rude, Far from Ambition's march and Discord's yell, Content with Love and Happiness should dwell. Who now along those banks shall, listening, stray When evening lights each inlet west away, And hear the solitary boatman's oar Dip duly as he nears the shaded shore; Or catch the whispers of the waterfall That through the ivied clefts swell musical? These scenes, these sounds, could many a joy impart, With sadness mixed. The wandering youth, whose heart Was sick with many sorrows, resting here At such an hour, forgot his starting tear; He felt a pensive calm, sweeter than sleep, Steal gently o'er his aching breast; the deep And clear repose of the unruffled lake His spirit seemed, unconscious, to partake; And still the water, as it whispered near, Or high woods, as they rustled, soothed his ear, Like the remembrance of a melody Heard in his infant, happy years gone by. Now in his distant country, when, with tears, The tale of ruffian violence he hears; Hears that the spot which smiled with lovely gleam, Like some sweet image of a tender dream, Upon his morning path, is drenched with gore, Its harmless tenants weltering on the shore; He will exclaim, whilst from his breast he draws A deep, deep sigh, Avenge, O God, their cause! Who would not sigh for Switzerland! What heart That ever bore in human woes a part; That ever felt affection's genuine flame; That ever leaped at injured Freedom's name; Would not for her dark foes feel honest hate, And swell with indignation at her fate! If thus her lot of sorrow have impressed Grief and resentment on a stranger's breast, How must he hear the cruel tale of death, He who in these sad vales first drew his breath! 'Tis his perhaps in distant climes to roam, Far from the shelter of his early home; Yet still, as fancy paints the spot, he sees His father's cottage, and the mountain trees; Again by the wild streams he seems to rove; He hears the voice of her who won his love, His heart's first love; for her he prunes the vine, Whose clustering leaves the rustic porch entwine; The mountain's van together they ascend; They see Alps piled on Alps far on extend; They mark the casual sunshine light the mass, Or vernal showers along the valley pass; Whilst tinging the dark rocks, more lovely glow The braided colours of heaven's humid bow. But now the maid he loved, with whom all day He used in summer o'er the hills to stray, The faithful maid he loved—oh! cold despair, Freeze his warm life-blood; and that thrilling air, Which erst he sang, when, all alive to joy, He carolled on the Alps, a shepherd boy, Let him not hear it now, lest tears quick start, And madness harrow up his broken heart! How touching was the simple strain! The tear Of memory started when it met the ear; And he whose front was rough with many a scar, Whose bold heart bounded at the trump of war, Stood all dissolved in sadness at its tone, Remembering him of pleasant seasons gone. Perhaps full many a heavy hour had passed, Since in its native nooks he heard it last; And when again its well-known music thrilled, A thousand thronging recollections filled His soul, that, sick with longing, homeward roved; Remote from scenes which most on earth he loved, Cast on a world tempestuous, bleak, and wide, More ardent for his once-loved hills he sighed; And sighed again to think how it might fare With sisters, brothers, friends, and parents there; For be its music and its name forgot, The desert is his home, and those he loved are not! PART SECOND. I was a child of sorrow when I passed, Sweet country, through your rocky valleys last; For one whom I had loved, whom I had pressed With honest, ardent passion to my breast, Was to another vowed: I heard the tale, And to the earth sank heartless, faint, and pale. Till that sad hour when every hope had flown, I thought she lived for me, and me alone; Yet did I not, though pangs my heart must rend, Prove to thy weakness a sustaining friend? Did I not bid thee, never, never more Or think of me or mine? As firm I swore To cast away the dream, and bury deep, As in oblivion of the dead man's sleep, All that once soothed, and from the soul to tear Each longing wish that youth had cherished there. But when 'twas midnight, to the woods I hied, Despairing, and with frantic anguish cried: Oh, had relentless death with instant dart Smitten and snatched thee from my bleeding heart; Through life had niggard fortune bid us pine, And withered with despair thy hopes and mine; Yes, yes, I could have borne it; but to see The accusing tear, and know it falls for me; Oh cease the thought—a long and last farewell— We must forget—nor shall my soul rebel! Then to my country's cliffs I bade adieu, And what my sad heart felt God only knew. Helvetia, thy rude scenes, a drooping guest, I sought, and sorrowing sought a spot of rest. Through many a mountain pass and shaggy vale I roamed an exile, passion-crazed and pale. I saw your clouded heights sublime impend, I heard your foaming cataracts descend; And oft the rugged scene my heart endued With a strange, sad, distempered fortitude; Oft on the lake's green marge I lay reclined, Murmuring my moody fancies to the wind; But when some hanging hamlet I surveyed, A wood-cot peeping in the sheltered glade, A tear, perforce, would steal; and, as my eye Fondly reverted to the days gone by, How blest, I cried, remote from every care, To rest with her we loved, forgotten there! Then soft, methought, from the sequestered grove, I heard the song of happiness and love: Come to these scenes of peace, Where, to rivers murmuring, The sweet birds all the summer sing, Where cares, and toil, and sadness cease! Stranger, does thy heart deplore Friends whom thou wilt see no more; Does thy wounded spirit prove Pangs of hopeless, severed love? Thee the stream that gushes clear, Thee the birds that carol near, Shall soothe, as silent thou dost lie, And dream of their wild lullaby; Come to bless these scenes of peace, Where cares, and toil, and sadness cease! Start from the feeble dream! The woodland shed Flames, and the tenants of that vale are dead! All dark the torrent of their fate hath rushed; Each cheering echo of the plain is hushed; And every joyous, every tender sound, In the loud roaring of the night-storm drowned. How cheerily the rocks, from side to side, Oft to the tabor's festive sounds replied! There, when the bells upon a holiday Rang out, and all the villagers were gay, In summer-time, the happy groups were seen; Youth linked with beauty bounded on the green, And age sat smiling, as the joyous train Round the tall May-pole, tapering from the plain, Their locks entwined with ribands streaming red, And crowned with flowers, the rural pastimes led. Oh! on the bleeding turf the sad flowers throw, And weep for them that sleep in dust below; There sleep together, in their deathbed cold, The beautiful, the brave, the young, the old! No voice is heard that charmed their earthly road: Around their desolate and last abode The blast that swept them to the earth yet raves, And strews with havoc their insulted graves. As on the lucid lake's unruffled breast Soft silvery lights and blending shadows rest, Above, around the heavens' blue calm is spread, And sleeps the sunshine on the mountain's head; Then purple rocks and woods smile to the eye, Like fairy landscapes of the evening sky; And all is sad, save where some forest bird, With small and solitary trill, is heard. Sudden the scene is changed, the hurricane Is up among the mountains, wind and rain Drive, and strange darkness closes on the vale; And high rocks to the lightning glimmer pale; And nought is heard but the deep thunder's roar, Or vultures screaming round the desert shore. So mourns the prospect, changed and overcast, And shrieks the spirit in the passing blast! But ah! how feller burst the ruthless storm That speeds the moral prospect to deform! To-morrow, and the man of blood may see Again fresh verdure deck the dripping tree; Again pure splendour light yon bursting views, And the clear lake reflect the fairest hues; Whilst the gay lark seems, with a livelier voice, In scorn of his stern spirit, to rejoice. But, hapless land, what dayspring shall restore The lovelier morals that now smile no more! Affection tender as the murmuring dove, That in the noiseless wood her home-nest wove; And piety, that the blue mountains trod, With kindling eyes upraised to nature's God; Virtues that made thy streams, and woods, and hills, Thy lakes all sunshine, and thy shaded rills Like pictures of no earthly paradise, Beaming remote from sorrow and from vice. Far from the earthly scenes that wasteful lie, Virtue and peace, and arts and freedom fly; Arts which the wild surrounding views inspired, And freedom, such as genuine patriots fired. When the great sun sinks in the crimson west, And all the pines in golden pomp are dressed, Whose daring hand shall snatch the vivid light, That purples o'er the promontory's height; And with a Loutherbourg's rich pencil throw On the warm tablet all the lucid glow? When the slow convent's bell sound from afar, And the dim lake reflects the evening star; When shall again the rapt enthusiast rove And deck the visionary bower of love? Hushed be the Doric strain, that, in the shade Of his own pines, the pensive Gesner played; Which oft the homeward-plodding woodman, near, Paused with his gray beard on his staff to hear; Whilst his lean dog, whose opening lips disclose, Just peeping forth, his white teeth's even rows, Lifted his long ears with sagacious heed, And fixed his full eye on his trilling reed! High on the broad Alps' solitary van, Where not a sound is heard of busy man, Hark! with loud orgies, o'er the bloody dew, Lewd Comus leads his nightly madding crew! Strong shouts and clangours through the high wood run, And distant arms flash to the sinking sun; Dark forests their lone empire, the tall rocks Their shelter, and their wealth their wandering flocks. To the proud Macedon, whose conquering car Rolled terrible through the ranks of armed war; Whose banners chilled the plain with fearful shade; Whose sovereignty a thousand trumpets brayed, The Scythian chiefs spoke nobly: What have we, King of the world, to do with thine or thee? Far o'er the snowy solitudes we roam, Or by wild rivers fix our casual home. O'er the green champagne let thy cities shine; We ne'er invaded fields or seats of thine; Nor will we bow, proud lord, at thy decree; Hence, hence, and leave us to our forests free! But the stern soldier, with war's banners spread, Through thy still vales his glittering squadrons led; And wild despair, and unrelenting hate, Stalk o'er thine inmost valleys desolate; And she, that like the nimble mountain roe, With step scarce heard, went bounding o'er the snow; She whose green buskins swept the frosts of morn, Who walked the high wood with her bugle horn; She who once called these hills her own, and found Her loveliest sojourn 'mid the hallowed ground, Blessing the spot where, shaded with high wood, And decked with simple flowers, her altar stood; Freedom insulted sees, as pale she flies, A monster phantom in her name arise! On weltering carcases it seems to stand, Waving a dim-seen dagger in its hand; Its look is unrelenting as the grave, Around its brow the muttering whirlwinds rave; Its spreading shadow chills the scene beneath, Ah! fly—it onward moves, and murmurs, Death! Earth fades beneath its footstep, and around Long sighs and distant dying shrieks resound! Could arms alone o'er thy brave sons prevail, Helvetia? No, it was the fraudful tale Of this false phantom which the heart misled; That spoke of peace, peace to the poor man's shed, Then left him, houseless, to the tempest's gloom That swept his hopes and comforts to the tomb! High towered the grisly spectre, half concealed, And gathering clouds its dismal forests veiled; The clouds disperse, and lo! 'mid murderous bands, Dark in its might the hideous phantom stands! Now see the triumph of its reign complete! Behold it throned in its own sovereign seat! The orgies peal, the banners wave on high, And dark rocks ring to shouts of liberty! Now, soldier, lift thy loud acclaiming voice! Children of high-souled sentiment, rejoice! Round the scathed tree, upon the desert plain, Dance o'er the victims of the village slain! Thou who dost smiling sit, as fancy flings Her hues unreal o'er created things, And as the scenes in gay distemper shine, Dost wondering cry, How sweet a world is mine! Ah! see the shades, receding, that disclose The direst spectacle of living woes! And ye who, all enlightened, all sublime, Pant in indignant thraldom till the time When man, bursting his fetters, proud and free, The wildest savage of the wilds shall be; Artful instructors of our feeble kind, Illumined leaders of the lost and blind, Behold the destined glories of your reign! Behold yon flaming sheds, yon outcast train! Hark! hollow moaning on the fitful blast, Methought, Rousseau, thy troubled spirit passed; His ravaged country his dim eyes survey: Are these the fruits, he said, or seemed to say, Of those high energies of raptured thought, That proud philosophy my precepts taught? Then shrouding his sad visage from the sight, Flew o'er the cloud-dressed Alps to solitude and night. Thou too, whilst pondering History's vast plan, Didst sit by the clear waters of Lausanne, (What time Imperial Rome rose to thy view, And thy bold hand her mighty image drew), Thou too, methinks, as the sad wrecks extend, Dost seem in sorrow o'er the scene to bend. With steady eye and penetrating mind, Thou hast surveyed the toil of human kind; Hast marked Ambition's march and fiery car, And thousands shouting in the fields of war. But direr woes might ne'er a sigh demand, Than those of hapless, injured Switzerland! Oh, may they teach, whatever feelings start, One awful truth, that here we know in part: Whatever darkness round his ark may rest, There is a God, who knows what is is best. Submissive, still adoring may we stand Beneath the terrors of his chastening hand! And though the clouds of carnage dim the sun, Bend to the earth and say, Thy will be done! Donhead, 1801. THE VILLAGER'S VERSE-BOOK. PATH OF LIFE. 1 O Lord, in sickness and in health, To every lot resigned, Grant me, before all worldly wealth, A meek and thankful mind! 2 As, life, thy upland path we tread, And often pause in vain, To think of friends and parents dead, Oh, let us not complain! 3 The Lord may give or take away, But nought our faith can move, Whilst we to heaven can look and say, Our Father lives above. SUNRISE. 1 When from my humble bed I rise, And see the morning sun, That, glorious in the eastern skies, Its journey has begun, 2 I think of the Almighty Power Which called this orb from night; I think how many at this hour Rejoice beneath its light. 3 And then I pray, in every land, Where'er this light is shed, That all who live may bless the Hand Which gives their daily bread. SUMMER'S EVENING. 1 As homeward by the evening star I pass along the plain, I see the taper's light afar, Shine through our cottage pane. 2 My brothers and my sisters dear, The child upon the knee, Spring when my hastening steps they hear, And smile to welcome me. 3 But when the fire is growing dim, And mother's labours cease, I fold my hands, repeat my hymn, And lay me down in peace. SPRING—CUCKOO. 1 The bee is humming in the sun, The yellow cowslip springs, And, hark! from yonder woodland's side Again the cuckoo sings! 2 Cuckoo, cuckoo, no other note She sings from day to day; But I, though a poor cottage girl, Can work, and read, and pray. 3 And whilst in knowledge I rejoice, Which heavenly truth displays, Oh! let me still employ my voice In my Redeemer's praise. SHEEPFOLD. 1 The sheep were in the fold at night, And now a new-born lamb Totters and trembles in the light, Or bleats beside its dam. 2 How anxiously the mother tries, With every tender care, To screen it from inclement skies, And the cold morning air! 3 The hailstorm of the east is fled, She seems with joy to swell, Whilst ever as she bends her head, I hear the tinkling bell. 4 So while for me a mother's prayer Ascends to heaven above, May I repay her tender care With gratitude and love! HEN AND CHICKENS. 1 See, sister, where the chickens trip, All busy in the morn! Look how their heads they dip and dip, To peck the scattered corn! 2 Dear sister, shall we shut our eyes, And to the sight be blind, Nor think of Him who food supplies To us and all mankind? 3 Whether our wants be much or few, Or fine or coarse our fare, To Heaven's protecting care is due The voice of praise and prayer. POOR MAN'S GRAVE. 1 Old Andrews of the hut is dead, And many a child appears, Whilst slowly “dust to dust” is read, Around his grave in tears. 2 A good man gone where small and great, And poor, and high and low, And Dives, proud in worldly state, And Lazarus, must go. 3 May we among the just be found, Though short our sojourn here, Who, when the trump of death shall sound, May hear it without fear! SABBATH MORNING. 1 The Sabbath bells are knolling slow, The summer morn how fair! Whilst father, mother, children go, And seek the house of prayer. 2 Some, musing, roam the churchyard round, Some turn their heads with sighs, And gaze upon the new-made ground Where old Giles Summers lies. 3 But see the pastor in his band, The bells have ceased to knoll; Now enter, and at God's command, Think, Christian, of thy soul. 4 Whilst heavenly hopes around thee shine, As in God's presence live, And calmer comforts shall be thine, Than all the world can give. THE PRIMROSE. 1 'Tis the first primrose! see how meek, Yet beautiful, it looks; As just a lesson it may teach As that we read in books. 2 While gardens show in flowering pride The lily's stately ranks, It loves its modest head to hide Beneath the bramble banks. 3 And so the little cottage maid May bloom unseen and die; But she, when transient flowerets fade, Shall live with Christ on high. THE HOUR-GLASS. 1 As by my mother's side I stand, Whose hairs, alas, are few and gray, I watch the hour-glass shed its sand, To mark how wears the night away. 2 Though age must many ills endure, As time for ever runs away, This shows her Christian comforts sure, And leads to heaven's eternal day. THE BIRD'S NEST. 1 In yonder brake there is a nest; But come not, George, too nigh, Lest the poor mother, frightened thence, Should leave her young, and fly! 2 Think with what pain, for many a day, Soft moss and straw she brought; And let our own dear mother's care Be present to our thought. 3 And think how must her heart deplore, And droop with grief and pain, If those she reared, and nursed, and loved, She ne'er should see again. THE MOWER. 1 Hark to the mower's whistling blade! How steadily he mows! The grass is heaped, the daisies fade, All scattered as he goes. 2 The flowers of life may bloom and fade, But He in whom I trust, Though cold and in my grave-clothes laid, Can raise me from the dust. SATURDAY NIGHT. 1 Come, let us, ere we go to bed, O'er the decaying embers chat, Though little Mary hangs her head, And strokes no more the purring cat. 2 And let us tell how prisoners pine In silent dungeons dark and drear; Whilst on each face the embers shine, And all is calm and peaceful here. 3 The English cot is free from cares; But, see, the brand is wasted quite; Come, little Mary, say your prayers; Kiss, mother, kiss! good night, good night! SUNDAY NIGHT. 1 Let us unfold God's holy book, And by the taper's light, With hearts subdued, and sober look, So spend the Sabbath night. 2 Where now the thoughts of anxious life, Its guilty pleasures, where? Here dies its loud and mourning strife, And all its sounds of care. 3 Let other views our hearts engross, To our Redeemer true, Who seems expiring on the cross, To say, I died for you! THE APRIL SHOWER. 1 When rain-drops, glistening from the thatch, Like drops of silver run, Our old blind grandame lifts the latch, To feel the cheering sun. 2 She sees no rainbow in the sky, But when the cuckoo sung, She thought upon the years gone by, When she was blithe and young. 3 But God, who comforts want and age, Shall be her only friend, And bless her till her pilgrimage In silent dust shall end. THE ROBIN REDBREAST. 1 Poor Robin sits and sings alone When showers of driving sleet, By the cold winds of winter blown, The cottage casement beat. 2 Come, let him share our chimney nook, And dry his dripping wing; See, little Mary shuts her book, And cries, “Poor Robin, sing!” 3 Methinks I hear his faint reply: When cowslips deck the plain, The lark shall carol in the sky, And I shall sing again. 4 But in the cold and wintry day, To you I owe a debt, That in the sunshine of the May I never can forget! THE BUTTERFLY AND THE BEE. 1 Methought I heard a butterfly Say to a labouring bee, Thou hast no colours of the sky On painted wings, like me. 2 Poor child of vanity! those dyes, And colours bright and rare, With mild reproof, the bee replies, Are all beneath my care. 3 Content I toil from morn till eve, And, scorning idleness, To tribes of gawdy sloth I leave The vanities of dress. THE GLOW-WORM. 1 Oh, what is this which shines so bright, And in the lonely place Hangs out his small green lamp at night, The dewy bank to grace! 2 It is a glow-worm, still and pale It shines the whole night long, When only stars, O nightingale, Seem listening to thy song! 3 And so amid the world's cold night, Through good report or ill, Shines out the humble Christian's light, As lonely and as still. THE CONVICT. Luke Andrews is transported! Never more To see his sisters, mother, or the shore Of his own country! Never more to see The cottage smoke rise o'er the sheltering tree; Never again beneath the morning beam, Jocund, to drive afield his tinkling team! When first the path of idleness he trod, And left on Sabbath-days the house of God, The fellowship of wild companions kept, How oft at night his mother waked and wept! When he is homeless, and far off at sea, She now will sigh, Does he remember me! Remember her! alas, the thought is vain! She ne'er will see him in this world again. And she is broken-hearted; but her trust, Is still in Him whose works and ways are just. Oh! may we still revere His dread command, And die remembered in our native land! THE BLIND GRANDFATHER. 1 Though grandfather has long been blind, And his few locks are gray, He loves to hear the summer wind Round his pale temples play. 2 We'll lead him to some quiet place, Some unfrequented nook, Where winds breathe soft, and wild-flowers grace The borders of the brook. 3 There he shall sit, as in a dream, Though nought can he behold, Till the brook's murmuring flow shall seem The voice of friends of old. 4 Think no more of them, aged man, For here thou hast no friend; Think, since this life is but a span, Of joys that have no end. THE OLD LABOURER. 1 Are you not tired, you poor old man! The drops are on your brow; Your labour with the sun began, And you are labouring now! 2 I murmur not to dig the soil, For I have heard it read, That man by industry and toil Must eat his daily bread. 3 The lark awakes me with his song, That hails the morning gray, And when I mourn for human wrong, I think of God, and pray. 4 Let worldlings waste their time and health, And try each vain delight; They cannot buy, with all their wealth, The labourer's rest at night. THE SWAN. 1 Look at the swan! how still he goes! His neck and breast like silver gleam; He seems majestic as he rows; The glory of the lonely stream. 2 There is a glory in the war, A glory when the warrior wears (His visage marked with many a scar) The laurel wet with human tears. 3 Such scenes no glory can impart, With trumps, and drums, and noises rude, Like that which fills his silent heart Who walks with God in quietude. THE VILLAGE BELLS. 1 Who does not love the village bells, Their cheerful peal, and solemn toll! One of the rustic wedding tells, And one bespeaks a parting soul. 2 The lark in sunshine sings his song, And, dressed in garments white and gay, The village lasses trip along, For this is Susan's wedding-day. 3 Ah! gather flowers of sweetest hue, Young violets from the bank's green side, And on poor Mary's coffin strew, For in the bloom of life she died. 4 So passes life! the smile, the tear, Succeed, as in our path we stray, Thy kingdom come, for we are here As guests who tarry but a day. THE CAGED BIRD. Oh, who would keep a little bird confined, When cowslip bells are nodding in the wind; When every hedge as with “good morrow” rings, And, heard from wood to coombe, the blackbird sings! Oh! who would keep a little bird confined In his cold wiry prison? Let him fly, And hear him sing: How sweet is liberty! THE DUTIFUL CHILD READING THE STORY OF JOSEPH TO A SICK FATHER. Brother and sister are a-Maying gone; By my sick father's bed I watch alone; Light in the sun, from field to field they roam, To bring a cowslip-ball or May-thorn home; I sit and read of Joseph, in the land Of Egypt, when his guilty brothers stand Before him—but they know him not; aside He turns his face, the bursting tears to hide: Scarce to these words an utterance can he give; I am your brother Joseph! Doth he live, My father, the old man of whom ye speak? And tears are falling on my father's cheek. Though my loved mother rests among the dead, And pain and sickness visit this sad bed, We think not, whilst we turn the holy page, Of this vain world—of sorrow and of age! And oh, my father, I am blessed indeed, Blessed for your sake, that I have learned to read! LITTLE MARY'S LINNET. 1 Dear Mary, if thy little bird Should, all the winter long, Pleased from the window to be heard, Repay thee with a song; 2 A lesson let it still convey To all with sense endued; And such the voice, oh! let it say, The still small voice of love. THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG. 1 My dog and I are both grown old; On these wild downs we watch all day; He looks in my face when the wind blows cold, And thus methinks I hear him say: 2 The gray stone circlet is below, The village smoke is at our feet; We nothing hear but the sailing crow, And wandering flocks, that roam and bleat. 3 Far off, the early horseman hies, In shower or sunshine rushing on; Yonder the dusty whirlwind flies; The distant coach is seen and gone. 4 Though solitude around is spread, Master, alone thou shalt not be; And when the turf is on thy head, I only shall remember thee! 5 I marked his look of faithful care, I placed my hand on his shaggy side; There is a sun that shines above, A sun that shines on both, I cried. THE WITHERED LEAF. 1 Oh! mark the withered leaves that fall In silence to the ground; Upon the human heart they call, And preach without a sound. 2 They say, So passes man's brief year! To-day, his green leaves wave; To-morrow, changed by time, and sere, He drops into the grave. 3 Let Wisdom be our sole concern, Since life's green days are brief! And faith and heavenly hope shall learn A lesson from the leaf. THE GIPSY'S TENT. 1 When now cold winter's snows are fled, And birds sing blithe again, Look where the gipsy's tent is spread, In the green village lane. 2 Oft by the old park pales, beneath The branches of the oak, The watchdog barks, when, in slow wreath, Curls o'er the woods the smoke. 3 No home receives the wandering race; The panniered ass is nigh, Which patient bears from place to place Their infant progeny. 4 Lo! houseless o'er the the world they stray, But I at home will dwell, Where I may read my book and pray, And hear the Sabbath-bell. MY FATHER'S GRAVE. 1 My father's grave, I heard her say, And marked a stealing tear; Oh, no! I would not go away, My father's grave is here! 2 A thousand thronging sympathies The lonely spot endear, And every eve remembrance sighs, My father's grave is here! 3 Some sudden tears unbidden start, As spring's gay birds I hear, For all things whisper to my heart, My father's grave is here! 4 Young hope may blend each colour gay, And fairer views appear; But, no! I will not go away, My father's grave is here! THE SWALLOW AND THE RED-BREAST. AN APOLOGUE. The swallows, at the close of day, When autumn shone with fainter ray, Around the chimney circling flew, Ere yet they bade a long adieu, To climes where soon the winter drear Shall close the unrejoicing year. Now with swift wing they skim aloof, Now settle on the crowded roof, As counsel and advice to take, Ere they the chilly north forsake. Then one, disdainful, turned his eye, Upon a red-breast twittering nigh, And thus began, with taunting scorn: Thou household imp, obscure, forlorn, Through the deep winter's dreary day, Here, dull and shivering, shalt thou stay; Whilst we, who make the world our home, To softer climes impatient roam, Where summer, still on some green isle Rests, with her sweet and lovely smile? Thus speeding, far and far away, We leave behind the shortening day. 'Tis true (the red-breast answered, meek) No other scenes I ask, or seek; To every change alike resigned, I fear not the cold winter's wind. When spring returns, the circling year Shall find me still contented here; But whilst my warm affections rest Within the circle of my nest, I learn to pity those that roam, And love the more my humble home. THE BLIND MAN OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL. There is a poor blind man, who, every day, In summer sunshine, or in winter's rain, Duly as tolls the bell, to the high fane Explores, with faltering footsteps, his dark way, To kneel before his Maker, and to hear The chaunted service, pealing full and clear. Ask why alone in the same spot he kneels Through the long year. Oh, the wide world is cold, As dark, to him! Here he no longer feels His sad bereavement. Faith and Hope uphold His heart; he feels not he is poor and blind, Amid the unpitying tumult of his mind. As through the aisles the choral anthems roll, His soul is in the choirs above the skies, And songs far off of angel companies, When this dim earth hath perished like a scroll. Oh! happy if the rich, the vain, the proud— The plumed actors in life's motley crowd— Since pride is dust, and life itself a span, Would learn one lesson from a poor blind man! THE BLIND SOLDIER AND HIS DAUGHTER. 1 Old soldier! old soldier! the beams of the day, That shone on thy sabre, have long passed away, And thy sun is gone down, and thy few hairs are gray, Old soldier! 2 The drum and the hurrahs, where victory led, No longer are heard on the battle-field red; Thy comrades in glory are scattered or dead, Old soldier! 2 Perhaps thou wert foremost of some gallant band, By Acre's white walls, or in that ancient land Where the sphynx and gray pyramid shaded the sand, Old soldier! 3 Left lonely and poor, but to fortune resigned, Forgetting the trumpet that clanged in the wind, Thou turnest thy organ unnoticed and blind, Old soldier! 4 That faded red jacket still speaks of some pride, And a dutiful daughter is seen at thy side, To beat her light drum, and thy footsteps to guide, Old soldier! 5 Ah! woe to the heart that would seek to betray, Or turn from a desolate father away, That dutiful child, of thy age the last stay, Old soldier! 6 But may every true Briton, whose country is dear, Bestow a small boon, now the season is drear, Thy warm chimney corner at Christmas to cheer, Old soldier! 7 Then the thought of the days of past glory shall spring, And wiping one tear from thy cheek, thou shalt sing, Old England for ever, and God save the King! Old soldier! THE LITTLE SWEEP. WRITTEN FOR JAMES MONTGOMERY'S CHIMNEY-SWEEPER'S ALBUM. 1 They sing of the poor sailor-boy, who wanders o'er the deep, But few there are who think upon the friendless little sweep! In darkness to his dreary toil, through winter's frost and snows, When the keen north wind is piping shrill, the shivering urchin goes. 2 He has no father; and from grief, his mother's eyes are dim, And none beside, in all the world, awakes to pray for him; For him no summer Sundays smile, no health is in the breeze; His mind is dark as his face, a prey to dire disease. 3 O English gentlemen! your hearts have bled for the black slave,— You heard his melancholy moan from the Atlantic wave; He thought upon his father's land, and cried, A long farewell, But blessed you, gazing at the sun, when first his fetters fell. 4 And if ye plead for creatures dumb, and deem their fate severe, Shall human wrongs, in your own land, call forth no generous tear? Humanity implores; awake from apathy's cold sleep, And when you plead for others' wrongs, forget not the poor sweep. 5 When summer comes, the bells shall ring, and flowers and hawthorns blow, The village lasses and the lads shall all a-Maying go: Kind-hearted lady, may thy soul in heaven a blessing reap, Whose bounty at that season flows, to cheer the little sweep. 6 'Tis yours, ye English gentlemen, such comforts to prolong; 'Tis yours the friendless to protect, and all who suffer wrong; But one day in the toiling year the friendless sweep is gay, Protect, and smiling industry shall make his long year May. THE BLACKSMITH. 1 How cheerful in the winter's night, As down the lane I stray; The blacksmith's forge shoots out its light, And shines across the way! 2 The smith his labouring bellows blows, And now his stroke repeats; Beats the red iron, as it glows, And shapes it as he beats. 3 While, flash! the frequent sparkles fly, And tongs are hissing red; Content and cheerful industry Sweeten his daily bread. HYMN FOR THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE. 1 Lo! where youth and beauty lie, Cold within the tomb! As the spring's first violets die, Withered in their bloom. O'er the young and buried bride, Let the cypress wave: A kingdom's hope, a kingdom's pride, Recline in yonder grave. 2 Place the vain expected child, Gently, near her breast! It never wept, it never smiled, But seeks its mother's rest. Hark! we hear the general cry! Hark! the passing bell! A thousand, thousand bosoms sigh, A long and last farewell! THE CHILDREN'S HYMN FOR THEIR PATRONESS. 1 On God, whose eyes are over all, Who shows to all a father's care, First, with each voice, we children call, And humbly raise our daily prayer. 2 And next, to her, who placed us here, The path of knowledge to pursue, (Oh! witness all we have—a tear!) Our heartfelt gratitude is due. 3 Our parents, when they draw their breath, In pain, and to the grave descend, Shall smile upon the bed of death, To think their children have a friend. 4 As slow our infant thoughts expand, And life unfolds its opening road, We still shall bless the bounteous hand That kind protection first bestowed. 5 And still, with fervour we shall pray, When she to distant scenes shall go; That God, in blessing, might repay The blessings which to her we owe! EASTER DAY. 1 Who comes (my soul no longer doubt), Rising from earth's wormy sod, And whilst ten thousand angels sing, Ascends—ascends to heaven, a God? 2 Saviour, Lord, I know thee now! Mighty to redeem and save, Such glory blazes on thy brow, Which lights the darkness of the grave. 3 Saviour, Lord, the human soul, Forgotten every sorrow here, Shall thus, aspiring to its goal, Triumph in its native sphere. CHRISTMAS HYMN. 1 Hark! angel voices from the sky Proclaim a Saviour's birth; Glory, they sing, to God on high, Peace and goodwill on earth! 2 Catch the glad strain, ye seraphs bright! The glorious tidings spread; Wake, wake to wonder and to light, The dark sleep of the dead! 3 Let the wide earth, from shore to shore, One loud hosannah raise, Glory to God, whom we adore; Glory and hymns of praise! SONG OF THE CID. 1 The Cid is sitting, in martial state, Within Valencia's wall; And chiefs of high renown attend The knightly festival. 2 Brave Alvar Fanez, and a troop Of gallant men, were there; And there came Donna Ximena, His wife and daughters fair. 3 When the footpage bent on his knee, What tidings brought he then? Morocco's king is on the seas, With fifty thousand men. 4 Now God be praised! the Cid he cried, Let every hold be stored: Let fly the holy Gonfalon, And give, “St James,” the word. 5 And now, upon the turret high, Was heard the signal drum; And loud the watchman blew his trump, And cried, They come! they come! 6 The Cid then raised his sword on high, And by God's Mother swore, These walls, hard-gotten, he would keep, Or bathe their base in gore. 7 My wife, my daughter, what, in tears! Nay, hang not thus your head; For you shall see how well we fight; How soldiers earn their bread. 8 We will go out against the Moors, And crush them in your sight; And all the Christians shouted loud, May God defend the right! 9 He took his wife and daughter's hand, So resolute was he, And led them to the highest tower That overlooks the sea. 10 They saw how vast a pagan power Came sailing o'er the brine; They saw, beneath the morning light, The Moorish crescents shine. 11 These ladies then grew deadly pale, As heart-struck with dismay; And when they heard the tambours beat, They turned their heads away. 12 The thronged streamers glittering flew, The sun was shining bright, Now cheer, the valiant Cid he cried, This is a glorious sight! 13 Whilst thus, with shuddering look aghast, These fearful ladies stood, The Cid, he raised his sword, and cried, All this is for your good: 14 Ere fifteen days are gone and past, If God assist the right, Those tambours that now sound to scare, Shall sound for your delight. 15 The Moors who pressed beneath the towers, Now Allah! Allah! sung; Each Christian knight his broadsword drew, And loud the trumpets rung. 16 Then up, the noble Cid bespoke, Let each brave warrior go, And arm himself, in dusk of morn, Ere chanticleer shall crow; 17 And in the lofty minster church, On Santiago call,— That good Bishop Hieronymo, Shall there absolve you all. 18 But let us prudent counsel take, In this eventful hour; For yon proud infidels, I ween, They are a mighty power. 19 Then Alvar Fanez counselled well, I, noble Cid, will go, And ambush with three hundred men, Ere the first cock doth crow: 20 And when against the Moorish men You, Cid, lead on your powers, We, dauntless, on the other side Will fall on them with ours. 21 This counsel pleased the Cheftain well: He said, it should be so; And the good Bishop should sing mass, Ere the first cock did crow. 22 The day is gone, the night is come; At cock-crow all appear, In Pedro's church to shrive themselves, And holy mass to hear: 23 On Santiago there they called, To hear them and to save; And that good Bishop, at the mass, Great absolution gave. 24 Fear not, he cried, when thousands bleed, When horse on man shall roll! Whoever dies, I take his sins, And God be with his soul. 25 A boon! a boon! the Bishop cried, I have sung mass to-day; Let me the brunt of battle bear, Cid, in the bloody fray. 26 Now Alvar Fanez and his men Had gained the thicket's shade; And, with hushed breath and anxious eye, Had there their ambush laid. 27 Four thousand men, in glittering arms, All issued from the gate; Whilst the bold Cid, before them all, On Bavieca sate. 28 They passed the ambush on the left, And marched o'er dale and down, Till soon they got the Moorish camp Betwixt them and the town. 29 The Cid then spurred his horse, and set The battle in array. Pero Bermudez proudly bore His standard on that day. 30 When this the Moors astonied saw, Allah! began their cry: The tambours beat, the cymbals rung, As they would rend the sky. 31 Banner, advance! the Cid he cried, And raised aloft his sword: And all the host set up the shout, St Mary and our Lord! 32 That good Bishop Hieronymo, Bravely his battle bore; And shouted, as he spurred his steed, For bold Campeador! 33 The Moorish and the Christian host Now mix their dying cries; And many a horse along the plain, Without his rider flies. 34 Now sinks the Crescent, now the Cross, As the fierce hosts assail; But what against o'erwhelming might Can valour's self avail? 35 Campeador, all bathed in blood, Spurred on his horse amain; And, Santiago! cried aloud, For Bivar and for Spain! 36 Now Alvar Fanez and his men, Who crouched in thickets low, Leaped up, and, with the lightning glance, Rushed, shouting, on the foe. 37 The Moors, who saw their pennons gay All waving in the wind, Fled in dismay, for still they feared, A greater host behind. 38 The Crescent falls. Pursue! pursue! Haste—spur along the plain! See where they sink—see where they lie, The fainting and the slain! 39 Of fifty thousand, who at morn Came forth in armour bright, Scarce fifteen thousand souls were left, To tell the tale at night. 40 The Cid then wiped his bloody brow, And thus was heard to say: Well, Bavieca, hast thou sped, My noble horse, to-day! 41 If thousands then escaped the sword, Let none the Cid condemn; For they were swept into the sea, And the surge went over them. 42 There's many a maid of Tetuan, All day shall sit and weep, But never see her lover's sail Shine on the northern deep. 43 There's many a mother, with her babe, Shall pace the sounding shore, And think upon its father's smile, Whom she shall see no more. 44 Rock, hoary ocean, mournfully, Upon thy billowy bed; For, dark and deep, thy surges sweep, O'er thousands of the dead. POEMS, INEDITED, UNPUBLISHED, ETC. THE SANCTUARY: A DRAMATIC SKETCH. In this wise the Duke of Gloucester took upon himself the order and governance of the young King, whom, with much honour and humble reverence, he conveyed towards London. But the tidings of this matter came hastily to the Queen, a little before the midnight following; and that, in secret wise, her son was taken, her brother and other friends arrested, and sent no man wist whither, to be done with God wot what. With which tidings the Queen, with great heaviness, bewailed her child's reign, her friend's mischance, and her own misfortune, damning the time that ever she dissuaded the gathering of powers about the King; got herself, in all haste possible, with her young son and her daughter, out of the palace of Westminster, in which they then lay, into the Sanctuary; lodging herself and company there in the Abbott's place. —Speed's “History of England,” book ix. Scene I. Elizabeth, widow of Edward IV., in the palace of Westminster, watching her youngest son, Richard, sleeping. Eliz. The minster-clock tolls midnight; I have watched Night after night, and heard the same sad sound Knolling; the same sad sound, night after night; As if, amid the world's deep silence, Time, Pausing a moment in his onward flight, From yonder solitary, moonlit pile, More awful spoke, as with a voice from heaven, Of days and hours departed, and of those That “are not;” till, like dreams of yesterday, The very echo dies! Oh, my poor child! Thou hast been long asleep; by the pale lamp I sit and watch thy slumbers; thy calm lids Are closed; thy lips just parted; one hand lies Upon thy breast, that scarce is seen to heave Beneath it; and thy breath so still is drawn, Save to a sleepless mother's listening ear, It were inaudible; and, see! a smile Seems even now lighting on thy lip, dear boy, As thou wert dreaming of delightful things In some celestial region of sweet sounds, Or summer fields, and skies without a cloud; (Ah! how unlike this dark and troubled world!) Let not one kiss awaken thee, one kiss, Mingled with tears and prayer to God in heaven. So dream; and never, never may those eyes Awake suffused with tears, as mine are now, To think that life's best hopes are such a dream! Now sleeps the city through its vast extent, That, restless as the ocean-waves, at morn, With its ten thousand voices shall awake, Lifting the murmur of its multitude To heaven's still gate! Now all is hushed as death; None are awake, save those who wake to weep, Like me; save those who meditate revenge, Or beckon muttering Murder. God of heaven! From the hyena panting for their blood, Oh save my youthful Edward! and, poor child! Preserve thy innocence to happier hours. Hark! There is knocking at the western gate. A messenger enters, and announces to her that her brother had been arrested on the road, by the Duke of Glo'ster. Eliz. O my poor child, thou sleepest now in peace! Wilt thou sleep thus another year? shall I Hang o'er thee with a mother's look of love, Thus bend beside thy bed, thus part the hair Upon thy forehead, and thus kiss thy cheek? Richard, awake! the tiger is abroad. We must to sanctuary instantly. Richard awaking. Rich. Oh! I have had the sweetest dreams, dear mother! Methought my brother Edward and myself And— Eliz. Come, these are no times to talk of dreams; We must to sanctuary, my poor boy; We'll talk of dreams hereafter. Kneel with me. Takes him from his couch, and kisses him. Rich. Mother, why do you weep and tremble so? Eliz. I have a pain at heart! Come, stir thee, boy! Lift up thy innocent hands to Heaven; here kneel And pray with me before this crucifix. Her daughters enter, and they all kneel together. Scene II. The Sanctuary at Westminster. Rich. O my dear mother! why do we sit here, Amid these dusky walls and arches dim, When it is summer in the fields without, And sunshine? Say, is not my brother king, Why will he not come here to play with me; Shall I not see my brother? Eliz. My own child, Oh! let me hide these tears upon thy head! Thy brother, shalt thou see him? Yes, I hope. Come, I will tell a tale:—There was a boy Who had a cruel uncle— Rich. I have heard My uncle Glo'ster was a cruel man; But he was always kind to me, and said That I should be a king, if Edward died; I'd rather be a bird to fly away, Or sing— Eliz. The serpent's eye of fire, With slow and deadly glare, poor bird, I fear, Is fixed on thee and Edward—God avert it! Rich. And therefore must not I go out to play? Eliz. Go, play among the tombs—I will go too; Go, play with skulls and bones; or see the train Of sceptred kings come slowly through the gloom, And widowed queens move in the shroud of death Along the glimmering aisles and hollow vaults. Would I were with them—I shall be so soon! Rich. Mother, methought I saw him yesterday— Eliz. Saw whom? Rich. My father; and he seemed to look— I cannot say how sadly. Could it be His spirit? He was armed, but very pale And sorrowful his countenance. I heard No sound of footsteps when he moved away And disappeared among the distant tombs In further darkness. Eliz. O my son, my son! Thou hadst a king thy father—he is dead; Thou hadst been happier as a peasant's child! Rich. Oh! how I wish I were a shepherd's boy, For then, dear mother! I would run and play With Edward; and we two, in primrose-time, Would wander out among the villages, Or go a-Maying by some river's side, And mark the minnow-shoals, when morning shone Upon the yellow gravel, shoot away Beneath the old gray arch, or bring home cowslips For all my sisters, for Elizabeth, And you, dear mother, if you would not weep so. Eliz. Richard, break not my heart; give me your hand, And kneel with me by this cold monument. Spirit of my loved husband, now in heaven, If, at this moment, thou dost see thy son, And me, thus broken-hearted,—oh! if aught Yet human touches thee, assist these prayers, That him, and me, and my poor family, God, in the hour of peril, may protect! Let not my heart yet break. Come, my poor boy! Scene III. The Cardinal of York—Queen—Richard. Eliz. Now, my Lord Cardinal, what is the will Of our great lords with me? Your Grace well knows I am a helpless woman, have no power; My only wish, for what of life remains, Prayer and repose, and for my poor child here Safety. Car. The Council, madam, wish no less; But, for your son, they deem his durance here Breeds ill report. This separation, too, Of those in blood allied, almost of years The same, who have been cradled in one lap, What can it say, but that one brother stands In peril of the other? And, besides, Were it not for the comfort of them both That they should be together? Sport, not care, Becomes their early years. Eliz. I say not nay; It is most fitting that my youngest son Were with the king, his brother; in good faith, I know it would be comfort to them both: But, when I think upon the tender years, Even of the eldest, I must also think A mother's custody were best for either. You have no children, else I would not ask, Is there a guardian like a mother's love? Richard, look up! This good man here intends No harm to me or you. Look up, my boy! No power on earth, nothing but death itself Shall sever us. What would you more, my Lord? Car. Madam, no man contendeth that your Grace Is not the fittest guardian of your child, And tenderest; but, if so it pleases you Here to lie hid, shut out from all the world, Be it for humour or for jealousy, We hold it meetest, that no power on earth Should so detain a brother of the King. And let me add, when reasons of the state Required the absence of your eldest son, Yourself were well content. Eliz. Not very well; Nor is the case the same; one was in health, The other here declines; and let me marvel That he, the Lord Protector of this realm, Should wish him out; for, should aught ill betide, Suspicion, in some tempers, might arise Against the keeping of his Grace. My Lord, Do they complain that my child Richard here Is with his desolate and widowed mother, Who has no other comfort? Do they claim His presence, for that here his residence Consorts not with his fortunes? I am fixed Not to come forth and jeopardy his life. Car. Jeopardy! Where, and how;—why should, indeed, Your friends have any fears? Can you say why? Eliz. Truly; nor why in prison they should be, As now they are, I know no reason why. But this I know, that they who, without colour, Have cast them into prison, if they will, Their deaths may compass with as little cause. My Lord, no more of this. Car. My gracious queen, This only let me say; if, by arrest, Your Grace's high and honourable kin Be now confined, when trial has been had, They shall do well; and for your Grace's self, There never was, nor can be, jeopardy. Eliz. Why should I trust? That I am innocent! And were they guilty? That I am more loved, Even by those enemies, who only hate Them for my sake! Therefore I will not forth, Nor shall my son.—here will we both abide. These shrines shall be the world to him and me; These monuments our sad companions; Or when, as now, the morning sunshine streams Slant from the rich-hued window's height, and rests On yonder tomb, it shall discourse to me Of the brief sunshine in the gloom of life. No, of heaven's light upon the silent grave; Of the tired traveller's eternal home; Of hope and joy beyond this vale of tears. Car. Then pardon me. We will not bandy words Further. If it shall please you, generous queen, To yield your son, I pledge my life and soul, Not only for a surety, but estate If resolutely still you answer no, We shall forthwith depart; for nevermore Will I be suitor in this business Unto your Majesty, who thus accuse, Either of want of knowledge or of truth, Those who would stake their lives on the event. Madam, farewell! Eliz. [after a pause]. Stay, let me think again. If you say sooth—and I have found you ever, My Lord, a faithful friend and counsellor— Into your hands I here resign, in trust, My dearest treasure upon earth, my son. Of you I will require him, before Heaven; Yet, for the love which his dead father bore you, For kindnesses of old, and for that trust The king, my husband, ever placed in you, Think, if a wretched mother fear too much, Oh think, and be you wary, lest you fear Too little! My poor child, here then we part! Richard! Almighty God shower on your head His blessings, when your mother is no more. Farewell, my own sweet son! Yet, ere we part, Kiss me again, God only knows, poor babe, Whether in this world we shall meet again! Nay, my boy Richard, let me dry thy tears, Or hide them in my bosom; dearest child, God's blessing rest with thee!—farewell, farewell! My heart is almost broken—oh, farewell! CHILDE HAROLD'S LAST PILGRIMAGE. So ends Childe Harold his last pilgrimage! Above the Malian surge he stood, and cried, Liberty! and the shores, from age to age Renowned, and Sparta's woods and rocks, replied, Liberty! But a spectre at his side Stood mocking, and its dart uplifting high Smote him; he sank to earth in life's fair pride: Sparta! thy rocks echoed another cry, And old Ilissus sighed, Die, generous exile, die! I will not ask sad pity to deplore His wayward errors, who thus early died; Still less, Childe Harold, now thou art no more, Will I say aught of genius misapplied; Of the past shadows of thy spleen or pride. But I will bid the Arcadian cypress wave, Pluck the green laurel from Peneus' side, And pray thy spirit may such quiet have, That not one thought unkind be murmured o'er thy grave. So ends Childe Harold his last pilgrimage! Ends in that region, in that land renowned, Whose mighty genius lives in Glory's page, And on the Muses' consecrated ground; His pale cheek fading where his brows were bound With their unfading wreath! I will not call The nymphs from Pindus' piny shades profound, But strew some flowers upon thy sable pall, And follow to the grave a Briton's funeral. Slow move the plumed hearse, the mourning train, I mark the long procession with a sigh, Silently passing to that village fane Where, Harold, thy forefathers mouldering lie; Where sleeps the mother, who with tearful eye Pondering the fortunes of thy onward road, Hung o'er the slumbers of thine infancy; Who here, released from every human load, Receives her long-lost child to the same calm abode. Bursting Death's silence, could that mother speak, When first the earth is heaped upon thy head, In thrilling, but with hollow accent weak, She thus might give the welcome of the dead: Here rest, my son, with me—the dream is fled— The motley mask and the great coil are o'er; Welcome to me, and to this wormy bed, Where deep forgetfulness succeeds the roar Of earth, and fretting passions waste the heart no more. Here rest!—on all thy wanderings peace repose, After the fever of thy toilsome way; No interruption this long silence knows; Here no vain phantoms lead the soul astray; The earth-worm feeds on his unconscious prey: Here both shall sleep in peace till earth and sea Give up their dead, at that last awful day, King, Lord, Almighty Judge! remember me; And may Heaven's mercy rest, my erring child, on thee! THE EGYPTIAN TOMB. Pomp of Egypt's elder day, Shade of the mighty passed away, Whose giant works still frown sublime 'Mid the twilight shades of Time; Fanes, of sculpture vast and rude, That strew the sandy solitude, Lo! before our startled eyes, As at a wizard's wand, ye rise, Glimmering larger through the gloom! While on the secrets of the tomb, Rapt in other times, we gaze, The Mother Queen of ancient days, Her mystic symbol in her hand, Great Iris, seems herself to stand. From mazy vaults, high-arched and dim, Hark! heard ye not Osiris' hymn? And saw ye not in order dread The long procession of the dead? Forms that the night of years concealed, As by a flash, are here revealed; Chiefs who sang the victor song; Sceptred kings,—a shadowy throng,— From slumber of three thousand years Each, as in light and life, appears, Stern as of yore! Yes, vision vast, Three thousand years have silent passed, Suns of empire risen and set, Whose story Time can ne'er forget, Time, in the morning of her pride Immense, along the Nile's green side, The City of the Sun appeared, And her gigantic image reared. As Memnon, like a trembling string When the sun, with rising ray, Streaked the lonely desert gray, Sent forth its magic murmuring, That just was heard,—then died away; So passed, O Thebes! thy morning pride! Thy glory was the sound that died! Dark city of the desolate, Once thou wert rich, and proud, and great! This busy-peopled isle was then A waste, or roamed by savage men Whose gay descendants now appear To mark thy wreck of glory here. Phantom of that city old, Whose mystic spoils I now behold, A kingdom's sepulchre, oh say, Shall Albion's own illustrious day, Thus darkly close! Her power, her fame Thus pass away, a shade, a name! The Mausoleum murmured as I spoke; A spectre seemed to rise, like towering smoke; It answered not, but pointed as it fled To the black carcase of the sightless dead. Once more I heard the sounds of earthly strife, And the streets ringing to the stir of life. CHANTREY'S SLEEPING CHILDREN. Look at those sleeping children; softly tread, Lest thou do mar their dream, and come not nigh Till their fond mother, with a kiss, shall cry, 'Tis morn, awake! awake! Ah! they are dead! Yet folded in each other's arms they lie, So still—oh, look! so still and smilingly, So breathing and so beautiful, they seem, As if to die in youth were but to dream Of spring and flowers! Of flowers? Yet nearer stand— There is a lily in one little hand, Broken, but not faded yet, As if its cup with tears were wet. So sleeps that child, not faded, though in death, And seeming still to hear her sister's breath, As when she first did lay her head to rest Gently on that sister's breast, And kissed her ere she fell asleep! The archangel's trump alone shall wake that slumber deep. Take up those flowers that fell From the dead hand, and sigh a long farewell! Your spirits rest in bliss! Yet ere with parting prayers we say, Farewell for ever to the insensate clay, Poor maid, those pale lips we will kiss! Ah! 'tis cold marble! Artist, who hast wrought This work of nature, feeling, and of thought; Thine, Chantrey, be the fame That joins to immortality thy name. For these sweet children that so sculptured rest— A sister's head upon a sister's breast— Age after age shall pass away, Nor shall their beauty fade, their forms decay. For here is no corruption; the cold worm Can never prey upon that beauteous form: This smile of death that fades not, shall engage The deep affections of each distant age! Mothers, till ruin the round world hath rent, Shall gaze with tears upon the monument! And fathers sigh, with half-suspended breath: How sweetly sleep the innocent in death! July 2, 1826. ON MISS FITZGERALD AND LORD KERRY PLANTING TWO CEDARS IN THE CHURCHYARD OF BREMHILL. Yes, Pamela, this infant tree Planted in sacred earth by thee, Shall strike its root, and pleasant grow Whilst I am mouldering dust below. This churchyard turf shall still be green, When other pastors here are seen, Who, gazing on that dial gray, Shall mourn, like me, life's passing ray. What says its monitory shade? Thyself so blooming, now shalt fade; And even that fair and lightsome boy, Elastic as the step of joy, The future lord of yon domain, And all this wide extended plain, Shall yield to creeping time, when they Who loved him shall have passed away. Yet, planted by his youthful hand, The fellow-cedar still shall stand, And when it spreads its boughs around, Shading the consecrated ground, He may behold its shade, and say (Himself then haply growing gray), Yes, I remember, aged tree, When I was young who planted thee! But long may time, blithe maiden, spare Thy beaming eyes and crisped hair, Thy unaffected converse kind, Thy gentle and ingenuous mind. For him when I in dust repose, May virtue guide him as he grows; And may he, when no longer young, Resemble those from whom he sprung! Then let these trees extend their shade, Or live or die, or bloom or fade, Virtue, uninjured and sublime, Shall lift her brightest wreath, untouched by time. THE GREENWICH PENSIONERS. When evening listened to the dipping oar, Forgetting the loud city's ceaseless roar, By the green banks, where Thames, with conscious pride, Reflects that stately structure on his side, Within whose walls, as their long labours close, The wanderers of the ocean find repose, We wore, in social ease, the hours away, The passing visit of a summer's day. Whilst some to range the breezy hill are gone, I lingered on the river's marge alone, Mingled with groups of ancient sailors gray, And watched the last bright sunshine steal away. As thus I mused amidst the various train Of toil-worn wanderers of the perilous main, Two sailors,—well I marked them, as the beam Of parting day yet lingered on the stream, And the sun sank behind the shady reach,— Hastened with tottering footsteps to the beach. The one had lost a limb in Nile's dread fight; Total eclipse had veiled the other's sight, For ever. As I drew, more anxious, near, I stood intent, if they should speak, to hear; But neither said a word. He who was blind, Stood as to feel the comfortable wind, That gently lifted his gray hair—his face Seemed then of a faint smile to wear the trace. The other fixed his gaze upon the light, Parting, and when the sun had vanished quite, Methought a starting tear that Heaven might bless, Unfelt, or felt with transient tenderness, Came to his aged eyes, and touched his cheek! And then, as meek and silent as before, Back, hand in hand, they went, and left the shore. As they departed through the unheeding crowd, A caged bird sang from the casement loud, And then I heard alone that blind man say, The music of the bird is sweet to-day! I said, O heavenly Father! none may know The cause these have for silence or for woe! Here they appeared heartstricken and resigned Amidst the unheeding tumult of mankind. There is a world, a pure unclouded clime, Where there is neither grief, nor death, nor time, Nor loss of friends! Perhaps when yonder bell Pealed slow, and bade the dying day farewell, Ere yet the glimmering landscape sank to night, They thought upon that world of distant light! And when the blind man, lifting light his hair, Felt the faint wind, he raised a warmer prayer; Then sighed, as the blithe bird sang o'er his head, No morn shall shine on me till I am dead! GLASTONBURY ABBEY AND WELLS CATHEDRAL. WRITTEN AFTER VIEWING THE RUINS OF THE ONE, AND HEARING THE CHURCH SERVICE IN THE OTHER. Glory and boast of Avalon's fair vale, How beautiful thy ancient turrets rose! Fancy yet sees them, in the sunshine pale, Gleaming, or, more majestic, in repose, When, west-away, the crimson landscape glows, Casting their shadows on the waters wide. How sweet the sounds, that, at still day-light's close, Came blended with the airs of eventide, When through the glimmering aisle faint “Misereres” died! But all is silent now! silent the bell, That, heard from yonder ivied turret high, Warned the cowled brother from his midnight cell; Silent the vesper-chant, the litany Responsive to the organ!—scattered lie The wrecks of the proud pile, 'mid arches gray, Whilst hollow winds through mantling ivy sigh! And even the mouldering shrine is rent away, Where, in his warrior weeds, the British Arthur lay. Now look upon the sister fane of Wells! It lifts its forehead in the summer air; Sweet, o'er the champagne, sound its Sabbath bells, Its roof rolls back the chant, or voice of prayer. Anxious we ask, Will Heaven that temple spare, Or mortal tempest sweep it from its state! Oh! say,—shall time revere the fabric fair, Or shall it meet, in distant years, thy fate, Shattered, proud pile, like thee, and left as desolate! No! to subdue or elevate the soul, Our best, our purest feelings to refine, Still shall the solemn diapasons roll, Through that high fane! still hues, reflected, shine From the tall windows on the sculptured shrine, Tinging the pavement! for He shall afford, He who directs the storm, his aid divine, Because its Sion has not left thy word, Nor sought for other guide than thee, Almighty Lord! SILCHESTER, THE ANCIENT CALEVA. The wild pear whispers, and the ivy crawls, Along the circuit of thine ancient walls, Lone city of the dead! and near this mound, The buried coins of mighty men are found, Silent remains of Cæsars and of kings, Soldiers of whose renown the world yet rings, In its sad story! These have had their day Of glory, and have passed, like sounds, away! And such their fame! While we the spot behold, And muse upon the tale that Time has told, We ask where are they?—they whose clarion brayed, Whose chariot glided, and whose war-horse neighed; Whose cohorts hastened o'er the echoing way, Whose eagles glittered to the orient ray! Ask of this fragment, reared by Roman hands, That, now, a lone and broken column stands! Ask of that road—whose track alone remains— That swept, of old, o'er mountains, downs, and plains; And still along the silent champagne leads; Where are its noise of cars and tramp of steeds? Ask of the dead, and silence will reply; Go, seek them in the grave of mortal vanity! Is this a Roman veteran?—look again,— It is a British soldier, who, in Spain, At Albuera's glorious fight, has bled; He, too, has spurred his charger o'er the dead! Desolate, now—friendless and desolate— Let him the tale of war and home relate. His wife (and Gainsborough such a form and mien Would paint, in harmony with such a scene), With pensive aspect, yet demeanour bland, A tottering infant guided by her hand, Spoke of her own green Erin, while her child, Amid the scene of ancient glory, smiled, As spring's first flower smiles from a monument Of other years, by time and ruin rent! Lone city of the dead! thy pride is past, Thy temples sunk, as at the whirlwind's blast! Silent—all silent, where the mingled cries Of gathered myriads rent the purple skies! Here—where the summer breezes waved the wood— The stern and silent gladiator stood, And listened to the shouts that hailed his gushing blood. And on this wooded mount, that oft, of yore, Hath echoed to the Lybian lion's roar, The ear scarce catches, from the shady glen, The small pipe of the solitary wren. RESTORATION OF MALMESBURY ABBEY. Monastic and time-consecrated fane! Thou hast put on thy shapely state again, Almost august as in thy early day, Ere ruthless Henry rent thy pomp away. No more the mass on holidays is sung, The Host high raised, or fuming censer swung; No more, in amice white, the fathers, slow, With lighted tapers, in long order go; Yet the tall window lifts its arched height, As to admit heaven's pale, but purer light; Those massy clustered columns, whose long rows, Even at noonday, in shadowy pomp repose, Amid the silent sanctity of death, Like giants seem to guard the dust beneath. Those roofs re-echo (though no altars blaze) The prayer of penitence, the hymn of praise; Whilst meek Religion's self, as with a smile, Reprints the tracery of the holy pile, Worthy its guest, the temple. What remains? O mightiest Master! thy immortal strains These roofs demand; listen! with prelude slow, Solemnly sweet, yet full, the organs blow. And, hark! again, heard ye the choral chant Peal through the echoing arches, jubilant? More softly now, imploring litanies, Wafted to heaven, and mingling with the sighs Of penitence from yon altar rise; Again the vaulted roof “Hosannahs” rings— “Hosannah! Lord of lords, and King of kings!” Rent, but not prostrate; stricken, yet sublime; Reckless alike of injuries or time; Thou, unsubdued, in silent majesty, The tempest hast defied and shalt defy! The temple of our Sion so shall mock The muttering storm, the very earthquake's shock, Founded, O Christ, on thy eternal rock! ON THE FUNERAL OF CHARLES THE FIRST, AT NIGHT, IN ST GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR. 1 The castle clock had tolled midnight: With mattock and with spade, And silent, by the torches' light, His corse in earth we laid. 2 The coffin bore his name, that those Of other years might know, When earth its secrets should disclose, Whose bones were laid below. 3 “Peace to the dead” no children sung, Slow pacing up the nave,— No prayers were read, no knell was rung, As deep we dug his grave. 4 We only heard the winter's wind, In many a sullen gust, As, o'er the open grave inclined, We murmured, “Dust to dust!” 5 A moonbeam from the arch's height Streamed, as we placed the stone; The long aisles started into light, And all the windows shone. 6 We thought we saw the banners then, That shook along the walls, Whilst the sad shades of mailèd men Were gazing on the stalls. 7 'Tis gone! again on tombs defaced Sits darkness more profound; And only by the torch we traced The shadows on the ground. 8 And now the chilling, freezing air Without blew long and loud; Upon our knees we breathed one prayer, Where he slept in his shroud. 9 We laid the broken marble floor,— No name, no trace appears,— And when we closed the sounding door, We thought of him with tears. ON SEEING PLANTS IN THE WINDOWS OF SETH WARD'S COLLEGE, ENDOWED FOR WIDOWS OF CLERGYMEN, AT SALISBURY. There is but one stage more in life's long way, O widowed women! Sadly upon your path Hath evening, bringing change of scenes and friends, Descended, since the morn of hope shone fair; And lonely age is yours, whose tears have fallen Upon a husband's grave,—with whom, long since, Amid the quietude of village scenes, We walked, and saw your little children grow Like lovely plants beside you, or adorned Your lowly garden-plot with summer flowers; And heard the bells, upon the Sabbath morn, Chime to the village church, when he you loved Walked by your side to prayer. These images Of days long passed, of love and village life, You never can forget; and many a plant Green growing at the windows of your home, And one pale primrose, in small earthen vase, And bird-cage in the sunshine at the door, Remember you, though in a city pent, Of morning walks along the village lane, Of the lark singing through the vernal hail, Of swallows skimming o'er the garden pond,— Remember you of children and of friends Parted, and pleasant summers gone! 'Tis meet To nurse such recollections, not with pain, But in submission to the will of Heaven; Thankful that here, as the calm eve of life, In pious privacy, steals on, one hearth Of charity is yours; and cold must be That heart, which, of the changes of the world Unmindful, could receive you but as guests, Who had seen happier days! Yet one stage more, And your long rest will be with him you loved. Oh! pray to God that each may rest in hope! MORLEY'S FAREWELL TO THE COTTAGE OF ISAAK WALTON. TO KENNA. England, a long farewell! a long farewell, My country, to thy woods, and streams, and hills! Where I have heard in youth the Sabbath bell, For many a year now mute: affection fills Mine eyes with tears; yet resolute to wait, Whatever ills betide, whatever fate; Far from my native land, from sights of woe, From scaffolds drenched in generous blood, I go. Sad, in a land of strangers, when I bend With grief of heart, without a home or friend, And chiefly when with weary thoughts oppressed, I see the sun sink slowly in the west; Then, doubly feeling my forsaken lot, I shall remember, far away, this cot Of humble piety, and prayer, and peace, And thee, dear friend, till my heart's beatings cease. Warm from that heart I breathe one parting prayer: My good old friend, may God Almighty spare— Spare, for the sake of that poor child, thy life,— Long spare it for thy meek and duteous wife. Perhaps o'er them, when the hard storm blows loud, We both may be at rest and in our shroud; Or we may live to talk of these sad times, When virtue was reviled, and direst crimes Faith's awful name usurped. We may again Hear heavenly truths in the time-hallowed fane, And the full chant. Oh! if that day arrive, And we, old friend, though bowed with age, survive, How happy, whilst our days on earth shall last, To pray and think of seasons that are past, Till on our various way the night shall close, And in one hallowed pile, at last, our bones repose. THE GRAVE OF BISHOP KEN. 1 On yonder heap of earth forlorn, Where Ken his place of burial chose, Peacefully shine, O Sabbath morn! And, eve, with gentlest hush, repose. 2 To him is reared no marble tomb, Within the dim cathedral fane; But some faint flowers, of summer bloom, And silent falls the wintry rain. 3 No village monumental stone Records a verse, a date, a name— What boots it? when thy task is done, Christian, how vain the sound of fame! 4 Oh! far more grateful to thy God, The voices of poor children rise, Who hasten o'er the dewy sod, “To pay their morning sacrifice.” 5 And can we listen to their hymn, Heard, haply, when the evening knell Sounds, where the village brow is dim, As if to bid the world farewell! 6 Without a thought that from the dust The morn shall wake the sleeping clay, And bid the faithful and the just Upspring to heaven's eternal day! THE LEGEND OF ST CECILIA AND THE ANGEL. 'Twas when, O meekest eve! thy shadows dim Were slowly stealing round, With more impassioned sound Divine Cecilia sang her vesper hymn, And swelled the solemn chord In hallelujahs to thy name, O Lord! And now I see her raise Rapt adoration's gaze, With lips just opening, and with humid eyes Uplifted; whilst the strain Now sinks, now swells again; Now rising, seems to blend with heaven's own harmonies. But who is that, divinely fair, With more than mortal beauty in his mien; With eyes of heavenly hue and glistening hair, His white and ample wings half seen! O radiant and immortal guest! Why hast thou left thy seraph throng, On earth the triumph to attest Of Beauty, Piety, and Song! SUPPOSED ADDRESS TO BISHOP KEN. 1 Though his words might well deceive me, Though to earth abased I bend, Christian guide, thou wilt not leave me, Thus on earth without a friend! 2 I thought his vows were oaths in heaven, Nor dare I here my fault deny; For all my soul to him was given, God knows how true, how tenderly! 3 Though wronged and desolate and dying, His pride, his coldness, I forgot, And fell upon his bosom, crying, Forsake me not—forsake me not! 4 I left my father, and my mother, Whom I no more on earth may see, But I have found a father, brother, And more than every friend, in thee! 5 Although his words might well deceive me, Though wronged, and desolate I lie, Christian guide, thou wilt not leave me, Oh, teach me to repent and die! ON AN ECLIPSE OF THE MOON AT MIDNIGHT. Up, up, into the vast extended space, Thou art ascending in thy majesty, Beautiful moon, the queen of the pale sky! But what is that which gathers on thy face, A dark mysterious shade, eclipsing, slow, The splendour of thy calm and steadfast light? It is the shadow of this world of woe, Of this vast moving world; portentous sight! As if we almost stood and saw more near Its very action—almost heard it roll On, in the swiftness of its dread career, As it hath rolled for ages! Hush, my soul! Listen! there is no sound; but we could hear The murmur of its multitudes, who toil Through their brief hour. The heart might well recoil; But this is ever sounding in His ear Who made it, and who said, “Let there be light!” And we, the creatures of a mortal hour, 'Mid hosts of worlds, are ever in his sight, Catching, as now, dim glimpses of his power. The time shall come when all this mighty scene Darkness shall wrap, as it had never been. O Father of all worlds! be thou our guide, And lead us gently on, from youth to age, Through the dark valley of our pilgrimage; Enough if thus, bending to thy high will, We hold our Christian course through good or ill, And to the end with faith and hope abide. TO LADY VALLETORT, ON HEARING HER SING “GLORIA IN EXCELSIS,” WITH THREE OTHER YOUNG LADIES, AT LACOCK ABBEY, OCTOBER 1831. Fair inmate of these ivied walls, beneath Whose silent cloisters Ella sleeps in death, Let loftier bards, in rich and glowing lays, Thy gentleness, thy grace, thy virtue praise! Be mine to breathe one prayer; when all rejoice, One parting prayer, still mindful of that voice, And musing on the sacred song which stole, Sweet as the spell of peace, upon the soul; In those same scenes, where once the chapel dim Echoed the cloistered sisters' vesper hymn:— Live long! live happy! tranquil through the strife And the loud stir of this tumultuous life! Live long, live happy! and when many a day Hath passed in the heart's harmony away; When Eve's pale hand the gates of life shall close, And hush the landscape to its last repose; May sister seraphs meet with welcome song, And gently say, Why have you stayed so long? ON SEEING A BUST OF R. B. SHERIDAN, FROM A CAST TAKEN AFTER DEATH. Alas, poor Sheridan! when first we met, 'Twas 'mid a smiling circle, and thine eye, That flashed with eloquent hilarity And playful fancy, I remember yet Freshly as yesterday. The gay and fair, The young and beautiful,—now in their graves— Surrounded us; while on the lucid wave Of Hampton's waters, to the morning air The streamer softly played of our light boat, Which seemed as on a magic sea to float. I saw thee after in this crowd of life, Conflicting, but yet blandly, with its strife. As the still car of Time rolled on, thy cheek Wore the same smile, yet with a trace more weak. Lone sorrow came as life declined, and care, And age, with slowly furrowing line, was there. I could have spared this fearful sight! Most strange Is the eventful tale of mortal change, Inevitable; but death, brought so nigh, In form so tangible, harrows the eye. As all the past floats like a cloud away, Alas, poor Sheridan! I turn and say, Not without feelings which such sights impart, Sad, but instructive, to the Christian's heart! May 18, 1826. RETURN OF GEORGE III. TO WINDSOR CASTLE. Not that thy name, illustrious dome! recalls The pomp of chivalry in bannered halls, The blaze of beauty, and the gorgeous sights Of heralds, trophies, steeds, and crested knights; Not that young Surrey there beguiled the hour With “eyes upturned unto the maiden's tower;” Oh! not for these the muse officious brings Her gratulations to the best of kings; But that from cities and from crowds withdrawn, Calm peace may meet him on the twilight lawn; That here among these gray primeval trees, He may inhale health's animating breeze; That these old oaks, which far their shadows cast, May soothe him while they whisper of the past; And when from that proud terrace he surveys Slow Thames devolving his majestic maze (Now lost on the horizon's verge, now seen Winding through lawns and woods, and pastures green), May he reflect upon the waves that roll, Bearing a nation's wealth from pole to pole, And own (ambition's proudest boast above) A king's best glory is his country's love. ON MEETING SOME FRIENDS OF YOUTH AT CHELTENHAM, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE PARTED AT OXFORD. “And wept to see the paths of life divide.” —Shenstone. Here the companions of our careless prime, Whom fortune's various ways have severed long, Since that fair dawn when Hope her vernal song Sang blithe, with features marked by stealing time At these restoring springs are met again! We, young adventurers on life's opening road, Set out together; to their last abode Some have sunk silent, some a while remain, Some are dispersed; of many, growing old In life's obscurer bourne, no tale is told. Here, ere the shades of the long night descend, And all our wanderings in oblivion end, The parted meet once more, and pensive trace (Marked by that hand unseen, whose iron pen Writes “mortal change” upon the fronts of men) The creeping furrows in each other's face. Where shall we meet again? Reflection sighs; Where? In the dust! Time rushing on replies: Then hail the hope that lights the pilgrim's way, Where there is neither change, nor darkness, nor decay! THE LAY OF TALBOT, THE TROUBADOUR. A LEGEND OF LACOCK ABBEY. PART FIRST. 1 At Rouen Richard kept his state, Released from captive thrall; And girt with many a warrior guest He feasted in the hall! 2 The rich metheglin mantled high, The wine was berry red, When tidings came that Salisbury, His early friend, was dead; 3 And that his sole surviving child, The heiress of his wealth, By crafty kinsmen and allies Was borne away by stealth; 4 Was borne away from Normandy, Where, secretly confined, She heard no voice of those she loved, But sighed to the north wind. 5 Haply from some lone castle's tower Or solitary strand, Even now she gazes o'er the deep, That laves her father's land! 6 King Richard cries, My minstrel knights, Who will the task achieve, To seek through France and Normandy The orphan left to grieve? 7 Young William Talbot then did speak, Betide me weal or woe, From Michael's castle through the land A pilgrim I will go. 8 He clad him in his pilgrim weeds, With trusty staff in hand, And scallop shell, and took his way, A wanderer through the land. 9 For two long years he journeyed on, A pilgrim, day by day, Through many a forest dark and drear, By many a castle gray. 10 At length, when one clear morn of frost Was shining on the main, Forth issuing from a castle gate He saw a female train! 11 With lightsome step and waving hair, Before them ran a child, And gathering from the sands a shell, Ran back to them, and smiled. 12 Himself unseen among the rocks, He saw her point her hand; And cry, I would go home, go home, To my poor father's land. 13 The bell tolled from the turret gray, Cold freezing fell the dew, To the portcullis hastening back The female train withdrew. 14 Those turrets and the battlements, Time and the storm had beat, And sullenly the ocean tide Came rolling at his feet. 15 Young Talbot cast away his staff, The harp is in his hand, A minstrel at the castle gate, A porter saw him stand. 16 And who art thou, the porter cried, Young troubadour, now say, For welcome in the castle hall Will be to-night thy lay; 17 For this the birthday is of one, Whose father now is cold; An English maiden, rich in fee, And this year twelve years old. 18 I love, myself, now growing old, To hear the wild harp's sound: But whence, young harper, dost thou come, And whither art thou bound? 19 Though I am young, the harper said, From Syria's sands I come, A minstrel warrior of the Cross, Now poor and wandering home. 20 And I can tell of mighty deeds, By bold King Richard done, King Richard of “the Lion's heart,” Foes quail to look upon. 21 Then lead me to the castle hall, And let the fire be bright, For never hall nor bower hath heard A lay like mine to-night. 22 The windows gleam within the hall, The fire is blazing bright, And the young harper's hair and harp Are shining in the light. 23 Fair dames and warriors clad in steel Now gather round to hear, And oft that little maiden's eyes Are glistening with a tear. 24 For, when the minstrel sang of wars, At times, with softer sound, He touched the chords, as mourning those Now laid in the cold ground. 25 He sang how brave King Richard pined In a dark tower immured, And of the long and weary nights, A captive, he endured. 26 The faithful Blondel to his harp One song began to sing; It ceased; the king takes up the strain; It is his lord and king! 27 Of Sarum then, and Sarum's plain, That poor child heard him speak, When the first tear-drop in her eye Fell silent on her cheek. 28 For, as the minstrel told his tale, The breathless orphan maid Thought of the land where, in the grave, Her father's bones were laid. 29 Hush, hush! the winds are piping loud, The midnight hour is sped, The hours of morn are stealing fast, Harper, to bed! to bed! PART SECOND. 1 The two long years had passed away, When castle Galliard rose, As built at once by elfin hands, And scorning time or foes. 2 It might be thought that Merlin's imps Were tasked to raise the wall, That unheard axes fell the woods, While unseen hammers fall. 3 As hung by magic on a rock, The castle-keep looked down O'er rocks and rivers, and the smoke Of many a far off town. 4 And now, young knights and minstrels gay Obeyed their masters' call, And loud rejoicing held the feast In the new raftered hall. 5 His minstrels and his mailed peers Were seated at the board, And at his side the highest sat William of the Long Sword. 6 This youthful knight, of princely birth, Was dazzling to behold, For his chain-mail from head to foot All glistened o'er with gold. 7 His surcoat dyed with azure blue In graceful foldings hung, And there the golden lions ramped, With bloody claws and tongue. 8 With crimson belt around his waist His sword was girded on; The hilt, a cross to kiss in death, Radiant with jewels shone. 9 The names and banners of each knight It were too long to tell; Here sat the brave Montgomery, There Bertrand and Rozell. 10 Of Richard's unresisted sword A noble minstrel sung, Whilst to an hundred answering harps The blazing gallery rung. 11 So all within was merriment— When, suddenly, a shout, As of some unexpected guest, Burst from the crowd without. 12 Now not a sound, and scarce a breath, Through the long hall is heard, When, with a young maid by his side, A vizored knight appeared. 13 Up the long hall they held their way, On to the royal seat; Then both together, hand in hand, Knelt at King Richard's feet. 14 Talbot, a Talbot! rang the hall With gratulation wild, Long live brave Talbot, and long live Earl William's new found child! 15 Amid a scene so new and strange, This poor maid could not speak; King Richard took her by the hand, And gently kissed her cheek; 16 Then placed her, smiling through a tear, By his brave brother's side: Long live brave Longspe! rang the hall, Long live his future bride! 17 To noble Richard, this fair child, His ward, was thus restored; Destined to be the future bride Of Him of the Long Sword. THE ARK: A POEM FOR MUSIC. MICHAEL, ARCHANGEL. High on Imaus' solitary van, Which overlooked the kingdoms of the world, With stature more majestic, his stern brow In the clear light, the thunder at his feet; In his right hand the flaming sword that waved O'er Eden's gate; and in his left the trump, That on the day of doom shall sound and wake Earth's myriads, starting from the wormy grave, The great archangel stood: and, hark, his voice! AIR. It comes, it comes, o'er cities, temples, towers; O'er mountain heights I see the deluge sweep; Heard ye from earth the cry at that last hour? Heard ye the tossing of the desert deep? How dismal is its roar! I heard the sound of multitudes no more. Great Lord of heaven and earth, thy voice is fate; Thou canst destroy, as first thou didst create! He stood and sounded the archangel's trump; And now a choir of seraphim drew near, By Raphael led: in sad and solemn strains, They raised their supplication to Heaven's throne. CHORUS. O Thou whose mighty voice, “Let there be light!” Dread Chaos heard, when the great sun from night Burst forth, and demon shadows fled away, And the green earth sprang beautiful to day! Oh! merciful in judgment, hear our prayer; Behold the world which Thou hast made so fair, And man the mourner, man the sinner, spare. GABRIEL (RECITATIVE). Oh! what a change have sin and sorrow made! In the beginning, God created heaven And earth; and man, amid the works of God, Majestic stood, his noblest creature, formed In God's own image; and his fair abode Was visited by seraph shapes of light, And sin and death were not. TRIO. Mourn, mourn, ye bowers Of paradise, ye pleasant hills and woods! Mourn; for the dreadful voice hath passed that shrunk Your streams, and withered all your blooming flowers. And thou, created in God's image, man! Go forth into the nether world; “for dust Thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” RECITATIVE. So, led by Sin and Death, and his pale troop, Impatient came, and all this goodly scene, As at the withering of a demon's curse, was blasted. Then they two went forth, from whom Their children sorrow and sin and death derived: They two went forth into the forlorn world, Heart-struck, but not despairing. From that hour Death's shadow walks on earth, a hideous form, Saddening the very sun; and giant crimes Have multiplied, till to the throne of God, And the serene air of untroubled bliss, The noise of violence, and the cries of blood, Have from the ground ascended. Therefore God Me hath commissioned to uplift the trump Of doom, and sweep this world of sin away! WRITTEN AFTER THE CONSECRATION OF THE NEW CHURCH AT KINGSWOOD. When first the fane, that, white, on Kingswood-Pen, Arrests, far off, the pausing stranger's ken, Echoed the hymn of praise, and on that day, Which seemed to shine with more auspicious ray, When thousands listened to the prelate there, Who called on God, with consecrating prayer;— I saw a village-maid, almost a child, Even as a light-haired cherub, undefiled From earth's rank fume, with innocent look, her eye Meekly uplifted to the throne on high, Join in the full choir's solemn harmony. Oh, then, how many boding thoughts arose, Lest, long ere varied life's uncertain close, Those looks of modesty, that open truth Lighting the forehead of ingenuous youth— Lest these, as slowly steal maturing years, Should fade, and grief succeed, and dimming tears; Then should the cheek be blanched with early care, Sin mark its first and furrowing traces there, With touch corroding mar the altered mien, And leave a canker where the rose had been; Then the sweet child, whose smiles can now impart Joy overpowering to a mother's heart, Might bring down, when not anxious love could save, That mother's few gray hairs with sorrow to the grave! But, hark! the preacher's voice, his accents bland, Behold his kindled look, his lifted hand; What holy fervour wakes at his command! He speaks of faith, of mercy from above, Of heavenly hope, of a Redeemer's love! Hence every thought, but that which shows fair youth Advancing in the paths of peace and truth! Which shows thy light, O pure religion! shed, Like a faint glory, on a daughter's head, Who shall each parent's love, through life, repay, And add a transport to their dying day! I saw an old man, on his staff reclined, Who seemed to every human change resigned:— He, with white locks, and long-descending beard, A patriarch of other years appeared: And thine, O aged, solitary man! Was life's enchanted way, when life began, The sunshine on each mountain, and the strain Of some sweet melody, in every plain; Thine was illusive fortune's transient gleam, And young love's broken, but delicious dream; Those mocking visions of thy youth are flown, And thou dost bend on death's dark brink alone The light associates of thy vernal day, Where are they? Blown, like the sere leaves, away; And thou dost seem a trunk, on whose bare head The gray moss of uncounted days is spread! I know thee not, old man! yet traits like these, Upon thy time-worn features fancy sees. Another, or another year, for thee, Haply, “the silver cord shall loosed be!” Then listen, whilst warm eloquence portrays That “better country” to thy anxious gaze, Who art a weary, way-worn “pilgrim here,” And soon from life's vain masque to disappear. O aged man! lift up thine eyes—behold What brighter views of distant light unfold; What though the loss of strength thou dost deplore, Or broken loves, or friends that are no more? What though gay youth no more his song renews, And summer-light dies, like the rainbow hues? The Christian hails the ray that cheers the gloom, And throws its heavenly halo round the tomb. Who bade the grave its mouldering vault unclose? “Christ—Christ who died; yea, rather, Christ who rose!” Hope lifts from earth her tear-illumined eye, She sees, dispersed, the world's last tempest fly; Sees death, arrested 'mid his havoc vast, Lord, at thy feet his broken weapons cast! In circles, far retiring from the sight, Till, undistinguished, they are lost in light, Admiring seraphim suspend their wings, Whilst, hark! the eternal empyrean rings, Hosannah, Lord of lords, and King of kings! Such thoughts arose, when from the crowded fane I saw retire the mute, assembled train; Their images beguiled my homeward way, Which high o'er Lansdowne's lonely summit lay. There seemed a music in the evening gale, And looking back on the long-spreading vale, Methought a blessing waited on the hour, As the last light from heaven shone on the distant tower. ON THE DEATH OF DR BURGESS, THE LATE BISHOP OF SALISBURY. Sainted old man, for more than eighty years, Thee—tranquilly and stilly-creeping—age, Led to the confines of the sepulchre, And thy last day on earth—but “Father—Lord— Which art in heaven”—how pure a faith, and heart Unmoved, amid the changes of this life, And tumult of the world,—and oh! what hope,— What love and constancy of the calm mind, And tears to misery from the inmost heart Flowing—at times, a brief sweet smile and voice How bland, and studies, various and profound, Of learned languages—but, ever first, That learning which the oracles of God Unfolds, even to the close of life's long day Thy course accompanies! But, thou, farewell, And live—this mortal veil removed—in bliss; Live with the saints in light, whom Christ had loved. But pardon us, left in this vale of tears, For one last tear upon thy cold remains— Pardon, beloved and venerated shade! LINES WRITTEN ON FONTHILL ABBEY. The mighty master waved his wand, and, lo! On the astonished eye the glorious show Burst like a vision! Spirit of the place! Has the Arabian wizard with his mace Smitten the barren downs, far onward spread, And bade the enchanted palace rise instead? Bade the dark woods their solemn shades extend, High to the clouds yon spiry tower ascend? And starting from the umbrageous avenue Spread the rich pile, magnificent to view? Enter! From the arched portal look again, Back on the lessening woods and distant plain! Ascend the steps! The high and fretted roof Is woven by some elfin hand aloof; Whilst from the painted windows' long array A mellow light is shed as not of day. How gorgeous all! Oh, never may the spell Be broken, that arrayed those radiant forms so well! EPITAPH ON BENJAMIN TREMLYN, AN OLD SOLDIER, BURIED IN BREMHILL CHURCHYARD AT THE AGE OF 92. A poor old soldier shall not lie unknown, Without a verse, and this recording stone. 'Twas his in youth o'er distant lands to stray, Danger and death companions of his way. Here in his native village, drooping, age Closed the lone evening of his pilgrimage. Speak of the past, of names of high renown, Or his brave comrades long to dust gone down, His eye with instant animation glowed, Though ninety winters on his head had snowed. His country, whilst he lived, a boon supplied, And faith her shield held o'er him when he died; Hope, Christian, that his spirit lives with God, And pluck the wild weeds from his lowly sod, Where, dust to dust, beside the chancel's shade, Till the last trumpet sounds, a brave man's bones are laid. EPITAPH ON ROBERT SOUTHEY. Christian! for none who scorns that holy name Can gaze with honest eyes on Southey's fame; Christian! bow down thy head in humble fear, And think what God-given powers lie silenced here: Wit, judgment, memory, patience unsubdued, Conception vast, and pious fortitude. Learning possessed no steeps, and truth no shore, Beyond his step to tread, his wing to soar; His was the historian's pen, the poet's lyre, The churchman's ardour, and the patriot's fire; While fireside charities, Heaven's gentlest dower, Lent genius all their warmth and all their power. O Church and State of England! thine was he In living fame, thine be his memory! Thou saw'st him live, in faith expire, Go, bid thy sons to follow, and admire! SONNET. WRITTEN IN A COPY OF FALCONER'S “SHIPWRECK.” What pale and bleeding youth, whilst the fell blast Howls o'er the wreck, and fainter sinks the cry Of struggling wretches ere, o'erwhelmed, they die, Yet floats upborne upon the driving mast! O poor Arion! has thy sweetest strain, That charmed old ocean's wildest solitude, At this dread hour his waves' dark might subdued! Let sea-maids thy reclining head sustain, And wipe the blood and briny drops that soil Thy features; give once more the wreathed shell To ring with melody! Ah, fruitless toil! O'er thy devoted head the tempests swell, More loud relentless ocean claims his spoil: Peace! and may weeping sea-maids sing thy knell! ON FIRST HEARING CARADORI SING. Spirit of beauty, and of heavenly song! No longer seek in vain, 'mid the loud throng, 'Mid the discordant tumults of mankind, One spirit, gentle as thyself, to find. Oh! listen, and suspend thy upward wings, Listen—for, hark! 'tis Caradori sings; Hear, on the cadence of each thrilling note, Airs scarce of earth, and sounds seraphic float! See, in the radiant smile that lights her face; See, in that form, a more than magic grace; And say (repaid for every labour past) Beautiful spirit, thou art found at last! SALISBURY CATHEDRAL. Here stood the city of the dead; look round— Dost thou not mark a visionary band, Druids and bards upon the summits stand, Of the majestic and time-hallowed mound? Hark! heard ye not at times the acclaiming word Of harps, as when those bards, in white array, Hailed the ascending lord of light and day! Here, o'er the clouds, the first cathedral rose, Whose prelates now in yonder fane repose, Among the mighty of years passed away; For there her latest seat Religion chose, There still to heaven ascends the holy lay, And never may those shrines in dust and silence close! April 1834. LOCKSWELL. Pure fount, that, welling from this wooded hill, Dost wander forth, as into life's wide vale, Thou to the traveller dost tell no tale Of other years; a lone, unnoticed rill, In thy forsaken track, unheard of men, Melting thy own sweet music through the glen. Time was when other sounds and songs arose; When o'er the pensive scene, at evening's close, The distant bell was heard; or the full chant, At morn, came sounding high and jubilant; Or, stealing on the wildered pilgrim's way, The moonlight “Miserere” died away, Like all things earthly. Stranger, mark the spot; No echoes of the chiding world intrude. The structure rose and vanished; solitude Possessed the woods again; old Time forgot, Passing to wider spoil, its place and name. Since then, even as the clouds of yesterday, Seven hundred years have well-nigh passed away; No wreck remains of all its early pride; Like its own orisons, its fame has died. But this pure fount, through rolling years the same, Yet lifts its small still voice, like penitence, Or lowly prayer. Then pass admonished hence, Happy, thrice happy, if, through good or ill, Christian, thy heart respond to this forsaken rill. ON MOZART. Oh! still, as with a seraph's voice, prolong The harmonies of that enchanting song, Till, listening, we might almost think we hear, Beyond this cloudy world, in the pure sphere Of light, acclaiming hosts the throne surrounding, The long hosannahs evermore resounding, Soft voices interposed in pure accord, Breathing a holier charm. Oh! every word Falls like a drop of silver, as the strain, In winding sweetness, swells and sinks again. Sing ever thus, beguiling life's long way, As here, poor pilgrims of the earth, we stray; And, lady, when thy pilgrimage shall end, And late the shades of the long night descend, May sister seraphs welcome with a song, And gently say, Why have you stayed so long? EPITAPH ON JOHN HARDING, IN THE CHURCHYARD OF BREMHILL. Lay down thy pilgrim staff upon this heap, And till the morning of redemption sleep, Old wayfarer of earth! From youth to age, Long, but not weary, was thy pilgrimage, Thy Christian pilgrimage; for faith and prayer Alone enabled thee some griefs to bear. Lone, in old age, without a husband's aid, Thy wife shall pray beside thee to be laid; For more than a kind father didst thou prove To fourteen children of her faithful love. May future fathers of the village trace The same sure path to the same resting-place; And future sons, taught in their strength to save, Learn their first lesson from a poor man's grave! April 1835. ON THE DEATH OF WILLIAM LINLEY, ESQ., THE COMPOSER OF THE MUSIC OF “THE DUENNA,” ETC. Poor Linley! I shall miss thee sadly, now Thou art not in the world; for few remain Who loved like thee the high and holy strain Of harmony's immortal master. Thou Didst honour him; and none I know, who live, Could even a shadow, a faint image give, With chord and voice, of those rich harmonies, Which, mingled in one mighty volume, rise, Glorious, from earth to heaven, so to express Choral acclaim to Heaven's almightiness, As thou! Therefore, amid the world's deep roar, When the sweet visions of young Hope are fled, And many friends dispersed, and many dead, I grieve that I shall hear that voice no more. INSCRIBED TO THE MARCHIONESS OF LANSDOWNE Go to assemblies of the rich and gay, The blazing hall of grandeur, and the throng Of cities, and there listen to the song Of festive harmony; then pause, and say, Where is she found, who in her sphere might shine, Attracting all? Where is she found, whose place And dignity the proudest court might grace? Go, where the desolate and dying pine On their cold bed; open the cottage door; Ask of that aged pair, who feebly bend O'er their small evening fire, who is their friend; Ask of these children of the village poor; For this, at the great judgment, thou shalt find Heaven's mercy, Lady, merciful and kind. HYMN FOR MUSIC, AFTER THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO. Perish! Almighty Justice cried, And struck the avenging blow, And Europe shouts from side to side, The tyrant is laid low! Said not his heart, More blood shall stream Around my sovereign throne? He wakes from dire ambition's dream, Pale, trembling, and alone. ARIA WITH CHORUS. Triumph! the rescued nations cry, Triumph! ten thousand hearts reply. Sad mother, weep no more thy children slain; The trumpets and the battle clangours cease: Uplift to heaven the loud, the grateful strain, And hail the dawn of Freedom and of Peace. CHORUS. Triumph! the rescued nations cry, Triumph! ten thousand hearts reply. ARIA. For joy returned, for peace restored, Lord of all worlds, to thee we raise, While Slaughter drops his weary sword, To thee the hymn of gratitude and praise. CHORUS. Triumph! the rescued nations cry, Triumph! ten thousand hearts reply. INSCRIPTIONS IN THE GARDENS OF BREMHILL RECTORY. ON A TREE COMMANDING A VIEW OF THE WHOLE EXTENT OF BOWOOD. When in thy sight another's vast domain Spreads its long line of woods, dost thou complain? Nay, rather thank the God that placed thy state Above the lowly, but beneath the great! And still His name with gratitude revere, Who blessed the Sabbath of thy leisure here. ON A RURAL SEAT. Rest, stranger, in this decorated scene, That hangs its beds of flowers, its slopes so green; So from the walks of life the weeds remove, But fix thy better hopes on scenes above. ON THE FRONT OF A HERMITAGE, NEAR A DIAL. To mark life's few and fleeting hours I placed the dial 'midst the flowers, Which one by one came forth and died, Still withering by its ancient side. Mortals, let the sight impart Its pensive moral to thy heart! QUIETI ET MUSIS. Be thine Retirement's peaceful joys, And a life that makes no noise; Save when Fancy, musing long, Wakes her desultory song; Sounding to the vacant ear, Like the rill that murmurs near. THE END.</field>
