      <field name="fulltext">[To set a Manlie heade vpon a Horses necke] To set a Manlie heade vpon a Horses necke, And all the lims with diuers plumes of diuers hue to decke, Or paint a womans face aloft to open showe, And make the Picture ende in fish, with scaly skinne belowe I thinke (my friendes) would cause you laugh and smile to see How yl these yl compacted things and members would agree. The first Egloge of Mantuan, intituled FAVSTVS. The Argument. As Shepheards custome is when they do meete yfeare, To talke of this or that, and tell the newes they heare: So Fortunatus craues of Faustus to begin Of auncient loues to treate, whilst flocks a feeding byn. When friendly Faustus sawe his earnest friends request: To tale of honest loue the Shepheard him addrest. The speakers names. Fortunatus. Faustus. Fortunat' Frend Faustus, pray thee, since our flock in shade and pleasaunt vale Doth chewe the cudde: of auncient loue let vs begin to tale. Least if by hap vnhappy sleepe our senses should begyle, Some sauage beast in sprouted corne our cattell catch the while: For many such about the fields do lurking lye in wayte. Wherfore to watch is better far than sleepe in my conceyte. Faustus This place, this self same shady bushe that shrowds vs from the heate, Knows how I haue b? cloyd with cares and Cupids coales yfreat These .iiij. yeares space, or .ij. at least if I remember well. But synce we are at leasure both, and pleasaunt is to tell: I will begin the whole discourse and shewe thee how it fell. Here I, whilst in my tender youth of cattell should had care, Would spread my garm?t on the soyle, and bolte vpright would stare Into the open Skyes alofte: with dolefull drops of bryne And heauy playnt recounting of this curssed fate of myne. No pleasure I in quiet tooke, no labour did delight My pensiue brest, my Sense was dull, quight buried was my Sprite: As is the stomacke of the sicke whom no good taste allures Of lothsome meate, nor patients mynd to appetite procures. Delight of Musicke was berefte, for Pipe I did not passe Compacted of vnegall quilles, my bowe but lothsome was. The slyng &amp; hound were hateful both, no pleasure I did put In foulyng then, twas yrkesom eke with knyfe to cracke the Nut. To make the bulrushe basquet, or to guyle the fishe with gyn, Or searche y? brakes for breeding byrds I forced not a pyn. Palester playes, and casting lots with finger I ne wayd: Nor former games that pleasant were ere I this grief assayd. Wilde grapes to gather was a gall, and Strawberries to pull. I mournd as Tereus wife is wonte, that hauyng beake as full Of foode as it can hold, when she retourns from hir repast And sees hir yonglings borne away, she wareth all agast: And from the byll downe fals the bayte, hir heart begyns to quayle, And to the neighbour bushe she flies hir cruell haps to wayle For broud so lately borne away. Or as the gallant cowe That hauyng loste hir louing calfe in field begins to lowe. And hauing filld the place with noyse and crying out a good: Repaires to shade and eates no grasse nor dips hir flaps in floud. But why do I with long discourse thy lystnyng eares offend? This processe makes me both my tyme and words in waste to spend. This is the summe of all my tale, it grieu'd my weary sprite That miser I with these myne eyes did see the lothsome light. And if thou longyng for to learne the whole effect, shouldst say: Who (Faustus) to these dredfull rockes did thee compell I pray? Frind (Fortunatus) I will shewe the very trouth to thee. My little girle that Galla hight had so entrapped mee With feature of hir friendly face and lookes of louyng eye, As in hir crafty cobweb doth Arachne catche the flye. For why hir ruddy cheekes did striue with Corall for their hue: A pretty round and fully face, a seemely sight to viewe. And of hir eyes though one there were that stode in little steede; Yet when I did recompte hir yeares and passyng shape in deede: I did mislyke Dianas face, I sayd hir feature was Not worth a rushe, my Galin did hir blasing beautie passe. Fortunat' Loue (Faustus) blynds the senses sore, it guiles the gazing eyes: It reaues the freedome from the minde of man in monstrous wyse. It doth bewitch our weakned sprites. I verily suppose Some Hellishe Impe doth force this fire and fowly ouerthrowes And out of hooke doth heaue our harts: Loue is not as they say A heauenly God, but bitter gall, and errour from the way. Faustus Besides I had no hope at all my wisshed good to gayne: Though she (good heart) did rue my case, and pitied Faustus payne, And by hir becks, &amp; wanton wyncks hir flame appeared playne For what soeuer way she went (a cruell canckred mate) Hir married Sister hir ensude and followde Gallas gate. The hard and churlish Mother eke vpon the Wench did watch: Eche thing did hinder myne intent. Euen as the Cat to catch The pretty, perte, &amp; prickeard Mouse obserues with earnest eye The clouen cranie, and the beast on bacon flitche doth prie Fortunat' The porred paunch and stuffed maw commendeth fasting much: And they that are not dry, at those that long for lycour grutche. Faustus Twas time with crooked sythe to sheare the corne that grewe in fielde, The Barly all about the landes a golden gleame did yelde. The Mother (as the custome is) came with hir Daughters both, To gather vp the shatered sheaues which reaper ouergoth. For she wiste nothing of our Loue, or made as though she had Not knowen a white therof: I thinke she was not halfe so made But that she found it well ynough, and did dissemble sore: For she in deede (I stand assurde) had vnderstoode before Hir daughter had a Leueret tane in paune of my good will: A payre of stocke Dooues eke she had to kepe or else to kill. Fortunat' The w?t of wealth good nurture marrs the poore is prone to fall: He slydes into the snare of sinne and is to vices thrall. Faustus The virgin gathering vp hir grips, came after me a pace, With open breast and naked foote and sleeuelesse armes, in case As fittest was for scorching heate and sommers scalding blase, With wreathes bough about hir brows to kepe hir beauty bright: For cause the heate wil hurt the hue and make it swarth to sight, In sorte that Louers neuer will conceiue therof delight. And euer as she did approche my shattred sheafe I shooke: And as from out my fist it fell that vp my Minion tooke. For women neyther can conceale their griefs and wasting gleede, Nor conquer cares, ne yet defer the same till time of neede: Such lightnesse rayns in th? by kind as out it shall with speede. Fortunat' Who so doth loue is light God wotte, not womankinde alone, But very they that deemed are to sitte in Pallas throne, And wisedoms gaudy garland weare about their tryed hed: Yea those of poudred purple that and Senate robes are sped. Whom I in stately sorte haue seene like Royall Kings to walke, And earst in proud presumptuous sorte about the streates to stalke. And thou perhaps affectiond so werte madder of the twayne, And lighter eke: thou shattredst corne, she tooke it vp agayne. Thou gau'st y? graine y? she receiu'd, I pray thee tell me now Which was the wysest of the both, the littell trull or thou? Speake on, for talke is it that must dryue sleepe from heauy brow. Faustus The angry Beldam looking backe with shriueled visage prates, And cride why (Galla) whither goest? why doest thou leaue thy mates? Come hither (Galla) here among the Alder boughes I haue Founde out a pleasant shady plotte from Phœbus flames to saue Our ouerchaufed limmes with heate, the whisling ayre doth cause The trembling leaues to make a noyse, tis beste here right to pause. O hatefull words to Faustus eares: go gentle winds I pray And beare (quod I) with nymble gale this curssed sounde away. If any Shepherd bring his flocke into a fertile vayne, And will not let them feede their fill but dryue them backe agayne, Or hauyng fedde, will stay the streame and neuer let them drinke, But force them to forgoe the floud: wouldst thou not surely thinke That man to be a monster fell and natures cruell foe, And stony hearted that could vse his sielly cattle soe? That voyce to me more griefull was than Iunos husbands threats, Wh? down he flings his flasshing flaks, and earth with Imber beats. I would not, but I could not choose but backward cast myne eye: And Galla looking vnder brow, gan out of hand reply. She bent hir friendly blincks as fast, and rold hir eyes aside: Which by and by the chiding Dame by spitefull fortune spide. And call'd vpon the wanton Wench: but Galla bent the more To worke, refusde to lend an eare to hir that chid so sore. As she with foote pursude my pace, so did she eke in hart: Then I full like a craftie childe, (for Loue ministers art And doth instructe his thrals with dole) would often sing a song, And often on the Reapers crie, and haruest folks among. A crafty cloake to make the Dame and wedded Sister leeue That Galla to theyr cleping cries no eare at all did geeue. With sythe I shore adoun the briers, for that I would be sure The pricks to Gallas tender feete no domage should procure. Fortunat' Who so doth loue (no doubt) is slaue and follows (like a thrall Inchaynde) his chosen Maistresse foote till yoke his necke do gall. Sweete blowes to beare he is compeld vpon his beastly corse, He bides the goade, and like an Oxe doth drawe the plough perforce. Faustus And thou as far as I can learne, haste felte Cupidos darte. Fortunat' Tushe tys a common euill, who hath not played some frantike parte? Faustus This paynfull pleasure of the mind, this sugred venom grewe From day to day to more and more, more cruell twas to viewe. Euen as the heate of Phœbus flames augment their scortching blast And partching powre fr? lesse to more, till nine of clocke be past. I wore agaste lyke one that was of late berefte his wits, Besides my selfe (no doubt) I was, and rackte with furious fits. Unmindfull beast I was become, I tooke no nightly rest: Twas easie eke to know my grief, The browe bewrayes the brest. Which thing as sones my Father spide, more gentle he became Than earste, for that him self had felte the force of Cupids flame. And knew thereof the burden well how heauy twas to beare: Wherfore in courteous sorte he sayde. Sonne Faustus bannishe feare, And tell thy father what thou aylste, and hidden haste in harte: (Unhappy boy) this face declares that thou haste felt the darte Of Loue, come off, and take no shame but tell me how thou fare: Bewraye to me thy pensiue thought that breedes this cutting care. Fortunat' Yea, though the father checke his child and vse a bended browe, His mynd is frindlier than his face, he loues him well ynowe. Faustus I seing that my Sire became so courteous, out of hand Confest the matter, and declarde how thoe the case did stand. I crau'd his helpe, he straight behight that he would do his best: And so (or eare the winter frost with glare the ground opprest) The kinsfolk and the Father had betrothde the Mayd to mee. But she and I could neuer deale alone, but some would see And warely watch what coyle we kept: I was a Tantal right, I stode amyd the water, but I could not drinke a whit. O Lord how often leauing plough and Oxen all alone, When she was sole at home, haue I vnto hir mothers gone? I would deuise excuses store, the plough tayle, or the yoake, The share, y? chaynes, y? spittestaffe eke my subtill craft to cloake. And all at Mother lawes I fette, I could not want a iotte, But yet (good We?ch) hir company I could not haue God wotte. I was not slack to doe my due, to fish, to foule, to hunte: I thoe began and practisde feates that I of yore was wonte. What soeuer was my lucke to catche, what game so ere I kilde, To mother lawes I bore, and was surmisde a courteous childe. At midnight once (as promis was betwixte the Wench and mee) I came vnto hir Mothers house, in hope to had some glee: The Dogges (not sleepy then) at dore some theefe surmisde to bee. With open iawes on me they ranne, I leapte a hedge in hast. And so with much adoe escapde the curssed Curres at last: With such deuises all the colde and Winter time we past, The Spring was come, y? groues were greene, the vine began to spread: The ploughman Barly gan to sow, for Wheat had taken head. Lamperydes those glistring foules with glowing wings did flie, Which did declare to husbandmen that haruest tyme was nie. Behold, the mariage daye was come, a wedded wight I was: What neede so many words? at night to bed in post we passe. A wisshed time to both God wotte, my Barke with blessed blast And merrie gale of winde vnto the hauen came at last. Then with a slaughtred Oxe two days we kepte a solemne feast, And vnderneath a spreading tree the tables were addrest. Oenophilus was there, on whom full fraught with Bacchus wares And making sporte, with willing eyes the whole assemble stares. With pipe was Tonius eke at hand, who after meate to showe His skill, the paynted bagpipe raught, and gan theron to blowe. His alie cheekes with blasting breath full wide he made to stroute, When he began to puffe the pipe, he stared all aboute, And lifted vp his bittle browes, and from his lungs full oft, He drew his winde to fill the bagge, that being stuffed toft, And broosed with his elbow downe, did yelde his sounde aloft. With finger frisking here and there, as he was piping aye: He call'd the youth from table, and inuited them to play, And hoppe about the open streetes, and daunce away the day. There are since that three winters past, fourth Sommer comes in place: I see if any good day there bee, it flies away apace. Is nothing pleasant in this worlde but passeth by in hast: But hatefull happes and vilest things we see doe longest last. Fortunat' O Fauste, doest see? to yonder vine, the flocke doth go with speede, Wherfore least we be taxed sore, tis time to trudge in deede. The .ij. Egloge entituled FORTVNATVS. The Argument. The pranks that Padus playde in breaking downe his bounds, And how he had dismayde men, shepe, and pasture grounds, His Faustus tale to quite, here Fortunatus gan: And after to recite the fonde affects of man. Of mad Amyntas loue and passing rage to tell, For other mens behoue this zealous shepheard fell. The speakers names. Faustus. Fortunatus. Faustus How hapt (my fr?d) you com so late? a weeke is past and gone: What bred thy stay? annoyes thy shepe the soyle they feede vpon? Fortunat' O Faustus, Pade the floud that fletes and runnes alongst our grounds Was woxen egall with the banks: it had so past his bounds, That we not forcyng on our flocks, for priuate profits sake And common safetie were constraynde both day and night to make A Bay to beate the waters backe and cause them to recoyle, For feare lest Padus wold haue drownd and ouerflowne our soyle. Faustus Yea Padus sundry times when he doth swell aboue his banks, (As Tityrus can witnesse well) playes many spitefull pranks. Fortunat' Euen as thou sayst, perhaps he doth, when out of meane and tyme He boyles by force of Sommer blase, and boue the banke doth clyme. But now the yeare requires the same, for from the frosty hills The Winter snow descendeth downe: The Mount with water fills The slacked flouds, and doth discharge him selfe: the floud as fast Conuayes his burden and the waues to gultching Seas doth cast. They play the part that men are wont: for when the heauy packe, Doth pinche our limmes, we cast it on our needy neighbours backe. Fortunat' But now the chanell hath reuokde his spoutyng spring agayne. Faustus O Fortunatus (wonder tis and monstrous thing to sayne) Though Padus doe decrease, our lake with greater sourge doth swell: The Citie swimmes aloft the streame, a straungie tale to tell. The vaultes and sellars ditches are, in whirries men resort Unto the barrells, drawers haue a ioily glee and sport, To goe by water with their Jacks and fetche the wyne away By bottels full, that earst full drie in secrete sellar lay. On Townish men (though happy they appeare to open sight) Yet many times vnhappy haps, and cruell chaunces light. Fortunat' From euery pleasure doth aryse displeasure in the ende: And aye from euery blessed happe doth balefull lucke depende. Faustus Thus much of Padus hath ben tolde, now let's recite our Loue: Since friendly Venus thervnto in eche respect doth moue. The weather is full warme we see, the soyle is greene to viewe: The foules about the field do syng, now euery thing doth mewe, And shiftes his rustie winter robe. Fortunat' Thou haste in shepheards verse Declarde thy loue, but I will gyn anothers to reherse, (A shepherd wh? thou knowst full wel) to make it playne in sight What force there rests in Venus flame, and shewe hir stately might. Amyntas poore (God watte) and borne vnluckie vnder signe: Six calues of egall age possest, and had as many kine. Whome as he draue to pasture with a Bull that father was To all the hierd: It was his chaunce by Coytus to passe. A place where Myncius with his cleare and siluer chanell flowes And swiftly all the grassy soyle and meadowes ouergoes. A Castell new with battled walls there faceth on the floode: High raysed vp that Coyte hight, and on the marishe stoode. Here resting him by Riuers side where grew a goodly vine, That w? his boughs did shade y? b?ks and waters passing fine, He stayde to catth the gliding Fish with baited hooke and line. Twas Haruest time, y? scorching beams of scalding Phœbus rayes Had singde the soyle, the Nightingale had layde aside hir layes. The ground was withred in such wyse as neither flocke coulde feede Theron by day, nor deawe was left for Grassehoppers at neede, By night to moist their crikyng chaps. Here whylst he spent the tyde About the Riuer, and this fonde and vayne deuise applyde. The Bull first vexed with the Waspe, and next with curres they say, And last by filching Souldiers meane was quite conuayde away, Not to be found in field. Which when the Boy had vnderstoode, He gat hym to a Mountayne by and cried out a good For Bull vnhaply lost of late, and all the countrey sought With greedy gazing eye. But when he sawe it booted nought And that his payne could not preuaile: his bended Bowe he tooke, And painted Quiuer full of shafts and for his beast gan looke Through woods wher was no haunted path, through euery flock &amp; fold, Through pastures eke to see where he his Bullocke might behold. About Benacus bankes he went, and Mountes with Oliue tree Beset, and places where both Figge and Uine was greene to see. At length a haughtie hill he hent, where did a Chappell stande Of Sulphur, and from thence he cast his eies about the lande, And ouerviewde Benacus bounds, and all the countrey rounde, To see where in that coast there were his Bullock to be founde. It was Sainct Peters day by course and custome of the yere, The youth of euery village by, at after noone was there: And vnderneath a greenysh Elme that shadowed all the soyle, At sounde of pleasant countrey pipe they dauncde, and kept a coyle. Faustus The country Cloines can not be tamde by any kinde of arte, Unquiet they delight in sweate: when Priest hath done his parte, And mornyng Prayers ended are, the Holy day (when all Should ceasse from toyle) impaci?t they of rest and hunger, fall To fillyng of their greedy mawes and tossyng of the cup: And hye to daunce, as soone as myn- streil gyns to pype it vp: They treade it tricksie vnder tree, one skippes as he were mad, An other iumpes as twere an Oxe vnto the Aultar lad. The sacred soyle (that synne it were to turne with toyling share, And cut with crooked culter) they can not endure to spare: But friske theron like fr?tike fooles vnwieldy wights (God wot) With leaden legs and heauy heeles about the Churchyarde trot. And all the day do crie and laugh, and lay their lips to pot. Fortunat' Thou dolt, why dost thou chat of this? thy selfe a rustike borne: The maners of the countrey Cloines, and rustike route doest scorne. Thou dost thy self c?demne withall, thou art thy proper foe. Faustus Tushe of Amyntas let vs chat, let all these matters go. I spake it but in sporte (my friende) I trust you take it so. He stayde, and leaning gaynst his staffe ymade of Acer tree, Did stint from trauaile till the heate might somwhat swaged bee. O most vnhappy haplesse youth, in shade a greater flash Will seaze thy corps: shut vp thine eyes least whilst Diana wash Hir louely limmes in siluer streame thou naked hir espie: Or lende a listning eare vnto the Syrens when they crie. Thy lucke with Narcisce heauy lore, may well compared bee: For whilst in Well he sought to slake his thirst, the more was hee (Unlucky lad) with drought attachde: so whilst thou doest deuise This outward heate to flee, an in- warde flame doth thee surprise. How much had better bene (I pray) and happier for thee, (Unlesse the fatall Gods would had thy destnie so to bee) To thy remainder flocke in fielde to haue returned backe, And kepte thy Kye, and let alone the Bull that was a lacke: And taken in good part the losse of that one beast alone, Than thus, in seeking nought to finde thy selfe to haue forgone. Faustus Oh Friende, who is not wise become when things are at the wurst? Tis naught to giue aduise in fine that should bene had at furst. The counsell that comes after all thyngs are dispatcht at last, Is like a showre of rayne that falls when sowing time is past. Fortunat' Among the rest of all the route a passing proper Lasse, A white haird trull of twenty yeares or neere aboute there was: In stature passyng all the rest, a gallant Girle for hewe: To be c?pard with Townish Nimphs so faire she was to viewe. Hir forhead cloth with gold was purlde a little here and theare: With copper claspe about hir necke a kerchiefe did she weare. That reached to hir breast and paps: the Wench about hir wast, A gallant gaudy ribande had that girte hir body fast. In Peticote of countrey stuffe Mockadoe like, she goes: Twas plaited braue, y? length was such it hoong nie to hir toes. As soone as hir the youth had spide, he perisht by and by: By sight he sucked in the flame, and meane of wanton eye: He swallowde vp the blinding fyre, and in his belly plast The coles that neither waues could qu?ch nor rainie imber wast, No not inch?tm?ts, witches words, it cloong so close and fast. Forgetful he of former flocke, and damage done with waues, Was all inraged with this flash, at night he nought but raues. The season that for quiet sleepe by nature poynted was, In bitter plaintes and cruell cries, this burning Boy did passe. I sundry times for pities sake his growing flame to stay, And stop the frantike furie, would to hym full often say: O lamentable lad, what God hath forcde thee thus to fare? But sure it was no worke of Gods that bred this bitter care. Nay rather twas the cruelst impe, and spitefulst fiende of hell, Of those with Lucifer that from the skies to dungeon fell, That nine dayes space were tumbling downe: I pray thee make me show And call to mynde where euer yet thou any man dydst know By foolish loue aduauncde to wealth, or any office borne: Or raisde by meanes therof his house, or stufft his barnes with corne? Dydst euer any knowe that hath therby enlargde his bounds: Increaste his flocke, or for his hierd, ygotten fruitful grounds? Among so many countreys tell me, if thou heardst of one, At any tyme through all the earth I thinke was neuer none. There are that to their bloudy boordes our crushed bodies beare, And butcherlike (with greedy teeth) our rented corses teare. There are, I say, whom spitefull fiends vnto suche practise dryue: Yet is there no such kynde of men so cruell here alyue: No countrey is so barbarous, is none so sauage seckte, As doth not hate the womans loue and fansies fonde reiecte. Thence brawles ar bred, th?ce chidings come, thence broiling warre &amp; strife Yea often eke with sheading bloud the cruell losse of life. By meanes therof are Cities sackt, and Bulwarks beate to grounde: Moreouer Lawes and sacred Bookes in yron chaines ybounde, Forbid and giue vs charge to flee in any case this Loue: With words expresly Cupide they and all his toyes disproue. Amyntas had no sooner heard the name of Lawes rehearst, But aunswered (for in Citie he a Boy was fostred earst) Thou goest about to farre surmount by giuing this aduise The Catos both, and to be thought both circumspect and wise. This errour and this madnesse beares eche where a cruell swaye: Man flattreth with him self, and would be counted crafty, aye A creature able to forsee: yet many a snare and gin And ditche that he him selfe hath delu'de the Miser falleth in. He first was free, but to his necke him selfe did frame the yoke: In seruile chaine him selfe he bounde, and bands of freedome broke. So weightie are those Lawes (my selfe haue seene the Bookes ere this) As neither predecessours, nor our selues can kepe ywis: Nor aftercommers shall obserue the meanyng of the same. Behold the foolish wit of man, that thinkes such feate to frame, As to the heauens to aspire: and hopes at length to get Among the glistryng starres aloft a stately roome and seate. Perhaps when life is lost, he shall into a foule conuarte: And then his feathred soule with wyngs to welkin shall departe. And then (quod I) what brawle is this? since God dyd so deuise The lawes, twere fowle offence for m? his statutes to despise. Faustus These are debates of great affaires and weighty things in deede. Fortunat' Wott'st thou what kind of m? I was? though ragged be my weede, And I a rustike now to see: then both in force and mynde And lookes, I was a roysting lad. Thou shouldst not lightly fynde A shepeheard to be matchte with me. Faustus And yet if bolte vpright Thou stalke with countnance cast aloft thou wilt appeare in sight, A second Marius to be: let Barbar shaue thy face With razer, and in countenance thou wilt matche with Carbos grace. Fortunat' Amyntas would like aunswer make when I his follie blamde: But to proceede: when God had man in perfect figure framde, He did repine therat and thought the pleasures he allowde Too passing were: and did restrayne our lust with law, and bowde Our Rebell minds with new decrees: as Horsemen vse to tie Theyr iades with brakes about y? iawes for feare they goe awrie. Herein Loue maks me shew my minde, and fansie freely tell: Who so debarres his wife to goe in common doth not well, But enuious may accompted be. But yet this spitefull hate The cloake of honest custome doth in some respect abate. For whilst ech man vnto him self (not forcing common good) Reseru'd his priuate ioyes, and to his marriage bargain stood. A common custome is incrochte that Honestie is hight, Good fayth to make such pieuish lawes twas mad and foolish spight. A hatefull thing is Loue (God wotte) and pleasure spitefull eke. Then I no longer daring to the Youth athwarte to speake, Shooke of the raging wanton Boy that seemde berefte of sense: And on my former voyage I eftsone departed thence. Faustus Seest how this vile Affection fonde our inwarde eyes of mynd Shutts vp in such despiteous sorte, and makes vs men so blinde, As headlong we to errors runns and to deceiptfull snare: Till tyme we bee in wilfull trappe and nipt with cutting care? Fortunat' Oh, dost thou see (frend Faustus) how the pitchy cloudes vpon Mount Baldus to a cluster goe, and ioyne them selues in one? It hayles, for feare our cattell bee dispersed, let's bee gone. The .iij. Egloge entituled FAVSTVS. The Argument. The Tylmans wearye toyle and troublous life he splayes: And laste Amyntas cruell foyle by franticke Loue bewrayes. The speakers names. Faustus. Fortunatus. Faustus The hayle (my friend) from Baldus mount that yesterdaye did fall (We thank the Gods, y? saue our corn) anoyde vs nought at all. But Harculus reported hath and bruted here a fame: That in the coast was much a doe from whence he lately came. Verona fieldes were pestred sore, the cattell with the folde: The Shepecots &amp; the Barnes the haile (as he half weeping tolde) Hath ouerwhelmde &amp; layd on ground, and in such sorte defast: As all good hope that husbands had is quite berefte and past. For Cattle is the onely wealth that Country men enioy, And Pasture ground that subiect is to this and like anoy. The Citizens haue heaped hoords and coffers full of pence: That safely vnder locke do lurke and neede no other fence. No hayle can hurt, no force of frost theyr coffred coyne can marre: No crusshing yse, nor stormy cloudes that in the Welkin warre. I wote not who doth rule the winds, and beares the swinging swaye Among the fell tempestuous Skyes: I wote not what to saye. I know not, no nor though I did, that knowledge would suffise: I dare to speak. But what? shall I for such an enterprise Be here aliue tormented thus? if Gods (as men reporte) The Skies do gouerne from aboue and rule in such a sorte: I thinke they force not on the paynes and troublous toyles of man. See how with dayly sweate of brow we get as wel's we can A slender liuing (God he knowes) behold what cruell paynes The sielly Shepherd for his flocke, his babes and spouse sustaynes. With too much heate in S?mer cloyde, in Winter nipte with colde: The Raynie dayes vpon the ground we sleepe in Shepecots olde. And eyther thousand mischiefs of the soyle our cattell spill: Or Cooth, and dayly vile disease and thousand daungers kill. The filtching Theefe doth watch y? fold, the Woulfe doth lye in wayte: The Souldier eke that far excels the Woulfe for such deceyte. Yea though with dayly trade and toyle our hands well hardened be, And full of knobby hils our fistes, though visage swart to see, Though staring bee the beard to view and shryu'led eke the skyn: One showre of hayl with sodayn whish makes all not worth a pyn. And this by Gods themselues is done, to whom we Shepheards wee Do crouche at sacred Altar stone with twyfold bended knee, and offer holly candles vp. I wote not what this Pietie and Clemency doth meane, That sielly vs poore Sepheards spoyles of all our substance cleane, And wraps vs in a thousand ylls that thincke no hurt at all. Faustus Oh (Fortunatus) our offence procures these plages to fall. And light vpon our hatefull heads that well deserue the same: The iudgement of our God is iust, he not deserueth blame. Fortuna. What heynous fact of ours I pray? did wee his death conspire? Faustus For brawles, thefte, anger, baudy life, and lies we haue this hyre. Fortunat' What haue the good deserued then? all are not ill alyke: Yet all at once with egall scourge the hatefull Hag doth stryke. Faustus Oh vyle offence, so euill to thincke of God is heynous cryme: Wherfore omitting needlesse things not to be knowen, in tyme, Amyntas troubles let's repeate and cares endurde of olde, Which wee of force by triall know, let them I say be tolde Afreshe. For Loue a practise is full common now a dayes: A dayly trade which ouermuch the tender youth assayes. Fortunat' Friend, mourning, &amp; such like affects do ouerthrow the hart, And plages the mynd: hee tels a wo- full tale that tasteth smarte. Faustus Well may a man debate of things as state and time require, But not of such as hee ne knewe: So Cosmas did aspire To be accompted wise and graue. Fortuna. Thou doest (friend Faustus) well And wisely: wherfore let's begin well knowen Loues to tell. Remaynes of good Amyntas rage and latter fate to rue, And that vnhappy chaunce of his with bitter teares pursue. Narratio I sawe, as I by fortune past eftsone that way agayne, The man inradge: and taking ruth of sielly Louers payne, Bespake him as I earst had done. O wilfull wight (quod I) That with this fatall venom vyle besotted so doest lie, Of whom the people haue their talke and babble euery day, Hast thou not yet putte fansies fonde and folish thought away? But buried deepe in Loue dost lie? what? wilt thou spoyle both thee And thyne, thy Cattell and thy Coote as earst did Sampson hee That Gyant huge that halde the house and roofe vpon his hed? When crooked lymping age shall come and braue Iuuenta fled, (If Fates allow thee olde to bee) who will relieue thee than Poore, idle, drousie, senselesse wight, and feeble forcelesse man, All these (vnlesse vntimely death preuente) with Age will growe. Go to, hast home, be ware and wise, and whither thou dost goe Take heede, &amp; shunne the place where hurt may fortune to arise: Be ware (I say) thy future state foresee with carefull eyes. Discerne the path thou mindst to pace, and fixe thou fast in minde That man in womans pleasures and delights is not assinde To wast away his youthfull Prime. For why the foolish toy And wicked lust of wanton Loue doth tender age annoy. Euen I that Cattell haue good store and milke and cheese ynow, Lyue hardly, and do weare away the world with sweate of brow And much adoe God wote, For why our fields did fayle of late, Such neede doth raygne in euery place we are at beggars state. So many heauy happes we haue, such mischiefs dayly light, Such crabbed lucke as all the world is now in piteous plight. Giue eare to things not heard alone or spred by bruted fame, Nor many yeares agoe betyde, my self haue seene the same: And at this day do dayly viewe, the proufe doth now appeare. As custome is, in Month of May I earst my Sheepe did sheare, And three score pounds of passing wooll betyme to sale did sette: But now a dayes I thought alike like gaynes therby to gette, And scarce could kepe my flock aliue and Winter fodder bie, In frost and snow the cruell wante of pasture to supplie. Oh Lord (Amyntas) how my folke shall lyue I know not I. Who so doth loue, vnto his Lasse must many presents sende: But thou whom scarce a house to dwel would cruell Fortune lende: Where day &amp; night is want of wealth and lacke of golden fee: How canst thou shift to send thy Trull ought that may gratefull bee? Eare this suffisde vnto a Mayde ten appels gay to bring, A Garland freshe of fragrant floures, A Neast of byrdes to syng. I knew when in as great a price the countrie maydes did holde A Garland as a better gyfte: but now from grasse to golde They are ascended, Loue is now become a stately thing: The auncient custome is decayde new lawes do dayly spring As touching trade of greedy Loue, they gape for greater gayne. With angry brow and lowring looke repleate with foule disdayne To me perswading thus bespake Amyntas. Friend (quod hee) Friend Fortunatus, if thou long to purchase ease to mee And wisshed comfort to reduce, allow me that I Loue: That onely thing my crankred griefe and gripings may remoue. The rest thou babblest torments are, this furie wil not stinte Nor rooted be from out my heart. Within my breast the printe And Image of the Uirgin sits. With me shee soiournes aye: With me shee goes &amp; makes retourne, when I retourne by daye. At night with me shee lodgeth eke and sleepes in self same bed. She hath so seazde vpon my bones, my marrow, heart, and hed, As neuer may she well departe till lyfe these lymmes hath fled. And as, what tyme a tender slippe cutte from a forraine tree Is grafte into another stocke their natures ioyned bee, And so by growth become as one: euen so the Uirgins grace And Image of hir comely looke and Idol of hir face Was planted deepe within my brest, our harts became as one, Both one our mynds, the difference twixt hir and me was none. One sense, one soule did serue vs both our lymmes so lincked were. Oh happy I, if when my corse shall deade be plac'd on Bere, And fatall Sisters shrid my twist and finger close myne eye, I might twixt those hir lilly armes and pappes in bosome lye: With heauy hed when soule were past and liuely line ycutte, That she these dying eyes of mine mougth with hir finger shutte. And might with shrill and doleful voyce beweepe my heauy fate: And poure hir christall teares adowne for losse of louing mate. Wher to the blessed Fields that are alloted to the good I after life do passe: or forcde downe to the Stygian flood And fiery streame of Phlegeton those freatting fitts abyde: Mee neyther payne withouten thee nor pleasure shall betyde. O Dryads, and yea sacred Nimphs of floures that haue the care, O Sire Syluanus that doest rule where pleasant arbours are: I pray you garde amyd your mounts and shady vales belowe The sweete and smellyng floures that within your circuits growe, (The beautie of the Country fields and queachy Groues we haue) Do hedge your bo?ds fr? feeding flocks the floury soyle to saue. Reserue (I pray you) them tyll neede to decke the Herse withall Of my sweete wench wh? she by stroke of dreadfull death shall fall. Then, then let all y? ground be strowde, let garlands then be plide: At tyme of death and buriall of my Loue hir Herse to hide. Pierides the pensiue Nimphes at hand shall then be preste, With weeping eyes lamenting of the Graue so gayly dreste. And shall insculpe these wofull words vpon the Marble stone, Of after comers to be read when we are past and gone. Here buryed lyes a Lasse that wanted nought at all Saue that she cruell was, a sacred Saynt to call. Oh Uirgin if so great a fire did burn within thy bones By thousand Scyllas and as ma- ny Charybds I at ones Would swym to thee to breed thy ease: thou feller than a snake Dost flee thy friend. But what neede I so much adoe to make? And blame y? wight? she knows me not. No doubt if so the mayde Had vnderstanding what I were, she would procure myne ayde. There can not be a brasen breast where doth such feature flow: But yet we muste not ouermuch beleeue the flattring brow. Faustus For often vnder smothest skin doth lurke a cankred minde: And vnder friendly forhead is a hatefull heart to finde. I will goe talke and let hir witte of this my hidden fire. But oh, if she should wrie hir lookes, and barre me my desire: To tears my Christal eyes would soone conuert as you should see, My wofull breast to sobbyng sighes transformed straight would bee. And though she hate me (cruell) aye and flee hir friend apace: Yet me this wasting care will still pursue in euery place. Fare well ye Phisicke artes, for I am not to be recurde: Adiew ye eke to fetche from Hell the soules that are invrde With Magicke verse &amp; Witches call, (vngodly thing to leeue) Farewell ye all that vaynely hope with bootelesse words ye geeue, The steelie mindes of Gods to wrest: for now I see the Skyes Are cruell foes of mine and will not bende for all my cries. Impacient furie drawes me on, it doth me good alone To range the hills, and w?der through the woods and caues vnknowne The doutful dens of dredful Beasts. Him speaking thus I thought And went about with friendly words to wrest, but all for nought. The curelesse wo?d by no means c? to perfect state be brought He myd the silent Night amids the fields would rangle aye: In bushy Launds with waking eyes he walkt at creeke of day. The Wilding was his onely foode, the Crab he vsde to crash: And with a draught of water he his thirstie iawes did wash And was therwith right well content. At length vnhappie Lad When he his many wofull cryes and schritches yelled had, When tearelesse wore his wasted eyes and drie for want of wette, When he with oft reboundyng sobbes his bulke had all to bette: Came gentle Death, and quiet brought to his vnquiet stay. The Carcas dead and brethlesse Corps that there vnterred lay Withouten honor of the graue the Sauage beasts by night, And greedy tyring filthy Foules by day deuoured quight. Faustus Oh murreyn vile and fatall ginne, that with thy venomde darts The bulks of men doest pierce, &amp; poy- sned shafts our mortall harts, And makst vs brutish seeme to sight, no bet than sauage are. What cuppe of Circes, or Calip- so might with this compare? What drench might Stix, or Phleget?, or Furies worsse deuise? O doltes that Loue accompt a God, O blynde and bleared eyes. Is God a Nature hurtfull? No. Where euer he doth wonne, He ruthfull is to man, and doth no yll, of dexter doome. Fortunat' Oh Wofull wretched Boy that in thy tender yeares didst die: What time y? thou wert born what starres bare sway in swinging Skie? What part of welkin wrought thy wo? that didst deserue no yll? What curssed corner of the Heauens did thee vntimely kill? Yet was not all the Heauen thy foe, thou couldst as well as wee With Oaten quill and pleasant pipe make ioily game and glee. Had not this ouer hasty death thy life so soone opprest, Thou hadst deseru'de Pernassus crowne and Laurell with the best. No better Tytirus (belou'de of his Alexis) roong Of cruell fight, of dreadfull warre, and of his tillage soong Than thou: for why thy timely ripe capacitie was knowne To vs, it did presage what fruite in time thou wouldst haue sowne. No vulgar triall of thy skill, and towarde witte was seene: It well declarde if thou hadst liude what thou wouldst after bene. Now moughtst thou ben acc?pted thou the glory and the praise Of all our soyle, not such a one did liue in these our dayes. Thee Padus, and with weeping browes our Myncius did lament, Yea Nimphs th?selues: as Hebrus earst for Orpheus was bedrent With trickling showrs of falling tears. The maister shepheards all Did rue thy death as Daphnis earst was pitied for his fall. Thee all the Champion fields aboute, both hill and vale doe crie: And all the Pasture grounds did lift their clamours to the skie. O Shepheardes with sweete smellyng floures bestrow his bitter graue: The song of Priest and fuming Cense, (Oh, yearely) let him haue. Ye Poets eke eternall rest wish to his graued Ghost. Faustus But what? (Amyntas) thou doest lodge in farre a better coast Than wee, in Fields for happy soules allotted thou doest wonne: And we below in Earth bewaile thy Clipse of life be gonne. Fortunat' I knew we should lament to day, for yesternight I sawe Such cruell sights amid my sleepe, as bred my present awe. But now you see the night is come, descending of the Sunne In Cloude declares y? showrs at h?d, wherfore tis time to runne To fold our flock. And Faustus thus my wofull Tale is done. The .iiij.

Let neuer honest Lucrece lowre, let no good Grisell grutch: For neither Alphus here, nor I the modest matrone toutch. We nippe the cruell cankred crue with beautie that allure, And hauing thralde the miser, seeke no salue his sore to cure: But take delight with scornefull chere and face of foule disdaine Like Vipers vile to sowe the seedes of our fast springing payne. Those, those ar thei that M?tu? means those Alphus doth declare: And I (the Poet to explane) those Dames no whit will spare. The speakers names. Alphus. Ianus. Alphus. More leane (Oh Ianus) seemes thy Goate than ere he was of yore: For lusty he his hornes ere this into the Welkin bore. But grouelyng now on ground he lies with lyther lolling eares, He smelles to grasse, to touch the herbs at length of lips he feares. Ianus. He droupes, and of his drouping doth a pleasant iest arise: Which loke how oft I mind, doth make me laugh with smyling eyes. As yet it is not spread abroade, but when the brute is blowne, And that through euery countrey is this pleasant story knowne: Then all y? world wil laugh therat Alphus. (O Ianus) thou ere this Werte wont to tell a mery iest in merriest wise ywis, And with a sweete delighting voyce: Wherfore I pray thee now Declare me why the Goat doth droupe, and tell how fell it how? Ianus. God is my iudge twas neuer faynde of me, but done in dede, And lately too: But shall I tell the tale withouten meede? And chatte for nought &amp; wast my wind? Nay, what wilt giue to mee? What shall I haue for telling of this iest beglarde with glee? Alphus. O friende, when so the Nightingale (that Philomela hight) Hath built hir nest, and sits a broode I will thy trauaile quight. Ianus. Who so doth make such rash behests by dayly proufe we see Performes not pacted promise, but his touch is wont to flee. Alphus. Nay, who so lends such light beliefe distrust doth beare in breast. But for you shall be sure that I nill play the guilefull guest, Take here a pledge of promise made and bargaine carst by mee: Take here (I say) from out my case two Flights that farre will flee. Ianus. I will begun: O sacred Nimphs Parnasides I pray Do moue your iawes, &amp; guide my tong that I may well display My welbeloued Goates mishap and misaduenture fell: And gra?t that Alphus Nightingale may hatche hir yonglings well That I may haue that he behight for this good tale I tell. Narratio With pennie I a Lad did hire my little flocke to keepe: I gaue him charge and ouersight of all my fleezie sheepe. He kepte both Kids and females eke, and Ramme goates too with care: And ouerlook'd my flocke that I the Stripling could not spare. Till time at last by Fortune he a pretty Mayden sawe, (That hither came of purpose bent at water place to drawe Such water as suffisde hir tourne) and liked hir so well Is he (good Boy) by feature of hir face to fansie fell. And from that tyme and dolefull day so dumpish he became, As lesse regarde he had of sheepe, (the greater was his shame) Lesse forced he since that the foldes and quight bereft of witte He seemde: So deepe within his brest the Uirgins shape did sitte. When hee on bed to quiet nap his weary limmes did lay: Where sleeping he or waking were twas very harde to say. For when he was wide waking he such frantike coyle would keepe, As though (his reason quite bereft) his wittes were gone to sleepe. So dreamyng was this Boy to sight, so lumpishe woxe the Lad: In sort, that gazers on surmisde that he no senses had. This Boy bent to refresh (I say) his ouertyred mynde With sportyng play, about the hornes with twig this Goate did bynde Among the thickest of the briers and bushy Laundes belowe: And so to passe away the time away the Boy dyd goe. (And now .iiij. days are past and gone) thus hee the Goate did tie: The strongnesse of the Wyth &amp; hard- nesse of the Hornes to trie. Meanewhile the woods he went about and raungde the bushes rounde, To see where that within the place mought any birds be founde. The Mayde resorted to his thought and vndercrept his heart: The comely countnance of the Trull coulde neuer thence depart, Nor beautie of hir bourly breast his musyng mynde forgoe, The parts not to be namde he rollde within his bulke belowe. Meanewhile the Sunne had lodgde his light, that sielly sotted Mome Unmyndfull of his hamperde beast afielde, came late to home. Amid the night he callde to minde that foolishe fact of his: And thinking to go loose the Goate in all the hast he rise. And whilst with fearefull foote he pac'de through Dampes as darke as Hell, Where lay much chaffe &amp; rotten straw, into a Dyke he fell: A place of purpose made to take the sauage Beasts by night, A hollow vault and dungeon deepe to steepe for any wight Once beyng in to clamber vp. Thus was the Goate by him Fast bo?d with twigs, the Page in pit ycaught and dungeon dim. No Shepheard kept the beasts as then, twas well neere three a clocke: I musde, and went my selfe about and numbred all the flocke. I miss'd the Goate, and maruelde much what of the beast became, I sought about the fields: at last I calde the Boy by name. (I tell but truth) I stode in feare least he by Magike meane And Sorcerie had ben raisde to Skies, and Goate dispatched cleane. For Hags and Witches by report are caught amids the night Much like, and far to Banquets borne quite out of cry and sight. This dreading, I to Pasture grounde did bring my sheepe at last To feede their fills, and whilst that I did wander all agast In irkesome shades and vgglie nookes, and entred in the Groue: I hearde a farre the braying of my Goate, and how he stroue With punching hornes &amp; pushyng pate against the Wyth a good I plainly sawe, and how he bette the Bushe gainst which he stoode. This gastfull thing affrighted me, and monstrous sight to viewe Unlooked for. But when at length my sielly Beast I knew And bolder wore, I went me in among the brakes in hast: With hooke I hewde the br?bles downe and bushy briers at last. As late in euening home I hide, all rounde about the fielde A girnyng route of grinning folkes by fortune I behelde. Approching neerer to the preasse mee eche began to greete As soone's they knew what man I was, and friendly did entreate. Lo here (quod they) O Ianus is a little Lad of thine Tane vp a Woulfe his denne of late a deepe and daungerous Myne. He wandring late about the Dounes did happen (to his payne) Upon this caue, but now both Goate and he be founde agayne. The Goate that had this cruell hap as yet vnlusty is: But yet the foolish Boy of both most frantike is ywis. The Uirgin hearyng that the Lad did loue hir passyng well: Eftsoone as proude as Pecocke wore and with disdayne did swell. And makyng wise she had not wiste the cares he did indure, Pretended honest lyfe the more the striplyng to allure. And to increase hir beautie more she deckes both face and breast In finest wise, and in hir gate hir lookes to ground she keast. Thus Forelike she with simple shewe and seemyng to the eyes, In double breast and subtill heart hir craftie meaning plyes. These are the tricks that women vse, this is the sleightfull ginne: These are the cruell weapons that the myndes of men do winne. Thus hoping he his Gallant girle to conquere at the last, His wages scornde, and plide his loue, and follows hir in hast. Wherfore now leauing Cart &amp; plough and Oxen all alone, To Shepheards toyle I will retourne. Frayle youth (the more the mone) Is vassall to this furie fell and to this folly thrall: It wanders rounde about this coast, and ouerturneth all. Alphus. Lo, see what Witte can not deuise by Fortune comes to thought: O wondrous chaunce, O happy happe that this to mynde hath brought. O famous iest for two months space well able glee to make: Good faith for thee the Nightingale now sitts a broode in brake. But that which thou of subtill sleight of crafty Lasse did syng, What Vmber earst of womans guile hath wrote, to mynde doth bring. Ianus. O tell vs Vmbers merry Uerse, if thou hast ought in store Nowe out withall: they say he wrote a stately style of yore. Alphus. Tis as thou tellst, but for my tale what recompence remaines? What th?ks shal I? what guerdon haue for vndertaken paines? Ianus. Go to, Ill stande to bargayne made kepe thou those dartes of myne. Alphus. O Ianus, whilst I goe behynde that yonder sedge, repine Not thou to driue along my flocke but force them onwarde still, For feare least in my absence they the neighbour Uine do spill. Ianus. O Ramme I say, that for thy hornes the Diuell doest represent, To enter in the Uine thou aye with cankred mynde arte bent. Thou neuer wilt be ware and wise, tyll from thy forhead I With cruell yron for the nones doe reaue thee eyther eye: And make th? leaue that pieuish pate and horned head of thine: Will not a hundred Acres serue but thou must to the vine? Alphus. Oh, now at my retourne I haue reuokte to minde somewhat Of those self things we m?tiond earst, of all I can not chat. But Vmber wyst of erie thing, that man by wysdome knowes: The Skie, y? Stars, y? ground, y? winds, the Sea, the flouds that flowes. The Fo?tayns eke &amp; spouting springs, at Rhodop he hath bene: Epyras fiery mountaynes he and Ossa earst hath sene. The soyle of Fraunce, and Araris, both Rhodan, Tyber, Pade: And out of curious Greeke he hath his Latin myter made. A worthy wight for eyther speach, and skilde in eyther tong, As wel's the best that euer yet hath: Latin verses song. Him specially the lerned Greekes repined sore to see Arcadians, Thrace and Thessalie our Countreyman to bee. His doctrine and his trade of life good Candid followed aye That dwels hereby, he skilfull is he shall declare the waye And ready path to vs: meanewhile let Shephierdes vs assay: With ioylie blast of puffing breath on Oten Pipe to play. But first of all I pray the Nimphs here prest to be in place: But chiefe Polymnya, for they say she hath the goodliest grace. Narratio These Women are a seruile secte, curst, cruell, puft with pride: Reiecting lawes, refusing meane, from reason wandring wide. They scorne the boundes of better life, extremes are best in price: What they attempt is rashly done and quite without aduice. A Woman eyther not prouoke like Leade full lumpish lies: Or being once stirrde vp, too fast about hir things she hies. Aye Winterlike, a frowning cheare and frostie face she beares: Euen as the Dogge with cruel starre the singed soile that seares. She neuer keepes the golden meane: for eyther passing well She loues thee, or with mortall hate pursues thy ghost to Hell. If graue she couet for to seeme, too grimme becoms hir grace: She powteth then and fiercely frownes. But if with friendly face She long to looke, hir grauitie is banisht out of place, Those lookes demure and Matrone like leude laughter hath in chace. Straight Giglot like she waxeth light, she grins with childish cheare: In smyling brow a Whorish mirth doth shiningly appeare. She sobs, she laughs, right wise she is as franticke as a Hare: Opprest w? tr?bling feare she quakes and yet too much doth dare. She will, she will not, euer so hir thoughtes contrary are. Unconstant, light, vayne, chatting, and a double tong doth beare, Pres?ptuous, threatfull, thirsting blood, disdaynfull erye wheare. Uile, greedy, catching, quareling aye and strouting full of hate: Of light beliefe, and bent to lies, impatient of hir state. A costely charge, to quaffing gyuen, rashe, bitter, iesting, lighte, Ambitious, Soceresse, brothell baude, with supersticion fright, Too laasie, greedy gutted, and to Lechers lust inclynde: Sweet mowthde, venerious, wanton, of too nice and dayntie kynde. To flattry bente and paynting of hir face with forrayne freake: She keepes in cankred hart hir hate till tyme she may awreake And be auenged of hir foe, vnfaythfull thanklesse eake. Malicious, hastie in reuenge, bolde, bedlam, wrangling wight, A rebell, stubborne, stiffe as stake. She takes a greate delight To cast in teeth hir olde good tournes: if any hir accuse Of guyltie crime, with Tragike voyce hir selfe she will excuse. She mumbles to hir self, she stirres debate, she forceth nought Of promise made, she friendship scorns, and euer hath in thought Hir priuate gayne and no mans else: she iestes, she flatters aye She tels thy counsell, and as she thy secretes doth bewray With bitter scoffe she payes thee home, she triflyng newes doth spredde Among the people, and doth adde to euery tale a shredde, And of a hillocke makes a mount. She doth dissemble sore, She makes in wise, and beares in hand and learned hath of yore Untruthes and leasings to deuise, to craft she wants no art: She wots well how to euery chaunce hir countnance to conuart. Man can not well auoyde hir guile, nor shunne hir forely drifts: So many are hir mischeous crafts, so sundry are hir shifts, And subtile sleights hir craft to cloake. Yea and put case that thou With present eye beholde hir feates, yet she with shamelesse brow Will dare excuse committed crimes: by cloaking craft she can And double dealing of the minde delude the Sense of Man. We wotte not how to credit ought that hir reporte doth blow: And yet if she would haue vs thinke that all she sayes is so, We can not but beleeue the same, she driues vs to affie: Hereto examples may persuade. What curssed crime to trie Hath not a Woman had the heart and ventrous hand of yore? Tarpeia to hir countrey foes, (that mortall hatred bore To Romaine state) the Capitoll did yeelde, in hope to haue The Iewels that about the wrests of Souldiers glistred braue. Medea with hir babes bloud imbrued hir beastly handes, Faire Helen thousand Barges brought vnto Ægean sandes. For Minos loue (hir fathers foe) whome Scylla did pursue, She reft the Princes Purple locke, and from hir countrey flewe. Hir Brother beastly Byblis lou'd, with Father Myrrha lay: Semyramis that aged Queene of Babylon (they say) Hir sonne King Ninus out of kinde did fansie (fleshly Dame:) Eriphile at siege of Thebes (to hir eternall shame) For golden Owch betrayde hir Spouse Amphiaraus hight: King Danaus daughters did to death their husbandes in a night. The Thracian Wiues w? cruell cl?bes the Poet Orpheus rent: Pasiphäe that wanton Wench (to worke hir fowle intent) In Mynos absence closde in Cowe, was couerde of a Bull: Hippolit Phædra went about from honest life to pull. Rebecca Isaac did deceiue, and blearde his aged eyes: And hid the sonne that Iacob hight in Goates long hairy flyse. The curssed Deianira gaue vnto hir manly feere The fatall venome, he (good man) did bye the shirt to deere. Hippodame beguylde hir sire, and stopt his vitall breath By matche with Pelops, and procurde therby his hasty death. Lauynia wrought the Troians woe, and bredde a broyle in fielde: Hir Turnus would haue had to wife, Æneas would not yeelde. Achilles chieftaine of the Greekes from battaile Brysis draue: Duke Agamemnon all inragde with Chrysis beautie braue Did freate and fume in furious wise and felt Apollos wrath: And curssed Eue from blessed fieldes mankinde expelled hath. Beleeue me (Shephierdes) for I sweare by Gods that haue the care Of Countrey soyle: If you wil haue your Cattle well to fare, Your Pastures fitte for feeding Flocks and wanting all dysease, If hooe you haue of sheepe, of peace, of life and quiet ease: Abandon all these foolish Girles, let wanton Wenches goe, Do from your sheepcots shift away all Women lesse and moe. Let Thestilis and Phillis walke, beare Galathea grudge: Force you Neera nought at all, let fine Lycoris trudge. Oh, make me showe what woman ere went downe to darksome Hell, And came fr? thence, or tidings brought from such as there do dwell? Eurydice might haue returnde if she had had the wit, And come from shade to sunne againe, to light from lothsome Pit. Proserpine eke whome Pluto stole and had conuayde away, Hir wearie mother Ceres shunnde with griesly King to stay. But good Æneas shapt retowre, and Orpheus did the leeke: Alcydes eke that Champion stout and thrice renowned Greeke. Duke Theseus and the brothers both, of whome one quailes his foes With fight on horssebacke, tother aye on foote to wrestling goes. And our Redeemer, highest GOD, whence life and comforte flowes, Went downe to Hell, and rose againe as all the wordle knowes. These (Shephierds) these are mysteries to be obseru'd of you: By nature Man and kinde is bent all filthie things t'eschue. Infamous places most delight and fansie Womans minde. Euen as the Seaman driuen on the Rockes with waue and winde, Knowes how the daungers to declare vnto his other Mates: So he full well of former happes and future chaunce debates, And tells what Fortune will befal by likelyhode at the least: Whose wasted yeares haue planted wit within his aged breast. If siellie Foules the Eagle flie, if Buckes the net do shunne, If bleaing Lambs auoide the Woulfe, if Diere from Dogge do runne: Then (Shephierd) oh why dost not thou from Womans flattrie flee: And trudge from hir with speedie flight that so anoyeth thee? As ruthfull they as Crocodile, or beast Hyena hight. The viler mischiefe they pretende when to the outward sight They deawe their cheekes w? trickling teares, and vse their sweetest call: Then they conspire thy cruell death (fell Monsters) most of all. O Shephierd shun the Womans looke and flie hir fleering face: For harling nets and hurtfull ginnes are pight in beauties place. Repose no trust in manly force, in prowesse or in might, Trust not Duke Perseus glittring shield that made y? sturdy Knight Of fell Medusas crawling Snakes to byde the vgly sight. Earst many Monsters haue subdude and gastly Giants quelde: Huge Cities sackt, and in their handes whole Seas and Hauens helde. With flowing fieldes and haughty hils that seemde to touch the Skie: And other some haue wonne y? spurres for noble Chiualrie. Yet those that valiantly atchieude and did these feates of fame And conquerde all, a Woman hath (the more these Princes shame) As Captiues caught, &amp; brought to yoke. That Shephierd that was King, And wore the Lions hairy spoile and warrde with wreakefull sling: And eke his sonne that worthy Prince King Salomon by name The sacred Temple (Syon clept) who first of all did frame: And Sampson he whome neuer man could deale withall in fielde, All these (I say) for all their force to Womans yoake did yeelde. Lesse hurtes the fiery flashing flake, lesse raggie Rockes anoy, And lesse the Gleaue that Adam did expell from heauenly ioy: Lesse spoiles the spitefull steely Speare and dreadfull darte of Death, That quite cuts off the line of life and reaues the vitall breath, Than woman doth our daylie foe: who neuer well content With beauties beames y? Nature gaue, doth aye with care inuent A thousand meanes to make it more and fairer to the eyes. A golden glistring Fillet to hir forhead she applies, With Purple hue hir paalie cheekes she paintes and daylie dies. By Arte hir lockes she settes in place and deckes and dils hir pate: By Arte she tempers all hir lookes, by Arte she guides hir gate. She runs before with scudding skips the louing man to lure And bring to place for follie fitte: although she looke demure And giue the nay, with all hir heart she would on him bestow His suite, she striues, but gladly would be conquerde of the foe. A Woman to the Northeast winde may well compared bee, That gathers vp the cloud and straight doth force the same to flee Abrode by guilefull puffe againe and bitter windie blast: So she allures, and then she lowres vpon hir Loue at last. By tryall I that finde it true do will thee to beware (Whilst yet thou mayst) the lothsome tricks that in these Women are. But homely they by nature are, by Arte they waxen braue: By day 'tis all the worke they doe, their dreames thereof they haue. They pluck off haires wher neede requires, they wash, they paint &amp; sleeke: They chamfer, purle, anoint and smooth and practise other leeke. Deceyte they are from toppe to toe, all craft and trifling toyes: All stufft with venome rancke and vile, that gazers on anoyes. Of Glasse she takes hir counsell aye for ought she puts in vre: By viewe thereof she learnes to moue hir lippes and lookes demure. She learnes to craft by gaze of Glasse, to smyle with flattring glose: She wags hir hench that hangs behind and shoulders as she goes. What meanes that bare &amp; naked breast and open clyft a hie That makes the double path betwirt the dangling Dugs to lie? Nought else (good fayth) but for y? force of poyson should oppresse The Sense the more, &amp; Stygian flame within the heart increase. These are the Rocks of retchlesse Age, and Syrts that threaten wracke: These Scyllas and Charybdes are the cordes of Youth to cracke. These are y? Foules that Harpeis hight that with their fylth defile The chamber, parler, boord and streate, and make the temples vile, Pollute the path, the Champion fields, the Sea, the floud, the hill, These gastly Gorgons are that earst in Lybie land did kill, And that with m?strous glowing lookes to Stones did men conuarte, And wrested Nature from hir kinde by cruell curssed Arte. Thus by the way (as you haue heard) the learned Umbers verse Recyted is, and we are they that did the Ryme reherse. Which if you deeme excessiue long, remember that the blame Is in the thing it selfe, the Uerse doth not deserue the same. The Uerse is not so long, as is these Womens franticke fitte. O noble aged famous wight (of whome for worthy witte The boasting Umbria brags &amp; vauntes, and Tyber neighbour place Thereto) 'twas not without desert that Martiall Romaine race Of thee accompted earst so well: The noble Citie knewe Thy passing wit and pleasaunt vaine. The learned Muses rue Both Greekes and Latines thy decease. I wish thy corps in graue With ease to lie, and golden soule in Skies his seate to haue. The .v. Egloge entituled CANDIDVS. The Argument. Siluanus seemes to muse at Poets ydle life: Himselfe not ouer hastie yet by gift to ease their griefe. But Candid (Poet poore) bewailes the present time: Wherin the Learned loathed are, and such as maken Rime. Siluanus wealthie was well storde of stuffe at home: But carefull Candid want of goodes enforcde abrode to rome. But yet for all his toyle and trauayle long sustaynde: For all his learned vaine in Uerse no whit this Poet gaynde. Which makes the man the more gainst wealthie wights to warre: For somewhat he deserude to finde that trauaylde had so farre. The speakers names. Siluanus. Candidus. Siluanus. O Candid, thou ere this didst vse a common trade, With vs to feede thy flocke a fielde and Pipe in pleasaunt shade. To chat in merry wise, and wrestle now and than: But now me thinkes thou art become another kinde of man. As though thou didst both loath the Shephierdes and their soyle: Thou fleest the fieldes, &amp; scornst to sing, a sleepie dumpish droile. Candidus. You that at home haue store of goodly housholde stuffe, Whose Kie haue dangling Udders downe and morning Milke ynouffe: Whose flockes do fill the paile euen to the upper brimme, Whose Hierds do make y? croked Cans with whashing whay to swimme: Whose boordes with Bankets braue and fattie Feastes do reake, In commendation of a Uerse and praise of Poets speake. If ought be well deuisde you giue a chearefull crie: And to the hearing of the same a pleasaunt eare applie. Uaine praise and painted woordes in recompence you giue: Meanewhile y? shepherd hunger sterude, in thirst and colde doth liue. Siluanus. Can he not both attend his flocke, and otherwhile At vacant time make Uerses, and all cankred cares exile? And wast his dayes in sport, and leade his life at lust As best contents his liking minde? Candidus. No (friend) a Shephierd must All laysure time unto his Cattle well implie, Trot out in hast, retourne in poast, and bout his matters hie: Keepe off the barking Woulfe, close vp his flocke in folde, Buie strawe and fodder to sustaine his Beasts from Winter colde: For meate and drinke puruey, no leysure time remaines. A Uerse it is a stately thing and craues a cruell paines, And all the braine (Siluanus) beates, and stirring Senses straines. Both these are weighty woorkes and ouermuch for me: When I haue soong I am full drie, my lippes ypartched be, And no man giues me drinke: some other scoffe a good, And say, me thinks your cloake is thin, your haire grows through your hood: Your hose are crackt at knee, your bearde is bristled sore. Now naked Trees vnuested are, the frostie hils are hore. I chaufe, I sorrow eke, and daylie do disdaine: The cost of needefull cates consumes and weares away my gaine, Both Wooll and Cattle male. We keepe the females aye, But for they fostred are with milke we make nor cheese nor whaye, They drie the strouting Tets. It yrks me of my witte (If any lodge within my Skull) and skill a Uerse to writte. It loathes me of my life this cruell chaunce to see, That none of all the shining Starres is friendly light to me. Thou wottst full well that I for nought these many dayes Haue soong, I wanted fewe good things as then: now Youth decayes, And limping Age is at another kinde of stay Which now encrocheth on apace, it reaues our wealth away. Then strength begins to faile, no lucres hope remaines. Then must we vse our gotten goodes, and wast our coffred gaynes. Wherfore now time requires and bids us looke about: See how the Ant a little beast (I put thee out of doubt) But circumspect and wise, in Sommer drags to Caue And hides the Graine in hole, his life in Winter time to saue, And, least the Corne should sproute and so escape his might, The buried graine with greedy mouth this siellie Beast doth bite. Siluanus. They say there are that knowe what Fortune shall betide By Starres that rule at time of birth, and they do thus decide. The Poets they were wont to Mercure to assigne, And noble Peeres are vnder Ioue whose soueraigne Scepters shine. Them mightie Ioue allowes the Golde and Kingly seate: Mercurius giues those other wit, tong, harpe and Uerses feate. That is thy lotted hap, why doest thou gape for pelfe? God doth dystribute needefull things as he doth see himselfe What is for our auaile: wherefore accept thy share And liue content, resigne the rest to vs that wealthie are. Candidus. Thou riches hast at will, I Uerse and Poets trade: Why crau'st thou then my Uerse, &amp; dost anothers bowndes inuade? Siluanus. I reaue thee not thy Muse, nor ought that Phœbus gaue: But to thy Musicke for to lende an eare, is all I craue. Candidus. Then if thou long so much to heare my pleasaunt voice, (Siluanus) reason is, that with thy wealth I should reioice. Siluanus. He at my wealth doth ioy that loues both me and mine: The spitefull man hates me, and at my welfare doth repine. Candidus. Yea, then as well thou mayst in absence take delight Ynough of this my Muse, and so thy friendship I requite. For Uerses are the feast and iuncket of the eare, Cheese serues to feede the tasting iawes in steade of better cheare. Wherfore if thou desire to feast thine eares with sound: Then set my chaps a worke with cates, for so thou standest bound By loue, and law of God, so pitie doth persuade. God giues not al his giftes to one, but in such sorte hath made His lawes of kinde, that none can finde suffising powre Within him selfe to serue his tourne, but at some needefull howre He standes in want of helpe and of some forraine ayde: And that is it that doth conioyne, and euer yet hath stayde In league of lasting loue all kindes of forraine wightes: The French, the Maure, the Italian, &amp; the worthy Spanish Knightes. Then let vs ioyne yfeare, and lincke at last in one Those starres that at eche others birth and day of being shone. Cause Iupiter to be my faithfull friend at neede, And thou shalt haue Mercurius helpe if he may stande in steede. Thou shalt not want his Hat, his twigge, or Lute to play: Alcydes knot thou shalt commaunde, which fewe can tell the way Or none at all to looze, so doubtfull is the drift: Yea whisking wings &amp; all thy limmes into the Skies to lift. Siluanus. Good faith, me thinks thou telst a vaine and trifling tale: Your ouermany words declare your tong is tipt with Ale. Candidus. You count it vaine that doth your riches wrong a whit. But if to heare my merrie Muse you haue so great delight: Do ease my drousie dumpes, and myst of carefull minde: For Uerses craue a quiet breast and ioyfull heart by kinde. I woxen am of late much like the skirring Kite, Whome cruell colde and hunger cloyes, a slowe vnlustie wight. All scalie is my Skinne, my lippes are passing drie: For lacke of licour at my neede I am at point to die. In stable not a Beast, in cloase no Corne to see: No crosse in pouch, and wouldst y? haue me voide of care to bee? Such Physike doth not serue nor sitting is to ease Me (siellie Miser) of my griefe and gryping fowle dysease. Make merrie me, do cloath my bare and naked bones, Relieue my Age, and thou shalt see me making Uerse atones: I out of hand will sing and pipe in pleasaunt wise. A house that stored is with wealth where trash and treasure lies, Doth cruell cares exile and banish dumpes away. A Sellar full, Foldes stuft with flockes, Pots full as ere they may: A Flaggon full to brimme, as much as it can holde, Barne full, fatte Cattle, and a Pursse puft vp with peysing Golde, These make the merry minde. Then pleasaunt 'tis to wake The Winter nights, and with a sticke at fiers side to make Good sport with streking of the Asshes furrowise: And roast the Chestnutte that yrakt in scalding imber lies. And with an alie Cruse the cruell thirst to quell, And pleasaunt tales among a route of spinning Trulls to tell. For Vergil (by report) Mecœnas bearing sway, The Countrey, Oxen, soyle and eke the Martiall warrs did splay Aloft in lustie tune, and strake with stately Uerse The starry Skies, his Musike did the haughtie Heauens pierce. Good luck and store of wealth allowde him fluent vaine: Us siellie, poore and patched soules the Muses do disdaine. To vs that Gruell suppe with greedy gaping gumme, As leane as rakes, the God of skil, Apollo scornes to come. Siluanus. O friend if hoped hap suffising wealth allowe To me, I will procure release of cares that cloy thee nowe. Candidus. Siluanus would thy will did counteruaile thy might, And thou wert bent as well as thou art able me to quite From present poore estate. I neyther long to haue The fluent wealth of Cosmus, 'tis no silken cloake I craue. No roabe of Purple staine or Die that came from Tyre, Nor costly cates of mighty Kings, nor Bankets I desire. Not Æsops daintie dish or warlike Pallas shielde, Nor battled buildings raised hie that Romaine Nero helde. (I minde it well that I of Vmber learned this) I craue attire and vittailes in a thacched Coate ywis. So that I were assurde of that till life did blinne: Giue me Pythagors homely fare, and Codrus garments thinne. I often times haue had the hap to hit on such That offred haue to me ere this in painted words as much, But nought they did in deede: my hope consistes in thee Alone, and in none other man. If thou once false with mee, Quite off is cut my hope: with Nightingall I may Shut vp my Pipes till next retourne of Spring, and leaue my lay, As one withouten speach: then wil the time to put My weapon on the peast, and watch dischargde, the dore to shutte. Siluanus. O Candid thou at Rome ere this (I know) hast beene: The sacred Senate there thou hast and holie Fathers seene. Where are so many States and store of learned braynes, There may a man enritch him soone, there restes the Poets gaynes. Candidus. No sure, thou art begylde, thou thinkst I long for pelfe: So weenes the Woulfe that other eate the meate he mowthes him selfe. And thou haste this conceyte that other treade the way And crosse the path that thou doest pace, thus doest thou seeme to say. A pittance would suffize, I couet not to flowe: O let me liue withouten care, the Romaine Court I knowe. O (Siluan) what auayles that place so poore a Wight? Augustus long agoe is deade, in dampe or darksome night He woons and stayes in Hell. If Rome do ought expende, Tis trifles, Rome receyues the golde, and woords for ware doth lende. Alas, for now alone at Rome doth money raigne: Dame VERTVE liues a weary life, erilde she bydes the paine. Ech man doth bid vs hope and looke for good at last: We gnawe on Trust, tis slender foode, we were as good to fast. Siluanus. Display some dreadfull fielde, pen actes of woorthie Peeres, Write wreakefull Warrs of wrathfull Kings: repaire to such as steeres And are the stay of Realmes, and wielde the princelie Mace: Thou shalt haue lucke to light on some that pitie will thy case. Candidus. Tush, sooner shall I finde a checke or scoffing taunt: Of Poets men as much accompt as stewes they daylie haunt. Why then (Siluanus) doest thou stirre my chaufed witte? Siluanus. Such filthie wordes to speake it is not for a Poet fitte. Candidus. I can none other choose but very sooth to say: But if thou faine wouldst haue y? truth to be concealde, do stay Thy tong from mouing me, and leaue while things be well. Siluanus. What 'tis not one to stirre to wrath, and good aduice to tell. Candidus. Of counsayle I am storde, my budget is but bare: How should a needy Poet Wars and kingly Campes declare? That hath not once so much good here below the Sunne, As knife to cut his Pipe, and cause the breath by holes to runne? Beholde the handle of my Whittle how it waggs By loosenesse of the pinnes: see howe the edge is all in iaggs And toothed like a sawe: but these are slender things, The lacke of meate and drinke is it that me so vilely wrings. Good counsell somewhat mends the matter when it cooms: But that aduice that fruitelesse is our shaken Senses nooms. It breakes the busie braine, it weakes the wearie witte. For Peeres small friendships to bestow me thinks is nothing fitte: And they do flatte refuse great guerdons to forgoe. Besides our Princes now a dayes accompt of Uerses so, As Borias blast of leaues, with whiffing force that flie: Or Lybicke winde with stormie puffe that on the Seas doth lie. As frost doth force the Uine whome cruell it doth cut. The Besars they their tickling ioyes in sweete delights so put, (Unmindefull of their states) and ydle life imbrace: As Uerses they will none that seeme their vices to deface. Thence flow the wanton Rymes, this makes that Poets nowe Of childish Venus chat so ofte they wotte neare what nor how: Of tauntes and scolding scoffe, of beastly bellie cheare, Of sluggish trade, infamous actes, which too reprochfull were And vile offence for one that honest is to write. But those that earst with hardy hande, and courage stout did fight, That vsed valiaunt armes and dealt with deadly blade, Not glutted with the greedie Golde, haue more of Poets made: And lou'd the loftie Muse and Uerse of stately stile. Those Martial Kings that foylde y? foe with haughtie hand erewhile, Extolde the haughtie Pen that did their battails blase: But straight assoone as warlike wights and Uertue fled the place, The Poets could not write, Inuention fainted thoe: The learned lost their brains, the floud of Uersing waxed lowe, To wracke went worthy workes. If now a dayes of fame Be any liuing that by warres hath gotte a gallant name: He forceth nought at all of after commers praise, Renoume of forraine land he scornes content with present dayes, (Quite glutted with good fame) and laude that they allowe, Whome he doth hourely see with eye and viewes with daylie browe. A sauage man outright he loues no learned skill, Or else of much desired golde can neuer haue his fill: But drowned lies in mucke and filthie Metals mire, Quite crusht with cares as Mydas was with greedie goldes desire. Besides with Princes are a rude and rusticke route, A spitefull sect: The flattring guest, the counterfaiting Loute Whose iestures maken glee, the baudie merchaunt eake, And he, that what so ere he sayes, to please the eare doth speake. Then he that playes on Stage, the iangling Iester to: Next him y? mate that hunts y? Whoore, and other thousandes moe That hate the Poet, and are Uertues deadlie foes: Expell him from the Princes Court. Much like as when the Crowes Haue lothsome Carraine founde and see the Carcas lie: They driue fr? thence both Foule and Beast, not letting them come nie. Againe some Poets are so out of reason rash, As (blockish beastes) they dare to make too fonde and foolish trash. And all to feede the eares and humours of the Peeres, Yea such as force no whit of fame. For Poets eke there steeres A kinde of frantick moode and madnesse of the braynes: These (but I wotte not what it is that therevnto constraynes) Will Poets be in hast and taken so abrode, As soone as once they haue in Pipe of hollow Hemlocke blowde. Well thinke they of them selues, vpon their bookes they bost Uile Fooles and sielly Sotts vntaught, not fitte to rule the rost: Foreseeyng nought at all foreright and witlesse men. Who so accustomde is to lende an eare vnto theyr Pen And foolish tedious tales, doe deeme there is no choice, But all are wise alike: and this is it that barres the voice Of learned men in deede, for that he knowes not howe To iudge the better from the worsse, Minerua from the Sowe. Siluanus. O Candid, I protest by Heauenly powers on hie, And haughtie Gods of Olympe hill that wield the scudding Skye: That I (if on my sayles there light a blessed blast) Will seeke to further thee in time, and be thy helpe at last. Meanewhile content thy selfe and champe on hope with me: Till better fortune shall allowe my friendlier fates to be. Candidus. If so thou meane me well, I wish thee like againe. Siluanus. Yes fayth wyth all my heart and minde, the proufe shall make it plaine, Within a little space. Candidus. Farewell thou churlish Chuffe, Pray God thou neuer mayst returne that neuer hast ynouffe. Would all thou handlest mought (as Mydas did of yore) Be Golde, for cause thou setst of Golde more than of Uertue store. The .vj. Egloge entituled CORNIX. The Argument. Howe Countrey differs from the Towne here Cornix he recites: He girdes the foolish-sotted Sectes, and gainst the witlesse writes. The speakers names. Cornix. Fulica. Cornix. The wrathfull Winter snowes, fell Borias blasts do blowe, The ysicles from houses hang: The man that earst did sowe And tillde his stonie soile, hath let a fielde his plowe, And takes his ease: the wearie ground it selfe doth slumber nowe. The Shephierd hauing shutte his dores, and caught his cloake Keepes house: Neæra eke doth sitte at home in smothering smoake At Chimnie nooke, and plies hir pottage Pot apace: Earst Sommer for his scalding heate, (when Sommer was in place) That was so much myslikte, is now commended sore: And Winter hated is of vs for whom we wisht before. Fulica. All present pleasure we but little worth esteeme, Surpassyng that which is to come (the hoped good) we deeme: Euen so the farther off the light the more the light doth seeme. Cornix. Eche Tune and ery Age his pleasure bryngs with it: See how the Countrey boyes vnkempt in patched garments knit, Reioyce at slaughter time when Piggs do go to Potte, They fill the Bladder full of Beanes, and hauing tide a knotte They rattell it a good: an other whiles withall Closefisted they theyr Elbows ioyne and foote the flying ball. And thus the Winter colde with trottyng here and there, And frosty time with coursing of the Countrey ball they weare. Yet wee farre better here in Chimnies like to burne I stretcht in Strawe, do wast the time whilst milke to crudde doth turne. Fulica. The Winter doth forshew the poore and needefull plight. We youthes are such a retchlesse route as do not wey a white The aftertime to come: In Sommer carelesse we Do lead our liues not minding what the Winter is wont to bee, And all our pence the Piper hath for making merry glee. When Borias makes retourne from Scythian frosty bounde And bared trees with battred boughes and leaues ylayde in grounde Bewray where byrds haue bredde and hatcht their chickens earst: Poore naked soules our shoulders, back, ribbs, feete with colde are pierst. Our folite Winter wries, more wise the Townish be, That heape their hoordes of wealth at home furrde downe beneath y? knee. The Foxe the bellie wraps, the stomacke gardes the Sheepe: With help of speckled Libart eke away the colde they keepe. Cornix. We Countrie men are Sottes and Fooles of erie age, But not alone we witlesse are: for why a madder rage In Citizens doth raigne. But Lady FORTVNE is A Damme to them, she seemes to vs a Mother lawe ywis. This Stepdamme sterne doth deale with vs in cruell sorte: They now a dayes are coumpted mad that beare the baser porte. But once allowe me wealth, let me haue riches store: Then I am best in all the towne, I shall goe all before. Then will my tale be hearde, I shall be masterd aye: Then crooke they knees, the caps go off, and marke what euer way I passe, the people crouch: my counsell then they seeke Both poore &amp; rich, the wealthy snudge, the saged Fathers eke. Fulica. O Cornix, 'tis not Chaunce that breedes this Witte in Man, But 'tis the minde: nor maken vs this Fortune wealthy can. 'Tis God that giues the goods as earst Amyntas sayde: 'Tis easy riches to attaine if he do stande our ayde. Cornix. Nay Fortune is a God, no doubt therof I haue. But what was it Amyntas tolde? of thee his tale I craue. For he was knowne a man of quicke and sharper braine Than diuers are, wherfore I would heare his good verdite fayne. But yet before thou hast that wise discourse begunne: Unto the Foldes to see our Flocks I pray thee (Fulike) runne. Trudge, and returne in haste, for after colde (thou knowst) A fitte of heate more welcome is, packe and retire in post. Fulica. Up to my knee doth reache the thicke vnthawed snowe, Scarse houses beare the weight therof: the Ouen that bakes the dowe, Hath at the very toppe great lumpes therof that lyes, And vp into a picked poynt it clymes in Pilier wyse. Cornix. Fill vp the Racke with hay that came of latter share: Do stoppe the clouen clifts with straw, if so the walles doe stare Or gape in any place: and ere thou hither come, Besmeare the thresholde round about with slime and bullocke lome. For nothyng more annoyes or banes a Beast than colde. What? art thou com? what means this hast? 'tis more than vse of olde. Fulica. Fie, Winter nippes me sore, this frost doth make me frette: The greatest comfort in the earth is, both in colde and heate, To hugge in reakyng hay, and when the colde is past In stiflyng straw to stretch our stumps and limmes on mow to cast. Cornix. Goe to, begyn to tell how Towne and Countrey trade Do swarue, the odds display thou here. Fulica. Thus good Amyntas made The diffrence twixt these two. Narratio What time the worlde began And things as yet were newly framde, then GOD did linke a Man With woman aye to liue, and marride them yfeare He willde the Man to get the Babes, the Woman babes to beare: And taught them how they should theyr children eke beget. At first they plyde theyr busynesse well, and did theyr taskerset. Woulde so they had done still, and let the fruite alone: And neuer tasted of that tree the Apple grewe vpon. The Woman wore a dame, both Boy and Wench she bore: And yearely so by like increase with men the earth did store. When fiftene yeares were past, GOD came again that way And there he found the Woman whilst she gan hir babes aray. Him she dyscride a farre, as she at thresholde sate. (This while was Adam gone a fielde this Womans wedded Mate. He carelesse fed his flocke, as then was no mystrust Of falshode twixt the man and wife. But when that growing lust Made manie marri'ge knots: then false they gan to play, They knockt the Goate about the pate and reft his hornes away To graffe on Husbandes heade: then iealous seede begonne To take his roote in Husbandes breast, he doubted of his Sonne. For men that false a boorde themselues are wont to play, Mystrust their wiues will goe about their auncient debtes to pay.) Herewith the Mother blusht, and bare hir selfe in hande So manie babes would ouermuch against his liking stand, And make hir be suspect of too much wanton lust: She ranne and hid me some in hay, and some in chaffe she thrust. In came the mightie GOD, and hauing blest the place Sayd: Woman fetch me all thy babes that I may see their face. The Mother brought the biggst and let the lesser lie: GOD likt them well. As men are wont (as daylie proufe doth trie) Of Foules and senting Houndes to like the eldest best. First to the senior of his Sonnes thus spake the GOD and blest. Take thou this kinglie Mace, supplie a Kesars roome: Unto the second brother Armes, and made him Mars his groome. Be thou a Duke (quod he) and daunt thy foes in fight: And then at last he shewde out Roddes and Axe to open sight, With Twigs of tender Uine and noble Romaine dart: And Offices gan deale about to euery Babe a part. Wherwith the Mother glad to see hir Sonnes extolde, Ranne in, and fetcht out all hir broode, and sayd: Thou God beholde These are my belly fruite, these in my wombe I bare As well as those: vouchsafe to let these haue some part of share. Their bristled pates were white with chaffe, the strawe it hoong About their armes, and spider webbs that to the wattles cloong. Those likte him nought at all not one he fanside well, But frowning sayd: Auaunt you Gifes, of mowe and mould you smell. Take you the goryng Goade and countrey punchyng pricke: Take you the spitting Spade in hande, and Garden setting sticke. To you the Culter longs, the Yoake and other trash: You shall be Ploughmen, Carters you, with Whip to giue the lash. You shall be Shephierdes you, haycutters, delue the soile: You shall be Seamen, Cowardes eke, turmoilde with endlesse toile. But yet among you all we do appoint that some Shall leaue the clownish Countrey life and to the Towne shall come. As Puddingmakers, Cookes, the Butchers, Piewiues eake: And other such like sluttish Artes of whome I doe not speake: That wonted are to sweate and at the Coales to burne, Like Drudges wasting all their dayes to serue their maisters turne: This done, the mightie GOD departed from the Skies. Thus twixt the Towne &amp; Country did the difference first arise. Thus were the Clowns ymade, as good Amyntas doth deuise. Cornix. If he had ought sayde well I would haue marueld much: He was a Townish man, and they do euer beare a grutch And byte with bitter scoffe vs poore and Countrey soules, 'Tis all the worke they haue to do, aye vs the Towne controls. Yea, they will nothing shame against the Gods to iest, Deuising trifles like to this. Art thou so plaine a gest And stuft with Pudding so and hast thy belly full, As that thy selfe art toutcht herein can neuer pierce thy skull? This nippe is euen a taunt: but let vs for a space Unto the follies of the Towne conuert our Countrey face, And iudge of all their deedes: least thou surmize perhaps That they are wyser vnto whome the people vaile their caps: And such as daylie goe in Golde and Purple weede, Than we that homelie Rustickes are and simple men in deede. I sundrie times haue seene men cladde in costly geare Like Princes bout the Market square and ietting here and theare: Quite hunger steru'd at home and Kitchins voide of Cookes, As poore as Iob, when all was weyde for all their loftie lookes. What follie more than this? to beare of wealth a face, And be a needie Begger yet for all the painted case? Men but beguile themselues in vsing this deuise. Yea more than that, my selfe haue seene the Office fathers wise That beare the onely sway (O vile and filthie crime) Whilst they themselues wil liue at ease and leudly waste the time: Set out their wiues to hire and daughters to be solde: What can be worsse? or fowler fact? what more to be controlde? Fulica. Put case they can not finde another way to liue? Cornix. No? did not GOD as many handes and other Senses giue To them, as vnto vs? yes. Then I pray thee tell The very reason (Fulick) why they can not liue as well? Nay, more than that are some that practize daylie feate To come by wealth by vaine deuise as neuer man could get. With iuice of sappie hearbes they rubbe and burnish Brasse, In hope to make it Golde in time, and bring their willes to passe In wresting Nature cleane and chaunging kinde by skill: They puffe the coales in pensiue care with swarth and smoakie gyll. Another studies harde and plies inchauntments sore, In hope to finde some hidden vaine of Golde, vnknowne before That lurkes in dampe of ground and hollowe Uault belowe, And playes the Witch, but nothing gaines as proufe doth plainly showe. What vainer toye than this? what leude or lighter iest? Bycause they would auoide the plough- mans life that is the best, They practize euery feate, attempting euery thing: They ofte begin, but neuer ought to good effect can bring. They euer turne and wende and kepe a daylie coile, To kepe them from the carefull Carte and tilling of the soile. By Money loane and Use of filthie Fulckers trade, (That Usurie may well be termde) infamous shiftes be made. They practize force and fraude, and double dealing aye: They lay their wilie hookes for wealth, deuising day by day A meane to mount to state and Honours tickle throne. Whilst we Sheepe, Goates &amp; flockes do feede and let such trickes alone: They keepe their sowring Haukes, they foster barcking Houndes, They haue their footecloth Nags to ride about their Pasture groundes. Of Munkies much they make and other Apish toyes: This is the onely trade they vse, these are the Townish ioyes. The Rusticke Cattle keepes, the Townsman Currs and Kites: I pray thee iudge which is the best of theirs or our delightes? Which most with Worship standes? which brings the greater gaine? Fulica. If so our trade be bett' than theirs, then how should they attaine Such store of stamped Coine, and Riches as they haue? How come they by that daintie fare? bow by those garmentes braue? Cornix. How man? By slipper craft, by pelting pilfring shiftes: By subtile fetches of the minde, by double diuelish driftes. What (madman) dost not see how vs they daylie wring In cruell wise? If of our wordes (a vile and beastlie thing) They take aduauntage once and catch vs in a trippe: We shall be sure to feele the smart and byde the lashing whippe. They deeme a godlie deede to take vs in the snare: And this is all their whole deuise, their studie and their care. Fulica. Whie? Howe befalls that thou the Citie knowst so well? Cornix. Howe? This I learned earst while I my milke was wont to sell, And had my female Goates within the Citie wall, I oasted at a Bakers house, he knewe their manners all. He was a craftie Childe, and with his yron would Goe cut the doawe, and nip the loaues when Maidens gan to mould. He, as he wist their wile and knewe their craftie trade, Sayd, that the Citie was a Hell. A whole discourse he made Of their vnthriftie liues that in the towne did wonne: And tolde me, that to filtch at first himselfe had there begonne. In Cities other are with beastly baudie rule That wast the wealth their Grandsires gaue and plying of the Cule. They haue their minion Trulls and wanton fleshly Froes: Oh, what more filthie can be founde than is the life of those? (Pray) where is Whordome vsde? Manslaughter and Uprore? Beare these in Cities not the sway, and euer did of yore? Where lodge those Kings that seeke their Crownes by losse of bloode? And force their subiects to the death that in their quarrell stoode? Where wonne the warly wights that with such desperat hartes Obiect themselues to fearfull foe and dint of deadlie dartes? For slender wages they do hazard life and all: What madnesse more th? theirs that so do seeke for sodaine fall? Of life they lesse accompt than of a blast of fame. And what is glorie, praise, or laude? what Worship? Honours name? What giddie peoples voice and brute of foolish braines? All dies and weares away with time, death all this trumperie staines, All sodainly do flitte as light when Sunne doth dimme. And they that hauing wealth at Land vpon the Surge will swimme, And leaue their Countrey coast are folish wights I trowe: He wants his witts that will aftie in windes and water so. Who so hath store of wealth and vseth not the same, Is mad I thinke: But yet of all that man is most to blame That liues a Misers life and ouerharde doth fare, And heapes his treasure in a hoorde and all for Sonne to spare: And leaues the thing vndone (which he mought compasse well) For children that shall after come when he is deade in Hell. All such as number starres and meddle with the Skies, And those that calke the dayes of birth, and thinke they can comprise By skill to scan the fate to man that shall betide, Are verie fooles: But from his wits yet he is farder wide The nature of the Gods that doth ensearch to knowe, And dares vpon so great a light his little eyes to throwe. Farre better is our faith: for Townsmen euer looke To haue a Reason, else they will scarce credit any booke. Bare wordes we soone beleeue that are of Countrey stampe, And at the sacred Altar set vp many a light and Lampe. The Cytizens are harde of faith, and neuer blinne To search the secrets of the Gods: whome if it were no sinne To descant of so much, but that we ought to knowe Their natures, then th?selues they mought vnto our Senses showe. But sithens they would haue their secret kinde vnknowne: What meane we to enquire of Gods and let them not alone? Our charitie bysides the Townish zeale exceedes. For holie men that serue the Church and weare the sacred weedes, What store of meate get they which goe from place to place, Of vs that in the Countrey dwell within a little space? I Bargeis lode haue seene of Graine and goodly Corne Brought from the countrie to y? towne, we aye such zeale haue borne. Another sect of Sottes and foolish men there are: As pettie Foggers, barking Buggs and Pleaders at the barre, Well skilde to scrape for coine euen Tirants in their trade: For fee they sell their helping hand, for money they are made The wrongfull case to pleade: they make theyr chiefest gaine By letting Causes longer hang than neede or lawe constraine Within the cruell Court where matters are to heare, And what at one Court day mought end, they linger on a yeare. Physitions eke there are from place to place that ride On Mullets, that full often strike the vaines that are denide, And minister amisse, and for dyseases frame (Whose kind they neuer knew before a certaine terme and name. And they (though Arte they want and lack good Physicks skill) Haue lawfull leaue to vexe the sicke, yea Patientes eke to kill. And those that Office beare and swinge the chiefest sway, The more authoritie they haue the more they runne astray. The madder waxen they once placde in Rulers roome. O, what of holie Gouernours and Fathers is becoome, Of whome our Elders earst by fier sitting tolde? Nowe all is gone to spitefull wracke that hath bene seene of olde. The Temples are defaste, the poore do make complaint, The widows weepe &amp; wring their h?ds with too much griefe attaint. And what should be the cause that things are at this hande? The onely reason is for that that Lust for Lawe doth stande. Fulica. Fie (Cornix) fie, your rage beyonde all reason goes: Thou all men dost condemne alike. What (man) thou must suppose That of the Townish some are good, in Citie dwell Some honest men that leade their liues and get their riches well. Comix. I haue forgot the name, but sure thereof I stande, Nie Balearia liues no Snake, all venome voides the lande. No Owle in Creta cries, no Horsse or Gelding runnes On mount Ægeria: nor no ho- nest man in Citie wunnes. Fulica. An honest man is scarce, in Countrey and in Towne: And vertue is as rare a thing as any may be foune. Cornix. O Fulick thou art mad, that takst their partie so: Eche one that in the Citie dwels is thy vndoubted foe. They shaue vs close to skinne, they pill and make vs bare: They force vs first to filtch, and then our neckes they do not spare. They wey not they a whit though we to Gallowes goe, They tye vs vp in hampring corde on tree to feede the Crowe. If we haue ought that likes their fansie or their lust, They thinke to wring it fr? our hands, it is both good and iust. They plucke away our plumes and feathers one by one: They neuer linne to scrape our goodes till all our wealth be gone. Which if we chaunce to see, excuses then are had: But so we see not when 'tis done, they will denie like mad They neuer toke away one iote but was their owne: No wrong they do esteeme the Theft to be that is vnknowne. Thus all the wealth they haue and mucke that lies in mowe By our sustained toile they gat and sweate of painfull browe. Fulica. Nay, now you farre exceede the bounds of meane and right. Cornix. O Fulicke, Townish shameful prancks infect the worlde quite. What makes in Sommer time so many rotten shoures? Such thundring flakes, winde, flouds &amp; haile, as from the Heauen poures? I yet remember I haue seene the ground to quake: The haughtie roofes of houses fall, and Pillerpostes to shake: The Sunne obscurde with darke amid the shining day: And in the night the Moone ydimde and Starrelight tane away. Howe chaunst that stinking weedes the graine do ouergrowe, And wilde and barraine Oates oppresse the hoped Haruest so? How hapt the Goate inuades and tramples downe the Uine? That smelling flours in spring are spilt, and Garden goods do pine? All these missehappes by meane of ciuill Townish yll Befall: and moe in time (I feare) thereby such myschieues will. Whence come these rash vproares? whence springs this battails broile, That brings with it all kind of plagues that so annoy the soile? The Citie is the head and Fountaine whence it flowes. Lycaon hee that cruell Woulfe (whome all the wordle knowes) From Citie did discende: Deucalion (with his make Good Pyrrha) was a Countrieman. 'Twas for Lycaons sake That all the earth was drownde, Deucalion peasde the waue: Lycaon murthred many men, Deucalion man did saue: He toke them from the earth, this brought them life againe. If euer Fire should wast the worlde (as some affirme it plaine) That mischief shall descend from Towne and Citie sure: Their vile and filthy liuing will those cruell plagues procure. Fulica. O Cornix, leaue to talke, I heare the boyes to call For pottage, (lest I be deceiude) if ought be left, it shall At after dinner bee debated and discust: Now let vs plie the paunch, the houre declares to meate we must. The .vij. Egloge entituled POLLVX. The Argument. Here Galbula extols the Shephierds to the Skie: And tels how Pollux did conuert that sawe the Sainct with eie. The speakers names. Alphus. Galbula. What thinkst thou Galbula? sir Pollux passing fine In piping earst (I wotte not howe) inspirde with powre deuine Forwent his Pipe, his Weede, his charge of Beasts, his Mates, And hooded (as the Lapwings are with crists vpon their pates) Foure dayes agoe himselfe to holie house did yelde. Some think that whilst his flock he fed alone in open fielde, He sawe some godlie shape from Heauen to appeare, (The rest I haue forgot) but what thinkst thou? I long to heare. Galbula. As Sages sayde, when God eche creature gan to make, (No trifles I will tell, but such of yore as Vmber spake) Both Clownish countrey wights and Shephierdes he ordainde: The Tylman tough, vnmilde, in ci- uill nurture neuer trainde, Much like the lumpish clay that Culter doth controll: The Shephierd of a softer kinde a sielly hurtlesse soule. As simple as the Sheepe, deuoide of wrathfull gall, The Sheepe that yelds the milk, &amp; likes his keeper aye withall. From flocke to Altare he would bring when so he came Sometime a Sheepe, a fatted Calfe, sometime a sucking Lambe. To Gods their honour due he gaue with good intent: His seruice so preuailde with them, he so their Godheads bent, As since the time the worlde created was and made, Unto this houre most gratefull was to Gods the Shephierds trade. And more than this, he callde Assyrians a sort, (Their names through care I haue forgot) to Mace and Kingly port, That Shephierds were afore: who garnisht braue in Golde And purple roabes, proude countries oft in battaile haue controlde. That Paris that behelde three Goddesses in Ide, With Paris eke the Syre that would haue forc'd his sonne to haue dide, A Shephierd was. When Moy- ses fearde with heauenly fyre Came barefoote through the fieldes to see the signe with great desyre, A shephierd then he was and lately come from floud. Apollo (as a bannisht man) in Grece did thinke it good His Godhead layde aside a Shephierds charge to take, And so th' Amphrisian fields to walke and Bowe and shafts forsake. Those sacred Angels eke when Christ in Oxen stall Was born, forspake for shephierds sake that he would be a thrall. And Shephierds being taught the miracles diuine Of heauenly birth, did first beholde the thundring Impe with eyen. The mightie Infant gaue the Shephierds libertie Before the wise and royall Kings in Cradle him to see. A Shephierd he him selfe disdained not to call, Those men he termed Sheepe that sim- ple were and meeke withall. And least you thinke I lie, from Citie home againe To Countrie as I came, In Church I redde them painted plaine. There portrayde are the Beasts and little Lambes that lie On soile beside their dames. A hu- gie troupe from mountains hie Of Gods on horsseback c?mes, their Diademes do blaze With glittring Golde, this sight doth make the passers by to gaze. No maruell then if Gods appearde to Pollux sight: In Uillages, in Sheepe and home- lie Sheepecots they delight: GOD is a guest to simple men, the haughtie he doth spite. Alphus. Thou telst the truth, I wish the fieldes as hurtlesse bee Unto your Beasts. The Asse, the rack, and Bullocke I did see. I call to minde the route that thither flockt apace, Me thinkes I see the Kings of Inde that brought their gifts in place. One thing I craue, what kinde of shape did Pollux see? And if thou knowst it (Galbula) do daine to tell it mee. Galbula. I knowe it well, and will rehearse the storie true, A worthie fact to tell or heare for all men to ensue. The froward Father, and the Stepdame full of pride, Had pressed Pollux necke with yoake vneasie to abide, In tender yeares when youth sweete pleasures doth persuade: But when he fealt his force to faile through such a weary trade, And sawe no Arte preuailde their rigor to relent, He thought it best to runne away: and thus to flight ybent His onely let was this, he lou'd impatiently. For doting loue (a common fault) doth Youth accompany. Loue of it selfe is strong, the violence doth passe. He went: At parture (these complaints to me he wonted was His dolours to declare) with mourneful voice he spake: Wilt thou (O Uirgin) shead thy teares for such a traytors sake? And when thou seest thy selfe by Louer so betrayde, Wilt thou bewaile the want of him that such a pranke hath playde? Wilt thou thy cruell Friend remember in distresse? Or shall that louyng breast of thine a chillie colde possesse? That breast that hath prouokte so many weeping eyes, Wilt thou wax wan for grief? wilt thou sende sighings to the Skies? I see the Uirgins eyes hir eares, hir panting hart. Alas may any cunning now conceale my secrete smart? A double dolour doth distraine my troubled minde, Hir griefe and my distresse: my woe to waile is me assignde, But not to hir: my fire more couertly doth burne. You Gods (I trust) will hir preserue in health till my returne. That after my exile when I shall backe retire, Our loue may haue a good successe ere youthfull yeares expire. Thus talking he did passe, and would haue turnde againe: Such loue had bleard the boy, such frensie broylde in youthfull braine. But now the Dice were cast, decreed was the flight, He vnderneath a Popple tree sate downe a wofull wight. Beholde a Uirgin crownde with Garlande he did see, Hir face, hir eyes, and habite were Nymphlike in eche degree. She did approche, and thus the sorie boy bespake. (Sweet Lad) where wilte thou wander now? thy purposde pathes forsake. Alas thou wottst not where this way woulde bring thee streight, Yet darst thou goe to places straunge: and thinking no deceipt To lurke in grassie fielde, eche perill thou neglectst, All safe thou deemst, &amp; that which likes thee best, thou most respectst Like vnaduised youth. The Adder knit in knot, And lurking in the grasse doth bite the man that sawe him not. Th' vnware is soone begilde. The Infant dares assay Withouten dreade in burning Coales with tender handes to play, And thinkes it but a sport vntill he feele the fire. This Countrie traines the Passengers at first with sweete desire, And proffers pleasures rife with ioyes exceeding all: But entred once, foreseeing not the hurte that may befall, It setts a thousand snares and planteth perills more. This path as soone as you haue past, that hill you see before Leades to a shadie wood where cruell beasts do dwell, To dungeons deepe and lothsom vauts, as blacke as any Hell. And who so is intrapt shal thence retire no more: For first he hath a fillet swarth and vaile his eyes before. Then drawne about the wood through sharpe and shrubby thornes, To Monster he transformed is: and whilst his tongue he turnes And thinks to speake, he howles, and coueting vpright To go, he groueling creepes on foure, the heauens are barrd his sight. Beneath a Ualley darke, a Pit with waters blake Doth stand, and then a mountayn huge doth ouerlooke the Lake. Thus drawne to stinkyng Styx, is headlong downe ycast Into the filthy foorde, the Sinke doth swallowe him in hast: Thus damnde to Styx in shade for aye he must abyde. Alas, how many Shephierds through these dotyng fitts haue dyde? And perisht with theyr flocks? but I am busie still As one vntirde, to shewe the way and wrest thee from the yll. Wherfore do way delayes and flie the flattring dore That traines to death, go seeke the coast that leades to secrete shore, Against th' Idalian floods where Carmelus is seene, To lift his head aloft to Skies bedeckt with Garlande greene. To auncient fathers first this Hill gaue dwellings good, As caues and houses made of trees within a brushy wood. From thence Religion first deriu'd his ofspring tooke, And came amongst your hills, as from his head, the running brooke, And from one Grandsire as do many Nephews sproute. In those same woods, where Beechyboughes are growing all about, Where fattie Pix doth sweate and Terebynth doth shed His glewlike gum, and clammie iuyce. There after thou hast led A happie hurtlesse life deuoide of vile offence: Then into places euer greene and flourishing from thence I will aduaunce thee streight, a better lodge to dwell: Immortall shalt thou waxen then, and (marke what tale I tell) Thou shalt as fellowe made vnto the heauenly States, Get vp aboue the starres, and haue the Nimphs vnto thy mates, Both Hamadriads and the hillie Orcads hight, And Napes, Ladies that in sweetes and Garlands doe delight: With lawfull leaue to haue y? Skies both vp and downe in sight. Thus hauing tolde hir tale to Skie the Uirgin flewe. Th? Pollux sware his mind was turnd, and heart ychangde a new Forwent his furies fitte. Euen as the firie flash Is quencht, wh? Padus with his streame the frying fields doth wash: So parted cruell Loue, that earst his Arrowes shot At him (good youth) that striuing would those colde hote fitts forgot: And so good Pollux he to silent Cloyster came. Alphus. Yea mary, Gods some men inspire, that looke not for the same, But they with other wroth and causelesse angry bee. Galbula. Such powre haue Gods on vs as on our sielly sheepe haue wee. This knowledge will suffice vs simple Countrie clownes: Let them contende for greater witte that weare the Scarlet gownes And in the Citie woonne. Thus person Ianus tolde Returnde from towne, and sayd he sawe it writte in storie olde. Alphus. Nowe goes the Sunne to glade he toucheth top of hills, Wherfore that wee with him depart his wonted parting wills. O Galbula get vp those trinkets on thy backe The Scrippe is light, the bottle light, no payne to beare the packe. For though the burthen way yet is it good to beare, Do that, and I will fetch our flockes, for nowe the day doth weare. The .viij. Egloge entituled RELIGIO. The Argument. Two Shephierds met yfeare, one likt the Mountaines most, And tother did commend the Vale aboue the Hillie coast. The praise of Pollux Sainct is intermingled here, And sacred feasts, with holie dayes that happen in the yere. The speakers names. Candidus. Alphus. O Alphus, now the scortched ground doth thirst, bycause the Sunne Is in the hiest point of Heauen that he is wont to runne. Wherfore vnto the hanging hills this present time persuades To driue our flocks where Deaw is rife and Mountes do cast their shades. Alphus. Yea, yea, I see the hills afarre and haughtie Mountains hie: But (to be plaine) what of the hills to make I know not I. For from my Cradle custome was with mee to feede my sheepe In Uale belowe, by riuers side to dwell, and flocke to keepe. Upon the hillie grounde (I pray) what kinde of corn doth sproute? Candidus. O simple siellie witted lobbe, O plaine and pieuish loute, That aye hast dwelt by damping flouds and filthie Fennes belowe, Much like the Gnats that haunt y? lakes where brushe and rubbish growe, And where the sluttish vermin cause a sauour like to hell, And stifling stinke in durtie dikes, and Marrish deapth to dwell. Wher is of frogs, gnats, flies &amp; wormes and other like good store, Among the Willowes, Alderboughes and rotten Reedes, with more Than I can name: and yet dost thou thus dare to mocke the Hills And make so small accompt of them? From whence (I pray thee) trills The spouting Spring? and where (good friend) is marble quarre yfounde That builds y? Church? where grows y? gold? in vale or hillie ground. What soile brings forth the lofty mast? where growes the Phisicke grasse? And herbes to cure diseases fell, if not in hillie place? I sundry times on Baldus mount the Bearefoote gathred haue, Which Goates diseasde from force of death is ready way to saue: As Ægon earst to me declarde when he did geld at Spring His sowes &amp; lambes, he taught me that as sure and soueraine thing. Take here (quod he) the passingst heart that euer grew on grounde. And further tell me (pray thee) where are Chesnuts to be founde More plentuous than on Hills aloft? where greater store of Mast? There ar both groues &amp; pasture gro?ds: there I haue broke my fast With Pie full many a time and oft, and fattie gruell eate, There are the sturdie Children borne bolde youthes in my conceate, Brode footed Lads w? shoulders square, well brawned armes and strong, All hairy, handed harde, whose backes no weight can lightly wrong. From thence come lustie Mariners, that sayle the marble Seas, Are none more fitte for Towne affaires or Citie than are these. Where thou wilt haue thy Cattell cut, or seeling timber fellde, Or Stables varmde, the Priuie cleansd or staying stoppe that helde The filth, remoud from where it lay and bred a lothsome smell, Or men by Ladders to descende to Uaultes as darke as Hell: These, these, are they that do the feate, their witts are passing good, And they are of exceeding force and lustie strength by th Roode. But what shall neede so many woords? all toyle they take in hande: Waite in the kitchin, make the Fire, cast on the Chimney brande, Turne broth in c?ning wise, make clean and purge the loouer hole, For smoke to passe, beare gutts &amp; tripes to riuer in a Bole, Swepe filthie floore with Birch? broome, but most I meruaile how They run with burthen on their backes and neuer seeme to bowe. They are bred vp among the Rockes and mid the Mountaines woonne, Like Goates into the crooked Caues of sauage Beasts they roonne. Beside this, eake the way is short from top of Hills to Skie, Up to the azure cloudes they reach: and some do stande so hie As verily I deeme they touche the golden starres welnie They say there is a place where as the Sunne from Sea doth rise, Which (if I well remember) seemes vnto our mortall eyes Euen with his head to touche y? Moone, and that there liud a man: But afterward when greedy Lust and licorous lips began To tast the fruite that was forbid, and that he eate vp all The Apples, keeping none for God when he for fruite did call, This Glutton was expelde the place not suffred there to dwell. This makes that holie fathers like the lofty Hills so well, And there do choose them quiet stayes to leade their lyues in rest: As Carthuse witnesse can full well, Carmelus, Gargans crest, Laureta, Athos, Lauern, Syne, Soractis picked pate, And Nursis thou that famous art for aged Fathers fate. And good Gamalula, whose head so turretlike doth stande, Beset with Beeche and other trees that grow about the lande. As for the rest I ouerpasse, for why I do not mynde In this my tale to compasse all. The Gods of stately kynde Do oft frequent the hilly holtes, when downe in vale below Dwel Ducks, Didopper, Bitour, Goose Kite, Shag, and other moe. Alphus. Among the Pleasures of the hills wherof you speake so much, How chauncde that you do nothing here the Uine and Haruest touch? And yet those two are chiefest stayes and aydes in life of Man. Candidus. Those Mountain lads from rocky hills come hither nowe and than To buye our Corne in market place, Grym wights all grymde with dust, As rough as hogs, as leane as rakes raggd, leaping at a crust. The dwellers shewe the places kinde and what his nature is. But that you spake of Sacred vse and Mountaine holynis Hath brought vnto my mynde agayne of Pollux what is sayd. Alphus. O Candid, if thou canst declare What Goddesse 'tis, what Mayde, Say on, for that wherof we gan to chatte, is all in vaine: More better were of holie trade to talke, and greater gaine. Candidus. That Galbula that earst was wont with thee his flocke to feede, Could fully haue instructed thee in thy demaunde with speede. Alphus. Of Pollux much was sayd before, but yet no worde was spoke There of the Nymph, nor did I then him thervnto prouoke. But now this talke of Church affaires and holie sacred things (For sure they best deserue the praise) to my remembrance brings. Candidus. She was no Driad Nimph perdie that in the woods doth woonne: She was no Muse of those that boute Lybethris Mount doth roonne. Nor any of those Orcades that haunt the hills on hie: But Mother shee to Mightie GOD descended from the Skie. To bring a peace to such as in distresse and trouble lie. Dame Tethys is hir wayting mayde, and lady Ceres eke Attendes hir traine, and Æole he that by his force doth breake And bridles wrath of waiward windes that in his prison are. Hir, God hath plast aboue the Sunne and golden glistring starre Aboue Cassiope the fayre, and hath adornde hir head And sacred front with twice six Signes that hir enuiron spread: And more than that, the watrie Moone that shewes hir face by night Full vnderneth hir godly foote his prouidence hath pight. Alphus. O Candid, wonders thou declarste which Shephierds neuer knew, What is that Tethys tell me, and Cassiops glittring hewe? What is that Æole that in denne doth bridle blustring winde? What be those fierie Stoads? thou tellst great meruailes, rare to finde. Candidus. Some part of them bee starres in deede, some part names founde of olde. All which when Pollux had to me in largest maner tolde, Into the Temple ledde me forth and sayde: This Sacred Wall That here thou viewst, is able well to make thee shewe of all. The wall was painted ful of Signes and Figures all about, All I remember not, my braine is weake, 'tis quickly out: Scarce this I bore away, for all I ofte reuolu'd the same, And did recompt within my head eche thing, and ery name. For sundry times for to recompt a thing in couert brest All Phisicke farre excells, I deeme that feate to be the best. That Uirgin can from darkned Skies, the duskie cloudes remoue, She can to partched corne giue drinke to make the Haruest proue. And when hir pleasure is, she can cause springs in fields to rise, And when hir list represse the same againe in wondrous wise. She can (if be hir pleasure) make the baraine soile and grounde As fatte as any pasture, and make it with grayne abounde. When Scorpius in his darksome lodge and hellish house receiues The olde Saturnus frosty starres, that worldly things bereaues Of blissefull state, this Uirgin can inforce to kepe no coyle: The rattlyng hayle shall nothing noye the Corne vpon the soyle. The house shall neuer fall by fyre or wasted be with flame: For now they say, the Skies procure and angrie starres the same. Oh, if this Uirgin be disposde, she can make all things sure, If she be frendly, corne shall fill the barnes, she can procure Eche beast to bring a twinne to light to glad the maisters minde, Yea and she list, although the sheepe be drie and notte by kinde, She can enforce with twink of eye and becke of friendly browe The dugge to strout with milke, y? back with wooll, and Lambes ynowe. She can remoue all vile disease that noyes the hurtlesse Beast, She can tell how to cure the flocke with any griefe opprest. Now needlesse is to follow Pan or any rusticke Saint: Which auncient folks did honour so, with follies mist attaint. I sawe about the Altare of this Uirgin, sucking Kid, Ploughs, Oxen, Sheepe, &amp; Ianus Goat, and written there I spid In table that at Altar hoong this Uerse: Here Ianus hee That lost his Goate, for Goate yfo?d doth offer this to thee. And whilste I red this writte on wall with knee on marble stone Gan Pollux pray before the Are and Uirgin call vpon. He sayd: O Goddesse that preserust both Towne and Countrey well I pray that Padus boue his banks and limites may not swell. And that no Fayrie sucke by night our babes in our armes, Nor that such Heggs about our coast may rangle with their charmes. O Goddesse fauour husbandmen, the wastfull Want destroy That is our daylie foe, and doth our pasture grounds anoye. O Goddesse, when the Winter coms and we haue sowne our seede, Sende downe some pleasant showres of raine to moist the soile at neede Lest creping wormes, and vermine vile in yeare that is to come Do gnaw y? corne with marring mouth and lothsome little gumme. From Borias blast defende the Fig, from cruell Crane the Beanes, The Haruest corne from greedie Geese ybred in Marrish Fennes. The Oxe from spitting Adders iawes, from Foxe and Theefe the Sheepe, From Locust Coales &amp; Lettis leaues, the Uine in Winter keepe. The flock &amp; folde from Woulfes deceit, the corne from burning blast, The dogs from madnesse, towns fr? fire and thundring bolts ycast. The legge of Bacon from the Mouse, the G?mon from the wight That kepes the Campe, and in the fielde doth dayly vse to fight. From Palmer, and the slouthfull: Oh, I haue welnie forgot The rest, perhaps recitall of the former Uerse will not Be hurtfull, but reduce to minde what I had thought to say: Wherfore I will begin agayne, where I right now did stay. The legge of Bacon from the Mouse the G?mon from the wight That keepes the Campe, and in the field doth dayly vse to fyght. From Palmer and the slouthful Snaile the Gardens greene as Grasse. Seest (Alphus) what a Uerse can do? now is it come to passe As earst I thought it would in deede, remembrance is renewde. O Uirgin saue from thunders rore A sillie shephierdes simple request. the Drinke we lately brewde. Kepe wel the blossomd Ewes from cold, the Calues from stinging Flie. The Hogs fr? squince &amp; swelling throte so that they may not die. That Ploughmens labour be not lost O Goddesse do thy best, Let not the Hyues of Hony Bees by Hornets be opprest. Ne let the Lynet spill the Hirce or Myllet seedes destroy, Nor briers, by renting of the wooll ere sheare tyme, sheepe anoy. Let not the hangyng burre sticke fast vpon the hairie fleese That makes the flocke pildnecked, and his couering coate to leese. O Goddesse that dost gouerne men and hast of children care, O Goddesse ease to laboryng wights and suche as byde the care. The salue to such as are diseasde, of flockes the chiefest stay, I thee beseche to yelde a becke to this that I do say. This prayer deuoutly Pollux made the whilst I leande my backe Unto a poast, and stayde my foote against a staffe, it stacke Within my braine that he had sayd, his wordes I noted well, I plaste the processe in my brest that he before did tell. Alphus. How thinkst thou Candid is't not right and reason that we should To Pollux yelde some gift for prayers and Sacred tale he tolde? For sure by suche deuotion our richesse are preseru'd. Candidus. What els? somewhat we must bestow, for somewhat he deseru'd. Alphus. What shal we giue? by th' Roode a Calf is costly to forgoe, We either will a Lambe, or Hare, or Goose on him bestowe. Candidus. The time instructeth what to giue. at Winter serues the Hare, When for the Snowe he can no the Goose we best may spare At latter end of Haruest time when Sommer weares away The Filberd, Appels, clustred Grapes about Midsommer day. The sucking Kids, and bleating Lambs at entring of the Spring. For then if rotten haye by chaunce anoide them any thing, Or any thou so weake espie, as nether well can liue, Nor butcher in the market place for him will money giue, (The gifte will be accepted well) that Lambe of all the rest Bestow (I say) to make a friende with him I compt it best. Let Pollux haue it for his paines and solemne tale ytolde. He after dinner when that I from him departed would, Gaue me such Uerses as he founde writte in some auncient booke Of holy Uirgins solemne feastes: and said, I pray thee looke Upon this geare when so by happe thou art with care opprest, Recount this medcine of the minde and fixe it fast in brest. What time the Sunne the Lion leaues and Virgo entres in, Then in remembrance of this Uir- gin let the youth begin And aged eke with siluer haires, to triumph and be glad, For then she left the earth and to the Skies hir iourney had. The foure and twenteth after that is holy day anewe, This Uirgins birth day makes y? church and altars (this is true) With taper light to shine like fire and glister all with flame: Then doth y? Priest new offrings make, the time requires the same. Then Libra makes returne in hast to cause the Sommer night To be full equall with the day and so appeare in sight. The men of Pycen waxen glad on Adrianus flood Then come Illyrians, Chaons eke and Thuscans with their good And ware to sell for greedy gayne, from Vmbria other some, Venetians, men of Sicill to Lauretum temple come By troupes to offer vp their gifts: and hauing prayde a time, Up to the statelie mountaine they in flockes togither clime. And when the Sunne doth enter in his house that bends the Bowe By shorter course, and bitter frosts anoy the soile belowe, Shut vp in Cloister close she did the mightie God conceaue, Which contemplation from hir head did worldly thoughts bereaue. Hir proper parents she forgot, so much on God she thought. And when that Phœbus flees the Bowe whose string is bent so tought, And gins vnto the lodging colde of horned Goate to goe: Then let both man and woman on with garments best to showe, And let them keepe that sacred day high holy feast, wherin With sacred seede that aged Sire did fill his wife within. For in that day aboue the rest she did conceiue the childe That washt away the sinne that woulde all mortall men defilde. When Sol the moistie harbour of Aquarius vnderglides, At point to bring the Spring about: then go you gallant brides And Matrons, set the Altars ful of torch and taper light, Cast cense in flame to make a fume bring candles blasing bright, Make pompe as great as ere you can. This Lady brought a bed Hir little Babe hath borne to church and hath full happly sped. When he the Captaine of the hierd with glittring fleece of golde (I meane the Ramme) begins to quite the earth from Winter colde, And brings the gentle fitts of heate and pleasant puffes of winde Allowing day more houres than night, as is the Sommers kinde, Let Gabriell then the Angell come and do his message right, Declaring tidings to the Nimph that made the Nimph afright. That Holie day the Thuscans all from Mountains makes descends And Arnycols procureth to the Florence Church to wende. And then (for why the Uirgin was not long before they say, Espousde) becomes vnwedded maides to celebrate the day. When Phebus vnder farthest point of crawling Crabbe doth goe, And Dogge approching brings disease, and makes the feuers growe: kepe holie eke that sacred tide, with incense cast in fyre, For Mary then from mother of Iohn did home agayne retire. About the stonie Altars hang to either damme a share (In token of your ioyfull hearts) of Lady Ceres ware. The Corne that first was ripe in fields, and gan to change his hewe, Do offer that (I say) to them that Mothers are to view. This Pollux taught: for walking he amid the Mountaines hie A fielde to folde, did chaunce to cast his raunging eyes to Skie In cleare and quiete starrie night: and sawe by fortune there The order of the Heauens, and how the starres disposed were. And more than these bisides ywis: but fast declining Sunne Will not permit as now we should prolong our talke begunne. The .ix. Egloge entituled FALCO. The Argument. Here Faustul hauing throughly tryde the nature of the Romaine ground: The vilenesse of the soyle, and Shep- hierds filthy manners doth expound. The speakers names. Faustulus. Candidus. Faustulus. O Candid howe befals that thou from natiue home A wight exilde in forraine land and strangie Realme dost rome? For here no Pastures are nor Fountaines to be found, No safe Sheepecoates, no shrouding shades, to keepe the cattle sound. Candidus. Thus (Faustul) stands the case, one Coridon that in These quarters kept his flock, and by that meane great wealth did win, Draue me to deeme that here amyd these Mountaines was Most pleasant Pasture for my Sheepe, and holsome vaine of grasse. But sithens now I see and plainly viewe with eye, The barren ground &amp; Pastures pielde, soile rockie, Fountaines drie, It yrks me that I came so rashly out of dore, The iourneys long, and leauing of my Countrey grieues me sore. Faustulus. Well since it was thy happe in safetie to attaine The Latine Pastures, I would craue (if thou wilt take the paine) To my poore house to come, of fellowship do so, I haue fewe akers here of lande to liue vpon, no mo Than poorely will maintaine my lowe and needie state: But such as 'tis, take parte I pray let runne in common rate. Perhaps some better hap and fortune will befall. For Chaunce resembles much a blast of winde, to wauering thrall. Come to my sedgie Coate till raging heate be past, And whilst the flock layd downe on soile do chewe the Cud full fast. Do way the Sheepecrooke, sit thee downe and tipple square: We neede to drinke, by drinke we shall auoide this scorching care. Take thou the Cruse in hande, for after drinke (they say) The tale with better grace is tolde it better goes away. Candidus. What mad man would in such a heate refuse the Cup? Faustulus. Yea, Wine doth quel the cruell thirst if it be tippled vp. Wine doth diminish care and dolours of the minde: As wine breedes friendships, so it doth augment the strength by kinde. Candidus. This Countrey hath good Grapes, if so they here do growe. Faustulus. Fill out againe, the former draught is but a tast you knowe. The seconde weates the iawes, the third doth coole the rage Of burning mouth, the fourth w? thirst a cruel warre doth wage. The fift full fiercely fights, the sixt doth conquer aye, The seauenth triumphs, Oenophilus earst so was wont to say. Candidus. 'Tis wisdome to incline and followe sounde aduise, 'Tis for the profite to giue eare to aged Fathers wise. Now thirst is conquerd well, yet naythelesse my harte Is pensiue aye, &amp; thoughtful care augments my wonted smart. Faustulus. As thirst is banisht, so the minde shall purchase ease: Fill out the licour of the Grape, drincke freely if you please. This Physick is to driue the heart pangs out of place. Rome to abandon cruell cares this Medcine vsde like case. Candidus. All toile and trauaile craues a time of rest and stay, Let bottle stande, and stoppe him close to keepe the Flies away. The day is nothing wette, not deawie is the night, Which makes that forrage c? not grow but is consumed quight. Fell famine, cruell toile, with heate of scortching aire Haue made the Cattle passing leane, and brought them in dispaire Of euer being fat: scarce can they drawe their winde, Their guts are clung to emptie skinne, the bones sticke out behinde. This Ramme that beate the Woulfe with horne and bounsing brow, Is weaker than a Sheepe, a Lambe doth passe his courage now. Thus much the Crow declarde with holy sacred bill: But I was ouerhastly bent to followe raging will. Scarce was I out of dore but he was straight at hande, And bringing yll abodement, gan on houses top to stande Upon the lefter side, and with an angrie beake With open signe of fell myssehap aloude began to squeake O most vnhappie beast, that wonted wert of yore When on our soile thou feddst, to bring of Milke and Cattle store, Nowe seeking Pastures newe, more kindely strength dost misse By wearie trauaile, than by foode thou gained hast ywisse. Here both we faint yfeare, thou with thy slender fare, And I poore wight in sunder crusht with cruel girding care. Now is our countrey stuft with wealth: what Medow grounds Haue we? What pastures greene as leeke within our Countrey bounds? O merrie ioyfull soile, and fertile fieldes to see, Where aye is Corne vpon the grounde and where fresh riuers bee Aye passing through the Townes and Burroughs where we woonne, And where through erie Uillage and eche Garden flouds do roonne. This makes the goodly flocks and Pasture fieldes so fatte. When crabbed Cancer rules, and men do plie the threshing batte, And scortching Iulie scaldes: the fieldes do flourish greene, The Apples grow in euery hedge. amid the brakes are seene Sweete smelling floures euery where and pleasaunt to the nose, In eche bush there standes on stalke of euery hue a Rose. O pleasant shade of Groues and sound of trembling leaues, Which earst (I minde) with thee I had among the shadie greaues. Where we the Turtles plaint and Swallowes songs did heare And Philomelas sundrie tunes, when Locusts first appeare, That make the Groues to ring with shrill and shrieking cries, The aire that shooke the leauie boughs from Eurus did arise. Aloft our heads the tree that Cornus hight there hangde, Whose boistrous armes were all about with Berries brauely spangde. I sitting on the grounde sawe how the beasts did sporte, And tender Lambs with hurtlesse horns did fight in friendly sorte. And when that sleepe was past, or staring to the Skies. I blewe my Pipe, or else did sing what best I mought deuise. Another while I would layd gruffe vpon the grasse, Pluck Strawberies fr? slender stalkes the time away to passe. Faustulus. Then happie was thy life, thou wert a blessed wight, But of that friendly Fortune thou didst take no greate delight. Thou scorndst that present state, a worsse not hauing tride, And that procurde that Fortune so away from thee did glide. When so it coms againe, (if euer thou haue the happe) Euen as the braunches of the Uine the propping poastes do lappe, And them enuiron growe fast clasping them about: So catch hir with thy hands, and caught let hir no way get out. She goes and makes returne, and often chaungeth hue: Much like the Heggs that by reporte about the Mountaines flue, And rangled in the darke and shadie Mist of night. And as this Fortune shifts hir lookes, and chops and chaungeth sight, So wandring is hir minde, meere iestings are hir ioyes: Looke what she gaue she takes againe, no reason, all in toyes. The man that feares the worst, or warely lookes about, She scornes and as an abiect hates, she shuts the Dastard out. Candidus. As oft as we to minde do call our Countrey soile We can not paciently endure this wofull wearie toile. But whether run my wits that am tormented thus? To double present woe do I now think on former blisse? Now merrie May is come, the Uine is greene to viewe, Now Corne hath taken eire, Pomegra- nats are of golden hiewe. Eche where the bushes smell, the Elder trees are white Within our Countrey, al about both Pade and Mince in sight. But here yet scarcely do the Groues begin to bood, And if so be that in the spring the ground be dead, by th' Rood What will it do when force of Winter coms in place, And soile is clad with frostie clothes or scalding Sommers blase? Yet here are hierds of beastes with slick and finest skin, Upon whose boistrous brauned neckes the yoake hath neuer bin: Whose forheads hardned are with double horne to see, No doubt, vnlesse they fed agood, they could not lightly bee Deawlapped so before with dangles hanging downe. Faustulus. These beasts whose loftie heads &amp; lokes are lifted hie from groune, And haue such spindle shankes and goe with loftie gates: Deuoure vp all, first grasse, and then they make the boughs their cates. With vpward reaching iawes and greedie gaping chappe, They chew the chiefest pasture gro?ds and trees in sunder snappe. This weake and siellie beast that only feedes on grasse That growes on gro?d, doth fast ful oft in Pastures bare as glasse. Candidus. What needes such lauish talke? all liuing things of kind Haue this condition, aye the small the great his foe doth finde. The Lambe is praie to Woulfe, to Eagle gentle Doues, The Delphin hunts the hurttesse fish that in the wallowe moues. How coms this geare about? a monstrous thing it is. This place, if from aloft thou looke will seeme to be ywis Good pasture ground and fine, as full of grasse as needes: But how much neerer that you come, the more appeare the weedes, Then shewes the filth his kinde, then plainly 'tis discride. Faustulus. Rome is to men as to the birds the Owle with visage wide, She sits vpon a stocke, and like a stately Queene With loftie becks she cals a farre the Birds that nie hir beene. The route suspecting nought togither come apace, They maruell at hir picked eares and gastly glewing face, And at hir Monstrous head and crooked bending byll: Whilst thus (I say) they hoppe about not minding any yll, From sprig to sprig, from bough to bough, from tree to tree, Some threaded are with limed lace, with twigs some other bee Ycaught: thus all as pray vnto the Broach do goe. Candidus. O this is passing, nothing can be better sayde I trowe. But see how yonder Snake with crooked crawling pace Glides on the grauell ground, and as he commeth to the place With thirstie gaping iawes and tong infectes the aire. Faustulus. O Candid minde well what I say, let to thy breast repaire, What time thou wandrest in the wood thine eyes defende And garde with hat, for bushie thornes their poinant pricks pretende To noy thy face, and if thou take not great good heede The crooked hanging brimbles will rent off thy crooked weede. Do not away thy Crooke, haue bosome full of stones, Least some newe vnexpected foe oppresse thee for the nones. Put on thy Cokers eke and stirteps to beware, The bushie Groues are ful of Snakes, with bite they breede our care, In daylie hazard of our liues, and now the Sommer makes Their poysoned Uenom ranckle sore where so by chaunce it takes. A thousand Wolues there be, as many Foxes here Belowe in bottome of the Uale, that do not yet appere. And (monstrous thing to speake) my selfe haue seene with eye Men Woulflie shape and manners put in proufe and practize I, That with their flocks haue dealt too cruelly in deede, And all imbrude with slaughter of their beasts they forst to bleede. The neighbour places laugh, nor feare the cruell spoile, Nor once will go about to stoppe this greedie bloudie broile. And oftentimes appeare fell vglie shapes to sight, Which earth by influence vile brings forth, sometime the Dogs do fight And vse such cruell rage, as farre they do surpasse The tyrannie of bloudie Wolues: that route that rampire was And garde to flocks of yore, put on a wrathfull minde, And slay the siellie Cattle that their fortune is to finde. In Ægypt men report they honourd certaine beasts And sundrie coumpted Gods to be with pompe and solemne feasts. That superstition was deseruing lesser blame Than ours, for we to euery beast a seuerall Altar frame: A thing contrary quite to God, and lawes of kinde. For he ordainde a man as heade and chiefe of brutish kinde. And sundrie times the hote and scalding Sommers rayes And plagie yeare approcheth fast, that euery beast decayes About the open fieldes: the sucking Lambe that cries At deade Dams teate himselfe with vile disease on sodaine dies. Euen vnderneath the yoake the Oxen leese their breath, And as they trauaile in the way yelde life to cruell death. No reason in the plague, no Physicke to aslake This venome vile, and poysonde filth: but house from house doth take Infection of the same, and drinkes vp deadly sore, And dayly so contagion of this poyson growes to more. This plague kils lightly no fell sauage bluddie beast, The yong ones prosper too too well, the Wolues make gladsome feast And rend with ruthlesse chaps our siellie cattle that But lately dide, and by our losse thus Wolues do waxen fat. Candidus. Alas unhappie I, what rash and foolish moode Drewe me? who so doth credit fame, I think him mad and wood. Of Romaine hils I heard, of stately Tyber eake, And men of goodlie Romaine roofes and buildings earst did speake. I out of hand had great desire to see the same, And leade my life within a soile that was of such a name. With halfe my hierd I came (a mad man in my thought) For whie with me both Tent and all my Shephierds trinckets brought Throughout the Mountaines hie, Pailes, Pans ymade of brasse, With Caldrons, Cheesefat eke, and all the rest that fittest was For making of the Cheese, and so it was my hap To lose my troublous trauaile and my charges at a clap. Alas what shall I doe? which way my selfe conuart? The hoped pleasures are denied, there are in erie parte So many daungerous haps, so sundrie perils prest, As I am driuen vnto my Coate againe to take my reft: Constrainde of force to say and graunt it ill begunne, The toile I toke in hand of late by heate of scalding sunne, By wearie trauaile home to flocks I am enforst to runne. Alas vnhappie hierd, O Shephierd yll accurst, More better had it bene for thee if thou hadst staide at furst At home in natiue soile, and there haue waxen olde (Than thither to haue rashly come) wher thou moughtst haue b? bold In countrey well beknowne of thee, and coast exceeding colde: And Padus banckes about, and Athesis too strayde, Or there wher Myncius twhart y? fields and Pastures runnes vnstaide. Or else where Abdua with his siluer chanel flowes To haue remainde, and fed thy hierde with sweete and holsome bowes. Faustulus. This light beliefe of thine, both thee and me beguiles, For I haue seene those greedie wights that longd to climbe erewhiles And sate in pleasures mount, from praised goods to slip, Nor could escape: Experience causeth men beware the whip. The warie children trie and wisely looke about, Nor follow ery liked thing though braggers boast it out. Now chiefest things theyr laude and earned praise do want, That were of yore right worthy fame, (all these I needes must graunt) Whose names alone remaine: as Lune and Adria eake, And Saluya with auncient Troie of whome did Umber speake. But (as I sayd) the names are now aliue and left, The rest ingratefull wasting Time and fretting Age hath rest. Though now of lesser laude and praise our Countrey bee, Yet better is the thing perhaps. Eche man aliue doth see And knowes what great renoume Rome euer had ere this: The fame (good fayth) as yet remaines, the auncient gaine begis And profit is supprest. Those flouds that earst did flowe Atwhart the fields and Pasture gro?ds, finde lacke of licour nowe. Drie are the Wellie vaines, the moisture quite is gone, No cloud doth shoure, nor Tyber glides. the gasping fieldes vppon. Time auncient Conduites hath and leaden Pipes defast, The Towres are in decay: wherfore hence hence (my Goates) in hast. Here woons but famine nowe, here want of wealth doth raigne: Yet here (they say) doth dwell, and we our selues haue seene it plaine A Shephierd, one that of the Falcon, Falco hight, Well storde of fleezie Sheepe, for Pa- sture grounds a wealthie wight. That in his Songs excels the antique Poets, and The skilfull Orpheus that both woods and rockes about the land By force of Musike drew, the rest of Romaine race He so farre doth surpasse (a straunge and monstrous vgglie case) As Padus Tybers streame, and Abdua Macras flood, The Willow Bulrush, Thistle Rose, the Seaweedes Popple wood. We thinke him not vnlike that noble worthie wight Whose Altars Maro made to shine twelue dayes with sacred light. This Shephierd kepes his flocks, with farre more watchfull care Than Argus did that in his head a hundreth watchmen bare. And Daphnis not alone, but that Apollo eake That fed Admetus hierd in Thes- sale soile as Poets speake. Well worthie to succeede and take the charge in hand Of Fisher that forewent his nets, and kept his Sheepe at land. He knowes the way to garde his cattle, how to driue Diseases from infected flocke, and saue his Lambs aliue: Moist eke the Pasture groundes, giue grasse, let riuers goe, And reconcile the mightie Ioue, abandon theeuish foe. Beate off the barking Woulfe, that seekes the beasts to kill. O Candid here make thy abode if so be Falcos will: But if he once restraine his fauour and his grace, Driue thou away the hierde, and haste to seeke a better place. FINIS.</field>
