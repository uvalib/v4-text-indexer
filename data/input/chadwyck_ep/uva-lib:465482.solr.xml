      <field name="fulltext">MANUDUCTIO ad COELUM. A POEM. PART I. Of Joy and Sadness. How a good Man ought to rejoyce. He that looks before him is not cast down. Several Antidotes against Sorrow. I. Joy, when it once doth so excessive grow, That it all Bounds of Reason doth or'e-flow, Draws ever after't, as we daily find, A total Dissolution of the Mind. We then must have a prudent care of that, And likewise must our Joys so moderate, That if need be from Mirth, to Grief we may Dispose our selves, act readily each way. Our blessed Saviour, who must sure be thought The ablest Arbiter of things, says not Those are the Blest that laugh, and frollick here, But they that Mourn the truly Blessed are. It were indeed a strange indecency For one that doth profess himself to be Pursuant of the great Eternity, Among so many perils that are found Daily the All of Man to Circle round, So many just occasions as there are Of sadness, to be always Gigling here, Making of antick mouths, and like a Boy Laughing to transport for each trifling Toy. This Worlds sugacious Pleasures, and the Joys Of which we talk, and make so great a Noise, Are frequently observ'd to be the Fate, And Prodromus of a most anxious state: There neither true nor solid Joy can be, But in a Conscience just, serene and free, He that doth cherish, and take care o'th' one, Shall find the other his Companion, For in his Breast it grows, there takes delight, And baffles all the efforts of base despight. All other Joy, but what proceeds from this, Wants substance, and but light and trivial is; And there are those that Laugh, who in that while Of their false Mirth, have little cause to smile. True Joy a serious matter is, and there Must be a Conscience from Pollutions clear, Intentions honest, Actions most upright, A great contempt of this vain Worlds delight, And the continu'd Series of a fair Unspotted Life, for to maintain it here. There never can be perfect Joy without Impartial Justice, Temp'rance, and a stout Undaunted Courage, that is resolute. This Virtue's Method is, at first to weep, And ever after Halcyon days to keep. II. Sadness, the black'st of Passions, is defin'd To be a perturbation of the Mind, Which from some present Evil takes its rise, That either real, or conceived is. This fetters all our Senses, pulleth down Heav'ns Image, Reason, from her rightful Throne, And in her room, by Fancies pow'rful Charm, Sets up a feigned Ill to work our Harm. By which we oft-times to our selves create, And find more trouble in the fond Coneit Of Things, than in the Things themselves can er'e Be found, if strictly they examin'd were. Wherefore be not too sedulous to know, And prie into the state of things below, How with our selves, or others, matters stand Concerning Servants, Moneys, Business, Lands; But rather take into regard th'esteem, And real judgement which we have of them. 'Tis not within the Pow'r of any Wight, Of greatest Wit or Courage, clearest sight, By one, or all together, that can free Himself from Force, Disgrace, or Robbery. But this is in his Pow'r to undertake, An upright judgment of these things to make, And to content himself that they are not Entirely Evil, as by him they're thought, But often-times (if he but wisely knows To manage them) prove advantageous. He that is under present Trouble brought, Though ne're so great, let him but bend his thought To a good guarded Conscience, which a sure And lasting Comfort is, and there's his Cure. To a good Man nothing can come amiss, Not that he feels not what sad Mis'ry is, But he doth master't, and considers all Bitter Afflictions that do him befall, Only as matter for his Patience to Be busi'd on, lest it should idle grow; Or as the Instrument, and means of Grace, And that which opens him a way to pass Into Eternal Glory, where the Blest No Sorrows know, but undisturbed rest. A good man may be thought unhappy, though, If rightly judg'd, he never can be so. III. It doth extreamly much abate the keen Edge of Misfortune, when it is foreseen; And to our selves to state the matter thus, Whatever may be, shall fall out to us; For he that's thus prepar'd can never be Plung'd in surprizes of a Miserie. All kind of Disappointments heavy fall Upon those Men whose thoughts, and actions all Are fixt upon Prosperity, as that Which they account to be the happiest state. What if a man should lose the half, or all Of his Estate? What if his House should fall? His Corn be blasted? and his Friends should leave Him, when his needs doth their assistance crave? What if his Credit should endanger'd be? (Than which no greater Evil he can see) His Office ta'ne away? his honour'd Gown Turn'd or'e his Ears, for Crimes to him unknown? And to all this let's add tormenting Pain, Bondage, from which he ne're can freedom gain, Till welcome Death knocks off th'uneasie Chain. A frightful Ruin, laying all things waste, And Fire devouring with dispatchful haste: All this to no more comes, than what each wise And prudent Man's prepar'd for, and foresees. There is no worldly Misery that is known, Which he beforehand has not thought upon, And made as easie to be born by him, By long considering on't from time to time, As others by long sust'rance make't, to whom A second Nature 'tis almost become. That which to any Man may come to pass, May be (for ought we know) each Persons Case. Where's the Rich Man that can himself secure From pinching Hunger, or from being Poor? Where's the great Man that wholly is exempt From foul Disgrace, or Scorners base Contempt? Where is the Kingdom (altho' ne're so great, So rich and Pop'lous) or the Nation that May not be overturn'd, and have not one Soul left therein, its most sad Fate to moan? Have we not liv'd to see, with our own Eyes, A Great, and Glorious Prince, Religious, Wise, Whose Equal never any Kingdom had, Brought to the Fatal Block, there lose his head, By his own Subjects impious command, And this perform'd by th'common Hang-man's hand? A Villany beyond Example great! And such as of the like no Book doth treat. Yet these prodigeous Changes mention'd here, Not Works of long and tedious Ages are, There but a Moment's difference doth lye 'Twixt flowing Plenty, and starv'd Beggery, The glorious costly-Court, and the most mean, Cold-ragged Cottage of the poorest Man; A lofty Throne, adorn'd with Gems of price, And a rais'd Scaffold where the Pris'ner dyes. This is the strangely variable state Of Humane things, so very fickle, that What was to day another Persons Lot, May be to Morrow mine, as well as not; No Man endures ill Fortune with less harm, Than he that always doth expect its Storm. IV. Virtue has in Prosperity but small, Or no occasion to appear at all. But in that dismal Melancholy Hour Of sad Adversity, her Conqu'ring Pow'r Is in our Patience manifested so, That to her strength the stoutest Troubles bow. We are become a Spectacle (saith Paul) To God, and Angels, Men in general. And 'tis a sight in which God takes delight, To see a brave Man with ill Fortune fight; With head-strong Passions, and all Casualties, (Those his confounding stubborn Enemies) And in great Triumph leading, as he goes, All his Domestick and his Forreign Foes. A Pilot's skill is not discern'd at all In Governing a Ship, when under Sail In a smooth quiet Sea, and gentle Gale. And He that is not try'd, hath this mischance To live in an unfruitful Ignorance. And yet when try'd how apt are most of us Unwisely to complain, and cry out thus— Most miserable Men, that ever we Should have endur'd so great Calamity! When as most happy Men (say I) we are, That by this means have gain'd this profit here, That with great Honour, and brave Constancy, We have bore up our selves in Misery; Where others would perchance have shrunk, or fell Under the Burthen, which we manag'd well. We therefore are not to give up, and yield Our selves, but stoutly must maintain the Field, In Crosses and Disasters, and there stand Firm to encounter all their dreadful Band. For 'tis but bravely standing to their Front, And breaking of their first and furious Brunt, And we shall find the rest to be no more But Fancy and Opinion, of no Pow'r. The Works of Nature in all Persons are Found to be all alike, no Blame's in Her. But for Discredit, Contumely, low Despised Poverty, and what else we know Are Evils call'd by the ignoble Rout, Who seldom have a right well guided thought, Some there are known who do endure them all With a submissive Patience, and they fall On others who no reck'ning of them make, Nor notice of them in the least do take. So that 'tis not the force (as some Men own) Of any Natural Impression That we do labour under, but 'tis hence, From a perverse Opinion's Influence. Why then should Man so horridly belie Himself, and call that a Calamity, A Burthen insupportable, which he May order so, that it shall easie be? Let him but his Opinion change of it, And then 'twill easie on his Shoulders sit. Each Man is just as miserable as Upon himself he doth a judgment pass; And let him still complain of what he will, Yet there is no Affliction half so ill As his impatience, this is of the two The greater Mischief, and most harm will do. V. Is there a Sickness, or a Pain so great, So very stubborn, and so obstinate, That in some measure Time will not allay, Or take it from us utterly away? If so, the Question is, Whether 'tis fit That we our selves should put an end to it; Or whether we with Patience should attend Till it without us cometh to an end? For Time, to whom all Earthly things must bow, Will most assuredly at last that do; Which common Prudence at the present might Better perform, would it assert it's right. Nay, had we ne're so prone, so great a Will, To entertain and cherish in us still Bewitching Melancholy, 'twould depart At length, in spight of all our Pow'r and Art. 'Tis true, that Grief when it is fresh i'th' mind, May Tenderness, and much Compassion find; But when it waxeth old, it apish grows, Than which there's nothing that's more odious. If an unhappy Wretch advantag'd were By sobbing and lamenting, he should ne're By me be hinder'd, but have my consent That's Days and Nights in Sighs and Groans be spent, In all the Outrages that er'e was known By a dejected Creature to be done; But if our Howling and our Crying be Of no advantage in our Miserie, Let's to victorious Resolutions fly, And fight our troubles till they vanguish'd lye. That Pilot merits to be thrown o're-Bord That in a Storm will not his skill afford, But quits the Helm, and sets the Ship adrift, In that great danger for her self to shift. But he that stands with a Courageous heart, Firm to his Tackle, and with all his Art Bears briskly up against the Storm, though He Should with the Vessel over-whelmed be, Yet dies with Honour and the Comfort too Of having done what he was bound to do. PART II. Of Patience, the Occasions and Effects of it. The Signs of it. An Exhortation to it, with Instructions how to behave our selves in Adversity. The necessity of Perseverance. I. Patience a Virtue is, that makes Mankind To bear Affliction with an even mind. But as of Mis'ries sev'ral sorts there are, Some more vexatious, and some less, so there Are sev'ral Names which fitly we bestow On humble Patience, suitable unto The various Evils which it is to be Practic'd upon, to try its Constancy. Patience, so called properly, is this; An Heav'nly Gift of bearing Injuries, Without the least disturbance of the Mind, And with a Courage not to be confin'd When it relates to the low worthless things, (Which oft-times trouble to the Owner bring,) The loss of Worldly Goods, and Fortune, we Give it the Name of Equanimitie. And that which buoys the Heart up (which the fear And Fountain is of active Life, and Heat) In the delays, and the defeat of some Expected Good, which ne're is found to come, We have a proper genuine Name, which we Express this by, call'd Longanimitie. But the Heroick Virtue which defends And fortifies us to all other ends, Which doth support and comfort us in all The Griefs, and Miseries that do us befal, Is known by the all-glorious Name, which we Deserv'dly give't, unshaken Constancie. A Virtue which all others doth exeed, And which we more than all the rest do need. 'Tis not for nothing that Mans Life is here A Warfare call'd, consid'ring how we are With Foes beset, what Troops of Mischiefs break Dayly into us, their Revenge to wreak. There's not a nimble Moment slips away Without a fierce Assault, and furious Fray; And if we had no spiteful Foes without, Yet we should find it work enough to rout Those cruel ones which in our Bosoms lie, Strugling with us to gain a Victory. We breed and Harbour Enemies enow, Within our selves to work our overthrow; That give no respite, but do all they can To torture, and disturb the Soul of Man. Weeping we come into the World, and so We live in it, and so do forth of't go. 'Tis the first thing we learn, in our young Morn, And Dawn of Years, so soon as we are Born; And we can find our Eyes with Tears distil, When we of nothing else are capable. Divers there are upon Record, who while They here convers'd were never known to smile, But we ne're heard of any Person yet Whose Eyes a pensive-Tear did never let. It therefore doth concern us all to be With Patience arm'd, without which Virtue we No Noble Conquest o're our Foes can gain, Nor e're Perfections glorious height attain. No Mortal knows the Luster of this Gem, Nor rightly how to give't its due Esteem; Till he doth read it, that's to say, till He Is plung'd into the Sea of Misery. Never was any prudent Person known To be impatient in Affliction. II. He has the more to fear, and justly too, That never yet did Adverse Fortune know: The learn'd Physicians do in this agree, There may too good a state of Body be; And that there nothing is more dang'rous than A Plethory unto the Health of Man. So a dead Calm at Sea, the Sea-men cry, Is a Fore-runner of a Storm that's nigh. If we are under the unpleasant stroke Of froward Accidents, we are not to look Upon it as a Cruelty, or own We undergo a Persecution; But a Contest, which will our Temples Crown With a Victorious Wreath, and gain Renown. Without a Fight there can no Conquest be, And Triumph none, without a Victory. Now if our Captain of Salvation was Himself to suffer, and this way to pass Into his Glory, shall such Worms as we, Such abject Creatures, think to go Scot-free, And Gratis be partakers made of what Another hath at such a dear rate bought. He that doth think by any other way, Than through Afflictions Door, to enter Joy, Deceives himself, for Tribulation is The Rode chalk'd out unto the Seat of Bliss. A Christians Sacramental Oath is this, To do all good, and suffer Injuries. Lively to Paint, and the true Tokens show, Of a most perfect Patience, come we now. He that has reach'd that happy Point doth bear All adverse Fortune that befalls him here, And in the height of all his Woes is known To show no Signs of Reluctation: He murmurs not under the scourging Rod, Nor Ill for Ill returns, but always good. He loves his Foes with an unseigned Love, And to the Throne of the great God above Sends up his Pray'rs in the behalf of those Who seek to Rob him of his sweet Repose. He sees the gentle hand of the most High In his Afflictions, and submissively Sits down, and either nothing says at all, Or for Relief to none but Heav'n doth call, Resolv'd with Joy and thankfulness to bear What God sees fit to lay upon him here. To Sum up all, it is an high degree Of Patience to endure contentedly The wrong our Brother doth us, though the Man Be to us as injurious as he can. III. When we do lose our Worldly Goods, 'tis no Small comfort to us some time to bestow A serious thought on their uncertain state, And how, when once encreas'd, they do abate. What er'e we love, or in this World possess, A flitting Fugitive by Nature is; It is with us indeed, but by just right It is not ours, nor can we stay it's flight. And we are not to fool ourselves, and run Into a vain and needless Passion, For a fantastick thought our idle Brain, Of their continuance here, doth entertain. For we to every thing uncertain are, Whereas we firmly should to it adhere; And therefore can expect that ought should be Constant to us, for our Inconstancy. Virtue the only thing excepted is, This truly's that which doth immortalize Mortality it selfe; all else we find Carry their Death with them, and are but Wind Betwixt our selves and our Possessions then, Let's keep a distance wide enough, for when They come to mingle and incorporate, He takes our Heart, that taketh our Estate. A good Man cannot properly be said, To suffer loss of any thing he had, For whatsoer'e of Wealth or Honour can Be from him took, is no part of the Man; But somewhat added to his Person, that, Whether it stays or goes, he values not, Esteeming not himselfe to be at all Richer, or Poorer, let what will befal. O what a deal of pudder do we make, How loud our Out-cries and our Sorrows speak, When we our Mony lose, or when from us, Death takes a Child, or fire consumes our House! But we can leave our Virgin Modesty, Part with our Virtue, and our Constancy, And not so much as in our Faces show A conscious Blush, when any of them go. And yet we here, without a troubled thought, Lose a substantial Good, and more then that, We likewise part with what's our own, whereas In th'other Case we let not either pass. He that Laments for such a triffling loss, Deserves to feel the Worlds severest Cross. If 'twere not for a strange disorder'd Love, (Which to our Peace the fatal'st Foe doth prove) We should not then this falsity believe, We ought had lost that this vain World can give. For what are outward things, what profit can Their poor enjoyments give the inward Man? Or betwixt Wisdom and our Money, what True Correspondence can there well be thought? IV. It would do well, in whatsoever we Do goe about, to show such Prudencie, As to take in the Adjuncts that attend The Thing on which our busie thoughts we bend. For there are many Circumstances that, For want of heed and fore-sight, may create Vexation to us, and such Tempests raise, That will disturb our sweet Repose and Joys, I call my Servant, and perchance it may Be his misfortune to be out o'th' way; Or else he idle stands, and does not go About the Bus'ness which I'd have him do. I am to make a Visit, who knows but The Man will not be seen, or else may shut, The Door against me, and refuse to me Admittance, valuing not my Company. Suppose but this beforehand, and we shall Think all is well, and never vex at all. It is the wambling of a nauseous mind, (The chief Disease that reigns in Woman-kind,) To fret and brawl, because that such a one Admittance had, where I was bid be-gon. I could not get so much as one poor Word With such a Person, at his well-fill'd Board, Down to the lower end I crowded was, When I deserv'd to have the chiefest place. He that's not mov'd with this, no notice takes At all of it, into no Passion breaks. And he that understands it not to be Matter of Course, and meer Formality, Without dispute must be concluded one That to th'Affairs of Humane life's unknown. If we can mend it let us, and if not, Like Virtue's Souldiers let us take our Lot. We daily apt are loudly to exclaim Against the Evils of our Age, to blame Sly Malice, Impudence, and Wickedness, And we do well, and prudently in this, If we can but reform the World, and drive Out of't the Fools and Knaves that in it live. But if this will not be, our Prudence ought To teach our Tongues not to be finding fault; Since 'tis no new device for men to go In their own way, and what they please to do. Why don't we rather turn the blame upon Our selves, for hoping what can ne're be done? The World was never otherwise, nor e're Will other be, while we continue here; As long as there are Men, there faults will be, Should they remain unto Eternitie. V. He that doth labour under any weight Of sad Affliction, be it small or great, Should wisely ponder not so much upon What are his Suffrings, as what he has done. And what he now so highly doth resent, Esteeming it a rig'rous Punishment, Will then be found, as it deserves to be, A gentle Mercy, not Severitie: And that the strokes of this reforming Rod Are laid upon him by Almighty-God To work his good, to make him more submiss, To try and harden him in Miseries, And so reclaim him, that his Reason may O're all his Passions have a Sov'raign sway. They that enjoy their fill of Pleasure here, Oft kept for Torments in the next World are, He that doth tumble in his dearest Gold, And smiling-Plenty in his Arms doth hold, Who knows how He'd behave himself, shou'd He Feel the hard state of Want and Penurie? Or with what firmness any Person wou'd Abide the Rage and Odium of the Crowd; That by their favour, almost all his Days, High marks of Honour has receiv'd, and Praise? We're Prompt enough our Comforts to apply, And give advice to men in Misery; Why don't we rather to our Discontents. Afford these choice and healing Documents; And turn th'Advice upon our selves, when God Gives us a taste of his reforming Rod? We can submit unto the Chyrurgion's Art, To save the Body, with a gladsome Heart, Can lose a Limb, and for the smarting-Blow Thank him, and for his pains reward him too. Affliction is Gods Remedy, and this, For the Souls Health, in some Distempers, is As needful as Consuming fire can be To Cauterize a Gangreen'd Maladie: And yet we are extreamly prone to break Into ingrate Complaints, and to mistake, And look on that to be a mighty loss, And Misery, which is not so to us, But in the intention, and in the Effect, Is a safe Cure, and doth our Good respect. If Poverty, Sickness, or whatever we Do Evil call, might but supposed be To take upon them this unheard-of Task, To Reason with us, and these Questions ask; ‘Sirs, What's your Quarrel to us? Very fain ‘We'd know what hurt you do by us sustain? ‘Have we been known at any time so rude, ‘To take your Justice, Prudence, Fortitude; ‘Or any thing besides that good was known, ‘And you could call in proper Terms your own? ‘May you not with us, as without us be ‘As free from Cares, and live as Merrily? To this we ought not, nor should dare to speak, Silence must here the only answer make. The Matter duly weigh'd, and understood, We Good for Ill do take, and Ill for Good. And our impatience is the most severe, And greatest Evil that befals us here. VI. In the concerns of others, it may be We so may act Arts of Hypocrisie, And show such Symptoms of a constant mind, And Speech so well compact, that it would blind The most discerning Eye; but in our own Our cunning fails us, and the Cheat is shown. Our Duty 'tis to shed a Pious Tear, With those that Weep, and in Affliction are; But though our Tears in common be, there's no Reason the Cause of them must be so too. We are as much as in us lies, to be A Friend to those who are in Misery, If we receive an injury, let this Be well consider'd, that there nothing is That can befall us, but there doth belong Two handles to't, a right one, and a wrong; Take it but by the right, and then we shall Not look upon our selves as wrong'd at all. The Man's unjust. If we do take't that way, These Furies haunt us, which our Peace destroy; Revengful Anger, and wild Violence, Which make a Mountain of each small Offence. But if we take it on the other side, He's one for whom the Blessed Jesus dy'd; Redeem'd with us by the same precious Blood, To the same Glory called out, and woo'd; The turning of our thoughts this way, be sure Will to our minds a lasting Calm procure. We likewise may (and herein Wisdom's shown) Upon it pass this short reflexion; In matter of reproof we sooner shall, From a professed Foe the truth of all Our Follies hear, than from a Bosom Friend, For 'tis his study to find faults, and bend His most malicious Pow'rs to search into Our weakness more, and stricter than we do; If we commit the thing that we should not, Or do neglect to do the thing we ought, We shall be sure to hear on't, for he'l soon Blazon our failings over all the Town. Let's therefore walk so warily, that we May make some profit of his Enmitie, And we shall be more careful when we know That there's a Spy upon what-er'e we do. VII. Of all our Virtues Constancy's the Crown, And the Perfection. The Reward alone Is promis'd to beginners, yet 'tis ne're Deliver'd but to those that persevere. Wherefore above all other things let's be Masters of a resolved Constancie. In the ascending to the lofty Top Of a steep Mountain, if we once but stop, In stead of standing on its slipp'ry side, We down again unto the bottom slide. First let's resolve on what we are to do, And then with fervour let us that pursue; For none but he that is not in his Wits, Will trifle's business off to do't by fits. It is a weakness of the mind to be Roving, and seeking of fresh Company, New sports, new places, when the fault of this Wholly in us, not in the Climate is, Or other Circumstances which we are Willing to charge with all our Follies here. The tender Plant by oft removing dies, And oftentimes the change of Remedies Plungeth the Patient (which would else do well) Into a Sickness that's incurable. If the Divine Apostle at a loss I'th' Contemplation of his Duty was, What will become of us, frail Creatures here, Whose Virtues scarcely comparable are Ev'n to his Imperfections, whereof he So much complain'd in his Mortalitie. The love of Learning endless is, nor can Extinguish'd be, while there remains a Man. The love of Riches never is to be Suffic'd, although we heaps on heaps do see. And the fond love of fading Honour ne're Will be allay'd, while we Corruption bear. So that we must this certain truth confess, That there's no end of all our greediness After the things, which in their Nature are So short-liv'd found, and so uncertain here. But when we come unto that all Divine And lasting Wisdom, which would make us shine Among the Blest, and give us endless Joys, Then the least touch and relish of it Cloys. But this is not according to his known And sacred Precept, that commands each one To be as perfect as the God of Bliss, Our good and Heav'nly Father, perfect is. He that looks up but with a willing Mind To that Example, shall not fail to find A copious place for the encrease of each Virtue of his, till he Perfection reach. FINIS.</field>
