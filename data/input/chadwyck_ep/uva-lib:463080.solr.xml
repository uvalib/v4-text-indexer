      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE BEGINNING, ACCIDENTS, AND END OF THE WAR OF TROY. Whilom in Troy, that ancient noble town, Did dwell a king of honour and renown, Of port, of puissance, and mickle fame, And Priam was this mighty prince's name; Whom, in regard of his triumphant state, The world as then surnam'd the fortunate, So happy was he for his progeny, His queen, his court, his children, and country: Yclypped stately Hecuba was she, So fair a creature hardly might you see, So brave, and of so comely personage; And, long before she tasted fortune's rage, With twenty sons and daughters, wondrous thing, This lusty lady did enrich her king, Fruit not unlike the tree whereof they sprong; The daughters lovely, modest, wise, and yong; The sons, as doth my story well unfold, All knights at arms, gay, gallant, brave and bold, Of wit and manhood such as might suffice, To venture on the highest piece of service: His peers as loyal to their royal lord, As might ne tainted be for deed or word; His court presenting to our earthly eyes, A sky of stars, or shining paradise. Thus happy, Priam, didst thou live of yore, That to thy hap could nought be added more: Till 'mong the gods I wot not what was he Envying tho this happiness to thee, Or goddess, or accursed fiend below, Conspiring thy Troy's wrack and overthrow,— Alack, that happiness may not long last, That all these braveries been so brief a blast! Till one (I say) avenging power or other Buzz'd in the brain of the unhappy mother A dreadful dream, and as it did befall, To Priam's Troy a dream deadly and fatal. For when the time of mother's pain drew nigh, And now the load that in her womb did lie Began to stir, and move with proper strength, Ready to leave his place; behold at length She dreams and gives her lord to understand; That she should soon bring forth a fire-brand, Whose hot and climbing flame should grow so great That Neptune's Troy it would consume with heat. And, counsel taken of this troublous dream, The soothsayers said that not swift Simois' stream Might serve to quench that fierce devouring fire, That did this brand 'gainst town of Troy conspire. Which to prevent (a piteous tale to tell) Both sire and dame 'gainst law and kind rebel, And that this fear might so be overblown, This babe from Troy withouten ruth is thrown. But tempted may the Gods, not mocked be; It is thy fate, nor may thou, Troy, foresee What must befall, thou may'st it not foreknow: Yet Paris lives, and men him called so; He lives a shepherd's swain on Ida hills, And breathes a man 'gainst Troy and Troyans' wills, That threatens fire to Troy, a jolly swain. And here me list leave Priam and his train: And tend we Paris yet another while; How he can Nymphs and shepherds' trulls beguile, And pipen songs, and whet his wits on books, And wrap poor maids with sweet alluring looks; So couth he sing his lays among them all, And tune his pipe unto the water's fall, And wear his coat of gray and lusty green, That had the fair Œnone never seen His 'ticing curled hair, his front of ivory, The careless nymph had ne'er been so unhappy. Then was the time when Flora with her flowers, Like Iris in her pride and party colours, Sate in her summer arbours like a queen, And dight the earth in yellow, blue, and green, Then Phœbe 'gan a solemn hunting make, A feast for Pallas', Juno, Venus' sake; And on that Ida, where king Priam's son, Paris, this lovely shepherd's swain did won, A wondrous strife and variance did befall, Among the goddesses for a golden ball, That some fell fury threw among them all. And fatal was it to this shepherd's boy, That in his bosom bare the bane of Troy, To wander by that sacred place alone; Belike his Nymph and walking mate was gone: And there was chosen judge to end this strife, That after lost full many a man his life. And thus this doughty daysman, as I reed, Did crankly venture on this thankless deed: Whom Juno first, the great and stately Goddess, Entic'd with honour of much wealth and riches: And certes gold hath store of eloquence. Him Pallas eke the queen of sapience, Tempted with wisdom and with chivalry, To win the golden ball bequeath'd to beauty. But neither wealth nor wisdom might him move, When Venus 'gan t'encounter him with love. So led away with over-vain conceit, And surfeiting belike on pleasure's bait, As men are wont to let the better go And choose the worse, this jolly shepherd, lo! In hope to win the gallant flower of Greece, Fair Helena, that brave and peerless piece; Giveth the prize to lady Venus' grace, And ends with endless war this doubtful case. Ah Paris! hadst thou had but equal eyes, Indifferent in bestowing of the prize, Thy human wit might have discerned well, Wherein true beauty of the mind did dwell. But men must err, because that men they be, And men with love yblinded cannot see. Throughout the world the rumour being blown Of this event, the man was quickly known, And homewards comes forsooth to luckless Troy, Of yore a shepherd's swain, king Priam's boy: And in his breast did bear an uncouth heat, The strength whereof began to grow so great, As needs Sir Paris must prepare to see What might the substance of this shadow be, That yet his fancy wrought upon so fast. So furnished with men and ships at last To Lacedemon doth this minion come; The winds made way, the sea affording room: In fine, the cut and voyage being short, This knight arrives at Menelaus' Court, Where such his entertainment was I find, As justly might content a princely mind; For she was there to give him welcome tho, Who more his inward sense, than eye did know; A lusty, brave, and lively dame was she, A lass well worthy to be Paris fee; The queen herself that hight fair Helena, Whom yet unseen his thoughts did all obey: And by the hand she takes her new-come guest, And gives him entertainment of the best. Yet stately Troy did flourish in his pride, And Priam whom no prince might mate beside, Till love and hate together did conspire, To waste this town and realm with wasteful fire. The Prince of Troy 'gan easily now to see, How well her person with her fame did 'gree; When calling on Dame Venus for his due, The King of Sparta with a lordly crew, Must post from home and leave his wife forsooth, To give Sir Paris welcome for his tooth. Thus Venus first to help Love's policy, Advantag'd him with opportunity. And now as lovers wont their times espy, This lover can his task full well apply, And strives to court his mistress cunningly, Whose tender breast the conquering god of love, As will'd his dame, with arrows 'gan to prove, And found it fit for love's impression. No sooner was King Menelaus gone, But Helen's heart had ta'en so great a flame, As love increas'd with Paris' only name: And now she 'gan survey his lovely face, And curiously observe each courtly grace, And after large disputes of right and wrong, What did to love and woman-hood belong,— Ah, that this love will be no better rul'd, Ah, that these lovers nill be better school'd!— After sweet lines, that from this stranger's pen Came swiftly to her reading now and then, Regard of honour thrown aside by this, She arms her boldly to this great amiss; And, for her heart was from her body hent, To Troy this Helen with her lover went, Thinking, perdy, a part contrary kind, Her heart so raught, herself to stay behind. And thus hath Paris with his cunning caught The dainty bird that all so far he sought. No sooner were they started thus away, But straight the king, yet all too late a day, Had news of this unworthy traitorous deed, And after (says my story) 'gins to speed; But conquering love, that hath no leaden heels, Belike tied wings unto the Troyan's keels. Away flies Paris with his chased prey, And lands in Troy the gallant Helena, Whom aged Priam and Queen Hecuba, With all their noble sons and daughters too, Welcome with royal feasts and much ado; And every lovely dame and lusty knight, Do pay the prince such honour as they might. The peers, the princes, and the lords of Greece, Touch'd with the rape of this reproachful piece, Not suffering such barbarous villany, Dishonour to their state and country, In fury 'gan the quarrel undertake; Not all alone for Menelaus' sake, But to rebuke and to avenge beside Helen's false love, Paris' adulterous pride; Making provision for a lasting war, That wounded all so deep, and yet the scar Remains, and will endure from day to day, That teeth of fretting time shall never wear away. In Aulis' gulf they mightily assemble, Whose power might make the proudest Troy to tremble: Lord Agamemnon there among them all, With Greeks' consent was chosen general. Before this time a while, as I can reed, Ulysses, by the means of Palamede, Unhappy man, was fetch'd from Ithaca, Yet well could counterfeit a cause of stay, To tarry with his wife Penelope; But private cause must common cause obey, And though he feign'd a madness for the nonce, Yet can Sir Palamedes all at once To try his wit offer his tender son, Whom while the sire refus'd to over-run, That play'd the frantic ploughman all in vain, He roundly brought him to the Argive train: That for the hate he harbour'd in his head Nill cease till this Sir Palamede was dead. So Peleus' noble son, the great Achilles, That lothly with the Grecians went to seas, Clad by his dame in habit of a woman, Unworthy cowardice of a valiant man, But that no cowardice this deed can hight In him that was approv'd so good a knight, Ulysses with his toys and trifles trim Full like a pedler can decipher him. The force of Greece and armies all by this, For want of wind have hover'd long in Aulis: What mighty men misdo, the meaner rue; So great an ill by lingering doth ensue. Nor was there other help but Iphigen, That might enforce the winds to blow agen; And will he, nill he, Agamemnon must, If he will termed be a general just, Dispatch some trusty messenger or page, Under pretence of love or marriage, To fetch to Aulis' gulf the Argive queen, To see the spousals of fair Iphigen; And prince Achilles was her lover nam'd; But all untowardly this business fram'd: For Clytemnestra had espied ere long Whereto this subtle message did belong. In fine, the virgin slain in sacrifice, The Greeks have wind at will, the waters rise. How many ills do follow one annoy? Now merrily sail our gallant Greeks to Troy, And scour the seas, and cheerly run forth right, As shoots a streaming star in winter's night, Away they fly, their tackling teft and tight, Top and top-gallant in the bravest sort. And, as ye wot, this war and tragic sport It was for Helena. King Priam now 'gan easily understand How Greeks with all their power were hard at hand; And sadly do the peers their prince advise, The while in rage Cassandra calls and cries, Render, ye Troyans, to these madding Greeks The dame that all this expedition seeks. And to this battle, bruited far by fame, Great aid of arms on either party came: From Tyber, and the quaking Tanais, To Troy, the queen of Amazons by this, Penthesilea with her warlike band Arriv'd in honour of king Priam's land. And over long it were for me to tell In this afflicting war what hap befell; How many Greeks, how many Troyan knights, As chivalry by kind in love delights, Upon their helms their plumes can well advance, And twist their ladies' colours in their lance. So love doth make them bold and venturous: So hardy was the true knight Troilus, All for pure love of the unconstant Cressid, T'encounter with th'unworthy Diomed. But leave I here of Troilus to say, Whose passions for the ranging Cressida Require a volume to unfold at large, And cunning need he be that takes the charge, To paint the colours of that changing piece, Stain to all dames of Troy and stately Greece. And that I may do every man his right, Sir Paris mounted, in his armour bright, Pricks forth, and on his helm his mistress' sleeve; How could that sight but Menelaus grieve! And now the Greeks, and now the Troyans may, As pleaseth Fortune, bear away the day. The times of truce set down by martial law, The dames of Troy with lovely looks do draw The hearts of many Greeks, and lo, at last The great Achilles is enthralled fast! That night ne day he might his rest enjoy, So was his heart engaged whole to Troy: That now no more of arms this warrior would, Or, mought I say, no more for love he could; The camp complains upon his love and sloth, And charge him with his knighthood and his oath. Now rides out Hector, call'd the scourge of Greeks, And like the untam'd panther prys and seeks Where he might prove his force, and storming thus He lights upon Achilles' friend, Patroclus. Whenas the great Achilles 'gan him greet, And lion-like runs proudly him to meet, For rescue of his friend, as he were wood, And charging tight his staff in eager mood, Forgetful of the fair Polixena, As faulcon wonts to stoop upon her prey, As Hector had unhors'd Patroclus tho, Despoiling him in field, alas, for woe! Unwares to wreak this deed of his beleek, He slays a peerless Troyan for a Greek; And having thus perform'd this murderous treason, He triumphs in the spoils of Priam's son. Now 'gan the Grecians clap their hands for glee, But blood will blood, so ever mought it be. The Troyans' glory now 'gan waxen dim, And cold their hope, sith death hath seized him, That gave them hope and happy fortune too. The Mother Queen withouten more ado, 'Gan whet her wits to wreak this malice done, And traitorous murder of her valiant son. When Hector's death was more than half forgot, Or at the least dissembled well I wot, Full wisely 'gan this lady offer make, That if the Prince Achilles list to take Her daughter fair Polixena to spouse, In Pallas' temple should he make his vows: And thus the queen that knew no law of arms Vow'd clear to him and void of further harms. But when this Greek did little think of guile, To work revenge for Hector's death the while, Even in the fatal place Sir Paris than With poison'd shaft dispatch'd the hapless man; And where his mother Thetis him not hent, Directly thither was his arrow sent. Now lies the great Achilles dead in Troy; The Greeks make moan, the Troyans leap for joy, And Priam doth bestow his bloodless bones Upon his wretched heartless Myrmidons. Immediately began a bloody brawl Among the lords and Greekish captains all, Touching the armour of this valiant knight. Sir Ajax first doth claim it as his right, And then 'gainst him the Lord of Ithaca Thinks for desert to bear the prize away; And of the twain but one might it enjoy, And plead they must upon the strond of Troy Before the ships, where Ajax in a heat, For that the stomach of the man was great, Lays open to the Greeks his service done In their affairs since first this war begun, And twits Ulysses with his cowardice: But, Ajax, this for thee may not suffice; For though the targe were over big to bear, And stout Achilles' helm unfit to wear For wise Laertes' son, yet policy, That hight indeed the strength of chivalry, Was that whereof this knight doth chiefly vaunt; So with his words he 'gan their wits enchant, That, when he must conclude and say no more, 'A shows the fatal sign that to the shore 'A stole by night from Troy, and then (quoth he) Bestow it here, ye Greeks, if ye nill give it me. Wherewith he won their hearts, and charm'd their eyes, And from Six Ajax got the martial prize: The man, whom wrath and fury overcame, Not able to endure this open shame, Foully sought violent means to stint this strife, And with a deadly stab reav'd his own life. And now this wasteful war that lasted long, To dames of Troy and Greece a tedious wrong, With hot encounter and unhappy fight, And hasten'd death of many a hardy knight, 'Gan grow to this, that Greeks to blear the eyes Of their forwearied foes began devise: And having built a great unwieldy frame, Much like a horse, and well ystuft the same With men of war, they make a subtle show, As though from Troy they homeward meant to go, And raise the siege, and leave the prize behind, But gods do know they nothing less do mind: For, as I ween, my history doth say, To Tenedos the Grecians took their way, An isle that gave them harbour and abode: Now leave we there these Greeks to lie at road. Amidst this hurly burly and uproar, King Priam sends away young Polydore, With store of treasure, and with mickle muck, His youngest son to Thrace; but little luck Ensued this deed: for Polymnestor, lo, The thirst of Priam's riches chok'd him so! A woful tale as I have heard it told, Murders this prince for lucre of his gold. The subtle Sinon, for his villany The noted author of Troy's tragedy, When traitorous Greeks had slunk to Tenedos, 'Gan with the silly Troyans highly gloze, And tell a tale perdy of little truth, Although, as it befel, of mickle ruth: And so bewitch'd King Priam and his court, That now at last to Troyan's fatal hurt, Instead of that might most their states advance, They 'gree to hoise this engine of mischance, And make a breach like fools, and never lin Till their own hands had pull'd their enemies in: Thus riot, rape, and vain credulity Bin nam'd chief author's of Troy's tragedy. The monstrous horse, that in his hugy sides A traitorous throng of subtle Grecians hides, 'Gan now discharge his vast and hideous load, And silently disperse his strength abroad. It was the time when midnight's sleep and rest With quiet pause the town of Troy possess'd; The Greeks forsake the ships, and make return: Now Troy, as was foretold, began to burn, And Ilium's stately towers to smoke apace; The conquering Greeks begin amain to chase, And follow fast their foes, that unawares False Sinon had betrapped in his snares. Ah, what a piercing sight it was to see So brave a town as Troy was said to be, By quenchless fire laid level with the soil, The prince and people made the soldier's spoil! Th'unhappy Priam maz'd with frights and fears, Seeing his palace flame about his ears, Out of his wretched slumber hastily start, And weening to have play'd a young man's part, Girts to his arming sword with trembling hand; But she, alas! that bear the fatal brand That fir'd the town, the most unhappy queen, Whose like for wretched hap was never seen, Said, leave, my lord, becomes us not to strive, Whom would no morning sun might see alive! And fly from aid of men to powers divine, And so with me lay hold on Phœbus' shrine. But he, whose bloody mind and murdering rage Nor law of gods nor reverence of age Could temper from a deed so tyrannous, Achilles' son, the fierce unbridled Pyrrhus, His father's ghost belike enticing him, With slaughtering hand, with visage pale and dim, Hath hent this aged Priam by the hair, Like butcher bent to slay; and even there The man that liv'd so many golden years, The Lord and Master of such lordly peers, The King of Troy, the mighty King of Troy, With cruel iron this cursed Greekish boy Rids of his life, as whilom he had done With poison'd shaft Paris, old Priam's son. Thus souls by swarms do press to Pluto's hall; Thus, naked Troy, or now not Troy at all, Done is thy pride, dim is thy glorious gite, Dead is thy prince in this unhappy fight. My pen, forbear to write of Hecuba, That made the glorious Sun his chariot stay, And raining tears his golden face to hide, For ruth of that did afterwards betide: Sith this unhappy Queen surviv'd the last, Till fortune's spite and malice all was past, And worn with sorrow, wexen fell and mad: And all the happiness that Priam had In his mishaps and bloody funeral, Was that he saw not yet the end of all; His daughters ravish'd, slain in sacrifice, Astyanax before his mother's eyes, The princely babe thrown from the highest tower; Thus to our deaths there needeth but an hour. Short tale to make, when first the town of Troy The Greeks had sack'd, to Asia's great annoy, When Pyrrhus had the guilty Paris slain, Lo, now at last the Greeks have home again, With loss of many a Greek and Troyan's life, Unhappy Helen, Menelaus' Wife! The good Æneas, whom the gods beleek Reserv'd some further better hap to seek, With old Anchises leaves this wretched town, And on the seas ytossed up and down, Arrives in Lavine land, when he had seen The bounty of the famous Carthage Queen, Whom, driven by fates, this wandering knight deceiv'd, That him and his so royally receiv'd. My author says, to honour Helen's name, That through the world hath been belied by fame, How when the king her fere was absent thence, A tale that well may lessen her offence, Sir Paris took the town by arms and skill, And carried her to Troy against her will; Whom whether afterward she lov'd or no I cannot tell, but may imagine so. LINES ADDRESSED TO THOMAS WATSON Prefixed to the ???????????, or Passionate Centurie of Love. If graver heads shall count it overlight To treat of love, say thou to them, a stain Is incident unto the finest die: And yet no stain at all it is for thee, These lays of love, as mirth to melancholy, To follow fast thy sad Antigone, Which may bear out a broader work than this, Compil'd with judgment, order, and with art; And shrowd thee under shadow of his wings, Whose gentle heart, and head with learning fraight, Shall yield thee gracious favour and defence. THE PRAISE OF CHASTITY, WHEREIN IS SET FORTH, BY WAY OF COMPARISON, HOW GREAT IS THE CONQUEST OVER OUR AFFECTIONS. From the Phœnix Nest, 1593. The noble Romans whilom wonted were, For triumph of their conquer'd enemies, The wreaths of laurel and of palm to wear, In honour of their famous victories; And so, in robes of gold and purple dight, Like bodies shrin'd in seats of ivory, Their names renown'd for happiness in fight, They bear the guerdon of their chivalry. The valiant Greeks for sack of Priam's town, A work of manhood match'd with policy, Have fill'd the world with books of their renown, As much as erst the Roman empery. The Phrygian knights that in the house of fame Have shining arms of endless memory, By hot and fierce repulse did win the same, Though Helen's rape hurt Paris' progeny. Thus strength hath guerdon, by the world's award; So praise we birth, and high nobility: If then the mind and body reap reward, For nature's dower, conferred liberally, Press then for praise unto the highest room, That art the highest of the gifts of heaven, More beautiful by wisdom's sacred doom Than Sol himself amid the planets seven; Queen of content, and temperate desires, Choice nurse of health, thy name hight Chastity! A sovereign power to quench such climbing fires As choak the mind with smoke of infamy: Champion at arms, re'ncounter with thy foe, An enemy foul and fearful to behold; If then stout captains have been honour'd so, Their names in books of memory enroll'd, For puissant strength: ye Roman peers, retire, And, Greeks, give ground; more honour there is won With chaste rebukes to temper thy desire, Than glory gain'd the world to overrun; Than fierce Achilles got by Hector's spoil; Than erst the mighty prince of Macedon, King Philip's imp, that put his foes to foil And wish'd more worlds to hold him play than one. Believe me, to contend 'gainst armies royal, To tame wild panthers but by strength of hand, To praise the triumph, not so special, As ticing pleasure's charmes for to withstand. And, for me list compare with men of war, For honour of the field, I dare maintain, This victory exceedeth that as far As Phœbus' chariot Vulcan's forge doth stain. Both noble, and triumphant in their kinds, And matter worthy queen Remembrance' pen; But that that tangles both our thoughts and minds, To master that, is more than over men To make thy triumph: sith, to strength alone Of body it belongs, to bruise or wound; But raging thoughts to quell, or few or none, Save Virtue's imps, are able champions found; Or those whom Jove hath lov'd; or noble of birth: So strong Alcides, Jove's unconquer'd son, Did lift Achelous' body from the earth, To shew what deeds by Virtue's strength are done: So him he foil'd; and put to sudden flight, By aim of wit, the foul Stimphalides! And while we say, he master'd men by might, Behold in person of this Hercules, It liketh me to figure Chastity; His labour like that foul unclean desire, That under guide of tickling fantasy Would mar the mind through pleasure's scorching fire. And who hath seen a fair alluring face, A lusty girl, yclad in quaint array, Whose dainty hand makes music with her lace, And tempts thy thoughts, and steals thy sense away: Whose ticing hair, like nets of golden wire, Enchain thy heart; whose gait and voice divine Enflame thy blood, and kindle thy desire; Whose features wrap and dazzle human eyne: Who hath beheld fair Venus in her pride Of nakedness, all alabaster white, In ivory bed, strait laid by Mars his side, And hath not been enchanted with the sight; To wish to dally, and to offer game, To coy, to court, et cætera to do; (Forgive me, Chastness, if in terms of shame, To thy renown, I paint what longs thereto.) Who hath not liv'd, and yet hath seen, I say, That might offend chaste hearers to endure? Who hath been haled on to touch and play, And yet not stoopt to pleasure's wanton lure; Crown him with laurel for his victory, Clad him in purple, and in scarlet dye, Enroll his name in books of memory, Ne let the honour of his conquest die! More royal in his triumph, than the man Whom tigers drew in coach of burnish'd gold; In whom the Roman monarchy began, Whose works of worth no wit hath erst controll'd: Elysium be his walk, high heaven his shrine, His drink sweet nectar, and ambrosia The food that makes immortal and divine, Be his to taste, to make him live for aye! And that I may, in brief, describe his due, What lasting honour Virtue's guerdon is, So much and more his just desert pursue, Sith his desert awards it to be his. L'ENVOY. To thee, in honour of whose government Entitled is—this praise of Chastity, My gentle friend, these hasty lines are meant; So flowereth Virtue like the laurel-tree, Immortal green that every eye may see: And well was Daphne turn'd into the bay, Whose Chasteness triumphs, grows, and lives for aye! CORIDON AND MELAMPUS' SONG From England's Helicon, 1600. This song formed part of the Hunting of Cupid. Cor. Melampus, when will Love be void of fears? Mel. When Jealousy hath neither eyes nor ears. Cor. Melampus, when will Love be throughly shriev'd? Mel. When it is hard to speak, and not believ'd. Cor. Melampus, when is Love most mal-content? Mel. When lovers range, and bear their bows unbent. Cor. Melampus, tell me when Love takes least harm? Mel. When swains' sweet pipes are puft, and trulls are warm. Cor. Melampus, tell me when is Love best fed? Mel. When it has suckt the sweet that ease hath bred. Cor. Melampus, when is time in Love ill spent? Mel. When it earns meed and yet receives no rent. Cor. Melampus, when is time well spent in Love? Mel. When deeds win meed, and words love works do prove. THE HUNTING OF CUPID, BY GEORGE PEELE OF OXFORD, PASTORAL.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. ANGLORUM FERIÆ, ENGLAND'S HOLIDAYS. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE AND WORTHY LADY, KATHERINE, COUNTESS OF HUNTINGTON. Descend, ye sacred daughters of king Jove! Apollo, spread thy sparkling wings to mount, And try some lightsome sweet Castalian springs That warble to their silver-winding waves, Making soft music in their gentle glide! Clio, the sagest of these Sisters Nine, Conduct thy learnèd company to court, Eliza's court, Astræa's earthly heaven; There take survey of England's emperess, And in her praise tune your heroic songs! Write, write, you chronicle[r]s of time and fame That keep remembrance' golden register, And recommend to time's eternity Her honour's height and wonders of her age, Wonders of her that reason's reach transcend, Such wonders as have set the world at gaze! Write, write, you chronicle[r]s of time and fame, Elizabeth by miracles preserv'd From perils imminent and infinite! Clio, proclaim with golden trump and pen Her happy days, England's high holidays; O'er Europe's bounds take wing and make thy flight, Through melting air, from where the rising sun Gallops the zodiac in his fiery wain, Even to the brink where Thetis in her bower Of pumey and tralucent pebble-stones Receives the weary bridegroom of the sea, Beyond Grand Cair by Nilus' slimy bank, Over the wild and sandy Afric plains, Along the frozen shore of Tanais, Whose icy crust Apollo cannot thaw; Even there and round about this earthly ball Proclaim the day of England's happiness, The days of peace, the days of quietness, And let her gladsome birth-day be the first, Her day of birth beginning of our bliss; Set down the day in characters of gold, And mark it with a stone as white as milk, That cheerful sunny day! Wear eglantine, And wreaths of roses red and white put on In honour of that day, you lovely Nymphs, And pæans sing and sweet melodious songs; Along the chalky cliffs of Albion Lead England's lovely shepherds in a dance O'er hill and dale, and downs, and daisy-plots! And be that day England's high holiday; And holidays and high days be they all, High holidays, days, minutes, months, and hours, That multiply the number of her years; Years, that for us beget this golden age, Wherein we live in safety under her, Wherein she reigns in honour over us! So may she long and ever may she so, Untouch'd of traitorous hand or treacherous foe! Her birth-day being celebrated thus, Clio, record how she hath been preserv'd, Even in the gates of death and from her youth, To govern England in the ways of truth; Record heaven's goodness to this gracious Queen, Whose virtue's peer what age hath ever seen! To pass the story of her younger days, And stormy tempest happily o'erblown, Wherein by mercy and by miracle She was rescù'd for England's happiness, And comfort of the long-afflicted flock That stray'd like scatter'd sheep scar'd from the fold; To slip remembrance of those careful days, Days full of danger, happy days withal, Days of her preservation and defence; Behold the happiest day, the holiday That young and old and all done celebrate, The day of joy, the day of jollity! The best of all the days that we have seen Was wherein she was crownèd England's Queen, Elizabeth anointed of the Highest To sit upon her kingly father's seat, And wear in honour England's diadem, To sway that massy sceptre and that sword That aw'd the world in his triumphant hand, And now in her's commands the enemy, And with dishonour drives the daring foe Back to his den, tir'd with success[l]ess arms, Wearied with wars by land and wrack by sea. Muses and Graces, Gods and Goddesses, Adorn, adore, and celebrate this day! The meanest with the mightiest may in this Express his love; for loyalty alike Blazons affection's force in lord and lown. In honour of this happy day, behold How high and low, the young and old in years, England, hath put a face of gladness on, And court and country carol in her praise, And in her honour tune a thousand lays! With just return of this triumphant day, And prosperous revolution of the same, Auspiciously beginning many years And golden days and infinite to come, Passing in number and in happiness The best that ever earthly prince enjoy'd By sufferance of the highest King of kings; Behold, in honour of this holiday, What pæans loud triumphant London sings, What holy tunes and sacrifice of thanks England's metropolis as incense sends! And in the sound of cymbals, trumps, and shalms, In honour of his noble mistress' name, To whom his life he owes and offers up, Lo, London's Shepherd, guardian of his flock, Praiseth the Mighty One of Israel, And with the strings of his unfeignèd heart Tunes his true joy for all those days of peace, Those quiet days that Englishmen enjoy Under our Queen, fair Queen of Brute's New Troy! With whom in sympathy and sweet accord All loyal subjects join, and hearts and hands Lift up to Heaven's high throne, and sacrifice Of praises and of hearty prayers send; Thanksgiving for our blessings and the grace, The gracious blessings on that day pour'd down On England's head; that day whereon this Queen Inaugur'd was and holily install'd, Anointed of the highest King of kings, In her hereditary royal right Successively to sit enthronizèd. And in this general plaudit and applause, And celebration of this joyful day, Wherein pale Envy, vanquish'd long ago, Gave way to Virtue's great deserts in her, And wounded with remembrance of her name, Made hence amain to murmur that abroad He durst not openly disgorge at home, In his own nest fil'd with so foul a bird, And breathe his discontentments over sea Among those erring fugitives that pine At England's prosperous peace, and nothing more Do thirst than alteration of the state, And nothing less than our good Queen affect; A number of unnatural Englishmen, That curse the day so happy held of us, Whose base revolt from their allegiance due To prince and country makes them infamous, Condemn'd among the Turks and Infidels, False architects of those foul practices That end in their dishonour and their shame, Those bloody stratagems, those traitorous trains, And cruel siege they lay unto her life, Precious in sight of heaven and dear to us, Her loving and her loyal subjects all, Whom Jacob's God hath many ways preserv'd, Yea, even betwixt the bridge and water's brink, Saving her as by miracle in the fall From Pharoah's rod and from the sword of Saul: Lo, in this triumph that true subjects make, Envied of none but enemies of the truth, Her enemies, that serves the living Lord, And puts in him her confidence and trust, Thou sacred Muse of History describe, That all may see how well she is belov'd, What troop of loyal English knights in arms, Right richly mounted and appointed all, In shining arms accoutred for the war, Small number of a number numberless, Held justs in honour of her holiday, Ready to do their duties and devoir Against the mightiest enemy she hath, Under what clime soe'er his colours wave, And with keen sword and battle-ax in hand To wound his crest, whatever foe he be That any way in her dishonour braves! Among this stirring company of knights, That at the tilt in fair habiliments Gan shew themselves, renownèd Cumberland, Knight of the crown, in gilded armour dight, Mounted at Queen Elizabeth's approach, Inflam'd with honour's fire, and left his hold Kept by a dragon, laden with fair spoils: And there his duty done, and large device Made by his page known to her Majesty, Whose gracious eye reflecting on this earl Was like Prometheus' life-infusing fire, Behold, he stands impatient of delay, Awaiting there his friendly foe's approach: Daring he stands, true knight and challenger, And hardly brooks the time of their address That shortly came in duty all devote, To solace with their martial exercise Their princely mistress, to whose worthiness That day's device and days of all their lives Right humbly were and purely dedicate. The first that led, in cheerful colours clad, In innocent white and fair carnation, Was he whose wisdom in his younger years And love to arms make him so far renown'd, The noble Earl of Essex and of Ewe. His mute approach and action of his mutes Said that he was solicited diversely; One way to follow war and war's designs,— And well he may, for skill he can full well Of war's adventures, 'larms, and stratagems;— Another way t'apply him to the care Of commonweal affairs, and shew the way To help to underbear with grave advice The weighty beam whereon the state depends: Well may he this way or the other take, And both shall his nobility become; The gravity and greatness of the one Shall beautify the other's worthiness; His senate-robes shall beautify his arms, His chivalry nobilitate his name. Then Sussex, seated on his champing steed, Dreadful to see, and in sad tawny dight, Came in, as if some angry man of war Had charg'd his lance and put himself in arms, Under an eben tree or blasted yew: Such shew'd his plume, or like in my conceit To ravens' feathers by the moon's reflex, Shining where night by day doth take repose. Mars in his wrath sitting upon his drum, Devising tragedies, strikes no greater fear Into the eyes and hearts of earthly men, Than did methought this champion in his way; Nor in his doings ever man at arms So young of years more forward than this earl: So prone, so puissant, and successful still In all his courses was this warlike knight. Then Bedford and Southampton made up five, Five valiant English earls. Southampton ran, As Bevis of Southampton, that good knight, Had justed in the honour of the day; And certes Bevis was a mighty man, Valiant in arms, gentle and debonair; And such was young Wriothesley, that came As if in duty to his sovereign And honour's race for all that he had done, He would be of the noblest over-run. Like to himself and to his ancestors, Ran Bedford, to express his readiness, His love to arms, his loyalty to her Whose burning eyeballs did retain the heat That kindled honour's fire at their hearts; Bravely ran Bedford, and his staves he brake Right happily for his high mistress' sake. Compton of Compton came in shining arms, Well mounted and appointed for the field, A gallant lord; richly array'd was he, He and his train. Clio, recount his fame; Record with me his love to learning's lore, And valiant doings on this holiday! Short will I be in process of his praise; Courageously he ran, and with the best From forth the field bare honour o'er his crest. Carew was well acquainted with the place, And to the tilt proudly he made approach; His steed well taught, himself fitted in all, Fell to his noble exercise of arms, And on his courser gan himself advance, Whose neighs and plays were princely to behold: Remembrance of this day reviv'd this knight; His turn he takes, and at the trumpet's sound Breaks at the head with many a lofty bound. In bases and caparisons of cost Came three redoubted knights and men at arms, Old Knowles his offspring, gallant cavaliers; And such they shew'd as were King Arthur's knights He whilom us'd to feast at Camelot, Or three of great King Priam's valiant sons Had left Elysium and the fields of Mars To celebrate Eliza's holiday: They ran as if three Hectors had made way To meet Achilles, Ajax, Diomede. Palm had the eldest branching of his crest: 'Tis hard to say which brother did the best. Like Venus' son in Mars his armour clad, Beset with glorious globes and golden flames, Came Dudley in; nor shall it me become To dive into the depth of his device; Rich in his thoughts and valiant in his deeds, No whit dishonour'd by his fainting horse, That cowardlike would have held his master back From honour's goal,—ill-natur'd and ill-taught, To fail him foully in so great a presence. But as an archer with a bended bow The farther from the mark he draws his shaft, The farther flies it and with greater force Wounds earth and air; so did it fare in this: This lusty runner, thus restrain'd at first, Now all inflam'd, soon having chang'd his steed, And view'd the person of his princely mistress, Whose radiant beams have power to set on fire The icy ridge of snowy Rhodope, Flies like a bullet from a cannon's mouth. His armèd horse made dreadful harmony Grating against the rails: so valiantly He justed, that unjust it were in me Not to admire young Dudley's chivalry. Young Howard, ramping lion-like, came on, Anchor of Howard's honourable house, His noble father's hope, his mother's joy. Loyal and lovely was this fair young knight, Gracious in his beginnings at the tilt, Pleasing to her to whom he did present His person and the service of that day, And all the days and minutes of his life: Bravely he bare him in his mistress' eye, And breaks his staves and let[s] the shivers fly. Drury in flames of gold embroider'd fair, Inflam'd with love of virtue and of arms Came to the tilt like Phœbus, And like a warrior there demean'd himself; Heaven's vault, earth's centre sounded of his force: So well he ran as they that do him right, For field and court held him a worthy knight. Among these runners that in virtue's race Contended, rivals of each other's praise, Nowell and Needham, gentlemen of name, Came mounted and appointed gallantly; Both nobly-minded, and became them well, Resolv'd to run in honour of the day. L'ecu d'Amour, the arms of loyalty Lodg'd Skydmore in his heart; and on he came, And well and worthily demean'd himself In that day's service: short and plain to be, Nor lord nor knight more forward than was he. Then Ratcliffe, Reynolds, Blount, and Carey came, In all accoutrements fitting gentlemen; Well mounted and appointed every man; And gallantly and worthily they ran. Long may they run in honour of the day! Long may she live to do them honour's right, To grace their sports and them as she hath done, England's Astræa, Albion's shining sun! And may she shine in beauty fresh and sheen Hundreds of years our thrice-renownèd Queen! Write, Clio, write; write and record her story, Dear in heaven's eye, her court and country's glory!</field>
