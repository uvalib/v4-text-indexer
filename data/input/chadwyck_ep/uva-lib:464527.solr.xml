Her byginnet a tretys Þat is yclept Castel off Loue, Þat Bisschop Grostey?t made ywis For lewede mennes byhoue.

God Fader and Sone and Holigost, Þat alle þing on eorþe sixt and wost, Þat o God art and þrillihod, And þreo persones in onhod, Wiþouten ende and biginninge, To whom we ou?ten ouer alle þinge Worschupe him wiþ trewe loue, Þat kineworþe kyng art vs aboue, In whom, of whom, þorw whom beoþ [Alle] goodschipes þat we here iseoþ; He leue vs þenche and worchen so Þat he vs schylde from vre fo. Alle we habbeþ to help neode, Þat we ne beþ alle of one þeode, Ne iboren in one londe, Ne one speche vnderstonde; Ne mowe we alle Latin wite, Ne Ebreu ne Gru þat beþ iwrite, Ne French ne þis oþer spechen Þat me mihte in world sechen, To herie God, vre derworþe drihte, [Ac] vche mon ou?te wiþ al his mihte Loftsong syngen to God ?erne, Wiþ such speche as he con lerne. No monnes mouþ ne be idud, Ne his ledene [be] ihud, To seruen his God, þat him wrou?te And maade al þe world of nou?te. On Englisch ichul mi resun schowen, For him þat con not iknowen Nouþer French ne Latyn. On Englisch ichulle tellen him Wherfore þe world was iwrouht, Þeraftur how he was bitauht Adam, vre fader, to ben his, Wiþ al þe merþe of paradys, To wonen and welden to such ende, Til þat he scholde to heuene wende; And hou sone he hit forles, And seþþen hou hit forbouht wes Þorw þe hei?e kynges sone, Þat here on eorþe wolde come For his sustren þat were to-boren And for a prison þat was forloren; And hou he made, as ?e schul heeren, Þat heo icuste and sauht weren; And to w?uche a castel he alihte, Þo he wolde here for vs fihte. Þat þe Marie bodi wes Þat he alihte and his in ches. And tellen we schulen of Ysay, Þat vs tolde trewely: “A child þer is iboren to vs And a sone i?iuen vs, Whos nome schal inempned beon Wonderful, as me may iseon, And God, mihtful, and rihtwys, Of þe world þat [to] comen is Lord þe fader and Prince of Pes.” Alle þeos nomen hou he wes ?e schulen iheren and iwiten, And of domesday hou hit is iwriten; And of heuene we schulen telle, And sumdel of þe pynen of helle. Þauh hit on Englisch be dim and derk Ne nabbe no sauur bifore [a] clerk, For lewed men þat luitel connen On Englisch hit is þus bigonnen. Ac whose is witer and wys of wit And ?erne biholdeþ þis ilke writ And con þat muchel of luitel vnlouken And hony of þe harde ston souken, Alle poyntes he fynde may Of vre beleeue and Godes [fay] Þat bifalleþ to Godes godhede As wel as to his monhede. Offte ?e habbeþ iherd ar þis Hou þe world imaked is; For-þi ne kep I nou?t to telle Bote þat falleþ to my spelle. In sixe dayes and seue niht God hedde al þe world idiht, And þo al was derworþliche ido, Þe seueþe day he tok reste and ro. Lustneþ to me, lordynges, Þo God atte begynnynges Hedde imaad heuene wiþ ginne, And þe angeles so briht [and feir] wiþinne, And þe eorþe þerafter þerwiþ, And al þat euere in hire bilyþ, Lucifer in heuene wox so proud And he was anon icast out, And mo angeles þen eni tonge mai telle Fullen adoun wiþ him to helle. And ?it was þe sonne þo seue syþe iwis Brihtore forsoþe þen heo now is; Also schon þe mone aniht, So doþ þe sonne on dayliht. Ne holde ?e hit not for folye, For so seiþ þe prophete Ysaye. Alle þe schaftes þat þo weren More mi?t and strengþe beren Bifore þat Adam þe world forles. Allas! w?uch serwe and deol þer wes: Alle heo beoþ ibrouh[t] to grounde Þat of his ofspringe beoþ ifounde; Of heuene-blisse heo beoþ iflemed And to deolful deþ idemed. Þe reson is good and feir for-whi, As ichulle ow telle for-þi Þat ?e schule loue God þe more And him seruen and clepe to his ore. Þo Goþ hedde al þe world iwrou?t, Þat þer ne faylede ri?t nou?t, Beest ne fisch ne foul to fleon, And vche þing as hit ou?te to beon, Blosme on bou? and breer on rys, And alle þing betere þen hit nou is; And þo he hedde al wel idon, He com to þe valeye of Ebron. Þer he made Adam [alast] so riche Of eorþe after hymself iliche, And aftur [þe] holy þrillihod He schop his soule feir and good. How mi?te he him more loue schowen Þen his oune liknesse habben and owen? To paradys he ladde him þo, And caste sleep on him also Þat of his syde a rib he nom, And þerof Eue, his feere, com. He ?af Adam Eue to wyue To helpen; he ?af him wittes fyue To delen [þe] vuel from þe good; ?if he [him wel] vnderstood, He ?af him ?it more worschipe, Of al þe world þe lordschipe, And alle þe schaftes of water and lond Scholden ben vnder his hond, Feirlek and freodam and muche miht, And [al] þe world to delen and diht, And paradys to wonen in, Wiþouten wo and serwe and pyn, Wiþouten deþ in goode lyue, Þer ioye and blisse is so ryue, And euere to libben iliche ?ong, Oþat of hem to weren [at-sprong] Þe noumbre of þe soulen þat from heuene felle Þorw Lucifer adoun to helle. And whon hit forþ com al þe stren, So bri?t heo scholden iblessed ben So was þe sonne, as I er tolde, Brihtore þen heo now is seuen folde. And so heo scholden to heuene wende, To þe blisse wiþouten ende, Wiþouten drede of deþes dome. And al þe ofspring þat of hem come, From þat ilke day to þis, Scholde so stey?en to heuene-blis, To þe heritage of wynne and wele, Among þe murþe of aungeles fele. Two lawen Adam scholde iwis Witen and holden in paradis: Þat on him was þorw kynde ilet, Þat oþer was clept lawe iset. Þat on him tau?te atte leste Þorw kynde to holden Godes heste; Þat oþur lawe þat him was set: “Of þe appel þow neuer ne et, Of þe tre þat is forbode.” So [him] seide [and] hi?te Gode Þat whon he of þe appel ete, Þorw deþ he scholde þe lyf forlete, And al þe kynde þat of him com Scholde þole þulke dom; And ?if he heolde his heste riht, God [him ?af] so muche miht To welden al þis worldes winne, Wiþouten wo and serwe and sinne. Þe seisyn hedde Adam þo To wonen in blisse euere and o: In muche murþe and ioye he wes. Awei to sone he hit forles, His worschipe and his welfare, [And] brou?te vs alle in muche care. Þo he of þe appel eet, Godes heste he [forlet]; Þe kuyndeliche and þe set ek, Boþe his lawen he to-brek, And raþure he dude his wyues bode Þen he heold þe heste of Gode. Þus Adam þorw reuþful rage Was cast out of his heritage, And out of paradys idriue, In swynk and swot in world to liue. Þe blisse of lyf he haþ forsaken And to deolful deþ [him] itaken; Carfuliche he haþ icoren! Now he þorw ri?t haþ iloren Þe murþe þat he mi?te hauen. Whom mai he to helpe crauen? Out of his heritage he is pult For synne and for his owne gult. Lucifer gon wel lyke þo, Þo Adam was biswiken so, For alle þe fendes hedden onde Þat he scholde come to þat blisful londe Þat he hedde þorw pruide forlore; Wel hit likede hem þerfore. So muche wox heore miht þo Þat al þe world moste after hem go. And whon mon hedde iliued in care, Atte laste he moste dyen and forþfare; Ne mi?te him helpe no good dede Þat his soule moste to helle neede, For so hit was [to] Adam bispeke, And God nolde no forward breke. [Ful] eyle and hard and muche hit wes Þe synne þat þus þe world forles, Þat vche þing vnder heuene-driht So muche les of strengþe and miht. God ne wrouhte neuer þat þing Þat [mihte] les þorw his wonyng, For nis no wone on him ilong, ?if synne nere so hard and strong, For God ?af vche þing al his riht. Ac sunne wonede heore alre miht, For sunne and wone al is on. And wone dude Adam þo anon, Þo he Godes heste at-seet, And eke þo he þe appel eet. Þorw wone he lees his seysyne, Þorw wone he brouhte himself in pyne. In þe kynges court ?it vche day Me vseþ þulke selue lay. Now is Adam wiþ wo inome: Sunnes þral he is bicome, Þat freore was er þen eny þing Þat liuede vnder heuene-kyng. He is þorw riht [his] þeuwe and þral To whos seruise he vnderstod wiþal, Whon he him serwede in þe[u]dome And di?ede wiþouten fredome. And þeuwe and þral may not craue Þorw riht non heritage to haue: As sone as he is þral bicome, His heritage is him binome. In court ne in none londe Me ne ou?te onswere him ne vndurstonde. Þenne he mot anoþer seche, For to schewe for him his speche, Þat mowe his heritage craue And þat he þe kynde haue, Þat he beo iboren fre And þat he ne eete of þe tre, Þat he habbe iwust wiþ [wynne] Þe þreo lawen wiþouten synne: Þulke two of paradys And þulke of þe mount Synays, Þat to Moyses i?iuen was, Þat neuer ?ute iholde nas Of non þat euer dude sunne. Who mihte þenne such mon munne, Oþer þenchen or iknowe, Þat such wonder mihte schowe? Siggen I may in þis stude Þerof þat ich er dude, For nou [is tyme þat I hit telle], [For hit bihoueþ to vr spelle]. Hit was a kyng of muche miht, Of good wille and gret insiht, And þis kyng hedde a sone, Of such wit and of such wone, Of such strengþe and of such chere, As was his fader in his manere. Of on wille heo weoren bo, And of on studefastschipe also; Of on fulnesse heo weoren outriht, And boþe heo weoren of on miht. Þorw þe sone þe fader al begon Þat bilay to his kynedom: [What þat was of] his begynnynge Þe fader wolde to ende bringe. Foure douhtren hedde þe kyng, And to vchone sunderlyng He ?af a dole of his fulnesse, Of his miht and of his wysnesse, As wolde bifallen to vchon, And ?it was al þe folnesse on Þat to himself bilay, Wiþoute whom he ne mai His kindom wiþ pees wysen Ne wiþ rihte hit iustisen. Good is to nempnen hem for-þi: Þe furste dou?ter hette Merci— Þe kynges eldeste dou?ter heo is; Þat oþer hette Soþ iwis; Þe þridde soster is cleped Ri?t; Pees hette þe feorþe apli?t. Wiþouten þeos foure wiþ worschipe Mai no kyng lede gret lordschipe. Þis kyng, as þou herdest ar þis, Hedde a þral þat dude amis, Þat for his gult strong and gret Wiþ his lord was so ivet Þat, þorw besiht of riht dom, To strong prison was idon, And bitaken to alle his fon, Þat sore him pyneden euerichon, Þat of no þing heo nedden onde Bote him to habben vnder honde. Heo him duden in prisun of deþ And pyneden him sore wiþouten meþ. Merci þat anon isei?. Hit eode hire herte swiþe neih, Ne mai hire no þing lengore holde, Byforen þe kyng comen heo wolde To schewen forþ hire resoun And to dilyuere þe prisoun. “Vnderstond,” quaþ heo, “fader myn! Þow wost þat I am dou?ter þyn, And am ful of boxumnes, Of milce and of swetnes, And al ich habbe, fader, of þe. I [be]seche þat þou here me, Þat þe [sorful] wrecche prisoun Mote come to sum raunsum, Þat amidden alle his fon In strong prison hast idon. Heo him made agulte, þulke vnwreste, And biswikede him þorw heor feir beheste, And seiden ?if he wolde þe appel ete, Þat whon he hedde al iete, Of þe treo þat him was forbode, He scholde habbe al þe miht of Gode; And begile[de] him þerof and luytel rou?ten, For falshede euer ?ite heo souhten. And falshede hem i?olde be, And þe wrecche prisun isold to me! For þow art kyng of boxumnes, Of milce and of swetnes, And I þi douhter alre eldest, Ouer alle þe oþere beldest. Neuere I þi douhter neore Bote milce toward him were. Milce and merci he schal haue, Þorw milce ichulle þe prisun craue; For þin owne swete pite I schal him bringe to sauete.

And wolde þis þral of prisun bringe, Þat Riht hedde idemet wiþouten endinge, Al heo chaunged hire mood, And biforen þe kyng heo stood: “Fader, I þe biseche, herkne to me!

Þou art also so trewe a kyng And stable of þou?t in alle þyng; For-þi me þinkeþ Merci wilneþ wou? And spekeþ to?eynes Ri?t inou?, For Riht con hym in prison bynde, He ou?te neuere milce to fynde. Milce and merci he haþ forloren, He was warned þerof biforen. Whi scholde me helpe þulke mon Þat nedde of himself pite non? His dom he mot habbe, as Soþ con sugge, And al his misdede abugge.” Riht iherde þis talkyng, Anon heo stod bifore þe kyng. “Þi dou?tur,” heo seiþ, “I am I wot bi þon, For þou art kyng, riht domesmon: [Þe] beþ rihte domes mitte, [And] alle þine werkes beþ ful of witte. Þis þral of whom my sustren mene Haþ [doom] deseruet as at ene, For in tyme while þat he freo wes, He hedde wiþ him boþe Merci and Pees, And Soþ and Riht he hedde bo, And wiþ his wille he wente hem fro And tyed hym to wraþþe and wou?, To wreccheddam and serwe inou?. So þat ?if riht geþ, He schal euere þolyen deþ: For þo þow him þe heste hi?test, Þorw Soþ [þo] him þe deþ [þou] di?test, And I myself him ?af þe dom, As sone as he hedde þe gult idon, For Soþ bereþ witnesse þerto, And elles nedde I no dom ido. ?if he in court biforen vs were, Þe dom þou scholdest sone ihere, For Riht ne spareþ for to iugge Whatsoeuere Soþ wol sugge. Þorw wisdam heo demeþ alle, As wole to his gult bifalle.” Soþ and Riht lo þus heo suggeþ, And þis þral to deþe iuggeþ. Neuer nouþer ne spekeþ him good, Ne non þat Merci vnderstood. Ac as a mon misirad, On vche half he is misbilad; Ne helpeþ him no þing wher so he wende, Þat his fo [him fetteþ] in vche ende And istrupt him al start naked, Of mi?t and strengþe al bare imaked. Him and al þat of him sprong He dude a þeuwedam vyl and strong And made agult[en] swiþe ilome, And Riht com after wiþ hire dome. Wiþouten Merci and Pees heo con iugge, Euer aftur þat Soþ wol sugge. Ne Pees mot not mid hem be, Out of londe heo mot fle, For Pees bileueþ in no londe Wher [þat] is werre, nuþ, and onde, Ne Merci mot not among hem liue, Ac boþe heo beþ of londe idriue. Nis þer nout in world bileued Þat nis destrued and to-dreued, And dreynt, forloren, and fordemed, But ei?te soulen, þat weren i?emed In þe schup, and þat weoren heo, Noe and his sones þreo, And heore wyues þat heo hedden bifore; Of al þe world nas beleued more. Careful herte him ou?te come Þat þencheþ vppon þe dredful dome, And al hit is þorw Riht and Soþ, Þat wiþouten Pees and Merci doþ. So þat Pees alast vpbreek And þus to hire fader speek: “I am þi dou?ter sau?t and some, And of þi fulnesse am I come. Tofore þe my playnt I make: Mi two sustren me habbeþ forsake; Wiþouten me heo doþ heore dom, Ne Merci among hem nou?t ne com. For no þing þat I mi?te do Ne moste Merci hem come to, Ne for none kunnes fey Ne moste ich hem come ney?, Ak þat dom is al heore owen. For-þi ich am of londe iflowen And wole wiþ þe lede my lyf, Euer [o]þat ilke stryf Þat among my sustren is awake Þorw sauhtnesse mowe sum ende take. Ac what is hit euer þe bet Þat Riht and Soþ ben iset Bote heo [witen] wel [þe nome Pees]? Rihtes mester hit is and wes In vche dom pees to maken. Schal I þenne beo forsaken, Whon [eueri] good [for me] is wrouht, And to habben me biþouht? [Ak] he ne louede [me] neuere to fere Þat Merci, my suster, nul not here. Off vs foure, fader, ichul telle þe Hou me þinkeþ hit ou?te to be. Whon þe foure beþ togedere isent To don an euene iuggement, And schul þorw skil alle and some ?iuen and demen euene dome, Þer ne ou?te no dom forþ gon, Er þen þe foure ben at on. At on heo moten at-stonden alle And loken seþþen hou dom wol falle. Be vs foure þis I telle, We beoþ not alle of on spelle; Boþe ich and Merci, We beclepeþ þe dom for-þi; Hit is al as Ri?t and Soþ wol deme, Merci ne me nis hit not qweme. Wiþouten vs þer is bale to breme, For-þi, fader, þow nime ?eme! Of vche goodschipe Pees is ende, Ne fayleþ no weole þer heo wol lende; Ne wisdam nis not worþ an hawe Þer Pees fayleþ to felawe, And hose Pees loueþ wiþouten gabbe, Pees wiþouten ende he schal habbe. Mi word ou?te ben of good reles, For þou art kyng and prince of pes; For-þi þou ou?test to here me And Merci, my suster, þat clepeþ to þe, Þat þe þral, þe prisoun, Mote come to sum raunsoun. Vre wille, fader, þou do sone, And here vre rihte bone, For Merci euere clepeþ to þe Til þat þe prison dilyuered be, And ichul fleon and neuere come [Oþat] my sustren ben sau?t and some.” Þe kynges sone al þis con heren Hou his sustren hem to-beeren, And sei? þis strif so strong awaken And Pees and Merci al forsaken, Þat wiþouten help of his wisdome [Heo mihten] neuere togedere come. “Leoue fader,” quaþ he, “ich am þi sone, Of þi wit and of þi wone, And þi wisdam [me] clepeþ me. And so muche þou [louest] me Þat al þe world for me þou wrou?test, And so þou me in [þy] werke [brou?test], For we beoþ on in one fulnesse, In miht, in strengþe, and in hei?nesse; Ichulle al don þat þi wille is, For þou art kyng rihtwis. So muche, fader, ich nyme ?eme Of þis strif, þat is so breme, Þat for þe tale þat Merci tolde þe Ful sore þe prisun reweþ me. For-þi he reweþ me wel þe more For Merci euere clepeþ þin ore. Þou art, fader, so milsful kyng; Hire we schul heren of alle þing. [Al hire wille ichulle] done And sauhten Soþ and hire ful sone. Nimen ichulle þe þralles weden, As Soþ and Riht hit wolden and beoden, And al one ichul holde þe doom, As Iustice ouhte to don, And maken ichule Pees to londe come, And Pees and Riht cussen and be sau?t and some, And druyuen out werre, nuþ, and onde, And sauen al þe folk in londe.” Hose þis forbysene con, He may openliche iseo bi þon Þat al þis ilke tokenynge Is Godes insiht almihti kynge: Wiþ[oute] God þe Fader nis maked nouht, Þorw God þe Sone is al þing wrouht, And alle þing is folfuld outriht Þorw God þe Holigostes miht; And alle þreo beþ on, þouh hit be so, In one fulnesse and in no mo. He ?iueþ his blessynge wiþ mouþ and honde To alle þat þis writ vnderstonde. ?e habbeþ iherd as ich ow tolde, For-whi God þe world maken wolde And hou Adam forles þorw synne World and heuene and al monkynne, Þat for mi?t ne strengþe ne for no þing No mon nedde of himself a couryng, Ne angel mi?te mon helpe on none wyse, Ne mon mi?te himself fro deþe aryse. Þenne moste nede beo þorw vche doom Þat God of heuene mon bicom, Mon þe deþ þolen þorw serwen ryue And God vprysen from deþ to lyue, [For] elles were alle forlore to nouht Þat God hedde in þe world ibrouht. Herkeneþ [whuche] loue and boxumnesse, Whuch milce and eke swetnesse, Þat God from heuene alihte chees For [on sele shepe] þat he lees! [Þe ninti nine he leuede] and eode To sechen on in vncouþ þeode. Þenne nis þer such herdemon non, Ne non so [milsful] lord as he is on. Whose wolde his herte on such lord holde Þat so muche loue him kuiþe wolde Þat lyk himself wolde him make And siþen deþ þolyen for his sake; Er him ou?te þe herte to-springe Þen he scholde him wraþþe for eny þinge. Herkeneþ now forþure atte frome How vr Saueor wolde come. To Abraham þe tiþinges comen, Þe prophetes hit vndernomen, Þat is, Moyses and Ionas, Abacuk and Helyas, Daniel and Ieremye, Dauid and Ysaye, And Eliseu and Samuel Siggeþ Godes comynge wel. [Long] hit were hem alle to telle, Ac herkeneþ hou Ysaye con spelle: “A child þer is iboren to vs And a sone i?euen vs, Þat schal vpholden his kynedome, And al þus schal ben his nome: Wondurful God and of miht, And redeful and fader ariht Of al þe world þat heraftur schal ben, Prince of pees me schal him sen.” Þeos beþ þe nomen, as ?e mowe leeuen, Þat þe prophetes him ?eeuen. ?if ?e wolen heren, tellen ichulle How þat child is wonderfolle. Such wonder nas neuer iherd in sawe Ne neuer schal bi none dawe For no tyme þat euer schal come, As God of heuene mon bicome. For hose now ise?e heere A child þat riht ilimed nere, Þat þreo feet and þreo honden beere, And anoþer, þat oþerweis weere, Þat hedde foot or hond forlore, And heo weore boþe so ibore, Weoren heo wonderfol þeose two? Nay, forsoþe neoren heo no, For þe on hedde kuynde ouermeþ, And þat oþer to luyte, and so hit geþ, Ac hit is as hit mot nede ben, Of vnmete kuynde a forschipte streon. Ak þat mihte muche wonder ben, ?if me mi?te eny iseon Þat monnes kuynde hedde al ariht, Þat him neore to luite ne to muche wiht, So þat he were al soþfast mon, Þat no forschippyng weore him on, And eke were good hors wiþalle! Such þing may neuer bifalle, For hose se?e a such gederyng, He mihte hit clepe a wonder þing. And ?it is more wonder a þousend folde Of þe child þat Ysay?e of tolde And clepede him wonderful for þon Þat he is soþ God and soþ mon, For of monhede ne wonteþ him nouht, And þorw him is al þing iwrouht, And wiþouten [synne he is] euere, For wone dude he neuere, Ne no schaft þorw him mi?te lees, As biforen irad wes. Oþur God nis þen he þat heuene dihte Þat from heuene [to erþe] alihte And vnder vre wede vre kynde nom And al soþfast mon bicom. And whon he wolde alles bicome mon, He moste be boren of a wommon, Þulke schaft to vnderfonge wiþalle Þat ou?te to monnes kynde bifalle. God nolde alihte in none manere But in feir stude and in clere. In feir stude and clene siker hit wes Þer God almihti his in ches: In a castel wel comeliche, Muche and [fere] and loueliche, Þat is þe castel of alle flour, Of solas and of socour. In þe mere he stont bitwene two, Ne haþ he ferlak for no fo, For þe tour is so wel wiþouten, So depe idiched al abouten Þat none kunnes asaylyng Ne may him deruen for no þing. He stont on hei? roche and sound, And is iplaned into þe ground, Þat þer ne mai wone non vuel þing Ne derue no gynnes castyng. And þau? he be so loueliche, He is so dredful and hateliche To alle þulke þat ben his fon, Þat heo flen him euerichon. Fo[u]r smale toures [þer] beþ abouten, To witen þe hei?e tour wiþouten. Seþþe beoþ þre bayles wiþalle, So feir idiht wiþ strong walle, As heo beoþ hereafter iwrite. Ne may no mon þe feirschipe iwite, Ne no tonge ne may hit telle, Ne þou?t þenche ne mouþ spelle. On trusti roche heo stondeþ faste And wiþ depe diches beþ bicaste. And þe carnels so stondeþ vpriht, Wel iplaned and feir idiht. Seue berbicans þer beoþ iwrouht, Wiþ gret ginne al biþouht, And euerichon haþ ?at and tour; Þer neuer ne fayleþ socour. Neuer schal fo him stonde wiþ Þat þider wol flen to sechen griþ. Þis castel is siker and feir abouten, And is al depeynted wiþouten Wiþ þreo heowes þat wel beþ sene. So is þe foundement al grene Þat to þe roche faste liþ; Wel is þat þer murþe isihþ, For þe greneschipe lasteþ euere, And his heuh ne leoseþ neuere. Seþþen [aboue] þat oþer heu? So is inde and eke bleu, Þat þe middel heu? we clepeþ ariht, And schyneþ so feire and so bri?t. Þe þridde heu? an ouemast Ouerwri?eþ al and so is icast Þat wiþinnen and wiþouten Þe castel lihteþ al abouten, And is raddore þen euere eny rose schal, Þat þuncheþ as hit barnde al. Wiþinne þe castel is whit schinynge, [As] þe snow? þat is sneuwynge, And casteþ þat li?t so wyde, Afterlong þe tour and besyde, Þat neuer comeþ þer wo ne wou?, Ac swetnesse þer is euere inou?. Amidde þe hei?e tour is springynge A welle þat euere is eornynge, Wiþ foure stremes, þat strikeþ wel And erneþ vppon þe grauel And fulleþ þe diches aboute þe wal. Muche blisse þer is oueral: Ne dar he seche non oþer leche Þat mai riht of þis water cleche. In þulke derworþe feire tour Þer stont a trone wiþ muche honour, Of whit iuori and feirore of liht Þen þe someres-day whon heo is briht, Wiþ cumpas iþrowen and wiþ gin al ido; Seuene steppes þer beoþ þerto, Þat so feire wiþ ordre iti?ed beoþ. Feiror þing in world no mon seoþ, For heuene-bouwe is abouten ibent, Wiþ alle þe hewes þat him beþ isent. Neuere so feir chay?ere Nedde kyng ne emperere. Muche more feirschupe inou? þer wes Þer God Almi?ten his in ches. Þenne nis þer such castel non, Ne neuer nas but þulke on, Ne neuer eft after be ne schal, For God of heuene hit dihte al And wrou?te hit himself and al dude, To alihten in þulke feyre stude From his kindam aboue. He cudde þe stude muche loue! Þis is þe castel of loue and lisse, Of solace, of socour, of ioye and blisse, Of hope, of hele, of sikernesse, And ful of alle swetnesse. Þis is þe Mayden[es bodi] so freo; [Þer] neuer nas non bote heo Þat wiþ so fele þewes iwarned wes, So þat swete Mayden Marie wes. Heo stont in þe mere bitwene two; Heo schilde vs alle from vre fo Þat vs awayteþ day and niht; Heo vs helpeþ wiþ al hire miht. Þe roche þat is so trewe and trusti, Þat is þe Maydenes herte for-þi Þat neuer synne þer wiþinne com, Ac heo to seruen God al hire nom And wuste hire wiþ muche boxumnesse, Hire maidenhod wiþ swetnesse. Þe foundement þat faste to þe roche li?þ And þe feire greneschipe þerwiþ, [Þat is] þe Maydenes bileeue so riht Þat haþ al hire bodi iliht, For hire bileeue þat is so trewe, Þat euere is grene and euere newe, For bileeue is apertement Of alle vertues foundement. Of þe middel heu? is to wite Þe swetnesse and þe feirschipe. Þat is þe bitokenyng: In goode hope as so ?ong þing Was so bisy in swetnesse To seruen God in boxumnesse. Þe þridde heu? on ouemast, Þat haþ ouer al his liht icast, And as þau? hit barnde al hit is— Nis non of so muche pris— Þat is þe clere loue and briht Þat heo is al wiþ iliht, And itent wiþ þe fuir of loue, To serue God þat is hire aboue. Þe foure smale toures abouten Þat [witeþ] þe hei?e tour wiþouten, Foure hed þewes þat aboute hire iseoþ, Foure vertues cardinals [þat] beoþ, Þat is, strengþe and sleihschupe, Rihtfulnesse and w[a]rschupe. Euerichon [haþ] a ?at wiþ ginne, Þat may non vuel come þerinne. And whuche beoþ [þe] þreo bayles ?et Þat wiþ þe carnels beþ so wel iset And icast wiþ cumpas and walled abouten, Þat witeþ þe hei?e tour wiþouten? [B]ote þe inemaste bayle, I wot, Bitokneþ hire holy maidenhod, Þat neuer for no þing iworsed nas, So ful of Godes grace heo was. Þe middel bayle, þat wite ?e, Bitokneþ hire holy chastite. And seþþen þe ou[t]emaste bayle Bitokneþ hire holy sposayle. Riht me clepeþ hem bayles for-þi Þat heo habbeþ þis ladi in here bayli, Þat hireself, one makeles, Is mayden chast and weddet wes. Þorw on of þeos bayles he mot teon Þat wol on ende iborwed beon. [And] þe seue [berbicans] abouten, Þat wiþ gret gin beon iwrou?t wiþouten And witeþ þis castel so wel, Wiþ arwe and wiþ qwarel, Þat beþ þe seuen vertues wiþ winne To ouercome þe seuen dedly sinne; Þat is, pruide, þe biginnynge And þe roote of al vuel þinge, [Þat] al maat and ouercomen wes Þorw boxumnes þat heo ches; And hire trewe loue ouercom envye, And hire abstinence glotonye; And lecherye heo made fle [Þorw] hire holy chastite; And [al] was distruyed couetyse Þorw hire largesse in vche wyse; And [euere] wraþþe heo ouercom Þorw [pacience] þat heo nom; And hire gostliche gladynge Destruyed sleuþe þorw alle þinge. Þe welle springeþ of alle grace Þat fulleþ þe diches in vche a place. Godes grace to-deleþ þis, Þorw meth wiþ al as his wille is, Ac he louede so þis mayden apli?t Þe folle of grace he hire ?af outriht, Þorw whom þe grace þat ouerfleot Socoureþ al þe world ?ut. For-þi me may hire riht clepe and calle O blessed ouer oþere alle. And what mowe þe diches be But hire þolemode pouerte; [Þer was] nones kunnes assaylyng [Þat mi?t derue þe castel] for no þing, Þorw whom þe fend is ouercomen And his miht al bynomen. For þis is þe ladi so gent and fre Þat God seide of to þe neddre on þe tre Þat þer scholde comen a wommon [blyue] Þat scholde al his [hed] to-dryue. Iblessed be þis buyrde of prys Þat ouer al oþure iblessed is, Þat so feir was and good so sone Þat of hir [soule] God made his trone To his owne gistenynge, And nom flesch and blod of hire to bringe His folk out of prisoun; Þat was vre garysoun. Þis ladi is feir and good and fre, Whon heo haþ so muche bounte, More þen eny schaft þat wes; For-þi [þe sonne of rihtwysnesse] hire ches And schadewede on hire in wolde And feirede hir more a þousend folde. Þo[r]u? þe faste ?at he con in-teo, At þe out?ong he lette [hit] faste be. How so þat was beo we stille, For of alle þing God may don his wille. A, derworþe qween, so gent and fre, Þat helpeþ alle þat fleoþ to þe! Mi soule is comen to þe for nede, Þat at þi ?ate bat and loude doþ grede, Bat and gredeþ and loude gon crye: “[Help me], swete Mayden Marie! Vndo, ladi, I þe biseche! Þou lete me a luitel cleche Of þulke [grace] þat alle frouere Þat gostliche beoþ in herte pouere. Lo hou I am biset heeroute, Wiþ my þreo fon al aboute: Þe fend, þat wiþ me fihteþ euere, Þe world, my flesch, heo ne stunteþ neuere. Wiþoute eny meþ on me heo foþ, Swiþe gret harm heo me doþ.

Gret wraþþe heo habbeþ to me inome, I am as campion ouercome. But þou me helpe, Mayde Marie, Ichabbe ilore þe maystrie! [Þou þat art to all febull leche, Þou let me of þy diches cleche] Þer þe castel is faste and stable And charite is constable.” Of þis castel ichabbe a luitel told, Ac more me mi?te a þousend fold, For alle þe godschupes þat in þe world is Out of þis castel icomen is. Þorw þis laddre God heuene-[drihte] From heuene in to eorþe alihte, And nom of hire his monhede, Þorw whom he wrey his godhede. Þis is þe ?ard þat [bar] þe flour, Þat maiden þat bar hire creatour. And þus þe child is iboren to vs And such a sone i?eue to vs. And nis he wonderful þerfore Whon he is þus for vs ibore? So muche wonder nis of no þinge As two kuynden togeder bringe, And þat eiþer kuynde wiþalle Habbe þat wole to heom bifalle, Þat neuer nouþer ne wonte no wiht, Ac þat eiþer habbe al his riht. Þat is Jhesu, Godes sone, Þat from heuene to eorþe wolde come To sau?ten his sustren þat were to-boren, And dilyueren þe prison þat was forloren. Two kuynden he haþ we witen bi þon Þat he is soþ God and soþ mon. Bihold now, mon, to Godes miht And his deden hou heo beoþ [i]diht, Þat þou aboute nou?t fer se, Ac bihold hou boxum he wolde be Þat he wolde be boren of wommon And for vre sake bicomen mon. And seþþen behold hou he vs redeþ And into sauete vs ledeþ On ful swete manere and on non oþur, And seiþ þus to vs: “Leue broþur, I seo þe mislyken and al for?emed And out of þin owne lond iflemed, And þou seost wel þat for no þing Þow hast of þiself no keueryng.

Ac þe gost of charite and of þolemodnesse Loueþ euer goodschipe and boxumnesse, For whon to þe world him ?eueþ þe mon And þe worldes good him waxeþ on, He ne þenkeþ on God ne non oþer þynge Bote worldes catel togeder bringe; And whon þe catel haþ þe maystrie alast, Hit is in his cofre biloke so fast Þat al he bicomeþ ouergart proud And misdoþ his nei?ebors boþe stille and loud; No þing ne wilneþ he largesse But lordschupe and hei?nesse. Þe forbysne of boxumnesse iwys Al þorw pruyde for?eten is. Þeose ne mowen Jhesus suwen wiþ, For heore dede al to-lyth, Ne his red ne leeueþ heo nou?t. Whi þenne wolden heo wilnen ou?t Of heritage in his kyndom, Þau? he in batayle þe ple biwon, Whon heo doþ al þat he forbat And no þing doþ of þat he hat, Ac euer secheþ pride and hei?nesse Ne biddeþ heo nou?t of boxumnesse? For-þi Lucifer, as ?e habbeþ herd telle, Fel from heuene adoun to helle, And also I drede heo scholden an ende, Þulke þat suche werkes doþ, aftur him wende, Ac I ne sigge hit not for þon Þat mai ful wel eueriche goode mon Habbe gret lordschupe and hei?nesse, Castels and [tounes] and gret richesse, And may [wel don] and Godes wille holde And libbe God to queme wel, ?if he wolde, ?if he lyueþ in [loue] and in boxumnesse, In soþschupe and in rihtwysnes, For God wilneþ no þing on eorþe her But al monnes herte wiþ trewe loue and cler. Nou mihte sum mon asken þus: Hou wolde God plede for vs [And] hou he eny batayle nom And won vre ri?te and a fend ouercom? Lustneþ þenne to me nou, And ichulle ow tellen hou. Þo Jhesu, Godes sone, in þe world was ibore, So stille and derne he was þe fend fore Þat he of his come riht nou?t nuste, [Ac] to beo lord and syre he truste, As he hedde ben, ac his miht was binome Þo þat Jhesu was ibore and into þe world icome. Wel þe fend him sei? in monnes weeden, Ac he nust what he was ne w?uch weren his deden. He [sei? him] wel mon and icomen of monkunne, Ac euere in þe world he liuede wiþoute sinne. Þe fend wondrede swiþe and seide. “What artou? Wher þou be Godes sone þat [icomen art] nou? Al þis world ichul ?euen þe [?if] þou bouwe and honoure me.” Þo seide Jhesu: “Go awei, Sathan, go!

Nay, for þat foreward þorw Soþ and Riht Faste in Godes court is congraffet apliht Þat hose passede Godes heste He scholde [euere] be myn and in sunne leste, An ende dyen þorw hard deþ inouh, And þe kyng of heuene nul do no wouh. What wenestou such foreward breke Þat was in Godes court ispeke?” And þo swete Jhesu him onswerde and tolde: “Þat foreward on ende god wel was iholde, Ac þou hit bigonne formast to breke, Þo þou þorw treson to monkuynde speke And seidest þat treo him was forbode, Lest he hedde þe miht of Gode, Ac wolde he of þe appel ete, Þenne þou seidest he hedde igete, He scholde konnen al þat God con And he scholde neuer die for þon. He agulte þorw þe and elles he wer skere. Vnderstond my reson, ?if hit skile were, [Þat] þou heddest alle forward of me And þou noldest holden hem as anont þe.” “A, ich am bitray?ed!” quod þe fend þo. “Nou ich am þorw ple ouercomen so. Of whom and hou comeþ hit, Such reson and such hit, Þat þou so baldeliche darst nymen þe Forte dispute a?eynes me? Þorw ple ichabbe iloren al anon, [Ac] so ne may hit nou?t gon: Algate he haþ misdon, Þorw whom he is in my prison, And bote he beo forbou?t of me, [I] ne ou?te from wo disseysed be.” Þo swete Jhesu to him con sugge: “And ichulle him þenne forbugge.” “?if þou wolt him bugge to his feore, He schal costen þe ful deore.” “Hou deore?” quaþ Jhesu þo. “As he is worþ er þenne he go Out of bonde of my prison.” “Þat is skile,” quaþ Jhesu, “and good reson. Ne kep I nou?t to?eynes riht, Þorw maystrie binyme þe no wiht.” “No, ac er he dilyuered be, Þou most also muche [worþ] delyuere me As al þis world is nou [worþ] atte frome, Wiþ alle þulke þat schulen heraftur come.” “Bleþeliche,” quod Jhesus, “al ichul don þis, For my luttel fynger more worþ is Þen such an hondred worldes ben, Wiþ al þat folk þat me may herafter sen.” Þe fend þo to Jhesu onswere con: “Þat is al soþ, I seo bi þon, For þou mai?t al þe world demen and dihte: For nou ouer þe nabbe I no mihte. And woldestou þi fynger ?eue, þau? þou so sugge, So vnworþ and so vyl chaffare to bugge?” “?e,” [quod Jhesus,] “and al my bodi for his raunsoun, But ichul him habbe out of prisoun.” “Þou most more do ar þou [habbe him] so, Þolen on eorþe wandreþe and wo. And ?if þou wole amenden his wou?, Þou most deþ þolen þorw strong pyne inou?.” And þo swete Jhesu him onswerde [to]: “Al þat þou hast seid, al schal be do, For Soþ seide hit ou?te ben so, And Riht com after [and ?ef] þe dom þo. And more þen þou hast iseid ichulle don To diliuere þe þral out of prison.” Þo was þe fend siker and wende wel eþe Forte haue bi?eten þorw his deþe, Ac he was cau?t and ouercomen, As fisch þat is wiþ hok inomen, Þat whon þe worm he swoleweþ alast, He is bi þe hok iti?ed fast. A, mon, nim ?eme and vnderstond þe Hou fynliche in herte God loueþ þe, Þat wolde deþ þolen þorw pyne wiþouten meþ To saue þi soule from pyne of deþ! Al vre gult on him he wolde take, And lodliche was bilad al for vre sake, For he þat neuer no sunne dude Ne neuer nas wiþ fulþe ifounden in no stude In alle þe lymes þat haþ þe mon, Seþþen Adam formest sunne bigon, Wolde þat his lymes all ipyned were To maken vs of sunne al quit and skere. For vre vnwrestschupe here Þe coroune of þornes on his hed he beere, And for vre [fol e?e] also His e?en weore blyntwharuet bo, And al was his face bifoulet wiþ spot, And eke grete boffetes me him smot; And for vre speche vnwreste and vyl Atter heo him dude to drinke wiþ eisil; [For] þe otewyse werkes as þere a[b]onden He lette boþe þurlen his feet and honden, And for vre woke þou?tes he þolede smerte Þat me his syde þurlede to þe herte. What miht he þenne do for vs more? No tonge may tellen of þat [s]ore, Ne no monnes herte ne mihte þenche so, As he þolede for vs pyne and wo. And ho is þat ne mi?te habbe pite Of such frendschupe and charite? Suche beo þe duntes of batayle Þat he þolede for vs wiþouten fayle; Ac he þolede to deþe ben ibrou?t: Vre deþ þorw his deþ he haþ forbou?t, For more [he þolede] an hundret folde Serwe and pyne þo he dyen wolde Þen þe fend mihte for eny synne Leggen hond vppon monkunne. For þe soule loueþ þe bodi so Þat neuere heo nule him wende fro, For no pyne ne for [no] sore, Þau? me hit to-hewe euer more, Er þe fyf wittes ben loren outriht, Al heore vertue and al heore mi?t: Þat is, þe siht and þe herynge, Þe speche and þe smellynge, And þe felynge he schal leosen an ende, Ar he wole from þe bodi wende. Kuynde ne may for no þinge Þolen her þe [to-delynge], Ac he þat alle þing mai welde Doublede his peyne an hondred felde, For þo he [honged] on þe crois, He ?af his soule wiþ loud vois. Þer he schewede þat he was God so: Vre raunsum he dude þo. Þe bodi ?it liuede wiþoute fayle, And so he ouercom þe batayle. Kuynde ne mihte þole such peyne non, For þe fend ne mi?te hit neuer legen on. [A,] Marie, Mayden schene, Mihtful moder and milde qwene, For deol mungen I ne may Þe pyne þat þou þoledest þulke day, Ac þe prophecye of Symeon Was folfuld þo bi þon, As wiþ swerd in þulke stounde [Þorw þe soule] þou heddest ful bitter wounde. Ac þi ioye doublede an hondrut folde, Þo he from deþ vprysen wolde, For nou?t worþ weore his passion, Neore his resurexion. Þou se?e openliche in alle þinge Of his batayle þe endynge, Þorw whom þe fend was al mat And þe world forbou?t and brou?t in stat. Þe trouþe of vs and þe beleeue also [Forsoþe] bileuede al in þe þo. In wonhope weore his disciples vchon, Ac þou weore studefast euer in on, Ne mi?te þe no þing tornen out, In trewe bileue euere þou weore stille and loud. Marie, mooder of pite, Mayden ful of alle bounte, Vre bileeue was þo in þe iwis, And nou al vre hope is Þat þou biseche þi sone for vs, Þat so on rode forbou?t vs. ?e habbeþ iherd of swete Jhesu Hou he þorw his muchel vertu Vs redeþ to goode euer more, And hou he wolde vs plede fore, And hou he wolde to batayle wende, And hou he hit ouercom an ende. Nas þis a good redesmon Þa[t] vs so deore forbuggen con And haþ irud vs þe way Þer vchone of vs þat wole he may To þe blisful ioye come, Þat so longe þorw Adam was binome? Vnderstondeþ nou forþure noþeles, Hou he is God and euere wes, And ?e mouwe openliche iseon Þat hit ne may not elles ben. O God al þe world wrou?te And þulke God vs alle forbou?te; Oþer God nis non þen he, Þe God of whom I seide er þe: Persones þreo in þrillehod And o God cleped in onhod. Men may also, clerkes þat conne reden, Iseon his godhede þorw his deden, For al þe deden þat he dude here Wiþ godhede and monhede imeynt [were] ifere. And nym nou ?eme and þou miht sen Hou þat ilke mihte ben. Hose hedde a swerd here Þat wel isteled and kene were, And he hit into þe fuir dude Þat hit were brennynge in þe stude, Ho is þat þenne mihte, Whon hit barnde so brihte, Þe fuyr to-delen þe stel fro, Oþer þe stel from þe fuir mo? And hose wiþ þe swerd smite, Two kuynden he mi?te sen and wite: Þe stel þorw kuynde kerueþ apliht, And þe fuir [brenneþ], and þat is riht, And al of o swerd hit come. Also is of Jhesu, Godes sone: Two kuynden he haþ we witten þi þon Þat he is soþ God and soþ mon. For atte neces of [his] priutee, At þe Caane of Galylee, A gistnynge he made Architriclyn, Þer he torned water to wyn. Sixe vessels þer weoren idon, Of water he bad hem fulle son. [As mon] he bad don water þerin And as God he turned hit to wyn, And þis ilke dede was al on, Of soþfast God and soþfast mon. And elles wher þer he eode Muche folk him suwede of feole þeode, Þat fyf þousend men he haþ [fed] [Wiþ tweie fisches and fiue loues of bred], And of þe relef þat hem leuede bifore Twelf cupeful weoren vp ibore. As mon he hem þe bred to-brek And as God he haþ hem ifulled ek. Of Lazar also þou miht iseon eþe, Hou he him arerede from þe deþe, Þat foure dawes he lei? along In þe buriles, þat he stonk. Wiþ loud voys he clepede þus: “Lazar, arys and cum out to vs.” Riht as mon he clepede him to And as God he arerede him [so]. In alle his deden me may wel isen Þat he is God and euer schal ben. Þulke God alle þing dihte, Þat in þe swete Mayden alihte. Al vre beleeue in him is, Vre treuþe and vre hope iwis, Persones þreo in þrillihod And o God þau? in onhod. Nou ?e habbeþ iherd witterly Hou he is God almihti, Ac his strengþe ne may non telle, Herte þenke ne mouþ spelle, For þe hei?e nome Jhesu Haþ in him so muche vertu Þat al þat is in heuene hi?e, In eorþe and bineoþen, feor and nei?e, Bouweþ to þilke nome vchon. For-þi þer ne may hit telle non, His miht and his strengþe hou hit geþ. But as a mon þe rynde fleþ, Sumwhat touchen ichulle fonde Of þat ich may vnderstonde. Þo Adam hedde iloren þorw synne Heuene and eorþe and paradyses winne, Þe fend hedde such miht þo Þat al þe world moste after him go. For [whom] þe world was furst wrou?t He haþ him vnderibrou?t. Such strengþe he him þo ches Þat prince of al þe world he wes. Þer nas non for his goodschupe, For penaunce, ne for holyschupe, Þau? he pynede himself in flesch and felle, Þat þe fend ne ladde him to helle. [Ac] þe strengþe of Jhesu, Godes sone, Hym haþ al mated and ouercome. Ouercomen and imat he was ful sone, Þo he wende of him to done, As he hedde don of oþer alle Þat he lette into helle falle. Alle he ladde after his wille And into helle [con] hem spille. To þe croys[, as Cryst honged,] he con come And wolde habben his soule inome, Ac he faylede, þe traytour. He was abated of his tour, For Godes godhede him haþ doun cast Into helle and ibounden fast; For þorw his godhede his soule eode Þidere for hise þat hedden neode, Þat ?ore hedden him abide And sore longeden to gon him mide. Helle-?ates he al to-breek And to-daschte al þe fendes ek. A gret bite he bot of helle [anon] And drouh alle hise out vchon Þat leeueden his [come] and him knewe And serueden him wiþ herte trewe. Such strengþe nas neuer iherd ar þis, Ne neuer schal but of him iwis, For þe meste strengþe he al bireuede Þat þe fend in þe world heuede. [Þe fend] was armed ful stronge, Þat his ?at wuste ful longe, Ac þo þe strengore him ouercom, Gret preye he him binom. For-þi him seiþ wel Ysaye, Þat seiþ in his prophecye Þat he scholde [mihtfol] icleped ben. His strengþe may no mon iseon, Ne no tonge ne mihte reden Ne [herte] þenken his mihtful deden. For his miht me ou?te him drede And for his swetnes him loue ful nede. Þis is vre [s]child and vre help, Vre strengþe and vre ?elp, Vre beleue and vre socour, Vre treuþe and vre honour, Þat so boxum bicom for vs, He ?af himself to sauen vs. And al o God dude þis, Fader and Sone and Holigost iwis. Sumdel ?e habbeþ iherd nou riht Of his strengþe and of his miht, Ac herkneþ ?it forþure of Ysaye, Þat cleped him in his prophecie Fader of þe world þat scholde come, For while he walkede her atte frome, He folfulde in alle þinge Alle holye prophetes [biddynge]. Hou he is fader, ?e schullen iheren, And hou we alle of him istreoned weren. Þorw Adam we sungeden furst vchon And eeten þe appel wiþ him anon, And alle [þat] of him istreoned weoren, Þe cors þat he beer alle beeren; Þorw kuynde [heo] hedden þe curs alle, Þorw riht ne mi?t hit elles bifalle. Adam, vr fader, þe forme mon, Fleschliche streoned vs euerichon, Ac þulke flesc[h]liche streonynge Beere vs bale and serwynge, Neore þe grace of swete Jhesu, Þat vs strenede [þorw] gostliche vertu. Þorw Adam we weore to deþe idemet, Þorw Jhesu vprered and al iquemed. He is vre fader ariht, And so goodliche vs haþ idiht Þat wiþ his blod he vs [waschede] of sinne And [forbou?t] vs out of wo to winne. Neuer fader for no childe Of fyn loue nas so freo ne mylde, [For] from þe roode for vre neode Riht into helle he eode. Fourti tymen þer he wes [O]þat he vprisen ches. Þat was on þe þridde day, Erliche vppon a sonenday, Þo þe ni?t fro þe day to-brek. So seide Seynt Austin þo he spek. Wiþ him he drou? out alle hise Þat di?eden in his seruise, From þe tyme þat he Adam wrou?te [O]þat he vpros and vs forbou?te. To his disciples he him schewede ilome, And eet and dronk, eode and come. Fourti dawes he was heere fulliche And prechede hem Godes kineriche, [Oþþon] holy þoresday, þer on his nome, Heo weren igedered alle isome Vppon a stude, þer he among hem com, And of misbileue hem vndernom. In whonhope and doute heo weoren vchon, ?it heo se?en him [aryse] a lyuesmon. Þo ?it ne mihten heo for no wit Riht to soþe ileeuen hit, Ac heore doute was vre biheue And fastnede ful wel vre bileeue, For muche vs dude sikernesse Of Thomas misbileuenesse, Þat nolde for no mon þat was Bileeuen þat he arisen was, Ar he hedde hondlet þe wounde so wyde Þat Longeus made in his syde, And seon þe woundes grene and weet W?uche þat weoren on honden and feet. Þo schewed Jhesus him his wondes wyde, In hondes and feet and þulke on his syde. “Þou art, ichot,” quaþ Thomas þo, “Mi God and my Lord also.” “?e, Thomas,” quaþ Jhesu Crist, “Þou hit leuest for þou hit sixt. Alle heo moten iblessed ben Þat hit leeuen [and doþ] hit not sen.” Openliche he made þulke day Faste and siker vre [f]ay. Wiþ his disciples he eet þo, As he was er iwont to do, And sette tweyne and tweyne to gon, ?ond al þe world to prechen vchon, To alle schaft and to alle wihte, Þat is, to mon þorw rihte, Þat heo bileeuen in Godes sone, þat is in him, And þat vche mon folwede him, In þe Fader [nome and þe] Sone also And in þe Holygost[es], þat glit of hem bo. For hose neore iboren eft at þe frome, Into heuene ne mi?te he neuer come, Ac þulke þat beþ ifulwed in riht bileeue Schulen beo brou?t in Godes biheue. Wel openliche he scheweþ vs þerfore Þat vche mon mot eft ben ibore, And ?if we schulen eft iboren ben, We mote comen of [sume] streon. Þat is þe water of vertu Þer vs gostliche streneþ swete Jhesu, And whon he vs haþ so strened iwis, Forsoþe vre fader [þenne] he is And þenne we alle his children beþ. Sikerliche vnwrestliche he deeþ Þat such fader ne loueþ wiþ al his þou?t. He ne eet of þe appel riht nou?t: Baldeliche we mouwe þorw him craue Vre rihtes in heuene to haue, For he haþ alle þe lawen iwust, Of o poynt ne haþ he mist, Þat neuere neore iwust ne iholde, Er he himself comen wolde. Þe forme mon, þat of eorþe com, Brou?t vs werre and pees binom; Þat oþur from heuene com wiþ meyn And haþ i?olden vre pees a?eyn. Fleschliche was þe forme mon, Þat muche wo vs brou?te vppon, Þat was out of paradys ipult, And al his ofspring for his gult, Ac vre gostlych fader, swete Jhesu, Vs bryngeþ a?eyn þorw his vertu. He þat from heuene com, From louh an hei? he vs vpnom. Þat from eorþe com, to eorþe he geþ; Þat from heuene com, to heuene he steþ. On holy þoresday þer al þe folk isei? W?uche þat stoden abouten him neih; Þe wey he made vs to lede, Þorw þe skewes þer he eode, Wiþ soþnesse and wey [and lif]. [His] feire cumpanye him ladde wiþ Þat he out of helle nom, Þat to muche blisse com. To þulke blisse he made hem wende Þat euer lasteþ wiþouten ende, Þer he woneþ as he dude er, Wiþ his fader, o God þer, Persones þreo in þrillihod And o God þau? in onhod, Þat alle þing wrou?te, as þou, mon, wost, Fader and Sone and Holygost. Þau? vche nome of þise þre [Be] sinderliche, as he ou?te to be, O God hit is wiþouten care, Of alle schaftes schuppare, To whom ioye and honour bicome, Wiþouten ende þe holy gome. Lusteneþ ?et forþer of Ysayes spelle, For now ?e han herd me telle, How swete Jhesu our fadur wes; Herkenyth how is now prince of pes. Beforen I tolde ?ow vchon How he is into heuyn igon; Ry?ht so, þe sothe truly to syggen, He shall a?eyn come þis world to iuggen, In bodi and soule and godhede, To deme bothe queke and dede. But fyftene dayes before þe dome Fyftene tokyns ther shull come. The furst day þe see vpryse shall And stonden on hye as a wall, Fourti cupetys heir iwys Then eny hill in þe world is. That oþer day heo wole isonkyn byn, That eny mon vnneþe may her isyn. The þrid day heo woll be noþeles As full as heo furst wes, And þen woll whalles and grete fysshes wiþ fynne And all oþer smale fysshes þat byn þerinne Gedryn hem on þe watur vchone. But þat wot no mon but God allone What is the betokenyng Of the loude cry and ?eiyng The[t] heo wolleþ wiþ loude steuyn ?euyn and crye vp to heuyn. And on þe fourthe day heo shall Wiþ red fyr brennen all, And all oþer watrys in euery stede Shullen brenne as red as eny glede. The fyfthe day þe tren þat don stonde And floures and erbis in vche londe, Blod thei shullen blede, In stede of her dewe wiþoute drede. The sixte day byth not bold, Palyse ne pyler ne so strong hold, Castell, tour, bour, ne halle, But þei shull to-skatur and down falle. The seuynth day the stones vchon Woll lepe togedre and fy?ht anon, That þorwgh the fy?ht þat þer woll byn The stones woll breke and all to-flyn. The ey?hte day betokynþ gret wrache: All ?ende þe world þe erthe shall quake, And men woll flyn into vche hurne. The erthe-quake shall be so loude and sturne, And on þylke dredfull byttur day The pepull woll crye weloway And sey to monteynes: ”Falleþ on vs! Erthe to-clyf and hyde vs, That we þis fer and erthe-quake ne syn.” How wroth our creatur woll byn, For in alle hye heuyn-blys Non so holi ne so good is, Patryarch, apostell, ne martir, Confessor ne virgine wiþ so feyr attyr, Prynce, potestate, ne angell, Ne non so bry?ht archangell, That nold neuer synne done But he shall dredyn a?eyne þat dome. Full sor mowe heo þen dreden That byth all full of synfull deden. The nynthe day alle þe valeis þat byth And the hylles þat we so hye syth Shull be made smethe and playn, And into her kynde shull þey not turne a?eyn. The tenþe day shull all maner men Gon out of her holes and of her den And renne abowte as þey wer wod, As þey cowþen nowþer euyll ne good, Ne thawgh her hert shulde to-breke, On word my?ht not oon wiþ oþer speke. The elevyth day þe mone and þe sterres alle Shulle adown to erthe falle. The twelfthe day þe bones of vche ded mon Shull come togedre vchon, Thawgh þey be dryuyn ner so wyde; At her [byryles] her soules shull abyde. The threttenyth day all maner men Shull dyen anoon þat lyuen þen, That heo mowe togedre wiþ oþer aryse And takyn her dome of God ry?htwyse. The fourteneth day ther may no þyng werne But all þe world on fyre shall berne; Heuyn and erthe shull byn aleyde, And the four elements shull vnteyede, For thike fyr shall clansyn þe eyr And makyn all þyng bry?ht and feyr, And all þe world shan iclansed byn, But watur þer shall no mon eft isyn, Ne neuer fyr in þe world me syth When þat fyr shall ben aquenchith. The fyfteneþe day God wol taken Heuyn and erthe and all hit newe maken, Not oþerweys þen hem beforen wrowght. Loke þou, þenke, ne wylle hit nowght, But he wole newen hem iwys In betur state þen heo weryn iwys. Theraftur Jhesu wole his dome demyn, The angeles shull come and blowe þe bemyn. Furst shull in body and soule aryse All þat dyedyn in his seruise, And all þat eke þat shull to þe blysse fonde Shul furst aryse and on þe ry?ht syde stonde. Then shall Jhesu come ry?ht [þus] And his body tornen and showe to vs Whad peyne he suffred for vr sake And how lodlyche he was for vs itake, Wyth scorges ibetyn wiþoute gryth, That þe blode barst oute on ich a lyth, And how vylensli he wes ladde ?et Wiþ crowne of þornes on his hed set, And how he suffred þat þe nayles stode Thorgh fete and honden into þe rode, And how þe sper þat him wonded smerte Browght blod and watur from his hert. And þen Cryst woll clepe and calle And sey: ”Þus myche I suffre[d] for ?ow alle.” Then helpeþ [þe] no pledyng þer, Ne forsakyng ny answer, Ne helpyth vs þe castell ne tour, Nowþer palyse, halle, ne bour: All þyng þen shall torne to nowght That is wiþ monis hond iwrowght. Ther shull þe synfull quake And her tethe togedur hacke and shake. Ther may segge þenne no mon But þat vchon shull seyn her martyrdom, And beforyn hym his iuggement sycorly Shall byn iwryten apertely, And allso his synnes ther shull be knowe, Tofor all maner men boþe hie and lowe. Then woll swete Jhesu to hem be syn That shull þat day isaued byn, And sey wiþ mylde steuyn and swete: “When I was hongry, ?e ?eue me mete; When I was afurst, ?e ?eue me dryng; When I was naked, ?e ?eue me cloþyng; When I was herberlasse, ?e herberde me sayne, Boþe in heete, in cold, in wynde, and rayne; And ?e comforted me in prison eke And loked to me when I was seke. Comyth, my blessed children vchon, And receyuyth þe blysfull ioy anon That to ?ow byth rewarded wiþoutyn endenge Fro þis worldis begynnyng.” Then shull þe blessed byn receyued an hy?he, In heuyn to walke Jhesu ny?h. And þe cursede shull in erthe byn, Of heuyn blys þey shull no þyng isyn, But ?et wyth þe vpreceyueng þey shull agryse, When þe saued shull vpryse, So wery, so wrecched, so lodlyche, Icharged wiþ synne so heuyleche, That all heuyli on þe erthe þey shull steke, When þei heryn þe domesmonis speke Wyth gret and grymfull wrathe full sone. Thei shull heryn a full hard dome: “Goth wiþ þe deuelys, ?e acoursed bestes, For ?e heled not my lawes and my hestes, Into þe fir þat shall last for euer, For ?e han diserued her non oþer!” The blessed shull blysfull gon In bodi and soule euerichon, As bry?ht as ys the sonne wiþoute fayle. Neuer hem nedeþ to haue trauayle But ioy and blys þat shall laste euer mor. In good tyme [þey] wer ibor That to þat feste mowe takyn, That God wole wiþ hem in heuyn makyn. So myche ioy shall byn at þeke feste That euer wiþouten ende shall leste, Mor ioy þen hert may thenkyn Or eye isyn or ?er iherkyn; Seche ioy God haþ igrethed ther To hem þat han loued him her. And when [hit is] so endeles, Thenne he is ary?ht prince of pes. But theke þat byth into helle inome, Thei shull neuer out come, And in þeke stynkyng deþe-pytte Thei shull byn ipyned and to peyne iknytte. In gret sorewe and pyne þei byth full sor, For thei lyuyn in wanhope euer more. Thei wolde dyen ?ef thei my?hte, But ?et her soule may not þorgh ry?hte. Vchon oþers peyne shall isyn, That her peyne shall dowble byn. Anoþer peyne þey shull haue of derknes, Wiþ gret fer and gret heuynes. And þe four is fyr þat may not be queynte, And in stynkynge watur þey shull be dreynte, And pycche wallyng euer among. Wayleway euer shall byn her song, For hidor or thidur wher ser heo turne They syn þe foule fynde in vche horne. That hem lothest wer to syn He shall euer toforyn hem byn. And þe stenche is ouerall þer so strong, And byttur wormys ther stykeþ among, Neddris, snakys, and taddis þer strykyth; No place shall he þer isyn þat him lyketh. Euermor wiþoutyn ende þey shull be wepyng And wrynge her hondes wiþ gret weylyng. Then shall þe syster sey to þe broþer, The fremed and þe sybbe vchon to oþer: “A, waryed wrecche, whad doost þou her? Acursed be the tyme þou iboryn wer; I may not for no þyng suffre the, So foule þy synne stynkeþ on me. For [min owne] gret synne I styke in pyne, But a thousonde fold more I suffre for þyne. But þou waryed wrecche forlore, Accursed be the tyme þat þou wer ibore! I am sor [stykyd] among, Thi synne stynkeþ on me so strong.” Thus shall vchon to oþer menyn his sorewe, Euer wiþowtyn ende on euyn and morewe; Thawgh þer sete a mon for the nonys And he my?ht leftyn in flesshe and bonys, Half þe sorewe he my?ht not telle Ne þe peynes þat byth in helle. Ther is nowþer solace ne loue iwys; Ther is wepyng, pyne, and sorewe wiþoute blys. In theke foule stynkyng pytte They shull in sorowe for euer be knytte. Long is “euer” and long is “oo,” But þei shull neuer come out of wo. The fynde shall her prince byn þat þey serued er; Sore wiþowten ende peyned þey shull be þer. Jhesu in heuyn, as I seyde before, Is pryns of pes and shall byn euer mor. His pes shall falle neuer, And his ioy and his blys þat is euer. Loue, swetnesse, and pley, In heuyn hit neweþ fro day to day. The furst ioy þat þer shall byn, The blessed shall hit isyn The swete face of his lorde þer, His God and his shaper. In his feyreship he may him showen, And all þyng in him may knowen. So full he shall byn of ioy and skyle That he shall haue all þat he wyle; Whatseuer he wylneþ wiþouten gabbe, Bese on him, and he may it habbe. Of heuyn he may ise þe wydnes, The feyrshepe and þe heynes, And he may ise þe dereworth quene, Goddis modur so bry?ht and shene, The swete made Seynt Marye, And all þe feyr company Of angels so feyr and bry?ht. They woll makyn him ioye wiþ her my?ht; The apostlys and þe martiris, The confessors and þe virginis, Alle wolle him ioy makyn— Well is him þat þidur may takyn!

Iblessed be þe tyme þat þou ibore wer, So myche ioy I haue þat I se þe her. So myche blys I see on the That all my blisse neweþ me.” Thet oþer answereth him anonry?ht: “Euer iblessed be God allmy?ht, That seche ioy haþ i?eue to þe, Therfore my ioy doubleþ me; On þe I se mychell ioy and blys That all my ioy newed is. And euer her is myrthe and gret song, And euer I se our shaper among, That ilike himseluyn vs haþ wrowght And sethyn to þis ioy vs browght.

Here begynnes a romance of Englische of the begynnyng of the world and of al that a lewed man has nede for to knawe for hele of soule. This romance turned Munk of Sallay out of a Frenche romance that Sir Robert, Bisschop a[t] Ly[n]coln, made; and eked mekel therto as him thoght spedeful to edificacion and swettenes of deuocion and lering of lewed men. And her is no thing sayd bot as haly writ says and grete doctours, and therfor thou that redys this and any comfort has therinne, pray God be way of charite to haue mercy on him that turned it in this maner. And if thou couayt to loue God and to plese him, take Mirrour and loke oft therinne. Whoso wele thinkes, wele may say, For of gode thoghtes comes gode dedes ay. God send vs thoght to his plesyng, In whos fre wil hynges all thyng. He is God and Lord of my?tes mast, The Fader and Sone and Haligast; In godhed are thise persones thre, And all are on God in trinite; None is othir of thise persons thre, Bot alle are on God and ay sal be. Our mede is to trowe this with stable thoght, Al be hit that mannes skil proues it noght, Bot when we sal se God clerly, Than sal we knawe this witerly. Of the begynnyng of the world God in vj dayes made bothe erthe and heuen, And, to make haliday, cessed at the seuen. Heuen was occupid with angeles kynde, Euermore on God for to haue thair mynde, Bot many thorgh pride fel into helle, Thar sal thei all withouten ende dwelle. Bothe sunne and mone [more] bri?t thai ware Then seuen fold then thay now are, And all erthli thing more vertuous, Bifor Adam thurgh synne was vicious. And ilk a best sul[d] haue bowed to mannes will, Had he neuer bi way of synne don none ill. When God had the world so parfit made That no partie of hit defaut hade, Then of erth he made Adam of man-age, To his liknes in saule he was and his ymage. Of a rib of Adam syde, when he lay slepand, God made Eue, that sho to him suld ay be kepand; Of on God made al mankynde, for ilkon suld loue other, And non til other do wrong mor then til his brother. What lyf my?t mor be schewed to man in charite Then in saule make him lik to the haly trinite, Make him lord of al the world, ful of vertue?, and wise, Make him eir of heuen-blis, and sette him in paradis, Thar he and all that come of him my?t leue withouten deyng, If thay vse the frut of lif and kepe wel Godes biddyng? Of all the trees of paradis bi Goddis biddyng thei suld ete, But the frut of the tre of wetyng of gode and ille thei suld lete: What tyme as thei ete of that thai suld forfet thair heritage And be oblischid to deth and helle-payne, thai and all thair lynage; Bot if thai had kepid wel all Goddis biddyng, Thai suld haue leued ioyfully, and all thair ofspring, Til thai had ben tan til heuen to fille that fair place That thurgh pride of Lucifer and his feres voyde was. Thar thai suld haue had mor ioye than hert may thenk or tunge telle, And neuer non of thair kynd suld haue suffride payn of helle. Of the losyng of the world thurgh synne When Adam and Eue sesyn hade in the blis of paradys, The fende—for he hade that ioye lost—enuy had to thair delice. Then he come in neddir liknesse to Eue with a wommans face And sayde: “Whi bad God ?e suld no?t ete of all trees that ther was?” “Of all the trees,” quod Eue, “that thar is, we may ete at our liking, Out-tan on that is forbod paraunter for dred of deyng.” Than sayde the fend: “?e sall no?t deye therfore, God wot it wele, Bot as God sall ?e be, knawand bothe gode and yuell.” Eue sagh that the frut was gode and ful gretly lykand; Sho tastid sone and gaf therof till her owen husband. Adam wolde no?t greue his wyf bot sone he ete with hir. Alas, that synne oblisched vs al til wikkid hell-fire! Sone thai were put fro that place to sorow and to care, That neuer my?t no creature recouer it mare. Alle thing vnder heuen made was to mannes solace, And therfor, syn he synned, all thai lesse vertue has. All mankynde for thi was put to thraldom of the fende, And bounden all to his prison ay withouten ende. How may thrall with ri?t clayme a thing of fre heritage? With his lord may he no?t mote, ne non of his lynage. Thus was all this world lost, ther was no help in creature, Bot God wist what was his wil, that of all thing was cure. Of the ten commaundements Then with the x commandements God forbed all synne And taght man how he my?t him gret mede wynne. The first is to worschip on God and no mo. This biddyng sal be vnderstanden so That it forbedes all mamettrie, And also all maner of sorcerie. Mammentrie is to do creature that honour That thou suld do all onely to thi creatour, That is, worschip him for himself ouer all other thing. A seint sal thou worschip, for he is his derlyng. Ymages in the kirk that thou on lokes Are to the as to the clerk are his gode bokes: Thou sal not worschip thaim bot for tha[t] sake That thei bringe to thi mynd thi prayer to make. The second is: tak not the name of thi God in vayn. Ilk fals oth vnleful and idel is theragayn: He is ay in peril of synne dedly That sweres bi Goddis hert or any party. This biddyng forbedes alle heresy, And also all feyned and fals ypocrisy. The thrid is: thou sal kepe wel thi haliday. That is thus mekel openly for to say: Put fro the synne and bodely werkyng, And gif the to God with hertly prayng. Tak kepe her that on halyday marchandyse Lettes man oft of Goddes seruise. The ferd is: worschip thi fader and thi moder. Be way of kynde thes two may no?t be the to der; To thaim ogh thou buxumnes and honour, And also [faith] in thair help and socour. And haly kirk is thi moder gastly And the keper of thi saule thi fadir sot[h]ly. And whoso is thi warldly lord or thi kyng Is taken for thi fadir in this byddyng. The fift is: thou salt no man sle vnlaghfully, That is to say, nother bodely ne gastly, For ille ensaumple, hate, and bakbityng Are [a]lle to thi neghbur gastly sleyng. Hurtyng bothe gastly and bodely is forbed, And wernyng of mete to the pour in peril of ded. The sext is: thou sal don non auoutrie. And this forbedes all maner of lecherie, Bot it be betwix the and thi wyf with gode entent, For to kepe the lagh of God in that sacrament. The seuent biddes that thou sal no thing stele, Ne non othir mannes gode agayns his wille dele. This forbedes fals cautels, deceit, and maystrie, That mas many to loise his gode vnri?twisly, And whoso harmes any man in this maner Sal no?t be saf bot he make asseth at his power. The aghtend is: bere agayn no man fals witnes, And in tyme and maner skilful layne thou sothfastnes, When it is no?t lefful and nedful to say, And al lesyng eschue as wele as thou may. The neyghend is: thi neghbur hous sal thou no?t coueit; In this is forboden assent to wrang and deceit. The tend is: thou sall no?t ?erne another mannes wyf, His seruant, ne his other thing, that may help his lyue. Her is forbeden alle maner of wikked couetyse That myght harme thi neghbur on any maner wise. If slik thoght come to thi hert, thou sal no?t assent, Bot euer agayn stande with gode auysement, And then sal thou no?t falle in dedly synne, Bot ilk a tyme a croun of gret ioye wynne. Thurgh this ten thou may wynne gret ioye and eschewe payn, Bot more help mot open heuen-?ates the agayn. Whoso suld agayn blis to man wynne, Him behoued be a man that my?t no?t synne, And he most ay fulfille alle Goddes wille And neuer in thoght, word, ne dede don non ille. Slik on my?t, if he wald, a gode raunson wage And bye agayn both man and heritage. Bot slik a man in erth my?t neuer be made, If he of all creatours all vertues hade. Of the restoring of the warld A kyng ther was of souerayne worthines, Ful of mercy and wysdam and all godenes. A sone he hadde, knewe all his wille, And my?t and wald al hit fulfille. Thai were ay bothe al on substaunce, And betwix theim was no distaunce: What as the fader wald haue amendyd, By his sone godely hit suld be endid. Four doghters hade this grete kyng, That fulfillid all his likyng. Thai were of his substance ilkon, And all that substance was bot on. Thai four doghters thurgh comune assent Parformed al his iugement; Bot if thise four vse ay wele thair myght, May neuer no rewme be rewled right. The names of thaim withouten les Are Mercy, Sothfastnes, Right, and Pes. Mercy when sho hade parceyued How all mankynde was deceyued Thurgh the fende, that be foul treson Has geten him to his prison, And euermore with enuy Will torment him as enemy, Sho was so stered to compassion That sho wald deliuere that prison. Here spak Mercy Thus til her fader sho began To pray him for synful man: “Dere fader, kyng of my?tes mast, Thi doghter y am, wele thou wast, Ful of myknes, swetnes, and pite; Dere fader, all thes haue y of the. Now here my praier for this prison, That he may be put til his raunson. His enemys with thair falshede Has put him to so gret nede That he may neuer saued be Bot thurgh mercy and gret pite. Thair falshed may gretly letted be, And that prison be ?olden to me. Dere fader, mercyful is thi name, And y thin eldest doghter ame; That y were thi doghter, my?t y neuer say, Bot y wald euer for sinful man pray. Thi mercy thurgh ri?t sall he haue, And thi gret mercy sal him saue. I sal euer crie mercy to the, Til that wreched prison deliuerd be. Dere fader, my praier may no?t be lette, For y am ouer all thi werkes to-sette.” Here spak Sothfastnes When the second sister, Sothfastnes, Hade herd Mercy thurgh her swetnes Wold sone bye the synful prison agayn That sho hade iugged to ay-lastand payne, Sho sayde: “Dere fader, thi doghter am y, As ner sib to the as is my sister Mercy. Mercy of no thing may wele gife the dome, Bot if y, Sothfastnes, with her come; Hir praier may no?t be herd of the, Bot if hit acordand be with me. If all hir prayers suld ay be herd, Neuer no shrewe for the sul[d] be ferd, Ne neuer punist no wikkednes. That is gretly agayns ri?twisnes, For he suld haue no mercy That is dampned ri?twysly.” Here spak Ri?twysnes Then Ri?twisnes, the third sister, sayde: “Dere fader, in me is all dome laide: I ne may no?t spare to say to the: All that Sothfastnes telles to me I mot dele to euerilkone, Gode or ill after thei haue done. Thi wikkid seruant is in prison, As he was demed with gret reson. I may no?t fro this sentence vary Bot I to ri?t wald be contrary. Mercy ne pite is non worthi, For that he lost thaim wilfully.” Alas, catyf prison, now has thou no frende Bot Mercy, that praies for a gode ende! Sothfastnes has accused the, And Ri?twisnes has dampned the; Thou and all that of the come To helle-fire has herd ?our dome. Thin enemy gret stired the to trespas, And Ri?twisnes of the no mercy has. And Mercy may no?t be herd, Therfor Pece may be ferd. When no forgifnes may be, Thai may no?t dwelle in cuntre: All mankynde dyes and is put to payn, Bot Enok and Ely, that sal come agayn. Gret dole is to think on this How al mankinde fordone is. Sothfastnes and Ri?t has geuen thair iuggement, Bot Mercy and Pees were no?t of that assent. If all go bi reddure of Ri?t and Sothfastnes, How sall Mercy and Pes shewe the kinges godenes? If al be thaim one deme Sothfastnes and Ri?t, Mercy and Pece sal loise al thair my?t. Here spake Pece Now Pece to the king begynnes to say: “Faire gode dere fader, thou has loued me ay, Thou art endles of pece, prince, and also king, And euer in pece salt thou be, for ther [is] thi dwellyng. If y for debate suld away fle, Thou suld haue no place lykand to the. Mi two dere susters now haue thai me forsaken, And Mercy with thaim two ?it haue thai not taken; Withouten vs thai be thaimself han gyuen a iuggement That suld haue ben gyuen trewly with comune assent. Therfor hit sal no?t ben of recorde Til we four ben all of on acorde. All erthly thing is made for gode pece, And with[outen] hit may ben non ese. Iustisry is neuer more nedeful Bot when it is to pece spedeful. How suld Right and Sothfastnes auaile, When thai wil no?t call me to thair counsaile, Ne Mercy, my sister, that ay so gode is That withouten hir no gilt amendid is? Therfore out of cuntre wil I fle Til my thre sisters acorded be. If Sothfastnes mete with Mercy, Then sall kis Ri?twisnes and y. The prison calles euer vppon Mercy, And Mercy for him wil ay to the king cry, Til for him be paied al his raunson And he be deliuered out of prison.” Here spak the kinges sone Now the kinges sone has wele sene That debate is his sisters betwene And hit may no?t wele be amesed Bot into his hande it be sesed. He says to that my?ty kyng anon: “Dere fader, thou and I are all on, On substance, on wysdam, and on powere, And God, while the Holy Gast is our fere. All on in substance if we be, Neuertheles in persons we are thre. Thurgh me the warld thou made of no?t, Thurgh me agayn let hit be boght. Mercy has so mekel moued me That of that prison I haue pite. Dere fader, I wil don al thi wille And punysch al that is don ill. I sal take the clething of that wretchid prison, And priuily for him sal I paye raunson. Of his kynde wil I become, And for him wil y take dome. More payn then Ri?t and Sothfastnes wold haue Wil y suffre that prison for to saue. On this maner Sothfastnes and Mercy Sal sone be made gode frendes verraly; Also Pece and Ri?twisnes Thai sal kis with gret swetnes.” Here spak the autour Whoso redes this romance, Trowe in God with on substance, Bot on is God and persons thre, Non othir thing in God may be. Four sisters that we before rede Are four vertues in the godhede; To four doghters thai haue lyknyng, For thai procure all gode doyng; Bot all thai are on God of my?tes mast, He is Fader and Sone and Haly Gast. If thou trowe this wele and stedfastly, Thou may haue mede ay-lastan[d]ly. Here spak the king The kyng has herd his awen sones speche, That of all the warld is a god leche. “Dere sone,” he says, “thurgh the I made all thing, And all the warld hynges in thi keping; Thou and the Haly Gast with me Dose all gode dede that done sal be. Our dede may neuer departid be, For all on God in kynde are we thre. All only thou sal take manhede, Bot all we thre sall do the dede, Ri?t as two virgyns clethes the third, And ?it none of thaim bot on is cled. Dere sone, this was our al thre purpos and curage, When we made man to our liknes and ymage. This hight y to Abraham and to Dauid, And my prophetes acorded therwith. If mankynd sal out of his prison wynne, A man mot for him dye that has no maner synne, That is of my?t to ryse fro dede to the lyue And his with him out of prison ryue. And siche my?t ther be neuer non Bot he were bothe god and man. Dere sone, if thou wil dye and suffre payne, Bothe aungel and mankynde may be ful fayne. That souerayne grace and meknes Sall be so ful of swetnes That neuer may man wele haue in his mynnyng Bot he be sterid to loue the ouer al thing, And titter be reson his hert suld brest, Then he for any thing suld breken thi hest.” Of Ysaies prophecies Off Ihesu Crist telles Ysay To all mankynde verrayly How a child is born til vs, And a sone is gyuen til vs; His name sal be callid wonderful, Counsellour and god and strenghtful, Fader of the warld that sal come, And prince of pece sal be his nome. Here spake the autour Iff any best in shap passed cours of kynde, A wonder in that wald many man fynde, Bot if a parfit man were a parfit as, Mikel more meruayl wald man say it was. Bot more maruayl may who so can How verraily is on bothe god and man, For he wald saue mankynde, that fouly was lorn, Child of an erthly woman wald he be born. Syn God in erth for loue of man wald mak his halle, Nede it was to make it best and fairest of alle. How Ihesus entred into a castil Therfor a castel has the king made at his devys, That thar neuer drede assaut of any enemys. He sette hit on a whit roche thik and hegh, With gode dykes al aboute depe and dregh. Men may neuer with no craft this castil doun ruyne, Ne may neuer do harme to hit no maner engyne. This castil is euer ful of loue and of grace, To al that any nede has socour and solace. Four toures ay hit has and kernels fair, Thre bailliees al aboute that may no?t apair. Nouther hert may wele thinke ne tung may wel telle Al the bounte and the bewte of this ilk castell. Seuen barbicans are sette so sekirly aboute That no maner of shoting may greue fro withoute. This castel is paynted without with thre maner colours: Rede brennand colour is aboue toward the fair tours, Meyne colour is ymyddes of ynde and of blewe, Grene colour be the ground, that neuer changes hewe. Thes colours beth [fer] and nere castes so mekil li?t That when men behaldes thaim, comfort mekil thair si?t. The castel al within, who[so] may hit knawe, Ay is blaunched als whit as any dryuen snawe. Four fair stremes in hit out of a welle springes, Fro myddes the hegh tour thai fille the dykinges; So fair and so gode that liquour ther is That he that drank oght therof my?t haue mekel blis. A chaier of yuor ther was sette in this ilk tour, With seuen grees vpward with worschip and gret honour; Was neuer non half so fair in this warld sene, Ne neuer non so semly hade prince ne quene. Hit was made sotilly and al be compas cast; The raynbowe enuyround it al stedefast. The kynges sone has made it for his awne se; Was ther neuer non so fair ne neuermor sal be. What betokenes this castil This castil of solas and of socour Is hir blissed body that bar our saueour. Hit was made for refuyt to all manes kynde; Whoso fles therto, socour sal he fynde. The roche whit and fair with his stablenes Is the hert of hir in al halynes, That sette hir to serue God withouten any drede In souerayne clene meknes and clene maydenhede. The grene colour bi the ground, that wil so wele last, Is the treuth of our lady, that ay was stedefast. The meyne colour in the myddest of this castil walle Was stable hope to come to grace, that saue mankynd sall. The rede colour abouen, brennand in the si?t, Was brennand loue of God and man, that gyues mykil li?t. No wonder [i]f this castil ware ful whit withinne, For the hert of that may was neuer foulyd with synne. The four toures gret and strong, that fair were to se, Ware gastly strenght and sobernes, ri?t and sutilte; Thes four vertues stekes out al maner of wykkednes And kepes fast withynne al that is godnes. The baillies, on ay withynne another in thre stage, Are clene maydenhed and moderhed and trewe spousage; Woman with thes thre, bot Seint Mary, was ther neuer non, Bot whoso sal be sauf of synne, of thes he most haue on. Seuen barbicans fair seuen vertues calle we, That in our lady suffred no vice for to be, For gret meknes in hir hert venquist ay al pride, And hir gret charite enuy my?t not abyde; Hir discrete abstinens fordid al glotonye, And hir clene maydenhed suffred no lecherie; Wikkid couetyse in hir hert my?t neuer dwelle, For wilful pouert in hir hert keped the castil; Pacience in hir hert euer was so prest That synne of wrath therin my?t neuer haue rest; Ther was so mekil in hir hert of comfort gastly That ther my?t neuer synne of slewth dwelle therby. The fair welle in the castil, that filles ay the dykes, Is grace in Goddes moder, that synful man ay likes. Thou that myster has of grace, go to this spring-welle: Whoso help has of hir, sal neuer go to helle. Make the dykes of meknes and of gode wille, And four stremes of that grace sal the sone fille. On streme euermore sal the clene wasch of synne that is past, Another agayn temptacion sal make the stedefast, The thirde sal stere the to do werkes of charite, And the ferd sal ber the to blis that ay sal be. This welle is euermore springand mercy and pite: If thou haue no part therof, it is al lange on the. The trone of yuor is the saule of our swete lady; Seuen grees that lys therto are werkes of mercy; The raynbowe that bendes ouer with his colours thre Is the my?t that couers hir of the haly trinite. No wonder if this castel wer ful fair in si?t, When God, the sonne of ri?twisnes, wald therin li?t! He come thurgh the cloise ?ate, and when he went, clois it was, Ri?t as the bri?t sonne-beme comes and goos thurgh the glas. Al that man nede has [is] in this ilk castell; He that help has of hit has ynogh of wele. Here spak the autour Gentil lady of this castell, Let me my myscheue to the telle! Moder of mercy and qwene of pite, To synful man thou art ay avowe; Ther[for] at thi ?ates now y lye, Thi help and mercy for to crye. Mercy sal y fast crie befor this louely tour, Euer til I fynde sum of thi socour. Hope of help me made hider for to fle, When thre gret enemys fast pursued me. On is the foule fende with al his companie, That puttes forth pride and wrath and gret enuye; The secund is the fals warld with many schrewed gyse, That shotes ay at me sha[r]ply with all couetise; The third is myn awne flesch, to me a gret enemy, That prickes me with lecherie, sleuth, and glotony. Welle of mercy, I be ded and sone al fordon Bot a streme of thi grace come to me sone. Lady, let me lye in thi castel dyke And wasch me wele ther to thi seruant like; Then if myn enemys wil me assaile, In traist of thi gode help y tak that bataile. In this castil Ihesu Crist tok of the mankynd, Therfor hope y euer hir socour for to fynde. Here hid God his gret power in mannes liknes, And laide enbuschement for the fend and al his wi[k]kednes. Thou art the ?ert of Aaron that bar the faire flour, When thou in clene maydenhede bar thi creatour. Thou art the stegh of Iacob, thurgh wham is gate to heuen. He may hope wele of help that deuoutly wil the neuen. The kinges sone of al this world ligh the withynne, For to saue and socour wel al synful man of synne. Now he has acorded alle his sisters foure, And Pece is cryed for man heghe vp in the toure. Now God and man are togeder both in o person, Now has man ynogh wharwith to bye him fro prison; Now on man more parfit and withouten lak Than euer was Adam ar he Goddis biddyng brak, He is fre to plede for vs and al our ri?t dereigne, And no creature may haue cause vpon him to pleyn. In token of the prince of pees when he til vs come, Pees was oueral in the world and reuling was in Rome. Ioye is sungen now to God vpon hegh in heuen, And pes in erthe til al man that are of gode wil euen. How Ihesus was gode counseillour Now, man, behold thi saueour, Howe he was gode counseillour, To bringe the to thin heritage, That was forfet thurgh outrage. If thou wil ay folowe his rede, Thou sal eschue ay-lastand dede, And so recouer the ioye of heuen, If thou wil folowe his counseill euen. When he for the become man here, He fand the a thrall, of no power For to recouer that thou had lost, Bot he for thi ri?t wold pay the cost. Then souerayn meknes and charite Schewed Ihesu Christ, thi lord, for the. “Dere brothir,” he said, “of the I haue pite grete, That al thi fair heritage fouly is forfait. Neuerthelees fal no?t in despeir, For of that heritage y am heir. To double ri?t hit falles to me, The ton of thaim y may wele gyf the; If thou wil kepe my comaundement, Thou sal ay haue it verrament, For I am God, blis is bounden to me so fast That y may neuer fro me hit cast; For I am of Adam kynde and withouten synne, I may clayme his heritage and bi skil hit wynne. If thou [wil] ouer al thing ri?t hertly loue me And loue thin euencristen for the loue of me, All thin enemys the agayn sal no thing auaile, And y sal sone for thi sake to me ta this bataile. If thou wil hald [in] thi hert how y for the sal fi?t, Mi ?ok sal ay be swete to the and my birthin ful li?t. Lerne at me, for I am mylde and also meke of hert; Therto may mekel help ay wilful pouert: Meknes is a verray token of him that is in grace, And pride an euidence of him that charite non has. He that settes his hert to mekel on riches, Thai drawe him sone te pride fro vertue of meknes.” Here spak the autour Now sues that man his lordes counsail That al to the contrary dos trauail. How may he socour seke of Ihesu meknes That settes himself to mekel vpon heghnes? Therfor drede he may that so wil him bere Of a foul falling doun with Lucifer. Neuerthelees a riche man with his ri?twisnes, And he loue ay God wele in hertly meknes, He may wele saue his saule with fast fleyng of synne And with werkes of mercy the ioye of heuen wynne. How Ihesus mot with the fende Now here how thi lord mette for thi ri?t, Atte last for thi loue put him to fi?t. When the godhede was hid in the mankynd, And the fende in him no synne my?t fynde, He tempted him with thre thinges that made Adam dede. “If thou be Goddes sone,” he said, “make of stones brede!” “Noght only thurgh brede,” quod Ihesu Crist, “leues man, Bot thurgh ich word that comes of Goddes wysdam.” The fend sette Crist on the temple and bad him lepe doun, Goddes aungeles to kepe him suld be redy and boun; If he were Goddes sone, in handes thai suld him bere, So at no ston suld he stumble ne nothing suld him dere. “Writen,” quod Ihesu Crist, “in haly writ y rede: Thou suld not tempte God, thi lord, when thou has no nede.” The fend shewid him al the warld and saide: “This gif y the, If thou wil bowe doun to the ground and so adour me.” “Writen it is,” quod Ihesu Crist, “thi God sal thou adoure, And only sal thou serue him with so mekil honoure.” “Go, Satanas,” quod Ihesu Crist, “for the am y no?t ferd!” “And I am prince,” quod the fend, “of this midlerd; I haue gode sesyn therynne and of ful lange tyme, And be confermyng of God al mankynd is myne, For man brak Goddes bydding and of the appel ete, He sal be in payn with me euermore, I the hete. God wil not do so gret wrong to reue me my pray: If he haue any ri?t, let se what he can say! The couenant that God made that sal I alway hold, No man for to breke it sal neuer be so bold.” “Man,” quod Ihesu, “hade keped al Goddes biddyng, Hade he no?t be lettid with betrayng, When thou saide til Eue: ‘For that mete sal no?t man dye, Bot ?e sal be as goddes, bothe wyse and sle.’ How may thou couenant reioys be reson That thou made man to breke be thi foul treson?” “Alas,” then quod the fend, “wher hade thou this connyng For to venquys me today thus with thi motyng? Mote euermore how as thou mote will, Man sal euermore be in my prison stille, Bot if thou, before he passe forth, Paye as mekil raunson for him as he is al worth.” “That is reson,” quod Ihesu Crist, “and that ful verrailye. I wil no?t tak man fro the with vnskilful maistrie. Loke what his raunson sal be skilfully, And I sal paye hit for him, and that ful largely.” “Better then,” quod the fend, “sal his raunson be Then al this ilk warld is worth that thou now may se.” “I graunt,” quod Ihesu Crist, “to this couenant, For my lest fynger is mekil more vailiant Then a thousand worldes, if that thai ware.” “Certes,” quod the fend then, “that is al my care, For of al this warld ay y haue sum skill, Bot in the is no thing sene at myn awen will. And if thou wil gyue thi fynger him to bye, Than sal thou make a febil marchandie, And ?it most thou suffre for him als mekil payn As he hade done, and he in helle euer hade layn.” Ihesu said: “I sal do more than thou has ast, And this couenant betwix vs sal be made ful fast.” Then the fend him to the dede as for his prison toke, And choked on the godhede as fisch dos on the hoke. Of Cristes passion Behald now the passion of Cristes manhede, How he gaf al himself to socour the at nede, Both body and saul and his lymes alle Lete punysch for the when that thou was thrall. Thre and thirty ?ere for the to bye thi forfete, He suffred cold, hunger, and thrist, and trauail wonder grete. Befor that he for synne of man til his passion ?ode, He prayed so hertly til his fader that he swette blode. He was tane as a thef and bounden wonder fast, And bette with hard knotty stringes whil thei wold last; Fro the croun of the hed to the fote-sole No pece of his skyn my?t be founden hole. Fete and hande wer drawen out and nayled to the tre, As straitly for more penaunce as euer thai my?t be. He was lifted vpon hegh and leten doun so fast That all the vaynes and the synnues in his body brast. All that blissed body stremed doun of blode, For to wasch synne ther was a noble flode. His saule ful drery agayn the deyng To make asseth for thi saule wikked likyng The sharp croun of thornes crouned him so fast That the sharpnes of thaim into the brayn brast, And then he henged doun his heued with mekel meknes For to make asseth for mannes proudnes. His eghen wex fade and dym and lost al thair my?t For to make asseth alway for synne of mannes si?t. His eres hard fals reproues with gret scornyng For to make asseth fully for synne of our hering. His neys smelled of the Iewes snot and foul spitting That thei cast vpon his face to blode and sweting; This suffrance of Ihesu Crist, that lord is of al thing, May make asseth for all synne of our smelling. Bitter aisel and galle, when he was thristy, Drank he to make fully asseth for mannes glotony. When he was aght dayes old, with a culter of stone Thai karf his tendre membre away, that bi the lagh was don; This penance of that child, that was so worthi, Mi?t make asseth for synne of mannes lechery. Al the body aboute with brising and beting Was punysched ynogh for synne of touching. His hende nayled to the crosse al for thi sake May for synne of thin hend asseth ynogh make. His fete nayled thurd with yrne nayles Made asseth for al thi wikkid trauayles. He prayed for man til his fader hyngand an the croys With bittir teres, and ?eld the gast with a gret voys. He was both God and man ful verraily, That so ?elded the gast, lyueand the body, For saule goos neuer fro the body be the cours of kynde, Whyl thou may in the body fyue wittes fynde. Bot God strenghed his body to suffre more reddure Than euer my?t haue suffred any other creature. His hert, that was clouen thurgh with a sharp spere, That may make asseth for al synne that may dere. His hert-blode and clene water was therout bro?t To wasch away al enuy and al ille tho?t. This, of ful gret mercy, is sette on comon broche, And the welle of pite springes out of this roche. If thou wil forsake synne and cry mercy, Thou sal neuer faile therof certaynly. How that thou may synne with any lymme that is thine, A lymme of Crist is punysched to thi medicine. When God thus suffred dede, as we rede in boke, The sunne sone withdrogh his li?t and the erthe whoke, And the vail of the temple euen brast in two, And the harde stones swiftly cleue also; Many a man rose than that were before dede, And al bare thei wittenes of his godhede. Of the sorowe of our lady What sorowe hopes thou then hade his modur Mary, When thing that has no reson for him was so sary! Certes, lady, Symond swerd past thurghout thi hert, And the paynes of thi sone wer in the ful smert, That thi hert hade neuer lasted on non-kyn wyse, Hade thou no?t trewed stedfastly that he suld vprise. Lady, what nede was the for to make sorowe, For thi sone dyed synful man to borowe? Thou wote that he sal ryse agayn thurgh his awen my?t And with a body ful of ioye apertely to thi si?t. Thou wote the fend is venquist and wetes it no?t, Til thi sone out of helle haue al his chosen bro?t. [For] he dyed til he rose that [men] my?t him se, Alle the trewth of hali kerk was stedfast in the. Alle his awen disciples of him thai wer dredand, Bot the faith in thi hert ay it was lastand. Dere lady, succour vs of dedly synnyng For the ioye that thou hade of his vprising! How Ihesus is almy?ti He rose by his awne my?t, and that verraily, And shewed so that he was Ihesus almyghti. He that al this warld made first of ri?t no?t, Man dampned agayn with his blode he bo?t. Thus has he gyuen vs a gode counsail, And thurgh ri?t venquist the fend in batail. His lyf has shewed vs a ful redy gate For to entre if we will in-with heuen-?ate, For we sul traist on him in al our nede: He shewed vs the my?t of God in his manhede. Power of God and man was mellid in his dedis, And that to stablenes of our treuth gretly spedis. Ri?t as a sharp swerd of the fire al glowand The egge kerues, if he smyte, the hete is brenand, So godhede and manhede in o person Shewed thair kyndnes to mannes reson. We rede when he was called til a weddyng, Whan thaim failed wyne, sone at his bydding, Thai filled pottes of clene water in the stede of wyne, And thai wer turned into wyne, and that gode and fyne. When he bad fette water, he shewed his manhed, And when he turned hit to wyne, he shewed his godhed, For he my?t haue made wyne withouten water bro?t, Ri?t as he made, when he wald, al the warld a no?t. Also with fyue loues and only fisches two He fedde, as we rede, fyue thousand and mo; When thai hade eten ynogh, all that ther were, Twelf lepes of relef ful away thei bere. His manhed to thaim all delt bret and fische, Bot his godhed ther multiplied al this. ?it we rede that Lazar hade [lain] four dayes in his graue, When Ihesu Crist fro ded to lyue wald him vp haue; First he grette and sithen he cryed to Lazar, That shewed that he was verray man thar. When Lazar rose fro the ded and [did] mannes dede, Then was shewed that in Crist was verray godhede. Of the sacrament of the auter God of all his meruailes made vs a gode mynd, When he wold in forme of brede dwell with mankind. Thurgh the vertue of Cristes wordes of the sacrament That the prest reherces at his messe with gode entent, Brede into Cristes flesch and wyne into his blode Sudanly is turned for mannes gastly fode. Nother brede ne wyne is after sacryng in the messe Bot verray Goddes flesch and blode in thair liknes. Ther is of brede and wyne sauour, colour, and figure, Lastand thurgh Goddes wil agayn cours of nature, But vnder this liknes is non other substance Bot Goddes body and his blode with thair purtenance. In Crist God and man, saul and body, flesch and blode Are so fast knyt togeder with kynde and loue gode That whar that is any party of Cristes awen body Ther will God be, and tha[t] all verraily. Therfor vndir liknes both of wyn and brede Is verray both God and man that for vs was dede. This is Goddes dede and passes mannes wit, He has mekel mede that trewly trowes hit. In this liknes gyues hit vs God, that is so gode, For we wald be escheu of rawe flesch and of blode. Brede and wyne in the stomak taken to mete Turnes into flesch and blode thurgh kyndly hete. Whi may no?t God then, that al thing made of no?t, And, as haly writ sais, many wonder wro?t, Turne sone into flesch and blode both brede and wyne, For to be to cristen man gastly medicine? If thou receyue his flesch and blode worthily, Thou sal be as quik lym of his body, And if thou kepe the so out of dedly synne, As a cosyn of his thou sal heuen wynne. The pask-lambe in the ald lawe that al men suld ete And man that God send fro heuen til his folk mete And blod that was euer offrid for clensyng of synne Was taken of his sacrament, that our help is ynne. All the tokens of this sacrament that we ay can fynd In the old lawe trugh trouth of this comes til our mynd, And all the maruailes that God [wro?t], ar he man ware And [boren] of that clene mayden and modir that him bare. If man wil with al his my?t loue this sacrament And vse hit out of dedly synne ay with gode entent, Nother tunge may wel telle ne hert may wel think The noble and gastly profit of this mete and drink. How Ihesus is al strenghty Now hast thou herd wele how Ihesus is almy?ty, Here now how he is ouer al other strenghty. This name of Ihesus has so gret in him vertu and my?t That all in heuen, erth, and helle suld til him loute with ri?t. Oft in this name God mannes prayer spedes Agayn the fend that hit ful mekil dredes. This name is mirthe in hering and comfort in si?t, Triacle in mouth and in hert that is of mekil my?t, Socour to all synful men, and to seke solace, To him that is repentant ay ful of grace. The fend was prince of this warld and hade man in prison Ay til our [lord] Ihesu Crist hade suffred passion. Ther was non so hely that my?t in erth dwell Bot his saule, qwen he died, suld go to hell. Hely men wer in merknes, ther thai no payn feld, Bot the fend fro thair ioye agayn thair wil thaim held, And the ?ate of paradys was agayn thaim stoken, Til Ihesus with his passion hade made it open. When the fende sagh him wele on the crois hyngand, He wend to haue made him forth ay in hell lengand, Bot sone the saul with the godhede as a fer lyon And a kyng of al the warld, and no?t as a prison, Come to hell and brast thair barres with his will fre, And toke out all anon with him that dyed in charite. Him calles men a lord strong and my?ty, That has ay, when he wil, in batail the maistry. Sone he venquist the fend and cuttyd his power, That he suld no?t tempt vs more then we mi?t ber. Thus is Ihesus our refut, strenght, and socour, Our help and our hele, our ioye and our honour. How Crist is our fader gastly Here now how Crist was our formfader gastly, Ri?t as Adam was to man formfader fleschly. All that was of Adam born lost heuen for his synne, And all that Cristes children will be bi him may hit wynne. Baptisme has the vertu of Cristes hert-blode, To make thaim his childer that wil take hit with gode. Thus ri?t as al men dyed thurgh Adam, So may al be quikned agayn in Cristes name. Was neuer no fader that any son so der hade bo?t As Crist, that man wesch of synne and out of prison bro?t. In fourty houres after his ded herged he helle, [,] And apered to his disciples in many maner wyse, To proue soth that he said that he suld vprise. He ete and drank with thaim ichon ri?t in thair si?t, And spak that was nedeful to thaim, mekel of gastli li?t, And elleuen of thaim he blamed sithen, For thei trowed no?t that he was vprisen. Bot it was til our faith ful heply That Thomas of Ynde trowed lattly, Til he into Crist hert-wond hade put his hand. Than said he: “Thou art my god and my lord lyuand!” “For thou has sene me,” quod Crist, “now thou trowes ri?t; Blissed be tha[t] trowes wele withouten any si?t.” When our faith was thus confermed, as thou has wele hard, Then bad Crist thei suld it preche thurghout al the warld And [baptize] all that wald be in trouth stedfast In the name of the Fader and the Son and the Haligast, For ther [may] neuer non in heuen-blis wone Bot he thurgh baptyme be made Cristes awen sone. In this fader was neuer no wemme of synne, The[r]for be him may [we] blis clayme and wynne. Adam come of erth and band vs all to prison; Crist then come fro heuen and payed for vs raunson. When he stegh vp agayn to heuen riche blis, He tok al the ded with him that was his; Ther he haldes sesyn in his heritage To al that wil folow him of his lynage. Thar Fader and Sone and Haligast Are all on God of my?tes mast. Insi?t of this thre persons in on godhede Sal be in heuen our gret ioye and our mede. Then sal we [se] in that ioyfulnes How Crist, our der fader, is verray prince of pees. When Ihesu Crist of heuen had wonnen his gret ri?t, Then was sent the haligast anon, as he hade hi?t. His disciples hertes anon he wald enspire In the fader liknes with tunges of fire; So the haligast was send and sett thaim aboue, That of the fader and the sone is the gode loue And is al on God with thaim in verray vnite, Bot he is third person in the trinite. When thei wer thus fulfilled of the haligast, Thai couth wele al langage and speke hit sone in hast; Thai were so confermed in trouth and al ful of grace That for to preche Goddes lawe thai dred no kinges face. Of the articles of trouth Here now of the articles of our trouth that we al traist inne, And the seuen sacrament? that soccours vs of synne. We sal trowen in on God of my?tes althermast, That is the Fader and the Sone and the Haligast; None is other of this persones thre, Bot all are on God in [the] trinite. Thes thre are on God and on verray nature, That made first of ri?t no?t al maner creature. We trowe in haly kirk and haly mannes dedes, That God ay with his grace thaim strenghtes wel and spedes In trouth and sacrament? and dedes of charite, Thurgh whilk to the repentant forgifnes of synne sal be. He that trowes no?t as hali kirk is in dedly synne, And mede in heuen in that state may he neuer wynne. At day of dome sal al mankynd vprise, For to take ay-lastand dome on many diuers wise: The gode sal go to heuen to ay-lastand blis, And the wikkid to helle-fire that ay-lastand is. The aghtend article is of Cristes manhede, How Mary conceyued him in clen maydenhede; When the aungel Gabriel come and gret hir with gode, The haligast made a body of hir clennest blode And put a saul into hit that al wysdam can; Then God the Sone toke that and become man. The neghend is that he of Maiden Mary was born, And no thing of hir maydenhede therfor was lorn. The tend is that he suffred paynes wilfully, Al to ded opon the crois and biryng of body. The elleuend [is] that Crist in saule went doun to hell And toke out al his awen chosen that with him suld dwell. The twelft is that he rose fro dede on the thrid day And apperyd qwik in flesch with many tokens verray. The thrittend is that he stegh vp hegh into heuen, Ther he sittes in manhed with his fader euen. The fourtend is that he sal come vpon domesday And gyue ri?twis dome to qwik and dede, that sal last ay. Of the seuen sacraments ?et the seuen sacrament? are nedful to kenne, For baptyme of al synne may soccour all men, For who as taas hit lawefully, Of synne is clensed al fully. The secund sacrament is confermyng, That agayn the fend is a gret strenghting. The third is the sacrament of the auter, That is declared a litel befor here. The ferth is penance ordaynd for mannes synne; This lawefully has thre parties him withinne: Sorow of hert, schrift of mouth, and asseth-making; This thre of mede and grace bringes agayn taking. The fift sacrament is for seke men anoynting: This is soccour agayn al uenial synnyng. The sext is ordour that clerkes has on diuerse wise, And therthurgh has diuerse power in Goddes seruise. That seuend betwix man and woman is wedding For remedie of lecherie and childer nurishing. Thurgh gode and laweful vsyng of any of this seuen May men wele escheu payn and li?tly come til heuen; Grace in this seuen heles man of al gastly sore, And seuen vertues ables him that thou red before. Seuen giftes of the haligast helpes ay his dede, And seuen maner of blis parfourmes his mede. Of the seuen giftes of the haligast The first gift, dred of God, puttes fro man pride mast And makes him wele-manerd, pouer in hert and tast, And that are thus meke in hert and pouer gastly, Crist blesses thaim alway, and heuen is thaires treuly. The second gift is pite, that puttes out enuy And makes man to worschip God, his fader gastly, And Goddes lawe and his neghbour for Goddes awen sake; And thes gode dedes gode, benigne, and myld wil him make; Thai that has vertuously that ilk myldnes Ay sal haue lyuyng in mekil blissednes. The third gift is cunnyng, that puttes away wrath And mas man to loue godenes and with wikkednes to wlath, And haue sorow for his synne and taryyng of blis, For this is man blissed, and heuen sal be his. This gift of cunnyng may no?t ful longe be Withouten gastly ioye and gret charite. The ferth gift is gastly strenght, that puttes away slouth, And to eschape all perils mas man to haue trouth; Hit mas man to suffre wel and long to bide ri?t, And ri?t be done to God and man ?erne with al his my?t. And whoso has this ?ernyng and hungres ri?twisnes, Thai sal be fulfilled of hit and haue gret blissednes. That fift gift is counsail, that fordos couetise, And in hegh thing and hard mas man of gode auyse; Hit mas man ay gode and benigne in alkyn thinge, And rewles hym wele in warkes of mercy-doyng. And all that warkes of mercy dos deuoutely Are blissed of Ihesu Crist and ay sal haue mercy. The sext gift is vnderstanding, that glotery fordos, And stires to certayn trouth that him gastly behose, And makes him of all synne clene in hert to be. Suche men are blissid of Crist, for thai sal God se. The seuent gift is wysdam, that fordos lecherie, And confortes man in ioye of God and pes swetly, And mas man to kepe and make pees with gret besines. Siche are called Goddes childer and sal haue blissednes. In suffring oght for ri?t standes the aghtend blis, And who as euer suffres so, the rewme of heuen is his. Of Antecristes commyng That tyme when God wil suffre before the [day] of dome, To tempte and pursue cristen men Anticrist sal come. He sal be born in Babiloyn of the kynd of Dan, That sum tyme her in erth of Iacob childer was an. He sal regne in Iersalem and himself [Crist] call; Then many of the[s] wretched Iewes sal fast til him fall. When he mas him God, his gode aungel sal him forsake; Then the fend sal him enspir and hede of wikkednes make. He sal feyne thurgh fendes craft ner al Cristes meruailes, Bot ay in him charite, mercy, and meknes failes. Simple men sal he deceyue with miracles-doyng, Couetous with gret giftes and gode with punysching. He sal make men as God to adour his ymage, And on thair [forehed] bere a mark of his seruage. Whoso has no?t that mark, sal nouther bye ne sell, Bot Antecristes tyrant sal thaim to ded quell. Be reson and in haly writ it is Goddes sawe: Thurgh payn sal God neuer stresse man to forsake his lawe, Bot what as any man dos her with his fre will, Sal turne him, after it is, to gode or to ill. Betwix Antecristes comyng and his gret ill-doyng Sal Ely and Ennok com preche for mennes sauyng; Then Antecrist sal sle thaim in Iersalem, And God sal raise thaim to lif and tak thaim to his leme. Bot thre ?ere and a half sal Antecrist haue maistry, For to saue his chosen that ordayns Goddes mercy. Then thurgh Goddes my?t sal that wikked be slayn, And all chosen that trespast then sal turne agayn. The[n] ful many Iewes sal turne to Cristes lawe, And hali kirk sal liue in pes out of tyrant? awe Shortir tyme or lenger til that Crist wil come, To make the worldes ende and gif his grete dome. Of the day of dome In the same fourme in whilk Crist suffrid payn To deme both qwhik and ded he sal come agayn. Then sal he shewe his body stremand al on blode And his hert clouen in two, as he henge on rode, And say: “For ?ow suffred I al this gret payn, Telles now what ?e to me has done theragayn!” Allas! what may then til him synful man say, That neuer wele withouten synne spendes on day. Man sal ?elde acompt then of al that God him sende, Body and saul, witte and gode, how he has it spende, And of ilk an ydel word that euer he here spak; In wikked word and wikked dede then sal be gret lak. After that degre of synne or of charite That any man dyes inne sal he domed be. Than sal clere conscience be mekil more of-told Than any gret lordship with a world ful of gold, For al sal then perisch that we here now make, And synful man sal for drede sore tremble and qwak. All synne for whilk is no?t worthily asseth made her Bes shewed ther al openly to shame and gret ler. Ilk a man then sal se his dome verraily, And for gret drede of God thus sal thei all cry: “Montayns, falles doun on vs for to hid vs, That we se no?t the wrath of God, that is so hedous. Allas! that euer wer we born anything to craue, For withouten ende we are lorn, for nothing may vs saue. Alas, alas, and wele-away! wherof may we ?elp? Whe are shent foreuer and ay, for no thing may vs help.” Haly writ sais that befor this dome Ouer al this wide warld a huge fire sal come. Seint Peter sais that then al sal brenne; Erth and water and al the warld and al that is therinne, Heuens and ayr and all the elements Fire thurgh brennyng then sal clens; Fire sal no?t touche heuen in the whilk is blis, Bot other heuens that vnder hit is. The fire sal purge venial synne, And ful hard pyne thaim that dedly [synne] is inne; Hit sal fordo thing that sal no?t endure, And make al the remanant of fairer figure. Then al the qwik bestes sal tak thair endyng, That were made bot for a tyme of mannes leuyng. The four elements sal be farer seuen fold Then euer thai were any tyme other newe or old. Ther sal be no chaunging fro cold to the hete, Ne non other tempest of wynd and wedirs gret; Al cold and hete, foul venum, fylth, and stynk, For to punish thaim in hell sal doun then synk. The heuens sal no?t turne aboute bot stand ay in rest, The sunne ay in the est, the mone in the west; Ilkon sal be more clere seuen fold than he was, Bot[h] to Goddes worschip and to mannes solas. This sais God bi Ysaie, that his wil wele knewe: “Lo, I make both heuens and erth all span-newe.” This fairnes of the warld sal dampned men no?t se, For thai sal be in helle-payne or that fairnes sal be. First when God wil, sall aungeles a gret noyse make, And Crist thaim that are in blis sal with him take. Then the remanant that sal be in that blis faire Sal be rauyst him agayn vp into the aere. All sall ryse fro ded to lyf of Adames lynage Als in thair awen statur of thritty ?er age. All Goddes chosen then sal ful parfit be Withouten any foulnes or superfluite. Then sal Crist say to thaim on his ri?t honde A gode word of all wordes comfortande: “Come, ?e my fader blissed, and haues the reume of heuen, That befor the warld was made [was] ordaynd ?ow ful euen! ?e gaf me mete, whan I was hungry; ?e gaf me drynk, whan y was thristy; When I hade nede, ?e harbard me; When I was naked, ?e cleded me; ?e visit me, when I was seke, And in prison ?e wald me seke. That ?e did for my loue to the lest of myne, That same ?e did to myself, theron sal ?e no?t tyne.” Then wikked men for heuenes of synne Sall no?t agayn Crist into the aier wynne Bot thai on the erth [sal] Cristes wordes here, That sal be to thaim withouten ende a lere, When he sais: “Go, waried, into the fire of helle, Thar ?e in payne withouten ende with the fend sal dwell. ?e serued neuer ioye ay-lastandly, For ?e fulfilled no?t the warkes of mercy.” Take now gode kepe here, wardly cristen m[a]n, And do thi saule profit als wele as thou can! Thurgh warkes of mercy may men heuen wynne, And thai that dos thaim no?t sal no?t come therinne. Bot ther are seuen warkes of mercy bodely, And also other seuen warkes of mercy gastly; Thurgh trewe kepyng of any of this seuen May a trewe cristen man wel come to heuen. Sex bodely warkes has thou befor redde, The [seuent] taght Tobie when he beryd the dede. Seuen gastly warkes, that are of more mede, May thou hald in thi mynd to thin awen spede. The first is for to teche the vncunnand, The second is to counsail the doutand, The thrid is to confort him that is sorowful, The ferth is to chasty him that is in synne wilful, The fift is to forgif him that has ill wratthed the, The sext is to support him that irksum is to the, The seuent is to pray to God for all thes hertely, That he amend thaim of thair faute thurgh his gret mercy. Of the paynes of hell Turne we now agayn sumwhat for to telle Of the orrible paynes that ay are in helle. Helle is a depe pit stynkand with all myrknes, Ther the dampned ay sal be halden in gret distres. All that is in the warld of filth and of stynk At day of dome sal doun thedir synk, For to eke thair stynkand payne al be hit gret, For ther sal be of hell-fire wondir huge hete. That brennand fire withouten ende so gretly hit glowes That al the watur in the warld may not sloken his lowes. Ther is als gret cold on another side; Ther sudanly for more payne into hit sal thei glide. Thai sal no?t haue no roume theron beside another, Bot all be cast on a hepe as of turf a fother. Ilkon sal stynk on other and double his payne, And ilkon ay to greue other sall be ful fayne. Ther sal be gnasting of teth for gretnes of payne, And euer in the hert a sorowe souerayne, That thai haue lost for a litil lykyng of synne The ioye of the si?t of God, that al godenes is inne. And this worme of conscience sal bit thaim euermore And ouer all paynes ay be to thaim a sore. No likyng sal thai haue, shortly for to say, Bot al thing agayn thair wil that thaim gref may, And thus sal thai be punist ay-lastandly Withouten hope of mercy or any remedy. Of the ioyes of heuen Thair ioye in heuen sal wele more be Then any hert may think or any egh se, Ne non ert[h]ly mannes ere may wele here The ioye that God has ordaynd til his awen dere. This ioye sall haue then ay-lastand sekirnes, For Crist, kyng of ioye, sal then be prince of pes. Ilk mannes body of thaim that God wil saue Four fair dowers of ioye in heuen sal haue. First the body sal be parfit there, That no thing in al the warld my?t him [d]ere; All the fir of hell my?t him neuer brenne, If he neuer so lange were laide therinne. The second dower of the body sal be bri?tnes, That man sal haue that dede in gastly clennes. Ilk a body sal be there seuen [fold] more bri?t Then the sunne is here when it most li?t, And this gret bri?tnes of the body Sal euermore cleth hit fair and honestly. The third dower of the body sal be sutilnes, For hit sal be so clensid of all rudnes That non ert[h]ly body may lette hit to passe, More then the sunne-beme is lettid be the glas. The ferth dower of the body sal be deliuernes, For hit sal be clensid so wel of alkyn heuynes That sudanly whedir as the saul has ?ernyng Thedir sal the body glide withouten more letting. In thes four dowers sal thi body be so parfit That of all erthly ioye of hit sal be delit. Thre gastly parties of thi saul ioye sal fulfill; Thes are vnderstanding, a mynd, and a will. Vndirstanding that her was in trewth stedfast Of poyntes of our faith that manes [reson past] Sal in clere si?ht of God al that he trowed se, And in that souerayn sair si?t al ful of blis be. All wysdam, al godenes, all fairnes, al my?t Sal rauysh man to the loue of God in that fair si?t. Man sal se in God, as in a myrour, All that he wil or may be to his honour. Ilk man as he deserued mor or lesse her Sal haue ther ay the si?t of God more or lesse cler, Bot al sal be so fully payd in that si?t That couayt clerer si?t non sal haue no my?t, And thus in the saul the vnderstanding Sal ay be fulfilled of ioye and likyng, And this sal be in mannes saul the first dower After that he deserued when that he was her. His will that her loued God ouer al thing And his euencristen for Goddes bidding In the loue of God ther sal be so parfit That al his ?ernyng sal be ful of delit. That loue sal be ay so gret, so gode, and so fair That nothing that may befall sal hit oght empair. His mynd that hoped to haue ioye thurgh grace and mercy And dyed stedfast in trouth withouten synne dedly Sal haue mekil more ioye then he euer wend, And sikirnes that hit last ay withouten end. So sal ilk blissed saul be fulfillid of blis That hit may nothing ?erne thare that hit may mys. He has parfit blis that has al his will, And so be that he t[h]en nothing will ill. Ther sal nothing be that may greue bot al liking That sal ay last sikirly withouten endyng. Sothly thre dowers of the saul are the gret blis, And mannes ioye is mesurd after he has of this. This gret ioye is of Gode loue and likyng and si?t, Al other ioye toward this [is] of litil my?t, As he that has the sunne-li?t vpon a fair day, For many torches if he li?t no better se he may; No?t more li?t bot more maners of li?t he has, And that may be to him a maner of solace. Cler si?t of God sal ther be mannes fode, And bri?tnes of body sal be clething gode. Wark sal be thar of God a mery louyng, That neuer withouten end sal haue irking. If Adam hade lyued to the warldes ende, And al the wittes of all men God had him send, ?it my?t he no?t haue told fully The lest poynt of that ioye verraily. Ther sal be nothing that may displese Bot al honeste and gode that may ese. [Thre] maner of men sal haue a ioye special, That is callid in haly writ of ioye a coronale. Thes thre maners are verray martires, Alle-clene uirgines, and haly techers. Ilkon sal haue ther als [mekil] ioye of othir Als he were a thousand sith his brothir; Ilkon of other ioye sal haue a liking, And that sal be thaim of ioye a doubling. This doubling sal be in noumbre a gretnes, No?t to the ioye before euen mykilnes. After degre of loue of God that man hade her Sal his ioye be mesurd withouten any wer. Man sal haue souerayne ioye in si?t of godhede, And sithen a gret ioye of Crist manhede, That he is both God and man that bo?t him with his blode, And deyned to shewe to man so hertly mekil gode; That his [brother] sal euer be his lord and his god, That sal be a confort to him withouten make od. In himself he has his ioye of al the dowers, Both of body and of saul, as clerkes vs leres. Of the qwene of heuen, our lady Mary, That is Goddes moder and well of mercy, Flour of all uirgines and avowe to mankynd, May all that are in heuen gret confort fynd; Amang all creatures sho has wele of all weles, For sho is moder of the king that al ioye deles. Sithen ix ordres of aungeles confortes man in blis With thair gret myrth and ioyfulnes, that thai may neuer mys. Sithen al maner of men that to blis wendis And specialy all gode men frendes Ekys his ioye and confort when thai are mette, And that sall ay last withouten any lette. ?it heuen and erth and all creatures Sal be to mannes ioye whiles hit endures; All the sorow and paynes of hell ay-lastandly Sall confort him that eschaped thaim thurgh mercy. Thus sal man in heuen ay fynd ioye and leth, Aboue him, withinne him, aboute and beneth. Ay, sais Seint Austyn sothfastly, Man suld forsake resonably All the welthes of this warld euermore and ay For to haue the ioye of heuen only a day. How mekil more then suld man ay forsake synne While he lyued in erth that blis for to wynne? The godenes of God, the fairnes, the wysdam, the my?t, The ioye, the solace, the confort, that ay is in his si?t, Passes all mannes mynd, vndirstanding, and wit, Bot if he may come to blis fully and clerly se hit. Therfor he that all creatures first made of no?t And with his awne hert-blode al mankynd bo?t Thurgh his grace and mercy graunt vs that ioye to se, How thre persones are all on God in trinite. Amen. Here endes the Myrour of Lewed Men. A munk made this myrour only for lewed mennes sake, Thou that will se saule-hele, this thi myrour thou take! KING AND FOUR DAUGHTERS Jhesu Cryst, heuyn kynge, Be at my begyninge. Ther is no man þat may ?elpe Bot he hath nede of Godys helpe. Fader and Sone and Holy Goste, One God of my?htys moste. He helpe vs at oure nede; Wiþouten hym may we not sped. I sate and lokyd on a romance, Was made in þe lond of France; Grostyd it made out of dyuine, All in French out of Latyne. He saw all men hade not vertu To know Latyn, Ebrew, and Grew, The[r]for in French he mad it þer, That men my?t wyte what it were. ?it may not all men French vnderstond, And namely men of Ingelond. Therfor, soth as I þe tolde, Ryme on Inglych make [I] wolde, That men my?ht haue þerof solace. Now, God, þerto gyfe vs grace! De principio creacionis mundi Now at þe fyrst begyninge I schall tell of þe werld makyng, And how it was fyrste gyuen to Adam, Of whom oure fyrst synne camme, And also of paradys iwys, That was full of werldys blys, And of heuen, þat is so hye, How it was lorne thorow folye, How it come after to mankynd, As ?e may afterwerd fynd. Wiþin vj deys ry?ht All þe werld we[s] idy?ht; Allmy?hty God, þat is þe beste, The vij dey he gan reste. Therof ?e haue herd telle. God kep vs fro þe peyn of helle! When God allmy?hty of nou?ht Heuyn and erth all hade wrought, Wiþ all þe pourtynans small and grete, Lord, þat was feyr and swete! Now is þe sone clere and ly?ht: That tyme it was vij so bry?ht; The mone þat schynes no[w] by ny?ht, Than it schone also bry?ht As do[s] þe sone now onne deye. And sey therof no man naye: I tell ?ew now sothlye, It wytnes þe prophet Isaye, And at hym I take wytnesse That euery thyng more and lesse, In erth, in ayer, water, and flode, Seth Adam synned, was not so gode Als it was fyrste beforne, Or Adam and Eue wer forlorne. Lorne was Adam and all hys kynne For þat ilke foule synne, And all þer kynne, as I ?ow telle, Euerychon þei went to helle. Wrong was it not bote skyll, So euery man may [se] þat wyll. Gode is to thinke þeron ary?ht, For to loue God allmy?ht. De medio mundi et de fine When þat God þe werld had wrou?t, So that ther ne feyled nou?ht, Neþer of more ne lesse, Bestys and treys, frute and grasse, Fowlys in þe eyer, fyssches in flode, Sterrys and mone, sone, feyre and gode, At þe laste after all thys Than made he Adam iwys, In þe veyll of Ebron of cley gent, Lyke hymselue verament; After þe holy trinyte He made hys saule, I telle þe; In þe body he dyde a lyuing goste, Of all bestys power gafe hym moste. That was loue and grete grace To make hym lyke hys awne face. He made hym wytty and wyse, And led hym into paradyse. Than thou?ht God allmy?hty þer He wold not he alone were; When þat God thus thou?t and seyd, Clepyd Adam þer he was leyd; Of hys lefte syde he toke a rybe-bone, Therof he made Eue anone. Eue befor Adam he brou?ht, To wytte how he by hyr thou?ht. Than seyd Adam and thou?t it gode: “Thys is my flesch and my blode.” In paradys in that stounde Ther was wedloke fyrst ifonde. For þat skyll euery man of lyfe Is holden to loue hys wyfe, After þat sche is worthey; That wyll God allmy?hty. God gaf þan Adam wytte and skylle, Grete power and fre wylle, Power ouer all erthely thyng, And gaff hym lyfe wiþouten endyng; Of paradys he made hym fre Ouer all thyng, saue a tre. He gafe hym tyme to be þerine, Iff þat he had don no synne, Wiþouten hete, wiþouten chele Ther to a lyffyd in long wele, Wiþouten wo and seknes, Wiþ mekyll ioy and bry?htnes. Seuyn so bry?ht he schuld hafe bene As is þe sone þat now is sene. Syche a blys God had hym lente, And at þe last to heuyn haue went. Now was þer a feyr franches, Was ordenyd to Adam and all hys, Sych an herytage euermo To haue wonyd in wiþouten wo. In paradys Adam had two lawys, As we telle in owre sawys: He schuld haue kepyd in hys lyfe The naturall and þe posytyfe. The naturall law was skyll and ry?ht, To be buxsom to God allmy?ht, That dyde hym þat grete curtasy, Of paradys gaue hym þe masterry. A commandment onne hym he leyde, And off all hys frute he seyde: “Bot a tre I the forbyde, Ete þou not þerof for non nede! Iff þou ete þerof, I þe sey, Sone þerafter þou schall dey. Iff þou my commaundment kepe in pese, Than þou schall haue þat ilke grace. Paradyse and bestys, water and londe Schall be obedyent to þi honde.” Off all þe blys of paradys Adam had seseyn iwys. Alas, sone it was ago, All þe ioy þat he had tho! Alas, þerfor may we synge, And sore wepe and handys wryng! Oure herytage we schuld haue, And we hade not don þat skathe. The comandment we dyd nou?ht; Therfor sore it was bou?ht, And for þat trespas þat was done All we wer made thrall full sone. The naturall and þe posytyfe Adam breke for lufe of hys wyfe; Buxumer he was for to do The dede þat hys wyfe bad hym do, Than to God, þat hym hade wrou?ht. Alas, þerfor, what was hys thou?ht! Than was he oute and had lorne The sesyn þat he had beforne; Hys herytage was hym benome, And all them þat after hym come, Oute of ioy into grete care Hysselue and hys kyne to fare. Wiþ swynke and suete was he bonde— Wher schall any hele be fonde? Alas þat synne, it was so stronge, For among all thing it sprong: Both þe sterres, sone, and mone, Off þat synne þei had to-done; Foulys in þe eyer, bestys in lond, All þei had þerof a onde, Fysschys, erbys, frute, and tre, All þe wers for to be; Euery thyng, both more and les, For þat synne lest ther godnes. Adam for hys defaute iwys Lost hys herytage, and all hys, For syn is non oþer thyng Bo[t] sor defaute of wele-doyng. For defaute he lefte þe ioys suete, And þat was skyll: so do men ?ete; For defaute euery wyght Hys herytage may lese ry?ht. At kyngys courte in euery londe ?it men haue sych lawys fonde. For defaute Adam les That he my?ht haue leuyd in pes. Alas, þat was grete pyte! Now be we thrall þat are wer fre: Thrall he is þat to hym longys What seruys he vnderfongys. He þat is so thrall becom, Hys power is hym benome. When he seruys in seruage, He had no franches of herytage; Than when he is all thrall becom, His fre herytage is hym benome. He may not pleyn in non wys Wiþ whom he is in sych seruys; He ne schuld no thyng be herd, His wordys be all insperd. His herytage if he wyll wynne, He behouys to do anoþer thyng: He muste seke if he may fynd A man þat borne is of fre kynd, And þat he be of ry?ht lynage, For to clame his herytage, And þat he may well and wele canne, And þat he be a gode fre man, That he not of þat appull ete That Adam thou?t fyrst so suete. He behoueth to be wiþoutyn synne, And all oure lawys hym wiþine: The ij lawys of paradys sykerly, And þat of þe mounte of Synay That was gyuen to Moyses, That he held neuer wiþouten les, In whom was se oure wekyd wrynke. Off sych a man who my?ht thinke That my?ht be wiþouten synne, Hys herytage þus to wynne? He[r]on schall my mater duelle, For a tale I wyll ?ou telle That acordys to sych a man. Now wyll I tell ?ow, if I canne. It was a kyng nobull and riche, That had a sone, þat was hym lyche: Off wytte and power lyke hym he was, Like þe fader in all case. That þe fader wyst þe son thou?t, All thorow þe sone þe fader wrou?t; What þe fader wold haue wrou?t, The sone it dyde, for he knew his thought; In his kyndom all nedys Wer fullfylled thorow hys dedys. Foure dou?teres had þe kyng, And euerych of þem had somethyng Off hys wyte and hys powere, Iche-one as þei had myster, And neuerþeles all was þe kyngys, The iiij dou?tures wiþ all þer thyngys, For wiþouten þem euery dele My?ht he not reule hys kyngdom wele. Feyre names þei had euerychon, I schall þem telle ry?ht anone: The fyrst dou?ter hyght Mersy; That is a feyre name sykerly; The secund douter hyght Sothnes, And þe thyrd Ryghtfullnes; The iiij dou?ter hyght Pese— Feyr names wiþouten lese. Wiþoute þe foure þat I named May no thing ryght be demed. Thys ryche kyng had a man Thorow whom mych wrech began, And hym louyd wele þe kyng And made hym mayster of mych thyng. Bot a comandment he hym toke And seyd when he þat forsoke, He schuld to turment, vnderstond this, Oute of hys courte, and all hys. Thys seruant ?ede forth wiþ þat, Hys commandment sone he brake. Iugement on hym was leyd After þat þe kyng had seyd; To iiij turmentowres he was take, Hys iugement on hym to make. The turmentowres, as bad þe kyng, They schuld hym do an euyll dubyng: The one schuld hym depriuen faste, The oþer hym [f]le whyll hys lyfe laste, The oþer hym strangyll ryght also, The oþer hym fetyr, so dyde þei tho. Mercy, þe dou?ter, all þis [s]ey and herd How he was in prison sperd. To hyr fader sche com anone And askyd hym what for to done: “Thy dou?ter, fader, þou wote I ame, Mersy I hyght, of þe I camme, Off þi ?ifte I vnderstode, To haue mersy wiþ myld mode. Therfor, fader, I pray þe here That þou herkyn my prayere: Haue mersy of þat ilke wyght That in prison is euyll dyght! Hys enmyse dyd to hym trespas, Fader, of hym haue mersy and grace! Hys enmyse for envye They dude hym þat trecherye. Do now, fader, þat I craue, ?iff þou wyll me þi dou?ter haue! Mersy I ame; yff þou wyll me, Thou must haue mersy and pyte. Wiþ gode skyll he muste be sauyd, For I, þe dou?ter, haue þe crauyd. For hym mersy schall be my crye, Whyll þat I may fynd mersy.” Misericordia et Veritas obviaverunt sibi. Sothnes, hyr syster, þis pleynt herd, Sone sche com and ansuerd: “Fader, what may þis pleynt be That Mersy, my syster, makys to þe? Wold sche for hyr myld herte Bryng þis prisoner owte of smerte? Scho wold he wer fro peyn ibrou?ht, Bot I, Sothnes, wyll it nou?ht. A trew thyng, fader, I tell þe: ?iff all thyng my?ht sauyd be For whom my syster wyll praye, Schall non of þe stand aye. I ame Sothnes, herkens to me, And þat name I hade of þe! Men callys me kyng in euery kythe, And ?iff sothnes wones þe wyth, Mersy of hym may þou haue none, Bot I, Sothnes, fro þe gone. Pyte off hym may non be wroght, For hymselue wyll it nou?ht. Kyng off sothnes, do than ryght And late avenge þe of þat wyght!” The syster Ryght þeder gan gone; Thys wordys sche herd euerychone. When sche þe pleynte onderstode, Sche ansuerd wiþ myld mode: “Fader, my name is callyd Ryght, That name I hade of thy myght. Seth I ame Ryght, and þou hast me, As Soth it seys, it muste be, For Ryght wyll in non wyse That seruant wer in unyse. That Soth hath seyd, I, Ry?ht, it wyll, For it is reson and skyll. Late þou hym in priso[n] be, Tyll þou hym iuge befor þe! For Ryght wyll haue all onderhond, That he, Soth, do onderstond; Ryght gyffes iche man be Sothe his rede, Be it to gode, be it to quede. Whyll þat he thyn hest held, We wer wiþ hym wiþ spere and scheld, Both Mersy, Soth, and Ryght, And Pese, my syster, wiþ all oure my?t. Vs all iiij he hath forsake, Right wyll þerfor vengeans take.” Non god word was þer speke, When þat Mersy was oute steke. Than was þat wrech wiþ peynes schent, Hys god benom, hys clothes rente; In peyn was he manyfolde, As Soth and Ryght bothe it wolde. And also þat of hym com, All þei had þe same dome. Soth and Ryght wiþouten les Went wiþout Mersy and Pes, And be contre as þei wend, All þat wreches kynd þei schent; So fast þei gan þem doun dryue That þei left neuer one of lyue. A flode ouer all dyd go; viij þat left of lyue and nomo: That was Noe and his thre sones— Ther wer no mo left in no wonys— In Noys schype wiþ þer wyues, Wherin þei sauyd þer lyues. That was þan a reufull syght, And ?it it was bote soth and ry?ht. The syster Pes my?ht nowher be, Sche was sent out contre, For sche may for no thyng Be among wreth and werryng. Than was Pes in mych care, When sche saw þe werld þus fare. To hyr fader hyr wey sche leyd, And com to hym sone and seyd: “Fader, I ame þi dou?ter Pes, I au?ht be at thy dese. Thou arte kynge of pes so dere: My fader, þan must þou here! My two systeres, Soth and Ryght, Wiþ Pes and Mersy þei hold fyght; All wiþout oure asente They don all þer iugement.

All godnes thorow pes to end is brou?t; Whoso hath pes, he feylys nou?ht; Wiþouten pes is wro?ht no thyng, Be it neuer so grete doyng. Whoso euer aboute wyll wend, Pese schall folow at þe ende. Soth and Ryght it is þer fe For to kepe þe name of me, For þei haue non oþer nede Bot pes to kepe in euery lede. Why schall I than be forsake, When þou pes for me gan take? Bot I haue Mersy, my syster, wiþ me: I may not els sauyd be. Seth þou arte kyng of pes in lond, My word aw to be vnderstond. Off þe foure systeres a resyn clere Now ry?ht wyll I schew here: Thorow vs iiij schall all be wrou?t, In vnyte is all my thou?t; All we iiij verament Schall make one iugement.

Mersy, my syster, cryes euermo Mersy for hym þat is in wo; Therfor I, Pes, at þe endes Schall fond to make þe frendes.” The kyngys son both wyse and queynt Herd þe iiij systeres pleynt. Wiþouten hym on non wyse Acord may not ry?ht aryse. “Fader,” he seyd, “thyn I ame; Off þe, fader, fyrst I com.

Be þis foure wiþoutyn les Governd was hys land, For no land mey be at hys right Keped wiþoutyn þis foure I plyght, Als I vnderstand. 7 Þis kyng had wiþ hym a man Þat he mykell avaunce gan, And made hym of gret myght, And he betaught hym a gret land Tyll haue and holde in hys hand, To be hys trewe knyght. 8 Þis kyng thoght for to proven If his seruaunt wold hym loven, And seyd tyll hym full sone: “Now I haue þe b[r]oght aboue, Do swylk a dede for my loue Þat lyght is for to done.” 9 “And if þou kepe þis byddyng, I schall þe make a rych kyng, Iwys abouen all other, Þe and all þine ofspryng, To be wiþ me in all thyng And loue þ[e] als my brother.” 10 “And if þou breke þis comaundment, Þou schalt thoroght ryght iuggement Dey for þi dede; Þou and all þine ofspryng Wiþoutyn ende haue ?our duellyng In strong prison to mede.” 11 Als tyte þe seruaunt for gret pryde Left hys comaundment þat tyde, And for hym wold noght don, Als swyth þat proude seruaunt men nomen, And all hys ofspryng þat of hym comen, And cast þem in herd prison, 12 Am[on]g þeir enmys fo[r] to duell, For þei wer lefe hym to quell, Full wykked þei ar kyd. Þat on turmentour hym slowgh, Þat other hys flessh and bonys knogh, And straungled hym þe third. 13 Þe ferth gan hym swalough ine. Þus he was pyned and hys kynne Ay wiþoutyn ende, For he þat comaundment so sone brak, Was none a gode worde for hym spak Tyll hys lord þe kyng. 14 Þe kynges doughter þat hyght Mercy, Of þis seruaunt scho gan to spy, In prison how he was. Sche saw what pyne he tholed and wo; Hir clothes sche rafe, hir her also, And seyd: “Allas, allas!” 15 “Þat euer schuld any man se In þis payne and wo be For any maner dede!” To hir fadir is sche lopen, To haue mercy is hir hopen Of þat man in nede. 16 “Fadir,” sche seyde, “þi doughter am I, Of þi substaunce, and heyght Mercy, And merciable art þou. And if þou be noght mercyable, Þan wer it noght bot a fable To be þi doughter nowe.” 17 “And if I, Mercy, þi doughter be, Þan owe þou to haue mercy and pite Of ?one man þat I craue; Ne schall I blynne nyght ne day Þat I ne schall for hym wepen ay Till þat þou mercy haue.” 18 Þat oþer doughter Verite Seyd: “Fadir, wiþoutyn me Schuld þou do ryght noght, Ne owe þou noght till her Mercy Bot if Verite be hir by In dede, worde, and thoght.” 19 “Sothnes, þi doughter I am, And soth it is þat þat man Ageyn þe wrought in dede, Whan he brak þi byddyng Of þat ilk litill thyng Þat þou hym forbede.” 20 “How schuld þou haue on hym mercy Þat dyd þe þat vyleny? Wele þou wote þe soth, And Sothnes, þi doughter am I. How myght þou þan serue Mercy For to pay vs both?” 21 Whiles þei strofe on þis wyse, Come þe third doughter Iustise And seyde þis ilk word: “And I am þi doughter Iustis, Wiþoutyn me schuld none assys Be holden in þi cour[t].” 22 “Ryghtwys of þe I am forth broght; Wiþoutyn Ryghtwys schuld þou do noght Bot it wer in present. Son he did þat þou hym forbed, And was demed to haue þe ded; He ow to haue his iuggement.” 23 “Ryght it is þat he hawe Þat hym was iugged wiþ right and lawe And wiþ gode witnes. Bot if þou do skill and right, []e to þi doughter has þou no myght Þat am þi rightwysnes.” 24 “Soth it was he dyd foly, Right it is þat he it aby Thoroght þat dede to dy. If Mercy myght hir askyng haue, Þem þat sche wild go to saue, Full fo men schuld aby.” 25 “No man schuld stand aw for þe, Ageyns þi byddyng for to be, Nouþer in word ne dede. Þei schuld to mykill troist þeron Þat Mercy schuld þem saue ilkon; Of no thyng schuld þei drede.” 26 Þe ferth doughter hyght Pesse; Among þem myght sche haue no cesse, Awey ned hir bud fle, For þer contak is and strife And þer metyng is all riffe, Þer mey Pese noght be. 27 So long wrought þe kyng of myght, Be Sothnes and als be Right, Vengeaunce for to tak, Þat all þis werld was fordone, Saue viij soules all a[l]one, For þat seruaunt sake. 28 Þat was Noe and his sones thre And þeir wyfes; no more meyne On lyfe wer no mo. And euer Mercy besought þe kyng For þat seruaunt and his ofspryng To bryng þem of þeir wo. 29 Þan come Pese þidir ageyne To hyr fadir and gane to seyne: “Fadir der, I pray þe! Forth be my sisters in erth went To make þer all þeir iuggement Wiþoutyn councell of me.” 30 “Nouþer Verite ne Iustis No schuld wirk on no wys Ought wiþoutyn my rede, For all þei schuld do þeir meystry. Pese in lande Right schuld gy, For þerto wer all nede.” 31 “Bot Pese mey be for no thyng Bot if Mercy haue hir askyng Of þat man þat is lorne. Fadir, fro þe I will noght gone Till my sisters be all at one And stand me beforne.” 32 Sone þe son come þidir þan To his fadir and spake for man: “Fadir, lysten to me: Both þou and I, one we be In power and in dignite, And þe wisdome am I of þe.”</field>
