      <field name="fulltext">THE ANGEL IN THE HOUSE “Par le grace infinie, Dieu les mist au monde ensemble.” Rousier des Dames. BOOK I THE PROLOGUE 1 Mine is no horse with wings, to gain ‘The region of the spheral chime; ‘He does but drag a rumbling wain, ‘Cheer'd by the coupled bells of rhyme; ‘And if at Fame's bewitching note ‘My homely Pegasus pricks an ear, ‘The world's cart-collar hugs his throat, ‘And he's too sage to kick or rear.’ 2 Thus ever answer'd Vaughan his Wife, Who, more than he, desired his fame; But, in his heart, his thoughts were rife How for her sake to earn a name. With bays poetic three times crown'd, And other college honours won, He, if he chose, might be renown'd, He had but little doubt, she none; And in a loftier phrase he talk'd With her, upon their Wedding-Day, (The eighth), while through the fields they walk'd, Their children shouting by the way. 3 ‘Not careless of the gift of song, ‘Nor out of love with noble fame, ‘I, meditating much and long ‘What I should sing, how win a name, ‘Considering well what theme unsung, ‘What reason worth the cost of rhyme, ‘Remains to loose the poet's tongue ‘In these last days, the dregs of time, ‘Learn that to me, though born so late, ‘There does, beyond desert, befall ‘(May my great fortune make me great!) ‘The first of themes, sung last of all. ‘In green and undiscover'd ground, ‘Yet near where many others sing, ‘I have the very well-head found ‘Whence gushes the Pierian Spring.’ 4 Then she: ‘What is it, Dear? The Life ‘Of Arthur, or Jerusalem's Fall?’ ‘Neither: your gentle self, my Wife, ‘And love, that grows from one to all. ‘And if I faithfully proclaim ‘Of these the exceeding worthiness, ‘Surely the sweetest wreath of Fame ‘Shall, to your hope, my brows caress; ‘And if, by virtue of my choice ‘Of this, the most heart-touching theme ‘That ever tuned a poet's voice, ‘I live, as I am bold to dream, ‘To be delight to many days, ‘And into silence only cease ‘When those are still, who shared their bays ‘With Laura and with Beatrice, ‘Imagine, Love, how learned men ‘Will deep-conceiv'd devices find, ‘Beyond my purpose and my ken, ‘An ancient bard of simple mind. ‘You, Sweet, his Mistress, Wife, and Muse, ‘Were you for mortal woman meant? Your praises give a hundred clues ‘To mythological intent! And, severing thus the truth from trope, ‘In you the Commentators see ‘Outlines occult of abstract scope, ‘A future for philosophy! ‘Your arm's on mine! these are the meads ‘In which we pass our living days; ‘There Avon runs, now hid with reeds, ‘Now brightly brimming pebbly bays; ‘Those are our children's songs that come ‘With bells and bleatings of the sheep; ‘And there, in yonder English home, ‘We thrive on mortal food and sleep!’ She laugh'd. How proud she always was To feel how proud he was of her! But he had grown distraught, because The Muse's mood began to stir. 5 His purpose with performance crown'd, He to his well-pleased Wife rehears'd, When next their Wedding-Day came round, His leisure's labour, ‘Book the First.’ CANTO I The Cathedral Close PRELUDES I The Impossibility Lo, Love's obey'd by all. 'Tis right That all should know what they obey, Lest erring conscience damp delight, And folly laugh our joys away. Thou Primal Love, who grantest wings And voices to the woodland birds, Grant me the power of saying things Too simple and too sweet for words! II Love's Reality I walk, I trust, with open eyes; I've travell'd half my worldly course; And in the way behind me lies Much vanity and some remorse; I've lived to feel how pride may part Spirits, tho' match'd like hand and glove; I've blush'd for love's abode, the heart; But have not disbelieved in love; Nor unto love, sole mortal thing Of worth immortal, done the wrong To count it, with the rest that sing, Unworthy of a serious song; And love is my reward; for now, When most of dead'ning time complain, The myrtle blooms upon my brow, Its odour quickens all my brain. III The Poet's Confidence The richest realm of all the earth Is counted still a heathen land: Lo, I, like Joshua, now go forth To give it into Israel's hand. I will not hearken blame or praise; For so should I dishonour do To that sweet Power by which these Lays Alone are lovely, good, and true; Nor credence to the world's cries give, Which ever preach and still prevent Pure passion's high prerogative To make, not follow, precedent. From love's abysmal ether rare If I to men have here made known New truths, they, like new stars, were there Before, though not yet written down. Moving but as the feelings move, I run, or loiter with delight, Or pause to mark where gentle Love Persuades the soul from height to height, Yet, know ye, though my words are gay As David's dance, which Michal scorn'd, If kindly you receive the Lay, You shall be sweetly help'd and warn'd. THE CATHEDRAL CLOSE I Once more I came to Sarum Close, With joy half memory, half desire, And breathed the sunny wind that rose And blew the shadows o'er the Spire, And toss'd the lilac's scented plumes, And sway'd the chestnut's thousand cones, And fill'd my nostrils with perfumes, And shaped the clouds in waifs and zones, And wafted down the serious strain Of Sarum bells, when, true to time, I reach'd the Dean's, with heart and brain That trembled to the trembling chime. 2 'Twas half my home, six years ago. The six years had not alter'd it: Red-brick and ashlar, long and low, With dormers and with oriels lit. Geranium, lychnis, rose array'd The windows, all wide open thrown; And some one in the Study play'd The Wedding-March of Mendelssohn. And there it was I last took leave: 'Twas Christmas: I remember'd now The cruel girls, who feign'd to grieve, Took down the evergreens; and how The holly into blazes woke The fire, lighting the large, low room A dim, rich lustre of old oak And crimson velvet's glowing gloom. 3 No change had touch'd Dean Churchill: kind, By widowhood more than winters bent, And settled in a cheerful mind, As still forecasting heaven's content. Well might his thoughts be fix'd on high, Now she was there! Within her face Humility and dignity Were met in a most sweet embrace. She seem'd expressly sent below To teach our erring minds to see The rhythmic change of time's swift flow As part of still eternity. Her life, all honour, observed, with awe Which cross experience could not mar, The fiction of the Christian law That all men honourable are; And so her smile at once conferr'd High flattery and benign reproof; And I, a rude boy, strangely stirr'd, Grew courtly in my own behoof. The years, so far from doing her wrong, Anointed her with gracious balm, And made her brows more and more young With wreaths of amaranth and palm. 4 Was this her eldest, Honor; prude, Who would not let me pull the swing; Who, kiss'd at Christmas, call'd me rude, And, sobbing low, refused to sing? How changed! In shape no slender Grace, But Venus; milder than the dove; Her mother's air; her Norman face; Her large sweet eyes, clear lakes of love. Mary I knew. In former time Ailing and pale, she thought that bliss Was only for a better clime, And, heavenly overmuch, scorn'd this. I, rash with theories of the right, Which stretch'd the tether of my Creed, But did not break it, held delight Half discipline. We disagreed. She told the Dean I wanted grace. Now she was kindest of the three, And soft wild roses deck'd her face. And, what, was this my Mildred, she To herself and all a sweet surprise? My Pet, who romp'd and roll'd a hoop? I wonder'd where those daisy eyes Had found their touching curve and droop. 5 Unmannerly times! But now we sat Stranger than strangers; till I caught And answer'd Mildred's smile; and that Spread to the rest, and freedom brought. The Dean talk'd little, looking on, Of three such daughters justly vain. What letters they had had from Bonn, Said Mildred, and what plums from Spain! By Honor I was kindly task'd To excuse my never coming down From Cambridge; Mary smiled and ask'd Were Kant and Goethe yet outgrown? And, pleased, we talk'd the old days o'er; And, parting, I for pleasure sigh'd. To be there as a friend, (since more), Seem'd then, seems still, excuse for pride; For something that abode endued With temple-like repose, an air Of life's kind purposes pursued With order'd freedom sweet and fair. A tent pitch'd in a world not right It seem'd, whose inmates, every one, On tranquil faces bore the light Of duties beautifully done, And humbly, though they had few peers, Kept their own laws, which seem'd to be The fair sum of six thousand years' Traditions of civility. CANTO II Mary and Mildred PRELUDES I The Paragon When I behold the skies aloft Passing the pageantry of dreams, The cloud whose bosom, cygnet-soft, A couch for nuptial Juno seems, The ocean broad, the mountains bright, The shadowy vales with feeding herds, I from my lyre the music smite, Nor want for justly matching words. All forces of the sea and air, All interests of hill and plain, I so can sing, in seasons fair, That who hath felt may feel again. Elated oft by such free songs, I think with utterance free to raise That hymn for which the whole world longs, A worthy hymn in woman's praise; A hymn bright-noted like a bird's, Arousing these song-sleepy times With rhapsodies of perfect words, Ruled by returning kiss of rhymes. But when I look on her and hope To tell with joy what I admire, My thoughts lie cramp'd in narrow scope, Or in the feeble birth expire; No mystery of well-woven speech, No simplest phrase of tenderest fall, No liken'd excellence can reach Her, the most excellent of all, The best half of creation's best, Its heart to feel, its eye to see, The crown and complex of the rest, Its aim and its epitome. Nay, might I utter my conceit, 'Twere after all a vulgar song, For she's so simply, subtly sweet, My deepest rapture does her wrong. Yet is it now my chosen task To sing her worth as Maid and Wife; Nor happier post than this I ask, To live her laureate all my life. On wings of love uplifted free, And by her gentleness made great, I'll teach how noble man should be To match with such a lovely mate; And then in her may move the more The woman's wish to be desired, (By praise increased), till both shall soar, With blissful emulations fired. And, as geranium, pink, or rose Is thrice itself through power of art, So may my happy skill disclose New fairness even in her fair heart; Until that churl shall nowhere be Who bends not, awed, before the throne Of her affecting majesty, So meek, so far unlike our own; Until (for who may hope too much From her who wields the powers of love?) Our lifted lives at last shall touch That happy goal to which they move; Until we find, as darkness rolls Away, and evil mists dissolve, The nuptial contrasts are the poles On which the heavenly spheres revolve. II Love at Large Whene'er I come where ladies are, How sad soever I was before, Though like a ship frost-bound and far Withheld in ice from the ocean's roar, Third-winter'd in that dreadful dock, With stiffen'd cordage, sails decay'd, And crew that care for calm and shock Alike, too dull to be dismay'd, Yet, if I come where ladies are, How sad soever I was before, Then is my sadness banish'd far, And I am like that ship no more; Or like that ship if the ice-field splits, Burst by the sudden polar Spring, And all thank God with their warming wits, And kiss each other and dance and sing, And hoist fresh sails, that make the breeze Blow them along the liquid sea, Out of the North, where life did freeze, Into the haven where they would be. III Love and Duty Anne lived so truly from above, She was so gentle and so good, That duty bade me fall in love, And ‘but for that,’ thought I, ‘I should!’ I worshipp'd Kate with all my will. In idle moods you seem to see A noble spirit in a hill, A human touch about a tree. IV A Distinction The lack of lovely pride, in her Who strives to please, my pleasure numbs, And still the maid I most prefer Whose care to please with pleasing comes. MARY AND MILDRED 1 One morning, after Church, I walk'd Alone with Mary on the lawn, And felt myself, howe'er we talk'd, To grave themes delicately drawn. When she delighted, found I knew More of her peace than she supposed, Our confidences heavenwards grew, Like fox-glove buds, in pairs disclosed. Our former faults did we confess, Our ancient feud was more than heal'd. And, with the woman's eagerness For amity full-sign'd and seal'd, She, offering up for sacrifice Her heart's reserve, brought out to show Some verses, made when she was ice To all but Heaven, six years ago; Since happier grown! I took and read The neat-writ lines. She, void of guile, Too late repenting, blush'd, and said, I must not think about the style. 2 ‘Day after day, until to-day, ‘Imaged the others gone before, ‘The same dull task, the weary way, ‘The weakness pardon'd o'er and o'er, ‘The thwarted thirst, too faintly felt, ‘For joy's well-nigh forgotten life, ‘The restless heart, which, when I knelt, ‘Made of my worship barren strife. ‘Ah, whence to-day's so sweet release, ‘This clearance light of all my care, ‘This conscience free, this fertile peace, ‘These softly folded wings of prayer, ‘This calm and more than conquering love, ‘With which nought evil dares to cope, ‘This joy that lifts no glance above, ‘For faith too sure, too sweet for hope? ‘O, happy time, too happy change, ‘It will not live, though fondly nurst! ‘Full soon the sun will seem as strange ‘As now the cloud which seems dispersed.’ 3 She from a rose-tree shook the blight; And well she knew that I knew well Her grace with silence to requite; And, answering now the luncheon-bell, I laugh'd at Mildred's laugh, which made All melancholy wrong, its mood Such sweet self-confidence display'd, So glad a sense of present good. 4 I laugh'd and sigh'd; for I confess I never went to Ball, or Fête, Or Show, but in pursuit express Of my predestinated mate; And thus to me, who had in sight The happy chance upon the cards, Each beauty blossom'd in the light Of tender personal regards; And, in the records of my breast, Red-letter'd, eminently fair, Stood sixteen, who, beyond the rest, By turns till then had been my care: At Berlin three, one at St. Cloud, At Chatteris, near Cambridge, one, At Ely four, in London two, Two at Bowness, in Paris none, And, last and best, in Sarum three; But dearest of the whole fair troop, In judgment of the moment, she Whose daisy eyes had learn'd to droop Her very faults my fancy fired; My loving will, so thwarted, grew; And, bent on worship, I admired Whate'er she was, with partial view. And yet when, as to-day, her smile Was prettiest, I could not but note Honoria, less admired the while, Was lovelier, though from love remote. CANTO III Honoria PRELUDES I The Lover He meets, by heavenly chance express, The destined maid; some hidden hand Unveils to him that loveliness Which others cannot understand. His merits in her presence grow, To match the promise in her eyes, And round her happy footsteps blow The authentic airs of Paradise. For joy of her he cannot sleep; Her beauty haunts him all the night; It melts his heart, it makes him weep For wonder, worship, and delight. O, paradox of love, he longs, Most humble when he most aspires, To suffer scorn and cruel wrongs From her he honours and desires. Her graces make him rich, and ask No guerdon; this imperial style Affronts him; he disdains to bask, The pensioner of her priceless smile. He prays for some hard thing to do, Some work of fame and labour immense, To stretch the languid bulk and thew Of love's fresh-born magnipotence. No smallest boon were bought too dear, Though barter'd for his love-sick life; Yet trusts he, with undaunted cheer, To vanquish heaven, and call her Wife. He notes how queens of sweetness still Neglect their crowns, and stoop to mate; How, self-consign'd with lavish will, They ask but love proportionate; How swift pursuit by small degrees, Love's tactic, works like miracle; How valour, clothed in courtesies, Brings down the haughtiest citadel; And therefore, though he merits not To kiss the braid upon her skirt, His hope, discouraged ne'er a jot, Out-soars all possible desert. II Love a Virtue Strong passions mean weak will, and he Who truly knows the strength and bliss Which are in love, will own with me No passion but a virtue 'tis. Few hear my word; it soars above The subtlest senses of the swarm Of wretched things which know not love, Their Psyche still a wingless worm. Ice-cold seems heaven's noble glow To spirits whose vital heat is hell; And to corrupt hearts even so The songs I sing, the tale I tell. These cannot see the robes of white In which I sing of love. Alack, But darkness shows in heavenly light, Though whiteness, in the dark, is black! III Unthrift Ah, wasteful woman, she who may On her sweet self set her own price, Knowing man cannot choose but pay, How has she cheapen'd paradise; How given for nought her priceless gift, How spoil'd the bread and spill'd the wine, Which, spent with due, respective thrift, Had made brutes men, and men divine. IV The Attainment You love? That's high as you shall go; For 'tis as true as Gospel text, Not noble then is never so, Either in this world or the next. HONORIA 1 Grown weary with a week's exile From those fair friends, I rode to see The church-restorings; lounged awhile, And met the Dean; was ask'd to tea, And found their cousin, Frederick Graham, At Honor's side. Was I concern'd, If, when she sang, his colour came, That mine, as with a buffet, burn'd? A man to please a girl! thought I, Retorting his forced smiles, the shrouds Of wrath, so hid as she was by, Sweet moon between her lighted clouds! 2 Whether this Cousin was the cause I know not, but I seem'd to see, The first time then, how fair she was, How much the fairest of the three. Each stopp'd to let the other go; But, time-bound, he arose the first. Stay'd he in Sarum long? If so I hoped to see him at the Hurst. No: he had call'd here, on his way To Portsmouth, where the ‘Arrogant,’ His ship, was; he should leave next day, For two years' cruise in the Levant. 3 Had love in her yet struck its germs? I watch'd. Her farewell show'd me plain She loved, on the majestic terms That she should not be loved again. And so her cousin, parting, felt. Hope in his voice and eye was dead. Compassion did my malice melt; Then went I home to a restless bed. I, who admired her too, could see His infinite remorse at this Great mystery, that she should be So beautiful, yet not be his, And, pitying, long'd to plead his part; But scarce could tell, so strange my whim, Whether the weight upon my heart Was sorrow for myself or him. 4 She was all mildness; yet 'twas writ In all her grace, most legibly, ‘He that's for heaven itself unfit, ‘Let him not hope to merit me.’ And such a challenge, quite apart From thoughts of love, humbled, and thus To sweet repentance moved my heart, And made me more magnanimous, And led me to review my life, Inquiring where in aught the least, If question were of her for wife, Ill might be mended, hope increas'd. Not that I soar'd so far above Myself, as this great hope to dare; And yet I well foresaw that love Might hope where reason must despair; And, half-resenting the sweet pride Which would not ask me to admire, ‘Oh,’ to my secret heart I sigh'd, ‘That I were worthy to desire!’ 5 As drowsiness my brain reliev'd, A shrill defiance of all to arms, Shriek'd by the stable-cock, receiv'd An angry answer from three farms. And, then, I dream'd that I, her knight, A clarion's haughty pathos heard, And rode securely to the fight, Cased in the scarf she had conferr'd; And there, the bristling lists behind, Saw many, and vanquish'd all I saw Of her unnumber'd cousin-kind, In Navy, Army, Church, and Law; Smitten, the warriors somehow turn'd To Sarum choristers, whose song, Mix'd with celestial sorrow, yearn'd With joy no memory can prolong; And phantasms as absurd and sweet Merged each in each in endless chace, And everywhere I seem'd to meet The haunting fairness of her face. CANTO IV The Morning Call PRELUDES I The Rose of the World Lo, when the Lord made North and South And sun and moon ordained, He, Forthbringing each by word of mouth In order of its dignity, Did man from the crude clay express By sequence, and, all else decreed, He form'd the woman; nor might less Than Sabbath such a work succeed. And still with favour singled out, Marr'd less than man by mortal fall, Her disposition is devout, Her countenance angelical; The best things that the best believe Are in her face so kindly writ The faithless, seeing her, conceive Not only heaven, but hope of it; No idle thought her instinct shrouds, But fancy chequers settled sense, Like alteration of the clouds On noonday's azure permanence; Pure dignity, composure, ease Declare affections nobly fix'd, And impulse sprung from due degrees Of sense and spirit sweetly mix'd. Her modesty, her chiefest grace, The cestus clasping Venus' side, How potent to deject the face Of him who would affront its pride! Wrong dares not in her presence speak, Nor spotted thought its taint disclose Under the protest of a cheek Outbragging Nature's boast the rose. In mind and manners how discreet; How artless in her very art; How candid in discourse; how sweet The concord of her lips and heart; How simple and how circumspect; How subtle and how fancy-free; Though sacred to her love, how deck'd With unexclusive courtesy; How quick in talk to see from far The way to vanquish or evade; How able her persuasions are To prove, her reasons to persuade; How (not to call true instinct's bent And woman's very nature, harm), How amiable and innocent Her pleasure in her power to charm; How humbly careful to attract, Though crown'd with all the soul desires, Connubial aptitude exact, Diversity that never tires. II The Tribute Boon Nature to the woman bows; She walks in earth's whole glory clad, And, chiefest far herself of shows, All others help her, and are glad: No splendour 'neath the sky's proud dome But serves for her familiar wear; The far-fetch'd diamond finds its home Flashing and smouldering in her hair; For her the seas their pearls reveal; Art and strange lands her pomp supply With purple, chrome, and cochineal, Ochre, and lapis lazuli; The worm its golden woof presents; Whatever runs, flies, dives, or delves, All doff for her their ornaments, Which suit her better than themselves; And all, by this their power to give, Proving her right to take, proclaim Her beauty's clear prerogative To profit so by Eden's blame. III Compensation That nothing here may want its praise, Know, she who in her dress reveals A fine and modest taste, displays More loveliness than she conceals. THE MORNING CALL 1 ‘By meekness charm'd, or proud to allow ‘A queenly claim to live admired, ‘Full many a lady has ere now ‘My apprehensive fancy fired, ‘And woven many a transient chain; ‘But never lady like to this, ‘Who holds me as the weather-vane ‘Is held by yonder clematis. ‘She seems the life of nature's powers; ‘Her beauty is the genial thought ‘Which makes the sunshine bright; the flowers, ‘But for their hint of her, were nought.’ 2 A voice, the sweeter for the grace Of suddenness, while thus I dream'd, ‘Good morning!’ said or sang. Her face The mirror of the morning seem'd. Her sisters in the garden walk'd, And would I come? Across the Hall She led me; and we laugh'd and talk'd, And praised the Flower-show and the Ball; And Mildred's pinks had gain'd the Prize; And, stepping like the light-foot fawn, She brought me ‘Wiltshire Butterflies,’ The Prize-book; then we paced the lawn, Close-cut, and with geranium-plots, A rival glow of green and red; Then counted sixty apricots On one small tree; the gold-fish fed; And watch'd where, black with scarlet tans, Proud Psyche stood and flash'd like flame, Showing and shutting splendid fans; And in the prize we found its name. 3 The sweet hour lapsed, and left my breast A load of joy and tender care; And this delight, which life oppress'd, To fix'd aims grew, that ask'd for pray'r. I rode home slowly; whip-in-hand And soil'd bank-notes all ready, stood The Farmer who farm'd all my land, Except the little Park and Wood; And, with the accustom'd compliment Of talk, and beef, and frothing beer, I, my own steward, took my rent, Three hundred pounds for half the year; Our witnesses the Cook and Groom, We sign'd the lease for seven years more, And bade Good-day; then to my room I went, and closed and lock'd the door, And cast myself down on my bed, And there, with many a blissful tear, I vow'd to love and pray'd to wed The maiden who had grown so dear; Thank'd God who had set her in my path; And promised, as I hoped to win, That I would never dim my faith By the least selfishness or sin; Whatever in her sight I'd seem I'd truly be; I'd never blend With my delight in her a dream 'Twould change her cheek to comprehend; And, if she wish'd it, I'd prefer Another's to my own success; And always seek the best for her, With unofficious tenderness. 4 Rising, I breathed a brighter clime, And found myself all self above, And, with a charity sublime, Contemn'd not those who did not love; And I could not but feel that then I shone with something of her grace, And went forth to my fellow men My commendation in my face. CANTO V The Uiolets PRELUDES I The Comparison Where she succeeds with cloudless brow, In common and in holy course, He fails, in spite of prayer and vow And agonies of faith and force; Or, if his suit with Heaven prevails To righteous life, his virtuous deeds Lack beauty, virtue's badge; she fails More graciously than he succeeds. Her spirit, compact of gentleness, If Heaven postpones or grants her pray'r, Conceives no pride in its success, And in its failure no despair; But his, enamour'd of its hurt, Baffled, blasphemes, or, not denied, Crows from the dunghill of desert, And wags its ugly wings for pride. He's never young nor ripe; she grows More infantine, auroral, mild, And still the more she lives and knows The lovelier she's express'd a child. Say that she wants the will of man To conquer fame, not check'd by cross, Nor moved when others bless or ban; She wants but what to have were loss. Or say she wants the patient brain To track shy truth; her facile wit At that which he hunts down with pain Flies straight, and does exactly hit. Were she but half of what she is, He twice himself, mere love alone, Her special crown, as truth is his, Gives title to the worthier throne; For love is substance, truth the form; Truth without love were less than nought; But blindest love is sweet and warm, And full of truth not shaped by thought; And therefore in herself she stands Adorn'd with undeficient grace, Her happy virtues taking hands, Each smiling in another's face. So, dancing round the Tree of Life, They make an Eden in her breast, While his, disjointed and at strife, Proud-thoughted, do not bring him rest. II Love in Tears If fate Love's dear ambition mar, And load his breast with hopeless pain, And seem to blot out sun and star, Love, won or lost, is countless gain; His sorrow boasts a secret bliss Which sorrow of itself beguiles, And Love in tears too noble is For pity, save of Love in smiles. But, looking backward through his tears, With vision of maturer scope, How often one dead joy appears The platform of some better hope! And, let us own, the sharpest smart Which human patience may endure Pays light for that which leaves the heart More generous, dignified, and pure. III Prospective Faith They safely walk in darkest ways Whose youth is lighted from above, Where, through the senses' silvery haze, Dawns the veil'd moon of nuptial love. Who is the happy husband? He Who, scanning his unwedded life, Thanks Heaven, with a conscience free, 'Twas faithful to his future wife. IV Venus Victrix Fatal in force, yet gentle in will, Defeats, from her, are tender pacts, For, like the kindly lodestone, still She's drawn herself by what she attracts. THE VIOLETS 1 I went not to the Dean's unbid: I would not have my mystery, From her so delicately hid, The guess of gossips at their tea. A long, long week, and not once there, Had made my spirit sick and faint, And lack-love, foul as love is fair, Perverted all things to complaint. How vain the world had grown to be! How mean all people and their ways, How ignorant their sympathy, And how impertinent their praise; What they for virtuousness esteem'd, How far removed from heavenly right; What pettiness their trouble seem'd, How undelightful their delight; To my necessity how strange The sunshine and the song of birds; How dull the clouds' continual change, How foolishly content the herds; How unaccountable the law Which bade me sit in blindness here, While she, the sun by which I saw, Shed splendour in an idle sphere! And then I kiss'd her stolen glove, And sigh'd to reckon and define The modes of martyrdom in love, And how far each one might be mine. I thought how love, whose vast estate Is earth and air and sun and sea, Encounters oft the beggar's fate, Despised on score of poverty; How Heaven, inscrutable in this, Lets the gross general make or mar The destiny of love, which is So tender and particular; How nature, as unnatural And contradicting nature's source, Which is but love, seems most of all Well-pleased to harry true love's course; How, many times, it comes to pass That trifling shades of temperament, Affecting only one, alas, Not love, but love's success prevent; How manners often falsely paint The man; how passionate respect, Hid by itself, may bear the taint Of coldness and a dull neglect; And how a little outward dust Can a clear merit quite o'ercloud, And make her fatally unjust, And him desire a darker shroud; How senseless opportunity Gives baser men the better chance; How powers, adverse else, agree To cheat her in her ignorance; How Heaven its very self conspires With man and nature against love, As pleased to couple cross desires, And cross where they themselves approve. Wretched were life, if the end were now! But this gives tears to dry despair, Faith shall be blest, we know not how, And love fulfilled, we know not where. 2 While thus I grieved, and kiss'd her glove, My man brought in her note to say, Papa had bid her send his love, And would I dine with them next day? They had learn'd and practised Purcell's glee, To sing it by to-morrow night. The Postscript was: Her sisters and she Inclosed some violets, blue and white; She and her sisters found them where I wager'd once no violets grew; So they had won the gloves. And there The violets lay, two white, one blue. CANTO VI The Dean PRELUDES I Perfect Love rare Most rare is still most noble found, Most noble still most incomplete; Sad law, which leaves King Love uncrown'd In this obscure, terrestrial seat! With bale more sweet than others' bliss, And bliss more wise than others' bale, The secrets of the world are his. And freedom without let or pale. O, zealous good, O, virtuous glee, Religious, and without alloy, O, privilege high, which none but he Who highly merits can enjoy; O, Love, who art that fabled sun Which all the world with bounty loads, Without respect of realms, save one, And gilds with double lustre Rhodes; A day of whose delicious life, Though full of terrors, full of tears, Is better than of other life A hundred thousand million years; Thy heavenly splendour magnifies The least commixture of earth's mould, Cheapens thyself in thine own eyes, And makes the foolish mocker bold. II Love Justified What if my pole-star of respect Be dim to others? Shall their ‘Nay,’ Presumably their own defect, Invalidate my heart's strong ‘Yea’? And can they rightly me condemn, If I, with partial love, prefer? I am not more unjust to them, But only not unjust to her. Leave us alone! After awhile, This pool of private charity Shall make its continent an isle, And roll, a world-embracing sea; This foolish zeal of lip for lip, This fond, self-sanction'd, wilful zest, Is that elect relationship Which forms and sanctions all the rest; This little germ of nuptial love, Which springs so simply from the sod, The root is, as my song shall prove, Of all our love to man and God. III Love Serviceable What measure Fate to him shall mete Is not the noble Lover's care; He's heart-sick with a longing sweet To make her happy as she's fair. Oh, misery, should she him refuse, And so her dearest good mistake! His own success he thus pursues With frantic zeal for her sole sake. To lose her were his life to blight, Being loss to hers; to make her his, Except as helping her delight, He calls but accidental bliss; And, holding life as so much pelf To buy her posies, learns this lore: He does not rightly love himself Who does not love another more. IV A Riddle Solved Kind souls, you wonder why, love you, When you, you wonder why, love none. We love, Fool, for the good we do, Not that which unto us is done! THE DEAN 1 The Ladies rose. I held the door, And sigh'd, as her departing grace Assured me that she always wore A heart as happy as her face; And, jealous of the winds that blew, I dreaded, o'er the tasteless wine, What fortune momently might do To hurt the hope that she'd be mine. 2 Towards my mark the Dean's talk set: He praised my ‘Notes on Abury,’ Read when the Association met At Sarum; he was pleased to see I had not stopp'd, as some men had, At Wrangler and Prize Poet; last, He hoped the business was not bad I came about: then the wine pass'd. 3 A full glass prefaced my reply: I loved his daughter, Honor; I told My estate and prospects; might I try To win her? At my words so bold My sick heart sank. Then he: He gave His glad consent, if I could get Her love. A dear, good Girl! she'd have Only three thousand pounds as yet; More bye and bye. Yes, his good will Should go with me; he would not stir; He and my father in old time still Wish'd I should one day marry her; But God so seldom lets us take Our chosen pathway, when it lies In steps that either mar or make Or alter others' destinies, That, though his blessing and his pray'r Had help'd, should help, my suit, yet he Left all to me, his passive share Consent and opportunity. My chance, he hoped, was good: I'd won Some name already; friends and place Appear'd within my reach, but none Her mind and manners would not grace. Girls love to see the men in whom They invest their vanities admired; Besides, where goodness is, there room For good to work will be desired. 'Twas so with one now pass'd away; And what she was at twenty-two, Honor was now; and he might say Mine was a choice I could not rue. 4 He ceased, and gave his hand. He had won (And all my heart was in my word), From me the affection of a son, Whichever fortune Heaven conferr'd! Well, well, would I take more wine? Then go To her; she makes tea on the lawn These fine warm afternoons. And so We went whither my soul was drawn; And her light-hearted ignorance Of interest in our discourse Fill'd me with love, and seem'd to enhance Her beauty with pathetic force, As, through the flowery mazes sweet, Fronting the wind that flutter'd blythe, And loved her shape, and kiss'd her feet, Shown to their insteps proud and lithe, She approach'd, all mildness and young trust, And ever her chaste and noble air Gave to love's feast its choicest gust, A vague, faint augury of despair. CANTO VII Aetna and the Moon PRELUDES I Love's Immortality How vilely 'twere to misdeserve The poet's gift of perfect speech, In song to try, with trembling nerve, The limit of its utmost reach, Only to sound the wretched praise Of what to-morrow shall not be; So mocking with immortal bays The cross-bones of mortality! I do not thus. My faith is fast That all the loveliness I sing Is made to bear the mortal blast, And blossom in a better Spring. Doubts of eternity ne'er cross The Lover's mind, divinely clear: For ever is the gain or loss Which maddens him with hope or fear: So trifles serve for his relief, And trifles make him sick and pale; And yet his pleasure and his grief Are both on a majestic scale. The chance, indefinitely small, Of issue infinitely great, Eclipses finite interests all, And has the dignity of fate. II Heaven and Earth How long shall men deny the flower Because its roots are in the earth, And crave with tears from God the dower They have, and have despised as dearth, And scorn as low their human lot, With frantic pride, too blind to see That standing on the head makes not Either for ease or dignity! But fools shall feel like fools to find (Too late inform'd) that angels' mirth Is one in cause, and mode, and kind With that which they profaned on earth. ÆTNA AND THE MOON 1 To soothe my heart I, feigning, seized A pen, and, showering tears, declared My unfeign'd passion; sadly pleased Only to dream that so I dared. Thus was the fervid truth confess'd, But wild with paradox ran the plea, As wilfully in hope depress'd, Yet bold beyond hope's warranty: 2 ‘O, more than dear, be more than just, ‘And do not deafly shut the door! ‘I claim no right to speak; I trust ‘Mercy, not right; yet who has more? ‘For, if more love makes not more fit, ‘Of claimants here none's more nor less, ‘Since your great worth does not permit ‘Degrees in our unworthiness. ‘Yet, if there's aught that can be done ‘With arduous labour of long years, ‘By which you'll say that you'll be won, ‘O tell me, and I'll dry my tears. ‘Ah, no; if loving cannot move, ‘How foolishly must labour fail! ‘The use of deeds is to show love; ‘If signs suffice let these avail: ‘Your name pronounced brings to my heart ‘A feeling like the violet's breath, ‘Which does so much of heaven impart ‘It makes me amorous of death; ‘The winds that in the garden toss ‘The Guelder-roses give me pain, ‘Alarm me with the dread of loss, ‘Exhaust me with the dream of gain; ‘I'm troubled by the clouds that move; ‘Tired by the breath which I respire; ‘And ever, like a torch, my love, ‘Thus agitated, flames the higher; ‘All's hard that has not you for goal; ‘I scarce can move my hand to write, ‘For love engages all my soul, ‘And leaves the body void of might; ‘The wings of will spread idly, as do ‘The bird's that in a vacuum lies; ‘My breast, asleep with dreams of you, ‘Forgets to breathe, and bursts in sighs; ‘I see no rest this side the grave, ‘No rest nor hope, from you apart; ‘Your life is in the rose you gave, ‘Its perfume suffocates my heart; ‘There's no refreshment in the breeze; ‘The heaven o'erwhelms me with its blue; ‘I faint beside the dancing seas; ‘Winds, skies, and waves are only you; ‘The thought or act which not intends ‘You service, seems a sin and shame; ‘In that one only object ends ‘Conscience, religion, honour, fame. ‘Ah, could I put off love! Could we ‘Never have met! What calm, what ease! ‘Nay, but, alas, this remedy ‘Were ten times worse than the disease! ‘For when, indifferent, I pursue ‘The world's best pleasures for relief, ‘My heart, still sickening back to you, ‘Finds none like memory of its grief; ‘And, though 'twere very hell to hear ‘You felt such misery as I, ‘All good, save you, were far less dear ‘Than is that ill with which I die! ‘Where'er I go, wandering forlorn, ‘You are the world's love, life, and glee: ‘Oh, wretchedness not to be borne ‘If she that's Love should not love me!’ 3 I could not write another word, Through pity for my own distress; And forth I went, untimely stirr'd To make my misery more or less. I went, beneath the heated noon, To where, in her simplicity, She sate at work; and, as the Moon On Ætna smiles, she smiled on me. But, now and then, in cheek and eyes, I saw, or fancied, such a glow As when, in summer-evening skies, Some say, ‘It lightens,’ some say, ‘No.’ ‘Honoria,’ I began—No more. The Dean, by ill or happy hap, Came home; and Wolf burst in before, And put his nose upon her lap. CANTO VIII Sarum Plain PRELUDES I Life of Life What's that, which, ere I spake, was gone: So joyful and intense a spark That, whilst o'erhead the wonder shone, The day, before but dull, grew dark? I do not know; but this I know, That, had the splendour lived a year, The truth that I some heavenly show Did see, could not be now more clear. This know I too: might mortal breath Express the passion then inspired, Evil would die a natural death, And nothing transient be desired; And error from the soul would pass, And leave the senses pure and strong As sunbeams. But the best, alas, Has neither memory nor tongue. II The Revelation An idle poet, here and there, Looks round him; but, for all the rest, The world, unfathomably fair, Is duller than a witling's jest. Love wakes men, once a lifetime each; They lift their heavy lids, and look; And, lo, what one sweet page can teach, They read with joy, then shut the book. And some give thanks, and some blaspheme And most forget; but, either way, That and the Child's unheeded dream Is all the light of all their day. III The Spirit's Epochs Not in the crises of events, Of compass'd hopes, or fears fulfill'd, Or acts of gravest consequence, Are life's delight and depth reveal'd. The day of days was not the day; That went before, or was postponed; The night Death took our lamp away Was not the night on which we groan'd. I drew my bride, beneath the moon, Across my threshold; happy hour! But, ah, the walk that afternoon We saw the water-flags in flower! IV The Prototype Lo, there, whence love, life, light are pour'd, Veil'd with impenetrable rays, Amidst the presence of the Lord Co-equal Wisdom laughs and plays. Female and male God made the man; His image is the whole, not half; And in our love we dimly scan The love which is between Himself. V The Praise of Love Spirit of Knowledge, grant me this: A simple heart and subtle wit To praise the thing whose praise it is That all which can be praised is it. SARUM PLAIN 1 Breakfast enjoy'd, 'mid hush of boughs And perfumes thro' the windows blown; Brief worship done, which still endows The day with beauty not its own; With intervening pause, that paints Each act with honour, life with calm (As old processions of the Saints At every step have wands of palm), We rose; the ladies went to dress, And soon return'd with smiles; and then, Plans fix'd, to which the Dean said ‘Yes,’ Once more we drove to Salisbury Plain. We past my house (observed with praise By Mildred, Mary acquiesced), And left the old and lazy grays Below the hill, and walk'd the rest. 2 The moods of love are like the wind, And none knows whence or why they rise: I ne'er before felt heart and mind So much affected through mine eyes. How cognate with the flatter'd air, How form'd for earth's familiar zone, She moved; how feeling and how fair For others' pleasure and her own! And, ah, the heaven of her face! How, when she laugh'd, I seem'd to see The gladness of the primal grace, And how, when grave, its dignity! Of all she was, the least not less Delighted the devoted eye; No fold or fashion of her dress Her fairness did not sanctify. I could not else than grieve. What cause? Was I not blest? Was she not there? Likely my own? Ah, that it was: How like seem'd ‘likely’ to despair! 3 And yet to see her so benign, So honourable and womanly, In every maiden kindness mine, And full of gayest courtesy, Was pleasure so without alloy, Such unreproved, sufficient bliss, I almost wish'd, the while, that joy Might never further go than this. So much it was as now to walk, And humbly by her gentle side Observe her smile and hear her talk, Could it be more to call her Bride? I feign'd her won; the mind finite, Puzzled and fagg'd by stress and strain To comprehend the whole delight, Made bliss more hard to bear than pain. All good, save heart to hold, so summ'd And grasp'd, the thought smote, like a knife, How laps'd mortality had numb'd The feelings to the feast of life; How passing good breathes sweetest breath; And love itself at highest reveals More black than bright, commending death By teaching how much life conceals. 4 But happier passions these subdued, When from the close and sultry lane, With eyes made bright by what they view'd, We emerged upon the mounded Plain. As to the breeze a flag unfurls, My spirit expanded, sweetly embraced By those same gusts that shook her curls And vex'd the ribbon at her waist. To the future cast I future cares; Breathed with a heart unfreighted, free, And laugh'd at the presumptuous airs That with her muslins folded me; Till, one vague rack along my sky, The thought that she might ne'er be mine Lay half forgotten by the eye So feasted with the sun's warm shine. 5 By the great stones we chose our ground For shade; and there, in converse sweet, Took luncheon. On a little mound Sat the three ladies; at their feet I sat; and smelt the heathy smell, Pluck'd harebells, turn'd the telescope To the country round. My life went well, For once, without the wheels of hope; And I despised the Druid rocks That scowl'd their chill gloom from above, Like churls whose stolid wisdom mocks The lightness of immortal love. And, as we talk'd, my spirit quaff'd The sparkling winds; the candid skies At our untruthful strangeness laugh'd; I kiss'd with mine her smiling eyes; And sweet familiarness and awe Prevail'd that hour on either part, And in the eternal light I saw That she was mine; though yet my heart Could not conceive, nor would confess Such contentation; and there grew More form and more fair stateliness Than heretofore between us two. CANTO IX Sahara PRELUDES I The Wife's Tragedy Man must be pleased; but him to please Is woman's pleasure; down the gulf Of his condoled necessities She casts her best, she flings herself. How often flings for nought, and yokes Her heart to an icicle or whim, Whose each impatient word provokes Another, not from her, but him; While she, too gentle even to force His penitence by kind replies, Waits by, expecting his remorse, With pardon in her pitying eyes; And if he once, by shame oppress'd, A comfortable word confers, She leans and weeps against his breast, And seems to think the sin was hers; And whilst his love has any life, Or any eye to see her charms, At any time, she's still his wife, Dearly devoted to his arms; She loves with love that cannot tire; And when, ah woe, she loves alone, Through passionate duty love springs higher, As grass grows taller round a stone. II Common Graces Is nature in thee too spiritless, Ignoble, impotent, and dead, To prize her love and loveliness The more for being thy daily bread? And art thou one of that vile crew Which see no splendour in the sun, Praising alone the good that's new, Or over, or not yet begun? And has it dawn'd on thy dull wits That love warms many as soft a nest, That, though swathed round with benefits, Thou art not singularly blest? And fail thy thanks for gifts divine, The common food of many a heart, Because they are not only thine? Beware lest in the end thou art Cast for thy pride forth from the fold, Too good to feel the common grace Of blissful myriads who behold For evermore the Father's face. III The Zest of Life Give thanks. It is not time misspent; Worst fare this betters, and the best, Wanting this natural condiment, Breeds crudeness, and will not digest. The grateful love the Giver's law; But those who eat, and look no higher, From sin or doubtful sanction draw The biting sauce their feasts require. Give thanks for nought, if you've no more, And, having all things, do not doubt That nought, with thanks, is blest before Whate'er the world can give, without. IV Fool and Wise Endow the fool with sun and moon, Being his, he holds them mean and low; But to the wise a little boon Is great, because the giver's so. SAHARA 1 I stood by Honor and the Dean, They seated in the London train. A month from her! yet this had been, Ere now, without such bitter pain. But neighbourhood makes parting light, And distance remedy has none; Alone, she near, I felt as might A blind man sitting in the sun; She near, all for the time was well; Hope's self, when we were far apart, With lonely feeling, like the smell Of heath on mountains, fill'd my heart. To see her seem'd delight's full scope, And her kind smile, so clear of care, Ev'n then, though darkening all my hope, Gilded the cloud of my despair. 2 She had forgot to bring a book. I lent one; blamed the print for old; And did not tell her that she took A Petrarch worth its weight in gold. I hoped she'd lose it; for my love Was grown so dainty, high, and nice, It prized no luxury above The sense of fruitless sacrifice. 3 The bell rang, and, with shrieks like death, Link catching link, the long array, With ponderous pulse and fiery breath, Proud of its burthen, swept away; And through the lingering crowd I broke, Sought the hill-side, and thence, heart-sick, Beheld, far off, the little smoke Along the landscape kindling quick. 4 What should I do, where should I go, Now she was gone, my love! for mine She was, whatever here below Cross'd or usurp'd my right divine. Life, without her, was vain and gross, The glory from the world was gone, And on the gardens of the Close As on Sahara shone the sun. Oppress'd with her departed grace, My thoughts on ill surmises fed; The harmful influence of the place She went to fill'd my soul with dread. She, mixing with the people there, Might come back alter'd, having caught The foolish, fashionable air Of knowing all, and feeling nought. Or, giddy with her beauty's praise, She'd scorn our simple country life, Its wholesome nights and tranquil days, And would not deign to be my Wife. ‘My Wife,’ ‘my Wife,’ ah, tenderest word! How oft, as fearful she might hear, Whispering that name of ‘Wife,’ I heard The chiming of the inmost sphere. 5 I pass'd the home of my regret. The clock was striking in the hall, And one sad window open yet, Although the dews began to fall. Ah, distance show'd her beauty's scope! How light of heart and innocent That loveliness which sicken'd hope And wore the world for ornament! How perfectly her life was framed; And, thought of in that passionate mood, How her affecting graces shamed The vulgar life that was but good! 6 I wonder'd, would her bird be fed, Her rose-plots water'd, she not by; Loading my breast with angry dread Of light, unlikely injury. So, fill'd with love and fond remorse, I paced the Close, its every part Endow'd with reliquary force To heal and raise from death my heart. How tranquil and unsecular The precinct! Once, through yonder gate, I saw her go, and knew from far Her love-lit form and gentle state. Her dress had brush'd this wicket; here She turn'd her face, and laugh'd, with light Like moonbeams on a wavering mere. Weary beforehand of the night, I went; the blackbird, in the wood, Talk'd by himself, and eastward grew In heaven the symbol of my mood, Where one bright star engross'd the blue. CANTO X Going to Church PRELUDES I The Joyful Wisdom Would Wisdom for herself be woo'd, And wake the foolish from his dream, She must be glad as well as good, And must not only be, but seem. Beauty and joy are hers by right; And, knowing this, I wonder less That she's so scorn'd, when falsely dight In misery and ugliness. What's that which Heaven to man endears, And that which eyes no sooner see Than the heart says, with floods of tears, ‘Ah, that's the thing which I would be!’ Not childhood, full of frown and fret; Not youth, impatient to disown Those visions high, which to forget Were worse than never to have known; Not worldlings, in whose fair outside Nor courtesy nor justice fails, Thanks to cross-pulling vices tied, Like Samson's foxes, by the tails; Not poets; real things are dreams, When dreams are as realities, And boasters of celestial gleams Go stumbling aye for want of eyes; Not patriots nor people's men, In whom two worse-match'd evils meet Than ever sought Adullam's den, Base conscience and a high conceit; Not new-made saints, their feelings iced, Their joy in man and nature gone, Who sing ‘O easy yoke of Christ!’ But find 'tis hard to get it on; Not great men, even when they're good; The good man whom the time makes great, By some disgrace of chance or blood, God fails not to humiliate; Not these: but souls, found here and there, Oases in our waste of sin, Where everything is well and fair, And Heav'n remits its discipline; Whose sweet subdual of the world The worldling scarce can recognise, And ridicule, against it hurl'd, Drops with a broken sting and dies; Who nobly, if they cannot know Whether a 'scutcheon's dubious field Carries a falcon or a crow, Fancy a falcon on the shield; Yet, ever careful not to hurt God's honour, who creates success, Their praise of even the best desert Is but to have presumed no less; Who, should their own life plaudits bring, Are simply vex'd at heart that such An easy, yea, delightful thing Should move the minds of men so much. They live by law, not like the fool, But like the bard, who freely sings In strictest bonds of rhyme and rule, And finds in them, not bonds, but wings. Postponing still their private ease To courtly custom, appetite, Subjected to observances, To banquet goes with full delight; Nay, continence and gratitude So cleanse their lives from earth's alloy, They taste, in Nature's common food, Nothing but spiritual joy. They shine like Moses in the face, And teach our hearts, without the rod, That God's grace is the only grace, And all grace is the grace of God. II The Devices Love, kiss'd by Wisdom, wakes twice Love, And Wisdom is, thro' loving, wise. Let Dove and Snake, and Snake and Dove, This Wisdom's be, that Love's device. GOING TO CHURCH 1 I woke at three; for I was bid To breakfast with the Dean at nine, And thence to Church. My curtain slid, I found the dawning Sunday fine; And could not rest, so rose. The air Was dark and sharp; the roosted birds Cheep'd, ‘Here am I, Sweet; are you there?’ On Avon's misty flats the herds Expected, comfortless, the day, Which slowly fired the clouds above; The cock scream'd, somewhere far away; In sleep the matrimonial dove Was crooning; no wind waked the wood, Nor moved the midnight river-damps, Nor thrill'd the poplar; quiet stood The chestnut with its thousand lamps; The moon shone yet, but weak and drear, And seem'd to watch, with bated breath, The landscape, all made sharp and clear By stillness, as a face by death. 2 My pray'rs for her being done, I took Occasion by the quiet hour To find and know, by Rule and Book, The rights of love's beloved power. 3 Fronting the question without ruth, Nor ignorant that, evermore, If men will stoop to kiss the Truth, She lifts them higher than before, I, from above, such light required As now should once for all destroy The folly which at times desired A sanction for so great a joy. 4 Thenceforth, and through that pray'r, I trod A path with no suspicions dim. I loved her in the name of God, And for the ray she was of Him; I ought to admire much more, not less; Her beauty was a godly grace; The mystery of loveliness, Which made an altar of her face, Was not of the flesh, though that was fair, But a most pure and living light Without a name, by which the rare And virtuous spirit flamed to sight. If oft, in love, effect lack'd cause And cause effect, 'twere vain to soar Reasons to seek for that which was Reason itself, or something more. My joy was no idolatry Upon the ends of the vile earth bent, For when I loved her most then I Most yearn'd for more divine content. That other doubt, which, like a ghost, In the brain's darkness haunted me, Was thus resolved: Him loved I most, But her I loved most sensibly. Lastly, my giddiest hope allow'd No selfish thought, or earthly smirch; And forth I went, in peace, and proud To take my passion into Church; Grateful and glad to think that all Such doubts would seem entirely vain To her whose nature's lighter fall Made no divorce of heart from brain. 5 I found them, with exactest grace And fresh as Spring, for Spring attired; And by the radiance in her face I saw she felt she was admired; And, through the common luck of love, A moment's fortunate delay, To fit the little lilac glove, Gave me her arm; and I and they (They true to this and every hour, As if attended on by Time), Enter'd the Church while yet the tower Was noisy with the finish'd chime. 6 Her soft voice, singularly heard Beside me, in her chant, withstood The roar of voices, like a bird Sole warbling in a windy wood; And, when we knelt, she seem'd to be An angel teaching me to pray; And all through the high Liturgy My spirit rejoiced without allay, Being, for once, borne clearly above All banks and bars of ignorance, By this bright spring-tide of pure love And floated in a free expanse, Whence it could see from side to side, The obscurity from every part Winnow'd away and purified By the vibrations of my heart. CANTO XI The Dance PRELUDES I The Daughter of Eve The woman's gentle mood o'erstept Withers my love, that lightly scans The rest, and does in her accept All her own faults, but none of man's. As man I cannot judge her ill, Or honour her fair station less, Who, with a woman's errors, still Preserves a woman's gentleness; For thus I think, if one I see Who disappoints my high desire, ‘How admirable would she be, ‘Could she but know how I admire!’ Or fail she, though from blemish clear, To charm, I call it my defect; And so my thought, with reverent fear To err by doltish disrespect, Imputes love's great regard, and says, ‘Though unapparent 'tis to me, ‘Be sure this Queen some other sways ‘With well-perceiv'd supremacy.’ Behold the worst! Light from above On the blank ruin writes ‘Forbear! ‘Her first crime was unguarded love, ‘And all the rest, perhaps, despair.’ Discrown'd, dejected, but not lost, O, sad one, with no more a name Or place in all the honour'd host Of maiden and of matron fame, Grieve on; but, if thou grievest right, 'Tis not that these abhor thy state, Nor would'st thou lower the least the height Which makes thy casting down so great. Good is thy lot in its degree; For hearts that verily repent Are burden'd with impunity And comforted by chastisement. Sweet patience sanctify thy woes! And doubt not but our God is just, Albeit unscathed thy traitor goes, And thou art stricken to the dust. That penalty's the best to bear Which follows soonest on the sin; And guilt's a game where losers fare Better than those who seem to win. II Aurea Dicta 'Tis truth (although this truth's a star Too deep-enskied for all to see), As poets of grammar, lovers are The fountains of morality. Child, would you shun the vulgar doom, In love disgust, in death despair? Know, death must come and love must come, And so for each your soul prepare. Who pleasure follows pleasure slays; God's wrath upon himself he wreaks; But all delights rejoice his days Who takes with thanks, and never seeks. The wrong is made and measured by The right's inverted dignity. Change love to shame, as love is high So low in hell your bed shall be. How easy to keep free from sin! How hard that freedom to recall! For dreadful truth it is that men Forget the heavens from which they fall. Lest sacred love your soul ensnare, With pious fancy still infer ‘How loving and how lovely fair ‘Must He be who has fashion'd her!’ Become whatever good you see, Nor sigh if, forthwith, fades from view The grace of which you may not be The subject and spectator too. Love's perfect blossom only blows Where noble manners veil defect. Angels may be familiar; those Who err each other must respect. Love blabb'd of is a great decline; A careless word unsanctions sense; But he who casts Heaven's truth to swine Consummates all incontinence. Not to unveil before the gaze Of an imperfect sympathy In aught we are, is the sweet praise And the main sum of modesty. THE DANCE 1 ‘My memory of Heaven awakes! ‘She's not of the earth, although her light, ‘As lantern'd by her body, makes ‘A piece of it past bearing bright. ‘So innocently proud and fair ‘She is, that Wisdom sings for glee ‘And Folly dies, breathing one air ‘With such a bright-cheek'd chastity; ‘And though her charms are a strong law ‘Compelling all men to admire, ‘They go so clad with lovely awe ‘None but the noble dares desire. ‘He who would seek to make her his ‘Will comprehend that souls of grace ‘Own sweet repulsion, and that 'tis ‘The quality of their embrace ‘To be like the majestic reach ‘Of coupled suns, that, from afar, ‘Mingle their mutual spheres, while each ‘Circles the twin obsequious star; ‘And, in the warmth of hand to hand, ‘Of heart to heart, he'll vow to note ‘And reverently understand ‘How the two spirits shine remote; ‘And ne'er to numb fine honour's nerve, ‘Nor let sweet awe in passion melt, ‘Nor fail by courtesies to observe ‘The space which makes attraction felt; ‘Nor cease to guard like life the sense ‘Which tells him that the embrace of love ‘Is o'er a gulf of difference ‘Love cannot sound, nor death remove.’ 2 This learn'd I, watching where she danced, Native to melody and light, And now and then toward me glanced, Pleased, as I hoped, to please my sight. 3 Ah, love to speak was impotent, Till music did a tongue confer, And I ne'er knew what music meant, Until I danced to it with her. Too proud of the sustaining power Of my, till then, unblemish'd joy, My passion, for reproof, that hour Tasted mortality's alloy, And bore me down an eddying gulf; I wish'd the world might run to wreck, So I but once might fling myself Obliviously about her neck. I press'd her hand, by will or chance I know not, but I saw the rays Withdrawn, which did till then enhance Her fairness with its thanks for praise. I knew my spirit's vague offence Was patent to the dreaming eye And heavenly tact of innocence, And did for fear my fear defy, And ask'd her for the next dance. ‘Yes.’ ‘No,’ had not fall'n with half the force. She was fulfill'd with gentleness, And I with measureless remorse; And, ere I slept, on bended knee I own'd myself, with many a tear, Unseasonable, disorderly, And a deranger of love's sphere; Gave thanks that, when we stumble and fall, We hurt ourselves, and not the truth; And, rising, found its brightness all The brighter through the tears of ruth. 4 Nor was my hope that night made less, Though order'd, humbled, and reproved; Her farewell did her heart express As much, but not with anger, moved. My trouble had my soul betray'd; And, in the night of my despair, My love, a flower of noon afraid, Divulged its fulness unaware. I saw she saw; and, O sweet Heaven, Could my glad mind have credited That influence had to me been given To affect her so, I should have said That, though she from herself conceal'd Love's felt delight and fancied harm, They made her face the jousting field Of joy and beautiful alarm. CANTO XII The Abdication PRELUDES I The Chace She wearies with an ill unknown; In sleep she sobs and seems to float, A water-lily, all alone Within a lonely castle-moat; And as the full-moon, spectral, lies Within the crescent's gleaming arms, The present shows her heedless eyes A future dim with vague alarms. She sees, and yet she scarcely sees, For, life-in-life not yet begun, Too many are its mysteries For thought to fix on any one. She's told that maidens are by youths Extremely honour'd and desired; And sighs, ‘If those sweet tales be truths, ‘What bliss to be so much admired!’ The suitors come; she sees them grieve; Her coldness fills them with despair; She'd pity if she could believe; She's sorry that she cannot care. But who now meets her on her way? Comes he as enemy or friend, Or both? Her bosom seems to say, He cannot pass, and there an end. Whom does he love? Does he confer His heart on worth that answers his? Or is he come to worship her? She fears, she hopes, she thinks he is! Advancing stepless, quick, and still, As in the grass a serpent glides, He fascinates her fluttering will, Then terrifies with dreadful strides. At first, there's nothing to resist; He fights with all the forms of peace; He comes about her like a mist, With subtle, swift, unseen increase; And then, unlook'd for, strikes amain Some stroke that frightens her to death, And grows all harmlessness again, Ere she can cry, or get her breath. At times she stops, and stands at bay; But he, in all more strong than she, Subdues her with his pale dismay, Or more admired audacity. She plans some final, fatal blow, But when she means with frowns to kill He looks as if he loved her so, She smiles to him against her will. How sweetly he implies her praise! His tender talk, his gentle tone, The manly worship in his gaze, They nearly made her heart his own. With what an air he speaks her name; His manner always recollects Her sex, and still the woman's claim Is taught its scope by his respects. Her charms, perceived to prosper first In his beloved advertencies, When in her glass they are rehearsed, Prove his most powerful allies. Ah, whither shall a maiden flee, When a bold youth so swift pursues, And siege of tenderest courtesy, With hope perseverant, still renews! Why fly so fast? Her flatter'd breast Thanks him who finds her fair and good; She loves her fears; veil'd joys arrest The foolish terrors of her blood. By secret, sweet degrees, her heart, Vanquish'd, takes warmth from his desire; She makes it more, with hidden art, And fuels love's late dreaded fire. The generous credit he accords To all the signs of good in her Redeems itself; his praiseful words The virtues they impute confer. Her heart is thrice as rich in bliss, She's three times gentler than before; He gains a right to call her his Now she through him is so much more; 'Tis heaven where'er she turns her head; Tis music when she talks; 'tis air On which, elate, she seems to tread, The convert of a gladder sphere! Ah, might he, when by doubts aggrieved, Behold his tokens next her breast, At all his words and sighs perceived Against its blythe upheaval press'd! But still she flies. Should she be won, It must not be believed or thought She yields; she's chased to death, undone, Surprised, and violently caught. II Denied The storm-cloud, whose portentous shade Fumes from a core of smother'd fire, His livery is whose worshipp'd maid Denies herself to his desire. Ah, grief that almost crushes life, To lie upon his lonely bed, And fancy her another's wife! His brain is flame, his heart is lead. Sinking at last, by nature's course, Cloak'd round with sleep from his despair, He does but sleep to gather force That goes to his exhausted care. He wakes renew'd for all the smart. His only Love, and she is wed! His fondness comes about his heart, As milk comes, when the babe is dead. The wretch, whom she found fit for scorn, His own allegiant thoughts despise; And far into the shining morn Lazy with misery he lies. III The Churl This marks the Churl: when spousals crown His selfish hope, he finds the grace, Which sweet love has for even the clown, Was not in the woman, but the chace. THE ABDICATION 1 From little signs, like little stars, Whose faint impression on the sense The very looking straight at mars, Or only seen by confluence; From instinct of a mutual thought, Whence sanctity of manners flow'd; From chance unconscious, and from what Concealment, overconscious, show'd; Her hand's less weight upon my arm, Her lowlier mien; that match'd with this; I found, and felt with strange alarm, I stood committed to my bliss. 2 I grew assured, before I ask'd, That she'd be mine without reserve, And in her unclaim'd graces bask'd, At leisure, till the time should serve, With just enough of dread to thrill The hope, and make it trebly dear; Thus loth to speak the word to kill Either the hope or happy fear. 3 Till once, through lanes returning late, Her laughing sisters lagg'd behind; And, ere we reach'd her father's gate, We paused with one presentient mind; And, in the dim and perfumed mist, Their coming stay'd, who, friends to me, And very women, loved to assist Love's timid opportunity. 4 Twice rose, twice died my trembling word; The faint and frail Cathedral chimes Spake time in music, and we heard The chafers rustling in the limes. Her dress, that touch'd me where I stood, The warmth of her confided arm, Her bosom's gentle neighbourhood, Her pleasure in her power to charm; Her look, her love, her form, her touch, The least seem'd most by blissful turn, Blissful but that it pleased too much, And taught the wayward soul to yearn. It was as if a harp with wires Was traversed by the breath I drew; And, oh, sweet meeting of desires, She, answering, own'd that she loved too. 5 Honoria was to be my bride! The hopeless heights of hope were scaled; The summit won, I paused and sigh'd, As if success itself had fail'd. It seem'd as if my lips approach'd To touch at Tantalus' reward, And rashly on Eden life encroach'd, Half-blinded by the flaming sword. The whole world's wealthiest and its best, So fiercely sought, appear'd, when found, Poor in its need to be possess'd, Poor from its very want of bound. My queen was crouching at my side, By love unsceptred and brought low, Her awful garb of maiden pride All melted into tears like snow; The mistress of my reverent thought, Whose praise was all I ask'd of fame, In my close-watch'd approval sought Protection as from danger and blame; Her soul, which late I loved to invest With pity for my poor desert, Buried its face within my breast, Like a pet fawn by hunters hurt. BOOK II THE PROLOGUE 1 Her sons pursue the butterflies, Her baby daughter mocks the doves With throbbing coo; in his fond eyes She's Venus with her little Loves; Her footfall dignifies the earth, Her form's the native-land of grace, And, lo, his coming lights with mirth Its court and capital her face! Full proud her favour makes her lord, And that her flatter'd bosom knows. She takes his arm without a word, In lanes of laurel and of rose. Ten years to-day has she been his. He but begins to understand, He says, the dignity and bliss She gave him when she gave her hand. She, answering, says, he disenchants The past, though that was perfect; he Rejoins, the present nothing wants But briefness to be ecstasy. He lauds her charms; her beauty's glow Wins from the spoiler Time new rays; Bright looks reply, approving so Beauty's elixir vitæ, praise. Upon a beech he bids her mark Where, ten years since, he carved her name; It grows there with the growing bark, And in his heart it grows the same. For that her soft arm presses his Close to her fond, maternal breast; He tells her, each new kindness is The effectual sum of all the rest! And, whilst the cushat, mocking, coo'd, They blest the days they had been wed, At cost of those in which he woo'd, Till everything was three times said; And words were growing vain, when Briggs, Factotum, Footman, Butler, Groom, Who press'd the cyder, fed the pigs, Preserv'd the rabbits, drove the brougham, And help'd, at need, to mow the lawns, And sweep the paths and thatch the hay, Here brought the Post down, Mrs. Vaughan's Sole rival, but, for once, to-day, Scarce look'd at; for the ‘Second Book,’ Till this tenth festival kept close, Was thus commenced, while o'er them shook The laurel married with the rose. 2 ‘The pulse of War, whose bloody heats ‘Sane purposes insanely work, ‘Now with fraternal frenzy beats, ‘And binds the Christian to the Turk, ‘And shrieking fifes’— 3 But, with a roar, In rush'd the Loves; the tallest roll'd A hedgehog from his pinafore, Which saved his fingers; Baby, bold, Touch'd it, and stared, and scream'd for life, And stretch'd her hand for Vaughan to kiss, Who hugg'd his Pet, and ask'd his wife, ‘Is this for love, or love for this?’ But she turn'd pale, for, lo, the beast, Found stock-still in the rabbit-trap, And feigning so to be deceased, And laid by Frank upon her lap, Unglobed himself, and show'd his snout, And fell, scatt'ring the Loves amain, With shriek, with laughter, and with shout; And, peace at last restored again, The Bard, who this untimely hitch Bore with a calm magnanimous, (The hedgehog roll'd into a ditch, And Venus sooth'd), proceeded thus: CANTO I Accepted PRELUDES I The Song of Songs The pulse of War, whose bloody heats Sane purposes insanely work, Now with fraternal frenzy beats, And binds the Christian to the Turk, And shrieking fifes and braggart flags, Through quiet England, teach our breath The courage corporate that drags The coward to heroic death. Too late for song! Who henceforth sings, Must fledge his heavenly flight with more Song-worthy and heroic things Than hasty, home-destroying war. While might and right are not agreed, And battle thus is yet to wage, So long let laurels be the meed Of soldier as of poet sage; But men expect the Tale of Love, And weary of the Tale of Hate; Lift me, O Muse, myself above, And let the world no longer wait! II The Kites I saw three Cupids (so I dream'd), Who made three kites, on which were drawn, In letters that like roses gleam'd, ‘Plato,’ ‘Anacreon,’ and ‘Vaughan.’ The boy who held by Plato tried His airy venture first; all sail, It heav'nward rush'd till scarce descried, Then pitch'd and dropp'd, for want of tail. Anacreon's Love, with shouts of mirth That pride of spirit thus should fall, To his kite link'd a lump of earth, And, lo, it would not soar at all. Last, my disciple freighted his With a long streamer made of flowers, The children of the sod, and this Rose in the sun, and flew for hours. III Orpheus The music of the Sirens found Ulysses weak, though cords were strong; But happier Orpheus stood unbound, And shamed it with a sweeter song. His mode be mine. Of Heav'n I ask, May I, with heart-persuading might, Pursue the Poet's sacred task Of superseding faith by sight, Till ev'n the witless Gadarene, Preferring Christ to swine, shall know That life is sweetest when it's clean. To prouder folly let me show Earth by divine light made divine; And let the saints, who hear my word, Say, ‘Lo, the clouds begin to shine ‘About the coming of the Lord!’ IV Nearest the Dearest Till Eve was brought to Adam, he A solitary desert trod, Though in the great society Of nature, angels, and of God. If one slight column counterweighs The ocean, 'tis the Maker's law, Who deems obedience better praise Than sacrifice of erring awe. V Perspective What seems to us for us is true. The planet has no proper light, And yet, when Venus is in view, No primal star is half so bright. ACCEPTED 1 What fortune did my heart foretell? What shook my spirit, as I woke, Like the vibration of a bell Of which I had not heard the stroke? Was it some happy vision shut From memory by the sun's fresh ray? Was it that linnet's song; or but A natural gratitude for day? Or the mere joy the senses weave, A wayward ecstasy of life? Then I remember'd, yester-eve I won Honoria for my Wife. 2 Forth riding, while as yet the day Was dewy, watching Sarum Spire, Still beckoning me along my way, And growing every minute higher, I reach'd the Dean's. One blind was down, Though nine then struck. My bride to be! And had she rested ill, my own, With thinking (oh, my heart!) of me? I paced the streets; a pistol chose, To guard my now important life When riding late from Sarum Close; At noon return'd. Good Mrs. Fife, To my, ‘The Dean, is he at home?’ Said, ‘No, Sir; but Miss Honor is;’ And straight, not asking if I'd come, Announced me, ‘Mr. Felix, Miss,’ To Mildred, in the Study. There We talk'd, she working. We agreed The day was fine; the Fancy-Fair Successful; ‘Did I ever read ‘De Genlis?’ ‘Never.’ ‘Do! She heard ‘I was engaged.’ ‘To whom?’ ‘Miss Fry.’ ‘Was it the fact?’ ‘No!’ ‘On my word?’ ‘What scandal people talk'd!’ ‘Would I ‘Hold out this skein of silk.’ So pass'd I knew not how much time away. ‘How were her sisters?’ ‘Well.’ At last I summon'd heart enough to say, ‘I hoped to see Miss Churchill too.’ ‘Miss Churchill, Felix! What is this? ‘I said, and now I find 'tis true, ‘Last night you quarrell'd! Here she is.’ 3 She came, and seem'd a morning rose When ruffling rain has paled its blush; Her crown once more was on her brows; And, with a faint, indignant flush, And fainter smile, she gave her hand, But not her eyes, then sate apart, As if to make me understand The honour of her vanquish'd heart. But I drew humbly to her side; And she, well pleased, perceiving me Liege ever to the noble pride Of her unconquer'd majesty, Once and for all put it away; The faint flush pass'd; and, thereupon, Her loveliness, which rather lay In light than colour, smiled and shone, Till sick was all my soul with bliss; Or was it with remorse and ire Of such a sanctity as this Subdued by love to my desire? CANTO II The Course of True Love PRELUDES I The Changed Allegiance Watch how a bird, that captived sings, The cage set open, first looks out, Yet fears the freedom of his wings, And now withdraws, and flits about, And now looks forth again; until, Grown bold, he hops on stool and chair, And now attains the window-sill, And now confides himself to air. The maiden so, from love's free sky In chaste and prudent counsels caged, But longing to be loosen'd by Her suitor's faith declared and gaged, When blest with that release desired, First doubts if truly she is free, Then pauses, restlessly retired, Alarm'd at too much liberty; But soon, remembering all her debt To plighted passion, gets by rote Her duty; says, ‘I love him!’ yet The thought half chokes her in her throat; And, like that fatal ‘I am thine,’ Comes with alternate gush and check And joltings of the heart, as wine Pour'd from a flask of narrow neck. Is he indeed her choice? She fears Her Yes was rashly said, and shame, Remorse, and ineffectual tears Revolt from his conceded claim. Oh, treason! So, with desperate nerve, She cries, ‘I am in love, am his;’ Lets run the cables of reserve, And floats into a sea of bliss, And laughs to think of her alarm, Avows she was in love before, Though his avowal was the charm Which open'd to her own the door. She loves him for his mastering air, Whence, Parthian-like, she slaying flies; His flattering look, which seems to wear Her loveliness in manly eyes; His smile, which, by reverse, portends An awful wrath, should reason stir; (How fortunate it is they're friends, And he will ne'er be wroth with her!) His power to do or guard from harm; If he but chose to use it half, And catch her up in one strong arm, What could she do but weep, or laugh! His words, which still instruct, but so That this applause seems still implied, ‘How wise in all she ought to know, ‘How ignorant of all beside!’ His skilful suit, which leaves her free, Gives nothing for the world to name, And keeps her conscience safe, while he, With half the bliss, takes all the blame; His clear repute with great and small; The jealousy his choice will stir; But, ten times more than ten times all, She loves him for his love of her. How happy 'tis he seems to see In her that utter loveliness Which she, for his sake, longs to be! At times, she cannot but confess Her other friends are somewhat blind; Her parents' years excuse neglect, But all the rest are scarcely kind, And brothers grossly want respect; And oft she views what he admires Within her glass, and sight of this Makes all the sum of her desires To be devotion unto his. But still, at first, whatever's done, A touch, her hand press'd lightly, she Stands dizzied, shock'd, and flush'd, like one Set sudden neck-deep in the sea; And, though her bond for endless time To his good pleasure gives her o'er, The slightest favour seems a crime, Because it makes her love him more. But that she ne'er will let him know; For what were love should reverence cease! A thought which makes her reason so Inscrutable, it seems caprice. With her, as with a desperate town, Too weak to stand, too proud to treat, The conqueror, though the walls are down, Has still to capture street by street; But, after that, habitual faith, Divorced from self, where late 'twas due, Walks nobly in its novel path, And she's to changed allegiance true; And prizing what she can't prevent, (Right wisdom, often misdeem'd whim), Her will's indomitably bent On mere submissiveness to him; To him she'll cleave, for him forsake Father's and mother's fond command! He is her lord, for he can take Hold of her faint heart with his hand. II Beauty ‘Beauty deludes.’ O shaft well shot, To strike the mark's true opposite! That ugly good is scorn'd proves not Tis beauty lies, but lack of it. By Heaven's law the Jew might take A slave to wife, if she was fair; So strong a plea does beauty make That, where 'tis seen, discretion's there. If, by a monstrous chance, we learn That this illustrious vaunt's a lie, Our minds, by which the eyes discern, See hideous contrariety, And laugh at Nature's wanton mood, Which, thus a swinish thing to flout, Though haply in its gross way good, Hangs such a jewel in its snout. III Lais and Lucretia Did first his beauty wake her sighs? That's Lais! Thus Lucretia's known: The beauty in her Lover's eyes Was admiration of her own. THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE 1 Oh, beating heart of sweet alarm, Which stays the lover's step, when near His mistress and her awful charm Of grace and innocence sincere! I held the half-shut door, and heard The voice of my betrothed wife, Who sang my verses, every word By music taught its latent life; With interludes of well-touch'd notes, That flash'd, surprising and serene, As meteor after meteor floats The soft, autumnal stars between. There was a passion in her tone, A tremor when she touch'd the keys, Which told me she was there alone, And uttering all her soul at ease. I enter'd; for I did not choose To learn how in her heart I throve, By chance or stealth; beyond her use, Her greeting flatter'd me with love. 2 With true love's treacherous confidence, And ire, at last to laughter won, She spoke this speech, and mark'd its sense, By action, as her Aunt had done. 3 ‘“You, with your looks and catching air, ‘“To think of Vaughan! You fool! You know, ‘“You might, with ordinary care, ‘“Ev'n yet be Lady Clitheroe. ‘“You're sure he'll do great things some day! ‘“Nonsense, he won't; he's dress'd too well. ‘“Dines with the Sterling Club, they say; ‘“Not commonly respectable! ‘“Half Puritan, half Cavalier! ‘“His curly hair I think's a wig; ‘“And, for his fortune, why, my Dear, ‘“'Tis not enough to keep a gig. ‘“Rich Aunts and Uncles never die; ‘“And what you bring won't do for dress; ‘“And so you'll live on Bye-and-bye, ‘“With oaten-cake and water-cress!” 4 ‘I cried, but did not let her see. ‘At last she soften'd her dispraise, ‘On learning you had bought for me ‘A carriage and a pair of bays. ‘But here she comes! You take her in ‘To dinner. I impose this task: ‘Make her approve my love; and win ‘What thanks from me you choose to ask!’ 5 ‘My niece has told you every word ‘I said of you! What may I mean? ‘Of course she has; but you've not heard ‘How I abused you to the Dean;— ‘Yes, I'll take wine; he's mad, like her; ‘And she will have you: there it ends! ‘And, now I've done my duty, Sir, ‘And you've shown common-sense, we're friends!’ 6 ‘Go, Child, and see him out yourself,’ Aunt Maude said, after tea, ‘and show ‘The place, upon that upper shelf, ‘Where Petrarch stands, lent long ago.’ 7 ‘These rose-leaves to my heart be press'd, ‘Honoria, while it aches for you!’ (The rose in ruin, from her breast, Fell, as I took a fond adieu.) ‘You must go now, Love!’ ‘See, the air ‘Is thick with starlight!’ ‘Let me tie ‘This scarf on. Oh, your Petrarch! There! ‘I'm coming, Aunt!’ ‘Sweet, Sweet!’ ‘Good-bye!’ ‘Ah, Love, to me 'tis death to part, ‘Yet you, my sever'd life, smile on!’ ‘These “Good-nights,” Felix, break my heart; ‘I'm only gay till you are gone!’ With love's bright arrows from her eyes, And balm on her permissive lips, She pass'd, and night was a surprise, As when the sun at Quito dips. Her beauties were like sunlit snows, Flush'd but not warm'd with my desire. Oh, how I loved her! Fiercely glows In the pure air of frost the fire Who for a year is sure of fate! I thought, dishearten'd, as I went, Wroth with the Dean, who bade me wait, And vex'd with her, who seem'd content. Nay, could eternal life afford That tyranny should thus deduct From this fair land, which call'd me lord, A year of the sweet usufruct? It might not and it should not be! I'd go back now, and he must own, At once, my love's compulsive plea. I turn'd, I found the Dean alone. ‘Nonsense, my friend; go back to bed! ‘It's half-past twelve!’ ‘July, then, Sir?’ ‘Well, come to-morrow,’ at last he said, ‘And you may talk of it with her.’ A light gleam'd as I pass'd the stair. A pausing foot, a flash of dress, And a sweet voice. ‘Is Felix there?’ ‘July, Love!’ ‘Says Papa so?’ ‘Yes!’ CANTO III The County Ball PRELUDES I Love Ceremonious Keep your undrest, familiar style For strangers, but respect your friend, Her most, whose matrimonial smile Is and asks honour without end. 'Tis found, and needs it must so be, That life from love's allegiance flags, When love forgets his majesty In sloth's unceremonious rags. Let love make home a gracious Court; There let the world's rude, hasty ways Be fashion'd to a loftier port, And learn to bow and stand at gaze; And let the sweet respective sphere Of personal worship there obtain Circumference for moving clear, None treading on another's train. This makes that pleasures do not cloy, And dignifies our mortal strife With calmness and considerate joy, Befitting our immortal life. II The Rainbow A stately rainbow came and stood, When I was young, in High-Hurst Park; Its bright feet lit the hill and wood Beyond, and cloud and sward were dark; And I, who thought the splendour ours Because the place was, t'wards it flew, And there, amidst the glittering showers, Gazed vainly for the glorious view. With whatsoever's lovely, know It is not ours; stand off to see, Or beauty's apparition so Puts on invisibility. III A Paradox To tryst Love blindfold goes, for fear He should not see, and eyeless night He chooses still for breathing near Beauty, that lives but in the sight. THE COUNTY BALL 1 Well, Heaven be thank'd my first-love fail'd, As, Heaven be thank'd, our first-loves do! Thought I, when Fanny past me sail'd, Loved once, for what I never knew, Unless for colouring in her talk, When cheeks and merry mouth would show Three roses on a single stalk, The middle wanting room to blow, And forward ways, that charm'd the boy Whose love-sick mind, misreading fate, Scarce hoped that any Queen of Joy Could ever stoop to be his mate. 2 But there danced she, who from the leaven Of ill preserv'd my heart and wit All unawares, for she was heaven, Others at best but fit for it. One of those lovely things she was In whose least action there can be Nothing so transient but it has An air of immortality. I mark'd her step, with peace elate, Her brow more beautiful than morn, Her sometime look of girlish state Which sweetly waived its right to scorn; The giddy crowd, she grave the while, Although, as 'twere beyond her will, Around her mouth the baby smile, That she was born with, linger'd still. Her ball-dress seem'd a breathing mist, From the fair form exhaled and shed, Raised in the dance with arm and wrist All warmth and light, unbraceleted. Her motion, feeling 'twas beloved, The pensive soul of tune express'd, And, oh, what perfume, as she moved, Came from the flowers in her breast! How sweet a tongue the music had! ‘Beautiful Girl,’ it seem'd to say, ‘Though all the world were vile and sad, ‘Dance on; let innocence be gay.’ Ah, none but I discern'd her looks, When in the throng she pass'd me by, For love is like a ghost, and brooks Only the chosen seer's eye; And who but she could e'er divine The halo and the happy trance, When her bright arm reposed on mine, In all the pauses of the dance! 3 Whilst so her beauty fed my sight, And whilst I lived in what she said, Accordant airs, like all delight Most sweet when noted least, were play'd; And was it like the Pharisee If I in secret bow'd my face With joyful thanks that I should be, Not as were many, but with grace, And fortune of well-nurtured youth, And days no sordid pains defile, And thoughts accustom'd to the truth, Made capable of her fair smile? 4 Charles Barton follow'd down the stair, To talk with me about the Ball, And carp at all the people there. The Churchills chiefly stirr'd his gall: ‘Such were the Kriemhilds and Isondes ‘You storm'd about at Trinity! ‘Nothing at heart but handsome Blondes! ‘Folk say that you and Fanny Fry—’ ‘They err! Good-night! Here lies my course, ‘Through Wilton.’ Silence blest my ears, And, weak at heart with vague remorse, A passing poignancy of tears Attack'd mine eyes. By pale and park I rode, and ever seem'd to see, In the transparent starry dark, That splendid brow of chastity, That soft and yet subduing light, At which, as at the sudden moon, I held my breath, and thought ‘how bright!’ That guileless beauty in its noon, Compelling tribute of desires Ardent as day when Sirius reigns, Pure as the permeating fires That smoulder in the opal's veins. CANTO IV Love in Idleness PRELUDES I Honour and Desert O queen, awake to thy renown, Require what 'tis our wealth to give, And comprehend and wear the crown Of thy despised prerogative! I, who in manhood's name at length With glad songs come to abdicate The gross regality of strength, Must yet in this thy praise abate, That, through thine erring humbleness And disregard of thy degree, Mainly, has man been so much less Than fits his fellowship with thee. High thoughts had shaped the foolish brow, The coward had grasp'd the hero's sword, The vilest had been great, hadst thou, Just to thyself, been worth's reward. But lofty honours undersold Seller and buyer both disgrace; And favours that make folly bold Banish the light from virtue's face. II Love and Honour What man with baseness so content, Or sick with false conceit of right, As not to know that the element And inmost warmth of love's delight Is honour? Who'd not rather kiss A duchess than a milkmaid, prank The two in equal grace, which is Precedent Nature's obvious rank? Much rather, then, a woman deck'd With saintly honours, chaste and good, Whose thoughts celestial things affect, Whose eyes express her heavenly mood! Those lesser vaunts are dimm'd or lost Which plume her name or paint her lip, Extinct in the deep-glowing boast Of her angelic fellowship. III Valour misdirected ‘I'll hunt for dangers North and South, ‘To prove my love, which sloth maligns!’ What seems to say her rosy mouth? ‘I'm not convinced by proofs but signs.’ LOVE IN IDLENESS 1 What should I do? In such a wife Fortune had lavish'd all her store, And nothing now seem'd left for life But to deserve her more and more. To this I vow'd my life's whole scope; And Love said, ‘I forewarn you now, ‘The Maiden will fulfil your hope ‘Only as you fulfil your vow.’ 2 A promised service, (task for days), Was done this morning while she slept, With that full heart which thinks no praise Of vows which are not more than kept; But loftier work did love impose, And studious hours. Alas, for these, While she from all my thoughts arose Like Venus from the restless seas! 3 I conn'd a scheme, with mind elate: My Uncle's land would fall to me, My skill was much in school debate, My friends were strong in Salisbury; A place in Parliament once gain'd, Thro' saps first labour'd out of sight, Far loftier peaks were then attain'd With easy leaps from height to height; And that o'erwhelming honour paid, Or recognised, at least, in life, Which this most sweet and noble Maid Should yield to him who call'd her Wife. 4 I fix'd this rule: in Sarum Close To make two visits every week, The first to-day; and, save on those, I nought would do, think, read, or speak, Which did not help my settled will To earn the Statesman's proud applause. And now, forthwith, to mend my skill In ethics, politics, and laws, The Statesman's learning! Flush'd with power And pride of freshly-form'd resolve, I read Helvetius half-an-hour; But, halting in attempts to solve Why, more than all things else that be, A lady's grace hath force to move That sensitive appetency Of intellectual good, call'd love, Took Blackstone down, only to draw My swift-deriving thoughts ere long To love, which is the source of law, And, like a king, can do no wrong; Then open'd Hyde, where loyal hearts, With faith unpropp'd by precedent, Began to play rebellious parts. O, mighty stir that little meant! How dull the crude, plough'd fields of fact To me who trod the Elysian grove! How idle all heroic act By the least suffering of love! I could not read; so took my pen, And thus commenced, in form of notes, A Lecture for the Salisbury men, With due regard to Tory votes: ‘A road's a road, though worn to ruts; ‘They speed who travel straight therein; ‘But he who tacks and tries short cuts ‘Gets fools' praise and a broken shin—’ And here I stopp'd in sheer despair; But, what to-day was thus begun, I vow'd, up starting from my chair, To-morrow should indeed be done; So loosed my chafing thoughts from school, To play with fancy as they chose, And then, according to my rule, I dress'd, and came to Sarum Close. 5 Ah, that sweet laugh! Diviner sense Did Nature, forming her, inspire To omit the grosser elements, And make her all of air and fire! 6 To-morrow, Cowes Regatta fell: The Dean would like his girls to go, If I went too. ‘Most gladly.’ Well, I did but break a foolish vow! Unless Love's toil has love for prize, (And then he's Hercules), above All other contrarieties Is labour contrary to love. No fault of Love's, but nature's laws! And Love, in idleness, lies quick; For as the worm whose powers make pause, And swoon, through alteration sick, The soul, its wingless state dissolved, Awaits its nuptial life complete, All indolently self-convolved, Cocoon'd in silken fancies sweet. CANTO V The Queen's Room PRELUDES I Rejected ‘Perhaps she's dancing somewhere now!’ The thoughts of light and music wake Sharp jealousies, that grow and grow Till silence and the darkness ache. He sees her step, so proud and gay, Which, ere he spake, foretold despair; Thus did she look, on such a day, And such the fashion of her hair; And thus she stood, when, kneeling low, He took the bramble from her dress, And thus she laugh'd and talk'd, whose ‘No’ Was sweeter than another's ‘Yes.’ He feeds on thoughts that most deject; He impudently feigns her charms, So reverenced in his own respect, Dreadfully clasp'd by other arms; And turns, and puts his brows, that ache, Against the pillow where 'tis cold. If only now his heart would break! But, oh, how much a heart can hold. II Rachel You loved her, and would lie all night Thinking how beautiful she was, And what to do for her delight. Now both are bound with alien laws! Be patient; put your heart to school; Weep if you will, but not despair; The trust that nought goes wrong by rule Should ease this load the many bear. Love, if there's heav'n, shall meet his dues, Though here unmatch'd, or match'd amiss Meanwhile, the gentle cannot choose But learn to love the lips they kiss. Ne'er hurt the homely sister's ears With Rachel's beauties; secret be The lofty mind whose lonely tears Protest against mortality. III The Heart's Prophecies Be not amazed at life; 'tis still The mode of God with His elect Their hopes exactly to fulfil, In times and ways they least expect. THE QUEEN'S ROOM 1 There's nothing happier than the days In which young Love makes every thought Pure as a bride's blush, when she says ‘I will’ unto she knows not what; And lovers, on the love-lit globe, For love's sweet sake, walk yet aloof, And hear Time weave the marriage-robe, Attraction warp and reverence woof! 2 My Housekeeper, my Nurse of yore, Cried, as the latest carriage went, ‘Well, Mr. Felix, Sir, I'm sure ‘The morning's gone off excellent! ‘I never saw the show to pass ‘The ladies, in their fine fresh gowns, ‘So sweetly dancing on the grass, ‘To music with its ups and downs. ‘We'd such work, Sir, to clean the plate; ‘'Twas just the busy times of old. ‘The Queen's room, Sir, look'd quite like state. ‘Miss Smythe, when she went up, made bold ‘To peep into the Rose Boudoir, ‘And cried, “How charming! all quite new!” ‘And wonder'd who it could be for. ‘All but Miss Honor look'd in too. ‘But she's too proud to peep and pry. ‘None's like that sweet Miss Honor, Sir! ‘Excuse my humbleness, but I ‘Pray Heav'n you'll get a wife like her! ‘The Poor love dear Miss Honor's ways ‘Better than money. Mrs. Rouse, ‘Who ought to know a lady, says ‘No finer goes to Wilton House. ‘Miss Bagshaw thought that dreary room ‘Had kill'd old Mrs. Vaughan with fright; ‘She would not sleep in such a tomb ‘For all her host was worth a night! ‘Miss Fry, Sir, laugh'd; they talk'd the rest ‘In French; and French Sir's Greek to me. ‘But, though they smiled, and seem'd to jest, ‘No love was lost, for I could see ‘How serious-like Miss Honor was—’ ‘Well, Nurse, this is not my affair. ‘The ladies talk'd in French with cause. ‘Good-day; and thank you for your prayer.’ 3 I loiter'd through the vacant house, Soon to be hers; in one room stay'd, Of old my mother's. Here my vows Of endless thanks were oftenest paid. This room its first condition kept; For, on her road to Sarum Town, Therein an English Queen had slept, Before the Hurst was half-pull'd down. The pictured walls the place became: Here ran the Brook Anaurus, where Stout Jason bore the wrinkled dame Whom serving changed to Juno; there, Ixion's selfish hope, instead Of the nuptial goddess, clasp'd a cloud; And, here, translated Psyche fed Her gaze on Love, not disallow'd. 4 And in this chamber had she been, And into that she would not look, My Joy, my Vanity, my Queen, At whose dear name my pulses shook! To others how express at all My worship in that joyful shrine? I scarcely can myself recall What peace and ardour then were mine! And how more sweet than aught below, The daylight and its duties done, It felt to fold the hands, and so Relinquish all regards but one; To see her features in the dark; To lie and meditate once more The grace I did not fully mark, The tone I had not heard before; And from my pillow then to take Her notes, her picture, and her glove, Put there for joy when I should wake, And press them to the heart of love; And then to whisper ‘Wife!’ and pray To live so long as not to miss That unimaginable day Which farther seems the nearer 'tis; And still from joy's unfathom'd well To drink, in dreams, while on her brows Of innocence ineffable Blossom'd the laughing bridal rose. CANTO VI The Love-Letters PRELUDES I Love's Perversity How strange a thing a lover seems To animals that do not love! Lo, where he walks and talks in dreams, And flouts us with his Lady's glove; How foreign is the garb he wears; And how his great devotion mocks Our poor propriety, and scares The undevout with paradox! His soul, through scorn of worldly care, And great extremes of sweet and gall, And musing much on all that's fair, Grows witty and fantastical; He sobs his joy and sings his grief, And evermore finds such delight In simply picturing his relief, That 'plaining seems to cure his plight; He makes his sorrow, when there's none; His fancy blows both cold and hot; Next to the wish that she'll be won, His first hope is that she may not; He sues, yet deprecates consent; Would she be captured she must fly; She looks too happy and content, For whose least pleasure he would die. Oh, cruelty, she cannot care For one to whom she's always kind! He says he's nought, but, oh, despair, If he's not Jove to her fond mind! He's jealous if she pets a dove, She must be his with all her soul; Yet 'tis a postulate in love That part is greater than the whole; And all his apprehension's stress, When he's with her, regards her hair, Her hand, a ribbon of her dress, As if his life were only there; Because she's constant, he will change, And kindest glances coldly meet, And, all the time he seems so strange, His soul is fawning at her feet; Of smiles and simple heaven grown tired, He wickedly provokes her tears, And when she weeps, as he desired, Falls slain with ecstasies of fears; He blames her, though she has no fault, Except the folly to be his; He worships her, the more to exalt The profanation of a kiss; Health's his disease; he's never well But when his paleness shames her rose; His faith's a rock-built citadel, Its sign a flag that each way blows; His o'erfed fancy frets and fumes; And Love, in him, is fierce, like Hate, And ruffles his ambrosial plumes Against the bars of time and fate. II The Power of Love Samson the Mighty, Solomon The Wise, and Holy David all Must doff their crowns to Love, for none But fell as Love would scorn to fall! And what may fallen spirits win, When stripes and precepts cannot move? Only the sadness of all sin, When look'd at in the light of Love. THE LOVE-LETTERS 1 ‘You ask, Will admiration halt, ‘Should spots appear within my Sun? ‘Oh, how I wish I knew your fault, ‘For Love's tired gaze to rest upon! ‘Your graces, which have made me great, ‘Will I so loftily admire, ‘Yourself yourself shall emulate, ‘And be yourself your own desire. ‘I'll nobly mirror you too fair, ‘And, when you're false to me your glass, ‘What's wanting you'll by that repair, ‘So bring yourself through me to pass. ‘O Dearest, tell me how to prove ‘Goodwill which cannot be express'd; ‘The beneficial heart of love ‘Is labour in an idle breast. ‘Name in the world your chosen part, ‘And here I vow, with all the bent ‘And application of my heart ‘To give myself to your content. ‘Would you live on, home-worshipp'd, thus, ‘Not proudly high nor poorly low? ‘Indeed the lines are fall'n to us ‘In pleasant places! Be it so. ‘But would you others heav'nward move, ‘By sight not faith, while you they admire? ‘I'll help with zeal as I approve ‘That just and merciful desire. ‘High as the lonely moon to view ‘I'll lift your light; do you decree ‘Your place, I'll win it; for from you ‘Command inspires capacity. ‘Or, unseen, would you sway the world ‘More surely? Then in gracious rhyme ‘I'll raise your emblem, fair unfurl'd ‘With blessing in the breeze of time. ‘Faith removes mountains, much more love; ‘Let your contempt abolish me ‘If ought of your devisal prove ‘Too hard or high to do or be.’ 2 I ended. ‘From your Sweet-Heart, Sir,’ Said Nurse, ‘The Dean's man brings it down.’ I could have kiss'd both him and her! ‘Nurse, give him that, with half-a-crown.’ How beat my heart, how paused my breath. When with perversely fond delay, I broke the seal, that bore a wreath Of roses link'd with one of bay. 3 ‘I found your note. How very kind ‘To leave it there! I cannot tell ‘How pleased I was, or how you find ‘Words to express your thoughts so well. ‘The Girls are going to the Ball ‘At Wilton. If you can, do come; ‘And any day this week you call ‘Papa and I shall be at home. ‘You said to Mary once—I hope ‘In jest—that women should be vain: ‘On Saturday your friend (her Pope), ‘The Bishop dined with us again. ‘She put the question, if they ought? ‘He turn'd it cleverly away ‘(For giddy Mildred cried, she thought ‘We must), with “What we must we may.” ‘Dear papa laugh'd, and said 'twas sad ‘To think how vain his girls would be, ‘Above all Mary, now she had ‘Episcopal authority. ‘But I was very dull, dear friend, ‘And went upstairs at last, and cried. ‘Be sure to come to-day, or send ‘A rose-leaf kiss'd on either side. ‘Adieu! I am not well. Last night ‘My dreams were wild: I often woke, ‘The summer-lightning was so bright; ‘And when it flash'd I thought you spoke.’ CANTO VII The Revulsion PRELUDES I Joy and Use Can ought compared with wedlock be For use? But He who made the heart To use proportions joy. What He Has join'd let no man put apart. Sweet Order has its draught of bliss Graced with the pearl of God's consent, Ten times delightful in that 'tis Considerate and innocent. In vain Disorder grasps the cup; The pleasure's not enjoy'd but spilt, And, if he stoops to lick it up, It only tastes of earth and guilt. His sorry raptures rest destroys; To live, like comets, they must roam; On settled poles turn solid joys, And sunlike pleasures shine at home. II ‘She was Mine’ ‘Thy tears o'erprize thy loss! Thy wife, ‘In what was she particular? ‘Others of comely face and life, ‘Others as chaste and warm there are, ‘And when they speak they seem to sing; ‘Beyond her sex she was not wise; ‘And there is no more common thing ‘Than kindness in a woman's eyes. ‘Then wherefore weep so long and fast, ‘Why so exceedingly repine! ‘Say, how has thy Beloved surpass'd ‘So much all others?’ ‘She was mine.’ THE REVULSION 1 'Twas when the spousal time of May Hangs all the hedge with bridal wreaths, And air's so sweet the bosom gay Gives thanks for every breath it breathes; When like to like is gladly moved, And each thing joins in Spring's refrain, ‘Let those love now who never loved; ‘Let those who have loved love again;’ That I, in whom the sweet time wrought, Lay stretch'd within a lonely glade, Abandon'd to delicious thought, Beneath the softly twinkling shade. The leaves, all stirring, mimick'd well A neighbouring rush of rivers cold, And, as the sun or shadow fell, So these were green and those were gold; In dim recesses hyacinths droop'd, And breadths of primrose lit the air, Which, wandering through the woodland, stoop'd And gather'd perfumes here and there; Upon the spray the squirrel swung, And careless songsters, six or seven, Sang lofty songs the leaves among, Fit for their only listener, Heaven. I sigh'd, ‘Immeasurable bliss ‘Gains nothing by becoming more! ‘Millions have meaning; after this ‘Cyphers forget the integer.’ 2 And so I mused, till musing brought A dream that shook my house of clay, And, in my humbled heart, I thought, To me there yet may come a day With this the single vestige seen Of comfort, earthly or divine, My sorrow some time must have been Her portion, had it not been mine. Then I, who knew, from watching life, That blows foreseen are slow to fall, Rehearsed the losing of a wife, And faced its terrors each and all. The self-chastising fancy show'd The coffin with its ghastly breath; The innocent sweet face that owed None of its innocence to death; The lips that used to laugh; the knell That bade the world beware of mirth; The heartless and intolerable Indignity of ‘earth to earth;’ At morn remembering by degrees That she I dream'd about was dead; Love's still recurrent jubilees, The days that she was born, won, wed; The duties of my life the same, Their meaning for the feelings gone; Friendship impertinent, and fame Disgusting; and, more harrowing none, Small household troubles fall'n to me, As, ‘What time would I dine to-day?’ And, oh, how could I bear to see The noisy children at their play. Besides, where all things limp and halt, Could I go straight, should I alone Have kept my love without default Pitch'd at the true and heavenly tone? The festal-day might come to mind That miss'd the gift which more endears; The hour which might have been more kind, And now less fertile in vain tears; The good of common intercourse, For daintier pleasures, then despised, Now with what passionate remorse, What poignancy of hunger prized! The little wrong, now greatly rued, Which no repentance now could right; And love, in disbelieving mood, Deserting his celestial height. Withal to know, God's love sent grief To make me less the world's, and more Meek-hearted: ah, the sick relief! Why bow'd I not my heart before? 3 ‘What,’ I exclaimed, with chill alarm, ‘If this fantastic horror shows ‘The feature of an actual harm!’ And, coming straight to Sarum Close, As one who dreams his wife is dead, And cannot in his slumber weep, And moans upon his wretched bed, And wakes, and finds her there asleep, And laughs and sighs, so I, not less Relieved, beheld, with blissful start, The light and happy loveliness Which lay so heavy on my heart. CANTO VIII The Koh-i-noor PRELUDES I In Love If he's capricious she'll be so, But, if his duties constant are, She lets her loving favour glow As steady as a tropic star; Appears there nought for which to weep, She'll weep for nought, for his dear sake; She clasps her sister in her sleep; Her love in dreams is most awake. Her soul, that once with pleasure shook, Did any eyes her beauty own, Now wonders how they dare to look On what belongs to him alone; The indignity of taking gifts Exhilarates her loving breast; A rapture of submission lifts Her life into celestial rest; There's nothing left of what she was; Back to the babe the woman dies, And all the wisdom that she has Is to love him for being wise. She's confident because she fears, And, though discreet when he's away, If none but her dear despot hears, She prattles like a child at play. Perchance, when all her praise is said, He tells the news, a battle won, On either side ten thousand dead. ‘Alas!’ she says; but, if 'twere known, She thinks, ‘He's looking on my face! ‘I am his joy; whate'er I do, ‘He sees such time-contenting grace ‘In that, he'd have me always so!’ And, evermore, for either's sake, To the sweet folly of the dove, She joins the cunning of the snake, To rivet and exalt his love; Her mode of candour is deceit; And what she thinks from what she'll say, (Although I'll never call her cheat), Lies far as Scotland from Cathay. Without his knowledge he was won; Against his nature kept devout; She'll never tell him how 'twas done, And he will never find it out. If, sudden, he suspects her wiles, And hears her forging chain and trap, And looks, she sits in simple smiles, Her two hands lying in her lap. Her secret (privilege of the Bard, Whose fancy is of either sex), Is mine; but let the darkness guard Myst'ries that light would more perplex! II Love Thinking What lifts her in my thought so far Beyond all else? Let Love not err! 'Tis that which all right women are, But which I'll know in none but her. She is to me the only Ark Of that high mystery which locks The lips of joy, or speaks in dark Enigmas and in paradox; That potent charm, which none can fly, Nor would, which makes me bond and free, Nor can I tell if first 'twas I Chose it, or it elected me; Which, when I look intentest, lo, Cheats most mine eyes, albeit my heart, Content to feel and not to know, Perceives it all in every part; I kiss its cheek; its life divine Exhales from its resplendent shroud; Ixion's fate reversed is mine, Authentic Juno seems a cloud; I feel a blessed warmth, I see A bright circumference of rays, But darkness, where the sun should be, Fills admiration with amaze; And when, for joy's relief, I think To fathom with the line of thought The well from which I, blissful, drink, The spring's so deep I come to nought. III The Kiss ‘I saw you take his kiss!’ ‘'Tis true.’ ‘O, modesty!’ ‘'Twas strictly kept: ‘He thought me asleep; at least, I knew ‘He thought I thought he thought I slept.’ THE KOH-I-NOOR 1 ‘Be man's hard virtues highly wrought, ‘But let my gentle Mistress be, ‘In every look, word, deed, and thought, ‘Nothing but sweet and womanly! ‘Her virtues please my virtuous mood, ‘But what at all times I admire ‘Is, not that she is wise or good, ‘But just the thing which I desire. ‘With versatility to sing ‘The theme of love to any strain, ‘If oft'nest she is anything, ‘Be it careless, talkative, and vain. ‘That seems in her supremest grace ‘Which, virtue or not, apprises me ‘That my familiar thoughts embrace ‘Unfathomable mystery.’ 2 I answer'd thus; for she desired To know what mind I most approved; Partly to learn what she inquired, Partly to get the praise she loved. 3 I praised her, but no praise could fill The depths of her desire to please, Though dull to others as a Will To them that have no legacies. The more I praised the more she shone, Her eyes incredulously bright, And all her happy beauty blown Beneath the beams of my delight. Sweet rivalry was thus begot; By turns, my speech, in passion's style, With flatteries the truth o'ershot, And she surpass'd them with her smile. 4 ‘You have my heart so sweetly seized, ‘And I confess, nay, 'tis my pride ‘That I'm with you so solely pleased, ‘That, if I'm pleased with aught beside, ‘As music, or the month of June, ‘My friend's devotion, or his wit, ‘A rose, a rainbow, or the moon, ‘It is that you illustrate it. ‘All these are parts, you are the whole; ‘You fit the taste for Paradise, ‘To which your charms draw up the soul ‘As turning spirals draw the eyes. ‘Nature to you was more than kind; ‘'Twas fond perversity to dress ‘So much simplicity of mind ‘In such a pomp of loveliness! ‘But, praising you, the fancy deft ‘Flies wide, and lets the quarry stray, ‘And, when all's said, there's something left, ‘And that's the thing I meant to say.’ ‘Dear Felix!’ ‘Sweet, my Love!’ But there Was Aunt Maude's noisy ring and knock! ‘Stay, Felix; you have caught my hair. ‘Stoop! Thank you!’ ‘May I have that lock?’ ‘Not now. Good morning, Aunt!’ ‘Why, Puss, ‘You look magnificent to-day.’ ‘Here's Felix, Aunt.’ ‘Fox and green goose! ‘Who handsome gets should handsome pay!’ ‘Aunt, you are friends!’ ‘Ah, to be sure! ‘Good morning! Go on flattering, Sir; ‘A woman, like the Koh-i-noor, ‘Mounts to the price that's put on her.’ CANTO IX The Friends PRELUDES I The Nursling of Civility Lo, how the woman once was woo'd: Forth leapt the savage from his lair, And fell'd her, and to nuptials rude He dragg'd her, bleeding, by the hair. From that to Chloe's dainty wiles And Portia's dignified consent, What distance! But these Pagan styles How far below Time's fair intent! Siegfried sued Kriemhild. Sweeter life Could Love's self covet? Yet 'tis sung In what rough sort he chid his wife For want of curb upon her tongue! Shall Love, where last I leave him, halt? Nay; none can fancy or foresee To how strange bliss may time exalt This nursling of civility. II The Foreign Land A woman is a foreign land, Of which, though there he settle young, A man will ne'er quite understand The customs, politics, and tongue. The foolish hie them post-haste through, See fashions odd, and prospects fair, Learn of the language, ‘How d'ye do,’ And go and brag they have been there. The most for leave to trade apply, For once, at Empire's seat, her heart, Then get what knowledge ear and eye Glean chancewise in the life-long mart. And certain others, few and fit, Attach them to the Court, and see The Country's best, its accent hit, And partly sound its polity. III Disappointment ‘The bliss which woman's charms bespeak, ‘I've sought in many, found in none!’ ‘In many 'tis in vain you seek ‘What can be found in only one.’ THE FRIENDS 1 Frank's long, dull letter, lying by The gay sash from Honoria's waist, Reproach'd me; passion spared a sigh For friendship without fault disgraced. How should I greet him? how pretend I felt the love he once inspired? Time was when either, in his friend, His own deserts with joy admired; We took one side in school-debate, Like hopes pursued with equal thirst, Were even-bracketed by Fate, Twin-Wranglers, seventh from the First; And either loved a lady's laugh More than all music; he and I Were perfect in the pleasant half Of universal charity. 2 From pride of likeness thus I loved Him, and he me, till love begot The lowliness which now approved Nothing but that which I was not. Blest was the pride of feeling so Subjected to a girl's soft reign. She was my vanity, and, oh, All other vanities how vain! 3 Frank follow'd in his letter's track, And set my guilty heart at ease By echoing my excuses back With just the same apologies. So he had slighted me as well! Nor was my mind disburthen'd less When what I sought excuse to tell He of himself did first confess. 4 Each, rapturous, praised his lady's worth; He eloquently thus: ‘Her face ‘Is the summ'd sweetness of the earth, ‘Her soul the glass of heaven's grace, ‘To which she leads me by the hand; ‘Or, briefly all the truth to say ‘To you, who briefly understand, ‘She is both heaven and the way. ‘Displeasures and resentments pass ‘Athwart her charitable eyes ‘More fleetingly than breath from glass, ‘Or truth from foolish memories; ‘Her heart's so touch'd with others' woes ‘She has no need of chastisement; ‘Her gentle life's conditions close, ‘Like God's commandments, with content, ‘And make an aspect calm and gay, ‘Where sweet affections come and go, ‘Till all who see her, smile and say, ‘How fair, and happy that she's so! ‘She is so lovely, true, and pure, ‘Her virtue virtue so endears, ‘That often, when I think of her, ‘Life's meanness fills mine eyes with tears—’ ‘You paint Miss Churchill! Pray go on—’ ‘She's perfect, and, if joy was much ‘To think her nature's paragon, ‘'Tis more that there's another such!’ 5 Praising and paying back their praise With rapturous hearts, t'ward Sarum Spire We walk'd, in evening's golden haze, Friendship from passion stealing fire. In joy's crown danced the feather jest, And, parting by the Deanery door, Clasp'd hands, less shy than words, confess'd We had not been true friends before. CANTO X The Epitaph PRELUDES I Frost in Harvest The lover who, across a gulf Of ceremony, views his Love, And dares not yet address herself, Pays worship to her stolen glove. The gulf o'erleapt, the lover wed, It happens oft, (let truth be told), The halo leaves the sacred head, Respect grows lax, and worship cold, And all love's May-day promising, Like song of birds before they pair, Or flush of flowers in boastful Spring, Dies out, and leaves the Summer bare Yet should a man, it seems to me, Honour what honourable is, For some more honourable plea Than only that it is not his. The gentle wife, who decks his board And makes his day to have no night, Whose wishes wait upon her lord, Who finds her own in his delight, Is she another now than she Who, mistress of her maiden charms, At his wild prayer, incredibly Committed them to his proud arms? Unless her choice of him's a slur Which makes her proper credit dim, He never enough can honour her Who past all speech has honour'd him. II Felicity To marry her and take her home! The poet, painting pureness, tells Of lilies; figures power by Rome; And each thing shows by something else! But through the songs of poets look, And who so lucky to have found In universal nature's book A likeness for a life so crown'd! Here they speak best who best express Their inability to speak, And none are strong, but who confess With happy skill that they are weak. III Marriage Indissoluble ‘In heaven none marry.’ Grant the most Which may by this dark word be meant, Who shall forbid the eternal boast ‘I kiss'd, and kiss'd with her consent!’ If here, to Love, past favour is A present boast, delight, and chain, What lacks of honour, bond, and bliss, Where Now and Then are no more twain! THE EPITAPH 1 ‘At Church, in twelve hours more, we meet! ‘This, Dearest, is our last farewell.’ ‘Oh, Felix, do you love me?’ ‘Sweet, ‘Why do you ask?’ ‘I cannot tell.’ 2 And was it no vain fantasy That raised me from the earth with pride? Should I to-morrow verily Be Bridegroom, and Honoria Bride? Should I, in simple fact, henceforth Live unconditionally lord Of her whose smile for brightest worth Seem'd all too bountiful reward? Incredible life's promise seem'd, Or, credible, for life too great; Love his own deity blasphemed, And doff'd at last his heavenly state. What law, if man could mount so high, To further insolence set bars, And kept the chaste moon in the sky, And bade him not tread out the stars! 3 Patience and hope had parted truce, And, sun-like, Love obscured his ray With dazzling mists, driven up profuse Before his own triumphant way. I thought with prayer how Jacob paid The patient price of Rachel; then, Of that calm grace Tobias said, And Sarah's innocent ‘Amen.’ Without avail! O'erwhelming wealth, The wondrous gift of God so near, Which should have been delight and health Made heart and spirit sick and sere. Until at last the soul of love, That recks not of its own delight, Awoke and bade the mists remove, And then once more I breathed aright; And I rehears'd my marriage vow, And swore her welfare to prefer To all things, and for aye as now To live, not for myself, but her. Forth, from the glittering spirit's peace And gaiety ineffable, Stream'd to the heart delight and ease, As from an overflowing well; And, orderly deriving thence Its pleasure perfect and allow'd, Bright with the spirit shone the sense, As with the sun a fleecy cloud. If now to part with her could make, Her pleasure greater, sorrow less, I for my epitaph would take ‘To serve seem'd more than to possess.’ And I perceiv'd, (the vision sweet Dimming with happy dew mine eyes), That love and joy are torches lit From altar-fires of sacrifice. 4 Across the sky the daylight crept, And birds grew garrulous in the grove, And on my marriage-morn I slept A soft sleep, undisturb'd by love. CANTO XI The Wedding PRELUDES I Platonic Love Right art thou who wouldst rather be A doorkeeper in Love's fair house, Than lead the wretched revelry Where fools at swinish troughs carouse. But do not boast of being least; And if to kiss thy Mistress' skirt Amaze thy brain, scorn not the Priest Whom greater honours do not hurt. Stand off and gaze, if more than this Be more than thou canst understand, Revering him whose power of bliss, Angelic, dares to seize her hand, Or whose seraphic love makes flight To the apprehension of her lips; And think, the sun of such delight From thine own darkness takes eclipse. And, wouldst thou to the same aspire, This is the art thou must employ, Live greatly; so shalt thou acquire Unknown capacities of joy. II A Demonstration Nature, with endless being rife, Parts each thing into ‘him’ and ‘her,’ And, in the arithmetic of life, The smallest unit is a pair; And thus, oh, strange, sweet half of me, If I confess a loftier flame, If more I love high Heaven than thee, I more than love thee, thee I am; And, if the world's not built of lies, Nor all a cheat the Gospel tells, If that which from the dead shall rise Be I indeed, not something else, There's no position more secure In reason or in faith than this, That those conditions must endure, Which, wanting, I myself should miss. III The Symbol As if I chafed the sparks from glass, And said, ‘It lightens,’ hitherto The songs I've made of love may pass For all but for proportion true; But likeness and proportion both Now fail, as if a child in glee, Catching the flakes of the salt froth, Cried, ‘Look, my mother, here's the sea.’ Yet, by the help of what's so weak, But not diverse, to those who know, And only unto those I speak, May far-inferring fancy show Love's living sea by coasts uncurb'd, Its depth, its mystery, and its might, Its indignation if disturb'd, The glittering peace of its delight. IV Constancy rewarded I vow'd unvarying faith, and she, To whom in full I pay that vow, Rewards me with variety Which men who change can never know. THE WEDDING 1 Life smitten with a feverish chill, The brain too tired to understand, In apathy of heart and will, I took the woman from the hand Of him who stood for God, and heard Of Christ, and of the Church his Bride; The Feast, by presence of the Lord And his first Wonder, beautified; The mystic sense to Christian men; The bonds in innocency made, And gravely to be enter'd then For children, godliness, and aid, And honour'd, and kept free from smirch; And how a man must love his wife No less than Christ did love His Church, If need be, giving her his life; And, vowing then the mutual vow, The tongue spoke, but intention slept. 'Tis well for us Heaven asks not how We take this oath, but how 'tis kept. 2 O, bold seal of a bashful bond, Which makes the marriage-day to be, To those before it and beyond, An iceberg in an Indian sea! 3 ‘Now, while she's changing,’ said the Dean, ‘Her bridal for her travelling dress, ‘I'll preach allegiance to your queen! ‘Preaching's the thing which I profess; ‘And one more minute's mine! You know ‘I've paid my girl a father's debt, ‘And this last charge is all I owe. ‘She's your's; but I love more than yet ‘You can; such fondness only wakes ‘When time has raised the heart above ‘The prejudice of youth, which makes ‘Beauty conditional to love. ‘Prepare to meet the weak alarms ‘Of novel nearness: recollect ‘The eye which magnifies her charms ‘Is microscopic for defect. ‘Fear comes at first; but soon, rejoiced, ‘You'll find your strong and tender loves, ‘Like holy rocks by Druids poised, ‘The least force shakes, but none removes. ‘Her strength is your esteem; beware ‘Of finding fault; her will's unnerv'd ‘By blame; from you 'twould be despair; ‘But praise that is not quite deserv'd ‘Will all her noble nature move ‘To make your utmost wishes true. ‘Yet think, while mending thus your Love, ‘Of matching her ideal too! ‘The death of nuptial joy is sloth: ‘To keep your mistress in your wife, ‘Keep to the very height your oath, ‘And honour her with arduous life. ‘Lastly, no personal reverence doff. ‘Life's all externals unto those ‘Who pluck the blushing petals off, ‘To find the secret of the rose.— ‘How long she's tarrying! Green's Hotel ‘I'm sure you'll like. The charge is fair, ‘The wines good. I remember well ‘I stay'd once, with her Mother, there. ‘A tender conscience of her vow ‘That Mother had! She's so like her!’ But Mrs. Fife, much flurried, now Whisper'd, ‘Miss Honor's ready, Sir.’ 4 Whirl'd off at last, for speech I sought, To keep shy Love in countenance; But, whilst I vainly tax'd my thought, Her voice deliver'd mine from trance: ‘Look, is not this a pretty shawl, ‘Aunt's parting gift.’ ‘She's always kind,’ ‘The new wing spoils Sir John's old Hall: ‘You'll see it, if you pull the blind.’ 5 I drew the silk: in heaven the night Was dawning; lovely Venus shone, In languishment of tearful light, Swathed by the red breath of the sun. CANTO XII Husband and Wife PRELUDES I The Married Lover Why, having won her, do I woo? Because her spirit's vestal grace Provokes me always to pursue, But, spirit-like, eludes embrace; Because her womanhood is such That, as on court-days subjects kiss The Queen's hand, yet so near a touch Affirms no mean familiarness, Nay, rather marks more fair the height Which can with safety so neglect To dread, as lower ladies might, That grace could meet with disrespect, Thus she with happy favour feeds Allegiance from a love so high That thence no false conceit proceeds Of difference bridged, or state put by; Because, although in act and word As lowly as a wife can be, Her manners, when they call me lord, Remind me 'tis by courtesy; Not with her least consent of will, Which would my proud affection hurt, But by the noble style that still Imputes an unattain'd desert; Because her gay and lofty brows, When all is won which hope can ask, Reflect a light of hopeless snows That bright in virgin ether bask; Because, though free of the outer court I am, this Temple keeps its shrine Sacred to Heaven; because, in short, She's not and never can be mine. II The Amaranth Feasts satiate; stars distress with height; Friendship means well, but misses reach, And wearies in its best delight Vex'd with the vanities of speech; Too long regarded, roses even Afflict the mind with fond unrest; And to converse direct with Heaven Is oft a labour in the breast; Whate'er the up-looking soul admires, Whate'er the senses' banquet be, Fatigues at last with vain desires, Or sickens by satiety; But truly my delight was more In her to whom I'm bound for aye Yesterday than the day before, And more to-day than yesterday. HUSBAND AND WIFE 1 I, while the shop-girl fitted on The sand-shoes, look'd where, down the bay, The sea glow'd with a shrouded sun. ‘I'm ready, Felix; will you pay?’ That was my first expense for this Sweet Stranger, now my three days' Wife. How light the touches are that kiss The music from the chords of life! 2 Her feet, by half-a-mile of sea, In spotless sand left shapely prints; With agates, then, she loaded me; (The lapidary call'd them flints); Then, at her wish, I hail'd a boat, To take her to the ships-of-war, At anchor, each a lazy mote Black in the brilliance, miles from shore. 3 The morning breeze the canvas fill'd, Lifting us o'er the bright-ridged gulf, And every lurch my darling thrill'd With light fear smiling at itself; And, dashing past the ‘Arrogant,’ Asleep upon the restless wave, After its cruise in the Levant, We reach'd the ‘Wolf,’ and signal gave For help to board: with caution meet, My bride was placed within the chair, The red flag wrapp'd about her feet, And so swung laughing through the air. 4 ‘Look, Love,’ she said, ‘there's Frederick Graham, ‘My cousin, whom you met, you know.’ And seeing us, the brave man came, And made his frank and courteous bow, And gave my hand a sailor's shake, And said, ‘You ask'd me to the Hurst: ‘I never thought my luck would make ‘Your wife and you my guests the first.’ And Honor, cruel, ‘Nor did we: ‘Have you not lately changed your ship?’ ‘Yes: I'm Commander, now,’ said he, With a slight quiver of the lip. We saw the vessel, shown with pride; Took luncheon; I must eat his salt! Parting he said, (I fear my bride Found him unselfish to a fault), His wish, he saw, had come to pass, (And so, indeed, her face express'd), That that should be, whatever 'twas, Which made his Cousin happiest. We left him looking from above; Rich bankrupt! for he could afford To say most proudly that his love Was virtue and its own reward. But others loved as well as he, (Thought I, half-anger'd), and if fate, Unfair, had only fashion'd me As hapless, I had been as great. 5 As souls, ambitious, but low-born, If raised past hope by luck or wit, All pride of place will proudly scorn, And live as they'd been used to it, So we two wore our strange estate: Familiar, unaffected, free, We talk'd, until the dusk grew late, Of this and that; but, after tea, As doubtful if a lot so sweet As ours was ours in very sooth, Like children, to promote conceit, We feign'd that it was not the truth; And she assumed the maiden coy, And I adored remorseless charms, And then we clapp'd our hands for joy, And ran into each other's arms. THE EPILOGUE 1 ‘Ah, dearest Wife, a fresh-lit fire ‘Sends forth to heaven great shows of fume, ‘And watchers, far away, admire; ‘But when the flames their power assume, ‘The more they burn the less they show, ‘The clouds no longer smirch the sky, ‘And then the flames intensest glow ‘When far-off watchers think they die. ‘The fumes of early love my verse ‘Has figured—’ ‘You must paint the flame!’ ‘'Twould merit the Promethean curse! ‘But now, Sweet, for your praise and blame.’ ‘You speak too boldly; veils are due ‘To women's feelings.’ ‘Fear not this! ‘Women will vow I say not true, ‘And men believe the lips they kiss.’ ‘I did not call you “Dear” or “Love,” ‘I think, till after Frank was born.’ ‘That fault I cannot well remove; ‘The rhymes’—but Frank now blew his horn, And Walter bark'd, on hands and knees, At Baby in the mignonette, And all made, full-cry, for the trees Where Felix and his Wife were set. Again disturb'd, (crickets have cares!) True to their annual use they rose, To offer thanks at Evening Prayers In three times sacred Sarum Close. 2 Passing, they left a gift of wine At Widow Neale's. Her daughter said: ‘O, Ma'am, she's sinking! For a sign, ‘She cried just now, of him that's dead, ‘“Mary, he's somewhere close above, ‘“Weeping and wailing his dead wife, ‘“With forceful prayers and fatal love ‘“Conjuring me to come to life. ‘“A spirit is terrible though dear! ‘“It comes by night, and sucks my breath, ‘“And draws me with desire and fear.” ‘Ah, Ma'am, she'll soon be his in death!’ 3 Vaughan, when his kind Wife's eyes were dry, Said, ‘This thought crosses me, my Dove; ‘If Heaven should proffer, when we die, ‘Some unconceiv'd, superior love, ‘How take the exchange without despair, ‘Without worse folly how refuse?’ But she, who, wise as she was fair, For subtle doubts had simple clues, Said, ‘Custom sanctifies, and faith ‘Is more than joy: ah, how desire ‘In any heaven a different path, ‘Though, found at first, it had been higher? ‘Yet love makes death a dreadful thought! ‘Felix, at what a price we live!’ But present pleasures soon forgot The future's dread alternative; For, as became the festal time, He cheer'd her heart with tender praise, And speeches wanting only rhyme To make them like his winged lays. He discommended girlhood. ‘What ‘For sweetness like the ten-years' wife, ‘Whose customary love is not ‘Her passion, or her play, but life? ‘With beauties so maturely fair, ‘Affecting, mild, and manifold, ‘May girlish charms no more compare ‘Than apples green with apples gold. ‘Ah, still unpraised Honoria, Heaven, ‘When you into my arms it gave, ‘Left nought hereafter to be given ‘But grace to feel the good I have.’ 4 Her own and manhood's modesty Made dumb her love, but, on their road, His hand in hers felt soft reply, And like rejoinder fond bestow'd; And, when the carriage set them down, ‘How strange,’ said he, ‘'twould seem to meet, ‘When pacing, as we now this town, ‘A Florence or a Lisbon Street, ‘That Laura or that Catherine, who, ‘In the remote, romantic years, ‘From Petrarch or Camoens drew ‘Their songs and their immortal tears!’ But here their converse had its end; For, crossing the Cathedral Lawn, There came an ancient college-friend, Who, introduced to Mrs. Vaughan, Lifted his hat, and bow'd and smiled, And fill'd her kind large eyes with joy, By patting on the cheek her child, With, ‘Is he yours, this handsome boy?’ THE VICTORIES OF LOVE “Da quod amo: amo enim, et hoc tu dedisti.” St. Augustine. BOOK I I FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM Mother, I smile at your alarms! I own, indeed, my Cousin's charms, But, like all nursery maladies, Love is not badly taken twice. Have you forgotten Charlotte Hayes, My playmate in the pleasant days At Knatchley, and her sister, Anne, The twins, so made on the same plan, That one wore blue, the other white, To mark them to their father's sight; And how, at Knatchley harvesting, You bade me kiss her in the ring, Like Anne and all the others? You, That never of my sickness knew, Will laugh, yet had I the disease, And gravely, if the signs are these: As, ere the Spring has any power, The almond branch all turns to flower, Though not a leaf is out, so she The bloom of life provoked in me; And, hard till then and selfish, I Was thenceforth nought but sanctity And service: life was mere delight In being wholly good and right, As she was; just, without a slur; Honouring myself no less than her; Obeying, in the loneliest place, Ev'n to the slightest gesture, grace Assured that one so fair, so true, He only served that was so too. For me, hence weak towards the weak, No more the unnested blackbird's shriek Startled the light-leaved wood; on high Wander'd the gadding butterfly, Unscared by my flung cap; the bee, Rifling the hollyhock in glee, Was no more trapp'd with his own flower, And for his honey slain. Her power, From great things even to the grass Through which the unfenced footways pass, Was law, and that which keeps the law, Cherubic gaiety and awe; Day was her doing, and the lark Had reason for his song; the dark In anagram innumerous spelt Her name with stars that throbb'd and felt; 'Twas the sad summit of delight To wake and weep for her at night; She turn'd to triumph or to shame The strife of every childish game; The heart would come into my throat At rosebuds; howsoe'er remote, In opposition or consent, Each thing, or person, or event, Or seeming neutral howsoe'er, All, in the live, electric air, Awoke, took aspect, and confess'd In her a centre of unrest, Yea, stocks and stones within me bred Anxieties of joy and dread. O, bright apocalyptic sky O'erarching childhood! Far and nigh Mystery and obscuration none, Yet nowhere any moon or sun! What reason for these sighs? What hope, Daunting with its audacious scope The disconcerted heart, affects These ceremonies and respects? Why stratagems in everything? Why, why not kiss her in the ring? 'Tis nothing strange that warriors bold, Whose fierce, forecasting eyes behold The city they desire to sack, Humbly begin their proud attack By delving ditches two miles off, Aware how the fair place would scoff At hasty wooing; but, O child, Why thus approach thy playmate mild? One morning, when it flush'd my thought That, what in me such wonder wrought Was call'd, in men and women, love, And, sick with vanity thereof, I, saying loud, ‘I love her,’ told My secret to myself, behold A crisis in my mystery! For, suddenly, I seem'd to be Whirl'd round, and bound with showers of threads As when the furious spider sheds Captivity upon the fly To still his buzzing till he die; Only, with me, the bonds that flew, Enfolding, thrill'd me through and through With bliss beyond aught heaven can have And pride to dream myself her slave. A long, green slip of wilder'd land, With Knatchley Wood on either hand, Sunder'd our home from hers. This day Glad was I as I went her way. I stretch'd my arms to the sky, and sprang O'er the elastic sod, and sang ‘I love her, love her!’ to an air Which with the words came then and there; And even now, when I would know All was not always dull and low, I mind me awhile of the sweet strain Love taught me in that lonely lane. Such glories fade, with no more mark Than when the sunset dies to dark. They pass, the rapture and the grace Ineffable, their only trace A heart which, having felt no less Than pure and perfect happiness, Is duly dainty of delight; A patient, poignant appetite For pleasures that exceed so much The poor things which the world calls such, That, when these lure it, then you may The lion with a wisp of hay. That Charlotte, whom we scarcely knew From Anne but by her ribbons blue, Was loved, Anne less than look'd at, shows That liking still by favour goes! This Love is a Divinity, And holds his high election free Of human merit; or let's say, A child by ladies call'd to play, But careless of their becks and wiles, Till, seeing one who sits and smiles Like any else, yet only charms, He cries to come into her arms. Then, for my Cousins, fear me not! None ever loved because he ought. Fatal were else this graceful house, So full of light from ladies' brows. There's Mary; Heaven in her appears Like sunshine through the shower's bright tears; Mildred's of Earth, yet happier far Than most men's thoughts of Heaven are; But, for Honoria, Heaven and Earth Seal'd amity in her sweet birth. The noble Girl! With whom she talks She knights first with her smile; she walks, Stands, dances, to such sweet effect, Alone she seems to move erect. The brightest and the chastest brow Rules o'er a cheek which seems to show That love, as a mere vague suspense Of apprehensive innocence, Perturbs her heart; love without aim Or object, like the sunlit flame That in the Vestals' Temple glow'd, Without the image of a god. And this simplicity most pure She sets off with no less allure Of culture, subtly skill'd to raise The power, the pride, and mutual praise Of human personality Above the common sort so high, It makes such homely souls as mine Marvel how brightly life may shine. How you would love her! Even in dress She makes the common mode express New knowledge of what's fit so well 'Tis virtue gaily visible! Nay, but her silken sash to me Were more than all morality, Had not the old, sweet, feverous ill Left me the master of my will! So, Mother, feel at rest, and please To send my books on board. With these, When I go hence, all idle hours Shall help my pleasures and my powers. I've time, you know, to fill my post, And yet make up for schooling lost Through young sea-service. They all speak German with ease; and this, with Greek, (Which Dr. Churchill thought I knew,) And history, which I fail'd in too, Will stop a gap I somewhat dread, After the happy life I've led With these my friends; and sweet 'twill be To abridge the space from them to me. II FROM MRS. GRAHAM My Child, Honoria Churchill sways A double power through Charlotte Hayes. In minds to first-love's memory pledged The second Cupid's born full-fledged. I saw, and trembled for the day When you should see her beauty, gay And pure as apple-blooms, that show Outside a blush and inside snow, Her high and touching elegance Of order'd life as free as chance. Ah, haste from her bewitching side, No friend for you, far less a bride! But, warning from a hope so wild, I wrong you. Yet this know, my Child: He that but once too nearly hears The music of forefended spheres, Is thenceforth lonely, and for all His days like one who treads the Wall Of China, and, on this hand, sees Cities and their civilities, And, on the other, lions. Well, (Your rash reply I thus foretell,) Good is the knowledge of what's fair, Though bought with temporal despair! Yes, good for one, but not for two. Will it content a wife that you Should pine for love, in love's embrace, Through having known a happier grace; And break with inward sighs your rest, Because, though good, she's not the best? You would, you think, be just and kind, And keep your counsel! You will find You cannot such a secret keep; 'Twill out, like murder, in your sleep; A touch will tell it, though, for pride, She may her bitter knowledge hide; And, while she accepts love's make-believe, You'll twice despise what you'd deceive. I send the books. Dear Child, adieu! Tell me of all you are and do. I know, thank God, whate'er it be, 'Twill need no veil 'twixt you and me. III FROM FREDERICK The multitude of voices blythe Of early day, the hissing scythe Across the dew drawn and withdrawn, The noisy peacock on the lawn, These, and the sun's eye-gladding gleam, This morning, chased the sweetest dream That e'er shed penitential grace On life's forgetful commonplace; Yet 'twas no sweeter than the spell To which I woke to say farewell. Noon finds me many a mile removed From her who must not be beloved; And us the waste sea soon shall part, Heaving for aye, without a heart! Mother, what need to warn me so? I love Miss Churchill? Ah, no, no. I view, enchanted, from afar, And love her as I love a star, For, not to speak of colder fear, Which keeps my fancy calm, I hear, Under her life's gay progress hurl'd, The wheels of the preponderant world, Set sharp with swords that fool to slay Who blunders from a poor byway, To covet beauty with a crown Of earthly blessing added on; And she's so much, it seems to me, Beyond all women womanly, I dread to think how he should fare Who came so near as to despair. IV FROM FREDERICK Yonder the sombre vessel rides Where my obscure condition hides. Waves scud to shore against the wind That flings the sprinkling surf behind; In port the bickering pennons show Which way the ships would gladly go; Through Edgecumb Park the rooted trees Are tossing, reckless, in the breeze; On top of Edgecumb's firm-set tower, As foils, not foibles, of its power, The light vanes do themselves adjust To every veering of the gust: By me alone may nought be given To guidance of the airs of heaven? In battle or peace, in calm or storm, Should I my daily task perform, Better a thousand times for love, Who should my secret soul reprove? Beholding one like her, a man Longs to lay down his life! How can Aught to itself seem thus enough, When I have so much need thereof? Blest in her place, blissful is she; And I, departing, seem to be Like the strange waif that comes to run A few days flaming near the sun, And carries back, through boundless night, Its lessening memory of light. Oh, my dear Mother, I confess To a deep grief of homelessness, Unfelt, save once, before. 'Tis years Since such a shower of girlish tears Disgraced me? But this wretched Inn, At Plymouth, is so full of din, Talkings and trampings to and fro. And then my ship, to which I go To-night, is no more home. I dread, As strange, the life I long have led; And as, when first I went to school, And found the horror of a rule Which only ask'd to be obey'd, I lay and wept, of dawn afraid, And thought, with bursting heart, of one Who, from her little, wayward son, Required obedience, but above Obedience still regarded love, So change I that enchanting place, The abode of innocence and grace And gaiety without reproof, For the black gun-deck's louring roof, Blind and inevitable law Which makes light duties burdens, awe Which is not reverence, laughters gain'd At cost of purities profaned, And whatsoever most may stir Remorseful passion towards her, Whom to behold is to depart From all defect of life and heart. But, Mother, I shall go on shore, And see my Cousin yet once more! 'Twere wild to hope for her, you say. l've torn and cast those words away. Surely there's hope! For life 'tis well Love without hope's impossible; So, if I love, it is that hope Is not outside the outer scope Of fancy. You speak truth: this hour I must resist, or lose the power. What! and, when some short months are o'er, Be not much other than before? Drop from the bright and virtuous sphere In which I'm held but while she's dear? For daily life's dull, senseless mood, Slay the fine nerves of gratitude And sweet allegiance, which I owe Whether the debt be weal or woe? Nay, Mother, I, forewarn'd, prefer To want for all in wanting her. For all? Love's best is not bereft Ever from him to whom is left The trust that God will not deceive His creature, fashion'd to believe The prophecies of pure desire. Not loss, not death, my love shall tire. A mystery does my heart foretell; Nor do I press the oracle For explanations. Leave me alone, And let in me love's will be done. V FROM FREDERICK Fashion'd by Heaven and by art So is she, that she makes the heart Ache and o'erflow with tears, that grace So lovely fair should have for place, (Deeming itself at home the while,) The unworthy earth! To see her smile Amid this waste of pain and sin, As only knowing the heaven within, Is sweet, and does for pity stir Passion to be her minister: Wherefore last night I lay awake, And said, ‘Ah, Lord, for Thy love's sake, Give not this darling child of Thine To care less reverent than mine!’ And, as true faith was in my word, I trust, I trust that I was heard. The waves, this morning, sped to land, And shouted hoarse to touch the strand, Where Spring, that goes not out to sea, Lay laughing in her lovely glee; And, so, my life was sunlit spray And tumult, as, once more to-day, For long farewell did I draw near My Cousin, desperately dear. Faint, fierce, the truth that hope was none Gleam'd like the lightning in the sun; Yet hope I had, and joy thereof. The father of love is hope, (though love Lives orphan'd on, when hope is dead,) And, out of my immediate dread And crisis of the coming hour, Did hope itself draw sudden power. So the still brooding storm, in Spring, Makes all the birds begin to sing. Mother, your foresight did not err: I've lost the world, and not won her. And yet, ah, laugh not, when you think What cup of life I sought to drink! The bold, said I, have climb'd to bliss Absurd, impossible, as this, With nought to help them but so great A heart it fascinates their fate. If ever Heaven heard man's desire, Mine, being made of altar-fire, Must come to pass, and it will be That she will wait, when she shall see, This evening, how I go to get, By means unknown, I know not yet Quite what, but ground whereon to stand, And plead more plainly for her hand! And so I raved, and cast in hope A superstitious horoscope! And still, though something in her face Portended ‘No!’ with such a grace It burthen'd me with thankfulness, Nothing was credible but ‘Yes.’ Therefore, through time's close pressure bold, I praised myself, and boastful told My deeds at Acre; strain'd the chance I had of honour and advance In war to come; and would not see Sad silence meant, ‘What's this to me.’ When half my precious hour was gone, She rose to greet a Mr. Vaughan; And, as the image of the moon Breaks up, within some still lagoon That feels the soft wind suddenly, Or tide fresh flowing from the sea, And turns to giddy flames that go Over the water to and fro, Thus, when he took her hand to-night, Her lovely gravity of light Was scatter'd into many smiles And flattering weakness. Hope beguiles No more my heart, dear Mother. He, By jealous looks, o'erhonour'd me. With nought to do, and fondly fain To hear her singing once again, I stay'd, and turn'd her music o'er; Then came she with me to the door. ‘Dearest Honoria,’ I said, (By my despair familiar made,) ‘Heaven bless you!’ Oh, to have back then stepp'd And fallen upon her neck, and wept, And said, ‘My friend, I owe you all ‘I am, and have, and hope for. Call ‘For some poor service; let me prove ‘To you, or him here whom you love, ‘My duty. Any solemn task, ‘For life's whole course, is all I ask!’ Then she must surely have wept too, And said, ‘My friend, what can you do!’ And I should have replied, ‘I'll pray ‘For you and him three times a-day, ‘And, all day, morning, noon, and night, ‘My life shall be so high and right ‘That never Saint yet scaled the stairs ‘Of heaven with more availing prayers!’ But this (and, as good God shall bless Somehow my end, I'll do no less,) I had no right to speak. Oh, shame, So rich a love, so poor a claim! My Mother, now my only friend, Farewell. The school-books which you send I shall not want, and so return. Give them away, or sell, or burn. I'll write from Malta. Would I might But be your little Child to-night, And feel your arms about me fold, Against this loneliness and cold! VI FROM MRS. GRAHAM The folly of young girls! They doff Their pride to smooth success, and scoff At far more noble fire and might That woo them from the dust of fight! But, Frederick, now the storm is past, Your sky should not remain o'ercast. A sea-life's dull, and, oh, beware Of nourishing, for zest, despair. My Child, remember, you have twice Heartily loved; then why not thrice, Or ten times? But a wise man shuns To cry ‘All's over,’ more than once. I'll not say that a young man's soul Is scarcely measure of the whole Earthly and heavenly universe, To which he inveterately prefers The one beloved woman. Best Speak to the senses' interest, Which brooks no mystery nor delay: Frankly reflect, my Son, and say, Was there no secret hour, of those Pass'd at her side in Sarum Close, When, to your spirit's sick alarm, It seem'd that all her marvellous charm Was marvellously fled? Her grace Of voice, adornment, movement, face Was what already heart and eye Had ponder'd to satiety; And so the good of life was o'er, Until some laugh not heard before, Some novel fashion in her hair, Or style of putting back her chair, Restored the heavens. Gather thence The loss-consoling inference. Yet blame not beauty, which beguiles, With lovely motions and sweet smiles, Which while they please us pass away, The spirit to lofty thoughts that stay And lift the whole of after-life, Unless you take the vision to wife, Which then seems lost, or serves to slake Desire, as when a lovely lake Far off scarce fills the exulting eye Of one athirst, who comes thereby, And inappreciably sips The deep, with disappointed lips. To fail is sorrow, yet confess That love pays dearly for success! No blame to beauty! Let's complain Of the heart, which can so ill sustain Delight. Our griefs declare our fall, But how much more our joys! They pall With plucking, and celestial mirth Can find no footing on the earth, More than the bird of paradise, Which only lives the while it flies. Think, also, how 'twould suit your pride To have this woman for a bride. Whate'er her faults, she's one of those To whom the world's last polish owes A novel grace, which all who aspire To courtliest custom must acquire. The world's the sphere she's made to charm, Which you have shunn'd as if 'twere harm. Oh, law perverse, that loneliness Breeds love, society success! Though young, 'twere now o'er late in life To train yourself for such a wife; So she would suit herself to you, As women, when they marry, do. For, since 'tis for our dignity Our lords should sit like lords on high, We willingly deteriorate To a step below our rulers' state; And 'tis the commonest of things To see an angel, gay with wings, Lean weakly on a mortal's arm! Honoria would put off the charm Of lofty grace that caught your love, For fear you should not seem above Herself in fashion and degree, As in true merit. Thus, you see, 'Twere little kindness, wisdom none, To light your cot with such a sun. VII FROM FREDERICK Write not, my Mother, her dear name With the least word or hint of blame. Who else shall discommend her choice, I giving it my hearty voice? Wed me? Ah, never near her come The knowledge of the narrow home! Far fly from her dear face, that shows The sunshine lovelier than the rose, The sordid gravity they wear Who poverty's base burthen bear! (And all are poor who come to miss Their custom, though a crown be this.) My hope was, that the wheels of fate, For my exceeding need, might wait, And she, unseen amidst all eyes, Move sightless, till I sought the prize, With honour, in an equal field. But then came Vaughan, to whom I yield With grace as much as any man, In such cause, to another can. Had she been mine, it seems to me That I had that integrity And only joy in her delight— But each is his own favourite In love! The thought to bring me rest Is that of us she takes the best. 'Twas but to see him to be sure That choice for her remain'd no more! His brow, so gaily clear of craft; His wit, the timely truth that laugh'd To find itself so well express'd; His words, abundant yet the best; His spirit, of such handsome show You mark'd not that his looks were so; His bearing, prospects, birth, all these Might well, with small suit, greatly please; How greatly, when she saw arise The reflex sweetness of her eyes In his, and every breath defer Humbly its bated life to her; Whilst power and kindness of command, Which women can no more withstand Than we their grace, were still unquell'd, And force and flattery both compell'd Her softness! Say I'm worthy. I Grew, in her presence, cold and shy. It awed me, as an angel's might In raiment of reproachful light. Her gay looks told my sombre mood That what's not happy is not good; And, just because 'twas life to please, Death to repel her, truth and ease Deserted me; I strove to talk, And stammer'd foolishness; my walk Was like a drunkard's; if she took My arm, it stiffen'd, ached, and shook: A likely wooer! Blame her not; Nor ever say, dear Mother, aught Against that perfectness which is My strength, as once it was my bliss. And do not chafe at social rules. Leave that to charlatans and fools. Clay graffs and clods conceive the rose, So base still fathers best. Life owes Itself to bread; enough thereof And easy days condition love; And, kindly train'd, love's roses thrive, No more pale, scentless petals five, Which moisten the considerate eye To see what haste they make to die, But heavens of colour and perfume, Which, month by month, renew the bloom Of art-born graces, when the year In all the natural grove is sere. Blame nought then! Bright let be the air About my lonely cloud of care. VIII FROM FREDERICK Religion, duty, books, work, friends,— 'Tis good advice, but there it ends. I'm sick for what these have not got. Send no more books: they help me not; I do my work: the void's there still Which carefullest duty cannot fill. What though the inaugural hour of right Comes ever with a keen delight? Little relieves the labour's heat; Disgust oft crowns it when complete; And life, in fact, is not less dull For being very dutiful. ‘The stately homes of England,’ lo, ‘How beautiful they stand!’ They owe How much to nameless things like me Their beauty of security! But who can long a low toil mend By looking to a lofty end? And let me, since 'tis truth, confess The void's not fill'd by godliness. God is a tower without a stair, And His perfection, love's despair. 'Tis He shall judge me when I die; He suckles with the hissing fly The spider; gazes calmly down, Whilst rapine grips the helpless town. His vast love holds all this and more. In consternation I adore. Nor can I ease this aching gulf With friends, the pictures of myself. Then marvel not that I recur From each and all of these to her. For more of heaven than her have I No sensitive capacity. Had I but her, ah, what the gain Of owning aught but that domain! Nay, heaven's extent, however much, Cannot be more than many such; And, she being mine, should God to me Say ‘Lo! my Child, I give to thee All heaven besides,’ what could I then, But, as a child, to Him complain That whereas my dear Father gave A little space for me to have In His great garden, now, o'erblest, I've that, indeed, but all the rest, Which, somehow, makes it seem I've got All but my only cared-for plot. Enough was that for my weak hand To tend, my heart to understand. Oh, the sick fact, 'twixt her and me There's naught, and half a world of sea. IX FROM FREDERICK In two, in less than two hours more I set my foot on English shore, Two years untrod, and, strange to tell, Nigh miss'd through last night's storm! There fell A man from the shrouds, that roar'd to quench Even the billows' blast and drench. Besides me none was near to mark His loud cry in the louder dark, Dark, save when lightning show'd the deeps Standing about in stony heaps. No time for choice! A rope; a flash That flamed as he rose; a dizzy splash; A strange, inopportune delight Of mounting with the billowy might, And falling, with a thrill again Of pleasure shot from feet to brain; And both paced deck, ere any knew Our peril. Round us press'd the crew, With wonder in the eyes of most. As if the man who had loved and lost Honoria dared no more than that! My days have else been stale and flat. This life's at best, if justly scann'd, A tedious walk by the other's strand, With, here and there cast up, a piece Of coral or of ambergris, Which, boasted of abroad, we ignore The burden of the barren shore. I seldom write, for 'twould be still Of how the nerves refuse to thrill; How, throughout doubly-darken'd days, I cannot recollect her face; How to my heart her name to tell Is beating on a broken bell; And, to fill up the abhorrent gulf, Scarce loving her, I hate myself. Yet, latterly, with strange delight, Rich tides have risen in the night, And sweet dreams chased the fancies dense Of waking life's dull somnolence. I see her as I knew her, grace Already glory in her face; I move about, I cannot rest, For the proud brain and joyful breast I have of her. Or else I float, The pilot of an idle boat, Alone, alone with sky and sea, And her, the third simplicity. Or Mildred, to some question, cries, (Her merry meaning in her eyes,) ‘The Ball, oh, Frederick will go; ‘Honoria will be there!’ and, lo, As moisture sweet my seeing blurs To hear my name so link'd with hers, A mirror joins, by guilty chance, Either's averted, watchful glance! Or with me, in the Ball-Room's blaze, Her brilliant mildness thrids the maze; Our thoughts are lovely, and each word Is music in the music heard, And all things seem but parts to be Of one persistent harmony. By which I'm made divinely bold; The secret, which she knows, is told; And, laughing with a lofty bliss Of innocent accord, we kiss; About her neck my pleasure weeps; Against my lip the silk vein leaps; Then says an Angel, ‘Day or night, ‘If yours you seek, not her delight, ‘Although by some strange witchery ‘It seems you kiss her, 'tis not she; ‘But, whilst you languish at the side ‘Of a fair-foul phantasmal bride, ‘Surely a dragon and strong tower ‘Guard the true lady in her bower.’ And I say, ‘Dear my Lord, Amen!’ And the true lady kiss again. Or else some wasteful malady Devours her shape and dims her eye; No charms are left, where all were rife, Except her voice, which is her life, Wherewith she, for her foolish fear, Says trembling, ‘Do you love me, Dear?’ And I reply, ‘Sweetest, I vow ‘I never loved but half till now.’ She turns her face to the wall at this, And says, ‘Go, Love, 'tis too much bliss.’ And then a sudden pulse is sent About the sounding firmament In smitings as of silver bars; The bright disorder of the stars Is solved by music; far and near, Through infinite distinctions clear, Their twofold voices' deeper tone Utters the Name which all things own, And each ecstatic treble dwells On one whereof none other tells; And we, sublimed to song and fire, Take order in the wheeling quire, Till from the throbbing sphere I start, Waked by the heaving of my heart. Such dreams as these come night by night, Disturbing day with their delight. Portend they nothing? Who can tell! God yet may do some miracle. 'Tis nigh two years, and she's not wed, Or you would know! He may be dead, Or mad, and loving some one else, And she, much moved that nothing quells My constancy, or, simply wroth With such a wretch, accept my troth To spite him; or her beauty's gone, (And that's my dream!) and this man Vaughan Takes her release: or tongues malign, Confusing every ear but mine, Have smirch'd her: ah, 'twould move her, sure, To find I loved her all the more! Nay, now I think, haply amiss I read her words and looks, and his, That night! Did not his jealousy Show—Good my God, and can it be That I, a modest fool, all blest, Nothing of such a heaven guess'd? Oh, chance too frail, yet frantic sweet, To-morrow sees me at her feet! Yonder, at last, the glad sea roars Along the sacred English shores! There lies the lovely land I know, Where men and women lordliest grow; There peep the roofs where more than kings Postpone state cares to country things, And many a gay queen simply tends The babes on whom the world depends; There curls the wanton cottage smoke Of him that drives but bears no yoke; There laughs the realm where low and high Are lieges to society. And life has all too wide a scope, Too free a prospect for its hope, For any private good or ill, Except dishonour, quite to fill! Written in 1856. —Mother, since this was penn'd, I've read That ‘Mr. Vaughan, on Tuesday, wed ‘The beautiful Miss Churchill.’ So That's over; and to-morrow I go To take up my new post on board The ‘Wolf,’ my peace at last restored; My lonely faith, like heart-of-oak, Shock-season'd. Grief is now the cloak I clasp about me to prevent The deadly chill of a content With any near or distant good, Except the exact beatitude Which love has shown to my desire. Talk not of ‘other joys and higher,’ I hate and disavow all bliss As none for me which is not this. Think not I blasphemously cope With God's decrees, and cast off hope. How, when, and where can mine succeed? I'll trust He knows who made my need. Baseness of men! Pursuit being o'er, Doubtless her Husband feels no more The heaven of heavens of such a Bride, But, lounging, lets her please his pride With fondness, guerdons her caress With little names, and turns a tress Round idle fingers. If 'tis so, Why then I'm happier of the two! Better, for lofty loss, high pain, Than low content with lofty gain. Poor, foolish Dove, to trust from me Her happiness and dignity! X FROM FREDERICK I thought the worst had brought me balm: 'Twas but the tempest's central calm. Vague sinkings of the heart aver That dreadful wrong is come to her, And o'er this dream I brood and dote, And learn its agonies by rote. As if I loved it, early and late I make familiar with my fate, And feed, with fascinated will, On very dregs of finish'd ill. I think, she's near him now, alone, With wardship and protection none; Alone, perhaps, in the hindering stress Of airs that clasp him with her dress, They wander whispering by the wave; And haply now, in some sea-cave, Where the ribb'd sand is rarely trod, They laugh, they kiss. Oh, God! oh, God! There comes a smile acutely sweet Out of the picturing dark; I meet The ancient frankness of her gaze, That soft and heart-surprising blaze Of great goodwill and innocence, And perfect joy proceeding thence! Ah! made for earth's delight, yet such The mid-sea air's too gross to touch. At thought of which, the soul in me Is as the bird that bites a bee, And darts abroad on frantic wing, Tasting the honey and the sting; And, moaning where all round me sleep Amidst the moaning of the deep, I start at midnight from my bed— And have no right to strike him dead. What world is this that I am in, Where chance turns sanctity to sin! 'Tis crime henceforward to desire The only good; the sacred fire That sunn'd the universe is hell! I hear a Voice which argues well: ‘The Heaven hard has scorn'd your cry; ‘Fall down and worship me, and I ‘Will give you peace; go and profane ‘This pangful love, so pure, so vain, ‘And thereby win forgetfulness ‘And pardon of the spirit's excess, ‘Which soar'd too nigh that jealous Heaven ‘Ever, save thus, to be forgiven. ‘No Gospel has come down that cures ‘With better gain a loss like yours. ‘Be pious! Give the beggar pelf, ‘And love your neighbour as yourself! ‘You, who yet love, though all is o'er, ‘And she'll ne'er be your neighbour more, ‘With soul which can in pity smile ‘That aught with such a measure vile ‘As self should be at all named “love!” ‘Your sanctity the priests reprove; ‘Your case of grief they wholly miss; ‘The Man of Sorrows names not this. ‘The years, they say, graff love divine ‘On the lopp'd stock of love like thine; ‘The wild tree dies not, but converts. ‘So be it; but the lopping hurts, ‘The graff takes tardily! Men stanch ‘Meantime with earth the bleeding branch, ‘There's nothing heals one woman's loss, ‘And lighten's life's eternal cross ‘With intermission of sound rest, ‘Like lying in another's breast. ‘The cure is, to your thinking, low! ‘Is not life all, henceforward, so?’ Ill Voice, at least thou calm'st my mood. I'll sleep! But, as I thus conclude, The intrusions of her grace dispel The comfortable glooms of hell. A wonder! Ere these lines were dried, Vaughan and my Love, his three-days' Bride, Became my guests. I look'd, and, lo, In beauty soft as is the snow And powerful as the avalanche, She lit the deck. The Heav'n-sent chance! She smiled, surprised. They came to see The ship, not thinking to meet me. At infinite distance she's my day: What then to him? Howbeit they say 'Tis not so sunny in the sun But men might live cool lives thereon! All's well; for I have seen arise That reflex sweetness of her eyes In his, and watch'd his breath defer Humbly its bated life to her, His wife. My Love, she's safe in his Devotion! What ask'd I but this? They bade adieu; I saw them go Across the sea; and now I know The ultimate hope I rested on, The hope beyond the grave, is gone, The hope that, in the heavens high, At last it should appear that I Loved most, and so, by claim divine, Should have her, in the heavens, for mine, According to such nuptial sort As may subsist in the holy court, Where, if there are all kinds of joys To exhaust the multitude of choice In many mansions, then there are Loves personal and particular, Conspicuous in the glorious sky Of universal charity, As Phosphor in the sunrise. Now I've seen them, I believe their vow Immortal; and the dreadful thought, That he less honour'd than he ought Her sanctity, is laid to rest, And, blessing them, I too am blest. My goodwill, as a springing air, Unclouds a beauty in despair; I stand beneath the sky's pure cope Unburthen'd even by a hope; And peace unspeakable, a joy Which hope would deaden and destroy, Like sunshine fills the airy gulf Left by the vanishing of self. That I have known her; that she moves Somewhere all-graceful; that she loves, And is belov'd, and that she's so Most happy, and to heaven will go, Where I may meet with her, (yet this I count but accidental bliss,) And that the full, celestial weal Of all shall sensitively feel The partnership and work of each, And thus my love and labour reach Her region, there the more to bless Her last, consummate happiness, Is guerdon up to the degree Of that alone true loyalty Which, sacrificing, is not nice About the terms of sacrifice, But offers all, with smiles that say, 'Tis little, but it is for aye! XI FROM MRS. GRAHAM You wanted her, my Son, for wife, With the fierce need of life in life. That nobler passion of an hour Was rather prophecy than power; And nature, from such stress unbent, Recurs to deep discouragement. Trust not such peace yet; easy breath, In hot diseases, argues death; And tastelessness within the mouth Worse fever shows than heat or drouth. Wherefore take, Frederick, timely fear Against a different danger near: Wed not one woman, oh, my Child, Because another has not smiled! Oft, with a disappointed man, The first who cares to win him can; For, after love's heroic strain, Which tired the heart and brought no gain, He feels consoled, relieved, and eased To meet with her who can be pleased To proffer kindness, and compute His acquiescence for pursuit; Who troubles not his lonely mood; And asks for love mere gratitude. Ah, desperate folly! Yet, we know, Who wed through love wed mostly so. At least, my Son, when wed you do, See that the woman equals you, Nor rush, from having loved too high, Into a worse humility. A poor estate's a foolish plea For marrying to a base degree. A woman grown cannot be train'd, Or, if she could, no love were gain'd; For, never was a man's heart caught By graces he himself had taught. And fancy not 'tis in the might Of man to do without delight; For, should you in her nothing find To exhilarate the higher mind, Your soul would deaden useless wings With wickedness of lawful things, And vampire pleasure swift destroy Even the memory of joy. So let no man, in desperate mood, Wed a dull girl because she's good. All virtues in his wife soon dim, Except the power of pleasing him, Which may small virtue be, or none! I know my just and tender Son, To whom the dangerous grace is given That scorns a good which is not heaven; My Child, who used to sit and sigh Under the bright, ideal sky, And pass, to spare the farmer's wheat, The poppy and the meadow-sweet! He would not let his wife's heart ache For what was mainly his mistake; But, having err'd so, all his force Would fix upon the hard, right course. She's graceless, say, yet good and true, And therefore inly fair, and, through The veils which inward beauty fold, Faith can her loveliness behold. Ah, that's soon tired; faith falls away Without the ceremonial stay Of outward loveliness and awe. The weightier matters of the law She pays: mere mint and cumin not; And, in the road that she was taught, She treads, and takes for granted still Nature's immedicable ill; So never wears within her eyes A false report of paradise, Nor ever modulates her mirth With vain compassion of the earth, Which made a certain happier face Affecting, and a gayer grace With pathos delicately edged! Yet, though she be not privileged To unlock for you your heart's delight, (Her keys being gold, but not the right,) On lower levels she may do! Her joy is more in loving you Than being loved, and she commands All tenderness she understands. It is but when you proffer more The yoke weighs heavy and chafes sore. It's weary work enforcing love On one who has enough thereof, And honour on the lowlihead Of ignorance! Besides, you dread, In Leah's arms, to meet the eyes Of Rachel, somewhere in the skies, And both return, alike relieved, To life less loftily conceived. Alas, alas! Then wait the mood In which a woman may be woo'd Whose thoughts and habits are too high For honour to be flattery, And who would surely not allow The suit that you could proffer now. Her equal yoke would sit with ease; It might, with wearing, even please, (Not with a better word to move The loyal wrath of present love); She would not mope when you were gay, For want of knowing aught to say; Nor vex you with unhandsome waste Of thoughts ill-timed and words ill-placed; Nor reckon small things duties small, And your fine sense fantastical; Nor would she bring you up a brood Of strangers bound to you by blood, Boys of a meaner moral race, Girls with their mother's evil grace, But not her chance to sometimes find Her critic past his judgment kind; Nor, unaccustom'd to respect, Which men, where 'tis not claim'd, neglect, Confirm you selfish and morose, And slowly, by contagion, gross; But, glad and able to receive The honour you would long to give, Would hasten on to justify Expectancy, however high, Whilst you would happily incur Compulsion to keep up with her. XII FROM FREDERICK Your letter, Mother, bears the date Of six months back, and comes too late. My Love, past all conceiving lost, A change seem'd good, at any cost, From lonely, stupid, silent grief, Vain, objectless, beyond relief, And, like a sea-fog, settled dense On fancy, feeling, thought, and sense. I grew so idle, so despised Myself, my powers, by Her unprized, Honouring my post, but nothing more, And lying, when I lived on shore, So late of mornings: weak tears stream'd For such slight cause,—if only gleam'd, Remotely, beautifully bright, On clouded eves at sea, the light Of English headlands in the sun,— That soon I deem'd 'twere better done To lay this poor, complaining wraith Of unreciprocated faith: And so, with heart still bleeding quick, But strengthen'd by the comfort sick Of knowing that She could not care, I turn'd away from my despair, And told our chaplain's daughter, Jane,— A dear, good girl, who saw my pain, And look'd as if she pitied me,— How glad and thankful I should be If some kind woman, not above Myself in rank, would give her love To one that knew not how to woo. Whereat she, without more ado, Blush'd, spoke of love return'd, and closed With what she thought I had proposed. And, trust me, Mother, I and Jane, We suit each other well. My gain Is very great in this good Wife, To whom I'm bound, for natural life, By hearty faith, yet crossing not My faith towards—I know not what! As to the ether is the air, Is her good to Honoria's fair; One place is full of both, yet each Lies quite beyond the other's reach And recognition. If you say, Am I contented? Yea and nay! For what's base but content to grow With less good than the best we know? But think me not from life withdrawn, By passion for a hope that's gone, So far as to forget how much A woman is, as merely such, To man's affection. What is best, In each, belongs to all the rest; And though, in marriage, quite to kiss And half to love the custom is, 'Tis such dishonour, ruin bare, The soul's interior despair, And life between two troubles toss'd, To me, who think not with the most; Whatever 'twould have been, before My Cousin's time, 'tis now so sore A treason to the abiding throne Of that sweet love which I have known, I cannot live so, and I bend My mind perforce to comprehend That He who gives command to love Does not require a thing above The strength He gives. The highest degree Of the hardest grace, humility; The step t'ward heaven the latest trod, And that which makes us most like God, And us much more than God behoves, Is, to be humble in our loves. Henceforth for ever therefore I Renounce all partiality Of passion. Subject to control Of that perspective of the soul Which God Himself pronounces good, Confirming claims of neighbourhood, And giving man, for earthly life, The closest neighbour in a wife, I'll serve all. Jane be much more dear Than all as she is much more near! I'll love her! Yea, and love's joy comes Ever from self-love's martyrdoms! Yet, not to lie for God, 'tis true That 'twas another joy I knew When freighted was my heart with fire Of fond, irrational desire For fascinating, female charms, And hopeless heaven in Her mild arms. Nor wrong I any, if I profess That care for heaven with me were less But that I'm utterly imbued With faith of all Earth's hope renew'd In realms where no short-coming pains Expectance, and dear love disdains Time's treason, and the gathering dross, And lasts for ever in the gloss Of newness. All the bright past seems, Now, but a splendour in my dreams, Which shows, albeit the dreamer wakes, The standard of right life. Life aches To be therewith conform'd; but, oh, The world's so stolid, dark, and low! That and the mortal element Forbid the beautiful intent, And, like the unborn butterfly, It feels the wings, and wants the sky. But perilous is the lofty mood Which cannot yoke with lowly good. Right life, for me, is life that wends By lowly ways to lofty ends. I well perceive, at length, that haste T'ward heaven itself is only waste; And thus I dread the impatient spur Of aught that speaks too plain of Her. There's little here that story tells; But music talks of nothing else. Therefore, when music breathes, I say, (And urge my task,) Away, away! Thou art the voice of one I knew, But what thou say'st is not yet true; Thou art the voice of her I loved, And I would not be vainly moved. So that which did from death set free All things, now dons death's mockery, And takes its place with things that are But little noted. Do not mar For me your peace! My health is high. The proud possession of mine eye Departed, I am much like one Who had by haughty custom grown To think gilt rooms, and spacious grounds, Horses, and carriages, and hounds, Fine linen, and an eider bed As much his need as daily bread, And honour of men as much or more. Till, strange misfortune smiting sore, His pride all goes to pay his debts, A lodging anywhere he gets, And takes his family thereto Weeping, and other relics few, Allow'd, by them that seize his pelf, As precious only to himself. Yet the sun shines; the country green Has many riches, poorly seen From blazon'd coaches; grace at meat Goes well with thrift in what they eat; And there's amends for much bereft In better thanks for much that's left! Jane is not fair, yet pleases well The eye in which no others dwell; And features somewhat plainly set, And homely manners leave her yet The crowning boon and most express Of Heaven's inventive tenderness, A woman. But I do her wrong, Letting the world's eyes guide my tongue! She has a handsomeness that pays No homage to the hourly gaze, And dwells not on the arch'd brow's height And lids which softly lodge the light, Nor in the pure field of the cheek Flow'rs, though the soul be still to seek; But shows as fits that solemn place Whereof the window is the face: Blankness and leaden outlines mark What time the Church within is dark; Yet view it on a Festal night, Or some occasion else for light, And each ungainly line is seen A special character to mean Of Saint or Prophet, and the whole Blank window is a living scroll. For hours, the clock upon the shelf, Has all the talking to itself; But to and fro her needle runs Twice, while the clock is ticking once; And, when a wife is well in reach, Not silence separates, but speech; And I, contented, read, or smoke, And idly think, or idly stroke The winking cat, or watch the fire, In social peace that does not tire; Until, at easeful end of day, She moves, and puts her work away, And, saying ‘How cold 'tis,’ or ‘How warm,’ Or something else as little harm, Comes, used to finding, kindly press'd, A woman's welcome to my breast, With all the great advantage clear Of none else having been so near. But sometimes, (how shall I deny!) There falls, with her thus fondly by, Dejection, and a chilling shade. Remember'd pleasures, as they fade, Salute me, and colossal grow, Like foot-prints in the thawing snow. I feel oppress'd beyond my force With foolish envy and remorse. I love this woman, but I might Have loved some else with more delight; And strange it seems of God that He Should make a vain capacity. Such times of ignorant relapse, 'Tis well she does not talk, perhaps. The dream, the discontent, the doubt, To some injustice flaming out, Were't else, might leave us both to moan A kind tradition overthrown, And dawning promise once more dead In the pernicious lowlihead Of not aspiring to be fair. And what am I, that I should dare Dispute with God, who moulds one clay To honour and shame, and wills to pay With equal wages them that delve About His vines one hour or twelve! XIII FROM LADY CLITHEROE TO MARY CHURCHILL I've dreadful news, my Sister dear! Frederick has married, as we hear, Oh, such a girl! This fact we get From Mr. Barton, whom we met At Abury once. He used to know, At Race and Hunt, Lord Clitheroe, And writes that he ‘has seen Fred Graham, ‘Commander of the “Wolf,”—the same ‘The Mess call'd Joseph,—with his Wife ‘Under his arm.’ He ‘lays his life, ‘The fellow married her for love, ‘For there was nothing else to move. ‘H. is her Shibboleth. 'Tis said ‘Her Mother was a Kitchen-Maid.’ Poor Fred! What will Honoria say? She thought so highly of him. Pray Tell it her gently. I've no right, I know you hold, to trust my sight; But Frederick's state could not be hid! And Felix, coming when he did, Was lucky; for Honoria, too, Was half in love. How warm she grew On ‘worldliness,’ when once I said I fancied that, in ladies, Fred Had tastes much better than his means! His hand was worthy of a Queen's, Said she, and actually shed tears The night he left us for two years, And sobb'd, when ask'd the cause to tell, That ‘Frederick look'd so miserable.’ He did look very dull, no doubt, But such things girls don't cry about. What weathercocks men always prove! You're quite right not to fall in love. I never did, and, truth to tell, I don't think it respectable. The man can't understand it, too. He likes to be in love with you, But scarce knows how, if you love him, Poor fellow. When 'tis woman's whim To serve her husband night and day, The kind soul lets her have her way! So, if you wed, as soon you should, Be selfish for your husband's good. Happy the men who relegate Their pleasures, vanities, and state To us. Their nature seems to be To enjoy themselves by deputy, For, seeking their own benefit, Dear, what a mess they make of it! A man will work his bones away, If but his wife will only play; He does not mind how much he's teased, So that his plague looks always pleased; And never thanks her, while he lives, For anything, but what he gives! 'Tis hard to manage men, we hear! Believe me, nothing's easier, Dear. The most important step by far Is finding what their colours are. The next is, not to let them know The reason why they love us so. The indolent droop of a blue shawl, Or gray silk's fluctuating fall, Covers the multitude of sins In me. Your husband, Love, might wince At azure, and be wild at slate, And yet do well with chocolate. Of course you'd let him fancy he Adored you for your piety. XIV FROM JANE TO HER MOTHER Dear Mother, as you write, I see How glad and thankful I should be For such a husband. Yet to tell The truth, I am so miserable! How could he—I remember, though, He never said he loved me! No, He is so right that all seems wrong I've done and thought my whole life long! I'm grown so dull and dead with fear That Yes and No, when he is near, Is all I have to say. He's quite Unlike what most would call polite, And yet, when first I saw him come To tea in Aunt's fine drawing-room, He made me feel so common! Oh, How dreadful if he thinks me so! It's no use trying to behave To him. His eye, so kind and grave, Sees through and through me! Could not you, Without his knowing that I knew, Ask him to scold me now and then? Mother, it's such a weary strain The way he has of treating me As if 'twas something fine to be A woman; and appearing not To notice any faults I've got! I know he knows I'm plain, and small, Stupid, and ignorant, and all Awkward and mean; and, by degrees, I see a beauty which he sees, When often he looks strange awhile, Then recollects me with a smile. I wish he had that fancied Wife, With me for Maid, now! all my life To dress her out for him, and make Her looks the lovelier for his sake; To have her rate me till I cried; Then see her seated by his side, And driven off proudly to the Ball; Then to stay up for her, whilst all The servants were asleep; and hear At dawn the carriage rolling near, And let them in; and hear her laugh, And boast, he said that none was half So beautiful, and that the Queen, Who danced with him the first, had seen And noticed her, and ask'd who was That lady in the golden gauze? And then to go to bed, and lie In a sort of heavenly jealousy, Until 'twas broad day, and I guess'd She slept, nor knew how she was bless'd. Pray burn this letter. I would not Complain, but for the fear I've got Of going wild, as we hear tell Of people shut up in a cell, With no one there to talk to. He Must never know he is loved by me The most; he'd think himself to blame; And I should almost die for shame. If being good would serve instead Of being graceful, ah, then, Fred— But I, myself, I never could See what's in women's being good; For all their goodness is to do Just what their nature tells them to. Now, when a man would do what's right, He has to try with all his might. Though true and kind in deed and word, Fred's not a vessel of the Lord. But I have hopes of him; for, oh, How can we ever surely know But that the very darkest place May be the scene of saving grace! XV FROM FREDERICK ‘How did I feel?’ The little wight Fill'd me, unfatherly, with fright! So grim it gazed, and, out of the sky, There came, minute, remote, the cry, Piercing, of original pain. I put the wonder back to Jane, And her delight seem'd dash'd, that I, Of strangers still by nature shy, Was not familiar quite so soon With her small friend of many a moon. But, when the new-made Mother smiled, She seem'd herself a little child, Dwelling at large beyond the law By which, till then, I judged and saw; And that fond glow which she felt stir For it, suffused my heart for her; To whom, from the weak babe, and thence To me, an influent innocence, Happy, reparative of life, Came, and she was indeed my wife, As there, lovely with love she lay, Brightly contented all the day To hug her sleepy little boy, In the reciprocated joy Of touch, the childish sense of love, Ever inquisitive to prove Its strange possession, and to know If the eye's report be really so. XVI FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM Dear Mother,—such if you'll allow, In love, not law, I'll call you now,— I hope you're well. I write to say Frederick has got, besides his pay, A good appointment in the Docks; Also to thank you for the frocks And shoes for Baby. I, (D.V.,) Shall soon be strong. Fred goes to sea No more. I am so glad; because, Though kinder husband never was, He seems still kinder to become The more he stays with me at home. When we are parted, I see plain He's dull till he gets used again To marriage. Do not tell him, though; I would not have him know I know, For all the world. I try to mind All your advice; but sometimes find I do not well see how. I thought To take it about dress; so bought A gay new bonnet, gown, and shawl; But Frederick was not pleased at all; For, though he smiled, and said, ‘How smart!’ I feel, you know, what's in his heart. But I shall learn! I fancied long That care in dress was very wrong, Till Frederick, in his startling way, When I began to blame, one day, The Admiral's Wife, because we hear She spends two hours, or something near, In dressing, took her part, and said How all things deck themselves that wed; How birds and plants grow fine to please Each other in their marriages; And how (which certainly is true— It never struck me—did it you?) Dress was, at first, Heaven's ordinance, And has much Scripture countenance. For Eliezer, we are told, Adorn'd with jewels and with gold Rebecca. In the Psalms, again, How the King's Daughter dress'd! And, then, The Good Wife in the Proverbs, she Made herself clothes of tapestry, Purple and silk: and there's much more I had not thought about before! But Fred's so clever! Do you know, Since Baby came, he loves me so! I'm really useful, now, to Fred; And none could do so well instead. It's nice to fancy, if I died, He'd miss me from the Darling's side! Also, there's something now, you see, On which we talk, and quite agree; On which, without pride too, I can Hope I'm as wise as any man. I should be happy now, if quite Sure that in one thing Fred was right. But, though I trust his prayers are said, Because he goes so late to bed, I doubt his Calling. Glad to find A text adapted to his mind,— That where St. Paul, in Man and Wife, Allows a little worldly life,— He smiled, and said that he knew all Such things as that without St. Paul! And once he said, when I with pain Had got him just to read Romaine, ‘Men's creeds should not their hopes condemn. ‘Who wait for heaven to come to them ‘Are little like to go to heaven, ‘If logic's not the devil's leaven!’ I cried at such a wicked joke, And he, surprised, went out to smoke. But to judge him is not for me, Who myself sin so dreadfully As half to doubt if I should care To go to heaven, and he not there. He must be right; and I dare say I shall soon understand his way. To other things, once strange, I've grown Accustom'd, nay, to like. I own 'Twas long before I got well used To sit, while Frederick read or mused For hours, and scarcely spoke. When he For all that, held the door to me, Pick'd up my handkerchief, and rose To set my chair, with other shows Of honour, such as men, 'tis true, To sweethearts and fine ladies do, It almost seem'd an unkind jest; But now I like these ways the best. They somehow make me gentle and good; And I don't mind his quiet mood. If Frederick does seem dull awhile, There's Baby. You should see him smile! I'm pretty and nice to him, sweet Pet, And he will learn no better yet: Indeed, now little Johnny makes A busier time of it, and takes Our thoughts off one another more, I'm happy as need be, I'm sure! XVII FROM FELIX TO HONORIA Let me, Beloved, while gratitude Is garrulous with coming good, Or ere the tongue of happiness Be silenced by your soft caress, Relate how, musing here of you, The clouds, the intermediate blue, The air that rings with larks, the grave And distant rumour of the wave, The solitary sailing skiff, The gusty corn-field on the cliff, The corn-flower by the crumbling ledge, Or, far-down at the shingle's edge, The sighing sea's recurrent crest Breaking, resign'd to its unrest, All whisper, to my home-sick thought, Of charms in you till now uncaught, Or only caught as dreams, to die Ere they were own'd by memory. High and ingenious Decree Of joy-devising Deity! You whose ambition only is The assurance that you make my bliss, (Hence my first debt of love to show, That you, past showing, indeed do so!) Trust me, the world, the firmament, With diverse-natured worlds besprent, Were rear'd in no mere undivine Boast of omnipotent design, The lion differing from the snake But for the trick of difference sake, And comets darting to and fro Because in circles planets go; But rather that sole love might be Refresh'd throughout eternity In one sweet faith, for ever strange, Mirror'd by circumstantial change. For, more and more, do I perceive That everything is relative To you, and that there's not a star, Nor nothing in't, so strange or far, But, if 'twere scanned, 'twould chiefly mean Somewhat, till then, in you unseen, Something to make the bondage strait Of you and me more intimate, Some unguess'd opportunity Of nuptials in a new degree. But, oh, with what a novel force Your best-conn'd beauties, by remorse Of absence, touch; and, in my heart, How bleeds afresh the youthful smart Of passion fond, despairing still To utter infinite good-will By worthy service! Yet I know That love is all that love can owe, And this to offer is no less Of worth, in kind speech or caress, Than if my life-blood I should give. For good is God's prerogative, And Love's deed is but to prepare The flatter'd, dear Belov'd to dare Acceptance of His gifts. When first On me your happy beauty burst, Honoria, verily it seem'd That naught beyond you could be dream'd Of beauty and of heaven's delight. Zeal of an unknown infinite Yet bade me ever wish you more Beatified than e'er before. Angelical were your replies To my prophetic flatteries; And sweet was the compulsion strong That drew me in the course along Of heaven's increasing bright allure, With provocations fresh of your Victorious capacity. Whither may love, so fledged, not fly? Did not mere Earth hold fast the string Of this celestial soaring thing, So measure and make sensitive, And still, to the nerves, nice notice give Of each minutest increment Of such interminable ascent, The heart would lose all count, and beat Unconscious of a height so sweet, And the spirit-pursuing senses strain Their steps on the starry track in vain! But, reading now the note just come, With news of you, the babes, and home, I think, and say, ‘To-morrow eve ‘With kisses me will she receive;’ And, thinking, for extreme delight Of love's extremes, I laugh outright. XVIII FROM FREDERICK Eight wedding-days gone by, and none Yet kept, to keep them all in one, Jane and myself, with John and Grace On donkeys, visited the place I first drew breath in, Knatchley Wood. Bearing the basket, stuff'd with food, Milk, loaves, hard eggs, and marmalade, I halted where the wandering glade Divides the thicket. There I knew, It seem'd, the very drops of dew Below the unalter'd eglantine. Nothing had changed since I was nine! In the green desert, down to eat We sat, our rustic grace at meat Good appetite, through that long climb Hungry two hours before the time. And there Jane took her stitching out, And John for birds'-nests pry'd about, And Grace and Baby, in between The warm blades of the breathing green, Dodged grasshoppers; and I no less, In conscientious idleness, Enjoy'd myself, under the noon Stretch'd, and the sounds and sights of June Receiving, with a drowsy charm, Through muffled ear and folded arm. And then, as if I sweetly dream'd, I half-remember'd how it seem'd When I, too, was a little child About the wild wood roving wild. Pure breezes from the far-off height Melted the blindness from my sight, Until, with rapture, grief, and awe, I saw again as then I saw. As then I saw, I saw again The harvest-waggon in the lane, With high-hung tokens of its pride Left in the elms on either side; The daisies coming out at dawn In constellations on the lawn; The glory of the daffodil; The three black windmills on the hill, Whose magic arms, flung wildly by, Sent magic shadows o'er the rye. Within the leafy coppice, lo, More wealth than miser's dreams could show, The blackbird's warm and woolly brood, Five golden beaks agape for food; The Gipsies, all the summer seen Native as poppies to the Green; The winter, with its frosts and thaws And opulence of hips and haws; The lovely marvel of the snow; The Tamar, with its altering show Of gay ships sailing up and down, Among the fields and by the Town; And, dearer far than anything, Came back the songs you used to sing. (Ah, might you sing such songs again, And I, your Child, but hear as then, With conscious profit of the gulf Flown over from my present self!) And, as to men's retreating eyes, Beyond high mountains higher rise, Still farther back there shone to me The dazzling dusk of infancy. Thither I look'd, as, sick of night, The Alpine shepherd looks to the height, And does not see the day, 'tis true, But sees the rosy tops that do. Meantime Jane stitch'd, and fann'd the flies From my repose, with hush'd replies To Grace, and smiles when Baby fell. Her countenance love visible Appear'd, love audible her voice. Why in the past alone rejoice, Whilst here was wealth before me cast Which, I could feel, if 'twere but past Were then most precious? Question vain, When ask'd again and yet again, Year after year; yet now, for no Cause, but that heaven's bright winds will blow Not at our pray'r but as they list, It brought that distant, golden mist To grace the hour, firing the deep Of spirit and the drowsy keep Of joy, till, spreading uncontain'd, The holy power of seeing gain'd The outward eye, this owning even That where there's love and truth there's heaven. Debtor to few, forgotten hours Am I, that truths for me are powers. Ah, happy hours, 'tis something yet Not to forget that I forget! And now a cloud, bright, huge and calm, Rose, doubtful if for bale or balm; O'ertoppling towers and bulwarks bright Appear'd, at beck of viewless might, Along a rifted mountain range. Untraceable and swift in change, Those glittering peaks, disrupted, spread To solemn bulks, seen overhead; The sunshine quench'd, from one dark form Fumed the appalling light of storm. Straight to the zenith, black with bale, The Gipsies' smoke rose deadly pale; And one wide night of hopeless hue Hid from the heart the recent blue. And soon, with thunder crackling loud, A flash reveal'd the formless cloud: Lone sailing rack, far wavering rim, And billowy tracks of stormland dim. We stood, safe group'd beneath a shed. Grace hid behind Jane's gown for dread, Who told her, fondling with her hair, ‘The naughty noise! but God took care ‘Of all good girls.’ John seem'd to me Too much for Jane's theology, Who bade him watch the tempest. Now A blast made all the woodland bow; Against the whirl of leaves and dust Kine dropp'd their heads; the tortured gust Jagg'd and convuls'd the ascending smoke To mockery of the lightning's stroke. The blood prick'd, and a blinding flash And close coinstantaneous crash Humbled the soul, and the rain all round Resilient dimm'd the whistling ground, Nor flagg'd in force from first to last, Till, sudden as it came, 'twas past, Leaving a trouble in the copse Of brawling birds and tinkling drops. Change beyond hope! Far thunder faint Mutter'd its vast and vain complaint, And gaps and fractures, fringed with light, Show'd the sweet skies, with squadrons bright Of cloudlets, glittering calm and fair Through gulfs of calm and glittering air. With this adventure, we return'd. The roads the feet no longer burn'd. A wholesome smell of rainy earth Refresh'd our spirits, tired of mirth. The donkey-boy drew friendly near My Wife, and, touch'd by the kind cheer Her countenance show'd, or sooth'd perchance By the soft evening's sad advance, As we were, stroked the flanks and head Of the ass, and, somewhat thick-voiced, said, ‘To 'ave to wop the donkeys so ‘'Ardens the 'art, but they won't go ‘Without!’ My Wife, by this impress'd, As men judge poets by their best, When now we reach'd the welcome door, Gave him his hire, and sixpence more. XIX FROM JANE Dear Mrs. Graham, the fever's past, And Fred is well. I, in my last, Forgot to say that, while 'twas on, A lady, call'd Honoria Vaughan, One of his Salisbury Cousins, came. Had I, she ask'd me, heard her name? 'Twas that Honoria, no doubt, Whom he would sometimes talk about And speak to, when his nights were bad, And so I told her that I had. She look'd so beautiful and kind! And just the sort of wife my mind Pictured for Fred, with many tears, In those sad early married years. Visiting, yesterday, she said, The Admiral's Wife, she learn'd that Fred Was very ill; she begg'd to be, If possible, of use to me. What could she do? Last year, his Aunt Died, leaving her, who had no want, Her fortune. Half was his, she thought; But he, she knew, would not be brought To take his rights at second hand. Yet something might, she hoped, be plann'd. What did I think of putting John To school and college? Mr. Vaughan, When John was old enough, could give Preferment to her relative; And she should be so pleased.—I said I felt quite sure that dearest Fred Would be most thankful. Would we come, And make ourselves, she ask'd, at home, Next month, at High-Hurst? Change of air Both he and I should need, and there At leisure we could talk, and then Fix plans, as John was nearly ten. It seemed so rude to think and doubt, So I said, Yes. In going out, She said, ‘How strange of Frederick, Dear,’ (I wish he had been there to hear,) ‘To send no cards, or tell me what ‘A nice new Cousin I had got!’ Was not that kind? When Fred grew strong, I had, I found, done very wrong. Anger was in his voice and eye. With people born and bred so high As Fred and Mrs. Vaughan and you, It's hard to guess what's right to do; And he won't teach me! Dear Fred wrote, Directly, such a lovely note, Which, though it undid all I had done, Was, both to me and Mrs. Vaughan, So kind! His words, I can't say why, Like soldiers' music, made me cry. BOOK II I FROM JANE TO HER MOTHER Thank Heaven, the burthens on the heart Are not half known till they depart! Although I long'd, for many a year, To love with love that casts out fear, My Frederick's kindness frighten'd me, And heaven seem'd less far off than he; And in my fancy I would trace A lady with an angel's face, That made devotion simply debt, Till sick with envy and regret, And wicked grief that God should e'er Make women, and not make them fair. That he might love me more because Another in his memory was, And that my indigence might be To him what Baby's was to me, The chief of charms, who could have thought? But God's wise way is to give nought Till we with asking it are tired; And when, indeed, the change desired Comes, lest we give ourselves the praise, It comes by Providence, not Grace; And mostly our thanks for granted pray'rs Are groans at unexpected cares. First Baby went to heaven, you know, And, five weeks after, Grace went, too. Then he became more talkative, And, stooping to my heart, would give Signs of his love, which pleased me more Than all the proofs he gave before; And, in that time of our great grief, We talk'd religion for relief; For, though we very seldom name Religion, we now think the same! Oh, what a bar is thus removed To loving and to being loved! For no agreement really is In anything when none's in this. Why, Mother, once, if Frederick press'd His wife against his hearty breast, The interior difference seem'd to tear My own, until I could not bear The trouble. 'Twas a dreadful strife, And show'd, indeed, that faith is life. He never felt this. If he did, I'm sure it could not have been hid; For wives, I need not say to you, Can feel just what their husbands do, Without a word or look; but then It is not so, you know, with men. From that time many a Scripture text Help'd me, which had, before, perplex'd. Oh, what a wond'rous word seem'd this: He is my head, as Christ is his! None ever could have dared to see In marriage such a dignity For man, and for his wife, still less, Such happy, happy lowliness, Had God Himself not made it plain! This revelation lays the rein— If I may speak so—on the neck Of a wife's love, takes thence the check Of conscience, and forbids to doubt Its measure is to be without All measure, and a fond excess Is here her rule of godliness. I took him not for love but fright; He did but ask a dreadful right. In this was love, that he loved me The first, who was mere poverty. All that I know of love he taught; And love is all I know of aught. My merit is so small by his, That my demerit is my bliss. My life is hid with him in Christ, Never thencefrom to be enticed; And in his strength have I such rest As when the baby on my breast Finds what it knows not how to seek, And, very happy, very weak, Lies, only knowing all is well, Pillow'd on kindness palpable. II FROM LADY CLITHEROE TO MARY CHURCHILL Dear Saint, I'm still at High-Hurst Park. The house is fill'd with folks of mark. Honoria suits a good estate Much better than I hoped. How fate Loads her with happiness and pride! And such a loving lord, beside! But between us, Sweet, everything Has limits, and to build a wing To this old house, when Courtholm stands Empty upon his Berkshire lands, And all that Honor might be near Papa, was buying love too dear. With twenty others, there are two Guests here, whose names will startle you: Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Graham! I thought he stay'd away for shame. He and his wife were ask'd, you know, And would not come, four years ago. You recollect Miss Smythe found out Who she had been, and all about Her people at the Powder-mill; And how the fine Aunt tried to instil Haut ton, and how, at last poor Jane Had got so shy and gauche that, when The Dockyard gentry came to sup, She always had to be lock'd up; And some one wrote to us and said Her mother was a kitchen-maid. Dear Mary, you'll be charm'd to know It must be all a fib. But, oh, She is the oddest little Pet On which my eyes were ever set! She's so outrée and natural That, when she first arrived, we all Wonder'd, as when a robin comes In through the window to eat crumbs At breakfast with us. She has sense, Humility, and confidence; And, save in dressing just a thought Gayer in colours than she ought, (To-day she looks a cross between Gipsy and Fairy, red and green,) She always happens to do well. And yet one never quite can tell What she might do or utter next. Lord Clitheroe is much perplex'd. Her husband, every now and then, Looks nervous; all the other men Are charm'd. Yet she has neither grace, Nor one good feature in her face. Her eyes, indeed, flame in her head, Like very altar-fires to Fred, Whose steps she follows everywhere Like a tame duck, to the despair Of Colonel Holmes, who does his part To break her funny little heart. Honor's enchanted. 'Tis her view That people, if they're good and true, And treated well, and let alone, Will kindly take to what's their own, And always be original, Like children. Honor's just like all The rest of us! But, thinking so, 'Tis well she miss'd Lord Clitheroe, Who hates originality, Though he puts up with it in me. Poor Mrs. Graham has never been To the Opera! You should have seen The innocent way she told the Earl She thought Plays sinful when a girl, And now she never had a chance! Frederick's complacent smile and glance Towards her, show'd me, past a doubt, Honoria had been quite cut out. 'Tis very strange; for Mrs. Graham, Though Frederick's fancy none can blame, Seems the last woman you'd have thought Her lover would have ever sought. She never reads, I find, nor goes Anywhere; so that I suppose She got at all she ever knew By growing up, as kittens do. Talking of kittens, by-the-bye, You have more influence than I With dear Honoria. Get her, Dear, To be a little more severe With those sweet Children. They've the run Of all the place. When school was done, Maud burst in, while the Earl was there, With ‘Oh, Mama, do be a bear!’ Do you know, Dear, this odd wife of Fred Adores his old Love in his stead! She is so nice, yet, I should say, Not quite the thing for every day. Wonders are wearying! Felix goes Next Sunday with her to the Close, And you will judge. Honoria asks All Wiltshire Belles here; Felix basks Like Puss in fire-shine, when the room Is thus aflame with female bloom. But then she smiles when most would pout; And so his lawless loves go out With the last brocade. 'Tis not the same, I fear, with Mrs. Frederick Graham. Honoria should not have her here,— And this you might just hint, my Dear,— For Felix says he never saw Such proof of what he holds for law, That ‘beauty is love which can be seen.’ Whatever he by this may mean, Were it not dreadful if he fell In love with her on principle! III FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM Mother, I told you how, at first, I fear'd this visit to the Hurst. Fred must, I felt, be so distress'd By aught in me unlike the rest Who come here. But I find the place Delightful; there's such ease, and grace, And kindness, and all seem to be On such a high equality. They have not got to think, you know, How far to make the money go. But Frederick says it's less the expense Of money, than of sound good-sense, Quickness to care what others feel, And thoughts with nothing to conceal; Which I'll teach Johnny. Mrs. Vaughan Was waiting for us on the Lawn, And kiss'd and call'd me ‘Cousin.’ Fred Neglected his old friends, she said. He laugh'd, and colour'd up at this. She was, you know, a flame of his; But I'm not jealous! Luncheon done, I left him, who had just begun To talk about the Russian War With an old Lady, Lady Carr,— A Countess, but I'm more afraid, A great deal, of the Lady's Maid,— And went with Mrs. Vaughan to see The pictures, which appear'd to be Of sorts of horses, clowns, and cows Call'd Wouvermans and Cuyps and Dows. And then she took me up, to show Her bedroom, where, long years ago, A Queen slept. 'Tis all tapestries Of Cupids, Gods, and Goddesses, And black, carved oak. A curtain'd door Leads thence into her soft Boudoir, Where even her husband may but come By favour. He, too, has his room, Kept sacred to his solitude. Did I not think the plan was good? She ask'd me; but I said how small Our house was, and that, after all, Though Frederick would not say his prayers At night till I was safe upstairs, I thought it wrong to be so shy Of being good when I was by. ‘Oh, you should humour him!’ she said, With her sweet voice and smile; and led The way to where the children ate Their dinner, and Miss Williams sate. She's only Nursery-Governess, Yet they consider her no less Than Lord or Lady Carr, or me. Just think how happy she must be! The Ball-Room, with its painted sky Where heavy angels seem to fly, Is a dull place; its size and gloom Make them prefer, for drawing-room, The Library, all done up new And comfortable, with a view Of Salisbury Spire between the boughs. When she had shown me through the house, (I wish I could have let her know That she herself was half the show; She is so handsome, and so kind!) She fetch'd the children, who had dined; And, taking one in either hand, Show'd me how all the grounds were plann'd. The lovely garden gently slopes To where a curious bridge of ropes Crosses the Avon to the Park. We rested by the stream, to mark The brown backs of the hovering trout. Frank tickled one, and took it out From under a stone. We saw his owls, And awkward Cochin-China fowls, And shaggy pony in the croft; And then he dragg'd us to a loft, Where pigeons, as he push'd the door, Fann'd clear a breadth of dusty floor, And set us coughing. I confess I trembled for my nice silk dress. I cannot think how Mrs. Vaughan Ventured with that which she had on,— A mere white wrapper, with a few Plain trimmings of a quiet blue, But, oh, so pretty! Then the bell For dinner rang. I look'd quite well (‘Quite charming,’ were the words Fred said,) With the new gown that I've had made. I am so proud of Frederick. He's so high-bred and lordly-like With Mrs. Vaughan! He's not quite so At home with me; but that, you know, I can't expect, or wish. 'Twould hurt, And seem to mock at my desert. Not but that I'm a duteous wife To Fred; but, in another life, Where all are fair that have been true I hope I shall be graceful too, Like Mrs. Vaughan. And, now, good-bye! That happy thought has made me cry, And feel half sorry that my cough, In this fine air, is leaving off. IV FROM FREDERICK TO MRS. GRAHAM Honoria, trebly fair and mild With added loves of lord and child, Is else unalter'd. Years, which wrong The rest, touch not her beauty, young With youth which rather seems her clime, Than aught that's relative to time. How beyond hope was heard the prayer I offer'd in my love's despair! Could any, whilst there's any woe, Be wholly blest, then she were so. She is, and is aware of it, Her husband's endless benefit; But, though their daily ways reveal The depth of private joy they feel, 'Tis not their bearing each to each That does abroad their secret preach, But such a lovely good-intent To all within their government And friendship as, 'tis well discern'd, Each of the other must have learn'd; For no mere dues of neighbourhood Ever begot so blest a mood. And fair, indeed, should be the few God dowers with nothing else to do, And liberal of their light, and free To show themselves, that all may see! For alms let poor men poorly give The meat whereby men's bodies live; But they of wealth are stewards wise Whose graces are their charities. The sunny charm about this home Makes all to shine who thither come. My own dear Jane has caught its grace, And, honour'd, honours too the place. Across the lawn I lately walk'd Alone, and watch'd where mov'd and talk'd, Gentle and goddess-like of air, Honoria and some Stranger fair. I chose a path unblest by these; When one of the two Goddesses, With my Wife's voice, but softer, said, ‘Will you not walk with us, dear Fred?’ She moves, indeed, the modest peer Of all the proudest ladies here. Unawed she talks with men who stand Among the leaders of the land, And women beautiful and wise, With England's greatness in their eyes. To high, traditional good-sense, And knowledge ripe without pretence, And human truth exactly hit By quiet and conclusive wit, Listens my little, homely Dove, Mistakes the points and laughs for love; And, after, stands and combs her hair, And calls me much the wittiest there! With reckless loyalty, dear Wife, She lays herself about my life! The joy I might have had of yore I have not; for 'tis now no more, With me, the lyric time of youth, And sweet sensation of the truth. Yet, past my hope or purpose bless'd, In my chance choice let be confess'd The tenderer Providence that rules The fates of children and of fools! I kiss'd the kind, warm neck that slept, And from her side this morning stepp'd, To bathe my brain from drowsy night In the sharp air and golden light. The dew, like frost, was on the pane. The year begins, though fair, to wane. There is a fragrance in its breath Which is not of the flowers, but death; And green above the ground appear The lilies of another year. I wander'd forth, and took my path Among the bloomless aftermath; And heard the steadfast robin sing As if his own warm heart were Spring, And watch'd him feed where, on the yew, Hung honey'd drops of crimson dew; And then return'd, by walls of peach, And pear-trees bending to my reach, And rose-beds with the roses gone, To bright-laid breakfast. Mrs. Vaughan Was there, none with her. I confess I love her than of yore no less! But she alone was loved of old; Now love is twain, nay, manifold; For, somehow, he whose daily life Adjusts itself to one true wife, Grows to a nuptial, near degree With all that's fair and womanly. Therefore, as more than friends, we met, Without constraint, without regret; The wedded yoke that each had donn'd Seeming a sanction, not a bond. V FROM MRS. GRAHAM Your love lacks joy, your letter says. Yes; love requires the focal space Of recollection or of hope, Ere it can measure its own scope. Too soon, too soon comes Death to show We love more deeply than we know! The rain, that fell upon the height Too gently to be call'd delight, Within the dark vale reappears As a wild cataract of tears; And love in life should strive to see Sometimes what love in death would be! Easier to love, we so should find, It is than to be just and kind. She's gone: shut close the coffin-lid: What distance for another did That death has done for her! The good, Once gazed upon with heedless mood, Now fills with tears the famish'd eye, And turns all else to vanity. 'Tis sad to see, with death between, The good we have pass'd and have not seen! How strange appear the words of all! The looks of those that live appal. They are the ghosts, and check the breath: There's no reality but death, And hunger for some signal given That we shall have our own in heaven. But this the God of love lets be A horrible uncertainty. How great her smallest virtue seems, How small her greatest fault! Ill dreams Were those that foil'd with loftier grace The homely kindness of her face. 'Twas here she sat and work'd, and there She comb'd and kiss'd the children's hair; Or, with one baby at her breast, Another taught, or hush'd to rest. Praise does the heart no more refuse To the chief loveliness of use. Her humblest good is hence most high In the heavens of fond memory; And Love says Amen to the word, A prudent wife is from the Lord. Her worst gown's kept, ('tis now the best, As that in which she oftenest dress'd,) For memory's sake more precious grown Than she herself was for her own. Poor child! foolish it seem'd to fly To sobs instead of dignity, When she was hurt. Now, more than all, Heart-rending and angelical That ignorance of what to do, Bewilder'd still by wrong from you: For what man ever yet had grace Ne'er to abuse his power and place? No magic of her voice or smile Suddenly raised a fairy isle, But fondness for her underwent An unregarded increment, Like that which lifts, through centuries, The coral-reef within the seas, Till, lo! the land where was the wave, Alas! 'tis everywhere her grave. VI FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM Dear Mother, I can surely tell, Now, that I never shall get well. Besides the warning in my mind, All suddenly are grown so kind. Fred stopp'd the Doctor, yesterday, Downstairs, and, when he went away, Came smiling back, and sat with me, Pale, and conversing cheerfully About the Spring, and how my cough, In finer weather, would leave off. I saw it all, and told him plain I felt no hope of Spring again. Then he, after a word of jest, Burst into tears upon my breast, And own'd, when he could speak, he knew There was a little danger, too. This made me very weak and ill, And while, last night, I lay quite still, And, as he fancied, in the deep, Exhausted rest of my short sleep, I heard, or dream'd I heard him pray: ‘Oh, Father, take her not away! ‘Let not life's dear assurance lapse ‘Into death's agonised “Perhaps,” ‘A hope without Thy promise, where ‘Less than assurance is despair! ‘Give me some sign, if go she must, ‘That death's not worse than dust to dust, ‘Not heaven, on whose oblivious shore ‘Joy I may have, but her no more! ‘The bitterest cross, it seems to me, ‘Of all is infidelity; ‘And so, if I may choose, I'll miss ‘The kind of heaven which comes to this. ‘If doom'd, indeed, this fever ceased, ‘To die out wholly, like a beast, ‘Forgetting all life's ill success ‘In dark and peaceful nothingness, ‘I could but say, Thy will be done; ‘For, dying thus, I were but one ‘Of seed innumerable which ne'er ‘In all the worlds shall bloom or bear. ‘I've put life past to so poor use ‘Well may'st Thou life to come refuse; ‘And justice, which the spirit contents, ‘Shall still in me all vain laments; ‘Nay, pleased, I will, while yet I live, ‘Think Thou my forfeit joy may'st give ‘To some fresh life, else unelect, ‘And heaven not feel my poor defect! ‘Only let not Thy method be ‘To make that life, and call it me; ‘Still less to sever mine in twain, ‘And tell each half to live again, ‘And count itself the whole! To die, ‘Is it love's disintegrity? ‘Answer me, “No,” and I, with grace, ‘Will life's brief desolation face, ‘My ways, as native to the clime, ‘Adjusting to the wintry time, ‘Ev'n with a patient cheer thereof—’ He started up, hearing me cough. Oh, Mother, now my last doubt's gone! He likes me more than Mrs. Vaughan; And death, which takes me from his side, Shows me, in very deed, his bride! VII FROM JANE TO FREDERICK I leave this, Dear, for you to read, For strength and hope, when I am dead. When Grace died, I was so perplex'd, I could not find one helpful text; And when, a little while before, I saw her sobbing on the floor, Because I told her that in heaven She would be as the angels even, And would not want her doll, 'tis true A horrible fear within me grew, That, since the preciousness of love Went thus for nothing, mine might prove To be no more, and heaven's bliss Some dreadful good which is not this. But being about to die makes clear Many dark things. I have no fear, Now, that my love, my grief, my joy Is but a passion for a toy. I cannot speak at all, I find, The shining something in my mind, That shows so much that, if I took My thoughts all down, 'twould make a book. God's Word, which lately seem'd above The simpleness of human love, To my death-sharpen'd hearing tells Of little or of nothing else; And many things I hoped were true, When first they came, like songs, from you, Now rise with witness past the reach Of doubt, and I to you can teach, As if with felt authority And as things seen, what you taught me. Yet how? I have no words but those Which every one already knows: As, ‘No man hath at any time ‘Seen God, but 'tis the love of Him ‘Made perfect, and He dwells in us, ‘If we each other love.’ Or thus, ‘My goodness misseth in extent ‘Of Thee, Lord! In the excellent ‘I know Thee; and the Saints on Earth ‘Make all my love and holy mirth.’ And further, ‘Inasmuch as ye ‘Did it to one of these, to Me ‘Ye did it, though ye nothing thought ‘Nor knew of Me, in that ye wrought.’ What shall I dread? Will God undo Our bond, which is all others too? And when I meet you will you say To my reclaiming looks, ‘Away! ‘A dearer love my bosom warms ‘With higher rights and holier charms. ‘The children, whom thou here may'st see, ‘Neighbours that mingle thee and me, ‘And gaily on impartial lyres ‘Renounce the foolish filial fires ‘They felt, with “Praise to God on high, ‘“Goodwill to all else equally;” ‘The trials, duties, service, tears; ‘The many fond, confiding years ‘Of nearness sweet with thee apart; ‘The joy of body, mind, and heart; ‘The love that grew a reckless growth, ‘Unmindful that the marriage-oath ‘To love in an eternal style ‘Meant—only for a little while: ‘Sever'd are now those bonds earth-wrought: ‘All love, not new, stands here for nought!’ Why, it seems almost wicked, Dear, Even to utter such a fear! Are we not ‘heirs,’ as man and wife, ‘Together of eternal life?’ Was Paradise e'er meant to fade, To make which marriage first was made? Neither beneath him nor above Could man in Eden find his Love; Yet with him in the garden walk'd His God, and with Him mildly talk'd! Shall the humble preference offend In heaven, which God did there commend? Are ‘honourable and undefiled’ The names of aught from heaven exiled? And are we not forbid to grieve As without hope? Does God deceive, And call that hope which is despair, Namely, the heaven we should not share? Image and glory of the man, As he of God, is woman. Can This holy, sweet proportion die Into a dull equality? Are we not one flesh, yea, so far More than the babe and mother are, That sons are bid mothers to leave And to their wives alone to cleave, ‘For they two are one flesh?’ But 'tis In the flesh we rise. Our union is, You know 'tis said, ‘great mystery.’ Great mockery, it appears to me; Poor image of the spousal bond Of Christ and Church, if loosed beyond This life!—'Gainst which, and much more yet, There's not a single word to set. The speech to the scoffing Sadducee Is not in point to you and me; For how could Christ have taught such clods That Cæsar's things are also God's? The sort of Wife the Law could make Might well be ‘hated’ for Love's sake, And left, like money, land, or house; For out of Christ is no true spouse. I used to think it strange of Him To make love's after-life so dim, Or only clear by inference: But God trusts much to common sense, And only tells us what, without His Word, we could not have found out. On fleshly tables of the heart He penn'd truth's feeling counterpart In hopes that come to all: so, Dear, Trust these, and be of happy cheer, Nor think that he who has loved well Is of all men most miserable. There's much more yet I want to say, But cannot now. You know my way Of feeling strong from Twelve till Two After my wine. I'll write to you Daily some words, which you shall have To break the silence of the grave. VIII FROM JANE TO FREDERICK You think, perhaps, ‘Ah, could she know How much I loved her!’ Dear, I do! And you may say, ‘Of this new awe ‘Of heart which makes her fancies law, ‘These watchful duties of despair, ‘She does not dream, she cannot care!’ Frederick, you see how false that is, Or how could I have written this? And, should it ever cross your mind That, now and then, you were unkind, You never, never were at all! Remember that! It's natural For one like Mr. Vaughan to come, From a morning's useful pastime, home, And greet, with such a courteous zest, His handsome wife, still newly dress'd, As if the Bird of Paradise Should daily change her plumage thrice. He's always well, she's always gay. Of course! But he who toils all day, And comes home hungry, tired, or cold, And feels 'twould do him good to scold His wife a little, let him trust Her love, and say the things he must, Till sooth'd in mind by meat and rest. If, after that, she's well caress'd, And told how good she is, to bear His humour, fortune makes it fair. Women like men to be like men; That is, at least, just now and then. Thus, I have nothing to forgive, But those first years, (how could I live!) When, though I really did behave So stupidly, you never gave One unkind word or look at all: As if I was some animal You pitied! Now, in later life, You used me like a proper Wife. You feel, Dear, in your present mood, Your Jane, since she was kind and good, A child of God, a living soul, Was not so different, on the whole, From Her who had a little more Of God's best gifts: but, oh, be sure, My dear, dear Love, to take no blame Because you could not feel the same Towards me, living, as when dead. A hungry man must needs think bread So sweet! and, only at their rise And setting, blessings, to the eyes, Like the sun's course, grow visible. If you are sad, remember well, Against delusions of despair, That memory sees things as they were, And not as they were misenjoy'd, And would be still, if ought destroy'd The glory of their hopelessness: So that, in truth, you had me less In days when necessary zeal For my perfection made you feel My faults the most, than now your love Forgets but where it can approve. You gain by loss, if that seem'd small Possess'd, which, being gone, turns all Surviving good to vanity. Oh, Fred, this makes it sweet to die! Say to yourself: ‘'Tis comfort yet ‘I made her that which I regret; ‘And parting might have come to pass ‘In a worse season; as it was, ‘Love an eternal temper took, ‘Dipp'd, glowing, in Death's icy brook!’ Or say, ‘On her poor feeble head ‘This might have fallen: 'tis mine instead! ‘And so great evil sets me free ‘Henceforward from calamity. ‘And, in her little children, too, ‘How much for her I yet can do!’ And grieve not for these orphans even; For central to the love of Heaven Is each child as each star to space. This truth my dying love has grace To trust with a so sure content, I fear I seem indifferent. You must not think a child's small heart Cold, because it and grief soon part. Fanny will keep them all away, Lest you should hear them laugh and play, Before the funeral's over. Then I hope you'll be yourself again, And glad, with all your soul, to find How God thus to the sharpest wind Suits the shorn lambs. Instruct them, Dear, For my sake, in His love and fear. And show how, till their journey's done, Not to be weary they must run. Strive not to dissipate your grief By any lightness. True relief Of sorrow is by sorrow brought. And yet for sorrow's sake, you ought To grieve with measure. Do not spend So good a power to no good end! Would you, indeed, have memory stay In the heart, lock up and put away Relics and likenesses and all Musings, which waste what they recall. True comfort, and the only thing To soothe without diminishing A prized regret, is to match here, By a strict life, God's love severe. Yet, after all, by nature's course, Feeling must lose its edge and force. Again you'll reach the desert tracts Where only sin or duty acts. But, if love always lit our path, Where were the trial of our faith? Oh, should the mournful honeymoon Of death be over strangely soon, And life-long resolutions, made In grievous haste, as quickly fade, Seeming the truth of grief to mock, Think, Dearest, 'tis not by the clock That sorrow goes! A month of tears Is more than many, many years Of common time. Shun, if you can, However, any passionate plan. Grieve with the heart; let not the head Grieve on, when grief of heart is dead; For all the powers of life defy A superstitious constancy. The only bond I hold you to Is that which nothing can undo. A man is not a young man twice; And if, of his young years, he lies A faithful score in one wife's breast, She need not mind who has the rest. In this do what you will, dear Love, And feel quite sure that I approve. And, should it chance as it may be, Give her my wedding-ring from me; And never dream that you can err T'wards me by being good to her; Nor let remorseful thoughts destroy In you the kindly flowering joy And pleasure of the natural life. But don't forget your fond, dead Wife. And, Frederick, should you ever be Tempted to think your love of me All fancy, since it drew its breath So much more sweetly after death, Remember that I never did A single thing you once forbid; All poor folk liked me; and, at the end, Your Cousin call'd me ‘Dearest Friend!’ And, now, 'twill calm your grief to know,— You, who once loved Honoria so,— There's kindness, that's look'd kindly on, Between her Emily and John. Thus, in your children, you will wed! And John seems so much comforted, (Like Isaac when his mother died And fair Rebekah was his bride), By his new hope, for losing me! So all is happiness, you see. And that reminds me how, last night, I dreamt of heaven, with great delight. A strange, kind Lady watch'd my face, Kiss'd me, and cried, ‘His hope found grace!’ She bade me then, in the crystal floor, Look at myself, myself no more; And bright within the mirror shone Honoria's smile, and yet my own! ‘And, when you talk, I hear,’ she sigh'd, ‘How much he loved her! Many a bride ‘In heaven such countersemblance wears ‘Through what Love deem'd rejected prayers.’ She would have spoken still; but, lo, One of a glorious troop, aglow From some great work, towards her came, And she so laugh'd, 'twas such a flame, Aaron's twelve jewels seem'd to mix With the lights of the Seven Candlesticks. IX FROM LADY CLITHEROE TO MRS. GRAHAM My dearest Aunt, the Wedding-day, But for Jane's loss, and you away, Was all a Bride from heaven could beg! Skies bluer than the sparrow's egg, And clearer than the cuckoo's call; And such a sun! the flowers all With double ardour seem'd to blow! The very daisies were a show, Expanded with uncommon pride, Like little pictures of the Bride. Your Great-Niece and your Grandson were Perfection of a pretty pair. How well Honoria's girls turn out, Although they never go about! Dear me, what trouble and expense It took to teach mine confidence! Hers greet mankind as I've heard say That wild things do, where beasts of prey Were never known, nor any men Have met their fearless eyes till then. Their grave, inquiring trust to find All creatures of their simple kind Quite disconcerts bold coxcombry, And makes less perfect candour shy. Ah, Mrs. Graham! people may scoff, But how your home-kept girls go off! How Hymen hastens to unband The waist that ne'er felt waltzer's hand! At last I see my Sister's right, And I've told Maud this very night, (But, oh, my daughters have such wills!) To knit, and only dance quadrilles. You say Fred never writes to you Frankly, as once he used to do, About himself; and you complain He shared with none his grief for Jane. It all comes of the foolish fright Men feel at the word, hypocrite. Although, when first in love, sometimes They rave in letters, talk, and rhymes, When once they find, as find they must. How hard 'tis to be hourly just To those they love, they are dumb for shame, Where we, you see, talk on the same. Honoria, to whose heart alone He seems to open all his own, At times has tears in her kind eyes, After their private colloquies. He's her most favour'd guest, and moves My spleen by his impartial loves. His pleasure has some inner spring Depending not on anything. Petting our Polly, none e'er smiled More fondly on his favourite child; Yet, playing with his own, it is Somehow as if it were not his. He means to go again to sea, Now that the wedding's over. He Will leave to Emily and John The little ones to practise on; And Major-domo, Mrs. Rouse, A deal old soul from Wilton House, Will scold the housemaids and the cook, Till Emily has learn'd to look A little braver than a lamb Surprised by dogs without its dam! Do, dear Aunt, use your influence, And try to teach some plain good sense To Mary. 'Tis not yet too late To make her change her chosen state Of single silliness. In truth, I fancy that, with fading youth, Her will now wavers. Yesterday, Though, till the Bride was gone away, Joy shone from Mary's loving heart, I found her afterwards apart, Hysterically sobbing. I Knew much too well to ask her why. This marrying of Nieces daunts The bravest souls of maiden Aunts. Though Sisters' children often blend Sweetly the bonds of child and friend, They are but reeds to rest upon. When Emily comes back with John, Her right to go downstairs before Aunt Mary will but be the more Observed if kindly waived, and how Shall these be as they were, when now Niece has her John, and Aunt the sense Of her superior innocence? Somehow, all loves, however fond, Prove lieges of the nuptial bond; And she who dares at this to scoff, Finds all the rest in time drop off; While marriage, like a mushroom-ring, Spreads its sure circle every Spring. She twice refused George Vane, you know; Yet, when he died three years ago In the Indian war, she put on gray, And wears no colours to this day. And she it is who charges me, Dear Aunt, with ‘inconsistency!’ X FROM FREDERICK TO HONORIA Cousin, my thoughts no longer try To cast the fashion of the sky. Imagination can extend Scarcely in part to comprehend The sweetness of our common food Ambrosial, which ingratitude And impious inadvertence waste, Studious to eat but not to taste. And who can tell what's yet in store There, but that earthly things have more Of all that makes their inmost bliss, And life's an image still of this, But haply such a glorious one As is the rainbow of the sun? Sweet are your words, but, after all Their mere reversal may befall The partners of His glories who Daily is crucified anew: Splendid privations, martyrdoms To which no weak remission comes, Perpetual passion for the good Of them that feel no gratitude, Far circlings, as of planets' fires, Round never-to-be-reach'd desires, Whatever rapturously sighs That life is love, love sacrifice. All I am sure of heaven is this: Howe'er the mode, I shall not miss One true delight which I have known. Not on the changeful earth alone Shall loyalty remain unmoved T'wards everything I ever loved. So Heaven's voice calls, like Rachel's voice To Jacob in the field, ‘Rejoice! ‘Serve on some seven more sordid years, ‘Too short for weariness or tears; ‘Serve on; then, oh, Beloved, well-tried, ‘Take me for ever as thy Bride!’ XI FROM MARY CHURCHILL TO THE DEAN Charles does me honour, but 'twere vain To reconsider now again, And so to doubt the clear-shown truth I sought for, and received, when youth, Being fair, and woo'd by one whose love Was lovely, fail'd my mind to move. God bids them by their own will go, Who ask again the things they know! I grieve for my infirmity, And ignorance of how to be Faithful, at once, to the heavenly life, And the fond duties of a wife. Narrow am I and want the art To love two things with all my heart. Occupied singly in His search, Who, in the Mysteries of the Church, Returns, and calls them Clouds of Heaven, I tread a road, straight, hard, and even; But fear to wander all confused, By two-fold fealty abused. Either should I the one forget, Or scantly pay the other's debt. You bid me, Father, count the cost. I have; and all that must be lost I feel as only woman can. To make the heart's wealth of some man, And through the untender world to move, Wrapt safe in his superior love, How sweet! How sweet the household round Of duties, and their narrow bound, So plain, that to transgress were hard, Yet full of manifest reward! The charities not marr'd, like mine, With chance of thwarting laws divine; The world's regards and just delight In one that's clearly, kindly right, How sweet! Dear Father, I endure, Not without sharp regret, be sure, To give up such glad certainty, For what, perhaps, may never be. For nothing of my state I know, But that t'ward heaven I seem to go, As one who fondly landward hies Along a deck that seaward flies. With every year, meantime, some grace Of earthly happiness gives place To humbling ills, the very charms Of youth being counted, henceforth, harms: To blush already seems absurd; Nor know I whether I should herd With girls or wives, or sadlier balk Maids' merriment or matrons' talk. But strait's the gate of life! O'er late, Besides, 'twere now to change my fate: For flowers and fruit of love to form, It must be Spring as well as warm. The world's delight my soul dejects, Revenging all my disrespects Of old, with incapacity To chime with even its harmless glee, Which sounds, from fields beyond my range, Like fairies' music, thin and strange. With something like remorse, I grant The world has beauty which I want; And if, instead of judging it, I at its Council chance to sit, Or at its gay and order'd Feast, My place seems lower than the least. The conscience of the life to be Smites me with inefficiency, And makes me all unfit to bless With comfortable earthliness The rest-desiring brain of man. Finally, then, I fix my plan To dwell with Him that dwells apart In the highest heaven and lowliest heart; Nor will I, to my utter loss, Look to pluck roses from the Cross. As for the good of human love, 'Twere countercheck almost enough To think that one must die before The other; and perhaps 'tis more In love's last interest to do Nought the least contrary thereto, Than to be blest, and be unjust, Or suffer injustice; as they must, Without a miracle, whose pact Compels to mutual life and act, Whether love shines, or darkness sleeps Cold on the spirit's changeful deeps. Enough if, to my earthly share, Fall gleams that keep me from despair. Happy the things we here discern; More happy those for which we yearn; But measurelessly happy above All else are those we guess not of! XII FROM FELIX TO HONORIA Dearest, my Love and Wife, 'tis long Ago I closed the unfinish'd song Which never could be finish'd; nor Will ever Poet utter more Of love than I did, watching well To lure to speech the unspeakable! ‘Why, having won her, do I woo?’ That final strain to the last height flew Of written joy, which wants the smile And voice that are, indeed, the while They last, the very things you speak, Honoria, who mak'st music weak With ways that say, ‘Shall I not be ‘As kind to all as Heaven to me?’ And yet, ah, twenty-fold my Bride! Rising, this twentieth festal-tide, You still soft sleeping, on this day Of days, some words I long to say, Some words superfluously sweet Of fresh assurance, thus to greet Your waking eyes, which never grow Weary of telling what I know So well, yet only well enough To wish for further news thereof. Here, in this early autumn dawn, By windows opening on the lawn, Where sunshine seems asleep, though bright, And shadows yet are sharp with night, And, further on, the wealthy wheat Bends in a golden drowse, how sweet To sit and cast my careless looks Around my walls of well-read books, Wherein is all that stands redeem'd From time's huge wreck, all men have dream'd Of truth, and all by poets known Of feeling, and in weak sort shown, And, turning to my heart again, To find I have what makes them vain, The thanksgiving mind, which wisdom sums, And you, whereby it freshly comes As on that morning, (can there be Twenty-two years 'twixt it and me?) When, thrill'd with hopeful love I rose And came in haste to Sarum Close, Past many a homestead slumbering white In lonely and pathetic light, Merely to fancy which drawn blind Of thirteen had my Love behind, And in her sacred neighbourhood To feel that sweet scorn of all good But her, which let the wise forfend When wisdom learns to comprehend! Dearest, as each returning May I see the season new and gay With new joy and astonishment, And Nature's infinite ostent Of lovely flowers in wood and mead, That weet not whether any heed, So see I, daily wondering, you, And worship with a passion new The Heaven that visibly allows Its grace to go about my house, The partial Heaven, that, though I err And mortal am, gave all to her Who gave herself to me. Yet I Boldly thank Heaven, (and so defy The beggarly soul'd humbleness Which fears God's bounty to confess,) That I was fashion'd with a mind Seeming for this great gift design'd, So naturally it moved above All sordid contraries of love, Strengthen'd in youth with discipline Of light, to follow the divine Vision, (which ever to the dark Is such a plague as was the ark In Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron,) still Discerning with the docile will Which comes of full persuaded thought, That intimacy in love is nought Without pure reverence, whereas this, In tearfullest banishment, is bliss. And so, dearest Honoria, I Have never learn'd the weary sigh Of those that to their love-feasts went, Fed, and forgot the Sacrament; And not a trifle now occurs But sweet initiation stirs Of new-discover'd joy, and lends To feeling change that never ends; And duties, which the many irk, Are made all wages and no work. How sing of such things save to her, Love's self, so love's interpreter? How the supreme rewards confess Which crown the austere voluptuousness Of heart, that earns, in midst of wealth, The appetite of want and health, Relinquishes the pomp of life And beauty to the pleasant Wife At home, and does all joy despise As out of place but in her eyes? How praise the years and gravity That make each favour seem to be A lovelier weakness for her lord? And, ah, how find the tender word To tell aright of love that glows The fairer for the fading rose? Of frailty which can weight the arm To lean with thrice its girlish charm? Of grace which, like this autumn day, Is not the sad one of decay, Yet one whose pale brow pondereth The far-off majesty of death? How tell the crowd, whom passion rends, That love grows mild as it ascends? That joy's most high and distant mood Is lost, not found in dancing blood; Albeit kind acts and smiling eyes, And all those fond realities Which are love's words, in us mean more Delight than twenty years before? How, Dearest, finish, without wrong To the speechless heart, the unfinish'd song, Its high, eventful passages Consisting, say, of things like these:— One morning, contrary to law, Which, for the most, we held in awe, Commanding either not to intrude On the other's place of solitude Or solitary mind, for fear Of coming there when God was near, And finding so what should be known To Him who is merciful alone, And views the working ferment base Of waking flesh and sleeping grace, Not as we view, our kindness check'd By likeness of our own defect, I, venturing to her room, because (Mark the excuse!) my Birthday 'twas, Saw, here across a careless chair, A ball-dress flung, as light as air, And, here, beside a silken couch, Pillows which did the pressure vouch Of pious knees, (sweet piety! Of goodness made and charity, If gay looks told the heart's glad sense, Much rather than of penitence,) And, on the couch, an open book, And written list—I did not look, Yet just in her clear writing caught:— ‘Habitual faults of life and thought ‘Which most I need deliverance from.’ I turn'd aside, and saw her come Adown the filbert-shaded way, Beautified with her usual gay Hypocrisy of perfectness, Which made her heart, and mine no less, So happy! And she cried to me, ‘You lose by breaking rules, you see! ‘Your Birthday treat is now half-gone ‘Of seeing my new ball-dress on.’ And, meeting so my lovely Wife, A passing pang, to think that life Was mortal, when I saw her laugh, Shaped in my mind this epitaph: ‘Faults had she, child of Adam's stem, ‘But only Heaven knew of them.’ Or thus: For many a dreadful day, In sea-side lodgings sick she lay, Noteless of love, nor seem'd to hear The sea, on one side, thundering near, Nor, on the other, the loud Ball Held nightly in the public hall; Nor vex'd they my short slumbers, though I woke up if she breathed too low. Thus, for three months, with terrors rife, The pending of her precious life I watch'd o'er; and the danger, at last, The kind Physician said, was past. Howbeit, for seven harsh weeks the East Breathed witheringly, and Spring's growth ceased, And so she only did not die; Until the bright and blighting sky Changed into cloud, and the sick flowers Remember'd their perfumes, and showers Of warm, small rain refreshing flew Before the South, and the Park grew, In three nights, thick with green. Then she Revived, no less than flower and tree, In the mild air, and, the fourth day, Look'd supernaturally gay With large, thanksgiving eyes, that shone, The while I tied her bonnet on, So that I led her to the glass, And bade her see how fair she was, And how love visibly could shine. Profuse of hers, desiring mine, And mindful I had loved her most When beauty seem'd a vanish'd boast, She laugh'd. I press'd her then to me, Nothing but soft humility; Nor e'er enhanced she with such charms Her acquiescence in my arms. And, by her sweet love-weakness made Courageous, powerful, and glad, In a clear illustration high Of heavenly affection, I Perceived that utter love is all The same as to be rational, And that the mind and heart of love, Which think they cannot do enough, Are truly the everlasting doors Wherethrough, all unpetition'd, pours The eternal pleasance. Wherefore we Had innermost tranquillity, And breathed one life with such a sense Of friendship and of confidence, That, recollecting the sure word: ‘If two of you are in accord, ‘On earth, as touching any boon ‘Which ye shall ask, it shall be done ‘In heaven,’ we ask'd that heaven's bliss Might ne'er be any less than this; And, for that hour, we seem'd to have The secret of the joy we gave. How sing of such things, save to her, Love's self, so love's interpreter? How read from such a homely page In the ear of this unhomely age? 'Tis now as when the Prophet cried: ‘The nation hast Thou multiplied, ‘But Thou hast not increased the joy!’ And yet, ere wrath or rot destroy Of England's state the ruin fair, Oh, might I so its charm declare, That, in new Lands, in far-off years, Delighted he should cry that hears: ‘Great is the Land that somewhat best ‘Works, to the wonder of the rest! ‘We, in our day, have better done ‘This thing or that than any one; ‘And who but, still admiring, sees ‘How excellent for images ‘Was Greece, for laws how wise was Rome; ‘But read this Poet, and say if home ‘And private love did e'er so smile ‘As in that ancient English isle!’ XIII FROM LADY CLITHEROE TO EMILY GRAHAM My dearest Niece, I'm charm'd to hear The scenery's fine at Windermere, And glad a six-weeks' wife defers In the least to wisdom not yet hers. But, Child, I've no advice to give! Rules only make it hard to live. And where's the good of having been Well taught from seven to seventeen, If, married, you may not leave off, And say, at last, ‘I'm good enough!’ Weeding out folly, still leave some. It gives both lightness and aplomb. We know, however wise by rule, Woman is still by nature fool; And men have sense to like her all The more when she is natural. 'Tis true that, if we choose, we can Mock to a miracle the man; But iron in the fire red hot, Though 'tis the heat, the fire 'tis not: And who, for such a feint, would pledge The babe's and woman's privilege, No duties and a thousand rights? Besides, defect love's flow incites, As water in a well will run Only the while 'tis drawn upon. ‘Point de culte sans mystère,’ you say, ‘And what if that should die away?’ Child, never fear that either could Pull from Saint Cupid's face the hood. The follies natural to each Surpass the other's moral reach. Just think how men, with sword and gun, Will really fight, and never run; And all in sport: they would have died, For sixpence more, on the other side! A woman's heart must ever warm At such odd ways: and so we charm By strangeness which, the more they mark, The more men get into the dark. The marvel, by familiar life, Grows, and attaches to the wife By whom it grows. Thus, silly Girl, To John you'll always be the pearl In the oyster of the universe; And, though in time he'll treat you worse, He'll love you more, you need not doubt, And never, never find you out! My Dear, I know that dreadful thought That you've been kinder than you ought. It almost makes you hate him! Yet 'Tis wonderful how men forget, And how a merciful Providence Deprives our husbands of all sense Of kindness past, and makes them deem We always were what now we seem. For their own good we must, you know, However plain the way we go, Still make it strange with stratagem; And instinct tells us that, to them, 'Tis always right to bate their price. Yet I must say they're rather nice, And, oh, so easily taken in To cheat them almost seems a sin! And, Dearest, 'twould be most unfair To John your feelings to compare With his, or any man's; for she Who loves at all loves always; he, Who loves far more, loves yet by fits, And when the wayward wind remits To blow, his feelings faint and drop Like forge-flames when the bellows stop. Such things don't trouble you at all When once you know they're natural. My love to John; and, pray, my Dear, Don't let me see you for a year; Unless, indeed, ere then you've learn'd That Beauties wed are blossoms turn'd To unripe codlings, meant to dwell In modest shadow hidden well, Till this green stage again permute To glow of flowers with good of fruit. I will not have my patience tried By your absurd new-married pride, That scorns the world's slow-gather'd sense, Ties up the hands of Providence, Rules babes, before there's hope of one, Better than mothers e'er have done, And, for your poor particular, Neglects delights and graces far Beyond your crude and thin conceit. Age has romance almost as sweet And much more generous than this Of yours and John's. With all the bliss Of the evenings when you coo'd with him, And upset home for your sole whim, You might have envied, were you wise, The tears within your Mother's eyes, Which, I dare say, you did not see. But let that pass! Yours yet will be, I hope, as happy, kind, and true As lives which now seem void to you. Have you not seen shop-painters paste Their gold in sheets, then rub to waste Full half, and, lo, you read the name? Well, Time, my Dear, does much the same With this unmeaning glare of love. But, though you yet may much improve, In marriage, be it still confess'd, There's little merit at the best. Some half-a-dozen lives, indeed, Which else would not have had the need, Get food and nurture, as the price Of antedated Paradise; But what's that to the varied want Succour'd by Mary, your dear Aunt, Who put the bridal crown thrice by, For that of which virginity, So used, has hope? She sends her love, As usual with a proof thereof— Papa's discourse, which you, no doubt, Heard none of, neatly copied out Whilst we were dancing. All are well, Adieu, for there's the Luncheon Bell. THE WEDDING SERMON I The truths of Love are like the sea For clearness and for mystery. Of that sweet love which, startling, wakes Maiden and Youth, and mostly breaks The word of promise to the ear, But keeps it, after many a year, To the full spirit, how shall I speak? My memory with age is weak, And I for hopes do oft suspect The things I seem to recollect. Yet who but must remember well 'Twas this made heaven intelligible As motive, though 'twas small the power The heart might have, for even an hour, To hold possession of the height Of nameless pathos and delight! 2 In Godhead rise, thither flow back All loves, which, as they keep or lack, In their return, the course assign'd, Are virtue or sin. Love's every kind, Lofty or low, of spirit or sense, Desire is, or benevolence. He who is fairer, better, higher Than all His works, claims all desire, And in His Poor, His Proxies, asks Our whole benevolence: He tasks, Howbeit, His People by their powers; And if, my Children, you, for hours, Daily, untortur'd in the heart, Can worship, and time's other part Give, without rough recoils of sense, To the claims ingrate of indigence, Happy are you, and fit to be Wrought to rare heights of sanctity, For the humble to grow humbler at. But if the flying spirit falls flat, After the modest spell of prayer That saves the day from sin and care, And the upward eye a void descries, And praises are hypocrisies, And, in the soul, o'erstrain'd for grace, A godless anguish grows apace; Or, if impartial charity Seems, in the act, a sordid lie, Do not infer you cannot please God, or that He His promises Postpones, but be content to love No more than He accounts enough. Account them poor enough who want Any good thing which you can grant; And fathom well the depths of life In loves of Husband and of Wife, Child, Mother, Father; simple keys To what cold faith calls mysteries. 3 The love of marriage claims, above All other kinds, the name of love, As perfectest, though not so high As love which Heaven with single eye Considers. Equal and entire, Therein benevolence, desire, Elsewhere ill-join'd or found apart, Become the pulses of one heart, Which now contracts, and now dilates, And, both to the height exalting, mates Self-seeking to self-sacrifice. Nay, in its subtle paradise (When purest) this one love unites All modes of these two opposites, All balanced in accord so rich Who may determine which is which? Chiefly God's Love does in it live, And nowhere else so sensitive; For each is all that the other's eye, In the vague vast of Deity, Can comprehend and so contain As still to touch and ne'er to strain The fragile nerves of joy. And then 'Tis such a wise goodwill to men And politic economy As in a prosperous State we see, Where every plot of common land Is yielded to some private hand To fence about and cultivate. Does narrowness its praise abate? Nay, the infinite of man is found But in the beating of its bound, And, if a brook its banks o'erpass, 'Tis not a sea, but a morass. 4 No giddiest hope, no wildest guess Of Love's most innocent loftiness Had dared to dream of its own worth, Till Heaven's bold sun-gleam lit the earth. Christ's marriage with the Church is more, My Children, than a metaphor. The heaven of heavens is symbol'd where The torch of Psyche flash'd despair. But here I speak of heights, and heights Are hardly scaled. The best delights Of even this homeliest passion, are In the most perfect souls so rare, That they who feel them are as men Sailing the Southern ocean, when, At midnight, they look up, and eye The starry Cross, and a strange sky Of brighter stars; and sad thoughts come To each how far he is from home. 5 Love's inmost nuptial sweetness see In the doctrine of virginity! Could lovers, at their dear wish, blend, 'Twould kill the bliss which they intend; For joy is love's obedience Against the law of natural sense; And those perpetual yearnings sweet Of lives which dream that they can meet Are given that lovers never may Be without sacrifice to lay On the high altar of true love, With tears of vestal joy. To move Frantic, like comets to our bliss, Forgetting that we always miss, And so to seek and fly the sun, By turns, around which love should run, Perverts the ineffable delight Of service guerdon'd with full sight And pathos of a hopeless want, To an unreal victory's vaunt, And plaint of an unreal defeat. Yet no less dangerous misconceit May also be of the virgin will, Whose goal is nuptial blessing still, And whose true being doth subsist, There where the outward forms are miss'd, In those who learn and keep the sense Divine of ‘due benevolence,’ Seeking for aye, without alloy Of selfish thought, another's joy, And finding in degrees unknown That which in act they shunn'd, their own. For all delights of earthly love Are shadows of the heavens, and move As other shadows do; they flee From him that follows them; and he Who flies, for ever finds his feet Embraced by their pursuings sweet. 6 Then, even in love humane, do I Not counsel aspirations high, So much as sweet and regular Use of the good in which we are. As when a man along the ways Walks, and a sudden music plays, His step unchanged, he steps in time, So let your Grace with Nature chime. Her primal forces burst, like straws, The bonds of uncongenial laws. Right life is glad as well as just, And, rooted strong in ‘This I must,’ It bears aloft the blossom gay And zephyr-toss'd, of ‘This I may;’ Whereby the complex heavens rejoice In fruits of uncommanded choice. Be this your rule: seeking delight, Esteem success the test of right; For 'gainst God's will much may be done, But nought enjoy'd, and pleasures none Exist, but, like to springs of steel, Active no longer than they feel The checks that make them serve the soul, They take their vigour from control. A man need only keep but well The Church's indispensable First precepts, and she then allows, Nay, more, she bids him, for his spouse, Leave even his heavenly Father's awe, At times, and His immaculate law, Construed in its extremer sense. Jehovah's mild magnipotence Smiles to behold His children play In their own free and childish way, And can His fullest praise descry In the exuberant liberty Of those who, having understood The glory of the Central Good, And how souls ne'er may match or merge, But as they thitherward converge, Take in love's innocent gladness part With infantine, untroubled heart, And faith that, straight t'wards heaven's far Spring, Sleeps, like the swallow, on the wing. 7 Lovers, once married, deem their bond Then perfect, scanning nought beyond For love to do but to sustain The spousal hour's delighted gain. But time and a right life alone Fulfil the promise then foreshown. The Bridegroom and the Bride withal Are but unwrought material Of marriage; nay, so far is love, Thus crown'd, from being thereto enough, Without the long, compulsive awe Of duty, that the bond of law Does oftener marriage-love evoke, Than love, which does not wear the yoke Of legal vows, submits to be Self-rein'd from ruinous liberty. Lovely is love; but age well knows 'Twas law which kept the lover's vows Inviolate through the year or years Of worship pieced with panic fears, When she who lay within his breast Seem'd of all women perhaps the best, But not the whole, of womankind, Or love, in his yet wayward mind, Had ghastly doubts its precious life Was pledged for aye to the wrong wife. Could it be else? A youth pursues A maid, whom chance, not he, did choose, Till to his strange arms hurries she In a despair of modesty. Then, simply and without pretence Of insight or experience, They plight their vows. The parents say ‘We cannot speak them yea or nay; ‘The thing proceedeth from the Lord!’ And wisdom still approves their word; For God created so these two They match as well as others do That take more pains, and trust Him less Who never fails, if ask'd, to bless His children's helpless ignorance And blind election of life's chance. Verily, choice not matters much, If but the woman's truly such, And the young man has led the life Without which how shall e'er the wife Be the one woman in the world? Love's sensitive tendrils sicken, curl'd Round folly's former stay; for 'tis The doom of all unsanction'd bliss To mock some good that, gain'd, keeps still The taint of the rejected ill. 8 Howbeit, though both were perfect, she Of whom the maid was prophecy As yet lives not, and Love rebels Against the law of any else; And, as a steed takes blind alarm, Disowns the rein, and hunts his harm, So, misdespairing word and act May now perturb the happiest pact. The more, indeed, is love, the more Peril to love is now in store. Against it nothing can be done But only this: leave ill alone! Who tries to mend his wife succeeds As he who knows not what he needs. He much affronts a worth as high As his, and that equality Of spirits in which abide the grace And joy of her subjected place; And does the still growth check and blurr Of contraries, confusing her Who better knows what he desires Than he, and to that mark aspires With perfect zeal, and a deep wit Which nothing helps but trusting it. So, loyally o'erlooking all In which love's promise short may fall Of full performance, honour that As won, which aye love worketh at! It is but as the pedigree Of perfectness which is to be That our best good can honour claim; Yet honour to deny were shame And robbery; for it is the mould Wherein to beauty runs the gold Of good intention, and the prop That lifts to the sun the earth-drawn crop Of human sensibilities. Such honour, with a conduct wise In common things, as, not to steep The lofty mind of love in sleep Of over much familiarness; Not to degrade its kind caress, As those do that can feel no more, So give themselves to pleasures o'er; Not to let morning-sloth destroy The evening-flower, domestic joy; Not by uxoriousness to chill The warm devotion of her will Who can but half her love confer On him that cares for nought but her;— These, and like obvious prudences Observed, he's safest that relies, For the hope she will not always seem, Caught, but a laurel or a stream, On time; on her unsearchable Love-wisdom; on their work done well, Discreet with mutual aid; on might Of shared affliction and delight; On pleasures that so childish be They're 'shamed to let the children see, By which life keeps the valleys low Where love does naturally grow; On much whereof hearts have account, Though heads forget; on babes, chief fount Of union, and for which babes are No less than this for them, nay far More, for the bond of man and wife To the very verge of future life Strengthens, and yearns for brighter day, While others, with their use, decay; And, though true marriage purpose keeps Of offspring, as the centre sleeps Within the wheel, transmitting thence Fury to the circumference, Love's self the noblest offspring is, And sanction of the nuptial kiss; Lastly, on either's primal curse, Which help and sympathy reverse To blessings. 9 God, who may be well Jealous of His chief miracle, Bids sleep the meddling soul of man, Through the long process of this plan, Whereby, from his unweeting side, The Wife's created, and the Bride, That chance one of her strange, sweet sex He to his glad life did annex, Grows more and more, by day and night, The one in the whole world opposite Of him, and in her nature all So suited and reciprocal To his especial form of sense, Affection, and intelligence, That, whereas love at first had strange Relapses into lust of change, It now finds (wondrous this, but true!) The long-accustom'd only new, And the untried common; and, whereas An equal seeming danger was Of likeness lacking joy and force, Or difference reaching to divorce, Now can the finish'd lover see Marvel of me most far from me, Whom without pride he may admire, Without Narcissus' doom desire, Serve without selfishness, and love ‘Even as himself,’ in sense above Niggard ‘as much,’ yea, as she is The only part of him that's his. 10 I do not say love's youth returns; That joy which so divinely yearns! But just esteem of present good Shows all regret such gratitude As if the sparrow in her nest, Her woolly young beneath her breast, Should these despise, and sorrow for Her five blue eggs that are no more. Nor say I the fruit has quite the scope Of the flower's spiritual hope. Love's best is service, and of this, Howe'er devout, use dulls the bliss. Though love is all of earth that's dear, Its home, my Children, is not here: The pathos of eternity Does in its fullest pleasure sigh. Be grateful and most glad thereof. Parting, as 'tis, is pain enough. If love, by joy, has learn'd to give Praise with the nature sensitive, At last, to God, we then possess The end of mortal happiness, And henceforth very well may wait The unbarring of the golden gate, Wherethrough, already, faith can see That apter to each wish than we Is God, and curious to bless Better than we devise or guess; Not without condescending craft To disappoint with bliss, and waft Our vessels frail, when worst He mocks The heart with breakers and with rocks, To happiest havens. You have heard Your bond death-sentenced by His Word. What, if, in heaven, the name be o'er, Because the thing is so much more? All are, 'tis writ, as angels there, Nor male nor female. Each a stair In the hierarchical ascent Of active and recipient Affections, what if all are both By turn, as they themselves betroth To adoring what is next above, Or serving what's below their love? Of this we are certified, that we Are shaped here for eternity, So that a careless word will make Its dint upon the form we take For ever. If, then, years have wrought Two strangers to become, in thought, Will, and affection, but one man For likeness, as none others can, Without like process, shall this tree The king of all the forest, be, Alas, the only one of all That shall not lie where it doth fall? Shall this unflagging flame, here nurs'd By everything, yea, when reversed, Blazing, in fury, brighter, wink, Flicker, and into darkness shrink, When all else glows, baleful or brave, In the keen air beyond the grave? Beware; for fiends in triumph laugh O'er him who learns the truth by half! Beware; for God will not endure For men to make their hope more pure Than His good promise, or require Another than the five-string'd lyre Which He has vow'd again to the hands Devout of him who understands To tune it justly here! Beware The Powers of Darkness and the Air, Which lure to empty heights man's hope, Bepraising heaven's ethereal cope, But covering with their cloudy cant Its ground of solid adamant, That strengthens ether for the flight Of angels, makes and measures height, And in materiality Exceeds our Earth's in such degree As all else Earth exceeds! Do I Here utter aught too dark or high? Have you not seen a bird's beak slay Proud Psyche, on a summer's day? Down fluttering drop the frail wings four, Missing the weight which made them soar. Spirit is heavy nature's wing, And is not rightly anything Without its burthen, whereas this, Wingless, at least a maggot is, And, wing'd, is honour and delight Increasing endlessly with height. 11 If unto any here that chance Fell not, which makes a month's romance, Remember, few wed whom they would. And this, like all God's laws, is good; For nought's so sad, the whole world o'er, As much love which has once been more. Glorious for light is the earliest love; But worldly things, in the rays thereof, Extend their shadows, every one False as the image which the sun At noon or eve dwarfs or protracts. A perilous lamp to light men's acts! By Heaven's kind, impartial plan, Well-wived is he that's truly man If but the woman's womanly, As such a man's is sure to be. Joy of all eyes and pride of life Perhaps she is not; the likelier wife! If it be thus; if you have known, (As who has not?) some heavenly one, Whom the dull background of despair Help'd to show forth supremely fair; If memory, still remorseful, shapes Young Passion bringing Eshcol grapes To travellers in the Wilderness, This truth will make regret the less: Mighty in love as graces are, God's ordinance is mightier far; And he who is but just and kind And patient, shall for guerdon find, Before long, that the body's bond Is all else utterly beyond In power of love to actualise The soul's bond which it signifies, And even to deck a wife with grace External in the form and face. A five years' wife, and not yet fair? Blame let the man, not Nature, bear! For, as the sun, warming a bank Where last year's grass droops gray and dank, Evokes the violet, bids disclose In yellow crowds the fresh primrose, And foxglove hang her flushing head, So vernal love, where all seems dead, Makes beauty abound. Then was that nought, That trance of joy beyond all thought, The vision, in one, of womanhood? Nay, for all women holding good, Should marriage such a prologue want, 'Twere sordid and most ignorant Profanity; but, having this, 'Tis honour now, and future bliss; For where is he that, knowing the height And depth of ascertain'd delight, Inhumanly henceforward lies Content with mediocrities! THE UNKNOWN EROS “Deliciæ meæ esse cum filiis hominum.” Prov. VIII. 31. PROEM ‘Many speak wisely, some inerrably: Witness the beast who talk'd that should have bray'd, And Caiaphas that said Expedient 'twas for all that One should die; But what avails When Love's right accent from their wisdom fails, And the Truth-criers know not what they cry! Say, wherefore thou, As under bondage of some bitter vow, Warblest no word, When all the rest are shouting to be heard? Why leave the fervid running just when Fame 'Gan whispering of thy name Amongst the hard-pleased Judges of the Course? Parch'd is thy crystal-flowing source? Pierce, then, with thought's steel probe, the trodden ground, Till passion's buried floods be found; Intend thine eye Into the dim and undiscover'd sky Whose lustres are the pulsings of the heart, And promptly, as thy trade is, watch to chart The lonely suns, the mystic hazes and throng'd sparkles bright That, named and number'd right In sweet, transpicuous words, shall glow alway With Love's three-stranded ray, Red wrath, compassion golden, lazuline delight.’ Thus in reproof of my despondency, My Mentor; and thus I: O, season strange for song! And yet some timely power persuades my lips. Is't England's parting soul that nerves my tongue, As other Kingdoms, nearing their eclipse, Have, in their latest bards, uplifted strong The voice that was their voice in earlier days? Is it her sudden, loud and piercing cry, The note which those that seem too weak to sigh Will sometimes utter just before they die? Lo, weary of the greatness of her ways, There lies my Land, with hasty pulse and hard, Her ancient beauty marr'd, And, in her cold and aimless roving sight, Horror of light; Sole vigour left in her last lethargy, Save when, at bidding of some dreadful breath, The rising death Rolls up with force; And then the furiously gibbering corse Shakes, panglessly convuls'd, and sightless stares, Whilst one Physician pours in rousing wines, One anodynes, And one declares That nothing ails it but the pains of growth. My last look loth Is taken; and I turn, with the relief Of knowing that my life-long hope and grief Are surely vain, To that unshapen time to come, when She, A dim, heroic Nation long since dead, The foulness of her agony forgot, Shall all benignly shed Through ages vast The ghostly grace of her transfigured past Over the present, harass'd and forlorn, Of nations yet unborn; And this shall be the lot Of those who, in the bird-voice and the blast Of her omniloquent tongue, Have truly sung Or greatly said, To shew as one With those who have best done, And be as rays, Thro' the still altering world, around her changeless head. Therefore no 'plaint be mine Of listeners none, No hope of render'd use or proud reward, In hasty times and hard; But chants as of a lonely thrush's throat At latest eve, That does in each calm note Both joy and grieve; Notes few and strong and fine, Gilt with sweet day's decline, And sad with promise of a different sun. 'Mid the loud concert harsh Of this fog-folded marsh, To me, else dumb, Uranian Clearness, come! Give me to breathe in peace and in surprise The light-thrill'd ether of your rarest skies, Till inmost absolution start The welling in the grateful eyes, The heaving in the heart. Winnow with sighs And wash away With tears the dust and stain of clay, Till all the Song be Thine, as beautiful as Morn, Bedeck'd with shining clouds of scorn; And Thou, Inspirer, deign to brood O'er the delighted words, and call them Very Good. This grant, Clear Spirit; and grant that I remain Content to ask unlikely gifts in vain. BOOK I I SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY Well dost thou, Love, thy solemn Feast to hold In vestal February; Not rather choosing out some rosy day From the rich coronet of the coming May, When all things meet to marry! O, quick, prævernal Power That signall'st punctual through the sleepy mould The Snowdrop's time to flower, Fair as the rash oath of virginity Which is first-love's first cry; O, Baby Spring, That flutter'st sudden 'neath the breast of Earth A month before the birth; Whence is the peaceful poignancy, The joy contrite, Sadder than sorrow, sweeter than delight, That burthens now the breath of everything, Though each one sighs as if to each alone The cherish'd pang were known? At dusk of dawn, on his dark spray apart, With it the Blackbird breaks the young Day's heart; In evening's hush About it talks the heavenly-minded Thrush; The hill with like remorse Smiles to the Sun's smile in his westering course; The fisher's drooping skiff In yonder sheltering bay; The choughs that call about the shining cliff; The children, noisy in the setting ray; Own the sweet season, each thing as it may; Thoughts of strange kindness and forgotten peace In me increase; And tears arise Within my happy, happy Mistress' eyes, And, lo, her lips, averted from my kiss, Ask from Love's bounty, ah, much more than bliss! Is't the sequester'd and exceeding sweet Of dear Desire electing his defeat? Is't the waked Earth now to yon purpling cope Uttering first-love's first cry, Vainly renouncing, with a Seraph's sigh, Love's natural hope? Fair-meaning Earth, foredoom'd to perjury! Behold, all amorous May, With roses heap'd upon her laughing brows, Avoids thee of thy vows! Were it for thee, with her warm bosom near, To abide the sharpness of the Seraph's sphere? Forget thy foolish words; Go to her summons gay, Thy heart with dead, wing'd Innocencies fill'd, Ev'n as a nest with birds After the old ones by the hawk are kill'd. Well dost thou, Love, to celebrate The noon of thy soft ecstasy, Or e'er it be too late, Or e'er the Snowdrop die! II WIND AND WAVE The wedded light and heat, Winnowing the witless space, Without a let, What are they till they beat Against the sleepy sod, and there beget Perchance the violet! Is the One found, Amongst a wilderness of as happy grace, To make Heaven's bound; So that in Her All which it hath of sensitively good Is sought and understood After the narrow mode the mighty Heavens prefer? She, as a little breeze Following still Night, Ripples the spirit's cold, deep seas Into delight; But, in a while, The immeasurable smile Is broke by fresher airs to flashes blent With darkling discontent; And all the subtle zephyr hurries gay, And all the heaving ocean heaves one way, T'ward the void sky-line and an unguess'd weal; Until the vanward billows feel The agitating shallows, and divine the goal, And to foam roll, And spread and stray And traverse wildly, like delighted hands, The fair and fleckless sands; And so the whole Unfathomable and immense Triumphing tide comes at the last to reach And burst in wind-kiss'd splendours on the deaf'ning beach, Where forms of children in first innocence Laugh and fling pebbles on the rainbow'd crest Of its untired unrest. III WINTER I, singularly moved To love the lovely that are not beloved, Of all the Seasons, most Love Winter, and to trace The sense of the Trophonian pallor on her face. It is not death, but plenitude of peace; And the dim cloud that does the world enfold Hath less the characters of dark and cold Than warmth and light asleep, And correspondent breathing seems to keep With the infant harvest, breathing soft below Its eider coverlet of snow. Nor is in field or garden anything But, duly look'd into, contains serene The substance of things hoped for, in the Spring, And evidence of Summer not yet seen. On every chance-mild day That visits the moist shaw, The honeysuckle, 'sdaining to be crost In urgence of sweet life by sleet or frost, 'Voids the time's law With still increase Of leaflet new, and little, wandering spray; Often, in sheltering brakes, As one from rest disturb'd in the first hour, Primrose or violet bewilder'd wakes, And deems 'tis time to flower; Though not a whisper of her voice he hear, The buried bulb does know The signals of the year, And hails far Summer with his lifted spear. The gorse-field dark, by sudden, gold caprice, Turns, here and there, into a Jason's fleece; Lilies, that soon in Autumn slipp'd their gowns of green, And vanish'd into earth, And came again, ere Autumn died, to birth, Stand full-array'd, amidst the wavering shower, And perfect for the Summer, less the flower; In nook of pale or crevice of crude bark, Thou canst not miss, If close thou spy, to mark The ghostly chrysalis, That, if thou touch it, stirs in its dream dark; And the flush'd Robin, in the evenings hoar, Does of Love's Day, as if he saw it, sing; But sweeter yet than dream or song of Summer or Spring Are Winter's sometime smiles, that seem to well From infancy ineffable; Her wandering, languorous gaze, So unfamiliar, so without amaze, On the elemental, chill adversity, The uncomprehended rudeness; and her sigh And solemn, gathering tear, And look of exile from some great repose, the sphere Of ether, moved by ether only, or By something still more tranquil. IV BEATA Of infinite Heaven the rays, Piercing some eyelet in our cavern black, Ended their viewless track On thee to smite Solely, as on a diamond stalactite, And in mid-darkness lit a rainbow's blaze, Wherein the absolute Reason, Power, and Love, That erst could move Mainly in me but toil and weariness, Renounced their deadening might, Renounced their undistinguishable stress Of withering white, And did with gladdest hues my spirit caress, Nothing of Heaven in thee showing infinite, Save the delight. V THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW Perchance she droops within the hollow gulf Which the great wave of coming pleasure draws, Not guessing the glad cause! Ye Clouds that on your endless journey go, Ye Winds that westward flow, Thou heaving Sea That heav'st 'twixt her and me, Tell her I come; Then only sigh your pleasure, and be dumb; For the sweet secret of our either self We know. Tell her I come, And let her heart be still'd. One day's controlled hope, and then one more, And on the third our lives shall be fulfill'd! Yet all has been before: Palm placed in palm, twin smiles, and words astray. What other should we say? But shall I not, with ne'er a sign, perceive, Whilst her sweet hands I hold, The myriad threads and meshes manifold Which Love shall round her weave: The pulse in that vein making alien pause And varying beats from this; Down each long finger felt, a differing strand Of silvery welcome bland; And in her breezy palm And silken wrist, Beneath the touch of my like numerous bliss Complexly kiss'd, A diverse and distinguishable calm? What should we say! It all has been before; And yet our lives shall now be first fulfill'd, And into their summ'd sweetness fall distill'd One sweet drop more; One sweet drop more, in absolute increase Of unrelapsing peace. O, heaving Sea, That heav'st as if for bliss of her and me, And separatest not dear heart from heart, Though each 'gainst other beats too far apart, For yet awhile Let it not seem that I behold her smile. O, weary Love, O, folded to her breast, Love in each moment years and years of rest, Be calm, as being not. Ye oceans of intolerable delight, The blazing photosphere of central Night, Be ye forgot. Terror, thou swarthy Groom of Bride-bliss coy, Let me not see thee toy. O, Death, too tardy with thy hope intense Of kisses close beyond conceit of sense; O, Life, too liberal, while to take her hand Is more of hope than heart can understand; Perturb my golden patience not with joy, Nor, through a wish, profane The peace that should pertain To him who does by her attraction move. Has all not been before? One day's controlled hope, and one again, And then the third, and ye shall have the rein, O Life, Death, Terror, Love! But soon let your unrestful rapture cease, Ye flaming Ethers thin, Condensing till the abiding sweetness win One sweet drop more; One sweet drop more in the measureless increase Of honied peace. VI TRISTITIA Darling, with hearts conjoin'd in such a peace That Hope, so not to cease, Must still gaze back, And count, along our love's most happy track, The landmarks of like inconceiv'd increase, Promise me this: If thou alone should'st win God's perfect bliss, And I, beguiled by gracious-seeming sin, Say, loving too much thee, Love's last goal miss, And any vows may then have memory, Never, by grief for what I bear or lack, To mar thy joyance of heav'n's jubilee. Promise me this; For else I should be hurl'd, Beyond just doom And by thy deed, to Death's interior gloom, From the mild borders of the banish'd world Wherein they dwell Who builded not unalterable fate On pride, fraud, envy, cruel lust, or hate; Yet loved too laxly sweetness and heart's ease, And strove the creature more than God to please. For such as these Loss without measure, sadness without end! Yet not for this do thou disheaven'd be With thinking upon me. Though black, when scann'd from heaven's surpassing bright, This might mean light, Foil'd with the dim days of mortality. For God is everywhere. Go down to deepest Hell, and He is there, And, as a true but quite estranged Friend, He works, 'gainst gnashing teeth of devilish ire, With love deep hidden lest it be blasphemed, If possible, to blend Ease with the pangs of its inveterate fire; Yea, in the worst And from His Face most wilfully accurst Of souls in vain redeem'd, He does with potions of oblivion kill Remorse of the lost Love that helps them still. Apart from these, Near the sky-borders of that banish'd world, Wander pale spirits among willow'd leas, Lost beyond measure, sadden'd without end, But since, while erring most, retaining yet Some ineffectual fervour of regret, Retaining still such weal As spurned Lovers feel, Preferring far to all the world's delight Their loss so infinite, Or Poets, when they mark In the clouds dun A loitering flush of the long sunken sun, And turn away with tears into the dark. Know, Dear, these are not mine But Wisdom's words, confirmed by divine Doctors and Saints, though fitly seldom heard Save in their own prepense-occulted word, Lest fools be fool'd the further by false hope, And wrest sweet knowledge to their own decline; And (to approve I speak within my scope) The Mistress of that dateless exile gray Is named in surpliced Schools Tristitia. But, O, my Darling, look in thy heart and see How unto me, Secured of my prime care, thy happy state, In the most unclean cell Of sordid Hell, And worried by the most ingenious hate, It never could be anything but well, Nor from my soul, full of thy sanctity, Such pleasure die As the poor harlot's, in whose body stirs The innocent life that is and is not hers: Unless, alas, this fount of my relief By thy unheavenly grief Were closed. So, with a consecrating kiss And hearts made one in past all previous peace, And on one hope reposed, Promise me this! VII THE AZALEA There, where the sun shines first Against our room, She train'd the gold Azalea, whose perfume She, Spring-like, from her breathing grace dispersed. Last night the delicate crests of saffron bloom, For this their dainty likeness watch'd and nurst, Were just at point to burst. At dawn I dream'd, O God, that she was dead, And groan'd aloud upon my wretched bed, And waked, ah, God, and did not waken her, But lay, with eyes still closed, Perfectly bless'd in the delicious sphere By which I knew so well that she was near, My heart to speechless thankfulness composed. Till 'gan to stir A dizzy somewhat in my troubled head— It was the azalea's breath, and she was dead! The warm night had the lingering buds disclosed, And I had fall'n asleep with to my breast A chance-found letter press'd In which she said, ‘So, till to-morrow eve, my Own, adieu! Parting's well-paid with soon again to meet, Soon in your arms to feel so small and sweet, Sweet to myself that am so sweet to you!’ VIII DEPARTURE It was not like your great and gracious ways! Do you, that have nought other to lament, Never, my Love, repent Of how, that July afternoon, You went, With sudden, unintelligible phrase, And frighten'd eye, Upon your journey of so many days, Without a single kiss, or a good-bye? I knew, indeed, that you were parting soon; And so we sate, within the low sun's rays, You whispering to me, for your voice was weak, Your harrowing praise. Well, it was well, To hear you such things speak, And I could tell What made your eyes a growing gloom of love, As a warm South-wind sombres a March grove. And it was like your great and gracious ways To turn your talk on daily things, my Dear, Lifting the luminous, pathetic lash To let the laughter flash, Whilst I drew near, Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear. But all at once to leave me at the last, More at the wonder than the loss aghast, With huddled, unintelligible phrase, And frighten'd eye, And go your journey of all days With not one kiss, or a good-bye, And the only loveless look the look with which you pass'd: 'Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways. IX EURYDICE Is this the portent of the day nigh past, And of a restless grave O'er which the eternal sadness gathers fast; Or but the heaped wave Of some chance, wandering tide, Such as that world of awe Whose circuit, listening to a foreign law, Conjunctures ours at unguess'd dates and wide, Does in the Spirit's tremulous ocean draw, To pass unfateful on, and so subside? Thee, whom ev'n more than Heaven loved I have, And yet have not been true Even to thee, I, dreaming, night by night, seek now to see, And, in a mortal sorrow, still pursue Thro' sordid streets and lanes And houses brown and bare And many a haggard stair Ochrous with ancient stains, And infamous doors, opening on hapless rooms, In whose unhaunted glooms Dead pauper generations, witless of the sun, Their course have run; And ofttimes my pursuit Is check'd of its dear fruit By things brimful of hate, my kith and kin, Furious that I should keep Their forfeit power to weep, And mock, with living fear, their mournful malice thin. But ever, at the last, my way I win To where, with perfectly sad patience, nurst By sorry comfort of assured worst, Ingrain'd in fretted cheek and lips that pine, On pallet poor Thou lyest, stricken sick, Beyond love's cure, By all the world's neglect, but chiefly mine. Then sweetness, sweeter than my tongue can tell, Does in my bosom well, And tears come free and quick And more and more abound For piteous passion keen at having found, After exceeding ill, a little good; A little good Which, for the while, Fleets with the current sorrow of the blood, Though no good here has heart enough to smile. X THE TOYS My little Son, who look'd from thoughtful eyes And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise, Having my law the seventh time disobey'd, I struck him, and dismiss'd With hard words and unkiss'd, His Mother, who was patient, being dead. Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep, I visited his bed, But found him slumbering deep, With darken'd eyelids, and their lashes yet From his late sobbing wet. And I, with moan, Kissing away his tears, left others of my own; For, on a table drawn beside his head, He had put, within his reach, A box of counters and a red-vein'd stone, A piece of glass abraded by the beach And six or seven shells, A bottle with bluebells And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art, To comfort his sad heart. So when that night I pray'd To God, I wept, and said: Ah, when at last we lie with tranced breath, Not vexing Thee in death, And Thou rememberest of what toys We made our joys, How weakly understood, Thy great commanded good, Then, fatherly not less Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay, Thou'lt leave Thy wrath, and say, ‘I will be sorry for their childishness.’ XI TIRED MEMORY The stony rock of death's insensibility Well'd yet awhile with honey of thy love And then was dry; Nor could thy picture, nor thine empty glove, Nor all thy kind, long letters, nor the band Which really spann'd Thy body chaste and warm, Thenceforward move Upon the stony rock their wearied charm. At last, then, thou wast dead. Yet would I not despair, But wrought my daily task, and daily said Many and many a fond, unfeeling prayer, To keep my vows of faith to thee from harm. In vain. ‘For 'tis,’ I said, ‘all one, The wilful faith, which has no joy or pain, As if 'twere none.’ Then look'd I miserably round If aught of duteous love were left undone, And nothing found. But, kneeling in a Church, one Easter-Day, It came to me to say: ‘Though there is no intelligible rest, In Earth or Heaven, For me, but on her breast, I yield her up, again to have her given, Or not, as, Lord, Thou wilt, and that for aye.’ And the same night, in slumber lying, I, who had dream'd of thee as sad and sick and dying, And only so, nightly for all one year, Did thee, my own most Dear, Possess, In gay, celestial beauty nothing coy, And felt thy soft caress With heretofore unknown reality of joy. But, in our mortal air, None thrives for long upon the happiest dream, And fresh despair Bade me seek round afresh for some extreme Of unconceiv'd, interior sacrifice Whereof the smoke might rise To God, and 'mind Him that one pray'd below. And so, In agony, I cried: ‘My Lord, if Thy strange will be this, That I should crucify my heart, Because my love has also been my pride, I do submit, if I saw how, to bliss Wherein She has no part.’ And I was heard, And taken at my own remorseless word. O, my most Dear, Was't treason, as I fear? 'Twere that, and worse, to plead thy veiled mind, Kissing thy babes, and murmuring in mine ear, ‘Thou canst not be Faithful to God, and faithless unto me!’ Ah, prophet kind! I heard, all dumb and blind With tears of protest; and I cannot see But faith was broken. Yet, as I have said, My heart was dead, Dead of devotion and tired memory, When a strange grace of thee In a fair stranger, as I take it, bred To her some tender heed, Most innocent Of purpose therewith blent, And pure of faith, I think, to thee; yet such That the pale reflex of an alien love, So vaguely, sadly shown, Did her heart touch Above All that, till then, had woo'd her for its own. And so the fear, which is love's chilly dawn, Flush'd faintly upon lids that droop'd like thine, And made me weak, By thy delusive likeness doubly drawn, And Nature's long suspended breath of flame Persuading soft, and whispering Duty's name, Awhile to smile and speak With this thy Sister sweet, and therefore mine; Thy Sister sweet, Who bade the wheels to stir Of sensitive delight in the poor brain, Dead of devotion and tired memory, So that I lived again, And, strange to aver, With no relapse into the void inane, For thee; But (treason was't?) for thee and also her. XII MAGNA EST VERITAS Here, in this little Bay, Full of tumultuous life and great repose, Where, twice a day, The purposeless, glad ocean comes and goes, Under high cliffs, and far from the huge town, I sit me down. For want of me the world's course will not fail: When all its work is done, the lie shall rot; The truth is great, and shall prevail, When none cares whether it prevail or not. XIII 1867 In this year the middle and upper classes were disfranchised by Mr. Disraeli's Government, and the final destruction of the liberties of England by the Act of 1884 rendered inevitable. In the year of the great crime, When the false English Nobles and their Jew, By God demented, slew The Trust they stood twice pledged to keep from wrong, One said, Take up thy Song, That breathes the mild and almost mythic time Of England's prime! But I, Ah, me, The freedom of the few That, in our free Land, were indeed the free, Can song renew? Ill singing 'tis with blotting prison-bars, How high soe'er, betwixt us and the stars; Ill singing 'tis when there are none to hear; And days are near When England shall forget The fading glow which, for a little while, Illumes her yet, The lovely smile That grows so faint and wan, Her people shouting in her dying ear, Are not two daws worth two of any swan! Ye outlaw'd Best, who yet are bright With the sunken light, Whose common style Is Virtue at her gracious ease, The flower of olden sanctities, Ye haply trust, by love's benignant guile, To lure the dark and selfish brood To their own hated good; Ye haply dream Your lives shall still their charmful sway sustain, Unstifled by the fever'd steam That rises from the plain. Know, 'twas the force of function high, In corporate exercise, and public awe Of Nature's, Heaven's, and England's Law That Best, though mix'd with Bad, should reign, Which kept you in your sky! But, when the sordid Trader caught The loose-held sceptre from your hands distraught, And soon, to the Mechanic vain, Sold the proud toy for nought, Your charm was broke, your task was sped, Your beauty, with your honour, dead, And though you still are dreaming sweet Of being even now not less Than Gods and Goddesses, ye shall not long so cheat Your hearts of their due heaviness. Go, get you for your evil watching shriven! Leave to your lawful Master's itching hands Your unking'd lands, But keep, at least, the dignity Of deigning not, for his smooth use, to be, Voteless, the voted delegates Of his strange interests, loves and hates. In sackcloth, or in private strife With private ill, ye may please Heaven, And soothe the coming pangs of sinking life; And prayer perchance may win A term to God's indignant mood And the orgies of the multitude, Which now begin; But do not hope to wave the silken rag Of your unsanction'd flag, And so to guide The great ship, helmless on the swelling tide Of that presumptuous Sea, Unlit by sun or moon, yet inly bright With lights innumerable that give no light, Flames of corrupted will and scorn of right, Rejoicing to be free. And, now, because the dark comes on apace When none can work for fear, And Liberty in every Land lies slain, And the two Tyrannies unchallenged reign, And heavy prophecies, suspended long At supplication of the righteous few, And so discredited, to fulfilment throng, Restrain'd no more by faithful prayer or tear, And the dread baptism of blood seems near That brings to the humbled Earth the Time of Grace, Breathless be song, And let Christ's own look through The darkness, suddenly increased, To the gray secret lingering in the East. XIV ‘IF I WERE DEAD’ ‘If I were dead, you'd sometimes say, Poor Child!’ The dear lips quiver'd as they spake, And the tears brake From eyes which, not to grieve me, brightly smiled. Poor Child, poor Child! I seem to hear your laugh, your talk, your song. It is not true that Love will do no wrong. Poor Child! And did you think, when you so cried and smiled, How I, in lonely nights, should lie awake, And of those words your full avengers make? Poor Child, poor Child! And now, unless it be That sweet amends thrice told are come to thee, O God, have Thou no mercy upon me! Poor Child! XV PEACE O England, how hast thou forgot, In dullard care for undisturb'd increase Of gold, which profits not, The gain which once thou knew'st was for thy peace! Honour is peace, the peace which does accord Alone with God's glad word: ‘My peace I send you, and I send a sword.’ O England, how hast thou forgot, How fear'st the things which make for joy, not fear, Confronted near. Hard days? 'Tis what the pamper'd seek to buy With their most willing gold in weary lands. Loss and pain risk'd? What sport but understands These for incitements! Suddenly to die, With conscience a blurr'd scroll? The sunshine dreaming upon Salmon's height Is not so sweet and white As the most heretofore sin-spotted soul That darts to its delight Straight from the absolution of a faithful fight. Myriads of homes unloosen'd of home's bond, And fill'd with helpless babes and harmless women fond? Let those whose pleasant chance Took them, like me, among the German towns, After the war that pluck'd the fangs from France, With me pronounce Whether the frequent black, which then array'd Child, wife, and maid, Did most to magnify the sombreness of grief, Or add the beauty of a staid relief And freshening foil To cheerful-hearted Honour's ready smile! Beneath the heroic sun Is there then none Whose sinewy wings by choice do fly In the fine mountain-air of public obloquy, To tell the sleepy mongers of false ease That war's the ordained way of all alive, And therein with goodwill to dare and thrive Is profit and heart's peace? But in his heart the fool now saith: ‘The thoughts of Heaven were past all finding out, Indeed, if it should rain Intolerable woes upon our Land again, After so long a drought!’ ‘Will a kind Providence our vessel whelm, With such a pious Pilot at the helm?’ ‘Or let the throats be cut of pretty sheep That care for nought but pasture rich and deep?’ ‘Were 't Evangelical of God to deal so foul a blow At people who hate Turks and Papists so?’ ‘What, make or keep A tax for ship and gun, When 'tis full three to one Yon bully but intends To beat our friends?’ ‘Let's put aside Our costly pride. Our appetite's not gone Because we've learn'd to doff Our caps, where we were used to keep them on.’ ‘If times get worse, We've money in our purse, And Patriots that know how, let who will scoff, To buy our perils off. Yea, blessed in our midst Art thou who lately didst, So cheap, The old bargain of the Saxon with the Dane.’ The Alabama Treaty. Thus in his heart the fool now saith; And, lo, our trusted leaders trust fool's luck, Which, like the whale's 'mazed chine, When they thereon were mulling of their wine, Will some day duck. Remnant of Honour, brooding in the dark Over your bitter cark, Staring, as Rispah stared, astonied seven days, Upon the corpses of so many sons, Who loved her once, Dead in the dim and lion-haunted ways, Who could have dreamt That times should come like these! Prophets, indeed, taught lies when we were young, And people loved to have it so; For they teach well who teach their scholars' tongue! But that the foolish both should gaze, With feeble, fascinated face, Upon the wan crest of the coming woe, The billow of earthquake underneath the seas, And sit at ease, Or stand agape, Without so much as stepping back to 'scape, Mumbling, ‘Perchance we perish if we stay: 'Tis certain wear of shoes to stir away!’ Who could have dreamt That times should come like these! Remnant of Honour, tongue-tied with contempt, Consider; you are strong yet, if you please. A hundred just men up, and arm'd but with a frown, May hoot a hundred thousand false loons down, Or drive them any way like geese. But to sit silent now is to suborn The common villainy you scorn. In the dark hour When phrases are in power, And nought's to choose between The thing which is not and which is not seen, One fool, with lusty lungs, Does what a hundred wise, who hate and hold their tongues, Shall ne'er undo. In such an hour, When eager hands are fetter'd and too few, And hearts alone have leave to bleed, Speak; for a good word then is a good deed. XVI A FAREWELL With all my will, but much against my heart, We two now part. My Very Dear, Our solace is, the sad road lies so clear. It needs no art, With faint, averted feet And many a tear, In our opposed paths to persevere. Go thou to East, I West. We will not say There's any hope, it is so far away. But, O, my Best, When the one darling of our widowhead, The nursling Grief, Is dead, And no dews blur our eyes To see the peach-bloom come in evening skies, Perchance we may, Where now this night is day, And even through faith of still averted feet, Making full circle of our banishment, Amazed meet; The bitter journey to the bourne so sweet Seasoning the termless feast of our content With tears of recognition never dry. XVII 1880–85 Stand by, Ye Wise, by whom Heav'n rules! Your kingly hands suit not the hangman's tools. When God has doom'd a glorious Past to die, Are there no knaves and fools? For ages yet to come your kind shall count for nought. Smoke of the strife of other Powers Than ours, And tongues inscrutable with fury fraught 'Wilder the sky, Till the far good which none can guess be wrought. Stand by! Since tears are vain, here let us rest and laugh, But not too loudly; for the brave time's come, When Best may not blaspheme the Bigger Half, And freedom for our sort means freedom to be dumb. Lo, how the dross and draff Jeer up at us, and shout, ‘The Day is ours, the Night is theirs!’ And urge their rout Where the wild dawn of rising Tartarus flares. Yon strives their Leader, lusting to be seen. His leprosy's so perfect that men call him clean! Listen the long, sincere, and liberal bray Of the earnest Puller at another's hay 'Gainst aught that dares to tug the other way, Quite void of fears With all that noise of ruin round his ears! Yonder the people cast their caps o'erhead, And swear the threaten'd doom is ne'er to dread That's come, though not yet past. All front the horror and are none aghast; Brag of their full-blown rights and liberties, Nor once surmise When each man gets his due the Nation dies; Nay, still shout ‘Progress!’ as if seven plagues Should take the laggard who would stretch his legs. Forward! glad rush of Gergesenian swine; You've gain'd the hill-top, but there's yet the brine. Forward! to meet the welcome of the waves That mount to 'whelm the freedom which enslaves. Forward! bad corpses turn into good dung, To feed strange futures beautiful and young. Forward! God speed ye down the damn'd decline, And grant ye the Fool's true good, in abject ruin's gulf As the Wise see him so to see himself! Ah, Land once mine, That seem'd to me too sweetly wise, Too sternly fair for aught that dies, Past is thy proud and pleasant state, That recent date When, strong and single, in thy sovereign heart, The thrones of thinking, hearing, sight, The cunning hand, the knotted thew Of lesser powers that heave and hew, And each the smallest beneficial part, And merest pore of breathing, beat, Full and complete, The great pulse of thy generous might, Equal in inequality, That soul of joy in low and high; When not a churl but felt the Giant's heat, Albeit he simply call'd it his, Flush in his common labour with delight, And not a village-Maiden's kiss But was for this More sweet, And not a sorrow but did lightlier sigh, And for its private self less greet, The whilst that other so majestic self stood by! Integrity so vast could well afford To wear in working many a stain, To pillory the cobbler vain And license madness in a lord. On that were all men well agreed; And, if they did a thing, Their strength was with them in their deed, And from amongst them came the shout of a king! But, once let traitor coward meet, Not Heaven itself can keep its feet. Come knave who said to dastard, ‘Lo, ‘The Deluge!’ which but needed ‘No!’ For all the Atlantic's threatening roar, If men would bravely understand, Is softly check'd for evermore By a firm bar of sand. But, dastard listening knave, who said, ‘'Twere juster were the Giant dead, That so yon bawlers may not miss To vote their own pot-belly'd bliss,’ All that is past! We saw the slaying, and were not aghast. But ne'er a sun, on village Groom and Bride, Albeit they guess not how it is, At Easter or at Whitsuntide, But shines less gay for this! XVIII THE TWO DESERTS Not greatly moved with awe am I To learn that we may spy Five thousand firmaments beyond our own. The best that's known Of the heavenly bodies does them credit small. View'd close, the Moon's fair ball Is of ill objects worst, A corpse in Night's highway, naked, fire-scarr'd, accurst; And now they tell That the Sun is plainly seen to boil and burst Too horribly for hell. So, judging from these two, As we must do, The Universe, outside our living Earth, Was all conceiv'd in the Creator's mirth, Forecasting at the time Man's spirit deep, To make dirt cheap. Put by the Telescope! Better without it man may see, Stretch'd awful in the hush'd midnight, The ghost of his eternity. Give me the nobler glass that swells to the eye The things which near us lie, Till Science rapturously hails, In the minutest water-drop, A torment of innumerable tails. These at the least do live. But rather give A mind not much to pry Beyond our royal-fair estate Betwixt these deserts blank of small and great. Wonder and beauty our own courtiers are, Pressing to catch our gaze, And out of obvious ways Ne'er wandering far. XIX CREST AND GULF Much woe that man befalls Who does not run when sent, nor come when Heaven calls; But whether he serve God, or his own whim, Not matters, in the end, to any one but him; And he as soon Shall map the other side of the Moon, As trace what his own deed, In the next chop of the chance gale, shall breed. This he may know: His good or evil seed Is like to grow, For its first harvest, quite to contraries: The father wise Has still the hare-brain'd brood; 'Gainst evil, ill example better works than good; The poet, fanning his mild flight At a most keen and arduous height, Unveils the tender heavens to horny human eyes Amidst ingenious blasphemies. Wouldst raise the poor, in Capuan luxury sunk? The Nation lives but whilst its Lords are drunk! Or spread Heav'n's partial gifts o'er all, like dew? The Many's weedy growth withers the gracious Few! Strange opposites, from those, again, shall rise. Join, then, if thee it please, the bitter jest Of mankind's progress; all its spectral race Mere impotence of rest, The heaving vain of life which cannot cease from self, Crest altering still to gulf And gulf to crest In endless chace, That leaves the tossing water anchor'd in its place! Ah, well does he who does but stand aside, Sans hope or fear, And marks the crest and gulf in station sink and rear, And prophesies 'gainst trust in such a tide: For he sometimes is prophet, heavenly taught, Whose message is that he sees only nought. Nathless, discern'd may be, By listeners at the doors of destiny, The fly-wheel swift and still Of God's incessant will, Mighty to keep in bound, tho' powerless to quell, The amorous and vehement drift of man's herd to hell. XX ‘LET BE!’ Ah, yes; we tell the good and evil trees By fruits: But how tell these? Who does not know That good and ill Are done in secret still, And that which shews is verily but show! How high of heart is one, and one how sweet of mood: But not all height is holiness, Nor every sweetness good; And grace will sometimes lurk where who could guess? The Critic of his kind, Dealing to each his share, With easy humour, hard to bear, May not impossibly have in him shrined, As in a gossamer globe or thickly padded pod, Some small seed dear to God. Haply yon wretch, so famous for his falls, Got them beneath the Devil-defended walls Of some high Virtue he had vow'd to win; And that which you and I Call his besetting sin Is but the fume of his peculiar fire Of inmost contrary desire, And means wild willingness for her to die, Dash'd with despondence of her favour sweet; He fiercer fighting, in his worst defeat, Than I or you, That only courteous greet Where he does hotly woo, Did ever fight, in our best victory. Another is mistook Through his deceitful likeness to his look! Let be, let be: Why should I clear myself, why answer thou for me? That shaft of slander shot Miss'd only the right blot. I see the shame They cannot see: 'Tis very just they blame The thing that's not. XXI ‘FAINT YET PURSUING’ Heroic Good, target for which the young Dream in their dreams that every bow is strung, And, missing, sigh Unfruitful, or as disbelievers die, Thee having miss'd, I will not so revolt, But lowlier shoot my bolt, And lowlier still, if still I may not reach, And my proud stomach teach That less than highest is good, and may be high. An even walk in life's uneven way, Though to have dreamt of flight and not to fly Be strange and sad, Is not a boon that's given to all who pray. If this I had I'd envy none! Nay, trod I straight for one Year, month or week, Should Heaven withdraw, and Satan me amerce Of power and joy, still would I seek Another victory with a like reverse; Because the good of victory does not die, As dies the failure's curse, And what we have to gain Is, not one battle, but a weary life's campaign. Yet meaner lot being sent Should more than me content; Yea, if I lie Among vile shards, though born for silver wings, In the strong flight and feathers gold Of whatsoever heavenward mounts and sings I must by admiration so comply That there I should my own delight behold. Yea, though I sin each day times seven, And dare not lift the fearfullest eyes to Heaven, Thanks must I give Because that seven times are not eight or nine, And that my darkness is all mine, And that I live Within this oak-shade one more minute even, Hearing the winds their Maker magnify. XXII VICTORY IN DEFEAT Ah, God, alas, How soon it came to pass The sweetness melted from thy barbed hook Which I so simply took; And I lay bleeding on the bitter land, Afraid to stir against thy least command, But losing all my pleasant life-blood, whence Force should have been heart's frailty to withstand. Life is not life at all without delight, Nor has it any might; And better than the insentient heart and brain Is sharpest pain; And better for the moment seems it to rebel, If the great Master, from his lifted seat, Ne'er whispers to the wearied servant ‘Well!’ Yet what returns of love did I endure, When to be pardon'd seem'd almost more sweet Than aye to have been pure! But day still faded to disastrous night, And thicker darkness changed to feebler light, Until forgiveness, without stint renew'd, Was now no more with loving tears imbued, Vowing no more offence. Not less to thine Unfaithful didst thou cry, ‘Come back, poor Child; be all as 'twas before. But I, ‘No, no; I will not promise any more! Yet, when I feel my hour is come to die, And so I am secured of continence, Then may I say, though haply then in vain, “My only, only Love, O, take me back again!”’ Thereafter didst thou smite So hard that, for a space, Uplifted seem'd Heav'n's everlasting door, And I indeed the darling of thy grace. But, in some dozen changes of the moon, A bitter mockery seem'd thy bitter boon. The broken pinion was no longer sore. Again, indeed, I woke Under so dread a stroke That all the strength it left within my heart Was just to ache and turn, and then to turn and ache, And some weak sign of war unceasingly to make. And here I lie, With no one near to mark, Thrusting Hell's phantoms feebly in the dark, And still at point more utterly to die. O God, how long! Put forth indeed thy powerful right hand, While time is yet, Or never shall I see the blissful land! Thus I: then God, in pleasant speech and strong, (Which soon I shall forget): ‘The man who, though his fights be all defeats, Still fights, Enters at last The heavenly Jerusalem's rejoicing streets With glory more, and more triumphant rites Than always-conquering Joshua's, when his blast The frighted walls of Jericho down cast; And, lo, the glad surprise Of peace beyond surmise, More than in common Saints, for ever in his eyes. XXIII REMEMBERED GRACE Since succour to the feeblest of the wise Is charge of nobler weight Than the security Of many and many a foolish soul's estate, This I affirm, Though fools will fools more confidently be: Whom God does once with heart to heart befriend, He does so till the end: And having planted life's miraculous germ, One sweet pulsation of responsive love, He sets him sheer above, Not sin and bitter shame And wreck of fame, But Hell's insidious and more black attempt, The envy, malice, and pride, Which men who share so easily condone That few ev'n list such ills as these to hide. From these unalterably exempt, Through the remember'd grace Of that divine embrace, Of his sad errors none, Though gross to blame, Shall cast him lower than the cleansing flame, Nor make him quite depart From the small flock named ‘after God's own heart,’ And to themselves unknown. Nor can he quail In faith, nor flush nor pale When all the other idiot people spell How this or that new Prophet's word belies Their last high oracle; But constantly his soul Points to its pole Ev'n as the needle points, and knows not why; And, under the ever-changing clouds of doubt, When others cry, ‘The stars, if stars there were, Are quench'd and out!’ To him, uplooking t'ward the hills for aid, Appear, at need display'd, Gaps in the low-hung gloom, and, bright in air, Orion or the Bear. XXIV VESICA PISCIS In strenuous hope I wrought, And hope seem'd still betray'd; Lastly I said, ‘I have labour'd through the Night, nor yet Have taken aught; But at Thy word I will again cast forth the net!’ And, lo, I caught (Oh, quite unlike and quite beyond my thought,) Not the quick, shining harvest of the Sea, For food, my wish, But Thee! Then, hiding even in me, As hid was Simon's coin within the fish, Thou sigh'd'st, with joy, ‘Be dumb, Or speak but of forgotten things to far-off times to come.’ BOOK II I TO THE UNKNOWN EROS What rumour'd heavens are these Which not a poet sings, O, Unknown Eros? What this breeze Of sudden wings Speeding at far returns of time from interstellar space To fan my very face, And gone as fleet, Through delicatest ether feathering soft their solitary beat, With ne'er a light plume dropp'd, nor any trace To speak of whence they came, or whither they depart? And why this palpitating heart, This blind and unrelated joy, This meaningless desire, That moves me like the Child Who in the flushing darkness troubled lies, Inventing lonely prophecies, Which even to his Mother mild He dares not tell; To which himself is infidel; His heart not less on fire With dreams impossible as wildest Arab Tale, (So thinks the boy,) With dreams that turn him red and pale, Yet less impossible and wild Than those which bashful Love, in his own way and hour, Shall duly bring to flower? O, Unknown Eros, sire of awful bliss, What portent and what Delphic word, Such as in form of snake forebodes the bird, Is this? In me life's even flood What eddies thus? What in its ruddy orbit lifts the blood, Like a perturbed moon of Uranus, Reaching to some great world in ungauged darkness hid; And whence This rapture of the sense Which, by thy whisper bid, Reveres with obscure rite and sacramental sign A bond I know not of nor dimly can divine; This subject loyalty which longs For chains and thongs Woven of gossamer and adamant, To bind me to my unguess'd want, And so to lie, Between those quivering plumes that thro' fine ether pant, For hopeless, sweet eternity? What God unhonour'd hitherto in songs, Or which, that now Forgettest the disguise That Gods must wear who visit human eyes, Art Thou? Thou art not Amor; or, if so, yon pyre, That waits the willing victim, flames with vestal fire; Nor mooned Queen of maids; or, if thou'rt she, Ah, then, from Thee Let Bride and Bridegroom learn what kisses be! In what veil'd hymn Or mystic dance Would he that were thy Priest advance Thine earthly praise, thy glory limn? Say, should the feet that feel thy thought In double-center'd circuit run, In that compulsive focus, Nought, In this a furnace like the sun; And might some note of thy renown And high behest Thus in enigma be expressed: ‘There lies the crown Which all thy longing cures. Refuse it, Mortal, that it may be yours! It is a Spirit, though it seems red gold; And such may no man, but by shunning, hold. Refuse it, till refusing be despair; And thou shalt feel the phantom in thy hair.’ II THE CONTRACT Twice thirty centuries and more ago, All in a heavenly Abyssinian vale, Man first met woman; and the ruddy snow On many-ridgëd Abora turn'd pale, And the song choked within the nightingale. A mild white furnace in the thorough blast Of purest spirit seem'd She as she pass'd; And of the Man enough that this be said, He look'd her Head. Towards their bower Together as they went, With hearts conceiving torrents of content, And linger'd prologue fit for Paradise, He, gathering power From dear persuasion of the dim-lit hour, And doubted sanction of her sparkling eyes, Thus supplicates her conjugal assent, And thus she makes replies: ‘Lo, Eve, the Day burns on the snowy height, But here is mellow night!’ ‘Here let us rest. The languor of the light Is in my feet. It is thy strength, my Love, that makes me weak; Thy strength it is that makes my weakness sweet. What would thy kiss'd lips speak?’ ‘See, what a world of roses I have spread To make the bridal bed. Come, Beauty's self and Love's, thus to thy throne be led!’ ‘My Lord, my Wisdom, nay! Does not yon love-delighted Planet run, (Haply against her heart,) A space apart For ever from her strong-persuading Sun! O say, Shall we no voluntary bars Set to our drift? I, Sister of the Stars, And Thou, my glorious, course-compelling Day!’ ‘Yea, yea! Was it an echo of her coming word Which, ere she spake, I heard? Or through what strange distrust was I, her Head, Not first this thing to have said? Alway Speaks not within my breast The uncompulsive, great and sweet behest Of something bright, Not named, not known, and yet more manifest Than is the morn, The sun being just at point then to be born? O Eve, take back thy “Nay.” Trust me, Beloved, ever in all to mean Thy blissful service, sacrificial, keen; But bondless be that service, and let speak—’ ‘This other world of roses in my cheek, Which hide them in thy breast, and deepening seek That thou decree if they mean Yea or Nay.’ ‘Did e'er so sweet a word such sweet gainsay!’ ‘And when I lean, Love, on you, thus, and smile So that my Nay seems Yea, You must the while Thence be confirm'd that I deny you still.’ ‘I will, I will!’ ‘And when my arms are round your neck, like this, And I, as now, Melt like a golden ingot in your kiss, Then, more than ever, shall your splendid word Be as Archangel Michael's severing sword! Speak, speak! Your might, Love, makes me weak, Your might it is that makes my weakness sweet.’ ‘I vow, I vow!’ ‘And are you happy, O, my Hero and Lord; And is your joy complete?’ ‘Yea, with my joyful heart my body rocks, And joy comes down from Heaven in floods and shocks, As from Mount Abora comes the avalanche.’ ‘My Law, my Light! Then am I yours as your high mind may list. No wile shall lure you, none can I resist!’ Thus the first Eve With much enamour'd Adam did enact Their mutual free contract Of virgin spousals, blissful beyond flight Of modern thought, with great intention staunch, Though unobliged until that binding pact. Whether She kept her word, or He the mind To hold her, wavering, to his own restraint, Answer, ye pleasures faint, Ye fiery throes, and upturn'd eyeballs blind Of sick-at-heart Mankind, Whom nothing succour can, Until a heaven-caress'd and happier Eve Be join'd with some glad Saint In like espousals, blessed upon Earth, And she her Fruit forth bring; No numb, chill-hearted, shaken-witted thing, 'Plaining his little span, But of proud virgin joy the appropriate birth, The Son of God and Man. III ARBOR VITÆ With honeysuckle, over-sweet, festoon'd; With bitter ivy bound; Terraced with funguses unsound; Deform'd with many a boss And closed scar, o'ercushion'd deep with moss; Bunch'd all about with pagan mistletoe; And thick with nests of the hoarse bird That talks, but understands not his own word; Stands, and so stood a thousand years ago, A single tree. Thunder has done its worst among its twigs, Where the great crest yet blackens, never pruned, But in its heart, alway Ready to push new verdurous boughs, whene'er The rotting saplings near it fall and leave it air, Is all antiquity and no decay. Rich, though rejected by the forest-pigs, Its fruit, beneath whose rough, concealing rind They that will break it find Heart-succouring savour of each several meat, And kernell'd drink of brain-renewing power, With bitter condiment and sour, And sweet economy of sweet, And odours that remind Of haunts of childhood and a different day. Beside this tree, Praising no Gods nor blaming, sans a wish, Sits, Tartar-like, the Time's civility, And eats its dead-dog off a golden dish. IV THE STANDARDS That last, Blown from our Sion of the Seven Hills, Was no uncertain blast! Listen: the warning all the champaign fills, And minatory murmurs, answering, mar The Night, both near and far, Perplexing many a drowsy citadel Beneath whose ill-watch'd walls the Powers of Hell, With armed jar And angry threat, surcease Their long-kept compact of contemptuous peace! Lo, yonder, where our little English band, With peace in heart and wrath in hand, Have dimly ta'en their stand, Sweetly the light Shines from the solitary peak at Edgbaston, Whence, o'er the dawning Land, Gleam the gold blazonries of Love irate 'Gainst the black flag of Hate. This Piece was written in the year 1874, soon after the publication of an incendiary pamphlet by Mr. Gladstone against the English Catholics, occasioned by the Vatican Council. Envy not, little band, Your brothers under the Hohenzollern hoof Put to the splendid proof. Your hour is near! The spectre-haunted time of idle Night, Your only fear, Thank God, is done, And Day and War, Man's work-time and delight, Begun. Ho, ye of the van there, veterans great of cheer, Look to your footing, when, from yonder verge, The wish'd Sun shall emerge; Lest once again the Flower of Sharon bloom After a way the Stalk call heresy. Strange splendour and strange gloom Alike confuse the path Of customary faith; And when the dim-seen mountains turn to flame And every roadside atom is a spark, The dazzled sense, that used was to the dark, May well doubt, ‘Is't the safe way and the same By which we came From Egypt, and to Canaan mean to go?’ But know, The clearness then so marvellously increas'd, The light'ning shining Westward from the East, Is the great promised sign Of His victorious and divine Approach, whose coming in the clouds shall be, As erst was His humility, A stumbling unto some, the first bid to the Feast. Cry, Ho! Good speed to them that come and them that go From either gathering host, And, after feeble, false allegiance, now first know Their post. Ho, ye Who loved our Flag Only because there flapp'd none other rag Which gentlemen might doff to, and such be, 'Save your gentility! For leagued, alas, are we With many a faithful rogue Discrediting bright Truth with dirt and brogue; And flatterers, too, That still would sniff the grass After the 'broider'd shoe, And swear it smelt like musk where He did pass, Though he were Borgia or Caiaphas. Ho, ye Who dread the bondage of the boundless fields Which Heaven's allegiance yields, And, like to house-hatch'd finches, hop not free Unless 'tween walls of wire, Look, there be many cages: choose to your desire! Ho, ye, Of God the least beloved, of Man the most, That like not leaguing with the lesser host, Behold the invested Mount, And that assaulting Sea with ne'er a coast. You need not stop to count! But come up, ye Who adore, in any way, Our God by His wide-honour'd Name of Yea. Come up; for where ye stand ye cannot stay. Come all That either mood of heavenly joyance know, And, on the ladder hierarchical, Have seen the order'd Angels to and fro Descending with the pride of service sweet, Ascending, with the rapture of receipt! Come who have felt, in soul and heart and sense, The entire obedience Which opes the bosom, like a blissful wife, To the Husband of all life! Come ye that find contentment's very core In the light store And daisied path Of Poverty, And know how more A small thing that the righteous hath Availeth than the ungodly's riches great. Come likewise ye Which do not yet disown as out of date That brightest third of the dead Virtues three, Of Love the crown elate And daintiest glee! Come up, come up, and join our little band. Our time is near at hand. The sanction of the world's undying hate Means more than flaunted flags in windy air. Be ye of gathering fate Now gladly ware. Now from the matrix, by God's grinding wrought, The brilliant shall be brought; The white stone mystic set between the eyes Of them that get the prize; Yea, part and parcel of that mighty Stone Which shall be thrown Into the Sea, and Sea shall be no more. V SPONSA DEI What is this Maiden fair, The laughing of whose eye Is in man's heart renew'd virginity; Who yet sick longing breeds For marriage which exceeds The inventive guess of Love to satisfy With hope of utter binding, and of loosing endless dear despair? What gleams about her shine, More transient than delight and more divine! If she does something but a little sweet, As gaze towards the glass to set her hair, See how his soul falls humbled at her feet! Her gentle step, to go or come, Gains her more merit than a martyrdom; And, if she dance, it doth such grace confer As opes the heaven of heavens to more than her, And makes a rival of her worshipper. To die unknown for her were little cost! So is she without guile, Her mere refused smile Makes up the sum of that which may be lost! Who is this Fair Whom each hath seen, The darkest once in this bewailed dell, Be he not destin'd for the glooms of hell? Whom each hath seen And known, with sharp remorse and sweet, as Queen And tear-glad Mistress of his hopes of bliss, Too fair for man to kiss? Who is this only happy She, Whom, by a frantic flight of courtesy, Born of despair Of better lodging for his Spirit fair, He adores as Margaret, Maude, or Cecily? And what this sigh, That each one heaves for Earth's last lowlihead And the Heaven high Ineffably lock'd in dateless bridal-bed? Are all, then, mad, or is it prophecy? ‘Sons now we are of God,’ as we have heard, ‘But what we shall be hath not yet appear'd.’ O, Heart, remember thee, That Man is none, Save One. What if this Lady be thy Soul, and He Who claims to enjoy her sacred beauty be, Not thou, but God; and thy sick fire A female vanity, Such as a Bride, viewing her mirror'd charms, Feels when she sighs, ‘All these are for his arms!’ A reflex heat Flash'd on thy cheek from His immense desire, Which waits to crown, beyond thy brain's conceit, Thy nameless, secret, hopeless longing sweet, Not by-and-by, but now, Unless deny Him thou! VI LEGEM TUAM DILEXI The ‘Infinite.’ Word horrible! at feud With life, and the braced mood Of power and joy and love; Forbidden, by wise heathen ev'n, to be Spoken of Deity, Whose Name, on popular altars, was ‘The Unknown,’ Because, or ere It was reveal'd as One Confined in Three, The people fear'd that it might prove Infinity, The blazon which the devils desired to gain; And God, for their confusion, laugh'd consent; Yet did so far relent, That they might seek relief, and not in vain, In dashing of themselves against the shores of pain. Nor bides alone in hell The bond-disdaining spirit boiling to rebel. But for compulsion of strong grace, The pebble in the road Would straight explode, And fill the ghastly boundlessness of space. The furious power, To soft growth twice constrain'd in leaf and flower, Protests, and longs to flash its faint self far Beyond the dimmest star. The same Seditious flame, Beat backward with reduplicated might, Struggles alive within its stricter term, And is the worm. And the just Man does on himself affirm God's limits, and is conscious of delight, Freedom and right; And so His Semblance is, Who, every hour, By day and night, Buildeth new bulwarks 'gainst the Infinite. For, ah, who can express How full of bonds and simpleness Is God, How narrow is He, And how the wide, waste field of possibility Is only trod Straight to His homestead in the human heart, And all His art Is as the babe's that wins his Mother to repeat Her little song so sweet! What is the chief news of the Night? Lo, iron and salt, heat, weight and light In every star that drifts on the great breeze! And these Mean Man, Darling of God, Whose thoughts but live and move Round him; Who woos his will To wedlock with His own, and does distil To that drop's span The atta of all rose-fields of all love! Therefore the soul select assumes the stress Of bonds unbid, which God's own style express Better than well, And aye hath, cloister'd, borne, To the Clown's scorn, The fetters of the threefold golden chain: Narrowing to nothing all his wordly gain; (Howbeit in vain; For to have nought Is to have all things without care or thought!) Surrendering, abject, to his equal's rule, As though he were a fool, The free wings of the will; (More vainly still; For none knows rightly what 'tis to be free But only he Who, vow'd against all choice, and fill'd with awe Of the ofttimes dumb or clouded Oracle, Does wiser than to spell, In his own suit, the least word of the Law!) And, lastly, bartering life's dear bliss for pain; But evermore in vain; For joy (rejoice ye Few that tasted have!) Is Love's obedience Against the genial laws of natural sense, Whose wide, self-dissipating wave, Prison'd in artful dykes, Trembling returns and strikes Thence to its source again, In backward billows fleet, Crest crossing crest ecstatic as they greet, Thrilling each vein, Exploring every chasm and cove Of the full heart with floods of honied love, And every principal street And obscure alley and lane Of the intricate brain With brimming rivers of light and breezes sweet Of the primordial heat; Till, unto view of me and thee, Lost the intense life be, Or ludicrously display'd, by force Of distance; as a soaring eagle, or a horse On far-off hillside shewn, May seem a gust-driv'n rag or a dead stone. Nor by such bonds alone— But more I leave to say, Fitly revering the Wild Ass's bray, Also his hoof, Of which, go where you will, the marks remain Where the religious walls have hid the bright reproof. VII TO THE BODY Creation's and Creator's crowning good; Wall of infinitude; Foundation of the sky, In Heaven forecast And long'd for from eternity, Though laid the last; Reverberating dome, Of music cunningly built home Against the void and indolent disgrace Of unresponsive space; Little, sequester'd pleasure-house For God and for His Spouse; Elaborately, yea, past conceiving, fair, Since, from the graced decorum of the hair, Ev'n to the tingling, sweet Soles of the simple, earth-confiding feet, And from the inmost heart Outwards unto the thin Silk curtains of the skin, Every least part Astonish'd hears And sweet replies to some like region of the spheres; Form'd for a dignity prophets but darkly name, Lest shameless men cry ‘Shame!’ So rich with wealth conceal'd That Heaven and Hell fight chiefly for this field; Clinging to everything that pleases thee With indefectible fidelity; Alas, so true To all thy friendships that no grace Thee from thy sin can wholly disembrace; Which thus 'bides with thee as the Jebusite, That, maugre all God's promises could do, The chosen People never conquer'd quite; Who therefore lived with them, And that by formal truce and as of right, In metropolitan Jerusalem. For which false fealty Thou needs must, for a season, lie In the grave's arms, foul and unshriven, Albeit, in Heaven, Thy crimson-throbbing Glow Into its old abode aye pants to go, And does with envy see Enoch, Elijah, and the Lady, she Who left the roses in her body's lieu. O, if the pleasures I have known in thee But my poor faith's poor first-fruits be, What quintessential, keen, ethereal bliss Then shall be his Who has thy birth-time's consecrating dew For death's sweet chrism retain'd, Quick, tender, virginal, and unprofaned! VIII ‘SING US ONE OF THE SONGS OF SION’ How sing the Lord's Song in so strange a Land? A torrid waste of water-mocking sand; Oases of wild grapes; A dull, malodorous fog O'er a once Sacred River's wandering strand, Its ancient tillage all gone back to bog; A busy synod of blest cats and apes Exposing the poor trick of earth and star With worshipp'd snouts oracular; Prophets to whose blind stare The heavens the glory of God do not declare, Skill'd in such question nice As why one conjures toads who fails with lice, And hatching snakes from sticks in such a swarm As quite to surfeit Aaron's bigger worm; A nation which has got A lie in her right hand, And knows it not; With Pharaohs to her mind, each drifting as a log Which way the foul stream flows, More harden'd the more plagued with fly and frog! How should sad Exile sing in such a Land? How should ye understand? What could he win but jeers, Or howls, such as sweet music draws from dog, Who told of marriage-feasting to the man That nothing knows of food but bread of bran? Besides, if aught such ears Might e'er unclog, There lives but one, with tones for Sion meet. Behoveful, zealous, beautiful, elect, Mild, firm, judicious, loving, bold, discreet, Without superfluousness, without defect, Few are his words, and find but scant respect, Nay, scorn from some, for God's good cause agog. Silence in such a Land is oftenest such men's speech. O, that I might his holy secret reach; O, might I catch his mantle when he goes; O, that I were so gentle and so sweet, So I might deal fair Sion's foolish foes Such blows! IX DELICIÆ SAPIENTIÆ DE AMORE Love, light for me Thy ruddiest blazing torch, That I, albeit a beggar by the Porch Of the glad Palace of Virginity, May gaze within, and sing the pomp I see; For, crown'd with roses all, 'Tis there, O Love, they keep thy festival! But first warn off the beatific spot Those wretched who have not Even afar beheld the shining wall, And those who, once beholding, have forgot, And those, most vile, who dress The charnel spectre drear Of utterly dishallow'd nothingness In that refulgent fame, And cry, Lo, here! And name The Lady whose smiles inflame The sphere. Bring, Love, anear, And bid be not afraid Young Lover true, and love-foreboding Maid, And wedded Spouse, if virginal of thought; For I will sing of nought Less sweet to hear Than seems A music in their half-remember'd dreams. The magnet calls the steel: Answers the iron to the magnet's breath; What do they feel But death! The clouds of summer kiss in flame and rain, And are not found again; But the heavens themselves eternal are with fire Of unapproach'd desire, By the aching heart of Love, which cannot rest, In blissfullest pathos so indeed possess'd. O, spousals high; O, doctrine blest, Unutterable in even the happiest sigh; This know ye all Who can recall With what a welling of indignant tears Love's simpleness first hears The meaning of his mortal covenant, And from what pride comes down To wear the crown Of which 'twas very heaven to feel the want. How envies he the ways Of yonder hopeless star, And so would laugh and yearn With trembling lids eterne, Ineffably content from infinitely far Only to gaze On his bright Mistress's responding rays, That never know eclipse; And, once in his long year, With præternuptial ecstasy and fear, By the delicious law of that ellipse Wherein all citizens of ether move, With hastening pace to come Nearer, though never near, His Love And always inaccessible sweet Home; There on his path doubly to burn. Kiss'd by her doubled light That whispers of its source, The ardent secret ever clothed with Night, Then go forth in new force Towards a new return, Rejoicing as a Bridegroom on his course! This know ye all; Therefore gaze bold, That so in you be joyful hope increas'd, Thorough the Palace portals, and behold The dainty and unsating Marriage-Feast. O, hear Them singing clear ‘Cor meum et caro mea’ round the ‘I am,’ The Husband of the Heavens, and the Lamb Whom they for ever follow there that kept, Or losing, never slept Till they reconquer'd had in mortal fight The standard white. O, hear From the harps they bore from Earth, five-strung, what music springs, While the glad Spirits chide The wondering strings! And how the shining sacrificial Choirs, Offering for aye their dearest hearts' desires, Which to their hearts come back beatified, Hymn, the bright aisles along, The nuptial song, Song ever new to us and them, that saith, ‘Hail Virgin in Virginity a Spouse!’ Heard first below Within the little house At Nazareth; Heard yet in many a cell where brides of Christ Lie hid, emparadised, And where, although By the hour 'tis night, There's light, The Day still lingering in the lap of snow. Gaze and be not afraid Ye wedded few that honour, in sweet thought And glittering will, So freshly from the garden gather still The lily sacrificed; For ye, though self-suspected here for nought, Are highly styled With the thousands twelve times twelve of undefiled. Gaze and be not afraid Young Lover true and love-foreboding Maid. The full noon of deific vision bright Abashes nor abates No spark minute of Nature's keen delight. 'Tis there your Hymen waits! There where in courts afar, all unconfused, they crowd, As fumes the starlight soft In gulfs of cloud, And each to the other, well-content, Sighs oft, ‘'Twas this we meant!’ Gaze without blame Ye in whom living Love yet blushes for dead shame. There of pure Virgins none Is fairer seen, Save One, Than Mary Magdalene. Gaze without doubt or fear Ye to whom generous Love, by any name, is dear. Love makes the life to be A fount perpetual of virginity; For, lo, the Elect Of generous Love, how named soe'er, affect Nothing but God, Or mediate or direct, Nothing but God, The Husband of the Heavens: And who Him love, in potence great or small, Are, one and all, Heirs of the Palace glad, And inly clad With the bridal robes of ardour virginal. X THE CRY AT MIDNIGHT The Midge's wing beats to and fro A thousand times ere one can utter ‘O!’ And Sirius' ball Does on his business run As many times immenser than the Sun. Why should things not be great as well as small, Or move like light as well as move at all? St. Michael fills his place, I mine, and, if you please, We will respect each other's provinces, I marv'lling not at him, nor he at me. But, if thou must go gaping, let it be That One who could make Michael should make thee. O, foolish Man, meeting things low and high By self, that accidental quantity! With this conceit, Philosophy stalks frail As peacock staggering underneath his tail. Who judge of Plays from their own penny gaff, At God's great theatre will hiss and laugh; For what's a Saint to them Brought up in modern virtues brummagem? With garments grimed and lamps gone all to snuff, And counting others for like Virgins queer, To list those others cry, ‘Our Bridegroom's near!’ Meaning their God, is surely quite enough To make them rend their clothes and bawl out, ‘Blasphemy!’ XI AURAS OF DELIGHT Beautiful habitations, auras of delight! Who shall bewail the crags and bitter foam And angry sword-blades flashing left and right Which guard your glittering height, That none thereby may come! The vision which we have Revere we so, That yet we crave To foot those fields of ne'er-profaned snow? I, with heart-quake, Dreaming or thinking of that realm of Love, See, oft, a dove Tangled in frightful nuptials with a snake; The tortured knot, Now, like a kite scant-weighted, flung bewitch'd Sunwards, now pitch'd, Tail over head, down, but with no taste got Eternally Of rest in either ruin or the sky, But bird and vermin each incessant strives, With vain dilaceration of both lives, 'Gainst its abhorred bond insoluble, Coveting fiercer any separate hell Than the most weary Soul in Purgatory On God's sweet breast to lie. And, in this sign, I con The guerdon of that golden Cup, fulfill'd With fornications foul of Babylon, The heart where good is well-perceiv'd and known, Yet is not will'd; And Him I thank, who can make live again, The dust, but not the joy we once profane, That I, of ye, Beautiful habitations, auras of delight, In childish years and since had sometime sense and sight, But that ye vanish'd quite, Even from memory, Ere I could get my breath, and whisper ‘See!’ But did for me They altogether die, Those trackless glories glimps'd in upper sky? Were they of chance, or vain, Nor good at all again For curb of heart or fret? Nay, though, by grace, Lest, haply, I refuse God to His face, Their likeness wholly I forget, Ah, yet, Often in straits which else for me were ill, I mind me still I did respire the lonely auras sweet, I did the blest abodes behold, and, at the mountains' feet, Bathed in the holy Stream by Hermon's thymy hill. XII EROS AND PSYCHE ‘Love, I heard tell of thee so oft! Yea, thrice my face and bosom flush'd with heat Of sudden wings, Through delicatest ether feathering soft Their solitary beat. Long did I muse what service or what charms Might lure thee, blissful Bird, into mine arms; And nets I made, But not of the fit strings. At last, of endless failure much afraid, To-night I would do nothing but lie still, And promise, wert thou once within my window-sill, Thine unknown will. In nets' default, Finch-like me seem'd thou might'st be ta'en with salt; And here—and how thou mad'st me start!— Thou art.’ ‘O Mortal, by Immortals' cunning led, Who shew'd you how for Gods to bait your bed? Ah, Psyche, guess'd you nought I craved but to be caught? Wanton, it was not you, But I that did so passionately sue; And for your beauty, not unscath'd, I fought With Hades, ere I own'd in you a thought!’ ‘O, heavenly Lover true, Is this thy mouth upon my forehead press'd? Are these thine arms about my bosom link'd? Are these thy hands that tremble near my heart, Where join two hearts, for juncture more distinct? By thee and by my maiden zone caress'd, What dim, waste tracts of life shine sudden, like moonbeams On windless ocean shaken by sweet dreams! Ah, stir not to depart! Kiss me again, thy Wife and Virgin too! O Love, that, like a rose, Deckest my breast with beautiful repose, Kiss me again, and clasp me round the heart, Till fill'd with thee am I As the cocoon is with the butterfly! —Yet how 'scape quite Nor pluck pure pleasure with profane delight? How know I that my Love is what he seems! Give me a sign That, in the pitchy night, Comes to my pillow an immortal Spouse, And not a fiend, hiding with happy boughs Of palm and asphodel The pits of hell!’ ‘'Tis this: I make the childless to keep joyful house. Below your bosom, mortal Mistress mine, Immortal by my kiss, Leaps what sweet pain? A fiend, my Psyche, comes with barren bliss, A God's embraces never are in vain.’ ‘I own A life not mine within my golden zone. Yea, how 'Tis easier grown Thine arduous rule to don Than for a Bride to put her bride-dress on! Nay, rather, now 'Tis no more service to be borne serene, Whither thou wilt, thy stormful wings between. But, Oh, Can I endure This flame, yet live for what thou lov'st me, pure?’ ‘Himself the God let blame If all about him bursts to quenchless flame! My Darling, know Your spotless fairness is not match'd in snow, But in the integrity of fire. Whate'er you are, Sweet, I require. A sorry God were he That fewer claim'd than all Love's mighty kingdoms three!’ ‘Much marvel I That thou, the greatest of the Powers above, Me visitest with such exceeding love. What thing is this? A God to make me, nothing, needful to his bliss, And humbly wait my favour for a kiss! Yea, all thy legions of liege deity To look into this mystery desire.’ ‘Content you, Dear, with them, this marvel to admire, And lay your foolish little head to rest On my familiar breast. Should a high King, leaving his arduous throne, Sue from her hedge a little Gipsy Maid, For far-off royal ancestry bewray'd By some wild beauties, to herself unknown; Some voidness of herself in her strange ways Which to his bounteous fulness promised dainty praise; Some power, by all but him unguess'd, Of growing king-like were she king-caress'd; And should he bid his dames of loftiest grade Put off her rags and make her lowlihead Pure for the soft midst of his perfumed bed, So to forget, kind-couch'd with her alone, His empire, in her winsome joyance free; What would he do, if such a fool were she As at his grandeur there to gape and quake, Mindless of love's supreme equality, And of his heart, so simple for her sake That all he ask'd, for making her all-blest, Was that her nothingness alway Should yield such easy fee as frank to play Or sleep delighted in her Monarch's breast, Feeling her nothingness her giddiest boast, As being the charm for which he loved her most? What if this reed, Through which the King thought love-tunes to have blown, Should shriek, “Indeed, I am too base to trill so blest a tone! Would not the King allege Defaulted consummation of the marriage-pledge, And hie the Gipsy to her native hedge?’ ‘O, too much joy; O, touch of airy fire; O, turmoil of content; O, unperturb'd desire, From founts of spirit impell'd through brain and blood! I'll not call ill what, since 'tis thine, is good, Nor best what is but second best or third; Still my heart fails, And, unaccustom'd and astonish'd, quails, And blames me, though I think I have not err'd. 'Tis hard for fly, in such a honied flood, To use her eyes, far more her wings or feet. Bitter be thy behests! Lie like a bunch of myrrh between my aching breasts. Some greatly pangful penance would I brave. Sharpness me save From being slain by sweet!’ ‘In your dell'd bosom's double peace Let all care cease! Custom's joy-killing breath Shall bid you sigh full soon for custom-killing death. So clasp your childish arms again around my heart: 'Tis but in such captivity The unbounded Heav'ns know what they be! And lie still there, Till the dawn, threat'ning to declare My beauty, which you cannot bear, Bid me depart. Suffer your soul's delight, Lest that which is to come wither you quite: For these are only your espousals; yes, More intimate and fruitfuller far Than aptest mortal nuptials are; But nuptials wait you such as now you dare not guess.’ ‘In all I thee obey! And thus I know That all is well: Should'st thou me tell Out of thy warm caress to go And roll my body in the biting snow, My very body's joy were but increased; More pleasant 'tis to please thee than be pleased. Thy love has conquer'd me; do with me as thou wilt,’ And use me as a chattel that is thine! Kiss, tread me under foot, cherish or beat, Sheathe in my heart sharp pain up to the hilt, Invent what else were most perversely sweet; Nay, let the Fiend drag me through dens of guilt; Let Earth, Heav'n, Hell 'Gainst my content combine; What could make nought the touch that made thee mine! Ah, say not yet, farewell!’ ‘Nay, that's the Blackbird's note, the sweet Night's knell. Behold, Beloved, the penance you would brave!’ ‘Curs'd when it comes, the bitter thing we crave! Thou leav'st me now, like to the moon at dawn, A little, vacuous world alone in air. I will not care! When dark comes back my dark shall be withdrawn! Go free; For 'tis with me As when the cup the Child scoops in the sand Fills, and is part and parcel of the Sea. I'll say it to myself and understand. Farewell! Go as thou wilt and come! Lover divine, Thou still art jealously and wholly mine; And this thy kiss A separate secret by none other scann'd; Though well I wis The whole of life is womanhood to thee, Momently wedded with enormous bliss. Rainbow, that hast my heaven sudden spann d, I am the apple of thy glorious gaze, Each else life cent'ring to a different blaze; And, nothing though I be But now a no more void capacity for thee, 'Tis all to know there's not in air or land Another for thy Darling quite like me! Mine arms no more thy restless plumes compel! Farewell! Whilst thou art gone, I'll search the weary meads To deck my bed with lilies of fair deeds! And, if thou choose to come this eventide, A touch, my Love, will set my casement wide. Farewell, farewell! Be my dull days Music, at least, with thy remember'd praise!’ ‘Bitter, sweet, few and veil'd let be Your songs of me. Preserving bitter, very sweet, Few, that so all may be discreet, And veil'd, that, seeing, none may see.’ XIII DE NATURA DEORUM ‘Good-morrow, Psyche! What's thine errand now? What awful pleasure do thine eyes bespeak, What shame is in thy childish cheek, What terror on thy brow? Is this my Psyche, once so pale and meek? Thy body's sudden beauty my sight old Stings, like an agile bead of boiling gold, And all thy life looks troubled like a tree's Whose boughs wave many ways in one great breeze.’ ‘O Pythoness, to strangest story hark: A dreadful God was with me in the dark—’ ‘How many a Maid— Has never told me that! And thou'rt afraid—’ ‘He'll come no more, Or come but twice, Or thrice, Or only thrice ten thousand times thrice o'er!’ ‘For want of wishing thou mean'st not to miss. We know the Lover, Psyche, by the kiss!’ ‘If speech of honey could impart the sweet, The world were all in tears and at his feet! But not to tell of that in tears come I, but this: I'm foolish, weak, and small, And fear to fall. If long he stay away, O frightful dream, wise Mother, What keeps me but that I, gone crazy, kiss some other!’ ‘The fault were his! But know, Sweet little Daughter sad, He did but feign to go; And never more Shall cross thy window-sill, Or pass beyond thy door, Save by thy will. He's present now in some dim place apart Of the ivory house wherewith thou mad'st him glad. Nay, this I whisper thee, Since none is near, Or, if one were, since only thou could'st hear, That happy thing which makes thee flush and start, Like infant lips in contact with thy heart, Is He!’ ‘Yea, this I know, but never can believe! O, hateful light! when shall mine own eyes mark My beauty, which this victory did achieve?’ ‘When thou, like Gods and owls, canst see by dark.’ ‘In vain I cleanse me from all blurring error—’ ‘'Tis the last rub that polishes the mirror.’ ‘It takes fresh blurr each breath which I respire.’ ‘Poor Child, don't cry so! Hold it to the fire.’ ‘Ah, nought these dints can e'er do out again!’ ‘Love is not love which does not sweeter live For having something dreadful to forgive.’ ‘Sadness and change and pain Shall me for ever stain; For, though my blissful fate Be for a billion years, How shall I stop my tears That life was once so low and Love arrived so late!’ ‘Sadness is beauty's savour, and pain is The exceedingly keen edge of bliss; Nor, without swift mutation, would the heav'ns be aught.’ ‘How to behave with him I'd fain be taught. A maid, meseems, within a God's embrace, Should bear her like a Goddess, or, at least, a Grace.’ ‘When Gods, to Man or Maid below, As men or birds appear, A kind 'tis of incognito, And that, not them, is what they choose we should revere.’ ‘Advise me what oblation vast to bring, Some least part of my worship to confess!’ ‘A woman is a little thing, And in things little lies her comeliness.’ ‘Must he not soon with mortal tire to toy?’ ‘The bashful meeting of strange Depth and Height Breeds the forever new-born babe, Delight; And, as thy God is more than mortal boy, So bashful more the meeting, and so more the joy.’ ‘He loves me dearly, but he shakes a whip Of deathless scorpions at my slightest slip. Mother, last night he call'd me “Gipsy,” so Roughly it smote me like a blow! Yet, oh, I love him, as none surely e'er could love Our People's pompous but good-natured Jove. He used to send me stately overture; But marriage-bonds, till now, I never could endure!’ ‘How should great Jove himself do else than miss To win the woman he forgets to kiss; Or, won, to keep his favour in her eyes, If he's too soft or sleepy to chastise! By Eros, her twain claims are ne'er forgot; Her wedlock's marr'd when either's miss'd: Or when she's kiss'd, but beaten not, Or duly beaten, but not kiss'd. Ah, Child, the sweet Content, when we're both kiss'd and beat! —But whence these wounds? What Demon thee enjoins To scourge thy shoulders white And tender loins!’ ‘'Tis nothing, Mother. Happiness at play, And speech of tenderness no speech can say!’ ‘How learn'd thou art! Twelve honeymoons profane had taught thy docile heart Less than thine Eros, in a summer night!’ ‘Nay, do not jeer, but help my puzzled plight: Because he loves so marvellously me, And I with all he loves in love must be, How to except myself I do not see. Yea, now that other vanities are vain, I'm vain, since him it likes, of being withal Weak, foolish, small!’ ‘How can a Maid forget her ornaments! The Powers, that hopeless doom the proud to die, Unask'd smile pardon upon vanity, Nay, praise it, when themselves are praised thereby.’ ‘Ill-match'd I am for a God's blandishments! So great, so wise—’ ‘Gods, in the abstract, are, no doubt, most wise; But, in the concrete, Girl, they're mysteries! He's not with thee, At all less wise nor more Than human Lover is with her he deigns to adore. He finds a fair capacity, And fills it with himself, and glad would die For that sole She.’ ‘Know'st thou some potion me awake to keep, Lest, to the grief of that ne'er-slumbering Bliss, Disgraced I sleep, Wearied in soul by his bewildering kiss?’ ‘The Immortals, Psyche, moulded men from sods That Maids from them might learn the ways of Gods. Think, would a wakeful Youth his hard fate weep, Lock'd to the tired breast of a Bride asleep?’ ‘Ah, me, I do not dream, Yet all this does some heathen fable seem!’ ‘O'ermuch thou mind'st the throne he leaves above! Between unequals sweet is equal love.’ ‘Nay, Mother, in his breast, when darkness blinds, I cannot for my life but talk and laugh With the large impudence of little minds!’ ‘Respectful to the Gods and meek, According to one's lights, I grant 'Twere well to be; But, on my word, Child, any one, to hear you speak, Would take you for a Protestant, (Such fish I do foresee When the charm'd fume comes strong on me,) Or powder'd lackey, by some great man's board, A deal more solemn than his Lord! Know'st thou not, Girl, thine Eros loves to laugh? And shall a God do anything by half? He foreknew and predestinated all The Great must pay for kissing things so small, And ever loves his little Maid the more The more she makes him laugh.’ ‘O, Mother, are you sure?’ ‘Gaze steady where yon starless deep the gaze revolts, And say, Seest thou a Titan forging thunderbolts, Or three fair butterflies at lovesome play? And this I'll add, for succour of thy soul: Lines parallel meet sooner than some think; The least part oft is greater than the whole; And, when you're thirsty, that's the time to drink.’ ‘Thy sacred words I ponder and revere, And thank thee heartily that some are clear.’ ‘Clear speech to men is mostly speech in vain, Their scope is by themselves so justly scann'd, They still despise the things they understand; But, to a pretty Maid like thee, I don't mind speaking plain.’ ‘Then one boon more to her whom strange Fate mocks With a wife's duty but no wife's sweet right: Could I at will but summon my Delight—’ ‘Thou of thy Jewel art the dainty box; Thine is the charm which, any time, unlocks; And this, it seems, thou hitt'st upon last night. Now go, Child! For thy sake I've talk'd till this stiff tripod makes my old limbs ache.’ XIV PSYCHE'S DISCONTENT ‘Enough, enough, ambrosial plumed Boy! My bosom is aweary of thy breath. Thou kissest joy To death. Have pity of my clay-conceived birth And maiden's simple mood, Which longs for ether and infinitude, As thou, being God, crav'st littleness and earth! Thou art immortal, thou canst ever toy, Nor savour less The sweets of thine eternal childishness, And hold thy godhead bright in far employ. Me, to quite other custom life-inured, Ah, loose from thy caress. 'Tis not to be endured! Undo thine arms and let me see the sky, By this infatuating flame obscured. O, I should feel thee nearer to my heart If thou and I Shone each to each respondently apart, Like stars which one the other trembling spy, Distinct and lucid in extremes of air. O, hear me pray—’ ‘Be prudent in thy prayer! A God is bond to her who is wholly his, And, should she ask amiss, He may not her beseeched harm deny.’ ‘Not yet, not yet! 'Tis still high day, and half my toil's to do. How can I toil, if thus thou dost renew Toil's guerdon, which the daytime should forget? The long, long night, when none can work for fear, Sweet fear incessantly consummated, My most divinely Dear, My Joy, my Dread, Will soon be here! Not, Eros, yet! I ask, for Day, the use which is the Wife's: To bear, apart from thy delight and thee, The fardel coarse of customary life's Exceeding injucundity. Leave me awhile, that I may shew thee clear How Goddess-like thy love has lifted me; How, seeming lone upon the gaunt, lone shore, I'll trust thee near, When thou'rt, to knowledge of my heart, no more Than a dream's heed Of lost joy track'd in scent of the sea-weed! Leave me to pluck the incomparable flower Of frailty lion-like fighting in thy name and power; To make thee laugh, in thy safe heaven, to see With what grip fell I'll cling to hope when life draws hard to hell, Yea, cleave to thee when me thou seem'st to slay, Haply, at close of some most cruel day, To find myself in thy reveal'd arms clasp'd, Just when I say, My feet have slipp'd at last! But, lo, while thus I store toil's slow increase, To be my dower, in patience and in peace, Thou com'st, like bolt from blue, invisibly, With premonition none nor any sign, And, at a gasp, no choice nor fault of mine, Possess'd I am with thee Ev'n as a sponge is by a surge of the sea!’ ‘Thus irresistibly by Love embraced Is she who boasts her more than mortal chaste!’ ‘Find'st thou me worthy, then, by day and night, But of this fond indignity, delight?’ ‘Little, bold Femininity, That darest blame Heaven, what would'st thou have or be?’ ‘Shall I, the gnat which dances in thy ray, Dare to be reverent? Therefore dare I say, I cannot guess the good that I desire; But this I know, I spurn the gifts which Hell Can mock till which is which 'tis hard to tell. I love thee, God; yea, and 'twas such assault As this which made me thine; if that be fault; But I, thy Mistress, merit should thine ire If aught so little, transitory and low As this which made me thine Should hold me so.’ ‘Little to thee, my Psyche, is this, but much to me!’ ‘Ah, if, my God, that be!’ ‘Yea, Palate fine, That claim'st for thy proud cup the pearl of price, And scorn'st the wine, Accept the sweet, and say 'tis sacrifice! Sleep, Centre to the tempest of my love, And dream thereof, And keep the smile which sleeps within thy face Like sunny eve in some forgotten place!’ XV PAIN O, Pain, Love's mystery, Close next of kin To joy and heart's delight, Low Pleasure's opposite, Choice food of sanctity And medicine of sin, Angel, whom even they that will pursue Pleasure with hell's whole gust Find that they must Perversely woo, My lips, thy live coal touching, speak thee true. Thou sear'st my flesh, O Pain, But brand'st for arduous peace my languid brain, And bright'nest my dull view, Till I, for blessing, blessing give again, And my roused spirit is Another fire of bliss, Wherein I learn Feelingly how the pangful, purging fire Shall furiously burn With joy, not only of assured desire, But also present joy Of seeing the life's corruption, stain by stain, Vanish in the clear heat of Love irate, And, fume by fume, the sick alloy Of luxury, sloth and hate Evaporate; Leaving the man, so dark erewhile, The mirror merely of God's smile. Herein, O Pain, abides the praise For which my song I raise; But even the bastard good of intermittent ease How greatly doth it please! With what repose The being from its bright exertion glows, When from thy strenuous storm the senses sweep Into a little harbour deep Of rest; When thou, O Pain, Having devour'd the nerves that thee sustain, Sleep'st, till thy tender food be somewhat grown again; And how the lull With tear-blind love is full! What mockery of a man am I express'd That I should wait for thee To woo! Nor even dare to love, till thou lov'st me. How shameful, too, Is this: That, when thou lov'st, I am at first afraid Of thy fierce kiss, Like a young maid; And only trust thy charms And get my courage in thy throbbing arms. And, when thou partest, what a fickle mind Thou leav'st behind, That, being a little absent from mine eye, It straight forgets thee what thou art, And ofttimes my adulterate heart Dallies with Pleasure, thy pale enemy. O, for the learned spirit without attaint That does not faint, But knows both how to have thee and to lack And ventures many a spell, Unlawful but for them that love so well, To call thee back. XVI PROPHETS WHO CANNOT SING Ponder, ye Just, the scoffs that frequent go From forth the foe: ‘The holders of the Truth in Verity Are people of a harsh and stammering tongue! The hedge-flower hath its song; Meadow and tree, Water and wandering cloud Find Seers who see, And, with convincing music clear and loud, Startle the adder-deafness of the crowd By tones, O Love, from thee. Views of the unveil'd heavens alone forth bring Prophets who cannot sing, Praise that in chiming numbers will not run; At least, from David until Dante, none, And none since him. Fish, and not swim? They think they somehow should, and so they try But (haply 'tis they screw the pitch too high) 'Tis still their fates To warble tunes that nails might draw from slates. Poor Seraphim! They mean to spoil our sleep, and do, but all their gains Are curses for their pains!’ Now who but knows That truth to learn from foes Is wisdom ripe? Therefore no longer let us stretch our throats Till hoarse as frogs With straining after notes Which but to touch would burst an organ-pipe. Far better be dumb dogs. XVII THE CHILD'S PURCHASE A PROLOGUE As a young Child, whose Mother, for a jest, To his own use a golden coin flings down, Devises blythe how he may spend it best, Or on a horse, a bride-cake, or a crown, Till, wearied with his quest, Nor liking altogether that nor this, He gives it back for nothing but a kiss, Endow'd so I With golden speech, my choice of toys to buy, And scanning power and pleasure and renown, Till each in turn, with looking at, looks vain, For her mouth's bliss, To her who gave it give I it again. Ah, Lady elect, Whom the Time's scorn has saved from its respect, Would I had art For uttering this which sings within my heart! But, lo, Thee to admire is all the art I know. My Mother and God's; Fountain of miracle! Give me thereby some praise of thee to tell In such a Song As may my Guide severe and glad not wrong Who never spake till thou'dst on him conferr'd The right, convincing word! Grant me the steady heat Of thought wise, splendid, sweet, Urged by the great, rejoicing wind that rings With draught of unseen wings, Making each phrase, for love and for delight, Twinkle like Sirius on a frosty night! Aid thou thine own dear fame, thou only Fair, At whose petition meek The Heavens themselves decree that, as it were, They will be weak! Thou Speaker of all wisdom in a Word, Thy Lord! Speaker who thus could'st well afford Thence to be silent;—ah, what silence that Which had for prologue thy ‘Magnificat?’— O, Silence full of wonders More than by Moses in the Mount were heard, More than were utter'd by the Seven Thunders; Silence that crowns, unnoted, like the voiceless blue, The loud world's varying view, And in its holy heart the sense of all things ponders! That acceptably I may speak of thee, Ora pro me! Key-note and stop Of the thunder-going chorus of sky-Powers; Essential drop Distill'd from worlds of sweetest-savour'd flowers To anoint with nuptial praise The Head which for thy Beauty doff'd its rays, And thee, in His exceeding glad descending, meant, And Man's new days Made of His deed the adorning accident! Vast Nothingness of Self, fair female Twin Of Fulness, sucking all God's glory in! (Ah, Mistress mine, To nothing I have added only sin, And yet would shine!) Ora pro me! Life's cradle and death's tomb! To lie within whose womb, There, with divine self-will infatuate, Love-captive to the thing He did create, Thy God did not abhor, No more That Man, in Youth's high spousal-tide, Abhors at last to touch The strange lips of his long-procrastinating Bride; Nay, not the least imagined part as much! Ora pro me! My Lady, yea, the Lady of my Lord, Who didst the first descry The burning secret of virginity, We know with what reward! Prism whereby Alone we see Heav'n's light in its triplicity; Rainbow complex In bright distinction of all beams of sex, Shining for aye In the simultaneous sky, To One, thy Husband, Father, Son, and Brother, Spouse blissful, Daughter, Sister, milk-sweet Mother; Ora pro me! Mildness, whom God obeys, obeying thyself Him in thy joyful Saint, nigh lost to sight In the great gulf Of his own glory and thy neighbour light; With whom thou wast as else with husband none For perfect fruit of inmost amity; Who felt for thee Such rapture of refusal that no kiss Ever seal'd wedlock so conjoint with bliss; And whose good singular eternally 'Tis now, with nameless peace and vehemence, To enjoy thy married smile, That mystery of innocence; Ora pro me! Sweet Girlhood without guile, The extreme of God's creative energy; Sunshiny Peak of human personality; The world's sad aspirations' one Success; Bright Blush, that sav'st our shame from shamelessness; Chief Stone of stumbling; Sign built in the way To set the foolish everywhere a-bray; Hem of God's robe, which all who touch are heal'd; To which the outside Many honour yield With a reward and grace Unguess'd by the unwash'd boor that hails Him to His face, Spurning the safe, ingratiant courtesy Of suing Him by thee; Ora pro me! Creature of God rather the sole than first; Knot of the cord Which binds together all and all unto their Lord; Suppliant Omnipotence; best to the worst; Our only Saviour from an abstract Christ And Egypt's brick-kilns, where the lost crowd plods, Blaspheming its false Gods; Peace-beaming Star, by which shall come enticed, Though nought thereof as yet they weet, Unto thy Babe's small feet, The Mighty, wand'ring disemparadised, Like Lucifer, because to thee They will not bend the knee; Ora pro me! Desire of Him whom all things else desire! Bush aye with Him as He with thee on fire! Neither in His great Deed nor on His throne— O, folly of Love, the intense Last culmination of Intelligence,— Him seem'd it good that God should be alone! Basking in unborn laughter of thy lips, Ere the world was, with absolute delight His Infinite reposed in thy Finite; Well-match'd: He, universal being's Spring, And thou, in whom art gather'd up the ends of everything! Ora pro me! In season due, on His sweet-fearful bed, Rock'd by an earthquake, curtain'd with eclipse, Thou shar'd'st the rapture of the sharp spear's head, And thy bliss pale Wrought for our boon what Eve's did for our bale; Thereafter, holding a little thy soft breath, Thou underwent'st the ceremony of death; And, now, Queen-Wife, Sitt'st at the right hand of the Lord of Life, Who, of all bounty, craves for only fee The glory of hearing it besought with smiles by thee! Ora pro me! Mother, who lead'st me still by unknown ways, Giving the gifts I know not how to ask, Bless thou the work Which, done, redeems my many wasted days, Makes white the murk, And crowns the few which thou wilt not dispraise, When clear my Songs of Lady's graces rang, And little guess'd I 'twas of thee I sang! Vainly, till now, my pray'rs would thee compel To fire my verse with thy shy fame, too long Shunning world-blazon of well-ponder'd song; But doubtful smiles, at last, 'mid thy denials lurk; From which I spell, ‘Humility and greatness grace the task Which he who does it deems impossible!’ XVIII DEAD LANGUAGE ‘Thou dost not wisely, Bard. A double voice is Truth's, to use at will: One, with the abysmal scorn of good for ill, Smiting the brutish ear with doctrine hard, Wherein She strives to look as near a lie As can comport with her divinity; The other tender-soft as seem The embraces of a dead Love in a dream. These thoughts, which you have sung In the vernacular, Should be, as others of the Church's are, Decently cloak'd in the Imperial Tongue. Have you no fears Lest, as Lord Jesus bids your sort to dread, Yon acorn-munchers rend you limb from limb, You, with Heaven's liberty affronting theirs!’ So spoke my monitor; but I to him, ‘Alas, and is not mine a language dead?’ AMELIA, TAMERTON CHURCH-TOWER, ETC. AMELIA Whene'er mine eyes do my Amelia greet It is with such emotion As when, in childhood, turning a dim street, I first beheld the ocean. There, where the little, bright, surf-breathing town, That shew'd me first her beauty and the sea, Gathers its skirts against the gorse-lit down And scatters gardens o'er the southern lea, Abides this Maid Within a kind, yet sombre Mother's shade, Who of her daughter's graces seems almost afraid, Viewing them ofttimes with a scared forecast, Caught, haply, from obscure love-peril past. Howe'er that be, She scants me of my right, Is cunning careful evermore to balk Sweet separate talk, And fevers my delight By frets, if, on Amelia's cheek of peach, I touch the notes which music cannot reach, Bidding ‘Good-night!’ Wherefore it came that, till to-day's dear date, I curs'd the weary months which yet I have to wait Ere I find heaven, one-nested with my mate. To-day, the Mother gave, To urgent pleas and promise to behave As she were there, her long-besought consent To trust Amelia with me to the grave Where lay my once-betrothed, Millicent: ‘For,’ said she, hiding ill a moistening eye, ‘Though, Sir, the word sounds hard, God makes as if He least knew how to guard The treasure He loves best, simplicity.’ And there Amelia stood, for fairness shewn Like a young apple-tree, in flush'd array Of white and ruddy flow'r, auroral, gay, With chilly blue the maiden branch between; And yet to look on her moved less the mind To say ‘How beauteous!’ than ‘How good and kind!’ And so we went alone By walls o'er which the lilac's numerous plume Shook down perfume; Trim plots close blown With daisies, in conspicuous myriads seen, Engross'd each one With single ardour for her spouse, the sun; Garths in their glad array Of white and ruddy branch, auroral, gay, With azure chill the maiden flow'r between; Meadows of fervid green, With sometime sudden prospect of untold Cowslips, like chance-found gold; And broadcast buttercups at joyful gaze, Rending the air with praise, Like the six-hundred-thousand-voiced shout Of Jacob camp'd in Midian put to rout; Then through the Park, Where Spring to livelier gloom Quicken'd the cedars dark, And, 'gainst the clear sky cold, Which shone afar Crowded with sunny alps oracular, Great chestnuts raised themselves abroad like cliffs of bloom; And everywhere, Amid the ceaseless rapture of the lark, With wonder new We caught the solemn voice of single air, ‘Cuckoo!’ And when Amelia, 'bolden'd, saw and heard How bravely sang the bird, And all things in God's bounty did rejoice, She who, her Mother by, spake seldom word, Did her charm'd silence doff, And, to my happy marvel, her dear voice Went as a clock does, when the pendulum's off. Ill Monarch of man's heart the Maiden who Does not aspire to be High-Pontiff too! So she repeated soft her Poet's line, ‘By grace divine, Not otherwise, O Nature, are we thine!’ And I, up the bright steep she led me, trod, And the like thought pursued With, ‘What is gladness without gratitude, And where is gratitude without a God?’ And of delight, the guerdon of His laws, She spake, in learned mood; And I, of Him loved reverently, as Cause, Her sweetly, as Occasion of all good. Nor were we shy, For souls in heaven that be May talk of heaven without hypocrisy. And now, when we drew near The low, gray Church, in its sequester'd dell, A shade upon me fell. Dead Millicent indeed had been most sweet, But I how little meet To call such graces in a Maiden mine! A boy's proud passion free affection blunts; His well-meant flatteries oft are blind affronts; And many a tear Was Millicent's before I, manlier, knew That maidens shine As diamonds do, Which, though most clear, Are not to be seen through; And, if she put her virgin self aside And sate her, crownless, at my conquering feet, It should have bred in me humility, not pride. Amelia had more luck than Millicent: Secure she smiled and warm from all mischance Or from my knowledge or my ignorance, And glow'd content With my—some might have thought too much—superior age, Which seem'd the gage Of steady kindness all on her intent. Thus nought forbade us to be fully blent. While, therefore, now Her pensive footstep stirr'd The darnell'd garden of unheedful death, She ask'd what Millicent was like, and heard Of eyes like her's, and honeysuckle breath, And of a wiser than a woman's brow, Yet fill'd with only woman's love, and how An incidental greatness character'd Her unconsider'd ways. But all my praise Amelia thought too slight for Millicent, And on my lovelier-freighted arm she leant, For more attent; And the tea-rose I gave, To deck her breast, she dropp'd upon the grave. ‘And this was her's,’ said I, decoring with a band Of mildest pearls Amelia's milder hand. ‘Nay, I will wear it for her sake,’ she said: For dear to maidens are their rivals dead. And so, She seated on the black yew's tortured root, I on the carpet of sere shreds below, And nigh the little mound where lay that other, I kiss'd her lips three times without dispute, And, with bold worship suddenly aglow, I lifted to my lips a sandall'd foot, And kiss'd it three times thrice without dispute. Upon my head her fingers fell like snow, Her lamb-like hands about my neck she wreathed. Her arms like slumber o'er my shoulders crept, And with her bosom, whence the azalea breathed, She did my face full favourably smother, To hide the heaving secret that she wept! Now would I keep my promise to her Mother; Now I arose, and raised her to her feet, My best Amelia, fresh-born from a kiss, Moth-like, full-blown in birthdew shuddering sweet, With great, kind eyes, in whose brown shade Bright Venus and her Baby play'd! At inmost heart well pleased with one another, What time the slant sun low Through the plough'd field does each clod sharply shew, And softly fills With shade the dimples of our homeward hills, With little said, We left the 'wilder'd garden of the dead, And gain'd the gorse-lit shoulder of the down That keeps the north-wind from the nestling town, And caught, once more, the vision of the wave, Where, on the horizon's dip, A many-sailed ship Pursued alone her distant purpose grave; And, by steep steps rock-hewn, to the dim street I led her sacred feet; And so the Daughter gave, Soft, moth-like, sweet, Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk, Back to her Mother, anxious in the dusk. And now ‘Good-night!’ Me shall the phantom months no more affright For heaven's gates to open well waits he Who keeps himself the key. L'ALLEGRO Felicity! Who ope'st to none that knocks, yet, laughing weak, Yield'st all to Love that will not seek, And who, though won, wilt droop and die, Unless wide doors bespeak thee free, How safe's the bond of thee and me, Since thee I cherish and defy! Is't Love or Friendship, Dearest, we obey? Ah, thou art young, and I am gray; But happy man is he who knows How well time goes, With no unkind intruder by, Between such friends as thou and I! 'Twould wrong thy favour, Sweet, were I to say, 'Tis best by far, When best things are not possible, To make the best of those that are; For, though it be not May, Sure, few delights of Spring excel The beauty of this mild September day! So with me walk, And view the dreaming field and bossy Autumn wood, And how in humble russet goes The Spouse of Honour, fair Repose, Far from a world whence love is fled And truth is dying because joy is dead; And, if we hear the roaring wheel Of God's remoter service, public zeal, Let us to stiller place retire And glad admire How, near Him, sounds of working cease In little fervour and much peace; And let us talk Of holy things in happy mood, Learnt of thy blest twin-sister, Certitude; Or let's about our neighbours chat, Well praising this, less praising that, And judging outer strangers by Those gentle and unsanction'd lines To which remorse of equity Of old hath moved the School divines. Or linger where this willow bends, And let us, till the melody be caught, Harken that sudden, singing thought, On which unguess'd increase to life perchance depends. He ne'er hears twice the same who hears The songs of heaven's unanimous spheres, And this may be the song to make, at last, amends For many sighs and boons in vain long sought! Now, careless, let us stray, or stop To see the partridge from the covey drop, Or, while the evening air's like yellow wine, From the pure stream take out The playful trout, That jerks with rasping check the struggled line; Or to the Farm, where, high on trampled stacks, The labourers stir themselves amain To feed with hasty sheaves of grain The deaf'ning engine's boisterous maw, And snatch again, From to-and-fro tormenting racks, The toss'd and hustled straw; Whilst others tend the shedded wheat That fills yon row of shuddering sacks, Or shift them quick, and bind them neat, And dogs and boys with sticks Wait, murderous, for the rats that leave the ruin'd ricks; And, all the bags being fill'd and rank'd fivefold, they pour The treasure on the barn's clean floor, And take them back for more, Until the whole bared harvest beauteous lies Under our pleased and prosperous eyes. Then let us give our idlest hour To the world's wisdom and its power; Hear famous Golden-Tongue refuse To gander sauce that's good for goose, Or the great Clever Party con How many grains of sifted sand, Heap'd, make a likely house to stand, How many fools one Solomon. Science, beyond all other lust Endow'd with appetite for dust, We glance at where it grunts, well-sty'd, And pass upon the other side. Pass also by, in pensive mood, Taught by thy kind twin-sister, Certitude, Yon puzzled crowd, whose tired intent Hunts like a pack without a scent. And now come home, Where none of our mild days Can fail, though simple, to confess The magic of mysteriousness; For there 'bide charming Wonders three, Besides, Sweet, thee, To comprehend whose commonest ways, Ev'n could that be, Were coward's 'vantage and no true man's praise. TAMERTON CHURCH-TOWER; OR, FIRST LOVE I 1 We left the Church at Tamerton In gloomy western air; To greet the day we gallop'd on, A merry-minded pair. The hazy East hot noon did bode; Our horses sniff'd the dawn; We made ten Cornish miles of road Before the dew was gone. We clomb the hill where Lanson's Keep Fronts Dartmoor's distant ridge; Thence trotted South; walk'd down the steep That slants to Gresson Bridge; And paused awhile, where Tamar waits, In many a shining coil, And teeming Devon separates From Cornwall's sorry soil. 2 Our English skies contain'd, that Spring, A Caribbean sun; The singing birds forgot to sing, The rivulets to run. For three noons past, the skies had frown'd, Obscured with blighting shades That only mock'd the thirsty ground And unrejoicing glades. To-day, before the noon was nigh, Bright-skirted vapours grew, And on the sky hung languidly; The sky was languid too. Our horses dropp'd their necks, and nosed The dusty wayside grass, Whilst we beneath still boughs reposed And watch'd the water pass. We spoke of plighted Bertha: Frank Shot pebbles in the stream; And I lay by him on the bank, But dreamt no lover's dream. She was a blythe and bashful maid, Much blushing in her glee; Yet gracing all she did and said With sweet sufficiency. ‘Is Blanche as fair?’ ask'd I, who yearn'd To feel my life complete; To taste unselfish pleasures earn'd By service strict and sweet. ‘Well, some say fairer: she'll surprise Your heart with crimson lips; Fat underlids, that hold bright eyes In laughing half-eclipse; Alluring locks, done up with taste Behind her dainty ears; And manners full of wayward haste, Tho' facile as the deer's.’ 3 ‘You paint a leaflet, here and there; And not the blossom: tell What mysteries of good and fair These blazon'd letters spell.’ 4 ‘Her mouth and teeth, by Cupid's bow! Are letters spelling “kiss;” And, witchingly withdrawn below Twin worlds of baby-bliss, Her waist, so soft and small, may mean, “O, when will some one come To make me catch my breath between His finger and his thumb!”’ 5 My life, 'twas like a land of dreams, Where nothing noble throve: Dull seem'd it as to maiden seems The verse that's not of love. ‘See where,’ sigh'd I, ‘the water dim Repeats, with leaden hue, The fervid sun, the cloud's hot rim, The gap of dazzling blue!’ Quoth Frank, ‘I do, and hence foresee And all too plainly scan Some sentimental homily On Duty, Death, or Man.’ ‘'Tis this;’ said I, ‘our senses mar, Ev'n so, sweet Nature's face, Unless by love revived they are, Or lit by heavenly grace. Below the hazel talks the rill; My heart speaks not again; The solemn cloud, the stately hill, I look on each in vain. Sure he for whom no Power shall strike This darkness into day—’ ‘Is damn'd,’ said Frank, who morall'd like The Fool in an old Play. ‘That's true!’ cried I, ‘yet, as the worm That sickens ere it change—’ ‘Or as the pup that nears the term At which pups have the mange— Pooh! Come, Man, let us on,’ he said, ‘For now the storm is nigh!’ And whilst we rode quaint sense we read Within the changing sky. Above us bent a prophet wild, Pointing to hidden harm; Beyond, a magic woman smiled, And wove some wondrous charm; Past that, a censer jetted smoke: Black convolutions roll'd Sunwards, and caught the light, and broke In crowns of shining gold. 6 The gaps of blue shrank fast in span; The long-forgotten breeze, By lazy starts and fits, began To stir the higher trees. At noon, we came to Tavistock; And sunshine still was there, But gloomy Dartmoor seem'd to mock Its weak and yellow glare. The swallows, in the wrathful light, Were pitching up and down; A string of rooks made rapid flight, Due southward, o'er the town, Where, baiting at the Tiger-Inn, We talk'd by windows wide, Of Blanche and all my unseen kin, Who did our coming bide. 7 The heavy sign-board swung and shriek'd, In dark air whirl'd the vane, Blinds flapp'd, dust rose, and, straining, creak'd The shaken window-pane; And, just o'erhead, a huge cloud flung, For earnest of its stores, A few calm drops, that struck among The light-leaved sycamores. Hot to be gone, Frank rose and eyed Dark cloud and swinging branch; But less long'd he to greet his Bride Than I to look on Blanche. Her name, pair'd still with praise at home, Would make my pulses start; The hills between us were become A weight upon my heart. ‘Behold,’ I cried, ‘the storm comes not; The northern heavens grow fair.’ ‘Look South,’ said Frank, ‘'tis one wide blot Of thunder-threatening air.’ The string of rooks had travell'd on, Against the southern shroud, And, like some snaky skeleton, Lay twisted in the cloud. ‘No storm to-day!’ said I, ‘for, see, Yon black thing travels south.’ We follow'd soon; our spirits free, Our bodies slaked from drouth. I rode in silence; Frank, with tongue Made lax by too much port, Soliloquising, said or sung After this tipsy sort: ‘Yea, nerves they are the Devil's mesh, And pups begin quite blind, And health is ofttimes in the flesh, And measles in the mind! ‘Foolish and fair was Joan without; Foolish and foul within; High as a hunted pig his snout, She carried a foolish chin. ‘The Boy beheld, and brisk rose he At this badly painted fly: That boys less wise than fish will be Makes many a man to sigh.’ 8 On, on we toil'd, amidst the blaze From Dartmoor's ridges bare; Beneath the hush'd and scorching haze, And through the twinkling air; Along the endless mountain-side, That seem'd with us to move; Past dreary mine-mouths, far and wide; Huge dross-heap, wheel, and groove; Dark towns by disembowell'd hills, Where swarthy tribes abode, Who, in hard rocks with harder wills, Pursued the crooked lode; Up heights, that seem'd against us match'd; Until, from table-land, Before the teasing midge was hatch'd, We hail'd the southern strand. Then pleasantly, on level ground And through the lighter air, We paced along and breathed around, A merry-minded pair. A western night of even cloud Suck'd in the sultry disk; Bright racks look'd on, a fiery crowd, To seamen boding risk; The late crow wing'd his silent way Across the shadowy East; The gnat danced out his little day, His ceaseless singing ceased; Along the dim horizon round Fled faint electric fires; Blue glow-worms lit the fresher ground By moisture-harbouring briers; Far northward twinkled lonely lights, The peopled vales among; In front, between the gaping heights, The mystic ocean hung. 9 Our weary spirits flagg'd beneath The still and loaded air; We left behind the freër heath, A moody-minded pair. With senses slack and sick of mirth, Tho' near the happy goal, I murmur'd, fearing nought on earth Could quite content the soul: ‘Suppose your love prove such a light As yonder glow-worm's lamp, That gleams, at distance, strong and bright, Approach'd, burns weak and damp. Perchance, by much of bliss aroused, Your heart will pant for more; And then the worm of want lies housed Within the sweet fruit's core! Far worse, if, led by fancy blind, But undeceiv'd by use—’ ‘I dream,’ yawn'd Frank, ‘and wake to find My Goddess a green goose!’ ‘Vain, vain,’ said I, ‘is worldly weal: We faint, within the heart, For good which all we see and feel Foreshadows but in part.’ Frank answer'd, ‘What you faint for, win! Faint not, but forward press. Heav'n proffers all: 'twere grievous sin To live content in less. The Sun rolls by us every day; And it and all things speak To the sinking heart of man, and say, 'Tis wicked to be weak. We would not hear the hated sound; But, by the Lord, we must: If not, the heavy world goes round, And grinds us into dust.’ With each a moral in his mouth, We rein'd our sweating nags, Where quiet Ocean, on the South, Kiss'd Edgecumb's ruddy crags. II 1 So subtly love within me wrought, So excellent she seem'd, Daily of Blanche was all my thought, Nightly of Blanche I dream'd; And this was all my wish, and all The work now left for life, To make this Wonder mine, to call This laughing Blanche my Wife. 2 I courted her till hope grew bold; Then sought her in her place, And all my passion freely told, Before her blushing face. I kiss'd her twice, I kiss'd her thrice, Thro' tresses and thro' tears; I kiss'd her lips, I kiss'd her eyes, And calm'd her joys and fears. So woo'd I Blanche, and so I sped, And so, with small delay, I and the patient Frank were wed Upon the self-same day. And friends all round kiss'd either Bride, I Frank's, Frank mine; and he Laugh'd as for once we thus defied Love's sweet monopoly. And then we drove by garth and grove; And soon forgot the place Where all the world had look'd shy Love So rudely in the face. III 1 The noon was hot and close and still, When, steadying Blanche's hand, I led her down the southern hill, And row'd with her from land. Ere summer's prime that year the wasp Lay gorged within the peach; The tide, as though the sea did gasp, Fell lax upon the beach. Quietly dipp'd the dripping scull, And all beside was calm; But o'er the strange and weary lull No angel waved his palm. The sun was rayless, pale the sky, The distance thick with light: We glided past the fort and by The war-ship's sleeping might. Her paddle stirr'd: without a breeze, A mimic tempest boil'd: The sailors on the silent seas With storm-tuned voices toil'd. I could not toil; I seldom pray'd: What was to do or ask? Love's purple glory round me play'd, Unfed by prayer or task. All perfect my contentment was, For Blanche was all my care; And heaven seem'd only heaven because My goddess would be there. No wafted breeze the ships did strike, No wish unwon moved me; The peace within my soul was like The peace upon the sea. At times, when action sleeps, unstirr'd By any motive gale, A mystic wind, with warning heard, Ruffles life's idle sail. The fancy, then, a fear divines, And, borne on gloomy wings, Sees threats and formidable signs In simply natural things. It smote my heart, how, yesternight, The moon rose in eclipse, And how her maim'd and shapeless light O'erhung the senseless ships. The passion pass'd, as, lightning-lit, Red cloud-scenes shew and close; And soon came wonder at the fit, And smiles and full repose. Again I turn'd me, all devote, To my sweet Idol's shrine; Again I gazed where, on the boat, Her shadow mix'd with mine. 2 Cried Frank, who, with his Wife, was there, ‘We dream! sing each a song.’ And he sang first an old, brave air, And pull'd the boat along: ‘Sir Pelles woo'd, in scorn's despite; He cherish'd love's sweet smart; Ettarde proved light; then, like a Knight, He turn'd her from his heart. ‘O, the remorse with which we pay For duties done too well! But conscience gay does grief allay; As all true knights can tell.’ 3 ‘Alas, poor Knight!’ cried Blanche, ‘Nay, hear,’ Said Frank, ‘the saddest half!’ And drearily he troll'd, while clear Rose Blanche's puzzled laugh. ‘Sir Lob was drunk; the stars were bright. Within an empty ditch, Sir Lob all night lay right and tight As a Saint within his niche. ‘Now, well, quoth he, goes life with me; I've liquor and to spare; I hate the herd that vulgar be; And, O, the stars are fair! ‘The mill-dam burst: Sir Lob lay sunk In that celestial swound: The mill-stream found the knight dead drunk, And the Jury found him drown'd.’ 4 ‘The tunes are good; the words,’ said I, ‘Are hard to understand.’ And soon I prefaced with a sigh This pagan love-song grand: ‘When Love's bright Ichor fills the veins, Love's Amaranth lights the brow, The Past grows dark, the Future wanes, Before the golden Now. ‘Marc Antony the war-flags furl'd, For Egypt's Queen said, “Stay:” He reck'd not of the worthless world, Well lost by that delay. ‘Quoth Antony, Here set I up My everlasting rest: Leave me to drain Joy's magic cup, To dream on Egypt's breast.’ 5 Frank smiled, and said my note was wrong; 'Twas neither Man's nor Boy's; And Blanche sang next, some modern song, Of ‘Flowers’ and ‘Fairy Joys.’ As bright disparted skies that break To let a cherub through, So seem'd her mouth: my sight did ache, Glitt'ring with fiery dew; And, in the laugh of her brown eye, My heart, contented so, Lay like the honey-thirsty fly Drows'd in the cactus' glow. Nor heeded I what sang my Saint, Such magic had the sound. The myrtle in her breath made faint The air that hearken'd round. 6 ‘Now, Wife,’ said Frank, ‘to shame our lays, Try you in turn your power; And sing your little song in praise Of Love's selectest flower.’ Her hand felt his: thus sang she then, Submitted to his rule, Tho' shyer than the water-hen On Tamar's shadiest pool. ‘The Myrtle sates with scent the air That flows by Grecian hills; Its fervid leaflets glisten fair By warm Italian rills. The North too has its Lover's-Flower, The glad Forget-me-not; Too bold thro' sunshine, wind, and shower, Too blue to be forgot.’ 7 Pointing far East, Frank said, ‘Do you see Yon porpoise-droves at play?’ We gazed, and saw, with failing glee, Bright lines of spotted spray. Once more the boded terror shook My heart, and made me dumb. ‘To land! to land!’ cried Frank, ‘for, look, The storm, at last, is come!’ Above us, heated fields of mist Precipitated cloud; For shore we pull'd; the swift keel hiss'd; Above us grew the shroud. The pale gull flapp'd the stagnant air; The thunder-drop fell straight; The first wind lifted Blanche's hair; Looking to me she sate. Across the boundless mirror crept, In dark'ning blasts, the squall; And round our terror lightly leapt Mad wavelets, many and small. The oars cast by, convuls'd outflew Our perilous hope the sail. None spoke; all watch'd the waves, that grew Under the splashing hail. With urgent hearts and useless hands, We sate and saw them rise, Coursing to shore in gloomy bands, Below the appalling skies. The wrathful thunder scared the deeps, And where, upon our wake, The sea got up in ghastly heaps, White lines of lightning strake. On, on, with fainting hope we fled, Hard-hunted by the grave; Slow seem'd it, though like wind we sped Over the shouldering wave; In front swift rose the crags, where still A storm of sunshine pour'd; At last, beneath the southern hill, The pitiless breakers roar'd. O, bolt foreseen before it burst! O, chastening hard to bear! O, cup of sweetness quite revers'd, And turn'd to void despair! Blanche in fear swooning, I let go The helm; we struck the ground; The sea fell in from stern to prow, And Blanche, my Bride, was drown'd. What guilt was hers? But God is great, And all that may be known To each of any other's fate Is, that it helps his own. IV 1 In a swift vortex go the years, Each swifter than the last, And seasons four their set careers Pursued, and somehow pass'd. The spirit of Spring, this year, was quench'd With clouds and wind and rain; All night the gust-blown torrent drench'd The gloomy window-pane; Against the pane the flapping blind Flapp'd ever, dismally; And ever, above the rain and wind, Sounded the dismal sea. The billows, like some guilty crew Devour'd by vain remorse, Dash'd up the beach, sighing withdrew, And mix'd, with murmurs hoarse. The morning was a cheerless sight, Amongst the turbid skies; But sweet was the relief of light Within my restless eyes; For then I rose to prayer and toil, Forgat the ocean's moan, Or faced the dizzy crash and coil That drown'd its mournfuller tone. But never, when the tide drew back, Trod I the weltering strand; For horribly my single track Pursued me in the sand. 2 One morn I watch'd the rain subside; And then fared singly forth, Below the clouds, till eve to ride From Edgecumb to the North. Once, only once, I paused upon The sea-transcending height, And turn'd to gaze: far breakers shone, Slow gleams of silent light. Into my horse I struck the spur; Sad was the soul in me; Sore were my lids with tears for her Who slept beneath the sea. But soon I sooth'd my startled horse, And check'd that sudden grief, And look'd abroad on crag and gorse And Dartmoor's cloudy reef. Far forth the air was dark and clear, The crags acute and large, The clouds uneven, black, and near, And ragged at the marge. The spider, in his rainy mesh, Shook not, but, as I rode, The opposing air, sweet, sharp, and fresh, Against my hot lids flow'd. Peat-cutters pass'd me, carrying tools; Hawks glimmer'd on the wing; The ground was glad with grassy pools, And brooklets galloping; And sparrows chirp'd, with feathers spread, And dipp'd and drank their fill, Where, down its sandy channel, fled The lessening road-side rill. 3 I cross'd the furze-grown table-land, And near'd the northern vales, That lay perspicuously plann'd In lesser hills and dales. Then rearward, in a slow review, Fell Dartmoor's jagged lines; Around were dross-heaps, red and blue, Old shafts of gutted mines, Impetuous currents copper-stain'd, Wheels stream-urged with a roar, Sluice-guiding grooves, strong works that strain'd With freight of upheaved ore. And then, the train, with shock on shock, Swift rush and birth-scream dire, Grew from the bosom of the rock, And pass'd in noise and fire. With brazen throb, with vital stroke, It went, far heard, far seen, Setting a track of shining smoke Against the pastoral green. Then, bright drops, lodged in budding trees, Were loos'd in sudden showers, Touch'd by the novel western breeze, Friend of the backward flowers. Then rose the Church at Tavistock, The rain still falling there; But sunny Dartmoor seem'd to mock The gloom with cheerful glare. About the West the gilt vane reel'd And pois'd; and, with sweet art, The sudden, jangling changes peal'd Until, around my heart, Conceits of brighter times, of times The brighter for past storms, Clung thick as bees, when brazen chimes Call down the hiveless swarms. 4 I rested at the Tiger Inn, There half-way on my ride, And mused with joy of friends and kin Who did my coming bide. The Vicar, in his sombre wear That shone about the knees, Before me stood, his aspect fair With godly memories. I heard again his kind ‘Good-bye: Christ speed and keep thee still From frantic passions, for they die And leave a frantic will.’ My fond, old Tutor, learn'd and meek! A soul, in strangest truth, As wide as Asia and as weak; Not like his daughter Ruth. A Girl of fullest heart she was; Her spirit's lovely flame Nor dazzled nor surprised, because It always burn'd the same; And in the maiden path she trod Fair was the wife foreshown, A Mary in the house of God, A Martha in her own. Charms for the sight she had; but these Were tranquil, grave, and chaste, And all too beautiful to please A rash, untutor'd taste. 5 In love with home, I rose and eyed The rainy North; but there The distant hill-top, in its pride, Adorn'd the brilliant air: And, as I pass'd from Tavistock, The scatter'd dwellings white, The Church, the golden weather-cock, Were whelm'd in happy light; The children 'gan the sun to greet, With song and senseless shout; The lambs to skip, their dams to bleat; In Tavy leapt the trout; Across a fleeting eastern cloud, The splendid rainbow sprang, And larks, invisible and loud, Within its zenith sang. 6 So lay the Earth that saw the skies Grow clear and bright above, As the repentant spirit lies In God's forgiving love. The lark forsook the waning day, And all loud songs did cease; The Robin, from a wither'd spray, Sang like a soul at peace. Far to the South, in sunset glow'd The peaks of Dartmoor ridge, And Tamar, full and tranquil, flow'd Beneath the Gresson Bridge. There, conscious of the numerous noise Of rain-awaken'd rills, And gathering deep and sober joys From the heart-enlarging hills, I sat, until the first white star Appear'd, with dewy rays, And the fair moon began to bar With shadows all the ways. O, well is thee, whate'er thou art, And happy shalt thou be, If thou hast known, within thy heart, The peace that came to me. O, well is thee, if aught shall win Thy spirit to confess, God proffers all, 'twere grievous sin To live content in less! 7 I mounted, now, my patient nag; And scaled the easy steep; And soon beheld the quiet flag On Lanson's solemn Keep. And now, whenas the waking lights Bespake the valley'd Town, A child o'ertook me, on the heights, In cap and russet gown. It was an alms-taught scholar trim, Who, on her happy way, Sang to herself the morrow's hymn; For this was Saturday. ‘Saint Stephen, stoned, nor grieved nor groan'd: 'Twas all for his good gain; For Christ him blest, till he confess'd A sweet content in pain. ‘Then Christ His cross is no way loss, But even a present boon: Of His dear blood fair shines a flood On heaven's eternal noon.’ 8 My sight, once more, was dim for her Who slept beneath the sea, As on I sped, without the spur, By homestead, heath, and lea. Beside my path the moon kept pace, In meek and brilliant power, And lit, ere long, the eastern face Of Tamerton Church-tower. THE YEW-BERRY 1 I call this idle history the ‘Berry of the Yew; Because there's nothing sweeter than its husk of scarlet glue, And nothing half so bitter as its black core bitten through. I loved, saw hope, and said so; learn'd that Laura loved again: Why speak of joy then suffer'd? My head throbs, and I would fain Find words to lay the spectre starting now before my brain. She loved me: all things told it; eye to eye, and palm to palm: As the pause upon the ceasing of a thousand-voiced psalm Was the mighty satisfaction and the full eternal calm. On her face, when she was laughing, was the seriousness within; Her sweetest smiles, (and sweeter did a lover never win,) In passing, grew so absent that they made her fair cheek thin. On her face, when she was speaking, thoughts unworded used to live; So that when she whisper'd to me, ‘Better joy Earth cannot give,’ Her following silence added, ‘But Earth's joy is fugitive.’ For there a nameless something, though suppress'd, still spread around; The same was on her eyelids, if she look'd towards the ground; In her laughing, singing, talking, still the same was in the sound;— A sweet dissatisfaction, which at no time went away, But shadow'd on her spirit, even at its brightest play, That her mirth was like the sunshine in the closing of the day. 2 Let none ask joy the highest, save those who would have it end: There's weight in earthly blessings; they are earthy, and they tend, By predetermin'd impulse, at their highest, to descend. I still for a happy season, in the present, saw the past, Mistaking one for the other, feeling sure my hold was fast On that of which the symbols vanish'd daily: but, at last, As when we watch bright cloud-banks round about the low sun ranged, We suddenly remember some rich glory gone or changed, All at once I comprehended that her love was grown estranged. From this time, spectral glimpses of a darker fear came on: They came; but, since I scorn'd them, were no sooner come than gone.— At times, some gap in sequence frees the spirit, and, anon, We remember states of living ended ere we left the womb, And see a vague aurora flashing to us from the tomb, The dreamy light of new states, dash'd tremendously with gloom. We tremble for an instant, and a single instant more Brings absolute oblivion, and we pass on as before! Ev'n so those dreadful glimpses came, and startled, and were o'er. 3 One morning, one bright morning, Wortley met me. He and I, As we rode across the country, met a friend of his. His eye Caught Wortley's, who rode past him. ‘What,’ said he, ‘pass old friends by? So I've heard your game is grounded! Why your life's one long romance After your last French fashion. But, ah! ha! should Herbert chance—’ ‘Nay, Herbert's here,’ said he, and introduced me, with a glance Of easy smiles, ignoring this embarrassment; and then This pass'd off, and soon after I went home, and took a pen, And wrote the signs here written, with much more, and where, and when; And, having read them over once or twice, sat down to think, From time to time beneath them writing more, till, link by link, The evidence against her was fulfill'd: I did not shrink, But I read them all together, and I found it was no dream. What I felt I can't remember; an oblivion which the gleam Of light which oft comes through it shews for blessedness extreme. At last I moved, exclaiming, ‘I will not believe, until ‘I've spoken once with Laura.’ Thereon all my heart grew still: For doubt and faith are active, and decisions of the will. 4 I found my Love. She started: I suppose that I was pale. We talk'd; but words on both sides, seem'd to sicken, flag, and fail. Then I gave her what I'd written, watching whether she would quail. In and out flew sultry blushes: so, when red reflections rise From conflagrations, filling the alarm'd heart with surmise, They lighten now, now darken, up and down the gloomy skies. She finish'd once; but fearing to look from it, read it o'er Ten times at least. Poor Laura, had those readings been ten score, That refuge from confusion had confused thee more and more! I said, ‘You're ill, sit Laura,’ and she sat down and was meek. ‘Ah tears! not lost to God then. But pray Laura, do not speak: I understand you better by the moisture on your cheek.’ She shook with sobs, in silence. I yet checking passion's sway, Said only, ‘Farewell Laura!’ then got up, and strode away; For I felt that she would burst my heart asunder should I stay. Oh, ghastly corpse of Love so slain! it makes the world its hearse; Or, as the sun extinct and dead, after the doomsday curse, It rolls, an unseen danger, through the darken'd universe. I struggled to forget this; but, forgetfulness too sweet! It startled with its sweetness, thus involv'd its own defeat; And, every time this happen'd, aching memory would repeat The shock of that discovery: so at length I learn'd by heart And never, save when sleeping, suffer'd thenceforth to depart, The feeling of my sorrow: and in time this sooth'd the smart. Yet even now not seldom, in my leisure, in the thick Of other thoughts, unchallenged, words and looks come crowding quick— They do while I am writing, till the sunshine makes me sick. THE RIVER (ÆT. 16) It is a venerable place, An old ancestral ground, So broad, the rainbow wholly stands Within its lordly bound; And here the river waits and winds By many a wooded mound. Upon a rise, where single oaks And clumps of beeches tall Drop pleasantly their shade beneath, Half-hid amidst them all, Stands in its quiet dignity An ancient manor-hall. About its many gable-ends The swallows wheel their flight; The huge fantastic weather-vanes Look happy in the light; The warm front through the foliage gleams, A comfortable sight. The ivied turrets seem to love The low, protected leas; And, though this manor-hall hath seen The snow of centuries, How freshly still it stands amid Its wealth of swelling trees! The leafy summer-time is young; The yearling lambs are strong; The sunlight glances merrily; The trees are full of song; The valley-loving river flows Contentedly along. Look where the merry weather-vanes Veer upon yonder tower: There, amid starry jessamine And clasping passion-flower, The sweetest Maid of all the land Is weeping in her bower. Alas, the lowly Youth she loves Loves her, but fears to sue: He came this morning hurriedly; Then forth her blushes flew! But he talk'd of common things, and so Her eyes are fill'd with dew. Time passes on; the clouds are come; The river, late so bright, Rolls foul and black, and gloomily Makes known across the night, In far-heard plash and weary drench, The passage of its might. The noble Bridegroom counts the hours; The guests are coming fast; (The vanes are creaking drearily Within the dying blast!) The bashful Bride is at his side; And night is here at last. The guests are gay; the minstrels play; 'Tis liker noon than night; From side to side, they toast the Bride, Who blushes ruby light: For one and all within that hall, It is a cheerful sight. But unto one, who stands alone, Among the mists without, Watching the windows, bright with shapes Of king and saint devout, Strangely across the muffled air Pierces the laughter-shout. No sound or sight this solemn night But moves the soul to fear: The faded saints stare through the gloom, Askant, and wan, and blear; And wither'd cheeks of watchful kings Start from their purple gear. The burthen of the wedding-song Comes to him like a wail; The stream, athwart the cedar-grove, Is shining ghastly pale: His cloudy brow clears suddenly! Dark soul, what does thee ail? He turns him from the lighted hall; The pale stream curls and heaves And moans beyond the gloomy wood, Through which he breaks and cleaves; And now his footfall dies away Upon the wither'd leaves. The restless moon, among the clouds, Is loitering slowly by; Now in a circle like the ring About a weeping eye; Now left quite bare and bright; and now A pallor in the sky; And now she's looking through the mist, Cold, lustreless, and wan, And wildly, past her dreary form, The watery clouds rush on, A moment white beneath her light, And then, like spirits, gone. Silent and fast they hurry past, Their swiftness striketh dread, For earth is hush'd, and no breath sweeps The spider's rainy thread, And everything, but those pale clouds, Is dark, and still, and dead. The lonely stars are here and there, But weak and wasting all; The winds are dead, the cedars spread Their branches like a pall; The guests, by laughing twos and threes, Have left the bridal hall. Beneath the mossy, ivied bridge, The river slippeth past: The current deep is still as sleep, And yet so very fast! There's something in its quietness That makes the soul aghast. No wind is in the willow-tree That droops above the bank; The water passes quietly Beneath the sedges dank; Yet the willow trembles in the stream, And the dry reeds talk and clank. The weak stars swoon; the jagged moon Is lost in the cloudy air. No thought of light! save where the wave Sports with a fitful glare. The dumb and dreadful world is full Of darkness and night-mare. The hall-clocks clang; the watch-dog barks. What are his dreams about? Marsh lights leap, and tho' fast asleep The owlets shriek and shout; The stars, thro' chasms in utter black, Race like a drunken rout. ‘Wake, wake, oh wake!’ the Bridegroom now Calls to his sleeping Bride: ‘Alas, I saw thee, pale and dead, Roll down a frightful tide!’ He takes her hand: ‘How chill thou art! What is it, sweet my Bride?’ The Bride bethinks her now of him Who last night was no guest. ‘Sweet Heaven! and for me? I dream! Be calm, thou throbbing breast.’ She says, in thought, a solemn prayer And sinks again to rest. Along, along, swiftly and strong The river slippeth past; The current deep is still as sleep, And yet so very fast! There's something in its quietness That makes the soul aghast. The morn has risen: wildly by The water glides to-day; Outspread upon its eddying face, Long weeds and rushes play; And on the bank the fungus rots, And the grass is foul'd with clay. Time passes on: the park is bare; The year is scant and lean; The river's banks are desolate; The air is chill and keen; But, now and then, a sunny day Comes with a thought of green. Amid blear February's flaw, Tremulous snowdrops peep; The crocus, in the shrewd March morn, Starts from its wintry sleep; The daisies sun themselves in hosts, Among the pasturing sheep. The waters, in their old content, Between fresh margins run; The pike, as trackless as a sound, Shoots thro' the current dun; And languid new-born chestnut-leaves Expand beneath the sun. The summer's prime is come again; The lilies bloom anew; The current keeps the doubtful past Deep in its bosom blue, And babbles low thro' quiet fields Gray with the falling dew. The sheep-bell tolls the curfew-time; The gnats, a busy rout, Fleck the warm air; the distant owl Shouteth a sleepy shout; The voiceless bat, more felt than seen, Is flitting round about; The poplar's leaflet scarcely stirs; The river seems to think; Across the dusk, the lily broad Looks coolly from the brink; And knee-deep in the freshet's fall, The meek-eyed cattle drink. The chafers boom; the white moths rise Like spirits from the ground; The gray-flies sing their weary tune, A distant, dream-like sound; And far, far off, in the slumberous eve, Bayeth a restless hound. At this sweet time, the Lady walks Beside the gentle stream; She marks the waters curl along, Beneath the sunset gleam, And in her soul a sorrow moves, Like memory of a dream. She passes on. How still the earth, And all the air above! Here, where of late the scritch-owl shriek'd, Whispers the happy dove; And the river, through the ivied bridge, Flows calm as household love. THE FALCON Who would not be Sir Hubert, for his birth and bearing fine, His rich sky-skirted woodlands, valleys flowing oil and wine; Sir Hubert, to whose sunning all the rays of fortune shine? So most men praised Sir Hubert, and some others warm'd with praise Of Hubert noble-hearted, than whom none went on his ways Less spoilt by splendid fortune, whom no peril could amaze. To Ladies all, save one, he was the rule by which the worth Of other men was reckon'd; so that many a maid, for dearth Of such a knight to woo her, love forswore, and with it mirth. No prince could match his banquets, when proud Mabel was his guest; And shows and sumptuous triumphs day by day his hope express'd That love e'en yet might burgeon in her young unburgeon'd breast. Time pass'd, and use for riches pass'd with hope, which slowly fled; And want came on unheeded; and report in one day spread Of good Sir Hubert houseless, and of Mabel richly wed. Forth went he from the city where she dwelt, to one poor farm, All left of all his valleys: there Sir Hubert's single arm Served Hubert's wants; and labour soon relieved love's rankling harm. Much hardship brought much easement of the melancholy freight He bore within his bosom; and his fancy was elate And proud of Love's rash sacrifice which led to this estate. One friend was left, a falcon, famed for beauty, skill, and size, Kept from his fortune's ruin, for the sake of its great eyes, That seem'd to him like Mabel's. Of an evening he would rise, And wake its royal glances and reluctantly flapp'd wings, And looks of grave communion with his lightsome questionings, That broke the drowsy sameness, and the sense like fear that springs At night, when we are conscious of our distance from the strife Of cities, and the memory of the spirit in all things rife Endows the silence round us with a grim and ghastly life. His active resignation wrought, in time, a heartfelt peace, And though, in noble bosoms, love once lit can never cease, He could walk and think of Mabel, and his pace would not increase. Who say, when somewhat distanced from the heat and fiercer might, ‘Love's brand burns us no longer; it is out,’ use not their sight: For ever and for ever we are lighted by the light: And ere there be extinguish'd one minutest flame, love-fann'd, The Pyramids of Egypt shall have no place in the land, But as a nameless portion of its ever-shifting sand. News came at last that Mabel was a widow; but, with this, That all her dead Lord's wealth went first to her one child and his; So she was not for Hubert, had she beckon'd him to bliss; For Hubert felt, tho' Mabel might, like him, become resign'd To poverty for Love's sake, she might never, like him, find That poverty is plenty, peace, and freedom of the mind. One morning, while he rested from his delving, spade in hand, He thought of her and blest her, and he look'd about the land, And he, and all he look'd at, seem'd to brighten and expand. The wind was newly risen; and the airy skies were rife With fleets of sailing cloudlets, and the trees were all in strife, Extravagantly triumphant at their newly gotten life. Birds wrangled in the branches, with a trouble of sweet noise; Even the conscious cuckoo, judging wisest to rejoice, Shook round his ‘cuckoo, cuckoo,’ as if careless of his voice. But Hubert mused and marvell'd at the glory in his breast; The first glow turn'd to passion, and he nursed it unexpress'd; And glory gilding glory turn'd, at last, to sunny rest. Then again he look'd around him, like an angel, and, behold, The scene was changed; no cloudlets cross'd the serious blue, but, roll'd Behind the distant hill-tops, gleam'd aërial hills of gold. The wind too was abated, and the trees and birds were grown As quiet as the cloud-banks; right above, the bright sun shone, Down looking from the forehead of the giant sky alone. Then the nightingale, awaken'd by the silence, shot a throng Of notes into the sunshine: cautious first, then swift and strong; Then he madly smote them round him, till the bright air throbb'd with song, And suddenly stopp'd singing, all amid his ecstasies:— Myrtles rustle; what sees Hubert? sight is sceptic, but his knees Bend to the Lady Mabel, as she blossoms from the trees. She spoke, her eyes cast downwards, while upon them, dropp'd half way, Lids fairer than the bosom of an unblown lily lay: ‘In faith of ancient amity, Sir Hubert, I this day ‘Would beg a boon, and bind me your great debtor.’ O, her mouth Was sweet beyond new honey, or the bean-perfumed South, And better than pomegranates to a pilgrim dumb for drouth! She look'd at his poor homestead; at the spade beside his hand; And then her heart reproach'd her, What inordinate demand Was she come there for making! Then she says, in accents bland, Her Page and she are weary, and her wish can wait; she'll share His noontide meal, by his favour. This he hastens to prepare; But, lo! the roost is empty, and his humble larder bare. No friend has he to help him; no one near of whom to claim The tax, and force its payment in his passion's sovereign name; No time to set the pitfalls for the swift and fearful game; Too late to fly his falcon, which, as if it would assist Its master's trouble, perches on his idly proffer'd fist, With busy, dumb caresses, treading up and down his wrist. But now a gleam of comfort and a shadow of dismay Pass o'er the good knight's features; now it seems he would essay The fatness of his falcon, while it flaps both wings for play; Now, lo, the ruthless lover takes it off its trusted stand; Grasps all its frighten'd body with his hard remorseless hand; Puts out its faithful life, and plucks and broils it on the brand. In midst of this her dinner, Mabel gave her wish its word: ‘My wilful child, Sir Hubert, pines from fancy long deferr'd; And now he raves in fever to possess your famous bird.’ ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘behold it there.’ Then nobly did she say: ‘It grieves my heart, Sir Hubert, that I'm much too poor to pay For this o'er-queenly banquet I am honour'd with to-day; ‘But if, Sir, we two, henceforth, can converse as friends, my board To you shall be as open as it would were you its Lord.’ And so she bow'd and left him, from his vex'd mind unrestored. Months pass'd, and Hubert went not, but lived on in his old way; Until to him, one morning, Mabel sent her Page to say, That, should it suit his pleasure, she would speak with him that day. ‘Ah, welcome Sir!’ said Mabel, rising courteous, kind and free: ‘I hoped, ere this, to have had you for my guest, but now I see That you are even prouder than they whisper you to be.’ Made grave by her great beauty, but not dazzled, he replied, With every noble courtesy, to her words; and spoke beside Such things as are permitted to bare friendship; not in pride, Or wilful overacting of the right, which often blends Its sacrificial pathos, bitter-sweet, with lover's ends, Or that he now remember'd her command to meet ‘as friends;’ But having not had knowledge that the infant heir was dead, Whose life made it more loving to preserve his love unsaid, He waited, calmly wondering to what mark this summons led. She, puzzled with a strangeness by his actions disavow'd, Spoke further: ‘Once, Sir Hubert, I was thoughtless, therefore proud; Your love on me shone sunlike. I, alas, have been your cloud, ‘And, graceless, quench'd the light that made me splendid. I would fain Pay part of what I owe you, that is, if,—alas, but then I know not! Things are changed, and you are not as other men.’ She strove to give her meaning, yet blush'd deeply with dismay Lest he should find it. Hubert fear'd she purpos'd to repay His love with less than love. Thought he, ‘Sin 'twas my hawk to slay!’ His eyes are dropp'd in sorrow from their worshipping: but, lo! Upon her sable vesture they are fall'n; with progress slow, Through dawning apprehension to sweet hope, his features glow; And all at once are lighted with a light, as when the moon, Long labouring to the margin of a cloud, still seeming soon About to swim beyond it, bursts at last as bare as noon. ‘O, Lady, I have loved, and long kept silence; but I see The time is come for speaking, O, sweet Lady, I should be The blessedest knight in Christendom, were I beloved by thee!’ One small hand's weight of whiteness on her bosom did she press; The other, woo'd with kisses bold, refused not his caress; Feasting the hungry silence came, sob-clad, her silver ‘Yes.’ Now who would not be Hubert, for his dark-eyed Bride divine, Her rich, sky-skirted woodlands, valleys flowing oil and wine, Sir Hubert to whose sunning all the rays of fortune shine!’ THE WOODMAN'S DAUGHTER (ÆT. 16) In Gerald's Cottage by the hill, Old Gerald and his child, Innocent Maud, dwelt happily; He toil'd, and she beguiled The long day at her spinning-wheel, In the garden now grown wild. At Gerald's stroke the jay awoke; Till noon hack follow'd hack, Before the nearest hill had time To give its echo back; And evening mists were in the lane Ere Gerald's arm grew slack. Meanwhile, below the scented heaps Of honeysuckle flower, That made their simple cottage-porch A cool, luxurious bower, Maud sat beside her spinning-wheel, And spun from hour to hour. The growing thread thro' her fingers sped; Round flew the polish'd wheel; Merrily rang the notes she sang At every finish'd reel; From the hill again, like a glad refrain, Follow'd the rapid peal. But all is changed. The rusting axe Reddens a wither'd bough; A spider spins in the spinning-wheel, And Maud sings wildly now; And village gossips say she knows Grief she may not avow. Her secret's this: In the sweet age When heaven's our side the lark, She follow'd her old father, where He work'd from dawn to dark, For months, to thin the crowded groves Of the old manorial Park. She fancied and he felt she help'd; And, whilst he hack'd and saw'd, The rich Squire's son, a young boy then, Whole mornings, as if awed, Stood silent by, and gazed in turn At Gerald and on Maud. And sometimes, in a sullen tone, He offer'd fruits, and she Received them always with an air So unreserved and free, That shame-faced distance soon became Familiarity. Therefore in time, when Gerald shook The woods, no longer coy, The young heir and the cottage-girl Would steal out to enjoy The sound of one another's talk, A simple girl and boy. Spring after Spring, they took their walks Uncheck'd, unquestion'd; yet They learn'd to hide their wanderings By wood and rivulet, Because they could not give themselves A reason why they met. Once Maud came weeping back. ‘Poor Child!’ Was all her father said: And he would steady his old hand Upon her hapless head, And think of her as tranquilly As if the child were dead. But he is gone: and Maud steals out, This gentle day of June; And having sobb'd her pain to sleep, Help'd by the stream's soft tune, She rests along the willow-trunk, Below the calm blue noon. The shadow of her shame and her Deep in the stream, behold! Smiles quake over her parted llps: Some thought has made her bold; She stoops to dip her fingers in, To feel if it be cold. 'Tis soft and warm, and runs as 'twere Perpetually at play: But then the stream, she recollects, Bears everything away. There is a dull pool hard at hand That sleeps both night and day. She marks the closing weeds that shut The water from her sight; They stir awhile, but now are still; Her arms fall down; the light Is horrible, and her countenance Is pale as a cloud at night. Merrily now from the small church-tower Clashes a noisy chime; The larks climb up thro' the heavenly blue, Carolling as they climb: Is it the twisting water-eft That dimples the green slime? The pool reflects the scarlet West With a hot and guilty glow; The East is changing ashy pale; But Maud will never go While those great bubbles struggle up From the rotting weeds below. The light has changed. A little since You scarcely might descry The moon, now gleaming sharp and bright, From the small cloud slumbering nigh; And, one by one, the timid stars Step out into the sky. The night blackens the pool; but Maud Is constant at her post, Sunk in a dread, unnatural sleep, Beneath the skiey host Of drifting mists, thro' which the moon Is riding like a ghost. THE STORM Within the pale blue haze above, Some pitchy shreds took size and form, And, like a madman's wrath or love, From nothing rose a sudden storm. The blossom'd limes, which seem'd to exhale Her breath, were swept with one strong sweep, And up the dusty road the hail Came like a flock of hasty sheep, Driving me under a cottage-porch, Whence I could see the distant Spire, Which, in the darkness, seem'd a torch Touch'd with the sun's retreating fire. A voice, so sweet that even her voice, I thought, could scarcely be more sweet, As thus I stay'd against my choice, Did mine attracted hearing greet; And presently I turn'd my head Where the kind music seem'd to be, And where, to an old blind man, she read The words that teach the blind to see. She did not mark me; swift I went, Thro' the fierce shower's whistle and smoke, To her home, and thence her woman sent Back with umbrella, shoes and cloak. The storm soon pass'd; the sun's quick glare Lay quench'd in vapour fleecy, fray'd; And all the moist, delicious air Was fill'd with shine that cast no shade; And, when she came, forth the sun gleam'd, And clash'd the trembling Minster chimes; And the breath with which she thank'd me seem'd Brought thither from the blossom'd limes. THE BARREN SHORE Full many sing to me and thee Their riches gather'd by the sea; But I will sing, for I'm footsore, The burthen of the barren shore. The hue of love how lively shown In this sole found cerulean stone By twenty leagues of ocean roar. O, burthen of the barren shore! And these few crystal fragments bright, As clear as truth, as strong as right, I found in footing twenty more. O, burthen of the barren shore! And how far did I go for this Small, precious piece of ambergris? Of weary leagues I went threescore. O, burthen of the barren shore! The sand is poor, the sea is rich, And I, I am I know not which; And well it were to know no more The burthen of the barren shore! OLYMPUS Through female subtlety intense, Or the good luck of innocence, Or both, my Wife, with whom I plan To pass calm evenings when I can, After the chattering girls and boys Are gone, or the less grateful noise Is over, of grown tongues that chime Untruly, once upon a time Prevail'd with me to change my mind Of reading out how Rosalind In Arden jested, and to go Where people whom I ought to know, She said, would meet that night. And I, Who inly murmur'd, ‘I will try Some dish more sharply spiced than this Milk-soup men call domestic bliss,’ Took, as she, laughing, bade me take, Our eldest boy's brown wide-awake And straw box of cigars, and went Where, like a careless parliament Of gods olympic, six or eight Authors and else, reputed great, Were met in council jocular On many things, pursuing far Truth, only for the chase's glow, Quick as they caught her letting go, Or, when at fault the view-halloo, Playing about the missing clue. And coarse jests came; ‘But gods are coarse,’ Thought I, yet not without remorse, While memory of the gentle words, Wife, Mother, Sister, flash'd like swords. And so, after two hours of wit, That burnt a hole where'er it hit, I said I would not stay to sup, Because my Wife was sitting up; And walk'd home with a sense that I Was no match for that company. Smelling of smoke, which, always kind, Amelia said she did not mind, I sipp'd her tea, saw Baby scold And finger at the muslin fold, Through which he push'd his nose at last, And choked and chuckled, feeding fast; And, he asleep and sent upstairs, She rang the servants in to prayers; And after heard what men of fame Had urged 'gainst this and that. ‘For shame!’ She said, but argument show'd not. ‘If I had answer'd thus,’ I thought, ‘'Twould not have pass'd for very wise. But I have not her voice and eyes! Howe'er it be, I'm glad of home, Yea, very glad at heart to come And lay a happy head to rest On her unreasonable breast.’ THE ROSY BOSOM'D HOURS A florin to the willing Guard Secured, for half the way, (He lock'd us in, ah, lucky-starr'd,) A curtain'd, front coupé. The sparkling sun of August shone; The wind was in the West; Your gown and all that you had on Was what became you best; And we were in that seldom mood When soul with soul agrees, Mingling, like flood with equal flood, In agitated ease. Far round, each blade of harvest bare Its little load of bread; Each furlong of that journey fair With separate sweetness sped. The calm of use was coming o'er The wonder of our wealth, And now, maybe, 'twas not much more Than Eden's common health. We paced the sunny platform, while The train at Havant changed: What made the people kindly smile, Or stare with looks estranged? Too radiant for a wife you seem'd, Serener than a bride; Me happiest born of men I deem'd, And show'd perchance my pride. I loved that girl, so gaunt and tall, Who whispered loud, ‘Sweet Thing!’ Scanning your figure, slight yet all Round as your own gold ring. At Salisbury you stray'd alone Within the shafted glooms, Whilst I was by the Verger shown The brasses and the tombs. At tea we talk'd of matters deep, Of joy that never dies; We laugh'd, till love was mix'd with sleep Within your great sweet eyes. The next day, sweet with luck no less And sense of sweetness past, The full tide of our happiness Rose higher than the last. At Dawlish, 'mid the pools of brine, You stept from rock to rock, One hand quick tightening upon mine, One holding up your frock. On starfish and on weeds alone You seem'd intent to be: Flash'd those great gleams of hope unknown From you, or from the sea? Ne'er came before, ah, when again Shall come two days like these: Such quick delight within the brain, Within the heart such peace? I thought, indeed, by magic chance, A third from Heaven to win, But as, at dusk, we reach'd Penzance, A drizzling rain set in. THE AFTER-GLOW Suspicion's playful counterfeit Begot your question strange: The only thing that I forget Is that there's any change. Did that long blight which fell on you My zeal of heart assuage? Less willing shall I watch you through The milder illness, age? To my monopoly first blind When risks no longer live, And careless of the hand so kind That has no more to give, Shall I forget Spring like a tree, Nor boast, ‘Her honied cup Of beauty to his lips save me No man has lifted up!’ Mine are not memories that come Of joys that could not last: They are; and you, Dear, are the sum Of all your lovely past. Yet if, with all this conscious weal, I still should covet more, The joy behind me shall reveal The joy that waits before: I'll mind from sickness how to life You came, by tardy stealth, Till, one spring day, I clasp'd my wife Abloom with blandest health. THE GIRL OF ALL PERIODS AN IDYLL ‘And even our women,’ lastly grumbles Ben, ‘Leaving their nature, dress and talk like men!’ A damsel, as our train stops at Five Ashes, Down to the station in a dog-cart dashes. A footman buys her ticket, ‘Third class, parly;’ And, in huge-button'd coat and ‘Champagne Charley’ And such scant manhood else as use allows her, Her two shy knees bound in a single trouser, With, 'twixt her shapely lips, a violet Perch'd as a proxy for a cigarette, She takes her window in our smoking carriage, And scans us, calmly scorning men and marriage. Ben frowns in silence; older, I know better Than to read ladies 'haviour in the letter. This aping man is crafty Love's devising To make the woman's difference more surprising; And, as for feeling wroth at such rebelling, Who'd scold the child for now and then repelling Lures with ‘I won't!’ or for a moment's straying In its sure growth towards more full obeying? ‘Yes, she had read the “Legend of the Ages,” ‘And George Sand too, skipping the wicked pages.’ And, whilst we talk'd, her protest firm and perky Against mankind, I thought, grew lax and jerky; And, at a compliment, her mouth's compressure Nipt in its birth a little laugh of pleasure; And smiles, forbidden her lips, as weakness horrid, Broke, in grave lights, from eyes and chin and forehead; And, as I push'd kind 'vantage 'gainst the scorner, The two shy knees press'd shier to the corner; And Ben began to talk with her, the rather Because he found out that he knew her father, Sir Francis Applegarth, of Fenny Compton, And danced once with her sister Maude at Brompton; And then he stared until he quite confused her, More pleased with her than I, who but excused her; And, when she got out, he, with sheepish glances, Said he'd stop too, and call on old Sir Francis. NIGHT AND SLEEP 1 How strange at night to wake And watch, while others sleep, Till sight and hearing ache For objects that may keep The awful inner sense Unroused, lest it should mark The life that haunts the emptiness And horror of the dark! 2 How strange at night the bay Of dogs, how wild the note Of cocks that scream for day, In homesteads far remote; How strange and wild to hear The old and crumbling tower, Amid the darkness, suddenly Take tongue and speak the hour! 3 Albeit the love-sick brain Affects the dreary moon, Ill things alone refrain From life's nocturnal swoon: Men melancholy mad, Beasts ravenous and sly, The robber, and the murderer, Remorse, with lidless eye. 4 The nightingale is gay, For she can vanquish night; Dreaming, she sings of day Notes that make darkness bright; But when the refluent gloom Saddens the gaps of song, Men charge on her the dolefulness, And call her crazed with wrong. A LONDON FÊTE All night fell hammers, shock on shock; With echoes Newgate's granite clang'd: The scaffold built, at eight o'clock They brought the man out to be hang'd. Then came from all the people there A single cry, that shook the air; Mothers held up their babes to see, Who spread their hands, and crow'd for glee; Here a girl from her vesture tore A rag to wave with, and join'd the roar; There a man, with yelling tired, Stopp'd, and the culprit's crime inquired; A sot, below the doom'd man dumb, Bawl'd his health in the world to come; These blasphemed and fought for places; Those, half-crush'd, cast frantic faces, To windows, where, in freedom sweet, Others enjoy'd the wicked treat. At last, the show's black crisis pended; Struggles for better standings ended; The rabble's lips no longer curst, But stood agape with horrid thirst; Thousands of breasts beat horrid hope; Thousands of eyeballs, lit with hell, Burnt one way all, to see the rope Unslacken as the platform fell. The rope flew tight; and then the roar Burst forth afresh; less loud, but more Confused and affrighting than before. A few harsh tongues for ever led The common din, the chaos of noises, But ear could not catch what they said. As when the realm of the damn'd rejoices At winning a soul to its will, That clatter and clangour of hateful voices Sicken'd and stunn'd the air, until The dangling corpse hung straight and still. The show complete, the pleasure past, The solid masses loosen'd fast: A thief slunk off, with ample spoil, To ply elsewhere his daily toil; A baby strung its doll to a stick; A mother praised the pretty trick; Two children caught and hang'd a cat; Two friends walk'd on, in lively chat; And two, who had disputed places, Went forth to fight, with murderous faces. THE CIRCLES ‘Within yon world-wide cirque of war What's hidden which they fight so for?’ My guide made answer, ‘Rich increase Of virtue and use, which are by peace, And peace by war. That inner ring Are craftsmen, working many a thing For use, and, these within, the wise Explore the grass and read the skies.’ ‘Can the stars’ motions give me peace, Or the herbs' virtues mine increase? Of all this triple shell,’ said I, ‘Would that I might the kernel spy!’ A narrower circle then I reach'd, Where sang a few and many preach'd Of life immortal. ‘But,’ I said, ‘The riddle yet I have not read. Life I must know, that care I may For life in me to last for aye.’ Then he, ‘Those voices are a charm To keep yon dove-cot out of harm.’ In the centre, then, he show'd a tent Where, laughing safe, a woman bent Over her babe, and, her above, Lean'd in his turn a graver love. ‘Behold the two idolatries By which,’ cried he, ‘the world defies Chaos and death, and for whose sake All else must war and work and wake.’ A DREAM Amid the mystic fields of Love I wander'd, and beheld a grove. Breathlessly still was part, and part Was breathing with an easy heart; And there below, in lamblike game, Were virgins, all so much the same, That each was all. A youth drew nigh, And on them gazed with wandering eye, And would have pass'd, but that a maid, Clapping her hands above her, said, ‘My time is now!’ and laughing ran After the dull and strange young man, And bade him stop and look at her. And so he call'd her lovelier Than any else, only because She only then before him was. And, while they stood and gazed, a change Was seen in both, diversely strange: The youth was ever more and more That good which he had been before; But the glad maiden grew and grew Such that the rest no longer knew Their sister, who was now to sight The young man's self, yet opposite, As the outer rainbow is the first, But weaker, and the hues reversed. And whereas, in the abandon'd grove, The virgin round the Central Love Had blindly circled in her play, Now danced she round her partner's way; And, as the earth the moon's, so he Had the responsibility Of her diviner motion. ‘Lo,’ He sang, and the heavens began to glow, ‘The pride of personality, Seeking its highest, aspires to die, And in unspeakably profound Humiliation Love is crown'd! And from his exaltation still Into his ocean of good-will He curiously casts the lead To find strange depths of lowlihead.’ To one same tune, but higher, ‘Bold,’ The maiden sang, ‘is Love! For cold On Earth are blushes, and for shame Of such an ineffectual flame As ill consumes the sacrifice!’ THE YEAR The crocus, while the days are dark, Unfolds its saffron sheen; At April's touch, the crudest bark Discovers gems of green. Then sleep the seasons, full of might; While slowly swells the pod And rounds the peach, and in the night The mushroom bursts the sod. The Winter falls; the frozen rut Is bound with silver bars; The snow-drift heaps against the hut, And night is pierc'd with stars. EROS Bright thro' the valley gallops the brooklet; Over the welkin travels the cloud; Touch'd by the zephyr, dances the harebell; Cuckoo sits somewhere, singing so loud; Two little children, seeing and hearing, Hand in hand wander, shout, laugh, and sing: Lo, in their bosoms, wild with the marvel, Love, like the crocus, is come ere the Spring. Young men and women, noble and tender, Yearn for each other, faith truly plight, Promise to cherish, comfort and honour; Vow that makes duty one with delight. Oh, but the glory, found in no story, Radiance of Eden unquench'd by the Fall; Few may remember, none may reveal it, This the first first-love, the first love of all! MA BELLE Farewell, dear Heart! Since needs it must I go, Dear Heart, farewell! Fain would I stay, but that I love thee so. One kiss, ma Belle! What hope lies in the Land we do not know, Who, Dear, can tell? But thee I love, and let thy 'plaint be, ‘Lo, He loved me well!’ REGINA CŒLI Say, did his sisters wonder what could Joseph see In a mild, silent little Maid like thee? And was it awful, in that narrow house, With God for Babe and Spouse? Nay, like thy simple, female sort, each one Apt to find Him in Husband and in Son, Nothing to thee came strange in this. Thy wonder was but wondrous bliss: Wondrous, for, though True Virgin lives not but does know, (Howbeit none ever yet confess'd,) That God lies really in her breast, Of thine He made His special nest! And so All mothers worship little feet, And kiss the very ground they've trod; But, ah, thy little Baby sweet Who was indeed thy God! KING COPHETUA THE FIRST Said Jove within himself one day, ‘I'll make me a mistress out of clay! These ninefold spheres of chiming quires, Though little things and therefore sweet, Too Godlike are for my desires: My pleasure still is incomplete. The gust of love is mystery, Which poorly yet the heavens supply. Now where may God for mystery seek Save in the earthly, small, and weak? My work, then, let me crown and end With what I ne'er shall comprehend!’ And so the unfathomable Need, Hell's mock, Heaven's pity, was decreed. And, with perversity immense As all his other affluence, Jove left his wondering Court behind And Juno's almost equal mind, On low and little Earth to seek That vessel infinitely weak, (The abler for the infinite honour He hugely long'd to put upon her,) And, in a melancholy grove, Found sighing his predestined Love, A pretty, foolish, pensive maid, The least of heaven-related things, Of every boy and beast afraid, But not of him, the King of Kings. He look'd so measurelessly mild, And so he flatter'd her, poor child, By lifting with respect her hand To his salute benign and grand, That, when he spoke, and begged to be Instructed in her wishes, she, Having a modest minute tarried, Lisp'd, ‘I should like, Sire, to be married.’ But, when he smiling ask'd, ‘Whom to?’ She blush'd and said, she scarcely knew. Then Jove named Shepherds, Lords, and Kings To her free choice; for all such things Were his and his to give; but these She shook her curls at. ‘Hard to please Is my small Cousin, but my nod Shall call from heaven some splendid God—’ ‘Ah, Maker mine, no God will do That's not as great a God as you!’ Thereat Jove laugh'd: ‘As least of things Alone can sate the King of Kings, So the least thing, it seems, that I Alone of Gods can satisfy!’ And, fading in her flushing arms, He blazed for ever from her charms. Thenceforth the maiden sang and shone, Admired by all and woo'd by none, For, though she said she was a sinner, 'Twas clear to all that Jove was in her, And, but for that deep pagan night, She would have been a Carmelite. THE OPEN SECRET The Heavens repeat no other Song, And, plainly or in parable, The Angels trust, in each man's to gue, The Treasure's safety to its size. In shameful Hell The Lily in last corruption lies, Where known 'tis, rotten-lily-wise, By the strange foulness of the smell. Earth, that, in this arcanum, spies Proof of high kinship unconceiv'd, By all desired and disbeliev'd, Shews fancies, in each thing that is, Which nothing mean, not meaning this, Yea, does from her own law, to hint it, err, As 'twere a trust too huge for her. Maiden and Youth pipe wondrous clear The tune they are the last to hear. 'Tis the strange gem in Pleasure's cup. Physician and Philosopher, In search of acorns, plough it up, But count it nothing 'mong their gains, Nay, call it pearl, they'd answer, ‘Lo, Blest Land where pearls as large as pumpkins grow!’ And would not even rend you for your pains. To tell men truth, yet keep them dark And shooting still beside the mark, God, as in jest, gave to their wish, The Sign of Jonah and the Fish. 'Tis the name new, on the white stone, To none but them that have it known; And even these can scarce believe, but cry, ‘When turn'd was Sion's captivity, Then were we, yea, and yet we seem Like them that dream!’ In Spirit 'tis a punctual ray Of peace that sheds more light than day; In Will and Mind 'Tis the easy path so hard to find; In Heart, a pain not to be told, Were words mere honey, milk, and gold; I' the Body 'tis the bag of the bee; In all, the present, thousandfold amends Made to the sad, astonish'd life Of him that leaves house, child, and wife, And on God's 'hest, almost despairing, wends, As little guessing as the herd What a strange Phœnix of a bird Builds in this tree, But only intending all that He intends. To this, the Life of them that live, If God would not, thus far, give tongue, Ah, why did He his secret give To one that has the gift of song? But all He does He doubtless means, And, if the Mystery that smites Prophets dumb Here, to the grace-couch'd eyes of some, Shapes to its living face the clinging shroud, Perchance the Skies grow tired of screens, And 'tis His Advent in the Cloud. THE THREE WITNESSES Musing I met, in no strange land, What meet thou must to understand: An Angel. There was none but he, Yet 'twas a glorious company. God, Youth, and Goddess, one, twain, trine, In altering wedlock flamed benign. The Youth i' the midst did shadowy seem, Till merged in either blest extreme, But could, by choosing, each way turn, And, with God, for the Goddess burn, Or vanish in the Goddess quite, To be, with her, the God's delight; And, whether he chose Hers or His, He glow'd at once with either's bliss. The head was Godhead without guile, A solar force, an infant's smile; Breasted the Wonder was and loin'd With Man and Woman's beauties join'd; And thence, O, moonlike and most sweet, The Goddess brighten'd to the feet, Which, when they felt the one the other, Felt each like Cupid and his Mother. Unwearying, since I caught that sight, Him have I praised by whose word's might The Heavens and the Earth did breathe And the gay Waters underneath. VENUS AND DEATH With fetters gold her captivated feet Lay, sunny sweet; In that palm was the poppy, Sleep; in this The apple, Bliss; Against the mild side of his Spouse and Mother One small God throve, and in't, meseem'd, another. By these a Death-in-Life did foully breathe Out of a face that was one grate of teeth. Lift, O kind Angels, lift her eyelids loth, Lest he devour her and her Godlets both! THE KISS In arms and policy and books Prince Victor was a Prince indeed. Amanda, Princess of sweet looks, Of such things had no heed. But once, both acting in a Play, Victor, who found it in his Part, Gave the cold Maid, with all his heart, A kiss which took her breath away; And, thenceforth, they were hand and glove, He Prince in arms, books, policy, Prince of Amanda too, and she A little, laughing flame of love. ‘Arms, policy and books must go,’ He sigh'd, ‘since she loves kisses so!’ But she, his bee by honey caught, Would only now her sweetness yield For meed of arduous honour, sought In Study, Parliament, or Field. And ever thus from kisses grow The thoughts that soar 'bove kisses so! MIGNONNE Whate'er thou dost thou'rt dear. Uncertain troubles sanctify That magic well-spring of the willing tear, Thine eye. Thy jealous fear, With not the rustle of a rival near; Thy careless disregard of all My tenderest care; Thy dumb despair When thy keen wit my worship may construe Into contempt of thy divinity; They please me too! But should it once befall These accidental charms to disappear, Leaving withal Thy sometime self the same throughout the year, So glowing, grave and shy, Kind, talkative and dear As now thou sitt'st to ply The fireside tune Of that neat engine deft at which thou sew'st With fingers mild and foot like the new moon, O, then what cross of any further fate Could my content abate? Forget, then, (but I know Thou canst not so,) Thy customs of some prædiluvian state. I am no Bullfinch, fair my Butterfly, That thou should'st try Those zigzag courses, in the welkin clear; Nor cruel Boy that, fledd'st thou straight Or paused, mayhap Might catch thee, for thy colours, with his cap. ALEXANDER AND LYCON ‘What, no crown won, These two whole years, By man of fortitude beyond his peers, In Thrace or Macedon?’ ‘No, none. But what deep trouble does my Lycon feel, And hide 'neath chat about the commonweal?’ ‘Glaucé but now the third time did again The thing which I forbade. I had to box her ears. 'Twas ill to see her both blue eyes Settled in tears Despairing on the skies, And the poor lip all pucker'd into pain; Yet, for her sake, from kisses to refrain!’ ‘Ho, Timocles, take down That crown. No, not that common one for blood with extreme valour spilt, But yonder, with the berries gilt. 'Tis, Lycon, thy just meed. To inflict unmoved And firm to bear the woes of the Beloved Is fortitude indeed.’ SEMELE No praise to me! My joy 'twas to be nothing but the glass Thro' which the general boon of Heaven should pass, To focus upon thee. Nor is't thy blame Thou first should'st glow, and, after, fade i' the flame. It takes more might Than God has given thee, Dear, so long to feel delight. Shall I, alas, Reproach thee with thy change and my regret? Blind fumblers that we be About the portals of felicity! The wind of words would scatter, tears would wash Quite out the little heat Beneath the silent and chill-seeming ash, Perchance, still slumbering sweet. A RETROSPECT I, trusting that the truly sweet Would still be sweetly found the true, Sang, darkling, taught by heavenly heat, Songs which were wiser than I knew. To the unintelligible dream That melted like a gliding star, I said: ‘We part to meet, fair Gleam! You are eternal, for you are.’ To Love's strange riddle, fiery writ In flesh and spirit of all create, ‘Mocker,’ I said, ‘of mortal wit, Me you shall not mock. I can wait.’ 1886. THE END</field>
