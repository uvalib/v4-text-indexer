      <field name="fulltext">FIRST VOLUME DRAMATIC SCENES. None of these poems of a dramatic form were offered to the stage, being no better than Imaginary Conversations in metre. —W. S. L. COUNT JULIAN. CHARACTERS. Count Julian. Roderigo, King of Spain. Opas, Metropolitan of Seville. Sisabert, betrothed to Covilla. Muza, Prince of Mauritania. Abdalazis, son of Muza. Tarik, Moorish Chieftain. Covilla, daughter of Julian. Egilona, wife of Roderigo. Hernando, Osma, Ramiro, &amp;c., Officers. FIRST ACT FIRST SCENE. Camp of Julian. Opas. Julian. Opas. See her, Count Julian: if thou lovest God, See thy lost child. Julian. I have avenged me, Opas, More than enough: I only sought to hurl The brand of war on one detested head, And die upon his ruin. O my country! O lost to honour, to thyself, to me, Why on barbarian hands devolves thy cause, Spoilers, blasphemers! Opas. Is it thus, Don Julian, When thy own offspring, that beloved child For whom alone these very acts were done By them and thee, when thy Covilla stands An outcast and a suppliant at thy gate, Why that still stubborn agony of soul, Those struggles with the bars thyself imposed? Is she not thine? not dear to thee as ever? Julian. Father of mercies! show me none, whene'er The wrongs she suffers cease to wring my heart, Or I seek solace ever, but in death. Opas. What wilt thou do then, too unhappy man? Julian. What have I done already? All my peace Has vanisht; my fair fame in aftertime Will wear an alien and uncomely form, Seen o'er the cities I have laid in dust, Countrymen slaughtered, friends abjured! Opas. And faith? Julian. Alone now left me, filling up in part The narrow and waste interval of grief: It promises that I shall see again My own lost child. Opas. Yes, at this very hour. Julian. Till I have met the tyrant face to face, And gain'd a conquest greater than the last, Till he no longer rules one rood of Spain, And not one Spaniard, not one enemy, The least relenting, flags upon his flight, Till we are equal in the eyes of men, The humblest and most wretched of our kind, No peace for me, no comfort, no . . no child! Opas. No pity for the thousands fatherless, The thousands childless like thyself, nay more, The thousands friendless, helpless, comfortless . . Such thou wilt make them, little thinking so, Who now perhaps, round their first winter fire, Banish, to talk of thee, the tales of old, Shedding true honest tears for thee unknown: Precious be these and sacred in thy sight, Mingle them not with blood from hearts thus kind. If only warlike spirits were evoked By the war-demon, I would not complain, Or dissolute and discontented men; But wherefore hurry down into the square The neighbourly, saluting, warm-clad race, Who would not injure us, and can not serve; Who, from their short and measured slumber risen, In the faint sunshine of their balconies, With a half-legend of a martyrdom And some weak wine and withered grapes before them, Note by their foot the wheel of melody That catches and rolls on the Sabbath dance. To drag the steady prop from failing age, Break the young stem that fondness twines around, Widen the solitude of lonely sighs, And scatter to the broad bleak wastes of day The ruins and the phantoms that replied, Ne'er be it thine. Julian. Arise, and save me, Spain! SECOND SCENE. Muza enters. Muza. Infidel chief, thou tarriest here too long, And art perhaps repining at the days Of nine continued victories o'er men Dear to thy soul, tho' reprobate and base. Away! [He retires. Julian. I follow. Could my bitterest foes Hear this! ye Spaniards, this! which I foreknew And yet encounter'd; could they see your Julian Receiving orders from and answering These desperate and heaven-abandoned slaves, They might perceive some few external pangs, Some glimpses of the hell wherein I move, Who never have been fathers. Opas. These are they To whom brave Spaniards must refer their wrongs! Julian. Muza, that cruel and suspicious chief, Distrusts his friends more than his enemies, Me more than either; fraud he loves and fears, And watches her still footfall day and night. Opas. O Julian! such a refuge! such a race! Julian. . . Calamities like mine alone implore. No virtues have redeem'd them from their bonds; Wily ferocity, keen idleness, And the close cringes of ill-whispering want, Educate them to plunder and obey: Active to serve him best whom most they fear, They show no mercy to the merciful, And racks alone remind them of the name. Opas. O everlasting curse for Spain and thee! Julian. Spain should have vindicated then her wrongs In mine, a Spaniard's and a soldier's wrongs. Opas. Julian, are thine the only wrongs on earth? And shall each Spaniard rather vindicate Thine than his own? is there no Judge of all? Shall mortal hand seize with impunity The sword of vengeance from the armoury Of the Most High? easy to wield, and starred With glory it appears; but all the host Of the archangels, should they strive at once, Would never close again its widening blade. Julian. He who provokes it hath so much to rue. Where'er he turn, whether to earth or heaven, He finds an enemy, or raises one. Opas. I never yet have seen where long success Hath followed him who warred upon his king. Julian. Because the virtue that inflicts the stroke Dies with him, and the rank ignoble heads Of plundering faction soon unite again, And prince-protected share the spoil at rest. THIRD SCENE. Guard announces a Herald. Opas departs. Guard. A messenger of peace is at the gate, My lord, safe access, private audience, And free return, he claims. Julian. Conduct him in. Roderigo enters as a herald. A messenger of peace! audacious man! In what attire appearest thou? a herald's? Under no garb can such a wretch be safe. Roderigo. Thy violence and fancied wrongs I know, And what thy sacrilegious hands would do, O traitor and apostate! Julian. What they would They can not: thee of kingdom and of life 'Tis easy to despoil, thyself the traitor, Thyself the violator of allegiance. O would all-righteous Heaven they could restore The joy of innocence, the calm of age, The probity of manhood, pride of arms, And confidence of honour! the august And holy laws trampled beneath thy feet, And Spain! O parent, I have lost thee too! Yes, thou wilt curse me in thy latter days, Me, thine avenger. I have fought her foe, Roderigo, I have gloried in her sons, Sublime in hardihood and piety: Her strength was mine: I, sailing by her cliffs, By promontory after promontory, Opening like flags along some castle-tower, Have sworn before the cross upon our mast Ne'er shall invader wave his standard there. Roderigo. Yet there thou plantest it, false man, thyself. Julian. Accursed he who makes me this reproach, And made it just! Had I been happy still, I had been blameless: I had died with glory Upon the walls of Ceuta. Roderigo. Which thy treason Surrendered to the Infidel. Julian. 'Tis hard And base to live beneath a conqueror; Yet, amid all this grief and infamy, 'Twere something to have rusht upon the ranks In their advance; 'twere something to have stood Defeat, discomfiture, and, when around No beacon blazes, no far axle groans Thro' the wide plain, no sound of sustenance Or succour soothes the still-believing ear, To fight upon the last dismantled tower, And yield to valour, if we yield at all. But rather should my neck lie trampled down By every Saracen and Moor on earth, Than my own country see her laws o'erturn'd By those who should protect them. Sir, no prince Shall ruin Spain, and, least of all, her own. Is any just or glorious act in view, Your oaths forbid it: is your avarice, Or, if there be such, any viler passion To have its giddy range and to be gorged, It rises over all your sacraments, A hooded mystery, holier than they all. Roderigo. Hear me, Don Julian; I have heard thy wrath Who am thy king, nor heard man's wrath before. Julian. Thou shalt hear mine, for thou art not my king. Roderigo. Knowest thou not the altered face of war? Xeres is ours; from every region round True loyal Spaniards throng into our camp: Nay, thy own friends and thy own family, From the remotest provinces, advance To crush rebellion: Sisabert is come, Disclaiming thee and thine; the Asturian hills Oppose to him their icy chains in vain; But never wilt thou see him, never more, Unless in adverse war and deadly hate. Julian. So lost to me! so generous, so deceived! I grieve to hear it. Roderigo. Come, I offer grace, Honour, dominion: send away these slaves, Or leave them to our sword, and all beyond The distant Ebro to the towns of France Shall bless thy name and bend before thy throne. I will myself accompany thee, I, The king, will hail thee brother. Julian. Ne'er shalt thou Henceforth be king: the nation in thy name May issue edicts, champions may command The vassal multitudes of marshal'd war, And the fierce charger shrink before the shouts, Lower'd as if earth had open'd at his feet, While thy mail'd semblance rises tow'rd the ranks, But God alone sees thee. Roderigo. What hopest thou? To conquer Spain, and rule a ravaged land? To compass me around? to murder me? Julian. No, Don Roderigo: swear thou, in the fight That thou wilt meet me, hand to hand, alone, That, if I ever save thee from a foe . . Roderigo. I swear what honour asks. First, to Covilla Do thou present my crown and dignity. Julian. Darest thou offer any price for shame? Roderigo. Love and repentance. Julian. Egilona lives; And were she buried with her ancestors, Covilla should not be the gaze of men, Should not, despoil'd of honour, rule the free. Roderigo. Stern man! her virtues well deserve the throne. Julian. And Egilona, what hath she deserv'd, The good, the lovely? Roderigo. But the realm in vain Hoped a succession. Julian. Thou hast torn away The roots of royalty. Roderigo. For her, for thee. Julian. Blind insolence! base insincerity! Power and renown no mortal ever shared Who could retain or grasp them to himself: And, for Covilla? patience! peace! for her? She call upon her God, and outrage him At his own altar! she repeat the vows She violates in repeating! who abhors Thee and thy crimes, and wants no crown of thine. Force may compel the abhorrent soul, or want Lash and pursue it to the public ways; Virtue looks back and weeps, and may return To these, but never near the abandon'd one Who drags religion to adultery's feet, And rears the altar higher for her sake. Roderigo. Have then the Saracens possest thee quite? And wilt thou never yield me thy consent? Julian. Never. Roderigo. So deep in guilt, in treachery! Forced to acknowledge it! forced to avow The traitor! Julian. Not to thee, who reignest not, But to a country ever dear to me, And dearer now than ever! What we love Is loveliest in departure! One I thought, As every father thinks, the best of all, Graceful and mild and sensible and chaste: Now all these qualities of form and soul Fade from before me, nor on any one Can I repose, or be consoled by any. And yet in this torn heart I love her more Than I could love her when I dwelt on each, Or claspt them all united, and thankt God, Without a wish beyond. Away, thou fiend! O ignominy, last and worst of all! I weep before thee . . like a child . . like mine . . And tell my woes, fount of them all! to thee! FOURTH SCENE. Abdalazis enters. Abdalazis. Julian, to thee, the terror of the faithless, I bring my father's order to prepare For the bright day that crowns thy brave exploits. Our enemy is at the very gate, And art thou here, with women in thy train, Crouching to gain admittance to their lord, And mourning the unkindness of delay! Julian (agitated, goes toward the door, and returns). I am prepared: Prince, judge not hastily. Abdalazis. Whether I should not promise all they ask, I too could hesitate, though earlier taught The duty to obey, and should rejoice To shelter in the universal storm A frame so delicate, so full of fears, So little used to outrage and to arms, As one of these, so humble, so uncheer'd At the gay pomp that smooths the track of war. When she beheld me from afar dismount, And heard my trumpet, she alone drew back, And, as though doubtful of the help she seeks, Shudder'd to see the jewels on my brow, And turn'd her eyes away, and wept aloud. The other stood awhile, and then advanced: I would have spoken; but she waved her hand And said, “Proceed, protect us, and avenge, And be thou worthier of the crown thou wearest.” Hopeful and happy is indeed our cause, When the most timid of the lovely hail Stranger and foe. Roderigo (unnoticed by Abdalazis). And shrink but to advance. Abdalazis. Thou tremblest? whence, O Julian! whence this change? Thou lovest still thy country. Julian. Abdalazis! All men with human feelings love their country. Not the highborn or wealthy man alone, Who looks upon his children, each one led By its gay handmaid from the high alcove, And hears them once a-day; not only he Who hath forgotten, when his guest inquires The name of some far village all his own; Whose rivers bound the province, and whose hills Touch the last cloud upon the level sky: No; better men still better love their country. 'Tis the old mansion of their earliest friends, The chapel of their first and best devotions. When violence or perfidy invades, Or when unworthy lords hold wassail there, And wiser heads are drooping round its moats, At last they fix their steady and stiff eye There, there alone, stand while the trumpet blows And view the hostile flames above its towers Spire, with a bitter and severe delight. Abdalazis (taking his hand). Thou feelest what thou speakest, and thy Spain Will ne'er be shelter'd from her fate by thee. We, whom the Prophet sends o'er many lands, Love none above another; Heaven assigns Their fields and harvests to our valiant swords, And 'tis enough: we love while we enjoy. Whence is the man in that fantastic guise? Suppliant? or herald? he who stalks about, And once was even seated while we spoke: For never came he with us o'er the sea. Julian. He comes as herald. Roderigo. Thou shalt know full soon, Insulting Moor! Abdalazis. He ill endures the grief His country suffers: I will pardon him. He lost his courage first, and then his mind; His courage rushes back, his mind yet wanders. The guest of heaven was piteous to these men, And princes stoop to feed them in their courts. FIFTH SCENE. Roderigo is going: Muza enters with Egilona: Roderigo starts back. Muza (sternly to Egilona). Enter, since 'tis the custom in this land. Egilona (passing Muza, points to Abdalazis). Is this our future monarch, or art thou? Julian. 'Tis Abdalazis, son of Muza, prince Commanding Africa, from Abyla To where Tunisian pilots bend the eye O'er ruin'd temples in the glassy wave. Till quiet times and ancient laws return He comes to govern here. Roderigo. To-morrow's dawn Proves that. Muza. What art thou? Roderigo (drawing his sword). King. Abdalazis. Amazement! Muza. Treason! Egilona. O horror! Muza. Seize him. Egilona. Spare him! fly to me! Julian. Urge me not to protect a guest, a herald, The blasts of war roar over him unfelt. Egilona. Ah fly, unhappy! Roderigo. Fly! no, Egilona! Dost thou forgive me? dost thou love me? still? Egilona. I hate, abominate, abhor thee . . go, Or my own vengeance . . Roderigo (takes Julian's hand; invites him to attack Muza and Abdalazis.) Julian! Julian. Hence, or die. SECOND ACT FIRST SCENE. Camp of Julian. Julian and Covilla. Julian. Obdurate? I am not as I appear. Weep, my beloved child! Covilla, weep Into my bosom; every drop be mine Of this most bitter soul-empoisoning cup: Into no other bosom than thy father's Canst thou or wouldst thou pour it. Covilla. Cease, my lord, My father, angel of my youth, when all Was innocence and peace. Julian. Arise, my love, Look up to heaven . . where else are souls like thine! Mingle in sweet communion with its children, Trust in its providence, its retribution, And I will cease to mourn; for, O my child, These tears corrode, but thine assuage, the heart. Covilla. And never shall I see my mother too, My own, my blessed mother? Julian. Thou shalt see Her and thy brothers. Covilla. No! I can not look On them, I can not meet their lovely eyes, I can not lift mine up from under theirs. We all were children when they went away; They now have fought hard battles, and are men, And camps and kings they know, and woes and crimes. Sir, will they never venture from the walls Into the plain? Remember, they are young, Hardy and emulous and hazardous, And who is left to guard them in the town? Julian. Peace is throughout the land: the various tribes Of that vast region sink at once to rest, Like one wide wood when every wind lies husht. Covilla. And war, in all its fury, roams o'er Spain! Julian. Alas! and will for ages: crimes are loose At which ensanguined War stands shuddering, And calls for vengeance from the powers above, Impatient of inflicting it himself. Nature in these new horrors is aghast At her own progeny, and knows them not. I am the minister of wrath; the hands That tremble at me, shall applaud me too, And seal their condemnation. Covilla. O kind father, Pursue the guilty, but remember Spain. Julian. Child, thou wert in thy nursery short time since, And latterly hast past the vacant hour Where the familiar voice of history Is hardly known, however nigh, attuned In softer accents to the sickened ear; But thou hast heard, for nurses tell these tales, Whether I drew my sword for Witiza Abandoned by the people he betrayed, Tho' brother to the woman who of all Was ever dearest to this broken heart, Till thou, my daughter, wert a prey to grief, And a brave country brookt the wrongs I bore. For I had seen Rusilla guide the steps Of her Theodofred, when burning brass Plunged its fierce fang into the fount of light, And Witiza's the guilt! when, bent with age, He knew the voice again, and told the name Of those whose proffer'd fortunes had been laid Before his throne, while happiness was there, And strain'd the sightless nerve tow'rd where they stood, At the forced memory of the very oaths He heard renew'd from each, but heard afar, For they were loud, and him the throng spurn'd off. Covilla. Who were all these? Julian. All who are seen to-day On prancing steeds richly caparisoned In loyal acclamation round Roderigo; Their sons beside them, loving one another Unfeignedly, thro' joy, while they themselves In mutual homage mutual scorn suppress. Their very walls and roofs are welcoming The king's approach, their storied tapestry Swells its rich arch for him triumphantly At every clarion blowing from below. Covilla. Such wicked men will never leave his side. Julian. For they are insects which see nought beyond Where they now crawl; whose changes are complete, Unless of habitation. Covilla. Whither go Creatures unfit for better or for worse? Julian. Some to the grave, where peace be with them! some Across the Pyrenean mountains far, Into the plains of France; suspicion there Will hang on every step from rich and poor, Grey quickly-glancing eyes will wrinkle round And courtesy will watch them, day and night. Shameless they are, yet will they blush amid A nation that ne'er blushes: some will drag The captive's chain, repair the shatter'd bark, Or heave it from a quicksand to the shore Among the marbles of the Lybian coast, Teach patience to the lion in his cage, And, by the order of a higher slave, Hold to the elephant their scanty fare To please the children while the parent sleeps. Covilla. Spaniards? Must they, dear father, lead such lives? Julian. All are not Spaniards who draw breath in Spain, Those are, who live for her, who die for her, Who love her glory, and lament her fall. O may I too . . Covilla. But peacefully, and late, Live and die here! Julian. I have, alas! myself Laid waste the hopes where my fond fancy stray'd, And view their ruins with unalter'd eyes. Covilla. My mother will at last return to you. Might I once more, but . . could I now? behold her Tell her . . ah me! what was my rash desire? No, never tell her these inhuman things, For they would waste her tender heart away As they waste mine; or tell when I have died, Only to show her that her every care Could not have saved, could not have comforted; That she herself, clasping me once again To her sad breast, had said, Covilla! go, Go, hide them in the bosom of thy God! Sweet mother! that far-distant voice I hear, And, passing out of youth and out of life, I would not turn at last, and disobey. SECOND SCENE. Sisabert enters. Sisabert. Uncle, and is it true, say, can it be, That thou art leader of these faithless Moors? That thou impeachest thy own daughter's fame Thro' the whole land, to seize upon the throne By the permission of these recreant slaves? What shall I call thee? art thou, speak Count Julian, A father, or a soldier, or a man? Julian. All, or this day had never seen me here. Sisabert. Of falsehood! worse than woman's! Covilla. Once, my cousin, Far gentler words were utter'd from your lips. If you loved me, you loved my father first, More justly and more steadily, ere love Was passion and illusion and deceit. Sisabert. I boast not that I never was deceived, Covilla, which beyond all boasts were base, Nor that I never loved; let this be thine. Illusions! just to stop us, not delay, Amuse, not occupy! Too true! when love Scatters its brilliant foam, and passes on To some fresh object in its natural course, Widely and openly and wanderingly, 'Tis better: narrow it, and it pours its gloom In one fierce cataract that stuns the soul. Ye hate the wretch ye make so, while ye choose Whoever knows you best and shuns you most. Covilla. Shun me then: be beloved more and more. Honour the hand that show'd you honour first, Love . . O my father! speak, proceed, persuade, Your voice alone can utter it . . another. Sisabert. Ah lost Covilla! can a thirst of power Alter thy heart thus to abandon mine, And change my very nature at one blow? Covilla. I told you, dearest Sisabert, 'twas vain To urge me more, to question or confute. Sisabert. I know it, for another wears the crown Of Witiza my father; who succeeds To king Roderigo will succeed to me. Yet thy cold perfidy still calls me dear, And o'er my aching temples breathes one gale Of days departed to return no more. Julian. Young man, avenge our cause. Sisabert. What cause avenge? Covilla. If I was ever dear to you, hear me, Not vengeance; heaven will give that signal soon. O Sisabert, the pangs I have endured On your long absence . . Sisabert. Will be now consoled. Thy father comes to mount my father's throne; But though I would not a usurper king, I prize his valour and defend his crown: No stranger and no traitor rules o'er me, Or unchastised inveigles humble Spain. Covilla, gavest thou no promises? Nor thou, Don Julian? Seek not to reply. Too well I know, too justly I despise, Thy false excuse, thy coward effrontery; Yes, when thou gavest them across the sea, An enemy wert thou to Mahomet, And no appellant to his faith or leagues. Julian. 'Tis well: a soldier hears throughout in silence. I urge no answer: to those words, I fear, Thy heart with sharp compunction will reply. Sisabert (to Covilla). Then I demand of thee, before thou reign, Answer me . . while I fought against the Frank Who dared to sue thee? blazon'd in the court, Not trailed thro' darkness, were our nuptial bands; No; Egilona joined our hands herself, The peers applauded and the king approved. Julian. Hast thou yet seen that king since thy return? Covilla. Father! O Father! Sisabert. I will not implore Of him or thee what I have lost for ever. These were not, when we parted, thy alarms; Far other, and far worthier of thy heart Were they, which Sisabert could banish then. Fear me not now, Covilla! thou hast changed, I am changed too. I lived but where thou livedst, My very life was portion'd off from thine: Upon the surface of thy happiness Day after day I gazed, I doted, there Was all I had, was all I coveted; So pure, serene, and boundless it appear'd: Yet, for we told each other every thought, Thou knowest well, if thou rememberest, At times I fear'd; as tho' some demon sent Suspicion without form into the world, To whisper unimaginary things. Then thy fond arguing banisht all but hope, Each wish and every feeling was with thine, Till I partook thy nature, and became Credulous and incredulous like thee. We, who have met so alter'd, meet no more. Mountains and seas! ye are not separation: Death! thou dividest, but unitest too In everlasting peace and faith sincere. Confiding love! where is thy resting-place? Where is thy truth, Covilla? where? . . Go, go . . I should believe thee and adore thee still. [Goes. Covilla. O Heaven! support me, or desert me quite, And leave me lifeless this too trying hour! He thinks me faithless. Julian. He must think thee so. Covilla. O tell him, tell him all, when I am dead . . He will die too, and we shall meet again. He will know all when these sad eyes are closed. Ah can not he before? must I appear The vilest . . O just Heaven! can it be thus? I am . . all earth resounds it . . lost, despised, Anguish and shame unutterable seize me. 'Tis palpable, no phantom, no delusion, No dream that wakens with o'erwhelming horror; Spaniard and Moor fight on this ground alone, And tear the arrow from my bleeding breast To pierce my father's, for alike they fear. Julian. Invulnerable, unassailable Are we, alone perhaps of human kind, Nor life allures us more nor death alarms. Covilla. Fallen, unpitied, unbelieved, unheard! I should have died long earlier. Gracious God! Desert me to my sufferings, but sustain My faith in thee! O hide me from the world, And from yourself, my father, from your fondness, That opened in this wilderness of woe A source of tears . . it else had burst my heart, Setting me free for ever: then perhaps A cruel war had not divided Spain, Had not o'erturn'd her cities and her altars, Had not endanger'd you! O haste afar Ere the last dreadful conflict that decides Whether we live beneath a foreign sway . . Julian. Or under him whose tyranny brought down The curse upon his people. O child! child! Urge me no further, talk not of the war, Remember not our country. Covilla. Not remember! What have the wretched else for consolation? What else have they who pining feed their woe? Can I, or should I, drive from memory All that was dear and sacred? all the joys Of innocence and peace? When no debate Was in the convent, but what hymn, whose voice, To whom among the blessed it arose, Swelling so sweet; when rang the vesper-bell And every finger ceast from the guitar, And every tongue was silent through our land; When, from remotest earth, friends met again, Hung on each other's neck, and but embraced, So sacred, still, and peaceful was the hour. Now, in what climate of the wasted world, Not unmolested long by the profane, Can I pour forth in secrecy to God My prayers and my repentance? where beside Is the last solace of the parting soul? Friends, brethren, parents, dear indeed, too dear Are they, but somewhat yet the heart requires, That it may leave them lighter and more blest. Julian. Wide are the regions of our far-famed land: Thou shalt arrive at her remotest bounds, See her best people, choose some holiest house; Whether where Castro from surrounding vines Hears the hoarse ocean roar among his caves, And, thro' the fissure in the green churchyard, The wind wail loud the calmest summer day; Or where Santona leans against the hill, Hidden from sea and land by groves and bowers. Covilla. O! for one moment in those pleasant scenes Thou placest me, and lighter air I breathe: Why could I not have rested, and heard on! My voice dissolves the vision quite away, Outcast from virtue, and from nature too! Julian. Nature and virtue! they shall perish first. God destined them for thee, and thee for them, Inseparably and eternally! The wisest and the best will prize thee most, And solitudes and cities will contend Which shall receive thee kindliest. Sigh not so: Violence and fraud will never penetrate Where piety and poverty retire, Intractable to them and valueless, And lookt at idly like the face of heaven. If strength be wanted for security, Mountains the guard, forbidding all approach With iron-pointed and uplifted gates, Thou wilt be welcome too in Aguilar, Impenetrable, marble-turreted, Surveying from aloft the limpid ford, The massive fane, the sylvan avenue; Whose hospitality I proved myself, A willing leader in no impious war When fame and freedom urged me; or mayst dwell In Reÿnosa's dry and thriftless dale, Unharvested beneath October moons, Among those frank and cordial villagers. They never saw us, and, poor simple souls! So little know they whom they call the great, Would pity one another less than us, In injury, disaster, or distress. Covilla. But they would ask each other whence our grief, That they might pity. Julian. Rest then just beyond, In the secluded scenes where Ebro springs And drives not from his fount the fallen leaf, So motionless and tranquil its repose. Covilla. Thither let us depart, and speedily. Julian. I can not go: I live not in the land I have reduced beneath such wretchedness: And who could leave the brave whose lives and fortunes Hang on his sword? Covilla. Me hou canst leave, my father; Ah yes, for it is past; too well thou seest My life and fortunes rest not upon thee. Long, happily . . could it be gloriously! Still mayst thou live, and save thy country still! Julian. Unconquerable land! unrival'd race! Whose bravery, too enduring, rues alike The power and weakness of accursed kings, How cruelly hast thou neglected me! Forcing me from thee, never to return, Nor in thy pangs and struggles to partake! I hear a voice! 'tis Egilona: come, Recall thy courage, dear unhappy girl, Let us away. THIRD SCENE. Egilona enters. Egilona. Remain; I order thee. Attend, and do thy duty: I am queen, Unbent to degradation. Covilla. I attend Ever most humbly and most gratefully, My too kind sovran, cousin now no more. Could I perform but half the services I owe her, I were happy for a time, Or dared I show her half my love, 'twere bliss. Egilona. Oh! I sink under gentleness like thine. Thy sight is death to me; and yet 'tis dear. The gaudy trappings of assumptive state Drop at the voice of nature to the earth, Before thy feet. I can not force myself To hate thee, to renounce thee; yet . . Covilla! Yet . . O distracting thought! 'tis hard to see, Hard to converse with, to admire, to love, As from my soul I do, and must do, thee, One who hath robb'd me of all pride and joy, All dignity, all fondness. I adored Roderigo. He was brave, and in discourse Most voluble; the masses of his mind Were vast, but varied; now absorb'd in gloom, Majestic, not austere; now their extent Opening and waving in bright levity . . Julian. Depart, my daughter. 'Twere as well to bear His presence as his praise. Go; she will dream This phantasm out, nor notice thee depart. [Covilla goes. Egilona. What pliancy! what tenderness! what life! O for the smiles of those who smile so seldom, The love of those who know no other love! Such he was, Egilona, who was thine. Julian. While he was worthy of the realm and thee. Egilona. Can it be true then, Julian, that thy aim Is sovranty? not virtue nor revenge? Julian. I swear to heaven, nor I nor child of mine Ever shall mount to this polluted throne. Egilona. Then am I yet a queen. The savage Moor Who could not conquer Ceuta from thy sword In his own country, not with every wile Of his whole race, not with his myriad crests Of cavalry, seen from the Calpian highths Like locusts on the parcht and gleamy coast, Will never conquer Spain. Julian. Spain then was conquer'd When fell her laws before the traitor king. FOURTH SCENE. Officer announces Opas. O queen, the metropolitan attends On matter of high import to the state, And wishes to confer in privacy. Egilona (to Julian). Adieu then; and whate'er betide the country, Sustain at least the honours of our house. [Julian goes before Opas enters. Opas. I can not but commend, O Egilona, Such resignation and such dignity. Indeed he is unworthy; yet a queen Rather to look for peace, and live remote From cities, and from courts, and from her lord, I hardly could expect in one so young, So early, widely, wondrously, admired. Egilona. I am resolv'd: religious men, good Opas, In this resemble the vain libertine; They find in woman no consistency, No virtue but devotion, such as comes To infancy or age or fear or love, Seeking a place of rest, and finding none Until it soar to heaven. Opas. A spring of mind That rises when all pressure is removed, Firmness in pious and in chaste resolves, But weakness in much fondness; these, O queen, I did expect, I own. Egilona. The better part Be mine; the worse hath been, and is no more. Opas. But if Roderigo have at length prevail'd That Egilona willingly resigns All claim to royalty, and casts away, Indifferent or estranged, the marriage-bond His perjury tore asunder, still the church Hardly can sanction his new nuptial rites. Egilona. What art thou saying? what new nuptial rites? Opas. Thou knowest not? Egilona. Am I a wife? a queen? Abandon it! my claim to royalty! Whose hand was on my head when I arose Queen of this land? whose benediction sealed My marriage-vow? who broke it? was it I? And wouldst thou, virtuous Opas, wouldst thou dim The glorious light of thy declining days? Wouldst thou administer the sacred vows And sanction them, and bless them, for another, And bid her live in peace while I am living? Go then? I execrate and banish him For ever from my sight: we were not born For happiness together; none on earth Were ever so dissimilar as we. He is not worth a tear, a wish, a thought; Never was I deceived in him; I found No tenderness, no fondness, from the first. A love of power, a love of perfidy, Such is the love that is return'd for mine. Ungrateful man! 'twas not the pageantry Of regal state, the clarions, nor the guard, Nor loyal valour, nor submissive beauty, Silence at my approach, awe at my voice, Happiness at my smile, that led my youth Toward Roderigo. I had lived obscure, In humbleness, in poverty, in want, Blest, O supremely blest, with him alone; And he abandons me, rejects me, scorns me, Insensible! inhuman! for another! Thou shalt repent thy wretched choice, false man! Crimes such as thine call loudly for perdition; Heaven will inflict it, and not I; but I Neither will fall alone nor live despised. [A trumpet sounds. Opas. Peace, Egilona! he arrives: compose Thy turbid thoughts, meet him with dignity. Egilona. He! in the camp of Julian! trust me, sir, He comes not hither, dares no longer use The signs of state, and flies from every foe. [Retires some distance. FIFTH SCENE. Enter Muza and Abdalazis. Muza to Abdalazis. I saw him but an instant, and disguised, Yet this is not the traitor; on his brow Observe the calm of wisdom and of years. Opas. Whom seekest thou? Muza. Him who was king I seek. He came array'd as herald to this tent. Abdalazis. Thy daughter! was she nigh? perhaps for her Was this disguise. Muza. Here, Abdalazis, kings Disguise from other causes; they obtain Beauty by violence, and power by fraud. Treason was his intent: we must admit Whoever come; our numbers are too small For question or selection, and the blood Of Spaniards shall win Spain for us to-day. Abdalazis. The wicked can not move from underneath Thy ruling eye. Muza. Right! Julian and Roderigo Are leagued against us, on these terms alone, That Julian's daughter weds the Christian king. Egilona (rushing forward). 'Tis true . . and I proclaim it. Abdalazis. Heaven and earth! Was it not thou, most lovely, most high-souled, Who wishedst us success, and me a crown? [Opas goes abruptly. Egilona. I give it . . I am Egilona, queen Of that detested man. Abdalazis. I touch the hand That chains down fortune to the throne of fate, And will avenge thee; for 'twas thy command, 'Tis Heaven's. My father! what retards our bliss? Why art thou silent? Muza. Inexperienced years Rather would rest on the soft lap, I see, Of pleasure, after the fierce gusts of war. O destiny! that callest me alone, Hapless, to keep the toilsome watch of state, Painful to age, unnatural to youth, Adverse to all society of friends, Equality, and liberty, and ease, The welcome cheer of the unbidden feast, The gay reply, light, sudden, like the leap Of the young forester's unbended bow, But, above all, to tenderness at home, And sweet security of kind concern Even from those who seem most truly ours. Who would resign all this, to be approacht, Like a sick infant by a canting nurse, To spread his arms in darkness, and to find One universal hollowness around? Forego a little while that bane of peace: Love may be cherisht. Abdalazis. 'Tis enough; I ask No other boon. Muza. Not victory? Abdalazis. Farewell, O queen! I will deserve thee; why do tears Silently drop, and slowly, down thy veil? I shall return to worship thee, and soon; Why this affliction? O, that I alone Could raise or could repress it! Egilona. We depart, Nor interrupt your counsels, nor impede; O may they prosper, whatsoe'er they be, And perfidy soon meet its just reward! The infirm and peaceful Opas . . whither gone? Muza. Stay, daughter; not for counsel are we met, But to secure our arms from treachery, O'erthrow and stifle base conspiracies, Involve in his own toils our false ally . . Egilona. Author of every woe I have endured! Ah sacrilegious man! he vowed to heaven None of his blood should ever mount the throne. Muza. Herein his vow indeed is ratified; Yet faithful ears have heard this offer made, And weighty was the conference that ensued, And long, not dubious; for what mortal e'er Refused alliance with illustrious power, Though some have given its enjoyments up, Tired and enfeebled by satiety? His friends and partisans, 'twas his pretence, Should pass uninterrupted; hence his camp Is open every day to enemies. You look around, O queen, as though you fear'd Their entrance. Julian I pursue no more; You conquer him. Return we. I bequeath Ruin, extermination, not reproach. How we may best attain your peace and will We must consider in some other place, Not, lady, in the midst of snares and wiles How to supplant your charms and seize your crown. I rescue it; fear not. Yes, we retire. Whatever is your wish becomes my own, Nor is there in this land but who obeys. [He leads her away. THIRD ACT FIRST SCENE. Palace in Xeres. Roderigo and Opas. Roderigo. Impossible! she could not thus resign Me, for a miscreant of Barbary, A mere adventurer; but that citron face Shall bleach and shrivel the whole winter long, There on yon cork-tree by the sallyport. She shall return. Opas. To fondness and to faith? Dost thou retain them, if she could return? Roderigo. Retain them? she has forfeited by this All right to fondness, all to royalty. Opas. Consider and speak calmly: she deserves Some pity, some reproof. Roderigo. To speak then calmly, Since thine eyes open and can see her guilt . . Infamous and atrocious! let her go . . Chains . . Opas. What! in Muza's camp? Roderigo. My scorn supreme! Opas. Say pity. Roderigo. Ay, ay, pity: that suits best. I loved her, but had loved her; three whole years Of pleasure, and of varied pleasure too, Had worn the soft impression half away. What I once felt, I would recall; the faint Responsive voice grew fainter each reply: Imagination sank amid the scenes It labour'd to create: the vivid joy Of fleeting youth I follow'd and possest. 'Tis the first moment of the tenderest hour, 'Tis the first mien on entering new delights, We give our peace, our power, our souls, for these. Opas. Thou hast; and what remains? Roderigo. Roderigo: one Whom hatred can not reach nor love cast down. Opas. Nor gratitude nor pity nor remorse Call back, nor vows nor earth nor heaven controul. But art thou free and happy? art thou safe? By shrewd contempt the humblest may chastise Whom scarlet and its ermine can not scare, And the sword skulks for eveywhere in vain. Thee the poor victim of thy outrages, Woman, with all her weakness, may despise. Roderigo. But first let quiet age have intervened. Opas. Ne'er will the peace or apathy of age Be thine, or twilight steal upon thy day. The violent choose, but cannot change, their end; Violence, by man or nature, must be theirs; Thine it must be; and who to pity thee? Roderigo. Behold my solace! none. I want no pity. Opas. Proclaim we those the happiest of mankind Who never knew a want? O what a curse To thee this utter ignorance of thine! Julian, whom all the good commiserate, Sees thee below him far in happiness. A state indeed of no quick restlessness, No glancing agitation, one vast swell Of melancholy, deep, impassable, Interminable, where his spirit alone Broods and o'ershadows all, bears him from earth, And purifies his chasten'd soul for heaven. Both heaven and earth shall from thy grasp recede. Whether on death or life thou arguest, Untutor'd savage or corrupted heathen Avows no sentiment so vile as thine. Roderigo. Nor feels? Opas. O human nature! I have heard The secrets of the soul, and pitied thee. Bad and accursed things have men confess'd Before me, but have left them unarrayed, Naked, and shivering with deformity. The troubled dreams and deafening gush of youth Fling o'er the fancy, struggling to be free, Discordant and impracticable things: If the good shudder at their past escapes, Shall not the wicked shudder at their crimes? They shall: and I denounce upon thy head God's vengeance: thou shalt rule this land no more. Roderigo. What! my own kindred leave me and renounce me! Opas. Kindred? and is there any in our world So near us as those sources of all joy, Those on whose bosom every gale of life Blows softly, who reflect our images In loveliness through sorrows and through age, And bear them onward far beyond the grave? Roderigo. Methinks, most reverend Opas, not inapt Are these fair views; arise they from Seville? Opas. He who can scoff at them, may scoff at me. Such are we, that the Giver of all Good Shall, in the heart he purifies, possess The latest love; the earliest, no, not there! I've known the firm and faithful: even from them Life's eddying spring shed the first bloom on earth. I pity them, but ask their pity too: I love the happiness of men, and praise And sanctify the blessings I renounce. Roderigo. Yet would thy baleful influence undermine The heaven-appointed throne. Opas. The throne of guilt Obdurate, without plea, without remorse. Roderigo. What power hast thou? perhaps thou soon wilt want A place of refuge. Opas. Rather say, perhaps My place of refuge will receive me soon. Could I extend it even to thy crimes, It should be open; but the wrath of heaven Turns them against thee and subverts thy sway: It leaves thee not, what wickedness and woe Oft in their drear communion taste together, Hope and repentance. Roderigo. But it leaves me arms, Vigour of soul and body, and a race Subject by law and dutiful by choice, Whose hand is never to be holden fast Within the closing cleft of gnarled creeds; No easy prey for these vile mitred Moors. I, who received thy homage, may retort Thy threats, vain prelate, and abase thy pride. Opas. Low must be those whom mortal can sink lower, Nor high are they whom human power may raise. Roderigo. Judge now: for hear the signal. Opas. And derides Thy buoyant heart the dubious gulphs of war? Trumpets may sound, and not to victory. Roderigo. The traitor and his daughter feel my power. Opas. Just God! avert it! Roderigo. Seize this rebel priest. I will alone subdue my enemies. [Goes out. SECOND SCENE. Ramiro and Osma enter from opposite sides. Ramiro. Where is the king? his car is at the gate, His ministers attend him, but his foes Are yet more prompt, nor will await delay. Osma. Nor need they, for he meets them as I speak. Ramiro. With all his forces? or our cause is lost. Julian and Sisabert surround the walls. Osma. Surround, sayst thou? enter they not the gates? Ramiro. Perhaps ere now they enter. Osma. Sisabert Brings him our prisoner. Ramiro. They are friends! they held A parley; and the soldiers, when they saw Count Julian, lower'd their arms and hail'd him king. Osma. How? and he leads them in the name of king? Ramiro. He leads them; but amid that acclamation He turn'd away his head, and call'd for vengeance. Osma. In Sisabert, and in the cavalry He led, were all our hopes. Opas. Woe, woe is theirs Who have no other. Osma. What are thine? obey The just commands of our offended king: Conduct him to the tower . . off . . instantly. [Guard hesitates: Opas goes. Ramiro, let us haste to reinforce . . Ramiro. Hark! is the king defeated? hark! Osma. I hear Such acclamation as from victory Arises not, but rather from revolt, Reiterated, interrupted, lost. Favour like this his genius will retrieve By time or promises or chastisement, Whiche'er he choose; the speediest is the best. His danger and his glory let us share; 'Tis ours to serve him. Ramiro. While he rules 'tis ours. What chariot-wheels are thundering o'er the bridge? Osma. Roderigo's; I well know them. Ramiro. Now, the burst Of acclamation! now! again, again. Osma. I know the voices; they are for Roderigo. Ramiro. Stay, I entreat thee. One hath now prevail'd. So far is certain. Osma. Ay, the right prevails. Ramiro. Transient and vain their joyance who rejoice Precipitately and intemperately, And bitter thoughts grow up where'er it fell. Osma. Nor vain and transient theirs who idly float Down popularity's unfertile stream, And fancy all their own that rises round. Ramiro. If thou yet lovest, as I know thou dost, Thy king . . Osma. I love him; for he owes me much, Brave soul! and can not, though he would, repay. Service and faith, pure faith and service hard, Throughout his reign, if these things be desert, These have I borne toward him, and still bear. Ramiro. Come, from thy solitary eyrie come, And share the prey, so plenteous and profuse, Which a less valorous brood will else consume. Much fruit is shaken down in civil storms: And shall not orderly and loyal hands Gather it up? (Loud Shouts.) Again! and yet refuse? How different are those citizens without From thee! from thy serenity! thy arch, Thy firmament, of intrepidity! For their new lord, whom they have never served, Afraid were they to shout, and only struck The pavement with their ferrels and their feet: Now they are certain of the great event Voices and hands they raise, and all contend Who shall be bravest in applauding most. Knowest thou these? Osma. Their voices I know well . . And can they shout for him they would have slain? A prince untried they welcome; soon their doubts Are blown afar. Ramiro. Yes, brighter scenes arise. The disunited he alone unites, The weak with hope he strengthens, and the strong With justice. Osma. Wait: praise him when time hath given A soundness and consistency to praise: He shares it amply who bestows it right. Ramiro. Doubtest thou? Osma. Be it so: let us away; New courtiers come. Ramiro. And why not join the new? Let us attend him and congratulate; Come on; they enter. Osma. This is now my post No longer: I could face them in the field, I can not here. Ramiro. To-morrow all may change; Be comforted. Osma. I want nor change nor comfort. Ramiro. The prisoner's voice! Osma. The metropolitan's? Triumph he may . . not over me forgiven. This way, and thro' the chapel: none are there. [Goes out. THIRD SCENE. Opas and Sisabert. Opas. The royal threat still sounds along these halls: Hardly his foot hath past them, and he flees From his own treachery; all his pride, his hopes, Are scatter'd at a breath; even courage fails Now falsehood sinks from under him. Behold, Again art thou where reign'd thy ancestors; Behold the chapel of thy earliest prayers, Where I, whose chains are sunder'd at thy sight Ere they could close around these aged limbs, Received and blest thee, when thy mother's arm Was doubtful if it loost thee! with delight Have I observed the promises we made Deeply impressed and manfully perform'd. Now, to thyself beneficent, O prince, Never henceforth renew those weak complaints Against Covilla's vows and Julian's faith, His honour broken, and her heart estranged. O, if thou holdest peace or glory dear, Away with jealousy; brave Sisabert, Smite from thy bosom, smite that scorpion down: It swells and hardens amid mildew'd hopes, O'erspreads and blackens whate'er most delights, And renders us, haters of loveliness, The lowest of the fiends; ambition led The higher on, furious to dispossess, From admiration sprung and frenzied love. This disengenuous soul-debasing passion, Rising from abject and most sordid fear, Consumes the vitals, pines, and never dies. For Julian's truth have I not pledged my own? Have I not sworn Covilla weds no other? Sisabert. Her persecutor have not I chastised? Have not I fought for Julian, won the town, And liberated thee? Opas. But left for him The dangers of pursuit, of ambuscade, Of absence from thy high and splendid name. Sisabert. Do probity and truth want such supports? Opas. Gryphens and eagles, ivory and gold, Can add no clearness to the lamp above, But many look for them in palaces Who have them not, and want them not, at home. Virtue and valour and experience Are never trusted by themselves alone Further than infancy and idiocy: The men around him, not the man himself, Are lookt at, and by these is he preferr'd. 'Tis the green mantle of the warrener And his loud whistle that alone attract The lofty gazes of the noble herd: And thus, without thy countenance and help Feeble and faint is yet our confidence, Brief perhaps our success. Sisabert. Should I resign To Abdalazis her I once adored? He truly, he must wed a Spanish queen! He rule in Spain! ah! whom could any land Obey so gladly as the meek, the humble, The friend of all who have no friend beside, Covilla! could he choose or could he find Another who might so confirm his power? And now indeed from long domestic wars Who else survives of all our ancient house? Opas. But Egilona. Sisabert. Vainly she upbraids Roderigo. Opas. She divorces him, abjures, And carries vengeance to that hideous highth Which piety and chastity would shrink To look from, on the world or on themselves. Sisabert. She may forgive him yet. Opas. Ah, Sisabert! Wretched are those a woman has forgiven: With her forgiveness ne'er hath love return'd. Ye know not till too late the filmy tie That holds heaven's precious boon eternally To such as fondly cherish her; once go Driven by mad passion, strike but at her peace, And, though she step aside from broad reproach, Yet every softer virtue dies away. Beaming with virtue inaccessible Stood Egilona; for her lord she lived, And for the heavens that raised her sphere so high: All thoughts were on her, all, beside her own. Negligent as the blossoms of the field, Array'd in candour and simplicity, Before her path she heard the streams of joy Murmur her name in all their cadences, Saw them in every scene, in light, in shade, Reflect her image, but acknowledged them Hers most complete when flowing from her most. All things in want of her, herself of none, Pomp and dominion lay beneath her feet Unfelt and unregarded. Now behold The earthly passions war against the heavenly! Pride against love, ambition and revenge Against devotion and compliancy: Her glorious beams adversity hath blunted; And coming nearer to our quiet view, The original clay of coarse mortality Hardens and flaws around her. Sisabert. Every germ Of virtue perishes when love recedes From those hot shifting sands, the female heart. Opas. His was the fault; be his the punishment. 'Tis not their own crimes only, men commit, They harrow them into another's breast, And they shall reap the bitter growth with pain. Sisabert. Yes, blooming royalty will first attract These creatures of the desert. Now I breathe More freely. She is theirs if I pursue The fugitive again. He well deserves The death he flies from. Stay! Don Julian twice Call'd him aloud, and he, methinks, replied. Could not I have remain'd a moment more And seen the end? although with hurried voice He bade me intercept the scattered foes, And hold the city barr'd to their return. May Egilona be another's wife Whether he die or live! but oh! Covilla! She never can be mine! yet she may be Still happy . . no, Covilla, no . . not happy, But more deserving happiness without it. Mine never! nor another's. 'Tis enough. The tears I shed no rival can deride; In the fond intercourse a name once cherisht Will never be defended by faint smiles, Nor given up with vows of alter'd love. And is the passion of my soul at last Reduced to this? is this my happiness? This my sole comfort? this the close of all Those promises, those tears, those last adieus, And those long vigils for the morrow's dawn? Opas. Arouse thee! be thyself. O Sisabert, Awake to glory from these feverish dreams: The enemy is in our land; two enemies; We must quell both: shame on us if we fail. Sisabert. Incredible! a nation be subdued Peopled as ours. Opas. Corruption may subvert What force could never. Sisabert. Traitors may. Opas. Alas! If traitors can, the basis is but frail. I mean such traitors as the vacant world Echoes most stunningly: not fur-robed knaves Whose whispers raise the dreaming bloodhound's ear Against benighted famisht wanderers, While with remorseless guilt they undermine Palace and shed, their very father's house. O blind! their own, their children's heritage, To leave more ample space for fearful wealth. Plunder in some most harmless guise they swathe, Call it some very meek and hallow'd name, Some known and borne by their good forefathers, And own and vaunt it thus redeem'd from sin. These are the plagues heaven sends o'er every land Before it sink . . the portents of the street, Not of the air . . lest nations should complain Of distance or of dimness in the signs, Flaring from far to Wisdom's eye alone: These are the last: these, when the sun rides high In the forenoon of doomsday, revelling, Make men abhor the earth, arraign the skies. Ye who behold them spoil field after field, Despising them in individual strength, Not with one torrent sweeping them away Into the ocean of eternity, Arise! despatch! no renovating gale, No second spring awaits you: up, begone, If you have force and courage even for flight. The blast of dissolution is behind. Sisabert. How terrible! how true! what voice like thine Can rouse and warn the nation! If she rise, Say, whither go, where stop we? Opas. God will guide. Let us pursue the oppressor to destruction; The rest is heaven's: must we move no step Because we can not see the boundaries Of our long way, and every stone between? Sisabert. Is not thy vengeance for the late affront, For threats and outrage and imprisonment? Opas. For outrage, yes; imprisonment and threats I pardon him, and whatsoever ill He could do me. Sisabert. To hold Covilla from me! To urge her into vows against her faith, Against her beauty, youth, and inclination, Without her mother's blessing, nay, without Her father's knowledge and authority, So that she never will behold me more, Flying afar for refuge and for help Where never friend but God will comfort her! Opas. These and more barbarous deeds were perpetrated. Sisabert. Yet her proud father deign'd not to inform Me, whom he loved and taught, in peace and war, Me, whom he called his son before I hoped To merit it by marriage or by arms. He offer'd no excuse, no plea; exprest No sorrow; but with firm unfaltering voice Commanded me . . I trembled as he spoke . . To follow where he led, redress his wrongs, And vindicate the honour of his child. He call'd on God, the witness of his cause, On Spain the partner of his victories; And yet amid these animating words Roll'd the huge tear down his unvisor'd face; A general swell of indignation rose Thro' the long line, sobs burst from every breast, Hardly one voice succeeded; you might hear The impatient hoof strike the soft sandy plain. But when the gates flew open, and the king In his high car came forth triumphantly, Then was Count Julian's stature more elate; Tremendous was the smile that smote the eyes Of all he past. ‘Fathers, and sons, and brothers,’ He cried, ‘I fight your battles, follow me! Soldiers we know no danger but disgrace!’ ‘Father, and general, and king,’ they shout, And would proclaim him: back he cast his face, Pallid with grief, and one loud groan burst forth; It kindled vengeance thro' the Asturian ranks, And they soon scatter'd, as the blasts of heaven Scatter the leaves and dust, the astonisht foe. Opas. And doubtest thou his truth? Sisabert. I love . . and doubt . . Fight . . and believe: Roderigo spoke untruths; In him I place no trust; but Julian holds Truths in reserve: how should I quite confide! Opas. By sorrows thou beholdest him opprest; Doubt the more prosperous. March, Sisabert, Once more against his enemy and ours: Much hath been done, but much there yet remains. FOURTH ACT FIRST SCENE. Tent of Julian. Roderigo and Julian. Julian. The people had deserted thee, and throng'd My standard, had I raised it, at the first; But once subsiding, and no voice of mine Calling by name each grievance to each man, They, silent and submissive by degrees, Bore thy hard yoke, and hadst thou but opprest, Would still have borne it: thou hast now deceived; Thou hast done all a foreign foe could do And more against them; with ingratitude Not hell itself could arm the foreign foe; 'Tis forged at home and kills not from afar. Amid whate'er vain glories fell upon Thy rainbow span of power, which I dissolve, Boast not how thou conferredst wealth and rank, How thou preservedst me, my family, All my distinctions, all my offices, When Witiza was murder'd; that I stand Count Julian at this hour by special grace. The sword of Julian saved the walls of Ceuta, And not the shadow that attends his name: It was no badge, no title, that o'erthrew Soldier and steed and engine. Don Roderigo! The truly and the falsely great here differ: These by dull wealth or daring fraud advance; Him the Almighty calls amid his people To sway the wills and passions of mankind. The weak of heart and intellect beheld Thy splendour, and adored thee lord of Spain: I rose . . Roderigo lords o'er Spain no more. Roderigo. Now to a traitor's add a boaster's name. Julian. Shameless and arrogant, dost thou believe I boast for pride or pastime? forced to boast, Truth cost me more than falsehood e'er cost thee. Divested of that purple of the soul, That potency, that palm of wise ambition, Cast headlong by thy madness from that high, That only eminence 'twixt earth and heaven, Virtue, which some desert, but none despise, Whether thou art beheld again on earth, Whether a captive or a fugitive, Miner or galley-slave, depends on me; But he alone who made me what I am Can make me greater or can make me less. Roderigo. Chance, and chance only, threw me in thy power; Give me my sword again and try my strength. Julian. I tried it in the front of thousands. Roderigo. Death At least vouchsafe me from a soldier's hand. Julian. I love to hear thee ask it: now my own Would not be bitter; no, nor immature. Roderigo. Defy it, say thou rather. Julian. Death itself Shall not be granted thee, unless from God; A dole from his and from no other hand. Thou shalt now hear and own thine infamy. Roderigo. Chains, dungeons, tortures . . but I hear no more. Julian. Silence, thou wretch! live on . . ay, live . . abhorr'd. Thou shalt have tortures, dungeons, chains enough; They naturally rise and grow around Monsters like thee, everywhere, and for ever. Roderigo. Insulter of the fallen! must I endure Commands as well as threats? my vassal's too? Nor breathe from underneath his trampling feet? Julian. Could I speak patiently who speak to thee, I would say more: part of thy punishment It should be, to be taught. Roderigo. Reserve thy wisdom Until thy patience come, its best ally: I learn no lore, of peace or war, from thee. Julian. No, thou shalt study soon another tongue, And suns more ardent shall mature thy mind. Either the cross thou bearest, and thy knees Among the silent caves of Palestine Wear the sharp flints away with midnight prayer, Or thou shalt keep the fasts of Barbary, Shalt wait amid the crowds that throng the well From sultry noon till the skies fade again, To draw up water and to bring it home In the crackt gourd of some vile testy knave, Who spurns thee back with bastinaded foot For ignorance or delay of his command. Roderigo. Rather the poison or the bowstring. Julian. Slaves To other's passions die such deaths as those: Slaves to their own should die . . Roderigo. What worse? Julian. Their own. Roderigo. Is this thy counsel, renegade? Julian. Not mine: I point a better path, nay, force thee on. I shelter thee from every brave man's sword While I am near thee: I bestow on thee Life: if thou die, 'tis when thou sojournest Protected by this arm and voice no more: 'Tis slavishly, 'tis ignominiously, 'Tis by a villian's knive. Roderigo. By whose? Julian. Roderigo's. Roderigo. O powers of vengeance! must I hear? . . endure? . . Live? Julian. Call thy vassals: no? then wipe the drops Of froward childhood from thy shameless eyes. So! thou canst weep for passion; not for pity. Roderigo. One hour ago I ruled all Spain! a camp Not larger than a sheepfold stood alone Against me: now, no friend throughout the world Follows my steps or hearkens to my call. Behold the turns of fortune, and expect No better: of all faithless men the Moors Are the most faithless: from thy own experience Thou canst not value nor rely on them. Julian. I value not the mass that makes my sword, Yet while I use it I rely on it. Roderigo. Julian, thy gloomy soul still meditates . . Plainly I see it . . death to me . . pursue The dictates of thy leaders, let revenge Have its full sway, let Barbary prevail, And the pure creed her elders have embraced: Those placid sages hold assassination A most compendious supplement to law. Julian. Thou knowest not the one, nor I the other. Torn hast thou from me all my soul held dear, Her form, her voice, all, hast thou banisht from me, Nor dare I, wretched as I am! recall Those solaces of every grief erewhile. I stand abased before insulting crime, I falter like a criminal myself; The hand that hurl'd thy chariot o'er its wheels, That held thy steeds erect and motionless As molten statues on some palace-gate, Shakes as with palsied age before thee now. Gone is the treasure of my heart for ever, Without a father, mother, friend, or name. Daughter of Julian . . Such was her delight . . Such was mine too! what pride more innocent, What surely less deserving pangs like these, Than springs from filial and parental love! Debarr'd from every hope that issues forth To meet the balmy breath of early life, Her sadden'd days, all cold and colourless, Will stretch before her their whole weary length Amid the sameness of obscurity. She wanted not seclusion to unveil Her thoughts to heaven, cloister, nor midnight bell; She found it in all places, at all hours: While to assuage my labours she indulged A playfulness that shunn'd a mother's eye, Still to avert my perils there arose A piety that even from me retired. Roderigo. Such was she! what am I! those are the arms That are triumphant when the battle fails. O Julian! Julian! all thy former words Struck but the imbecile plumes of vanity, These thro' its steely coverings pierce the heart. I ask not life nor death; but, if I live, Send my most bitter enemy to watch My secret paths, send poverty, send pain . . I will add more . . wise as thou art, thou knowest No foe more furious than forgiven kings. I ask not then what thou would'st never grant: May heaven, O Julian, from thy hand receive A pardon'd man, a chasten'd criminal. Julian. This further curse hast thou inflicted; wretch! I can not pardon thee. Roderigo. Thy tone, thy mien, Refute those words. Julian. No . . I can not forgive. Roderigo. Upon my knee, my conqueror, I implore! Upon the earth, before thy feet . . hard heart! Julian. Audacious! hast thou never heard that prayer And scorn'd it? 'tis the last thou shouldst repeat. Upon the earth! upon her knees, O God? Roderigo. Resemble not a wretch so lost as I: Be better; O! be happier; and pronounce it. Julian. I swerve not from my purpose: thou art mine, Conquered; and I have sworn to dedicate, Like a torn banner on my chapel's roof, Thee to that power from whom thou hast rebell'd. Expiate thy crimes by prayer, by penances. Roderigo. Hasten the hour of trial, speak of peace. Pardon me not then, but with purer lips Implore of God, who would hear thee, to pardon. Julian. Hope it I may . . pronounce it . . O Roderigo! Ask it of him who can; I too will ask, And, in my own transgressions, pray for thine. Roderigo. One name I dare not . . Julian. Go; abstain from that; I do conjure thee, raise not in my soul Again the tempest that has wreckt my fame; Thou shalt not breathe in the same clime with her. Far o'er the unebbing sea thou shalt adore The eastern star, and may thy end be peace. SECOND SCENE. Roderigo goes: Hernando enters. Hernando. From the prince Tarik I am sent, my lord. Julian. A welcome messenger, my brave Hernando. How fares it with the gallant soul of Tarik? Hernando. Most joyfully; he scarcely had pronounced Your glorious name, and bid me urge your speed, Than, with a voice as though it answer'd heaven, ‘He shall confound them in their dark designs,’ Cried he, and turn'd away, with that swift stride Wherewith he meets and quells his enemies. Julian. Alas! I can not bear felicitation, Who shunn'd it even in felicity. Hernando. Often we hardly think ourselves the happy Unless we hear it said by those around. O my lord Julian, how your praises cheer'd Our poor endeavours! sure, all hearts are open, Lofty and low, wise and unwise, to praise. Even the departed spirit hovers round Our blessings and our prayers: the corse itself Hath shined with other light than the still stars Shed on its rest, or the dim taper nigh. My father, old men say who saw him dead, And heard your lips pronounce him good and happy, Smiled faintly through the quiet gloom that eve, And the shroud throbb'd upon his grateful breast. Howe'er it be, many who tell the tale Are good and happy from that voice of praise. His guidance and example were denied My youth and childhood: what I am I owe . . Julian. Hernando, look not back: a narrow path And arduous lies before thee: if thou stop Thou fallest; go right onward, nor observe Closely and rigidly another's way, But, free and active, follow up thy own. Hernando. The voice that urges now my manly step Onward in life, recalls me to the past, And from that fount I freshen for the goal. Early in youth, among us villagers Converse and ripen'd council you bestow'd. O happy days of (far departed!) peace, Days when the mighty Julian stoopt his brow Entering our cottage-door; another air Breath'd through the house, tired age and lightsome youth Beheld him with intensest gaze; these felt More chasten'd joy; they more profound repose. Yes, my best lord, when labour sent them home And midday suns, when from the social meal The wicker window held the summer heat, Prais'd have those been who, going unperceived, Open'd it wide that all might see you well: Nor were the children blamed, hurrying to watch Upon the mat what rush would last arise From your foot's pressure, ere the door was closed, And not yet wondering how they dared to love. Your counsels are more precious now than ever, But are they . . pardon if I err . . the same? Tarik is gallant, kind, the friend of Julian, Can he be more? or ought he to be less? Alas! his faith! Julian. In peace or war? Hernando. Hernando. O, neither; far above it; faith in God. Julian. 'Tis God's, not thine: embrace it not, nor hate it. Precious or vile, how dare we seize that offering, Scatter it, spurn it, in its way to heaven, Because we know it not? the sovran lord Accepts his tribute, myrrh and frankincense From some, from others penitence and prayer: Why intercept them from his gracious hand? Why dash them down? why smite the supplicant? Hernando. 'Tis what they do. Julian. Avoid it thou the more. If time were left me, I could hear well-pleased How Tarik fought up Calpe's fabled cliff, While I pursued the friends of Don Roderigo Across the plain, and drew fresh force from mine. O! had some other land, some other cause, Invited him and me, I then could dwell On this hard battle with unmixt delight. Hernando. Eternal is its glory, if the deed Be not forgotten till it be surpast: Much praise by land, by sea much more, he won, For then a Julian was not at his side, Nor led the van, nor awed the best before; The whole, a mighty whole, was his alone. There might be seen how far he shone above All others of the day: old Muza watcht From his own shore the richly laden fleet, Ill-arm'd and scatter'd, and pursued the rear Beyond those rocks that bear St Vincent's name, Cutting the treasure, not the strength, away; Valiant, where any prey lies undevour'd In hostile creek or too confiding isle. Tarik, with his small barks, but with such love As never chief from rugged sailor won, Smote their high masts and swelling rampires down, And Cadiz wept in fear o'er Trafalgar. Who that beheld our sails from off the highths, Like the white birds, nor larger, tempt the gale In sunshine and in shade, now almost touch The solitary shore, glance, turn, retire, Would think these lovely playmates could portend Such mischief to the world, such blood, such woe; Could draw to them from far the peaceful hinds, Cull the gay flower of cities, and divide Friends, children, every bond of human life; Could dissipate whole families, could sink Whole states in ruin, at one hour, one blow. Julian. Go, good Hernando? who would think these things? Say to the valiant Tarik I depart Forthwith: he knows not from what heaviness Of soul I linger here; I could endure No converse, no compassion, no approach, Other than thine, whom the same cares improved Beneath my father's roof, my foster-brother, To brighter days and happier end, I hope; In whose fidelity my own resides With Tarik and with his compeers and chief. I cannot share the gladness I excite, Yet shall our Tarik's generous heart rejoice. THIRD SCENE. Egilona enters: Hernando goes. Egilona. O fly me not because I am unhappy, Because I am deserted fly me not; It was not so before, and can it be Ever from Julian? Julian. What would Egilona That Julian's power with her new lords can do? Surely her own must there preponderate. Egilona. I hold no suit to them. Restore, restore Roderigo. Julian. He no longer is my prisoner. Egilona. Escapes he then? Julian. Escapes he, dost thou say? O Egilona! what unworthy passion . . Egilona. Unworthy, when I loved him, was my passion; The passion that now swells my heart is just. Julian. What fresh reproaches hath he merited? Egilona. Deep-rooted hatred shelters no reproach. But whither is he gone? Julian. Far from the walls. Egilona. And I knew nothing? Julian. His offence was known To thee at least. Egilona. Will it be expiated? Julian. I trust it will. Egilona. This withering calm consumes me. He marries then Covilla! 'twas for this His people were excited to rebell, His sceptre was thrown by, his vows were scorn'd, And I . . and I . . Julian. Cease, Egilona! Egilona. Cease? Sooner shalt thou to live than I to reign. FIFTH ACT FIRST SCENE. Tent of Muza. Muza. Tarik. Abdalazis. Muza. To have first landed on these shores appears Transcendant glory to the applauded Tarik. Tarik. Glory, but not transcendant, it appears, What might in any other. Muza. Of thyself All this vain boast? Tarik. Not of myself: 'twas Julian. Against his shield the refluent surges roll'd, While the sea-breezes threw the arrows wide, And fainter cheers urged the reluctant steeds. Muza. That Julian, of whose treason I have proofs, That Julian, who rejected my commands Twice, when our mortal foe besieged the camp, And forced my princely presence to his tent. Tarik. Say rather, who without one exhortation, One precious drop from true believer's vein, Marcht, and discomfited our enemies. I found in him no treachery. Hernando, Who, little versed in moody wiles, is gone To lead him hither, was by him assign'd My guide, and twice in doubtful fight his arm Protected me: once on the highths of Calpe, Once on the plain, when courtly jealousies Tore from the bravest and the best his due, And gave the dotard and the coward command: Then came Roderigo forth: the front of war Grew darker: him, equal in chivalry, Julian alone could with success oppose. Abdalazis. I doubt their worth who praise their enemies. Tarik. And theirs doubt I who persecute their friends. Muza. Thou art in league with him. Tarik. Thou wert, by oaths; I am without them; for his heart is brave. Muza. Am I to bear all this? Tarik. All this and more: Soon wilt thou see the man whom thou hast wrong'd, And the keen hatred in thy breast conceal'd Find its right way, and sting thee to the core. Muza. Hath he not foil'd us in the field? not held Our wisdom to reproach? Tarik. Shall we abandon All he hath left us in the eyes of men? Shall we again make him our adversary Whom we have proved so, long and fatally? If he subdue for us our enemies, Shall we raise others, or, for want of them, Convert him into one against his will? SECOND SCENE. Hernando enters. Tarik continues. Here comes Hernando from that prince himself. Muza. Who scorns, himself, to come. Hernando. The queen detains him. Abdalazis. How! Egilona? Muza. 'Twas my will. Tarik. At last He must be happy; for delicious calm Follows the fierce enjoyment of revenge. Hernando. That calm was never his, no other will be. Thou knowest not, and mayest thou never know, How bitter is the tear that fiery shame Scourges and tortures from the soldier's eye. Whichever of these bad reports be true, He hides it from all hearts to wring his own, And drags the heavy secret to the grave. Not victory that o'ershadows him sees he; No airy and light passion stirs abroad To ruffle or to soothe him; all are quell'd Beneath a mightier, sterner stress of mind: Wakeful he sits, and lonely, and unmoved, Beyond the arrows, views, or shouts of men; As oftentimes an eagle, ere the sun Throws o'er the varying earth his early ray, Stands solitary, stands immovable Upon some highest cliff, and rolls his eye, Clear, constant, unobservant, unabased, In the cold light above the dews of morn. He now assumes that quietness of soul Which never but in danger have I seen On his staid breast. Tarik. Danger is past; he conquers; No enemy is left him to subdue. Hernando. He sank not, while there was, into himself. Now plainly see I from his alter'd tone, He can not live much longer. Thanks to God! Tarik. What! wishest thou thy once kind master dead? Was he not kind to thee, ungrateful slave! Hernando. The gentlest, as the bravest, of mankind. Therefore shall memory dwell more tranquilly With Julian once at rest, than friendship could, Knowing him yearn for death with speechless love. For his own sake I could endure his loss, Pray for it, and thank God; yet mourn I must Him above all, so great, so bountiful, So blessed once! bitterly must I mourn. 'Tis not my solace that 'tis his desire; Of all who pass us in life's drear descent We grieve the most for those that wisht to die. A father to us all, he merited, Unhappy man! all a good father's joy In his own house, where seldom he hath been, But, ever mindful of its dear delights, He form'd one family around him ever. Tarik. Yes, we have seen and known him. Let his fame Refresh his friends, but let it stream afar, Nor in the twilight of home-scenes be lost. He chose the best, and cherisht them; he left To self-reproof the mutinies of vice; Avarice, that dwarfs Ambition's tone and mien; Envy, sick nursling of the court; and Pride That can not bear his semblance nor himself; And Malice, with blear visage half-descried Amid the shadows of her hiding-place. Hernando. What could I not endure, O gallant man, To hear him spoken of as thou hast spoken! O! I would almost be a slave to him Who calls me one. Muza. What! art thou not? begone. Tarik. Reply not, brave Hernando, but retire. All can revile, few only can reward. Behold the meed our mighty chief bestows! Accept it, for thy services, and mine. More, my bold Spaniard, hath obedience won Than anger, even in the ranks of war. Hernando. The soldier, not the Spaniard, shall obey. [Goes. Muza (to Tarik). Into our very council bringest thou Children of reprobation and perdition? Darkness thy deeds and emptiness thy speech, Such images thou raisest as buffoons Carry in merriment on festivals; Nor worthiness nor wisdom would display To public notice their deformities, Nor cherish them nor fear them; why shouldst thou? Tarik. I fear not them nor thee. THIRD SCENE. Egilona enters. Abdalazis. Advance, O queen. Now let the turbulence of faction cease. Muza. Whate'er thy purpose, speak, and be composed. Egilona. He goes; he is afar; he follows her; He leads her to the altar, to the throne; For, calm in vengeance, wise in wickedness, The traitor hath prevail'd, o'er him, o'er me, O'er you, the slaves, the dupes, the scorn of Julian. What have I heard! what have I seen! Muza. Proceed. Abdalazis. And I swear vengeance on his guilty head Who intercepts from thee the golden rays Of sovranty, who dares rescind thy rights, Who steals upon thy rest, and breathes around Empoison'd damps o'er that serenity Which leaves the world, and faintly lingers here. Muza. Who shuns thee . . Abdalazis. Whose desertion interdicts Homage, authority, precedency . . Muza. Till war shall rescue them . . Abdalazis. And love restored. Egilona. O generous Abdalazis! never! never! My enemies . . Julian alone remains . . The worst in safety, far beyond my reach, Breathe freely on the summit of their hopes, Because they never stopt, because they sprang From crime to crime, and trampled down remorse. Oh! if her heart knew tenderness like mine! Grant vengeance on the guilty; grant but that, I ask no more; my hand, my crown is thine. Fulfill the justice of offended heaven, Assert the sacred rights of royalty, Come not in vain, crush the rebellious crew, Crush, I implore, the indifferent and supine. Muza. Roderigo thus escaped from Julian's tent? Egilona. No, not escaped, escorted, like a king. The base Covilla first pursued her way On foot; but after her the royal car, Which bore me from San Pablo's to the throne, Empty indeed, yet ready at her voice, Roll'd o'er the plain amid the carcases Of those who fell in battle or in flight: She, a deceiver still, to whate'er speed The moment might incite her, often stopt To mingle prayers with the departing breath, Improvident! and those with heavy wounds Groan'd bitterly beneath her tottering knee. Tarik. Now, by the clement and the merciful! The girl did well. When I breathe out my soul, Oh! if compassion give one pang the more, That pang be mine; here be it, in this land: Such women are they in this land alone. Egilona. Insulting man! Muza. We shall confound him yet. Say, and speak quickly, whither went the king? Thou knewest where was Julian. Abdalazis. I will tell Without his answer: yes, my friends! yes, Tarik, Now will I speak, nor thou for once reply. There is, I hear, a poor half-ruined cell In Xeres, whither few indeed resort, Green are the walls within, green is the floor And slippery from disuse; for Christian feet Avoid it, as half-holy, half-accurst. Still in its dark recess fanatic Sin Abases to the ground his tangled hair, And servile scourges and reluctant groans Roll o'er the vault uninterruptedly, Till (such the natural stillness of the place) The very tear upon the damps below Drops audible, and the heart's throb replies. There is the idol maid of Christian creed, And taller images whose history I know not nor inquired. A scene of blood, Of resignation amid mortal pangs, And other things exceeding all belief. Hither the aged Opas of Seville Walkt slowly, and behind him was a man Barefooted, bruised, dejected, comfortless, In sackcloth; the white ashes on his head Dropt as he smote his breast; he gather'd up, Replaced them all, groan'd deeply, lookt to heaven, And held them like a treasure with claspt hands. Egilona. O! was Roderigo so abased? Muza. 'Twas he. Now, Egilona, judge between your friends And enemies: behold what wretches brought The king, thy lord, Roderigo, to disgrace. Egilona. He merited . . but not from them . . from me This, and much worse: had I inflicted it, I had rejoiced . . at what I ill endure. Muza. For thee, for thee alone, we wisht him here, But other hands releast him. Abdalazis. With what aim Will soon appear to those discerning eyes. Egilona. I pray thee, tell what past until that hour. Abdalazis. Few words, and indistinct: repentant sobs Fill'd the whole space; the taper in his hand, Lighting two small dim lamps before the altar, He gave to Opas; at the idol's feet He laid his crown, and wiped his tears away. The crown reverts not, but the tears return. Egilona. Yes, Abdalazis! soon, abundantly. If he had only call'd upon my name, Seeking my pardon e'er he lookt to heaven's, I could have . . no! he thought not once on me! Never shall he find peace or confidence; I will rely on fortune and on thee, Nor fear my future lot: sure, Abdalazis, A fall so great can never happen twice, Nor man again be faithless, like Roderigo. Abdalazis. Faithless he may be still, never so faithless. Fainter must be the charms, remote the days, When memory and dread example die, When love and terror thrill the heart no more, And Egilona is herself forgotten. FOURTH SCENE. Julian enters. Tarik. Turn, and behold him! who is now confounded? Ye who awaited him, where are ye? speak. Is some close comet blazing o'er your tents? Muza! Abdalazis! princes! conquerors! Summon, interrogate, command, condemn. Muza. Justly, Don Julian . . but respect for rank Allays resentment, nor interrogates Without due form . . justly may we accuse This absence from our councils, from our camp; This loneliness in which we still remain Who came invited to redress your wrongs. Where is the king? Julian. The people must decide. Muza. Imperfectly, I hope, I understand Those words, unworthy of thy birth and age. Julian. O chieftain, such have been our Gothic laws. Muza. Who then amid such turbulence is safe? Julian. He who observes them: 'tis no turbulence, It violates no peace: 'tis surely worth A voice, a breath of air, thus to create By their high will the man, form'd after them In their own image, vested with their power, To whom they trust their freedom and their lives. Muza. They trust! the people! God assigns the charge, Kings open but the book of destiny And read their names; all that remains for them The mystic hand from time to time reveals. Worst of idolaters! idolater Of that refractory and craving beast Whose den is in the city, at thy hand I claim our common enemy, the king. Julian. Sacred from justice then; but not from malice! Tarik. Surrender him, my friend: be sure his pains Will not be soften'd. Julian. 'Tis beyond my power. Tarik. To-morrow . . if in any distant fort He lies to-night: send after him. Julian. My faith Is plighted, and he lives . . no prisoner. Egilona. I knew the truth. Abdalazis. (to Julian). Now, Tarik, hear and judge. Was he not in thy camp? and in disguise? Tarik. No: I will answer thee. Muza. Audacious man! Had not the Kalif Walid placed thee here, Chains and a traitor's death should be thy doom. Speak, Abdalazis! Egilona, speak. Were ye not present? was not I myself? And aided not this Julian his escape? Julian. 'Tis true. Tarik. Away then friendship! to thy fate I leave thee: thou hast render'd Muza just, Me hostile to thee. Who is safe? a man Arm'd with such power, and with such perfidy! Julian. Stay, Tarik! hear me; for to thee alone Would I reply. Tarik. Thou hast replied already. [Goes. Muza. We, who were enemies, would not inquire Too narrowly what reasons urged thy wrath Against thy sovran lord: beneath his flag The Christians first assail'd us from these shores, And we seiz'd gladly the first aid we found To quell a wealthy and a warlike king. We never held to thee the vain pretence That 'twas thy quarrel our brave youth espoused, Thine, who hast wrought us much disgrace and woe. From perils and from losses here we rest And drink of the fresh fountain at our feet, Not madly following such illusive streams As overspread the dizzy wilderness, And vanish from the thirst they have seduced. Ours was the enterprise, the land is ours. What gain we by our toils, if he escape Whom we came hither solely to subdue? Julian. Is there no gain to live in amity? Muza. The gain of traffickers and idle men; Courage and zeal expire upon such calms. Further, what amity can Moors expect When you have joined your forces? Julian. From the hour That he was vanquisht, I have laid aside All power, all arms. Muza. How can we trust thee, once Deceived, and oftener than this once despised? Thou camest hither with no other aim Than to deprive Roderigo of his crown For thy own brow. Egilona. Julian, base man, 'tis true. He comes a prince, no warrior, at this hour. Muza. His sword, O queen, would not avail him now. Abdalazis. Julian, I feel less anger than regret. No violence of speech, no obloquy, No accusation shall escape my lips: Need there is none, nor reason, to avoid My questions: if thou value truth, reply. Hath not Roderigo left the town and camp? Hath not thy daughter? Egilona. Past the little brook Towards the Betis. From a tower I saw The fugitives, far on their way; they went Over one bridge, each with arm'd men . . not half A league of road between them . . and had join'd, But that the olive-groves along the path Conceal'd them from each other, not from me: Beneath me the whole level I survey'd, And, when my eyes no longer could discern Which track they took, I knew it from the storks Rising in clouds above the reedy plain. Muza. Deny it, if thou canst. Julian. I order'd it. Abdalazis. None could beside. Lo! things in such a mass Falling together on observant minds, Create suspicion and establish proof: Wanted there fresh . . why not employ our arms? Why go alone? Muza. To parley, to conspire, To reunite the Spaniards, which we saw, To give up treaties, close up enmities, And ratify the deed with Moorish blood. Julian. Gladly would Spain procure your safe return, Gladly would pay large treasures for the aid You brought against oppression. Muza. Pay she shall The treasures of her soil, her ports, her youth: If she resist, if she tumultuously Call forth her brigands and we lose a man, Dreadful shall be our justice; war shall rage Through every city, hamlet, house, and field, And, universal o'er the gasping land, Depopulation. Julian. They shall rue the day Who dare these things. Muza. Let order then prevail. In vain thou sendest far away thy child, Thy counsellor the metropolitan, And Sisabert: prudence is mine no less. Divide with us our conquests, but the king Must be deliver'd up. Julian. Never by me. Muza. False then were thy reproaches, false thy grief. Julian. O Egilona! were thine also feign'd? Abdalazis. Say, lovely queen, neglectful of thy charms Turn'd he his eyes toward the young Covilla? Did he pursue her to the mad excess Of breaking off her vows to Sisabert, And marrying her, against the Christian law? Muza. Did he prefer so? Abdalazis. Could he prefer To Egilona . . Egilona. Her! the child Covilla? Eternal hider of a foolish face, Incapable of any thing but shame, To me? old man! to me? O Abdalazis! No: he but follow'd with slow pace my hate. And can not pride check these unseemly tears? [Goes. Muza. The most offended, an offended woman, A wife, a queen, is silent on the deed. Abdalazis. Thou disingenuous and ignoble man, Spreading these rumours! sending into exile All those their blighting influence injured most: And whom? thy daughter and adopted son, The chieftains of thy laws and of thy faith. Call any witnesses, proclaim the truth, And set at last thy heart, thy fame, at rest. Julian. Not, if I purposed or desired to live, My own dishonour would I e'er proclaim Amid vindictive and reviling foes. Muza. Calling us foes, avows he not his guilt? Condemns he not the action we condemn, Owning it his, and owning it dishonour? 'Tis well my cares prest forward, and struck home. Julian. Why smilest thou? I never saw that smile But it portended an atrocious deed. Muza. After our manifold and stern assaults, With every tower and battlement destroy'd, The walls of Ceuta still were strong enough . . Julian. For what? who boasted now her brave defence, Or who forbade your entrance after peace? Muza. None: for who could? their engines now arose To throw thy sons into the arms of death. For this erect they their proud crests again. Mark him at last turn pale before a Moor. Julian. Imprudent have they been, their youth shall plead. Abdalazis. O father! could they not have been detain'd? Muza. Son, thou art safe, and wert not, while they lived. Abdalazis. I fear'd them not. Muza. And therefore wert not safe: Under their star the blooming Egilona Would watch for thee the nuptial lamp in vain. Julian. Never, oh never, hast thou workt a wile So barren of all good! Speak out at once, What hopest thou by striking this alarm? It shocks my reason, not my fears or fondness. Muza. Be happy then as ignorance can be; Soon wilt thou hear it shouted from our ranks. Those who once hurl'd defiance o'er our heads, Scorning our arms, and scoffing at our faith, The nightly wolf hath visited, unscared, And loathed them as her prey; for famine first, Achieving in few days the boast of years, Sank their young eyes and open'd us the gates: Ceuta, her port, her citadel, is ours. Julian. Blest boys! inhuman as thou art, what guilt Was theirs? Muza. Their father's. Julian. O support me, Heaven! Against this blow! all others I have borne. Ermenegild! thou mightest, sure, have lived! A father's name awoke no dread of thee! Only thy mother's early bloom was thine! There dwelt on Julian's brow . . thine was serene . . The brightened clouds of elevated souls, Fear'd by the most below: those who lookt up Saw at their season in clear signs advance Rapturous valour, calm solicitude, All that impatient youth would press from age, Or sparing age sigh and detract from youth: Hence was his fall! my hope! myself! my Julian Alas! I boasted . . but I thought on him, Inheritor of all . . all what? my wrongs . . Follower of me . . and whither? to the grave . . Ah no: it should have been so years far hence! Him at this moment I could pity most, But I most prided in him; now I know I loved a name, I doated on a shade. Sons! I approach the mansions of the just, And my arms clasp you in the same embrace, Where none shall sever you . . and do I weep! And do they triumph o'er my tenderness! I had forgotten my inveterate foes Everywhere nigh me, I had half forgotten Your very murderers, while I thought on you: For, O my children, ye fill all the space My soul would wander o'er . . O bounteous heaven! There is a presence, if the well-beloved Be torn from us by human violence, More intimate, pervading, and complete, Than when they lived and spoke like other men; And their pale images are our support When reason sinks, or threatens to desert us. I weep no more . . pity and exultation Sway and console me: are they . . no! . . both dead? Muza. Ay, and unsepulchred. Julian. Nor wept nor seen By any kindred and far-following eye? Muza. Their mother saw them, if not dead, expire. Julian. O cruelty . . to them indeed the least! My children, ye are happy . . ye have lived Of heart unconquer'd, honour unimpair'd, And died, true Spaniards, loyal to the last. Muza. Away with him. Julian. Slaves! not before I lift My voice to heaven and man: though enemies Surround me, and none else, yet other men And other times shall hear: the agony Of an opprest and of a bursting heart No violence can silence; at its voice The trumpet is o'erpower'd, and glory mute, And peace and war hide all their charms alike. Surely the guests and ministers of heaven Scatter it forth through all the elements, So suddenly, so widely, it extends, So fearfully men breathe it, shuddering To ask or fancy how it first arose. Muza. Yes, they shall shudder: but will that, henceforth, Molest my privacy, or shake my power? Julian. Guilt hath pavilions, but no privacy. The very engine of his hatred checks The torturer in his transport of revenge, Which, while it swells his bosom, shakes his power, And raises friends to his worst enemy. Muza. Where now are thine? will they not curse the day That gave thee birth, and hiss thy funeral! Thou hast left none who could have pitied thee. Julian. Many, nor those alone of tenderer mould, For me will weep; many, alas, through me! Already I behold my funeral; The turbid cities wave and swell with it, And wrongs are lost in that day's pageantry: Opprest and desolate, the countryman Receives it like a gift; he hastens home, Shows where the hoof of Moorish horse laid waste His narrow croft and winter garden-plot, Sweetens with fallen pride his children's lore, And points their hatred, but applauds their tears. Justice, who came not up to us through life, Loves to survey our likeness on our tombs, When rivalry, malevolence, and wrath, And every passion that once storm'd around, Is calm alike without them as within. Our very chains make the whole world our own, Bind those to us who else had past us by, Those at whose call, brought down to us, the light Of future ages lives upon our name. Muza. I may accelerate that meteor's fall, And quench that idle ineffectual light, Without the knowledge of thy distant world. Julian. My world and thine are not that distant one. Is age less wise, less merciful, than grief, To keep this secret from thee, poor old man! Thou canst not lessen, canst not aggravate My sufferings, canst not shorten or extend Half a sword's length between my God and me. I thank thee for that better thought than fame, Which none however, who deserve, despise, Nor lose from view till all things else are lost. Abdalazis. Julian, respect his age, regard his power. Many who fear'd not death, have dragg'd along A piteous life in darkness and in chains. Never was man so full of wretchedness But something may be suffered after all, Perhaps in what clings round his breast and helps To keep the ruin up, which he amid His agony and frenzy overlooks, But droops upon at last, and clasps and dies. Julian. Although a Muza send far underground, Into the quarry whence the palace rose, His mangled prey, climes alien and remote Mark and record the pang. While overhead Perhaps he passes on his favourite steed, Less heedful of the misery he inflicts Than of the expiring sparkle from a stone, Yet we, alive or dead, have fellow-men If ever we have served them, who collect From prisons and from dungeons our remains, And bear them in their bosom to their sons. Man's only relics are his benefits; These, be there ages, be there worlds, between, Retain him in communion with his kind: Hence is our solace, our security, Our sustenance, till heavenly truth descends, Covering with brightness and beatitude The frail foundations of these humbler hopes, And, like an angel guiding us, at once Leaves the loose chain and iron gate behind. Muza. Take thou my justice first, then hope for theirs. I, who can bend the living to my will, Fear not the dead, and court not the unborn: Their arm will never reach me, nor shall thine. Abdalazis. Pity, release him, pardon him, my father! Forget how much thou hatest perfidy. Think of him, once so potent, still so brave, So calm, so self-dependent in distress, I marvel at him: hardly dare I blame When I behold him fallen from so high, And so exalted after such a fall. Mighty must that man be, who can forgive A man so mighty; seize the hour to rise, Another never comes: O say, my father! Say, “Julian, be my enemy no more.” He fills me with a greater awe than e'er The field of battle, with himself the first, When every flag that waved along our host Droopt down the staff, as if the very winds Hung in suspense before him. Bid him go And peace be with him, or let me depart. Lo! like a god, sole and inscrutable, He stands above our pity. Julian. For that wish . . Vain as it is, 'tis virtuous . . O, for that, However wrong thy censure and thy praise, Kind Abdalazis! mayst thou never feel The rancour that consumes thy father's breast, Nor want the pity thou hast sought for mine! Muza. Now hast thou seal'd thy doom. Julian. And thou thy crimes. Abdalazis. O father! heed him not: those evil words Leave neither blight nor blemish: let him go. Muza. A boy, a very boy art thou indeed! One who in early day would sally out To chase the lion, and would call it sport, But, when more wary steps had closed him round, Slink from the circle, drop the toils, and blanch Like a lithe plant from under snow in spring. Abdalazis. He who ne'er shrank from danger, might shrink now, And ignominy would not follow here. Muza. Peace, Abdalazis! How is this? he bears Nothing that warrants him invulnerable: Shall I then shrink to smite him? shall my fears Be greatest at the blow that ends them all? Fears? no! 'tis justice, fair, immutable, Whose measured step at times advancing nigh Appals the majesty of kings themselves. O were he dead! though then revenge were o'er! FIFTH SCENE. Officer. Thy wife, Count Julian! Julian. Speak! Officer. Is dead. Julian. Adieu Earth! and the humblest of all earthly hopes, To hear of comfort, though to find it vain. Thou murderer of the helpless! shame of man! Shame of thy own base nature! 'tis an act He who could perpetrate could not avow, Stain'd, as he boasts to be, with innocent blood, Dead to reproach, and blind to retribution. Officer. Julian! be just; 'twill make thee less unhappy. Grief was her end: she held her younger boy And wept upon his cheek; his naked breast By recent death now hardening and inert, Slipt from her knee; again with frantic grasp She caught it, and it weigh'd her to the ground: There lay the dead. Julian. She? Officer. And the youth her son. Julian. Receive them to thy peace, eternal God! O soother of my hours, while I beheld The light of day, and thine! adieu, adieu! And, my Covilla! dost thou yet survive? Yes, my lost child, thou livest yet . . in shame! O agony, past utterance! past thought! That throwest death, as some light idle thing, With all its terrors, into dust and air, I will endure thee; I, whom heaven ordain'd Thus to have serv'd beneath my enemies, Their conqueror, thus to have revisited My native land with vengeance and with woe. Henceforward shall she recognise her sons, Impatient of oppression or disgrace, And rescue them, or perish; let her hold This compact, written with her blood and mine. Now follow me: but tremble: years shall roll And wars rage on, and Spain at last be free. IPPOLITO DI ESTE. [FIRST PART.] Ippolito. Now all the people follow the procession Here may I walk alone, and let my spirits Enjoy the coolness of these quiet aisles. Surely no air is stirring; every step Tires me; the columns shake, the ceiling fleets, The floor beneath me slopes, the altar rises. Stay! here she stept: what grace! what harmony! It seem'd that every accent, every note Of all the choral music, breath'd from her: From her celestial airiness of form I could have fancied purer light descended. Between the pillars, close and wearying, I watcht her as she went: I had rusht on; It was too late; yet, when I stopt, I thought I stopt full soon: I cried, Is she not there? She had been: I had seen her shadow burst The sunbeam as she parted: a strange sound, A sound that stupified and not aroused me, Fill'd all my senses: such was never felt Save when the sword-girt Angel struck the gate, And Paradise wail'd loud and closed for ever. She should return; the hour is past away. How can I bear to see her (yet I will) Springing, she fondly thinks, to meet the man I most abhor, my father's base-born son, Ferrante! Rosalba (entering). What! I called him? in my haste To languish at his beauty, to weigh down His eyelids with my lips for gazing on me: Surely I spoke the name, and knew it not Until it bounded back and smote me so! Ippolito. Curses upon them both! [Advancing toward her. Welcome, sweet lady! Rosalba. Lord Cardinal! you here? and unattended? Ippolito. We wait the happy lover, do we not? Rosalba. Ferrante then betrayed the secret to you! And are you come to honour with your presence . . Ippolito. Has the Duke sign'd the contract? Rosalba. For what bride? Ferrante writes Ferrante plain enough; And I do think, altho' I once or twice Have written it instead of mine, at last I am grown steadier, and could write Rosalba. Ippolito. Sport not with one your charms have cast too low. Rosalba. Sport not with one your hand would raise too high. Ippolito. Again that taunt! the time may come, Rosalba, When I could sanctify the blissful state I have aspired to. Rosalba. Am not I mere ice? Show not I girlish forwardness, the fears Of infancy, the scruples of old age? Have not you said so? and said more . . you hate them? How could you bear me, or what wish from me? Ippolito. That which another will not long retain. Rosalba. You know him little and me less. Ippolito. I know Inconstancy in him. Rosalba. And what in me? Ippolito. Intolerance for his betters. Rosalba. Ignorance, But not intolerance of them, is my fault. Ippolito. No? Rosalba. Call it thus, and cast it on the rest. Ippolito. Some are there whose close vision sees but one In the whole world, and would not see another For the whole world, were that one out of it. Rosalba. Are there some such? O may they be my friends! O how, before I know them, I do love them! Ippolito. After no strife, no censure, no complaint, Have not your tears been seen, when you have left him, Thro' tediousness, distaste, dislike, and grief (Ingenuous minds must feel it, and may own it) That love, so rashly promist, would retire, Hating exaction, circumvention, bonds? Rosalba. Such grief is yet unknown to me. I know All tears are not for sorrow: many swell In the warm depths of gratitude and bliss; But precious over all are those that hang And tremble at the tale of generous deeds. These he relates when he might talk, as you do, Of passion: but he sees my heart, he finds What fragrance most refreshes it. How high, O Heaven! must that man be, who loves, and who Would still raise others higher than himself To interest his beloved! All my soul Is but one drop from his, and into his Falls, as earth's dew falls into earth again. Ippolito. Yet would it not be wise to trust a friend Able to counsel in extremes and straits? Rosalba. Is it not wise in darkness and in storm To trust the wave that lashes us, and pray Its guidance on the rocks whereto it tends? I have my guide, Lord Cardinal! he alone Is ship and pilot to me, sea and star: Counsel from others, knowing him, would be Like worship of false gods; in me no less Than profanation and apostacy. Ippolito. We may retire; he comes not here to-day. Rosalba. Then will I not retire, but lay my head Upon the feet of any pitying saint Until he comes, altho' it be to-morrow. Ippolito. To-morrow he may fail: the sovran will By rescript has detained and must delay him. Rosalba. Lead, lead me to Ferrante. Ippolito. Were I worthy. Rosalba. Proud cruel man! that bitter sneer bodes ill. May not I see him? Ippolito. He may not see you. Rosalba. O let him! well my memory can supply His beauteous image; I can live on love Saturate, like bees with honey, long drear days; He must see me, or cannot rest; I can. SECOND PART. Ippolito, Ferrante, and Giulio, in prison. Ippolito. Reasons of state, I fear, have dictated This something like severity; God grant Here be no heresy: do both avow it, Staring in silence at discovery? Giulio. No order forced me hither; I am come To share my brother's fate, whate'er it be, And mitigate his sufferings. Ippolito. May they cease! Giulio. Those words would have dissolved them into air, Spoken but twenty furlongs from these bars. Ippolito. I would do much to serve you; but my faith And my allegiance have two other lords, The duke my brother, and the pope my God. Ferrante then says nothing? Ferrante. He well knows Thy hatred and its cause. Ippolito. Why should I hate you, . . . My father's son, they say? Ferrante. They say! His blood Runs in these veins, pure, for pure blood was hers Who loved the youthful lover, and who died When falser vows estranged the matchless prince. Ippolito. He saw his error. Ferrante. All men do when age Bends down their heads, or gold shines in their way. Ippolito. Altho' I would have helpt you in distress, And just removed you from the court awhile, You call'd me tyrant. Ferrante. Calléd thee tyrant? I? By Heaven! in tyrant there is something great That never was in thee. I would be killed Rather by any monster of the wild Than choakt by weeds and quicksands, rather crusht By maddest rage than clay-cold apathy. Those who act well the tyrant, neither seek Nor shun the name; and yet I wonder not That thou repeatest it, and wishest me; It sounds like power, like policy, like courage, And none who calls thee tyrant can despise thee. Go, issue orders for imprisonment, Warrants for death: the gibbet and the wheel, Lo! the grand boundaries of thy dominion! O what a mighty office for a minister (And such Alfonso's brother calls himself) To be the scribe of hawkers! Man of genius! The lanes and allies echo with thy works. Giulio. Ah! do not urge him; he may ruin you; He may pursue you to the grave. Ferrante. He dares not: Look at his collar! see the saint he wears! The amber saint may ask too much for that. Ippolito. Atheist! thy scoffs encourage every crime, And strip thee, like a pestilence, of friends: Theirs is the guilt to march against the law, They mount the scaffold, and the blow is thine. Ferrante. How venom burnishes his adder's crest, How eloquent on scaffolds and on laws! If such a noisome weed as falsehood is Give frothy vigour to a worm like thee, Crawl, eat, drink, sleep upon it, and farewell. Ippolito (to Giulio). Take you the sentence, and God be with both! [Goes. Giulio. What sentence have we here? Ferrante. Unseal and read it. Giulio (reading). Of sight! of sight! of sight! Ferrante. Would you escape, My gentle Giulio? Run not thus around The wide light chamber, press not thus your brow Against the walls, with your two palms above. Seek you the door then? you are uncondemned To lose the sight of one who is the bloom And breath of life to you: the bolts are drawn On me alone. You carry in your breast Most carefully our brother's precious gift: Well, take it anywhere, but do not hope Too much from any one. Time softens rocks, And hardens men. Giulio. Pray then our God for help. Ferrante. O my true brother, Giulio! why thus hang Around my neck and pour forth prayers for me? Where there are priests and kinsmen such as ours, God hears not, nor is heard. I am prepared For death. Giulio. Ah! worse than death may come upon you, Unless Heaven interpose. Ferrante. I know the worst, And bear one comfort in my breast that fire And steel can ne'er force from it: she I love Will not be his, but die as she hath lived. Doubt you? that thus you shake the head and sigh. Giulio. Far other doubt was mine: even this shall cease. Ferrante. Speak it. Giulio. I must: God pardon me! Ferrante. Speak on. Giulio. Have we not dwelt in friendship from our birth, Told the same courtier the same tale of joy, And pointed where life's earliest thorn had pierced Amid the sports of boyhood, ere the heart Hath aught of bitter or unsound within? Ferrante. We have indeed. Giulio. Has my advice been ill? Ferrante. Too often ill-observed, but always good. Giulio. Brother, my words are not what better men Would speak to you; and yet my love, I think, Must be more warm than theirs can ever be. Ferrante. Brother's, friend's, father's, when was it like yours? Giulio. Which of them ever said what I shall say? Ferrante. Speak; my desires are kindled, my fears quencht. Giulio. Do not delay to die, lest crueller Than common death befal you. Ferrante. Then the wheel Is ordered in that schedule! Must she too Have her chaste limbs laid bare? Here lies the rack; Here she would suffer ere it touch the skin. No, I will break it with the thread of life Ere the sound reach her. Talk no more of Heaven, Of Providence, of Justice. Look on her. Why should she suffer? what hath she from Heaven Of comfort or protection? Giulio. Talk not so. Pity comes down when Hope hath flown away. Ferrante. Illusion! Giulio. If it were, which it is not, Why break with vehement words such sweet illusion? For were there not above but empty air, Nought but the clear blue sky where birds delight, Soaring o'er myriad worlds of living dust That roll in columns round the noontide ray, Your heart would faint amid such solitude, Would shrink in such vacuity; that heart (Ferrante! can you hide its wants from me?) Rises and looks around and calls aloud For some kind Being, some consoling bosom, Whereon to place its sorrows, and to rest. Ferrante. Oh! that was here . . I cannot look beyond. Giulio. Hark! hear you not the people? to the window! They shout and clap their hands when they first meet you After short absence; what shall they now do? Up! seize the moment; show yourself. Ferrante. Stay, Giulio! Draw me not thither; speak not of my wrongs; I would await but not arouse their vengeance, And would deserve but court not their applause. Little of good shall good men hope from them, Nothing shall wiser. [Aside. O were he away! But if I fail, he must die too, being here. Giulio. Let me call out: they are below the grate: They would deliver you: try this one chance. Obdurate! would you hold me down? They're gone! Ferrante. Giulio! for shame! weep not, or here I stay And let vile hands deform me. Giulio. They shall never. Ferrante. What smoke arises? Are there torches under? Surely the crowd has past: 'tis from the stairs. Giulio. Anticipate the blow. Ferrante. One more must grieve! And will she grieve like you, too tender Giulio! Turn not away the head, the hand. What hold you? Give, give it me. 'Tis keen. They call you forth. Tell her . . no, say not we shall meet again, For tears flow always faster at those words . . May the thought come, but gently, like a dream. THE SHADES OF AGAMEMNON AND IPHIGENEIA. Iphigeneia. Father! I now may lean upon your breast, And you with unreverted eyes will grasp Iphigeneia's hand. We are not shades Surely! for yours throb yet. And did my blood Win Troy for Greece? Ah! 'twas ill done, to shrink; But the sword gleam'd so sharp; and the good priest Trembled, and Pallas frown'd above, severe. Agamemnon. Daughter! Iphigeneia Beloved father! is the blade Again to pierce my bosom? 'tis unfit For sacrifice; no blood is in its veins, No God requires it here; here are no wrongs To vindicate, no realms to overthrow. You standing as at Aulis in the fane, With face averted, holding (as before) My hand; but yours burns not, as then it burn'd; This alone shews me we are with the Blest, Nor subject to the sufferings we have borne. I will win back past kindness. Tell me then, Tell how my mother fares who loved me so, And griev'd, as 'twere for you, to see me part. Frown not, but pardon me for tarrying Amid too idle words, nor asking how She prais'd us both (which most?) for what we did. Agamemnon. Ye Gods who govern here! do human pangs Reach the pure soul thus far below? do tears Spring in these meadows? Iphigeneia. No, sweet father, no . . I could have answered that; why ask the Gods? Agamemnon. Iphigeneia! O my child! the Earth Has gendered crimes unheard of heretofore, And Nature may have changed in her last depths, Together with the Gods and all their laws. Iphigeneia. Father! we must not let you here condemn; Not, were the day less joyful: recollect We have no wicked here; no king to judge. Poseidon, we have heard, with bitter rage Lashes his foaming steeds against the skies, And, laughing with loud yell at winged fire, Innoxious to his fields and palaces Affrights the eagle from the sceptred hand; While Pluto, gentlest brother of the three And happiest in obedience, views sedate His tranquil realm, nor envies theirs above. No change have we, not even day for night Nor spring for summer. All things are serene, Serene too be your spirit! None on earth Ever was half so kindly in his house, And so compliant, even to a child. Never was snatch'd your robe away from me, Though going to the council. The blind man Knew his good king was leading him indoors, Before he heard the voice that marshal'd Greece. Therefore all prais'd you. Proudest men themselves In others praise humility, and most Admire it in the sceptre and the sword. What then can make you speak thus rapidly And briefly? in your step thus hesitate? Are you afraid to meet among the good Incestuous Helen here? Agamemnon. Oh! Gods of Hell! Iphigeneia. She hath not past the river. We may walk With our hands link'd nor feel our house's shame. Agamemnon. Never mayst thou, Iphigeneia, feel it! Aulis had no sharp sword, thou would'st exclaim, Greece no avenger . . I, her chief so late, Through Erebus, through Elysium, writhe beneath it. Iphigeneia. Come; I have better diadems than those Of Argos and Mycenai . . come away, And I will weave them for you on the bank. You will not look so pale when you have walked A little in the grove, and have told all Those sweet fond words the widow sent her child. Agamemnon. Oh Earth! I suffered less upon thy shores! [Aside. The bath that bubbled with my blood, the blows That spilt it (O worse torture!) must she know! Ah! the first woman coming from Mycenai Will pine to pour this poison in her ear, Taunting sad Charon for his slow advance. Iphigeneia! Iphigeneia. Why thus turn away! Calling me with such fondness! I am here, Father! and where you are, will ever be. Agamemnon. Thou art my child . . yes, yes, thou art my child. All was not once what all now is! come on, Idol of love and truth! my child! my child! [Alone. Fell woman! ever false! false was thy last Denunciation, as thy bridal vow; And yet even that found faith with me! The dirk Which sever'd flesh from flesh, where this hand rests, Severs not, as thou boastedst in thy scoffs, Iphigeneia's love from Agamemnon: The wife's a spark may light, a straw consume, The daughter's not her heart's whole fount hath quench'd, 'Tis worthy of the Gods, and lives for ever. Iphigeneia. What spake my father to the Gods above? Unworthy am I then to join in prayer? If, on the last, or any day before, Of my brief course on earth, I did amiss, Say it at once, and let me be unblest; But, O my faultless father! why should you? And shun so my embraces? Am I wild And wandering in my fondness? We are shades! Groan not thus deeply; blight not thus the season Of full-orb'd gladness! Shades we are indeed, But mingled, let us feel it, with the blest. I knew it, but forgot it suddenly, Altho' I felt it all at your approach. Look on me; smile with me at my illusion . . You are so like what you have ever been (Except in sorrow!) I might well forget I could not win you as I used to do. It was the first embrace since my descent I ever aim'd at: those who love me live, Save one, who loves me most, and now would chide me. Agamemnon. We want not, O Iphigeneia, we Want not embrace, nor kiss that cools the heart With purity, nor words that more and more Teach what we know, from those we know, and sink Often most deeply where they fall most light. Time was when for the faintest breath of thine Kingdom and life were little. Iphigeneia. Value them As little now. Agamemnon. Were life and kingdom all! Iphigeneia. Ah! by our death many are sad who loved us. The little fond Electra, and Orestes So childish and so bold! O that mad boy! They will be happy too. Cheer! king of men! Cheer! there are voices, songs . . Cheer! arms advance. Agamemnon. Come to me, soul of peace! These, these alone, These are not false embraces. Iphigeneia. Both are happy! Agamemnon. Freshness breathes round me from some breeze above. What are ye, winged ones! with golden urns? The Hours (Descending.) The Hours . . To each an urn we bring. Earth's purest gold Alone can hold The lymph of the Lethean spring. We, son of Atreus, we divide The dulcet from the bitter tide That runs athwart the paths of men. No more our pinions shalt thou see. Take comfort! We have done with thee, And must away to earth again. [Ascending. Where thou art, thou Of braided brow, Thou cull'd too soon from Argive bow'rs, Where thy sweet voice is heard among The shades that thrill with choral song, None can regret the parted Hours. Chorus of Argives. Maiden! be thou the spirit that breathes Triumph and joy into our song! Wear and bestow these amaranth-wreathes, Iphigeneia! they belong To none but thee and her who reigns (Less chaunted) on our bosky plains. Semi-chorus. Iphigeneia! 'tis to thee Glory we owe and victory. Clash, men of Argos, clash your arms, To martial worth and virgin charms. Other Semi-chorus. Ye men of Argos! it was sweet To roll the fruits of conquest at the feet Whose whispering sound made bravest hearts beat fast. This we have known at home; But hither we are come To crown the king who ruled us first and last. Chorus. Father of Argos! king of men! We chaunt the hymn of praise to thee. In serried ranks we stand again, Our glory safe, our country free. Clash, clash the arms we bravely bore Against Scamander's God-defended shore. Semi-chorus. Blessed art thou who hast repell'd Battle's wild fury, Ocean's whelming foam; Blessed o'er all, to have beheld Wife, children, house avenged, and peaceful home! Other Semi-chorus. We, too, thou seest, are now Among the happy, though the aged brow From sorrow for us we could not protect, Nor, on the polisht granite of the well Folding our arms, of spoils and perils tell, Nor lift the vase on the lov'd head erect. Semi-chorus. What whirling wheels are those behind? What plumes come flaring through the wind, Nearer and nearer? From his car He who defied the heaven-born Powers of war Pelides springs! Dust, dust are we To him, O king, who bends the knee, Proud only to be first in reverent praise of thee. Other Semi-chorus. Clash, clash the arms! None other race Shall see such heroes face to face. We too have fought; and they have seen Nor sea-sand grey nor meadow green Where Dardans stood against their men . . Clash! Io Pæan! clash again! Repinings for lost days repress . . The flames of Troy had cheer'd us less. Chorus. Hark! from afar more war-steeds neigh, Thousands o'er thousands rush this way. Ajax is yonder! ay, behold The radiant arms of Lycian gold! Arms from admiring valour won, Tydeus! and worthy of thy son. 'Tis Ajax wears them now; for he Rules over Adria's stormy sea. He threw them to the friend who lost (By the dim judgment of the host) Those wet with tears which Thetis gave The youth most beauteous of the brave. In vain! the insatiate soul would go For comfort to his peers below. Clash! ere we leave them all the plain, Clash! Io Pæan! once again! THE DEATH OF CLYTEMNESTRA. Orestes and Electra. Electra. Pass on, my brother! she awaits the wretch, Dishonorer, despoiler, murderer. . . None other name shall name him. . . she awaits As would a lover. Heavenly Gods. . . what poison O'erflows my lips! . . . Adultress! husband-slayer. Strike her, the tigress! Think upon our father. . . Give the sword scope . . think what a man was he. How fond of her! how kind to all about, That he might gladden and teach us . . how proud Of thee, Orestes tossing thee above His joyous head and calling thee his crown. Ah! boys remember not what melts our hearts And marks them evermore! Bite not thy lip, Nor tramp as an unsteady colt the ground, Nor stare against the wall, but think again How better than all fathers was our father. Go. . . Orestes. Loose me then! for this white hand Electra Hath fastened upon mine with fiercer grasp Than mine can grasp the sword. Electra. Go, sweet Orestes! I knew not I was holding thee. . . Avenge him! (Alone.) How he sprang from me! . . Sure, he now has reacht The room before the bath. . . The bath door creaks! . . It hath creakt thus since he . . since thou, O father! Ever since thou didst loosen its strong valves Either with all thy dying weight or strength Agonised with her stabs. . . What plunge was that? Ah me! . . What groans are those? Orestes. (Returning.) They sound through hell, Rejoicing the Eumenides. She slew Our father: she made thee the scorn of slaves; Me (son of him who ruled this land and more) She made an outcast. . Would I had been so For ever! ere such vengeance. . . Electra. O that Zeus Had let thy arm fall sooner at thy side Without those drops! list! they are audible, For they are many . . from the sword's point falling And down from the mid blade! Too rash Orestes! Couldst thou not then have spared our wretched mother? Orestes. The Gods could not. Electra. She was not theirs, Orestes. Orestes. And didst not thou. . . Electra. 'Twas I, 'twas I, who did it; Of our unhappiest house the most unhappy! Under this roof, by every God accursed, There is no grief, there is no guilt, but mine. Orestes. Electra! no! 'Tis now my time to suffer. . Mine be, with all its pangs, the righteous deed. THE MADNESS OF ORESTES. Orestes and Electra. Orestes. Heavy and murderous dreams, O my Electra, Have dragged me from myself. Is this Mycenai? Are we . . are all who should be in our house? Living? unhurt? our father here? our mother? Why that deep gasp? for 'twas not sigh nor groan. She then . . . 'twas she who fell! when? How? Beware! No, no, speak out at once, that my full heart May meet it, and may share with thee in all . . In all . . . but that one thing. It was a dream. We may share all. They live? both live? O say it! Electra. The Gods have placed them from us, and there rolls Between us that dark river . . . Orestes. Blood! blood! blood! I see it roll; I see the hand above it, Imploring; I see her. Hiss me not back, Ye snake-hair'd maids! I will look on; I will Hear the words gurgle thro' that cursed stream, And catch that hand . . that hand . . . which slew my father! It can not be . . . . how could it slay my father? Death to the slave who spoke it! . . . slay my father! It tost me up to him to earn a smile, And was a smile then such a precious boon, And royal state and proud affection nothing? Ay, and thee too, Electra, she once taught To take the sceptre from him at the door . . . Not the bath-door, not the bath-door, mind that! And place it in the vestibule, against The spear of Pallas, where it used to stand. Where is it now? methinks I missed it there. How we have trembled to be seen to move it! Both looking up, lest that stern face should frown Which always gazed on Zeus right opposite. O! could but one tear more fall from my eyes, It would shake off these horrid visages, And melt them into air. I am not yours, Fell Goddesses! A just and generous power, A bright-hair'd God directed me. And thus Abased is he whom such a God inspired! [After a pause. Into whose kingdom went they? did they go Together? Electra. Oh! they were not long apart. Orestes. I know why thou art pale; I know whose head Thy flower-like hands have garlanded; I know For whom thou hast unbraided all thy love. He well deserves it . . He shall have it all. Glory and love shall crown thee, my brave sister! Electra. I am not she of Sparta. Let me live (If live I must, Orestes!) not unnamed Nor named too often . . speak no more of love, Ill-omened and opprobrious in this house . . A mother should have had, a father had it, O may a brother let it dwell with him, Unchangeable, unquestioned, solitary, Strengthened and hallowed in the depths of grief! Gaze not so angrily . . I dare not see thee, I dare not look where comfort should be found. Orestes. I dare and do behold them all day long, And, were that face away so like my mother's, I would advance and question and compel them . . They hear me and they know it. Electra. Hear me too, Ye mighty ones! To me invisible! And spare him! spare him! for without the Gods He wrought not what he wrought: And are not ye Partakers of their counsels and their power? O spare the son of him whom ye and they Sent against Ilion, to perform your will And bid the rulers of the earth be just. Orestes. And dare they frighten thee too? frighten thee? And bend thee into prayer? Off, hateful eyes! Look upon me, not her. Ay, thus; 'tis well. Cheer, cheer thee, my Electra. I am strong, Stronger than ever . . steel, fire, adamant . . But cannot bear thy brow upon my neck. Can not bear these wild writhings, these loud sobs. By all the Gods! I think thou art half mad. . . I must away . . follow me not . . stand there! THE PRAYER OF ORESTES. Orestes. O King Apollo! God Apollo! god Powerful to smite and powerful to preserve! If there is blood upon me, as there seems, Purify that black stain (thou only canst) With every rill that bubbles from these caves Audibly; and come willing to the work. No; 'tis not they; 'tis blood; 'tis blood again That bubbles in my ear, that shakes the shades Of thy dark groves, and lets in hateful gleams, Bringing me . . What dread sight! What sound abhorr'd! What screams! They are my mother's: 'Tis her eye That through the snakes of those three furies glares, And makes them hold their peace that she may speak. Has thy voice bidden them all forth? they slink, Some that would hide away, but must turn back, And others like blue lightnings bound along From rock to rock; and many hiss at me As they draw nearer. Earth, fire, water, all Abominate the deed of Gods commanded. Alas! I came to pray, not to complain; And lo! my speech is impious as my deed! THE PRIESTESS OF APOLLO. Take refuge here amid our Delphian shades, O troubled breast! Here the most pious of Mycenai's maids Shall watch thy rest And wave the cooling laurel o'er thy brow, Nor insects swarm Shall ever break thy slumbers, nor shalt thou Start at the alarm Of boys infesting (as they do) the street With mocking songs, Stopping and importuning all they meet, And heaping wrongs Upon thy diadem'd and sacred head, Worse than when base Œgisthus (shudder not!) his toils outspread Around thy race. Altho' even in this fane the fitful blast Thou may'st hear roar, Thy name among our highest rocks shall last For ever more. Orestes. A calm comes over me: life brings it not With any of its tides: my end is near. O Priestess of the purifying god Receive her (pointing to his sister), and when she hath closed mine eyes, Do thou (weep not, my father's child!) close hers. WALTER TYRREL AND WILLIAM RUFUS. Rufus. Tyrrel, spur onward! we must not await The laggard lords: when they have heard the dogs I warrant they will follow fast enough, Each for his haunch. Thy roan is mettlesome; How the rogue sides up to me, and claims Acquaintance with young Yorkshire! not afraid Of wrinkling lip, nor ear laid down like grass By summer thunder-shower on Windsor mead. Tyrrel. Behold, my liege! hither they troop amain, Over yon gap. Rufus. Over my pales? the dolts Have broken down my pales! Tyrrel. Please you, my liege, Unless they had, they must have ridden round Eleven miles. Rufus. Why not have ridden round Eleven miles? or twenty, were there need. By our Lady! they shall be our carpenters And mend what they have marr'd. At any time I can make fifty lords; but who can make As many head of deer, if mine escape? And sure they will, unless they too are mad. Call me that bishop . . him with hunting-cap Surcharged with cross, and scarlet above knee. Tyrrel (galloping forward.) Ho! my lord bishop! Bishop. Who calls me? Tyrrel. Your slave. Bishop. Well said, if toned as well and timed as well. Who art thou? citizen or hind? what wantest? Tyrrel. My lord; your presence; but before the king; Where it may grow more placid at its leisure. The morn is only streakt with red, my lord! You beat her out and out: how prettily You wear your stocking over head and ears! Keep off the gorse and broom! they soon catch fire! Bishop. The king shall hear of this: I recognise Sir Walter Tyrrel. Tyrrel. And Sir Walter Tyrrel By the same token duly recognises The Church's well-begotten son, well-fed, Well-mounted, and all well, except well-spoken, The spiritual lord of Winchester. Bishop. Ay, by God's grace! pert losel! Tyrrel. Prick along Lord bishop! quicker! catch fresh air! we want it; We have had foul enough till dinner-time. Bishop. Varlet! I may chastise this insolence. Tyrrel. I like those feathers: but there crows no cock Without an answer. Though the noisiest throat Sings from the belfrey of snug Winchester, Yet he from Westminster hath stouter spurs. Bishop. God's blood! were I no bishop . . Tyrrel. Then thy own Were cooler. Bishop. Whip that hound aside! O Christ! The beast has paw'd my housings! What a day For dirt! Tyrrel. The scent lies well; pity no more The housings; look, my lord! here trots the king! Rufus. Which of you broke my palings down? Bishop. God knows, Most gracious sir. Rufus. No doubt he does; but you, Bishop! could surely teach us what God knows. Ride back and order some score handicrafts To fix them in their places. Bishop. The command Of our most gracious king shall be obeyed. [Riding off. Malisons on the atheist! Who can tell Where are my squires and other men? confused Among the servitors of temporal lords! I must e'en turn again and hail that brute. Sir Walter! good Sir Walter! one half-word! [Tyrrel rides toward him. Sir Walter! may I task your courtesy To find me any of my followers? Tyrrel. Willingly. Rufus. Stay with me; I want thee, Tyrrel! What does the bishop bogle at? Tyrrel. At nothing. He seeks his people, to retrieve the damage. Rufus. Where are the lords? Tyrrel. Gone past your grace, bare-headed, And falling in the rear. Rufus. Well, prick then on. I care but little for the chase to-day, Although the scent lies sweetly. To knock down My paling is vexatious. We must see Our great improvements in this forest; what Of roads blockt up, of hamlets swept away, Of lurking dens called cottages, and cells, And hermitages. Tyrrel! thou didst right And dutifully, to remove the house Of thy forefathers. 'Twas an odd request To leave the dovecote for the sake of those Flea-bitten blind old pigeons. There it stands! But, in God's name! what mean these hives? the bees May sting my dogs. Tyrrel. They hunt not in the summer. Rufus. They may torment my fawns. Tyrrel. Sir, not unless Driven from their hives: they like the flowers much better. Rufus. Flowers! and leave flowers too! Tyrrel. Only some half-wild, In tangled knots; balm, clary, marjoram. Rufus. What lies beyond this close briar hedge, that smells Through the thick dew upon it, pleasantly? Tyrrel. A poor low cottage: the dry marl-pit shields it, And, frail and unsupported like itself, Peace-breathing honeysuckles comfort it In its misfortunes. Rufus. I am fain to laugh At thy rank minstrelsy. A poor low cottage! Only a poor low cottage! where, I ween, A poor low maiden blesses Walter Tyrrel. Tyrrel. It may be so. Rufus. No; it may not be so. My orders were that all should be removed; And, out of special favour, special trust In thee, Sir Walter, I consign'd the care Into thy own hands, of razing thy own house And those about it; since thou hast another Fairer and newer, and more lands around. Tyrrel. Hall, chapel, chamber, cellar, turret, grange, Are level with the grass. Rufus. What negligence To leave the work then incomplete, when little Was there remaining! Strip that roof, and start Thy petty game from cover. Tyrrel. O my liege! Command not this! Rufus. Make me no confidant Of thy base loves. Tyrrel. Nor you, my liege! nor any: None such hath Walter Tyrrel. Rufus. Thou 'rt at bay; Thou hast forgotten thy avowal, man! Tyrrel. My father's house is (like my father) gone: But in that house, and from that father's heart Mine grew into his likeness, and held thence Its rich possessions . . God forgive my boast! He bade me help the needy, raise the low . . Rufus. And stand against thy king! Tyrrel. How many yokes Of oxen, from how many villages For miles around, brought I, at my own charge, To bear away the rafters and the beams That were above my cradle at my birth, And rang when I was christened, to the carouse Of that glad father and his loyal friends! Rufus. He kept good cheer, they tell me. Tyrrel. Yonder thatch Covers the worn-out woman at whose breast I hung, an infant. Rufus. Ay! and none beside? Tyrrel. Four sons have fallen in the wars. Rufus. Brave dogs! Tyrrel. She hath none left. Rufus. No daughter! Tyrrel. One. Rufus. I thought it. Unkennel her. Tyrrel. Grace! pity! mercy on her! Rufus. I will not have hot scents about my chase. Tyrrel. A virtuous daughter of a virtuous mother Deserves not this, my liege! Rufus. Am I to learn What any subject at my hand deserves? Tyrrel. Happy, who dares to teach it, and who can! Rufus. And thou, forsooth! Tyrrel. I have done my duty, sire! Rufus. Not half: perform the rest, or bide my wrath. Tyrrel. What, break athwart my knee the staff of age? Rufus. Question me, villain! Tyrrel. Villain I am none. Rufus. Retort my words! By all the saints! thou diest, False traitor! Tyrrel. Sire, no private wrong, no word Spoken in angriness, no threat against My life or honour, urge me . . Rufus. Urge to what? Dismountest? Tyrrel. On my knees, as best beseems, I ask . . not pardon, sire! but spare, oh spare The child devoted, the deserted mother! Rufus. Take her; take both. Tyrrel. She loves her home; her limbs Fail her; her husband sleeps in that churchyard; Her youngest child, born many years the last, Lies (not half-length) along the father's coffin. Such separate love grows stronger in the stem (I have heard say) than others close together, And that, where pass these funerals, all life's spring Vanishes from behind them, all the fruits Of riper age are shrivel'd, every sheaf Husky; no gleaning left. She would die here, Where from her bed she looks on his; no more Able to rise, poor little soul! than he. Rufus. Who would disturb them, child or father? where Is the churchyard thou speakest of? Tyrrel. Among Yon nettles: we have level'd all the graves. Rufus. Right: or our horses might have stumbled on them. Tyrrel. Your grace oft spares the guilty; spare the innocent! Rufus. Up from the dew! thy voice is hoarse already. Tyrrel. Yet God hath heard it. It entreats again, Once more, once only; spare this wretched house. Rufus. No, nor thee neither. Tyrrel. Speed me, God! and judge O thou! between the oppressor and opprest! [He pierces Rufus with an arrow. THE PARENTS OF LUTHER. John Luther. I left thee, Margaretta, fast asleep, Thou, who wert always earlier than myself, Yet hast no mine to trudge to, hast no wedge To sharpen at the forge, no pickaxe loose In handle. Come, blush not again: thy cheeks May now shake off those blossoms which they bore So thick this morning that last night's avowal Nestles among them still. So, in few months A noisier bird partakes our whispering bower? Say it again. Margaretta. And, in my dream, I blush'd! John. Idler! wert dreaming too? and after dawn? Marg. In truth was I. John. Of me? Marg. No, not of you. John. No matter; for methinks some Seraph's wing Fann'd that bright countenance. Marg. Methinks it did. And stir'd my soul within. How could you go And never say good-bye, and give no kiss? John. It might have waken'd thee. I can give more Kisses than sleep: so thinking, I heav'd up Slowly my elbow from above the pillow, And, when I saw it woke thee not, went forth. Marg. I would have been awaken'd for a kiss, And a good-bye, or either, if not both. John. Thy dreams were not worth much then. Marg. Few dreams are; But . . John. By my troth! I will intrench upon The woman's dowry, and will contradict, Tho' I should never contradict again. I have got more from dreams a hundred-fold Than all the solid earth, than field, than town, Than (the close niggard purse that cramps my fist) The mine will ever bring me. Marg. So have I, And so shall each indeed, if this be true. John. What was it then? for when good dreams befall The true of heart, 'tis likely they come true. A vein of gold? ay? silver? copper? iron? Lead? sulphur? alum? alabaster? coal? Shake not those ringlets nor let down those eyes, Tho' they look prettier for it, but speak out. True, these are not thy dainties. Marg. Guess again. John. Crystalline kitchens, amber-basted spits, Whizzing with frothy savory salamanders, And swans that might (so plump and pleasant-looking) Swim in the water from the mouths of knights; And ostrich-eggs off coral woods (the nests Outside of cinnamon, inside of saffron, And mortar'd well, for safety-sake with myrrh), Serv'd up in fern-leaves green before the Flood? Marg. Stuff! you will never guess it, I am sure. John. No? and yet these are well worth dreaming of. Marg. Try once again. John. Faith! it is kind to let me. Under-ground beer-cascades from Nuremberg? Rhine vintage stealing from Electoral cellars, And, broader than sea-baths for mermaid brides, With fluits upon the surface strides across, Pink conchs, to catch it and to light it down; And music from basaltic organ-pipes For dancing; and five fairies to one man. Marg. Oh his wild fancies! . . Are they innocent? John. I think I must be near it by that shrug. Spicy sack-posset, roaring from hot springs And running off like mad thro' candied cliffs, But catching now and then some fruit that drops . . Shake thy head yet? why then thou hast the palsy. Zooks! I have thought of all things probable And come to my wits' end. What canst thou mean? Marg. Nay, I have half a mind now not to tell. John. Then it is out . . Thy whole one ill could hold it. A woman's mind hates pitch upon its seams. Marg. Hush! one word more, and then my lips are closed. John. Pish! one more word, and then my lips . . Marg. O rare Impudent man! . . and such discourse from you! I dreamt we had a boy . . John. A wench, a wench . . A boy were not like thee. Marg. I said a boy. John. Well, let us have him, if we miss the girl. Marg. My father told me he must have a boy, And call him Martin (his own name) because Saint Martin both was brave and cloth'd the poor. John. Hurrah then for Saint Martin! he shall have Enough to work on in this house of ours. Marg. Now do not laugh, dear husband! but this dream Seem'd somewhat more. John. So do all dreams, ere past. Marg. Well, but it seems so still. John. Ay, twist my fingers, Basketing them to hold it. Marg. Never grave! John. I shall be. Marg. That one thought should make you now. John. And that one tap upon the cheek to boot. Marg. I do believe, if you were call'd to Heaven You would stay toying here. John. I doubt I should. Methinks I set my back against the gate Thrown open to me by this rosy hand, And look both ways, but see more heaven than earth: Give me thy dream: thou puttest it aside: I must be feasted: fetch it forth at once. Marg. Husband! I dreamt the child was in my arms, And held a sword, which from its little grasp I could not move, nor you: I dreamt that proud But tottering shapes in purple filigree Pull'd at it, and he laught. John. They frighten'd thee? Marg. Frighten'd me! no: the infant's strength prevail'd. Devils, with angels' faces, throng'd about; Some offer'd flowers, and some held cups behind, And some held daggers under silken stoles. John. These frighten'd thee, however. Marg. He knew all; I knew he did. John. A dream! a dream indeed! He knew and laught! Marg. He sought his mother's breast, And lookt at them no longer. All the room Was fill'd with light and gladness. John. He shall be Richer than we are; he shall mount his horse . . A feat above his father; and be one Of the duke's spearmen. Marg. God forbid! they lead Unrighteous lives, and often fall untimely. John. A lion-hearted lad shall Martin be. Marg. God willing; if his servant; but not else. I have such hopes, full hopes, hopes overflowing. John. A grave grand man, half collar and half cross, With chain enough to hold our mastiff by, Thou fain wouldst have him. Out of dirt so stiff Old Satan fashioneth his idol, Pride. Marg. If proud and cruel to the weak, and bent To turn all blessings from their even course To his own kind and company, may he Never be great, with collar, cross, and chain; No, nor be ever angel, if, O God! He be a fallen angel at the last. [After a pause. Uncle, you know, is sacristan; and uncle Had once an uncle who was parish priest. John. He was the man who sung so merrily Those verses which few scholars understand, Yet which they can not hide away, nor drive The man from memory after forty years. Marg. (sings). “Our brightest pleasures are reflected pleasures. And they shine sweetest from the cottage-wall.” John. The very same. Marg. We understand them, John! John. An inkling. But your uncle sacristan Hath neither sword nor spur. Marg. It was a sword, A flaming sword, but innocent, I saw; And I have seen in pictures such as that, And in the hands of angels borne on clouds. He may defend our faith, drive out the Turk, And quench the crescent in the Danaw stream. John. Thou, who begannest softly, singest now Shrill as a throstle. Marg. Have we then no cause To sing as throstles after sign thus strange? John. Because it was so strange, must we believe The rather? Marg. Yes; no fire was in the house, No splinter, not a spark. The Virgin's chin Shone not with rushlight under it; 'twas out. For night was almost over, if not past, And the Count's chapel has not half that blaze On the Count's birthday, nor the hall at night. Ah surely, surely fare like ours sends up No idle fumes; nor wish nor hope of mine Fashion'd so bright a substance to a form So beautiful. There must be truth in it. John. There shall be then. Your uncle's sacristy Shall hold the armour quite invisible, Until our little Martin some fine day Bursts the door open, spurr'd, caparison'd, Dukes lead his bridle, princes tramp behind. He may be pope . . who knows? Marg. Are you in earnest? But if he should be pope, will he love us? Or let us (O yes, sure he would!) love him? Nor slink away, ashamed? Pope, no; not pope, But bishop (ay?) he may be? There are few Powerfuller folks than uncle Grimmermann. Promise he scarce would give us, but a wink Of hope he gave, to make a chorister. John. “If thou wilt find materials,” were his words. Marg. I did not not mark the words; they were too light: And yet he never breaks his troth. John. Not he: No, he would rather break his fast ten times. Do not look seriously . . when church allows, I mean; no more; six days a week; not seven. I have seen houses where the Friday cheese Was not (in my mind) cut with Thursday knife. Marg. O now for shame! such houses can not stand. Pr'ythee talk reason. As the furnace-mouth Shows only fire, so yours shows laughter only. Choristers have been friars; ours may be; And then a father abbot. John. At one leap, As salmon up Schaffhausen. Marg. Just the same . . Then . . John. Ring the bells! Martin is pope, by Jove! ANDREA OF HUNGARY, GIOVANNA OF NAPLES, AND FRA RUPERT: A TRILOGY. ANDREA OF HUNGARY. CHARACTERS. Andrea. Fra Rupert.

My verse was for thine eyes alone, Alone by them was it repaid; And still thine ear records the tone Of thy grey minstrel, thoughtful maid! Amid the pomps of regal state, Where thou, O Rose! art call'd to move, Thee only Virtue can elate, She only guide thy steps to Love. Sometimes, when dark is each saloon, Dark every lamp that crown'd the Seine, Memory hangs low Amalfi's moon And lights thee o'er Salerno's plain. And onward, where Giovanna bore Keen anguish from envenom'd tongues: Her fame my pages shall restore, Thy pity shall requite her wrongs. ACT I. SCENE I. PALACE AT NAPLES. Andrea and Giovanna. Andrea. What say you now, Giovanna! shall we go And conquer France? Heigho? I am sadly idle; My mighty mind wants full activity. Giovanna. Andrea! be contented; stay at home; Conquer? you've conquer'd me. Andrea. Ah rebel queen! I doubt it: we have had war first, however, And parleys, and all that. Giovanna. You might have more Before you conquer the strong cities there. Andrea. England, they tell me, hath as much of France As France hath. Some imagine that Provenza Is half-and-half French land. How this may be I can not tell; I am no theologian. Giovanna . . in your ear . . I have a mind To ride to Paris, and salute the king, And pull him by the beard, and make him fight. Giovanna. Know that French beards have stiffer hairs than German, And crackle into flame at the first touch. Andrea. 'Sblood! like black cats! But only in the dark? Giovanna. By night or day, in city or in field. Andrea. I never knew it: let the Devil lug them For me then! they are fitter for his fist. Sure, of all idle days the marriage-day Is idlest: even the common people run About the streets, not knowing what to do, As if they came from wedding too, poor souls! This fancy set me upon conquering France. Giovanna. And one hour only after we are united? SCENE II. Maria enters. Andrea. Maria! where are you for? France or Naples? She heard, she smiled . . Here's whispering . . This won't do . . [Going; but stops, pacified. She may have secrets . . they all have . . I'll leave 'em. Giovanna. Unsisterly! unfriendly! [Goes. Maria. Peace! Giovanna! Giovanna. That word has sign'd it. I have sworn to love him. Maria. Ah, what a vow! Giovanna. The harder to perform The greater were the glory: I will earn it. Maria. How can we love . . Giovanna (interrupting). Mainly, by hearing none Decry the object; then, by cherishing The good we see in it, and overlooking What is less pleasant in the paths of life. All have some virtue if we leave it them In peace and quiet; all may lose some part By sifting too minutely bad and good. The tenderer and the timider of creatures Often desert the brood that has been handled And turn'd about, or indiscreetly lookt at. The slightest touches, touching constantly, Irritate and inflame. Maria. Giovanna mine! These rhetoric-roses are supremely sweet, But hold! the jar is full. I promise you I will not steal up with a mind to snatch, Or pry too closely where you bid me not . . But for the nest you talk about . . Giovanna. For shame! What nest? Maria. That nest your blushes gleam upon. O! I will watch each twig, each feather there, And, if my turning, tossing, hugging, does it, Woe to Giovanna's little bird, say I. Giovanna. Seriously, my sweet sister! Maria (interrupting). Seriously Indeed! What briars ere we come to that! Giovanna. I am accustomed to Andrea's ways, And see much good in him. Maria. I see it too. Giovanna. Fix upon that your eyes; they will grow brighter, Maria, for each beauty they discover. SCENE III. ANOTHER ROOM IN THE PALACE. Andrea, Fra Rupert. Andrea. Well met again, Fra Rupert! Why not, though, At church with us? By this humility You lost the prettiest sight that ever was. Fra Rupert. I know what such sights are. Andrea. What? Fra Rupert. Vanity. Andrea. Exact the thing that everybody likes. Fra Rupert. You young and heedless! Andrea. We pass lightly over, And run on merrily quite to the end; The graver stumble, break their knees, and curse it: Which are the wiser? Had you seen the church! The finest lady ever drest for court A week-day peasant to her! By to-morrow There's not a leg of all the crowd in Naples But will stand stiff and ache with this day's tiptoe; There's not a throat will drop its paste-tape down Without some soreness from such roaring cheers; There's not a husband but whose ears will tingle Under his consort's claw this blessed night For sighing “What an angel is Giovanna!” Fra Rupert. Go, go! I can not hear such ribaldry. Andrea. Rather should you have heard, as there you might, Quarrelsome blunder-headed drums, o'erpower'd By pelting cymbals; then complaining flutes, And boy-voiced fifes, lively and smart and shrill; Then timbrels, where tall fingers trip, but trip In the right place, and run along again; Then blustering trumpets, wonder-wafting horns, Evvivas from their folks, hurrahs from ours, And songs that pour into both ears long life And floods of glory and victory for ever. Fra Rupert. What signify these fooleries? In one word, Andrea, art thou king? Andrea. I fancy so. The people never give such hearty shouts Saving for kings and blunders. Fra Rupert. Son! beware, Lest while they make the one they make the other. Andrea. How must I guard against it? Fra Rupert. Twelve whole years Constantly here together, all the time Since we left Hungary, and not one day But I have labour'd to instil into thee, Andrea! how wise kings must feel and act. Andrea. But, father, who let you into the secret? Fra Rupert. I learnt it in the cloister. Andrea. Then no doubt The secret is worth knowing; many are (Or songs and fables equally are false) Among those whisper'd there. Fra Rupert. Methinks, my son, Such words are lighter than beseems crown'd heads, As thine should be, and shall be, if thou wilt. Andrea. Ay, father, but it is not so as yet; Else would it jingle to another crown, With what a face beneath it! What a girl Is our Giovanna! Fra Rupert. By the saints above! I thought it was a queen, and not a girl. Andrea. There is enough in her for both at once. A queen it shall be then the whole day long. [Fra Rupert, impatient. Nay, not a word, good Frate! the whole day; Ave-Maria ends it; does it not? I am so glad, so gamesome, so light-hearted, So fond, I (sure!) am long steps off the throne. Fra Rupert. And ever may'st be, if thou art remiss In claiming it. Andrea. I can get anything From my Giovanna. You would hardly guess What she has given me. Look here! Fra Rupert. A book? Andrea. ‘King Solomon.’ Fra Rupert. His Song? To seculars? I warrant she would teach it, and thou learn it. Andra. I'll learn it through, I'll learn it every verse. Where does the Song begin? I see no rhymes. Fra Rupert. ‘The Proverbs!’ Not so bad! Andrea. Are songs then proverbs? And what is this hard word? Fra Rupert. ‘Ecclesiastes.’ Andrea. But look! you have not seen the best of it. What pretty pictures! what broad rubies! what Prodigious pearls! seas seem to roll within, And azure skies, as ever bent above, Push their pink clouds, half-shy, to mingle with 'em. Fra Rupert. I am not sure this book would do thee harm, But better let me first examine it. [He takes it. Andrea. You shall not have it; give it me again. Fra Rupert. Loose it, I say, Andrea! Andrea. I say no! Fra Rupert. To me? Andrea. Dost think I'd say it to Giovanna? Beside, she gave it me: she has read in it With her own eyes, has written Latin in it With her own fingers, . . for who else could write Distinctly such small letters? . . You yourself, Who rarely have occasion for much Latin, Might swear them to be Latin in ten minutes. Another thing . . the selfsame perfume clings About those pages as about her bosom. Fra Rupert (starts). Abomination! Know all that! Andrea. Like matins. Thence, tho' she turn'd quite round, I saw her take it To give it me. Another thing . . the people Bragg'd of my metal half an hour ago, And I will show I have it, like the best. Another thing . . forgettest thou, Fra Rupert, I am a husband? Fra Rupert. Seven years old thou wert one. Andrea. Ha, but! ha, but! seven years upon seven years Could not make me the man I am to-day. Fra Rupert. Nor seventy upon seven a tittle wiser. Andrea. Why did not you then make me while you could? You taught me nothing, and would let none touch me, No, not our king himself, the wisest man In his dominions, nor more wise than willing. Forsooth! you made a promise to my father That nobody should filch my faith and morals, No taint of learning eat skin-deep into me! And good king Robert said, “If thus my brother Must have it . . if such promise was exacted . .” Fra Rupert. All have more knowledge than they well employ. Upbraidest thou thy teacher, guardian, father? Andrea. Fathers may be, alas! too distant from us, Guardians may be too close . . but, teacher? teacher? Fra Rupert. Silence! Andrea (retreating). He daunts me: yet, some day, cospetto! Fra Rupert. What mutterest thou? Andrea (to himself). I will be brave, please God! Fra Rupert (suppressing rage). Obstinate sinners are alone unpardon'd: I may forgive thee after meet repentance, But must confer with thee another time On that refractory untoward spirit. Andrea (to himself). He was then in the right (it seems) at last. Fra Rupert. I hear some footsteps coming hitherward. SCENE IV. Giovanna and Filippa. Fra Rupert (turns his back to them). O those pestiferous women! Andrea. Ay, well spoken. The most religious of religious men Lifts up his arms and eyes, my sweet Giovanna, Before your wond'rous charms. [The Friar looks at him with rage and scorn. Giovanna. Simple Andrea! Are they more wond'rous than they were before? Or are they more apparent now the robes Are laid aside, and all those gems that made My hair stand back, chiefly that mischievous Malignant ruby (some fierce dragon's eye Turn'd into stone) which hurt your finger so With its vile crooked pin, for touching me, When you should have but lookt, and not quite that. Fra Rupert. (who had listened). Come hither; didst thou hear her? Andrea. Every word; And bear no rancour to her, though she scolds. Fra Rupert. She might have waited twenty years beyond This day, before she thought of matrimony; She talks so like a simpleton. Andrea. She does Indeed: yet, father! it is very true: The pin did prick me: she is no simpleton As far as memory goes. [The Friar looks up, then walks about impatiently. Now, won't you mind me? She is but very young, scarce seventeen; When she is two years older, just my age, Then shall you see her! more like me perhaps. She might have waited . . . you say well . . . and would Willingly, I do think; but I am wiser, And warmer. Our Hungarian blood (ay, Frate!) Is not squeez'd out of March anemones. Filippa. Since, friar Rupert! here are met together The lofty and the lowly, they and we, If your austerity of life forbade To mingle with the world's festivities, Indulge, I pray you, in that luxury Which suits all seasons, sets no day apart, Excludes from its communion none, howe'er Unworthy, but partakes of God indeed . . Indulge in pardon. Fra Rupert. Does a seneschal's Wife bend before me? Do the proud ones beg? Filippa. Too proud I may be: even the very humblest May be too proud. I am, 'tis true, the widow Of him you mention. Do I beg? I do. Our queen commands me to remove ill-will. Fra Rupert. There are commands above the queen's. Filippa. There are, O holy man! obey we both at once! Giovanna (calls Andrea). Husband! Fra Rupert. And not our king? most noble lady! Giovanna. He, or I much mistake him, is my husband. Andrea. Mistake me! not a whit: I am, I am. Giovanna. If, O my husband! that dear name has power On your heart as on mine, now when first spoken, Let what is love between us shed its sweets A little wider, tho' a little fainter; Let all our friends this day, all yours, all mine, Be one another's, and not this day only. Persuade them. Andrea. Can I? Giovanna. You persuaded me. Andrea. Ay, but you did not hate me; and your head Is neither grey nor tonsured; these are odds. I never could imagine well how folks Who disagree in other things, agree To make each other angry. What a game! To toss back burs until the skin is full On either side! Which wins the stake, I wonder? Fra Rupert (bursting away). I have no patience. Andrea. I have, now he's gone. How long were you contriving this grand scheme To drive away the friar? Do you think [Whispers to Giovanna. He won't come after supper? Does he know Our chamber? Giovanna. Hush! Andrea! Andrea. In good earnest I fear him, and the fleas about his frock. Let me go after him: he went in wrath: He may do mischief, if he thinks it right, As these religious people often do. [Andrea goes. Filippa. Happy Andrea! only fleas and friars Molest him: little he suspects the snares About his paths; the bitter jealousies Of Hungary; how pertinaciously Mail'd hands grasp sceptres, how reluctantly Loose them; how tempting are our milder clime And gentler nation! He deserves our pity. Giovanna. O! more than pity. If our clime, our nation, Bland, constant, kind, congenial with each other, Were granted him, how much more was withheld! Sterile the soil is not, but sadly waste. What buoyant spirits and what pliant temper! How patient of reproof! how he wipes off All injuries before they harden on him, And wonders at affronts, and doubts they can be! Then, his wild quickness! O the churl that bent it Into the earth, colourless, shapeless, thriftless, Fruitless, for ever! Had he been my brother, I should have wept all my life over him; But, being my husband, one hypocrisy I must put on, one only ever will I. Others must think, by my observance of him, I hold him prudent, penetrating, firm, No less than virtuous: I must place myself In my own house (now indeed his) below him. Filippa. I almost think you love him. Giovanna. He has few Even small faults, which small minds spy the soonest; He has, what those will never see nor heed, Wit of bright feather, but of broken wing; No stain of malice, none of spleen, about it. For this, and more things nearer . . . for the worst Of orphancy, the cruellest of frauds, Stealth of his education while he played Nor fancied he could want it; for our ties Of kindred; for our childhood spent together; For those dear faces that once smiled upon us At the same hour, in the same balcony; Even for the plants we rear'd in partnership, Or spoil'd in quarrel, I do love Andrea. But, from his counsellors! . . . Filippa. We shall elude Their clumsy wiles perhaps. The youth, methinks, Is tractable. Giovanna. May wise men guide him then! It lies beyond my duty. Filippa. But the wise Are not the men who guide the tractable. The first bold hand that seizes, holds them fast; And the best natures melt into the bad 'Mid dances and carousals. Giovanna. Let Andrea Be sparing of them! Filippa. Evil there may be Where evil men preside, but greatly worse Is proud austerity than princely glee. Giovanna. Heaven guard us! I have entered on a course Beleaguered with dense dangers: but that course Was first ordained in earth, and now in heaven. My father's spirit filled his father's breast, And peace and union in our family (They both foresaw) would be secured by ours. Filippa. She who forgets her parent will forego All later duties: yes, when love has lost The sound of its spring-head, it grows impure, Tortuous, and spent at last in barren sand. I owe these generous kings the bread I broke, The letters I pickt up: no vile sea-weed Had perisht more neglected, but for them. They would heap affluence on me; they did heap it; Next, honours: for these only I am ungrateful. Giovanna (smiling). Ungrateful? thou? Filippa! Filippa. Most ungrateful. With humble birth and humbler intellect The puff-ball might have bounced along the plain And blinded the beholder with its dust: But intellect let down on humble birth Writhes under titles, shrinks from every glance, At every question turns one fibre fresh For torture, and, unpullied and adrift, Burns its dull heart away in smouldering scorn. Giovanna. Where no ethereal spirit fills the breast . . Filippa. . . Honours are joys great as such breast can hold. Giovanna. The happy then in courts are numberless; We hear the contrary. Filippa. Never believe This, nor another ill report of them. Giovanna. What? Filippa. That the great are not great to their valets; 'Tis but their valets who can find their greatness. Giovanna. I know that you have enemies. Filippa. Thank God! I might have else forgotten what I am, And what he gave me ere he placed me here. Giovanna. I never shall, Filippa! Filippa. Think of those Who rais'd our souls above us, not of me. Giovanna. Oh! if my soul hath risen, if the throbs Of gratitude now tell it me, if they Who rais'd it must be thought of . . to my heart, Filippa! for the heart alone can think. Filippa. I first received thee in these arms; these arms Shall loose thee last of living things, Giovanna. ACT II. SCENE I. IN THE PALACE. Giovanna, Fiammetta, Maria. Maria. And now, Fiammetta, tell me whence that name Which tickles thee so. Fiammetta. Tell indeed! not I. Maria (to Giovanna). Sister! you may command Giovanna. Command a sister? Secrets are to be won, but not commanded. I never heard the name before. . Fiammetta . . Is that it? Maria. That is it. Fiammetta. For shame, Maria! Never will I entrust you with a secret. Maria. I do believe you like this one too well Ever to let another mingle with it. Fiammetta (to herself). I do indeed, alas! Giovanna. Some gallant knight Has carried off her scarf and bared her heart. But to this change of name I must withhold Assent, I like Maria so much better. Fiammetta (points to Maria). There is Maria yet. Giovanna. But where twin-roses Have grown so long together, to snap one Might make the other droop. Fiammetta. Ha! now, Maria! Maria! you are springed, my little quail! Giovanna. Fiammetta! if our father were here with us, He would suspect some poet friend of his, Dealer in flames and darts, their only trade, Enchanted his Sicilian. Maria. Ho! ho! ho! Proserpine never blusht such damask blushes When she was caught. Fiammetta. I am quite cool. Maria. The clouds May be quite cool when they are quite as red; Girls' faces, I suspect, are somewhat less so. [Fiammetta runs off. Giovanna. Maria! dear Maria! She is flown. Is the poor girl in love then? Maria. Till this hour I thought it but a fancy, such as all We children have: we all choose one; but, sure, To run out of the room at the mere shadow! Giovanna. What would you do? Maria. Wait till he came himself. Giovanna. And then? Maria. Think seriously of running off, Until I were persuaded it was civil. SCENE II. Andrea. What have ye done to little Sicily? She ran so swiftly by me, and pusht back My hand so smartly when I would have stopt her, I think you must have vext her plaguily Among you. Maria. She was vext, but not by us. Andrea. Yes, many girls are vext to-day. One bride Sheds fifty thorns from each white rose she wears. I did not think of that. (To Maria.) You did, no doubt? Maria. I wear white roses too, as well as she: Our queen's can have no thorns for us. Andrea. Not one? Maria. No, nor for any in this happy realm. Andrea. Ah now! this happy realm! Some people think That I could make it happier. Giovanna. I rejoice To hear it. Andrea. Are you glad, my little bride? Giovanna. Most glad. O never disappoint their hopes! The people are so kind! they love us so! Andrea. They are a merry race: ay, very crickets, Chirruping, leaping. What they eat, God knows; Sunshine and cinders, may be: he has sent Plenty of these, and they are satisfied. Giovanna. Should we be, if they are? Andrea. O then! a boon! To make them happy all their lives. Giovanna. The boon To make them happier Heaven alone can grant. Hearken! If some oppressions were removed, Beyond my strength to manage, it were done. Andrea. Nothing so easy. Not your strength indeed, But mine, could push a buffalo away. I have a little favour to request. Giovanna. Speak. Andrea. Give me then this kingdom, only this. I do not covet mountains to the north, Nor cities over cities farther west, Casal or Monferrato or Saluzzo, Asti or Coni, Ceva or Torino, Where that great river runs which spouts from heaven, Nor Aix nor Toulon, nor Marseille nor Nice Nor Avignon, where our good pope sits percht; I only want this tidy little kingdom, To make it happy with this sword upon it. Giovanna. The people and their laws alone can give it. Andrea. Well, we can make the laws. Giovanna. And people too? Andrea. Giovanna! I do think that smile could make A thousand peoples from the dullest clay, And mould them to thy will. Giovanna. Pure poetry! Andrea. Don't say it! or they knock me on the head! I ought to be contented: but they would Insist upon it. I have askt: here ends My duty: I don't want it for myself . . And yet those cities lookt like strings of bird-eggs, And tempted me above my strength. I only Repent of learning all their names for nothing. Let them hang where they are. Giovanna. Well said. Andrea. Who wants 'em? I like these pictures better. What a store! Songs, proverbs, and a word as hard as flint, Enough for fifty friars to ruminate Amid their cheese and cobnuts after dinner, Read it me. Giovanna. Which? [Andrea points. Giovanna. ‘Ecclesiastes.’ Andrea. Right! As you pronounce it, scarce a word of ours In Hungary is softer. What a tongue! Round, juicy, sweet, and soluble, as cherries. When Frate Rupert utter'd the same word, It sounded just as if his beard and breast, And all which there inhabit, had turn'd round Into his throat, to rasp and riddle it. I never shall forget Ecclesiastes! Only two words I know are pleasanter. Giovanna. And which are they? Andrea (saluting her). Giovanna and Carina. Maria. Unmanner'd prince! Andrea. Now the white rose sheds thorns. SCENE III. Sancia and Filippa. Sancia (smiling). Step-mothers are not always quite at home With their queen-daughters. Giovanna. Yet queen-mothers are. Step-mother you have never been to me, But kindest, fondest, tenderest, truest mother. Maria. Are we not all your children? Sancia. All. Where then Is fled our lively Sicily? Giovanna. She is gone To her own chamber. Maria. To read poetry. Sancia. Where poetry is only light or flattering She might read some things worse, and many better. I never loved the heroes of Romance, And hope they glide not in among the leaves. Maria. And love you then their contraries? Sancia. Those better. What clever speech, Maria, dost thou ponder? I see we differ. Maria. Rather. Sancia. Why so grave? Surely no spur is tangled in thy hem! Maria. No, my regrets were all for you. What pity Andrea dropt upon our globe too late; A puissant antipode to all such heroes! Giovanna (smiling). Intolerable girl! sad jealous creature! Sancia. Where is he? I was seeking him. Maria. There now! Sancia. Or else I should not have return'd so soon After our parting at the Benediction. [Goes. Maria. Sister! I fear my little flippancy Hurried Queen Sancia: why just now want sposo? Giovanna. She did not smile, as you do, when she went. Fond as she is, her smiles are faint this morning. A sorrowing thought, pure of all gloom, o'erspread That saintly face. Maria. It did indeed. Giovanna. She loves Us all, she loves our people too, most kindly. Maria. Seeing none other than Hungarian troops At church about us, deeply did she sigh And say “Ah! where are ours?” Giovanna. You pain me sadly. Queens, O Maria! have two hearts for sorrow; One sinks upon our Naples. Whensoever I gaze ('tis often) on her bay, so bright With sun-wove meshes, idle multitudes Of little plashing waves; when air breathes o'er it Mellow with sound and fragrance, of such purity That the blue hills seem coming nearer, nearer, As I look forth at them, and tossing down Joyance for joyance to the plains below . . To think what mannerless, unshorn, harsh-tongued Barbarians from the Danube and the Drave Infest them, I cast up my eyes to Heaven Impatiently, despondently, and ask Are such the guests for such festivities? But shall they dare enthral my poor Andrea? Send, send for him: I would not he were harm'd, Much less degraded. O for ministers To guide my counsels and protect my people! I would call round me all the good and wise. Sancia (returning). Daughter! no palace is too small to hold them. The good love other places, love the fields, And ripen the pale harvest with their prayers. Solitude, solitude, so dread a curse To princes, such a blight to sycophants, Is their own home, their healthy thoughts grow in it. The wise avoid all our anxieties: The cunning, with the tickets of the wise, Push for the banquet, seize each vacant chair, Gorge, pat their spaniel, and fall fast asleep. Giovanna. Ah then what vigils are reserved for me! Maria. Hark! spears are grounded. Giovanna. Officer! who comes? Officer. Lady! the friar mounts the stairs; behind him Those potent lords, Caraffa and Caraccioli. Giovanna. Your chair, Queen Sancia, stands unoccupied: We must be seated to receive the lords. Is it not so? Sancia. The queen must. Giovanna. One queen only? The younger first? we can not thus reverse The laws of nature for the whims of court. [Sancia is seated. There's our kind mother! Just in time! They come. SCENE IV. Fra Rupert, Caraffa, and Caraccioli. Lady! these nobles bring me with them hither, Fearing they might not win an audience On what concerns the welfare of the state, In such an hour of such a day as this. Giovanna. Speak, gentlemen! You have much wronged yourselves, And me a little, by such hesitation. No day, methinks, no hour, is half so proper, As when the crown is placed upon my brow, To hear what are its duties. Caraffa. Gracious queen! We come to represent . . Fra Rupert (behind). Speak out . . wrongs . . rights . . Religion. Caraffa (to him). You distract me. Fra Rupert (to Caraccioli). Speak then thou. See how attentively, how timidly, She waits for you, and blushes up your void! Caraccioli. 'Tis therefore I want words. Fra Rupert. Hear mine then, boys! [Walks toward Giovanna. Imprest with awe before such majesty, The hopes of Naples, whom their fathers deem On this occasion, this gay hour, from high Nobility, from splendour of equipments, Beauty of person, gracefulness of mien, And whatsoever courts are courtly by, Most fitted, and most likely to prevail Against those ancient frauds and artifices Which certain dark offenders weave about them . . These unsophisticated youths, foredoom'd Longest and most impatiently to suffer, Lay humbly at the footstool of your throne A list of grievances yet unredrest. Giovanna. Give it me, gentlemen, we will peruse it Together. Fra Rupert. They are more than scribe could pen. Giovanna (to Fra Rupert). Are they of native or imported growth? Your Reverence hath some practice in the sorting. Permit me to fill up your pause, Fra Rupert! On this occasion, this gay hour, methinks To urge impatience and foredoom of suffering Is quite untimely. High nobility And splendour of equipment are the last Of merits in Caraffas and Caracciolis [To them. The delicacy that deferr'd the tender Of your important service, I appreciate, Venturing to augur but a brief delay. Gentlemen! if your fathers bade you hither, I grieve to owe them more than I owe you, And trust, when next we see you, half the pleasure, Half, if not all, may be your own free gift. [She rises, they go. SCENE V. PALACE GARDEN. Fra Rupert, Caraffa, and Caraccioli. Fra Rupert. The losel! Caraccioli. Saints! what graciousness! Caraffa. Was ever So sweet a girl? He is uglier than old Satan, Andrea . . I abhor him worse than ever . . . Curse on that Tartar, Turk, Bohemian, Hungarian! I could now half-strangle him. Fra Rupert. We are dismist. Caraffa. My speech might have done wonders. Fra Rupert. Now, who (the mischief!) stops a dead man's blood? Wonders! ay truly, wonders it had done! Thou wert agape as money-box for mass, And wantedst shaking more. What are our gains? Caraffa. A vision the strain'd eyes can not inclose, Or bring again before them from the senses, Which clasp it, hang upon it, nor will ever Release it, following thro' eternity. Caraccioli. I can retain her image, hear her words, Repeat, and tone them on each fibre here, Distinctly still. Caraffa. Then hast thou neither heart Nor brain, Caraccioli! No strife so hard As to catch one slight sound, one faintest trace, Of the high beauty that rules over us. Who ever seized the harmony of heaven, Or saw the confine that is nearest earth? Fra Rupert. I can bear youthful follies, but must check The words that run thus wide and point at heaven. We must warn laymen fairly off that ground. Are ye both mad? Caraffa. One is; I swear to one: I would not be the man that is not so For empires girt with gold, worlds starr'd with women: A trance is that man's life, a dream be mine! Caraccioli's an ice-pit, covered o'er With straw and chaff and double-door'd and thatcht, And wall'd, the whole dark space, with earthen wall. Why! Frate! all those groans of thine for heaven? Art toucht? Fra Rupert. I have been praying fervently . . Despairingly I fear to say . . 'twere rash, Ungrateful, and ungodly. Caraffa. He has brought The whole Maremma on me at one breath. My cold fit now comes over me. But, Frate! If we do feel, may we not say we do? Fra Rupert. To feel is harm; to say it, may be none, Unless 'tis said with levity like thine. Caraffa. Ah faith! I wish 'twere levity! The pagan That heaves up Etna, calls it very differently. I think the dog is better off than I am; He groans upon the bed where lies his torment; I very far away from where lies mine. Fra Rupert. Art thou a Christian? Caraffa. Father! don't be serious. Fra Rupert. I must be. Caraffa. Have not I most cause? Fra Rupert. Yea truly. Caraffa. I am not over-given to complain, But nettles will sting all . . Fra Rupert. . . who put their hands in. Caraccioli! be warn'd by this our friend What sufferings may arise from lawless love. Thine passeth its due bounds; it doth, Caraccioli! But thou canst conquer every wild desire; A high emprize! what high emprize but suits A true Caraccioli! We meet again . . I have some warnings, some reproofs, for him. [Caraccioli goes. SCENE VI. Fra Rupert, Caraffa. Fra Rupert. Where walls are living things, have ears, eyes, mouths, Deemest thou, son Francesco! I alone Heard those most violent words about Andrea? Caraffa. What words? I never thought about the man; About his wife some little; true enough. Some little? criminal it were to say it: He who thinks little of such . . such perfection, Has left his thoughts among the worms that creep In charnel-houses, among brainless skulls, Dry bones, without a speck of blood, a thread Of fibre, ribs that never cased a heart. The volumes of the doctors of the church Could not contain a tithe of it: their clasps, Strong enough to make chains for Saracens, Their timbers to build argosies, would warp And split, if my soul's fire were pent within. Fra Rupert. Remember, son Francesco! prince Andrea, King rather (such the husband of a queen Is virtually, and should be) king Andrea Lives under my protection. Caraffa. Well, what then? Fra Rupert. What? Into mine own ear didst thou not breathe Traitorous threats? Caraffa. I? Threats? About his queen? Fra Rupert. Filthy! most filthy! Caraffa. No, no: wandering thoughts Fluttered in that direction; one thought, rather. Doves have hot livers. Fra Rupert. Be adultery Bad as it will, yet treason, son Francesco! Treason is far more difficult to deal with. Caraffa. I do suspect it may be. Fra Rupert. Saidst thou not Thou couldst half-strangle that Hungarian? Caraffa. Spake I so rashly? Fra Rupert. I am a Hungarian. Caraffa. Evident: but that noble mien would daunt Moor, Usbeck, Abyssinian: and that strength! A Switzer bear could not half-strangle it. Fra Rupert. 'Twere martyrdom, 'twere martyrdom. The life Of kings hath swords and scaffolds round about it; A word might fling thee on them. Caraffa. Such a word Must fall from holy lips, thenceforth unholy. Fra Rupert. Guided by me and courage, thou art safe. ACT III. SCENE I. IN THE PALACE. Andrea and Filippa. Andrea. Many the stories you've repeated to me, Lady Filippa! I have clean forgotten 'em; But all the bloody giants every girl Before our bed-time threw into my night-cap, Lie safe and sound there still. Filippa. I quite believe You've not the heart to drive them out, my prince. Andrea. Not I indeed. And then your sage advice! Filippa. Is all that too forgotten? Andrea. No, not all; But, dear Filippa, now that I am married, And sovran (one may say) or next door to it, You must not give me any more advice . . Not that I mind it; but to save appearances. [She bends: he goes, but returns suddenly. Lady Filippa! lady seneschal! Filippa. My prince! command me. Andrea. Solve me one more question. How happens it (while old men are so wise) That any foolish thing, advice or story, We call it an old woman's? Filippa. Prince Andrea! I know not as for stories and advice; I only know, when we are disappointed In any thing, or teazed with it, we scoff And call it an old man's. Andrea. Ah spiteful sex! Filippa. Here comes Maria: ask her no such questions. Andrea. I wish Fra Rupert heard your words. Filippa. To prove them? Maria. Give him a nosegay at the door. Andrea. He spurns Such luxury. Maria. Since his arrival here, Perfumes, they tell me, are more general And tenfold dearer: everybody wears them In self-defence: men take them with their daggers; Laundresses sprinkle them on vilest linen, Lest they be called uncleanly; round the churches What once were clouds of incense, now are canopies Of the same benzoin; kites could not fly thro'; The fainting penitents are prone to catch At the priest's surplice as he passes by, And cry, above their prayers to heaven for mercy, Stop! stop! turn back! waft me a little yet. Andrea. The father is indeed more fox than civet, And stinks out sins like sulphur and stale eggs. (To Maria.) You will not run away with him? Maria. Tarantola! Worse than most venomous tarantola, He bites, and will not let us dance for it. SCENE II. IN THE GARDENS OF CAPO DI MONTE. Boccaccio and Fiammetta. Fiammetta. I do not know whether it be quite right To listen, as I have, morn after morn And evening after evening. Boccaccio. Are my sighs Less welcome in the garden and the bower, Than where loud organ bellow'd them away, And chorister and waxlight ran between? Fiammetta. You sadly interrupted me at vespers: Never do that again, sir! When I pray, I like to pray with all my heart. Bold man! Do you dare smile at me? Boccaccio. The bold man first Was smiled at; was he not? Fiammetta. No, no such thing: But if he was, it was because he sigh'd At the hot weather he had brought with him. Boccaccio. At the cold weather he fear'd coming on He sighed. Fiammetta. And did it come? Boccaccio. Too gracious lady! Fiammetta. Keep gracious lady for dull drawing-rooms; Fiammetta is my name; I would know yours. Boccaccio. Giovanna. Fiammetta. That I know (aside). I ought, alas! Often with Acciaioli and Petrarca I've seen you walking, but have never dared To ask your name from them; your house's name I mean of course; our own names stand for nothing. You must be somebody of high estate. Boccaccio. I am not noble. Fiammetta. (shrinking back). Oh! . . then! . . Boccaccio. I must go! That is the sentence, is it not? Fiammetta. (runs and takes his hand). Don't tell me Thou art not noble: say thou art most noble: Norman . . half-Norman . . quarter-Norman . . say it. Boccaccio. Say an untruth? Fiammetta. Only this one; my heart Will faint without it. I will swear to think it A truth, wilt thou but say it. 'Tis a truth: Thy only falsehood thou hast told already, Merely to try me. If thou art not noble . . Noble thou art, and shalt be! [She sobs and pauses: he presses her hand to his bosom. Who gainsays it? Boccaccio. A merchant's son, no better, is thy slave, Fiammetta! Fiammetta. (smiling). Now art thou disguised indeed. Come, show me specimens of turquises, Amethysts, emeralds, diamonds . . out with them. Boccaccio. A merchant's, and poor merchant's son am I; Gems I have none to offer, but pure love Proof to the touchstone, to the crucible. Fiammetta. What then or who is noble, and thou not? I have heard whispers that myself am not so Who am king Robert's daughter. We may laugh At those who are, if thou and I are none. Thou art my knight, Giovanni! There now; take [Giving him her scarf. Thy patent of nobility, and wear it. Boccaccio. (kisses it). What other but were cobweb after this? Fiammetta. Ha! kiss it! but take care you don't kiss me. [Runs away. SCENE III. IN THE PALACE. Sancia and Filippa. Sancia. Even you, my dear Filippa, are alert As any of the girls, and giddy too: You have dropt something now you can not find. Filippa. I have been busy, looking here and there To find Andrea. Sancia. Leave him with his bride, Until they tire of saying tender things. Filippa. Untender things, I fear, are going on. He has been truant to the friar Rupert Of late, who threatens him with penances For leaving some injunction unperform'd. And more perhaps than penances are near: For sundry captains, sundry nobles, meet At friar Anselm's cell; thither had sped Fra Rupert. In the garden of Saint Clara Voices were heard, and threats; then whispers ran Along the walls. They walkt out, one by one, Soldiers with shuffling pace unsoldierly, Friars with folded hands, invoking heaven, And hotly calm as night ere burst Vesuvius. Sancia. Beyond the slight affronts all princes bear From those who miss what others have obtain'd, Andrea shall fear nothing: Heaven protects him. Filippa. Heaven, in its equal dispensation, gives The pious palms, the prudent length of days. We seek him not then with the same intent Of warning? Sancia. With the same of warning; you, Where the good angels guard; I, where the bad Seduce him. Having reign'd, and having heard That thither tend his wishes . . Filippa. Momentary. Sancia. But lawless wishes have returning wings Of speed more than angelic. I would win His private ear, lest courtiers take possession; I would persuade him, with his lovely bride To share all other troubles than the crown's. SCENE IV. IN THE PALACE. Andrea and Maria. Andrea. Are we then going up to Capo-Monte? How long shall we remain there? all the night? Maria. Until the evening. Andrea. And where then? Maria. Aversa. Andrea. Ay, because there I askt her if she loved me: Beside . . the strangest thing on earth . . young brides Fly from the altar and roost anywhere Rather than near it. What should frighten them? But, if we go, why not set off directly? Maria. We stay because the people round the gates, Who left too late their farms and villages To see our queen and you, expect at noon To follow the procession. Andrea. What procession? Is there another marriage? O rare sport! Maria. (continuing). From Castel-Nuovo far as Capo-Monte. Andrea. O glorious! But we really shall be let Into the gardens and the groves? Maria. Why not? Who should prevent us? Andrea. Into all? Among The marble men and women who stand there, And only stir by moonlight? I don't think They stir at all: I am half-sure they don't. Maria. I have been always of the same opinion. Andrea (shakes his head). Although he said it who says mass, I doubt it. Maria. Ah! but to doubt is not to be half-sure: The worse end may stick fast, like broken tooth. Andrea. Now if you laugh, you make an unbeliever. You girls are . . Maria. Pray what are we? Andrea. Cunninger. Fra Rupert told me he would break their bones. Maria. Did he? Andrea. As bad. He'd tumble them down headlong, If ever he once caught me looking up Again at those who stood alert for swimming. Maria. When? Andrea. Four years back. To me they seem'd pure marble, But Frate Rupert never could have spited Mere marble so, although they lookt like women. I scarcely would believe him when he said They once were devils, but could do no harm Now the salt water had been sprinkled on 'em, Unless we look at them as worshippers. Maria. I am sure you did not. Andrea. No; upon my faith! Maria. We never stand about them; we walk on. Andrea (in a low voice). What! when you are but one or two together? I like their looks: the women are quite lovely, And the men too (for devils) not amiss. I wonder where they laid their plaguy scourges; They must have had them, or were never worshipt. Maria. Did not the Frate tell you? Andrea. Ask the Frate! He would have found them in a trice, and held The scourges good enough, though not the devils. Maria. I think you mind him less than formerly. Andrea. I am a married man. Maria. But married men Fear priests and friars more than single ones. Andrea. He is the holiest monk upon God's earth, And hates you women most. Maria. Then the least holy. Andrea. Dost think it? If I thought him so, I'd fear The beast no longer, broad as are his shoulders, His breath . . pho! . . like a water-snake's, his fist Heavy as those big books in chapter-houses, And hairy as the comet; for they say 'Twas hairy; though I saw no hairs upon it. Maria. Whenever love comes upon thee, Andrea, Art thou not kinder? Andrea. Kinder, but not holier. Maria. Is not thy heart more grateful? Andrea. As may happen; A little thing would make it so. Maria. And, tell me, Art thou not readier to give alms? Andrea. Tell me How long, Maria, those bright eyes have seen Into my thoughts? Fra Rupert knows not half one Unless he question for an hour or better And stamp and threaten, nor then more than half one. I'll never fear him now: I'll tell him so. Maria. Be not too hasty: tell him no such thing. But fear him not: fear rather those about him. [Fra Rupert is prying. Andrea. Whom? Maria. His Hungarians. Andrea. They're my countrymen. Maria. Should they make all us dread them? Andrea. Me? Maria. Even you, Under Fra Rupert, like the best, or worst. Should they possess our kingdom? Andrea. My wife's kingdom? No, by the Saints! they shall not touch her kingdom. Fra Rupert (crossing the farther part of the stage). They shall not touch her kingdom . . and shalt thou? Andrea. I heard a voice. Maria. (laughing). No doubt, no doubt, the Frate's. Andrea. I hear and feel him farther off than thou dost. Maria. Andrea! were thy ears as quick to hear Thy friends as enemies. Andrea. Still would that eye Glare over me, like the great open one Above the throne at church, of gold and azure, With neither brows nor lashes, but black clouds Round it, and nought beside. Maria. The three eyes match, May-be; but is there anything in church So like his voice? Andrea. The organ bellows are, Without the keys. That was not much unlike it . . A little softer . . and not too soft, neither. Maria. I heard no voice whatever, not a sound. Are you still half afraid? Andrea. No, if thou are not. Maria. Are you convinced? Andrea. I was not very soon. Men weigh things longer than you women do. Maria! take my word, I am quite sated Of fearing, tho' (thank God!) the worst is past. Maria. I praise this manliness, this resolution. Andrea. Dost thou? Already am I grown more manly, More resolute. O! had your praise come earlier, And heartily as now, another man In thought and action might have been Andrea! But will you tell Giovanna what you think? Maria. I will indeed, and joyfully. Andrea. Her praise Is better still: yours screws the spur on heel, Hers scarfs the neck and lifts the lance to hand. What's all this tinkling? [Guitars in the next chamber; the door opens. Maria (smiling). O! again Fra Rupert! One of these voices surely must be his! Which of them? can not you distinguish it? Andrea (calls out). Who sings there? Maria. Do not stop them: let us hear. Petronilla. Ah! do not go! ah do not go Among the silly and the idle! A lover surely should not so From her who loves him slip and sidle. Garisendo. The saltarella waits for me, And I must go and I must play . . Come! do not dance, but hear and see, To-morrow we will love all day. Andrea. Now she is reasonable, he might spare her A handful of his ribbons, or that net Silver and blue there dangling down his nape. Who is he? I don't know him. Maria. Garisendo. Andrea. And t'other? Maria. Petronilla. Andrea. Nor her neither. Maria. I and Giovanna know here every face. Andrea. And every name? Maria. Every one. Andrea. Clever creatures! Maria. By all those twitchings at the two guitars, And tappings of fore-finger on the wrist, They seem to be at fault. Andrea. No harm, no matter, Zooks! they are up again; he first . . that's odd. Maria. Nay, but he only tells her what to sing. Petronilla. There is a lad upon the sea, There is, O Mary! such a lad! And all he thinks of, it is me. Garisendo. Why then, my jewel! he is mad. Petronilla. Mad! he is no more mad than you. Garisendo. Unless he stamps, and stares, and cries, As certain pretty creatures do, And stain their cheeks and spoil their eyes. Petronilla. I love, I love him with my whole . . [Sobbing. Garisendo. Go on, go on: you mean to say (I'd lay a wager) heart and soul, And very well, no doubt, you may. Petronilla. No, I may not, you cruel man! He never did what you have done, Yet, say and do the worst you can, I love, I love, but you alone. Maria. He has not much offended. Andrea. Who can tell? I am quite sorry they have fallen out. What almanack can calculate fine weather In those strange fickle regions where God plants A man and woman, and sticks love between! Maria. All the man's fault. Andrea. All hers: she went and teased him: With my own eyes I saw it; so might you. Maria. You do not always look so melancholy At music; yet what music can be gayer Than this is? Andrea. Gayer, say you? Ay, the music. But if folks quarrel so in joke, what will they In earnest? If, before they're man and wife . . Ah! Heaven be praised! there's time to break it off. Look, look at them! Maria. She seems more reconciled. Andrea. Reconciled! I should say . . Maria. Pray, don't say anything. Andrea. Ready for . . By my troth! 'twas a salute. Maria. Now what things run into your head, Andrea! Andrea. It was as like as pea to pea, if not . . However, let them know, another time They must not sing about the house in that way. Maria. Why not? Andrea. Giovanna might not like it now. Maria. So! you would do then all she likes? Andrea. I would: But if she ever hears that wicked song, She might not do all I like. Sweet Maria! Persuade them, when you see them, to forget it; And, when you go to bed, turn on your pillow, First drop it from one ear, then from the other, And never pick it up again, God love you! Maria. I'll run to them directly with your wishes. Andrea. Stay: the last verse is clever: pick out that. Maria. And nothing more? Andrea (anxiously). Don't overload your memory. SCENE V. FRA RUPERT'S CELL. Andrea and Fra Rupert. Fra Rupert. What! am I never to be left alone, Andrea? Let me have my pleasures too, Such as they are. Andrea. They're very much like mine. Have we not prayed and scourged and wept together? Fra Rupert. Ah! were that now the case! Andrea. Well, father, well! I would not stand between you and your duty: But I thought, being prince . . Fra Rupert (sneering). Thou, being prince, Thoughtest! Thou verily not only toppest Thyself, but most among thy fellows, lad! And so, Andrea! being prince, thou thoughtest? Andrea. Good-bye, thou art as brave and blithe as ever. [Goes, but turns back. I had one little thing upon my conscience. Fra Rupert. I am quite ready: let me know the whole: Since yesterday? Nod? wink? to me? Andrea (to himself). He chafes me. Fra Rupert. And throw thy head back thus? Andrea. My head's my own. Fra Rupert. Wonderful! be not over-sure of that. [Aside. If thou art contrite, go! Andrea. I will not go; I am not contrite. Fra Rupert. I am in a maze! Andrea. A scrape thou'rt in. Fra Rupert. A scrape! Who could betray me? [To himself. Andrea. Thou'st lost thy lamb, old shepherd! no great pet. Fra Rupert. No, nor great loss: when lambs, tho', lose their shepherd They find the shambles nearer than the fold. Andrea. Father! you said you must confer with me Another time? Fra Rupert. I did so. Andrea. Why not now? Fra Rupert. I see not why: but soon Caraccioli, And first Caraffa, must unbosom here. Thou hast much power, Andrea! thou canst do Anything now to glorify thy country. Andrea. Suppose I wish to swim to Ischia; could I? Fra Rupert. My boy! thou hast not wind enough for that. Am I to be evaded, taunted, posed? Or thinkest thou, Andrea, that because A silly girl espouses thee . . Andrea. By Peter! She who espouses me shall ne'er be call'd A silly girl. I am a husband, Frate! I am a boy no longer: I can cope With women: and shall men then, even tho' friars, Pretend to more? I will go back and call The maidens: they shall pelt you from the palace If ever you set foot within its walls. Fra Rupert. Should every stone from maiden hit my nose, A grain of dust would hurt it tenfold more. Andrea. Know, they have tongues that yours could never meet. Fra Rupert. Andrea! wouldst thou kill me with unkindness? Andrea. Gad! he sheds tears! . . Now at him! . . Yes, I would. Fra Rupert. And bring down these grey hairs . . Andrea. Which hairs are they? The skull's are shaven, and the beard's are dirty; They may be grey though. Fra Rupert. Shame upon thy mirth! I am a poor old man. Andrea. 'Tis your vocation. Beside, I have heard say that poverty Is the best bargain for the best place yonder In Paradise. All prick their feet before They clamber upward into that inclosure: 'Tis well worth while. Fra Rupert. Age too (alas how heavy!) To serve my loving ward, my prince's son, I would support still longer, willingly. Andrea. Frate! 'tis more than I can say for it. [Rupert creeps supplicatingly toward him. Out of my sight! crawl back again . . I loathe thee. SCENE VI. Fra Rupert (alone). I have no malice in me: if I know My secret heart, no heart so pure of malice: But all my cares and vigils, hopes and dreams, Blown by a boy, spurn'd by a brute, away! So ends it? Blessed Stephen! not so ends it. It ends with him, and with him only: me No sword can touch. Why are not come those fools? I thought the other would have kept them off. I will have power without him, and not thro' him. They must have clean forgotten. 'Tis the hour . . 'Tis past it . . no, not past it . . just the hour; The bell now strikes for noon. [A knocking. One comes at last. [Opens the door: Caraffa enters. Fra Rupert. Exactly to the moment. Caraffa. I was walking About the cloister till I heard the bell, For Father Rupert's hours are golden ones. Fra Rupert. May my friends spend them profitably for me! Caraffa! thine are number'd. Caraffa. All men's are. Fra Rupert. But some are not notcht off like schoolboy's days Anxious to see his parent. Thou may'st see Thy parent too. Caraffa. I left him but just now. Fra Rupert. We all have one, one whom we all have left Too often. Hast thou not some sins for me? Caraffa. As many as a man could wish to have. Fra Rupert. Are there none dangerous? none involving life? Hast thou forgotten our last conference? Caraffa. No, nor shall ever. But what danger there? Fra Rupert. Need I to say, Francesco, that no breath Transpired from me? We both were overheard. Caraffa. I think you hinted it. Fra Rupert. I fear'd it only. Thou knowest my fond love . . I will not say For thee . . thou art but second in my breast . . Poor, poor Andrea! Caraffa. Never fear about him. Giovanna, even tho' she did not love, (O that she did not!) yet would never wrong him. Fra Rupert. Nay, God forbid she should! 'Twas not for me To mark her looks, her blushes, gestures . . how Faltered the word “Caraffa” as she spoke it. Thy father then said nothing? Caraffa. Not a word; What should he? Fra Rupert. Not a word. Old men are close: And yet I doubted . . I am apt to doubt . . Whether he might not . . for ambition stirs Most fathers . . just let slip . . Why didst thou falter? For never faltered child as thou didst falter. Thou knowest then her mind better than we? Caraffa. I know it? I divine it? Would I did! Fra Rupert. Nay, rather let the bubble float along Than break it: the rich colours are outside. Everything in this world is but a bubble, The world itself one mighty bubble, we Mortals, small bubbles round it! Caraffa. Frate! Frate! Thou art a soapy one! No catching thee! [Aside. [Aloud.] What hopes thou showest me! If these were solid As thou, most glorious bubble who reflect'st them, Then, then indeed, to me from this time forth The world, and all within the world, were bubbles. Fra Rupert. A knight art thou, Caraffa! and no title (Secular title, mind! secular title) Save only royalty, surpasses knighthood. There is no condescension in a queen Placing her foot within the palm of knight, And springing from it on her jewel'd saddle: No condescension is there if she lend To theirs the sceptre who lent hers the sword. Knights there have been, and are, where kings are not, Kings without knights what are they? Caraffa. Norman blood Runs in my veins as in her own: no king (Savage or tame) shall stand above those knights Who raised his better to the throne he won: Of such am I. But what am I before Giovanna! to adore, to worship her, Is glory far above the chiselling Of uncouth kings, or dashing them to earth: O be it mine! Fra Rupert. Perhaps some other Norman May bear less tamely the new yoke; perhaps A Filangieri may, this very night . . Caraffa. No Filangieri ever stoopt to treachery. No sword of Norman ever struck by night. Credulous monk! to me name Filangieri! Quellers of France and England as we are, And jealous of precedency, no name (Offence to none) is higher than Filangieri. Fra Rupert. Boaster! Caraffa. I boast of others; few do that Who merit such a title. Fra Rupert. Lower thy crest; Pause! thou art in my hands. Caraffa. I am in God's. Fra Rupert (mildly, after hesitation). Who knows but God hath chosen thee, amid His ministers of wrath, to save thy country And push oppression from her! Dreams and signs Miraculous have haunted me. Caraffa. Thee, Frate! Fra Rupert. Me, even me. My ministry is over: Marriage ends pupilage, and royalty Ends friendship. Little is it short of treason To say that kings have friends. Caraffa. How short of treason I know not, but I know how wide of truth. Fra Rupert. Listen! There are designs against the life Of young Andrea. Caraffa. By the saints above! I hope there are not. Fra Rupert. If thy name be found Among conspirators (and those are call'd Conspirators who vindicate their country) Where thy sword is, there must thy safety be. The night for vengeance is the marriage-night. Caraffa. I draw the sword without defiance first? I draw the sword uninjured? Whom against? Against a life so young! so innocent Of any guile! a bridegroom! in his bed! O! is this horror only at the crime? Or is it . . No, by heaven! 'tis heaven's own horror At such unmanly deed. I, Frate! I, Caraffa, stain with tears Giovanna's cheek! I sprinkle poison on the flowers she smells! Fra Rupert (resolutely). Hark ye, Caraffa! If the public good . . Caraffa. Away with public good! Was never book Put in my hand? was never story told me? Show me one villain vile beyond the rest, Did not that villain talk of public good? Fra Rupert. Only at friars are Caraffa's stabs. Valiant and proud and wealthy as thou art, Thou may'st have nothing left on earth to-morrow. Caraffa. I shall have more to-morrow than to-day. My honour may shoot up all in one night, As did some tree we read of. Fra Rupert. Thou art rash. Caraffa. Rashness may mellow into courage; time Is left me. Fra Rupert. For thy prayers. Caraffa. My prayer then is, Peace, safety, glory, joy, to our Giovanna! Fra Rupert. Thou may'st depart. Caraffa (indignantly). For ever. [Goes. Fra Rupert. He says well. Caraccioli enters. Fra Rupert (smiling and embracing him). Caraccioli! without our friend Caraffa! Caraccioli. He should have been here first. Fra Rupert (aside). Perfectly safe! I did not follow him into the cloister. Caraccioli. Father! you seem as pondering to yourself How that wild fellow kept his word so ill; Caraffa-like! Fra Rupert. I keep mine well with him. Caraccioli. He should have thought of that. Fra Rupert. He had no time. Caraccioli. Always so kind! so ready with your plea For little imperfections! Our Francesco, Somewhat hot-headed, is warm-hearted too. Fra Rupert. His petty jealousy about the queen (Were there no sin behind it) we might smile at. Caraffa stands not with Caraccioli. Caraccioli. On the same level . . there particularly. Fra Rupert. Ho! ho! you laugh and jeer about each other? Caraccioli. We might. How she would laugh at two such ninnies! Fra Rupert. At one, most certainly. But laughing girls Often like grave men best. There's something grand As well as grave even in the sound “Caraccioli.” Caraccioli. I have no hopes. Fra Rupert. How I rejoice to hear it! Hopes are but wishes, wishes are but sin, And, fed with ranker exhalations, poison. Caraccioli. The subtilest consumes me. Fra Rupert. What? Caraccioli. Despair. Fra Rupert. Violets and primroses lie under thorns Often as asps and adders; and we find The unexpected often as the expected, The pleasant as the hideous. Caraccioli. That may be, But what avails your lesson? whither tends it? Fra Rupert. My son! I hear from those who know the world And sweep its noisome litter to my cell, There are mild days when love calls love abroad As birds call birds, and even leaves call leaves: Moments there are, my poor Caraccioli! Moments in which the labyrinth of the ear At every turn of its proclivity Grows warmer, and holds out the clue, itself: Severity should not beget despair. I would not much encourage thee, nor yet Dash all thy hopes, however inconsiderate, For hopes there may be, though there should not be, Flickering even upon despondency. There may be sounds in certain names to smite The stagnant heart, and swell its billows high Over wide spaces, over distant years . . There may; but who would utter them and know it? Delicate is the female sense, yet strong In cherishing and resenting; very prompt At hiding both, and hating the discoverer. Never, my Paolo! look too deeply in, Or thou may'st find what thou art looking for. Not that she ever said one word against thee; She even lower'd her voice in naming thee, Seeing her sister and the rest sit giggling, “Anything else! anything else!” said she, And snapt the thread she workt with, out of spite. A friend, who hopes the best, may tell the worst. Patience will weary; even Giovanna's patience. I could go farther, and relate . . but why Why ('tis too light to touch upon) relate The little hurt she gave Filippa's ancle With that lark heel of hers, by twitching it Uneasily? O the impatient sex! She did shed . . tears I will not say . . a tear . . Shed it! no, I am wrong: it came, it stayed, As hangs one star, the first and only one, Twinkling, upon some vernal evening. Caraccioli. I am but clay beneath her feet. Alas! Clay there would quicken into primal man, Glorified and immortal once again. Fra Rupert. Thou art too hot, my Paolo! One pulse less In the half-hour might have been rather better. Lovest thou our Francesco? Caraccioli. Like a brother. Fra Rupert. He should not then have brought thy life in peril. Andrea is quite furious: all at court Are sworn upon thy ruin. Caraccioli. Upon mine? I will then calmly tell them they are wrong. Fra Rupert. Will they as calmly hear? Francesco said, Imprudent youth! you boasted of remembering Every the lightest mole about Giovanna. Caraccioli. I say it? Fra Rupert. Those were not your words? Caraccioli. My words! Fra Rupert. Certainly not . . precisely. Caraccioli. Holy Mary! Is there in Naples, Hungary, or Hell, The monster who dares utter them? Fra Rupert. 'Tis hard Our friend should be the very man. Caraccioli. 'Tis false, Frate! 'tis false: my friend is not the man. [Bursts away. Fra Rupert (sneering). I will not follow him into the cloister. ACT IV. SCENE I. IN THE GARDEN OF CAPO DI MONTE. Boccaccio and Fiammetta. Boccaccio. (sings). If there be love on earth, 'tis here, O maid of royal line! Should they who spring from heroes, fear? Be scornful the divine? Shine not the stars upon the sea, Upon the fountain too? O! let your eyes then light on me, And O! let mine see you. [Fiammetta comes forward. How kind to come! Fiammetta. To come into the air? I like it. They are all at their merenda. The smell of melon overpowers me quite; I could not bear it; therefore I just come Into the air to be revived a little. And you too here? Sly as the satyr-head [Affecting surprise. Under yon seat! Boccaccio. Did you not tell me? Fiammetta. I? You dreamt it. Boccaccio. Let me dream then on? Without Such dreams, Fiammetta, dull would be the sleep Call'd life. Fiammetta (looking round timidly). I must be broad awake. Boccaccio. You must. Fiammetta (nodding). And you. All are indulgent to me; most Of all queen Sancia and Giovanna. Boccacio. One A saint, the other better. Fiammetta. Then the grave. Filippa . . Boccaccio. Grave and watchful. Fiammetta. Not a word Against her! I do hold her in my heart, Although she gives me good advice sometimes. Boccaccio. I'm glad to hear it; for the very worthy Are very rarely general favourites. Fiammetta. Some love our friend most cordially; those know her: Others there are who hate her; those would know her And can not: for she stands aloof and thanks them: Remoter, idler, neither love nor hate, Nor care about her; and the worst and truest They say of her, is, that her speech is dark. Boccaccio. Doubtless, the vulgar eye will take offence If cedar chambers are unwasht with lime. Fiammetta. But why are you come here? Boccaccio. To gaze, to sigh, And, O Fiammetta! tell me if . . to live. Fiammetta (laughing). I never saw more signs of life in any. Boccaccio. Cruel! Fiammetta. To find the signs of life in you? Boccaccio. To scoff them out. Fiammetta. I am incapable. [Boccaccio rises, and steps back, gazing fondly. O now, Giovanni! I am terrified! Why! you sprang up . . as if you sprang to kiss me! Did ever creature think of such a thing? Boccaccio. The drooping blades of grass beneath your feet Think of it; the cold runlet thinks of it; The pure sky (how it smiles upon us!) thinks of it . . I will no more then think of it. [Kisses her. Fiammetta. Giovanni! Ah! I shall call you (wretch!) to task for this. Boccaccio. Call; and, by heaven! I'll come, tho' from the grave. Fiammetta. Any one now would say you thought me handsome. Boccaccio. Earth has two beauties; her Bellagio And Anacapri; earth's inhabitants Have only one among them. Fiammetta. Whom? Boccaccio. Fiammetta. [Going. Fiammetta. Where are you running now? Stay! tho' quite angry, I am not yet so angry as I should be: But, if you ever take such liberties Again! Boccaccio. O never! . . till we reach Aversa. Fiammetta. And will you there? and tell me to my face? [Is departing. Wait, wait for pardon. Must we part? so soon? So long a time? Boccaccio. Till star-light. Fiammetta. Stay a moment. Boccaccio. Gladly a life: but my old mule loves walking And meditation. Now the mask and dress, And boy to carry them, must all be found. Fiammetta. Boy, mask, dress, mule! speed, gallop, to Aversa! Boccaccio. So many kisses lie upon this hand, Mine hardly reach it. Fiammetta. Lips there may have been; Had there been kisses, I must sure have felt them, As I did yours . . at least I thought I did . . But go, for I am half afraid of you . . That is, of your arriving yonder late. Go, else the crowd may stop you; and perhaps I might delay you for some sudden fancy, Or . . go your ways . . not let you go at all. SCENE II. FRA RUPERT'S CELL. Fra Rupert, alone. [Fra. Rupert] I wisht him power; for what was his was mine; I wisht him jealousy, distrust, aversion For his pert bride, that she might have no share. I never fail'd before this wretched day. Fail'd! I have not: I will possess my rights, Spring over him, and never more be spurn'd. They who had rais'd his seat shall stablish mine, Without those two vain boys: O! had they done it! And not been where they are! The fault was theirs. Maximin enters. Fra Rupert. Maximin! since thy services may soon Be call'd for, satchel on thee my experience, Then set about thy work. My Maximin! Mind how thou liest! Know, if lie thou must, Lies, while they sap their way and hold their tongues, Are safe enough: when breath gets into them, They, and the work about them, may explode. Maximin! there are more lies done than said. Son! when we hesitate about the right, We're sure to do the wrong. Maximin. I don't much hesitate. Fra Rupert. To chain a dog and to unchain a dog Is hazardous alike, while the deaf beast Stands barking: he must sleep; then for the cord. Maximin. What! are my services in some farm-yard? I am a soldier. Fra Rupert. All great statesmen have been. How large a portion of the world is each In his own eyes. Maximin. Am I so proud in saying I am a soldier? Fra Rupert. I am proud of thee: Be that sufficient. Give thou every man What he requires of thee. Maximin. A world to each? Fra Rupert. Not so: yet hold not up to him a glass That shows him less, or but some digits greater. Maximin. Honestly now, Fra Rupert, by my cross! No gull art thou. I knew that trick myself, And (short the digits) told it word for word. Fra Rupert. I will be sworn for thee. Being minister. (Not that I think it certain just at present, For when the sage and honest are most wanted, That is the chink of time they all drop through) But when thou art so, mind this precept. One Not wise enough to keep the wiser off Should never be a minister of state. Maximin. Fra Rupert! presto! make me one to-day. Give fifty precepts, there they go [Blowing] but this, I'll kiss the cross and the queen's hand, and keep. Fra Rupert. I make thee minister! Maximin. You can make kings. Fra Rupert. Not even those! I might have made Andrea What thou and every true Hungarian Wisht him to be, ere he show'd hoof for claw, And thought to trample down his countrymen. Maximin. Andrea bloody-minded! turtle-doves Are bloody-minded then, and leave their elm, The first day's mating, for the scent of gore. Fra Rupert. Maximin! here is no guitar for thee, Else mightest thou sip that pure poetry Preciously warm and frothy from the udder. Maximin. Father! if any in our troop call'd me A poet, he should sing for it. Fra Rupert. Thou'rt brave, Maximin! and Andrea is not bloody. But there are princes, or have been within Our memory, who, when blood gusht forth like water From their own people, stood upon some bridge Or island, waving their plumed caps, and drank The cries of dying men with drunken ears. Maximin. Curses, eternal curses, man's and God's, Upon such heathens! Fra Rupert. Nay, they were not heathens; Happily they were christians, Maximin! Andrea, though myself instructed him, Is treacherous. Better were this pasty people Dissolved, washt down, than brave Hungarians perish. Maximin. No truer word prophet or saint e'er spoke. Fra Rupert (sighing). Saint hath not spoken it: O may not prophet! Maximin. I, being neither, can not understand you. Fra Rupert. The innocent, the helpless, are surrounded. Maximin. Andrea? Fra Rupert. My Andrea would betray us. Maximin. To whom? Are we the helpless? we the innocent? Fra Rupert. While he is yonder at Aversa, we Are yelling thro' these very streets for mercy. Maximin. I cry you mercy, father! When I yell, I'll borrow whistles from some thirty good Neapolitans, who 'll never want them more. Fra Rupert. Be ready then! be ready for Aversa! Glory stands there before thee; seize the traitor, Win wealth, win jewels, win . . What have not palaces For brave young men upon such nights as these? Maximin. Would'st bid me stick Andrea? Fra Rupert. Hungary, Not I; our country, not revenge. Maximin. Bids murder? I will proclaim thy treason thro' the camp. Fra Rupert. Unhappy son, forbear! By thy sweet mother! Upon my knees! Upon my knees before A mortal man! Yea, Rupert! bend thy head; Thy own son's hand should, and shall, spill thy blood. [Maximin starts, then hesitates, then rushes at him. Maximin. Impudent hound! I'll have thy throat for that. Fra Rupert (guards his throat). Parricide! make me not cry murder . . love Forbids it . . rather die! My son! my son! Hide but thy mother's shame; my shame, not hers. [Maximin relaxes his grasp. Maximin! stand between the world and it? Oh! what avails it! sinner as I am! Other worlds witness it. [Maximin looses hold. My Maximin? [Rupert embraces him. Maximin. Why, how now, Frate! hath some wine-vault burst And fuddled thee? we know thou never drinkest. Fra Rupert. That lighter sin won't save me. Maximin. If light sins Could save us, I have many a bushelful, And little need your sentry-boxes yonder. Fra Rupert (very mildly). I must reprove (my own dear child!) (Passionately) . . I must Reprove, however gently, such irreverence. Confessionals are sentry-boxes! true! And woe betide the sentry that naps there! Woe, if he spare his voice, his prayer, his curse! Maximin. Curses we get dog-cheap; the others, reasonable. Fra Rupert. Sweet Maximin! whatever my delight In gazing on those features (for sharp shame, When love blows over it from lands afar, Tingles with somewhat too, too like delight!) We must now part. Thy fortune lies within My hands. To-night, if thy own officers Command thee to perform a painful office . . Maximin. Good father! what know we of offices? Let them command a duty, and 'tis done. Fra Rupert. Discreet tho'! Maximin! discreet! my marrow! Let not a word escape thee, not a breath. Blessings, my tender kid! We must walk on (I love thee so!) together thro' the cloister. Maximin. No, father! no; too much! Fra Rupert. Too much for thee! [Rupert precedes, speaks to three men, who bow and retire; he disappears. Maximin (loitering in the cloister). Incredible! yet friars and cockroaches Creep thro' all rooms, and like the closet best. Let me consider! can it be? how can it? He is bare fifty; I am forty-one. SCENE III. THE GARDEN OF FRIAR ANSELM'S CONVENT. Fra Rupert, Klapwrath, Zinga, and Psein. Fra Rupert. Ye brave supporters of Hungarian power And dignity! O Zinga! Klapwrath! Psein! Becomes it me to praise (we may admire Those whom to praise were a temerity) Such men as you. Psein. Us? we are only captains. Zinga. After hard service we are nothing more. Klapwrath. Twenty-three years hath Klapwrath rid and thirsted. Fra Rupert. Ingratitude! the worst of human crimes, Hardly we dare to say; so flat and stale, So heavy with sick sobs from mouth to mouth, The ejaculation. To my mind scarce witchery Comes up to it. Psein. Hold! father! For that sin Either we deal with devils or old women. Fra Rupert. Man was created of the dust; to make The fragile mass cohesive, were employed The bitter waters of ingratitude. [Affects to weep. Klapwrath. Weeping will never rinse that beaker, Frate! Fra Rupert. It is not for myself. Zinga. We see it is not. Fra Rupert. Ye can not see deep into me. Psein. Few can. Fra Rupert. Ye can not see the havoc made within By ever-dear Andrea. Zinga. Havoc? Fra Rupert. Havoc! Klapwrath. I like the word: purses and rings hang round it, Necklaces, brooches, and indented armlets. Psein. But, ere we reach 'em, ugly things enough, Beside the broken swords that lie below And brave men brandisht in the morning light. Klapwrath. Brave men then should not cross us; wise men don't. Fra Rupert. Your spirit all attest; but those the least Whose safety hangs upon your saddle-skirts. Men are not valued for their worth in Italy: Of the same price the apple and the peach, The service and the fig. Zinga. Well, there they beat us. Psein. Whatever they may be, we can not help it. Fra Rupert. Help it, I say, ye can; and ye shall help it, Altho' I perish for ye. Klapwrath. Then indeed, Frate! some good might come of it; but wilt thou? Fra Rupert. Abandon to his fate my poor Andrea! Has he not slept upon this bosom? Klapwrath. Has he? He must have had some scratches on his face. Fra Rupert. Has he not eaten from this hand? Klapwrath. Why then, He'll never die for want of appetite. Fra Rupert. Have we not drunk our water from one bowl? Klapwrath. Father! you were not very liberal; He might have drunk the whole of mine, and welcome. Fra Rupert. How light ye make of life! Zinga. Faith! not so light; I think it worth a tug, for my part of it; Nor would I leave our quarters willingly. Psein. O the delight of floating in a bath, One hand athwart an orange-bough, the other Flat on the marble pavement, and our eyes Wandering among those figures round the arch That scatter flowers, and laugh at us, and vie With one another which shall tempt us most! Nor is it undelightful, in my mind, To let the curly wave of the warm sea Climb over me, and languishingly chide My stopping it, and push me gently away. Klapwrath. Water, cold, tepid, hot, is one to me. The only enemy to honest wine Is water; plague upon it! Zinga. So say I. Fra Rupert. Three braver friends ne'er met. Hei! hei! hei! hei! The very name of friend! You can not know What love I bear Andrea! Psein. All the world Knows it. Frate. The mischief he designs, who guesses? Psein. All boys are mischievous. Fra Rupert. Alas! but mischief There might be without treachery. Psein. Poor Andrea! So little fit for it! Fra Rupert. Frank generous souls Always are first to suffer from it, last To know it when they meet it. Klapwrath. Who shall harm Our own king's colt? Who moves, speaks, looks, against him, Why! that man's shroud is woven, and spread out. Fra Rupert. Let mine then be! would it had been so ere I saw this day! Psein. What has he done? Fra Rupert. To me All kindness ever. Why such mad resolves Against the lives of his most sure defenders? Against his countrymen, his guards, his father's Most chosen friends? Zinga. Against your life? Fra Rupert. No! no! Heaven protects me; he sees it; nor indeed (To do him justice) has he such a heart. But why ask me to aid him? Why ask me Whether he was as strong at heart as Zinga, Dexterous at sword as Klapwrath, such a fool . . Pardon! your pardon, gentlemen! [Looking at Psein. Psein. As Psein. Fra Rupert. The very word! Who else dared utter it? I give him up! I almost give him up! Klapwrath. He shall not rule us. The best blood of Hungary Shall not be pour'd this night upon the wine. Fra Rupert. If you must leave the country . . and perhaps No worse may reach the greater part of you . . Psein. I have no mind to leave it. Zinga. None shall drive us. Klapwrath. The wines of Hungary strive hard with these, Yet Klapwrath is contented; he hates change. Zinga. Let us drink these out first, and then try those. Fra Rupert. Never will come the day when pine-root fire And heavy cones puff fragrance round the room, And two bluff healthy children drag along (One by the ear, the other by the scut) A bulging hare for supper; where each greyhound Knows his own master, leaps up, hangs a foot Inward, and whimpers piteously to see Flagons go round, then off for bread and lard. Those were your happy times; unless when foray Stirr'd ye to wrath, and beeves and swine and trulls (Tempting ye from propriety) heapt up A mount of sins to strive against; abduction Of linen-chests, and those who wove the linen; And shocking oaths obscene, and well-nigh acts; Fracture of cellar-doors, and spinning-wheels; And (who can answer for you) worse, worse, worse! Klapwrath. 'Sblood! Frate! runs no vine-juice in our arteries? Psein's forehead starts wry veins upon each side; His nostrils blow so hot they'll crack my boots. Zinga. Must we move hence? Fra Rupert. To die like sheep? like conies? Ye shall not die alone; I will die with you. There have been kings who sacrificed their sons. Abraham would have done it; Pagans have; But guardians such as I am! . . Klapwrath. Frate! Frate! Don't tear those tindery rags, or they will quit thee With only horse-hair under, and some stiffer. Fra Rupert. You conquer me, you conquer me, I yield. He was not bloody. Could it end with one! And we knew which . . or two, or three. Zinga. But us? Fra Rupert. “If once the captains of the companies,” Said he . . and then, I own, he said no more: He saw me shudder, and he sped away. Klapwrath. Are we to hold our throats out to the knife? Fra Rupert. Patience! dear doubtful Klapwrath! mere suspicion! He did not say the knife, or sword, or halter, He might have meant the scaffold; nothing worse; Deprive you he might not of all distinction, Nay, might spare one or other of you yet: Why then prevent what may need no prevention? Slyer are few; many more sanguinary: Must we (don't say it) give him up? I hope He's mischievous through weakness, not malignity. Zinga. What matters that? A feather-bed may stifle us (If we will let it) with a babe to press it. Is there no other prince in Hungary Fit to maintain us here? Fra Rupert. The very thought That came into my head! Psein. But when ours fall, What matters it who leaps upon his horse To overlook our maintenance? A fool I may be; can his wisdom answer that? Zinga. He doubts my courage, bringing thus his own Against it. He's a boy: were he a man, No injury, no insult, no affront . . Every man is as brave as I . . Stop there! By all my saints! (He shows several about him) by all my services! This hilt shall smash his teeth who dares say, “braver.” Klapwrath. What I am you know best, at battling it; Nothing is easier: but I've swum two nights And days together upon Baian wine, And so have ye: 'twould swamp that leaky nump-skull. Behead us; good! but underrate us; never! Fra Rupert. Having thus clear'd our consciences, and shown Our purity in face of day, we swear . . [Hesitates. Zinga. Frate, if you don't grudge an oath or two . . Fra Rupert. Death to Andrea! loyalty to Lewis! All. Hurrah! Fra Rupert. Sweet friends! profane not thus the cloister! Leave me to weep for him! the cruel boy! SCENE IV. PALACE OF AVERSA; SALOON OVERLOOKING THE GARDEN. Sancia, Filippa, Maria, Fiammetta. Maria. Ha! here they come again. See! lady Sancia Leaning upon Filippa. They are grown Wiser, and will not barter songs for griefs. Boccaccio sings. A mellow light on Latmos fell; It came not from the lowly cell, It glided from the skies; It lighted upon one who slept, Some voice then askt him why he wept, Some soft thing prest his eyes. Another might have wondered much, Or peer'd, or started at the touch, But he was far too wise; He knew the light was from above, He play'd the shifting game of love, And lost at last three sighs. Fiammetta (to Filippa). I wish he would come nearer, just to see How my hair shines, powder'd with dust of gold: I think he then would call me . . Maria. What? Fiammetta. Fiammetta. Filippa. He hardly . . poet as he seems to be . . Such as he is . . could feign a better name. He does not seem to be cut out for singing. Fiammetta. I would not have his voice one tittle altered. The poetry is pretty . . She says nothing. The poetry is charming . . Now she hears me. The most delightful poetry! . . O lady Filippa! not one praise for it! not one! I never dreamt you were yourself a poet. Filippa. These summer apples may be palatable, But will not last for winter; the austere And wrinkle-rinded have a better chance. Throw a whole honeycomb into a haystalk, It may draw flies, but never will feed horses. From these same cogs (eternally one tune) The mill has floured us with such dust all over As we must shake off, or die apoplectic. Your gentle silken-vested swains may wish All poetry one sheepfold. Maria. Sheep are well, Like men and most things, in their proper places, But when some prancing knight would entertain us, Some gallant, brightening every gem about him, I would not have upon the palace-steps A hind cry out, “Make way there for my sheep.” They say (not speaking of this woolsy race) They say that poets make us live for ever. Filippa. Sometimes the life they lend is worse than none, Shorn of its glory, shrivel'd up for want Of the fresh air of virtue. Fiammetta. Yet, to live! O! and to live by those we love so well! Filippa. If such irregularities continue After to-night, when freedoms are allowed, We must lock up the gardens, rigorously Forbidding all the inmates of the palace. To use the keys they have. Fiammetta. The good king Robert Sooner had driven out the nightingales Than the poor timid poets. Filippa. Timid poets! What breed are they of? Fiammetta. Such as sing of love. Filippa. The very worst of all; the boldest men! Maria. Nay; not the boldest; very quarrelsome, Tragic and comic, hot and cold, are so; And so are nightingales; the gardener Has told me; and the poets do no worse Than they do. Here and there they pluck a feather From one another, here and there a crumb; But, for hard fighting, fair straightforward fighting, With this one nosegay I could beat them all. In good king Robert's day were lute and lyre; Nor hardly dare we hang them on the nail, But run away and throw them down before The boisterous drum and trumpet hoarse with rage. Let poetry and music, dear Filippa, Gush forth unfrozen and uncheckt! Filippa. Ah child! Thy fancy to some poet hath inflamed: Believe me they are dangerous men. Maria. No men Are dangerous. Filippa. O my child! Maria. The very creatures Whom God has given us for our protection. Filippa. But against whom? Maria. I never thought of that. Fiammetta. Somebody told me once that good king Robert Gave keys to three or four, who neither were Nor would be constant inmates of the court. Maria. Who might and would not! This is an enigma. They must have felt then very low indeed. Among our glass-house jewels newly set, I have seen vile ones, and have laught to think How nicely would my slipper pat their faces; They never felt thus low. Sancia. We feel it for them. Prescriptively, we leave to our assayers To stamp the currency of gold and brass. Fiammetta (to Filippa). Have you not prais'd the king your very self For saying to Petrarca, as he did, “Letters are dearer to me than my crown, And, were I forced to throw up one or other, Away should go the diadem, by Jove!” Sancia. Thou art thy very father. Kiss me, child! His father said it, and thy father would. When shall such kings adorn the throne again! Fiammetta. When the same love of what Heaven made most lovely Enters their hearts; when genius shines above them, And not beneath their feet. [Goes up to Giovanni. Sancia (to Filippa). Rapturous girl! Warmth ripens years and wisdom. She discourses Idly as other girls on other things. Filippa. That ripening warmth fear I. Sancia. Portending what? Filippa. Ah, gracious lady! sweetest fruits fall soonest . . Sancia. (Who sweeter?) Filippa. And are bruised the most by falling. Maria (joining them). Sicily and myself are disagreed. Surely the man who sang must have thick fingers. He play'd so badly: but his voice is sweet, For all its trembling. Fiammetta. Now I think the trembling Makes it no worse. I wish he would go on. Maria. Evidently the song should finish there. Fiammetta. Evidently it should go on . . (aside) for ever. Maria. Ho! ho! you are not cruel to the knight? Fiammetta. It is no knight at all. Sancia. How know you that? Maria. You would be frightened . . Fiammetta. He could never frighten. Maria. If tilting. . Fiammetta. Nobody would hurt Giovanni. SCENE V. Andrea, Maria, and Fiammetta. Andrea. So! you too have been listening, every soul, I warrant ye. Maria. And have you too, Andrea? Andrea. From that snug little watch-tower: 'twas too high; I only lookt upon the tops of trees. See! him there! maskt! under the mulberry! Fiammetta. I do not see him . . Look for him elsewhere: That is a shadow. Andrea. Think you so? It may be. And the guitar? Fiammetta. What! that great yellow toad-stool? Andrea. How like is everything we see by starlight! Fiammetta (aside). If there were not a star in all the sky, Every one upon earth would know Giovanni! Andrea. I wish the mulberries were not past, that dozens Might drop upon him, and might speckle over His doublet: we should see it like a trout To-morrow, white and crimson, and discover The singer of this nonsense about light. Fiammetta. If you don't like it, pray don't listen to it. Maria (maliciously). Then let us come away. Fiammetta. Pray do. Maria (taking her arm). Come. Fiammetta (peevishly). No. Maria. Listen! another song! Fiammetta. Hush! for Heaven's sake! O! will you never listen? All this noise! Maria. Laughter might make some; smiles are much too silent. Fiammetta. Well; you have stopt him; are you now content? Maria. Quite, quite; if you are. Fiammetta. He begins again! Hush! for the hope of Paradise! O hush! Boccaccio sings. List! list ye to another tale! Fiammetta. No; he who dares tell one To other ears than one's shall fail. Boccaccio. I sing for her alone. Andrea. I have a mind to be . . Maria. What? prince! Andrea. What? angry. Maria. Not you. Andrea. Not I? Why, who should hinder me? Maria (coaxing). No, no; you won't be angry, prince! Andrea. I said Half-angry, and resolve to keep my word. Maria. Anger is better, as pomegranates are, Split into halves, and losing no small part. Andrea. I never heard such truth about pomegranates! What was the other thing we reason'd on? Ho! now I recollect, as you shall see. [Goes: all follow. SCENE VI. GARDEN. Andrea, Maria, Fiammetta, and Boccaccio. Andrea. Keep back: where thieves may be, leave men alone. Now for drawn swords! Where are they; slipt behind The mulberry: wisely schemed! 'twon't do! come forth! Yield! tremble like a poplar-leaf! Who art thou? [Seizing Boccaccio. Boccaccio. King Robert, sir, respected me. Andrea. Did he? Did he? Then far more highly should Andrea. Sicily! treat him kindly. We may all, Even you and I, commit an indiscretion. How the stars twinkle! how the light leaves titter! And there are secret quiverings in the herbs, As if they all knew something of the matter, And wisht it undisturb'd. To-night no harm Shall happen to the worst man in Aversa. ACT V. SCENE I. PALACE OF AVERSA. Andrea and Giovanna. Giovanna. How gracefully thou sattest on thy horse, Andrea! Andrea. Did I? Giovanna. He curveted so, Sidled and pranced and croucht and plunged again, I almost was afraid, but dared not say it. Andrea. Castagno is a sad curvetting rogue. Giovanna. 'Twas not Castagno; 'twas Polluce. Andrea. Was it? How canst thou tell, Giovanna? Giovanna. I can tell. Andrea. All at hap-hazard: I am very sure 'Twas not the horse you lookt at; nor did I Think about riding, or about the palfrey, Crimson and gold, half palfrey and half ostrich. But thou too ridest like a queen, my dove! Giovanna. So very like one? Would you make me proud? Andrea. God forbid that! I love thee more for beauty. Ne'er put on pride, my heart! thou dost not want it; Many there are who do; cast it to them Who can not do without it, empty souls! Ha! how you look! is it surprise or pleasure? Giovanna. Pleasure, my love! I will obey with pleasure This your first order. But indeed, my husband, You must not look so fondly when the masks come, For you and I, you know, shall not be masked. Andrea. A pretty reason for not looking fond! Must people then wear masks for that? Giovanna. Most do. I never saw such fondness as some masks Presented. Andrea. Thou hast never seen half mine; Thou shalt; and then shalt thou sit judge between us. We have not spoken more to-day, my chuck, Than many other days, yet thou appearest Wiser than ever. I have gain'd from thee More than I gave. Giovanna. And, without flattery, I am more pleas'd with your discourse than ever. Andrea (fondly). No, not than ever. In this very room Didst thou not give to me this very hand Because I talked so well? Giovanna. We foolish girls Are always caught so. Andrea. Always kept so, too? Well, we must see about it then, in earnest. Giovanna. Andrea! one thing see to: pray inquire If, in the crowd that rushed so thro' the gates, No accident has happen'd. Some cried out, Some quarrell'd; many horses started off, And bore amid them. Andrea. Never fear. Giovanna. But ask. [He goes. SCENE II. Fiammetta, Maria, Filippa, and Sancia, enter. Maria. The bridegroom is among the other grooms, Asking odd questions: what man's horse broke loose, Who was knockt down, what fruit-stall overturn'd, Who quarrell'd, who cried out, struck, ran away. Giovanna. Maria! this is pleasantry. Andrea (returning hastily). They say, Caraffa and Caraccioli are dead. Giovanna. It can not be: they were both well this morning. Filippa. The west-wind blew this morning . . no air now. Giovanna. O but, Filippa! they both came together. Did not queen Sancia tell you? Filippa. I have seen Two barks together enter the port yonder, And part together. Giovanna. But to die at once! Filippa. Happy the friends whom that one fate befalls! Giovanna. So soon! Filippa. Perhaps so soon. Giovanna. It may be happy. It must be strange; awfully strange indeed! [Fiammetta goes out. Andrea. My darling! how you pity those two youths! I like you for it. Giovanna. Both have fathers living: What must they suffer! Each . . I never heard, But may well fancy . . loved some girl who loves him. I could shed tears for her. Maria. My dear Giovanna! Do queens shed tears? and on the wedding-day? Sancia. I see no reason why they should not. Filippa (aside). I, Alas! see far too many why they should. Andrea. What did Filippa say? that brides should cry? Filippa (to Giovanna and Maria). Not idly has the genial breath of song Turn'd into pearls the tears that women shed; They are what they are call'd: some may be brighter Among your gems, none purer, none become The youthful and the beautiful so well. Andrea (as Fiammetta enters). Here enters one you never will teach that, She is too light for grief, too gay for love, And neither salt nor mistleto can catch her, Nor springe nor net: she laughs at all of them Like any woodpecker, and wings away. I know you women; I'm a married man: Fiammetta. They will not give the story up: they draw All different ways, but death they all will have. Andrea. Ay, and one only will not satisfy them. [An Officer enters, and confers apart with him. Certain? Giovanna. Some other accident less heavy, Heaven! let us hope! Andrea. Strangled! O what a death! One of them . . one (no matter now which of them) Disliked me, shunn'd me; if we met, lookt at me Straighter and taller and athwart the shoulder, And dug his knuckles deep into his thigh. I gave him no offence . . yet, he is gone . . Without a word of hearing, he is gone! To think of this! to think how he has fallen Amid his pranks and joyances, amid His wild heath myrtle-blossoms, one might say, It quite unmans me. Sancia. Speak not so, my son! Let others, when their nature has been changed To such unwonted state, when they are call'd To do what angels do and brutes do not, Sob at their shame, and say they are unmann'd: Unmann'd they can not be; they are not men. At glorious deeds, at sufferings well endured, Yea, at life's thread snapt with its gloss upon it, Be it man's pride and privilege to weep. SCENE III. GRAND SALOON. Masks passing. Andrea, Giovanna, Maria, Fiammetta, Filippa. Filippa. It may be right, my lady, that you know What masks are here. Giovanna. I have found out already A few of them. Several waived ceremony (Desirably at masks) and past unnoticed. . The room fills rapidly. Filippa. Not to detain My queen (for hundreds anxiously approach), Pardon! I recognised the Prince Luigi. Giovanna. Taranto? Tell our cousin to keep on His mask all evening. Hither! uninvited! Maria (out of breath). Think you the dais will keep the masks from hearing? Giovanna. Why should it? Maria. Oh! why should it? He is here Even Filippa could distinguish him. Every one upon earth must know Taranto. Giovanna. Descend we then: beside the statue there We may converse some moments privately. Maria. Radiant I saw him as the sun . . a name We always gave him . . rapid as his beams. I should have known him by his neck alone Among ten thousand. While I gazed upon it, He gazed at three mysterious masks: then rose That graceful column, ampler, and more wreathed With its marmoreal thews and dimmer veins. The three masks hurried thro' the hall; Taranto After them (fierce disdain upon his brow) Darted as Mercury at Jove's command. No doubt, three traitors who dared never face him In his own country, are courageous here. Giovanna. Taranto then, Taranto was unmaskt Against my orders! Maria. Rather say, before. Luigi never disobeyed Giovanna. Giovanna. Filippa carried them. Maria. I know his answer. Giovanna. Repeat it then, for she may not to-night. Maria. “Tell her I come the cousin, not the prince, Nor with pretension, nor design, nor hope; I come the loyal, not the fond, Taranto.” Why look you round? Giovanna. The voice is surely his. Maria. The thoughts are . . Giovanna (pressing her hand). May, O Heaven! the speaker be! [Both walk away. Fra Rupert (masked and disguised, to one next). I heard our gracious queen, espoused to-day, Give orders that Taranto keep well maskt. Next Mask (to another). Ho then! Taranto here! Second Mask. What treachery! Fra Rupert (masked). He could not keep away. Tempestuous love Has tost him hither. Let him but abstain From violence, nor play the jealous husband, As some men do when husbands cross their road. Second Mask. Taranto is a swordsman to the proof. First Mask Where is he? Fra Rupert. He stood yonder, in sky-blue, With pearls about the sleeves. Second Mask. Well call him Phœbus! I would give something for a glimpse at what That mask conceals. Fra Rupert. Oh! could we catch a glimpse Of what all masks conceal, 'twould break our hearts. Far better hidden from us! Woman! woman! [Goes off. First Mask (to second). A friar Rupert! only that his voice Breathes flute-like whisperings, rather than reproofs. Second Mask. Beside, he stands three inches higher; his girth Slenderer by much. First Mask. Who thought 'twas really he? I only meant he talkt as morally. Third Mask (coming up to Fourth). I am quite certain there is Frate Rupert. Fourth Mask. Where is he not? The Devil's ubiquity! But, like the Devil, not well known when met. How found you him so readily? What mark? Third Mask. Stout is he, nor ill-built, tho' the left shoulder Is half a finger's breadth above the right. Fourth Mask. But that man's . . let me look . . That man's right shoulder Stands two good inches highest. Third Mask. Doubt is past . . We catch him! over-sedulous disguise! SCENE IV. Andrea. We have a cousin in the house, my queen! What dost thou blush at? why art troubled? sure We are quite grand enough for him: our supper (I trust) will answer all his expectations. Maria. So you have lookt then at the supper-table? Andrea. 'Twould mortify me if Giovanna's guests Were disappointed. Giovanna. Mine! and not yours too? Andrea. Ah sly one! you have sent then for Taranto And would not tell me! Cousin to us both, To both he should be welcome as to one. Another little blush! Why, thou art mine, And never shalt, if love's worth love, repent it. Giovanna. Never, my own Andrea! for such trust Is far more precious than the wealthiest realms, Or all that ever did adorn or win them. Andrea. I must not wait to hear its value told, We shall have time to count it out together. I now must go to greet our cousin yonder, He waits me in the balcony; the guards Have sent away the loiterers that stood round, And only two or three of his own friends Remain with him. To tarry were uncourteous. Maria (earnestly). I do believe Luigi is below. Andrea. Do not detain me: we have never met Since your proud sister spoke unkindly to him, And, vaulting on his horse, he hurried home. [Goes. Maria. The soldiers there do well to guard the balcony, And close the folding-doors against intrusion. [Cry is heard. Fiammetta. Ha! some inquisitive young chamber-lady, Who watcht Luigi enter, pays for it. Those frolicsome young princes are demanding A fine for trespass. Giovanna. Nay, they are too rude, Permitting any rudeness. Struggles! sobs! Andrea never caused them. Maria. Shame, Taranto! Giovanna. Stifling of screams! Those nearer are alarmed; Those farther off are running for the staircase; And many come this way! What can they mean? See, they look angry as they run, and dash Their hands against their foreheads! [Very alarmed. Where's a page? [A page stands masked in the doorway; crowds of unmasked behind him. Maria. A page! a page! Page (to himself). I am one; and discovered! [Advances. Giovanna. Run; see what those young courtiers round the princes Are doing in the balcony. Below; Not there. Page. I might mistake the Prince Andrea, Not having ever seen him. Maria. Who then are you. Page. The Prince Luigi's page, whom I awaited, To say his groom and horse are near at hand. Maria. He goes then? Page. Ere it dawn. Giovanna. O! hasten! hasten Below, and instantly run back again, Reporting me what you can discover there. Page (returns). Lady! the lamps about the balcony Are all extinguisht. Giovanna. Is the wind so high? What didst thou hear, what didst thou note, beside? Page (hesitating). Against the gentlest, the most virtuous queen, Opprobrious speech, threats, imprecations . . Giovanna. Pass it. Page. Upon the stairs; none from the gardens. Giovanna. There What sawest thou? Page. Over the balcony Downward some burden swang. Giovanna. Some festive wreath Perhaps. Page. Too heavy; almost motionless. Maria. Several damask draperies thrown across. Page. May-be. The wind just stirr'd the bottom of them: I had no time to look: I saw my prince Fighting. Maria. O heaven! was ever night like this . . Page. For gallant sword! it left two proofs behind: The third man, seeing me (poor help for arm So valiant!) fled. Maria. O! we are safe then, all. [Very joyous. Page. No cap lost they, nor did the one who fled: Whose in the world of Naples, can be this? [He takes from under his richly embroidered cloak the cap of Andrea. Giovanna clasps it to her face, and falls with a stifled scream. [Another Page brings in Andrea's ermine cloak. This cloak fell near me from the balusters. Maria. His own! Ha! this dark speck is not the ermine's. Filippa. See! she revives! Hide it away! O guests Of our unhappy festival, retire. GIOVANNA OF NAPLES. CHARACTERS. Lewis, King of Hungary. Luigi, Prince of Taranto. Acciajoli, Seneschal of Naples. Ugo del Balzo. Spinello, General of Naples. Rienzi, Tribune of Rome. Fra Rupert. Boccaccio. Petrarca. Psein, a Hungarian Captain. Pope's Nuncio. Prior of the Celestines. Wife of Rienzi. Filippa of Catania. Sancia, her Granddaughter. Princess Maria. Fiammetta. ACT I. SCENE I. GARDEN OF CAPO-DI-MONTE. Boccaccio and Fiammetta. Boccaccio. Adieu the starlit gardens of Aversa, The groves of Capo-Monte! Fiammetta. Why adieu? Boccaccio. One night will throw its gloom upon them long. Fiammetta. It will indeed, but love can dwell in gloom, And not repine in it. Boccaccio. The generous man, Who might have much impeded ours, gave way To bitter impulses. My face is flusht To think of his hard doom, and find myself Happy where he was happy, and so lately! Fiammetta. I too have sighs, nor for thee only, now. Giovanna, had an angel told it me The other day, I should have disbelieved. We all are now alike. Even queen Sancia, Whose sadness is scarce sadness, so resign'd Is she to Heaven, at this balustrade Lean'd and lookt over, hearing some one sing. “Impatient is the singer there,” said she, “To run thro' his delight, to fill the conch Of song up to the brim, and wise were he Thought he not, O my child, as think he might, How every gust of music, every air, Breathing its freshness over youthful breasts, Is a faint prelude to the choirs above, And how Death stands in the dark space between, To some with invitations free and meek, To some with flames athwart an angry brow; To others holds green palm and aureole crown, Dreadless as is the shadow of a leaf . .” But, while she said it, prest my hand and wept, Then prayed of Heaven its peace for poor Andrea. Boccaccio. We may think too as wisely as the queen When we attain her age; of other flames And other palms and other crowns just now. Like every growth, thoughts also have their seasons; We will not pluck unripe ones; they might hurt us. That lady then was with you? Fiammetta. She herself Led me up hither by the sleeve. Giovanna Is there below, secure, in Castel-Nuovo. Look you! what crowds are gathering round about it. Boccaccio. I see them, and implore you, my Fiammetta, To tarry here, protected by queen Sancia. Fiammetta. And will you tarry near me? Boccaccio. While the queen Your sister is quite safe. Fiammetta. What! thinkest thou She ever can be otherwise than safe? I will run down to her. Boccaccio. There is no danger At present; if there should be, my weak aid Shall not be wanting. He whom she laments I too lament: this bond unites me with her; And I will keep her in my sight, and follow (As lighter birds follow the powerfuller) Where'er the tempest drives her . . not to save, But break the fall, or warn her from below. Fiammetta. Generously spoken, my own sweet Giovanni! Do so, and I can spare you; but remember Others may want a warning too, may want Some one to break a fall, some one to save . . . Giovanni! O Giovanni! to save what? For what is left but love? . . save that, Giovanni! Boccaccio. Were any infelicity near you, Crowns and their realms might perish: but your sister Is part of you: had she but lookt into Your cradle, and no more; had one kind word, And only one, fallen from her upon you; My life should be the price for it. Fiammetta. Your life! We have but one, we two. But until she Is safe again, and happier, you shall keep it. Go, go then; follow her; but soon return. While you are absent from me, shapeless fears Must throng upon and keep awake my sorrow. Boccaccio. To grieve for what is past, is idle grief, Idler to grieve for what may never be. Courage! when both most wish it, we shall meet. SCENE. II. CASTEL-NUOVO. Giovanna and Del Balzo. Giovanna. Ugo del Balzo! thou art just and firm. Seek we the murderers out, and bring them forth Before their God and fellow-men, if God Or fellow-men have they. Spare none who did This cruel deed. The partner of my throne, Companion of my days . . until that day . . Avenge! In striking low the guilty head Show mercy to my people. Take from me And execute with promptness this commission. O what a chasm in life hath one day made, Thus giving way with such astounding crash Under my feet, when all seem'd equable, All hopeful, not a form of fear in sight. Del Balzo. Lady! if all could see the pangs within Which rend your bosom, every voice would pause From railing and reproach. Giovanna. Reproach who will, Rail who delight in railing. Could my arm Protect the innocent? Del Balzo. But strange reports (With this commission in my hand I speak it) Murmur throughout the city. Kindred, ay, Close kindred are accused. Giovanna. Such accusations Have burst upon my ear: they wrong my cousin. A man more loyal than the brave Taranto Nor court nor field e'er saw: but even he Shall not escape if treachery be found Within the shadow of that lofty mien. Del Balzo. No, by the sword of the archangel! no . . Altho' his sister smiles this hour upon Her first-born of my dear and only brother The Duke of Andria. Thou must weep, Francesco! And she and I; for such dishonour taints The whole house through, obscuring past and future. Was he not in Aversa? Giovanna. He was there. Del Balzo. And were no orders given that he keep on His mask all evening? Giovanna. Yes, I gave those orders. Del Balzo. The Queen's commission reaches not the Queen. Giovanna. Imperfect then is that commission, Ugo! Del Balzo. Freedom of speech is limited. Giovanna. By what? Del Balzo. The throne. Giovanna. For once then push the throne more back, And let thy words and actions have their scope. Del Balzo. Why was Aversa chosen for the revels? [The Queen hesitates and sighs deeply. One answer comes from all. Because the town Is Norman, the inhabitants are Norman, Sworn enemies to an Hungarian prince; The very name sounds hostilely; the walls Built in aversion to the pride of Capua. Giovanna. I could give other answer, which such hearts Would little understand. My happiest days Were spent there . . O that there my last had closed! Was it not in Aversa we first met? There my Andrea, while our friends stood round At our betrothment, fain would show me first A horse they led for him from Hungary. The hands we join'd were little hands indeed! And the two rings we interchanged would ill Let pass the bossy chain of his light hair Entwisted with my darker, nor without His teeth were then drawn through it. Those were days When none saw quarrels on his side or mine, Yet were there worse than there were latterly, Or than since childhood ever. We have lived From those days forth without distrust and strife. All might have seen but now will not know that. Del Balzo. Lady! the court and people do remember That none more courteous, none more beautiful, Lives than the Prince Luigi . . they acknowledge That Prince Andrea's qualities fell short . . Giovanna. Del Balzo! cease! he was your prince but now . . His virtues were domestic . . few saw those. Del Balzo. Few, I confess it; not so few the other's. His assiduities, his love. Giovanna. Do these Remember too, whate'er advantages The Prince Luigi of Taranto had, I gave my hand where they who rear'd me will'd, That no contention in our family Might reach my people? Ugo! tell me now To whom show'd I my love? To them or him? Del Balzo. Lady! 'twas nobly done. Yet he was seen To walk among the maskers on that night, Was ordered to keep on his mask, was known To watch Andrea in the balcony, To rush away, to fight below the place Where the inhuman deed was perpetrated, And then to fly. Giovanna. Oh! if Taranto could Be guilty! . . but impossible! My sister Saw him pursue three masks: and his own page Found him in fight with one, where two were slain. Del Balzo. Would any court receive such testimony? Giovanna. Examine then more closely. I am lost, Not in conjectures, for my mind flies off From all conjecture, but in vague, in wild Tumultuous thoughts, all broken, crost, and crazed. Go, lose no moment. There are other things [Del Balzo goes. I could have said . . what were they? . . there are things . . Maria . . why not here! . . She knows there are . . O! were the guilty so perplext as I am, No guilt were undiscover'd in the world! SCENE III. Filippa, Sancia Terlizzi, Del Balzo. Sancia Terlizzi. Gentle and gracious and compassionate, Companion and not queen to those about her, Giovanna delegates her fullest powers To stern Del Balzo; and already force Enters the palace gates. Filippa. Let them be closed Against all force. Send for the seneschal. Sancio Terlizzi. Acciajoli has departed for Aversa, There to make inquest. Filippa. Who dares strike the door? Del Balzo (entering). The laws. Filippa. Count Ugo! is the queen extinct? Del Balzo. The prince is. Therefore lead with due respect These ladies, and the rest, away. [To an Officer. Filippa. What means This violence? Del Balzo (to the Officer). Let none, I pray, be used. [To Filippa. Behold the queen's commission! In that chamber Where close examinations must ensue, In clear untroubled order let your words Leave us no future violence to be fear'd. Filippa (returning the paper). The queen hath acted as she always acts, Discreetly; bravely; it becomes her race And station: what becomes a faithful subject Let us do now. [The Queen enters. Sancia Terlizzi. Turn: lo, the queen herself! Del Balzo. Lady! there is one chamber in the realm, And only one, and that but for one day, You may not enter. Giovanna. Which is that, Del Balzo? Del Balzo. Where the judge sits against the criminal. Giovanna. Criminal! none are here. Del Balzo. If all my wishes Avail'd me, there were none. Giovanna. Sure, sure, the palace Is sacred. Del Balzo. Sacred deeds make every place Sacred, unholy ones make all unholy. Giovanna. But these are our best friends. Filippa. My royal mistress! The name of friendship and the name of justice Should stand apart. Permit me to retire . . [To Del Balzo. Whither, sir, you must dictate. Del Balzo. Lead them on. [The Queen throws her arms round Filippa who gently removes them and goes. Lady! would you protect the culpable? Giovanna. Ugo del Balzo! would you wrong the queen? Del Balzo. I recognise the lofty race of Robert, And my arm strengthens and my heart dilates. Giovanna. Perform your duty, sir, and all your duty; Win praise, win glory . . mine can be but tears. [Goes. SCENE IV. Fra Rupert, Del Balzo. Fra Rupert. Confessionals are close; and closer still The heart that holds one treasure. Del Balzo. Father Rupert! What brought thee hither at this busy hour? Fra Rupert. My duty: I must not delay my duty. Del Balzo. What is it? Fra Rupert. I would fain absolve from sin (Far as the Church allows) the worst of sinners. Del Balzo. In few plain words, who sent for thee? Fra Rupert. In fewer, I scorn thy question. Del Balzo. Father! thou must wait. The prince's death involves some powerful ones, Whose guilt or innocence shall presently Be ascertained. Fra Rupert. What! and shall man hear first The guilty soul confess its secret sin? Shall not the angels carry up the tale Before the people catch it? Del Balzo. They, no doubt, Already have done this. Fra Rupert. Not half, not half. Del Balzo. Father! it seems thou knowest more about it Than I or any else. Why reddenest thou? Fra Rupert. Dost think, Del Balzo, any word escapes The sanctuary of consciences? the throne Of grace and mercy on our earth below? The purifier, the confessional? So then! some powerful ones are apprehended For what they did! O merciful Del Balzo! Be sparing of a woman's blood, Del Balzo! And age hath claims upon our pity too; And so hath youth, alas! and early ties Suddenly broken shock far round about. Beside; who knows . . thou canst not certainly . . If any can . . they may be innocent, Each of the three, one more, one less, perhaps: Innocent should be all whose guilt lacks proof. O my poor child Andrea, pardon me! Thou wouldst not have sought blood for blood, Andrea! Thou didst love all these women! most of all Her . . but there's justice, even on earth, Andrea! [Goes. Del Balzo. 'Tis so! that stern proud bosom bursts with grief. SCENE V. Maria. Ah, why, Del Balzo, have you let come in The filthy monk, Fra Rupert? He has frightened Sancia Terlizzi almost into fainting. And tell me by what right hath he or any Ordered her up into her room, and taken Her mother down below, into those chambers Which we have always been forbid to enter! Del Balzo. Perhaps to ask some questions; for the queen Ought to be satisfied. Maria. Then let me go And ask her: she would tell me in a moment What they will never get from her. Del Balzo. Perhaps, O princess! you may have mistaken. Maria. No: I never was mistaken in Filippa. Rudeness can neither move nor discompose her: A word, a look, of kindness, instantly Opens her heart and brings her cheek upon you. Del Balzo. The countess has more glorious qualities Than noble birth has given any else. Whether her heart has all that tenderness . . Maria. Is my heart tender. Del Balzo. Be it not too tender, Or it may suffer much, and speedily, And undeservedly. The queen your sister, Gentle as you, hath fortitude. Maria. Giovanna Is tenderer than I am; she sheds tears Oftener than I do, though she hides them better. Del Balzo. I saw their traces: but more royally Never shone courage upon grief opprest. Maria. The lovely platane in the garden-walk Catches the sun upon her buds half-open, And looks the brightest where unbarkt and unscathed. O find them out who have afflicted her With that most cruel blow. Del Balzo. 'Tis what she bade me, And what I now am hastening to perform. [Goes. Giovanna enters. Maria. Courage, Giovanna! courage, my sweet sister! Del Balzo will find out those wicked men. O! I forgot to tell him what assistance Fra Rupert might afford him. Every crime Is known to him. But certainly Fra Rupert, Who loved Andrea so, will never cease Until he find the slayer of his friend. Ah my poor sister! if you had but heard The praises of Del Balzo, you would soon Resume your courage and subdue your tears. Giovanna. Before Del Balzo, sister, I disdain To show them or to speak of them. Be mine Hid from all eyes! God only knows their source, Their truth or falsehood. In the light of day Some lose their bitterness, run smoothly on, And catch compassion, leisurely, serenely: Never will mine run thus: my sorrows lie In my own breast; my fame rests upon others, Who throw it from them now the blast has nipt it. 'Tis ever so. Applauses win applauses, Crowds gather about crowds, the solitary Are shunned as lepers, and in haste past by. Maria. But we will not be solitary; we Are not so easy to pass by in haste; We are not very leper-looking. Giovanna. Cease, Maria! nothing on this earth so wounds The stricken bosom as such sportiveness, Or weighs worn spirits down like levity. Give me your hand . . Reproof is not reproach. I might have done the same . . how recently! Maria. Hark! what is all that outcry? Giovanna. 'Tis for him Whom we have lost. Maria. But angry voices mixt With sorrowful? Giovanna. To him both due alike. Spinello enters. Spinello. Hungarian troops throng every street and lane, Driving before them the infirm, the aged, The children, of both sexes. Giovanna. Shelter them. Spinello. Such is the hope of those base enemies, That, unprovided for defence, the castle May fall into their hands: and very quickly (Unless we drive them back) our scanty stores Leave us exhausted. Giovanna. Dost thou fear, Spinello? Spinello. I do: but if my sovran bids me bare This breast of armour and assail her foes, Soon shall she see what fears there lie within. Giovanna. Let me too have my fears, nor worse than thine, Loyal and brave Spinello! Dare I ask Of God my daily bread nor give it those Whose daily prayers have earned it for us all? I dare not. Throw wide open every gate And stand between the last of my poor people And those who drive them in. Spinello. We then are lost. Giovanna. Not from God's sight, nor theirs who look to God. Maria. O sister! may that smile of yours be parent Of many. It sinks back, and dies upon The lovely couch it rose from. [Del Balzo enters.] I will go; Del Balzo looks, I think, more stern than ever. Giovanna. Del Balzo, I perceive thou knowest all, And pitiest my condition. [Del Balzo amazed. Spinello. Standest thou, Lookest thou, thus, before thy sovran, sir? Giovanna. Be friends, be friends, and spare me one affront. Wiser it were, and worthier, to devise How tumults may be quell'd than how increast. On your discretion lies your country's weal. [Goes. Spinello. Ugo del Balzo! thou art strong in war, Strong in alliances, in virtue strong, But darest thou, before the queen, before The lowest of the loyal, thus impute With brow of scorn and figure fixt aslant, Atrocious crimes to purity angelic? Del Balzo. Heard'st thou her words and askest thou this question? Spinello! nor in virtue nor in courage (Our best alliances) have I pretence To stand before thee. Chancellor thou art, And, by the nature of thy office, shouldst Have undertaken my most awful duty: Why didst thou not? Spinello. Because the queen herself Will'd otherwise; because her chancellor, She thought, might vindicate some near unduly. Del Balzo. She thought so? what! of thee? Spinello. Thus it appears. But on this subject never word escaped Her lips to me: her own pure spirit frankly Suggested it: her delicacy shunn'd All explanation, lacking no excuse. Thou askest if I heard her at thy entrance: I heard her, like thyself. The words before Thou didst not hear; I did. Her last appeal Was for the wretched driven within the castle, And doom'd to pine or force us to surrender. For them she call'd upon thee, never else, To pity her condition. Del Balzo. Pardon me! I have much wrong'd her. Yet, among the questioned Were strange confessions. One alone spake scornfully Amid her tortures. Spinello. Is the torture, then, The tongue of Truth? Del Balzo. For once, I fear, 'tis not. Spinello. It was Giovanna's resolute design To issue her first edict through the land Abolishing this horrid artifice, Whereby the harden'd only can escape. “The cruel best bear cruelty,” said she, “And those who often have committed it May once go through it.” Del Balzo. And would'st thou, Spinello! Thus lay aside the just restraints of law, Abolishing what wise and holy men Raised for the safeguard of society? Spinello. The holy and the wise have done such things As the unwise and the unholy shrink at. Del Balzo. It might be thought a hardship in a country Where laws want ingenuity; where scales, Bandage, and sword, alone betoken Justice. Ill-furbisht ineffective armoury, With nothing but cross-shooting shafts of words! Spinello. Since every deed like torture must afflict A youthful breast, so mild, so sensitive, Trust it to me, and we will then devise How the event may best be laid before her. Del Balzo. A clue was given by unwilling hands, Wherewith we entered the dark narrow chambers Of this strange mystery. Filippa first, Interrogated if she knew the murderer, Denied it: then, if she suspected any; “I do,” was her reply. Whom? She was silent. Where should suspicion now (tell me, Spinello!) Wander or fix? I askt her if the Queen Was privy to the deed. Then swell'd her scorn. Again I askt her, and show'd the rack. “Throw me upon it; I will answer thence,” Said with calm voice Filippa. She was rackt. Screams from all round fill'd the whole vault. “See, children! How those who fear their God and love their Prince Can bear this childish cruelty,” said she. Although no other voice escaped, the men Trembled, the women wail'd aloud. “To-morrow,” Said I, “Filippa! thou must answer Justice. Release her.” Still the smile was on her face: She was releast: Death had come down and saved her. Spinello. Faithfullest friend of the unhappy! plead For us whose duty was to plead for thee! Thou art among the Blessed! On, Del Balzo! Del Balzo. Sancia, her daughter's child . . Spinello. The playful Sancia? Whose fifteenth birthday we both kept together . . Was it the sixth or seventh of last March? . . Terlizzi's bride two months ago? Del Balzo. The same. Spinello. And the same fate? Del Balzo. She never had seen Death: She thought her cries could drive him off again, Thought her soft lips might have relaxt the rigid, And her warm tears . . Spinello. Del Balzo! wert thou there? Or tearest thou such dreamery from some book, If any book contain such? Del Balzo. I was there; And what I saw I ordered to be done. Justice would have it; Justice smote my heart, Justice sustained it too. Spinello. Her husband would Rather have died than hear one shriek from Sancia. Del Balzo. So all men would: for never form so lovely Lighted the air around it. Spinello. Let us go And bear her home. Del Balzo. To me the way lies open; But much I fear, Spinello, the Hungarians Possess all avenue to thy escape. Spinello. Escape is not the word for me, my friend. I had forgotten the Hungarians (It seems) the Queen, myself, captivity . . I may not hence: relate then if more horrors Succeeded. Del Balzo. When Terlizzi saw Filippa Lie stiff before him, and that gentle bride Chafing her limbs, and shrinking with loud yells Whenever her soft hand felt some swol'n sinew, In hopes to finish here and save all else, He cried aloud, “Filippa was the murderess.” At this she darted at him such a glance As the mad only dart, and fell down dead. “'Tis false! 'tis false!” cried he. “Speak, Sancia, speak! Or hear me say 'tis false.” They dragg'd away The wavering youth, and fixt him. There he lies, With what result of such inconstancy I know not, but am going to inquire . . If we detect the murderers, all these pains Are well inflicted. Spinello. But if not? Del Balzo. The Laws Have done their duty and struck fear through all. Spinello. Alas! that duty seems their only one. Del Balzo. Among the first 'tis surely. I must go And gather up fresh evidence. Farewell, Spinello. Spinello. May good angels guide your steps! Farewell! That Heaven should give the merciless So much of power, the merciful so little! ACT II. SCENE I. CASTEL-NUOVO. Giovanna and Maria. Maria. I do not like these windows. Who can see What passes under? Never were contrived Cleverer ones for looking at the sky, Or hearing our Hungarians to advantage. I can not think their songs are pastorals; They may be; if they are, they are ill-set. Will nothing do, Giovanna? Raise your eyes; Embrace your sister. Giovanna. So, you too, Maria! Have turgid eyes, and feign the face of joy. Never will joy be more with us . . with you It may be . . O God grant it! but me! me, Whom good men doubt, what pleasure can approach? Maria. If good men all were young men, we might shudder At silly doubts, like other silly things Not quite so cold to shudder at. Giovanna. Again, Maria! I am now quite changed; I am Your sister as I was, but O remember I am (how lately!) my Andrea's widow. Maria. I wish our little Sancia would come hither With her Terlizzi . . those inseparables! We scarcely could get twenty words from them All the day long; we caught them after dinner, And lost them suddenly as evening closed. Giovanna. Send for her. But perhaps she is with Filippa. . . Maria. Learning sedateness in the matron life. Giovanna. Or may-be with the queen whose name she bears, And who divides her love, not equally With us, but almost equally. Maria. If so, No need to seek her; for the queen went forth To San Lorenzo at the dawn of day, And there upon the pavement she implores Peace for the dead, protection for the living. Giovanna. O may her prayers be heard! Maria. If piety Avails the living or the dead, they will. Giovanna. How, how much calmer than thy sweetest smile Has that thought made me! Evermore speak so, And life will almost be as welcome to me As death itself. Maria. When sunshine glistens round, And friends, as young as we are, sit beside us, We smile at Death . . one rather grim indeed And whimsical, but not disposed to hurt us . . And give and take fresh courage. But, sweet sister! The days are many when he is unwelcome, And you will think so too another time. 'Tis chiefly in cold places, with old folks, His features seem prodigiously amiss. But Life looks always pleasant, sometimes more And sometimes less so, but looks always pleasant, And, when we cherish him, repays us well. Sicily says it is the worst of sin To cast aside what God hath given us, And snatch at what he may hereafter give In its due season . . scourges, and such comfits, Cupboarded for Old-age. Youth has her games; We are invited, and should ill refuse. On all these subjects our sweet Sicily Discourses with the wisdom of a man. You are not listening: what avails our wisdom? Giovanna. To keep afloat that buoyant little bark Which swells endanger. O may never storm O'ertake it! never worm unseen eat thro'! Maria. I wish we were away from these thick walls, And these high windows, and these church-like ceilings, Without a cherub to look down on us, Or play a prank up there, with psalter-book, Or bishop's head, or fiddle, or festoon. Giovanna. Be satisfied awhile: the nobler rooms Are less secure against the violence Of those Hungarians. Maria. I saw one who bowed Graceful as an Italian. “Send away The men below,” said I, “then bow again, And we will try which bows most gracefully.” Giovanna. My giddy, giddy sister! Maria. May my head Be ever so, if crowns must steady it! Giovanna. He might have thought . . Maria. Not he; he never thinks. He bowed and shook his head. His name is Psein. Often hath he been here on guard before: You must remember him. Giovanna. No, not by name. Maria. Effeminate and vain we fancied him, Because he always had a flower in hand, Or with his fingers combed his forehead hair. Giovanna. No little merit in that sullen race. Maria. If he has merit I will bring it out. Giovanna. Resign that idle notion. Power is lost By showing it too freely. When I want His services, I order them. We part. Too large a portion of the hour already Has been among the living. Now I go To other duties for the residue Of this sad day. Maria. Unwelcome is Maria Where sorrow is? Giovanna. Her sorrow is unwelcome; Let me subdue my own; then come and join me. Thou knowest where the desolate find one Who never leaves them desolate. [Goes. Maria. 'Tis hard To linger here alone. Officer. The Seneschal Of Naples. Acciajoli. SCENE II. Acciajoli and Maria. Acciajoli. By command Of our most gracious queen, O royal lady! I come for yours. Maria. That is, to bear me company. Acciajoli. Such only as the humblest bear the highest. Maria. Seneschal! you excell the best in phrases. You might let others be before you there, Content to shine in policy and war. Acciajoli. I have been placed where others would have shone. Maria. Come, do not beat me now in modesty. Had I done anything, I might not boast, Nor should I think I was improving it By telling an untruth and looking down. I do not like our lodgment, nor much wish To see an arrow quivering in that wainscot: The floors are well enough; I would not see them Paved with smooth pebbles from Hungarian slings. Can not you send those soldiers to their quarters? Acciajoli. In vain have I attempted it. Maria. Send Psein To me. Acciajoli. He, like the rest, is an insurgent. Civilest of barbarians, yet may Psein (With horror I must utter it) refuse. Maria. Fear of refusal has lost many a prize. [Acciajoli goes. I hope the Seneschal will go himself, Not send another. How I wisht to ask it! But, at my years, to hint an act of delicacy Is too indelicate. He has seen courts, Turn'd over their loose leaves (each more than half Illumination, dulness the remainder), And knows them from the cover to the core. SCENE III. Psein conducted by Acciajoli, who retires. The queen commands my presence here. Maria. The queen Desires your presence; I alone command it. Eyes have seen you, commander Psein! Psein. Impossible! Maria. Yes, eyes have seen you, general Psein! they have, And seen that they can trust you. Psein. By my troth To all that's lovely! Maria. Ah, sad man! swear not . . Unless you swear my words. Psein. To hear and swear And treasure them within this breast, is one. Maria (Psein repeating). “I swear to love and honour and obey” . . Ha! not the hand . . it comes not quite so soon . . Psein. I have but little practice in the form; Pardon me, gracious lady! Maria. Earn your pardon By your obedience. Now repeat again. “Whatever perils may obstruct her path, I give safe-conduct to my royal mistress, Giovanna, queen of Naples.” (He starts.) Have you taken Me for my sister all this while? I told you It was not she commanded you, 'twas I. Psein. Oaths are sad things! I trot to church so seldom They would not let me out of mine for little (Not they!) like any good old customer. Maria. And so! you would deceive me, general? Psein (aside). I am appointed! that sounds well: but general! She said the same before: it must be true. Maria. Tell me at once, nor hesitate. Another May reap the harvest while you whet the sickle. Psein. But I have sworn to let none pass, before The will of my superiors be announced. Maria. Behold them here! their shadow fills this palace, And in my voice, sir, is their will announced. Psein. I swore. Maria. I heard you. Psein. But before. Maria. Before Disloyalty, now loyalty. Are brave And gallant men to ponder in the choice? Psein. Devoted as I am to you, O lady! It can not be. Maria. Is that the phrase of Psein? We love the marvellous; we love the man Who shows how things which can not be can be. Give me this glove again upon the water, And queen Giovanna shall reward you for it. Psein. Upon the water or upon the fire, The whirlpool or volcano . . By bad luck (What fools men are! they always make their own!) The troops are in revolt. Pride brightens zeal But not invention. How shall we contrive To manage them at present? Maria. Tell the troops We will have no revolts. Sure, with your powers Of person and persuasion, not a man Would hesitate to execute his duty. Psein. We are but three . . Maria. We are but two: yet, Psein! When two are resolute they are enough. Now I am resolute, and so are you, And if those soldiers dare to disobey It is rank mutiny and halbert-matter. Await the Seneschal: he now returns. [Goes. Psein. She knows the laws of war as well as I, And looks a young Minerva, tho' of Naples. SCENE IV. Acciajoli and Psein. Acciajoli. Sorrow and consternation are around. Psein. Men could not have cried louder had they lost Policinello, who begets them fun, While princes but beget them blows and taxes. When will they see things straightly, and give these Their proper station? Acciajoli. Have you not your king? Psein. O! quite another matter! We have ours, True; but his taxes are for us; and then The blows . . we give and take them, as may happen. Acciajoli. We too may do the same, another day. [Psein expresses contempt. So! you imagine that your arms suffice To keep this kingdom down! War is a game Not of skill only, not of hazard only, No, nor of both united. Psein. What the ball Is stuft with, I know not, nor ever lookt; I only know it is the very game I like to play at. Acciajoli. Many are the chances. Psein. Without the chances I would throw it up. Play me at Naples only five to one, I take the odds. Acciajoli. All are not Neapolitans. Psein. Then strike off three. Acciajoli. Some Normans. Psein. Then my sword Must be well whetted and my horse well fed, And my poor memory well poked for prayers. And, hark ye! I should like one combatant As well as twenty, of that ugly breed. Lord Seneschal, be ready at your post. Acciajoli. I trust I shall be. Psein. At what hour? Acciajoli. Not yet. Psein. Ay, but the queen must fix it. Acciajoli. She inclines To peace. Psein. I know it; but for flight ere peace. Acciajoli. Flight is not in the movements of our queen. Psein. Departure then. Acciajoli. Sir! should she will departure, Breasts are not wanting to repell the charge Of traitor or intruder. Psein. Here is one, Lord Seneschal! as ready to defend her As any mail'd with iron or claspt with gold. Doubtest thou? Doubt no longer. [Shows the glove. Acciajoli. Whose is that? Psein. The names we venerate we rarely speak; And love beats veneration out and out. I will restore it at the vessel's side, And ask it back again when she is safe And the less happy lady whom you serve. It then behoves me to retrace my steps And rally my few countrymen for safety. SCENE V. A Herald enters. Psein goes. Acciajoli. Whence come you, sir? Herald. From Gaeta. Acciajoli. What duty? Herald. To see the queen. Acciajoli. The queen you can not see: Her consort died too lately. Herald. Therefore I Must see the queen. Acciajoli. If you bring aught that throws Light upon that dark treason, speak at once. Herald. The light must fall from Rome. Cola Rienzi, Tribune of Rome, and arbiter of justice To Europe, tarrying on the extremest verge Of our dominions, to inspect the castles, Heard the report, brought with velocity Incredible, which man gave man along The land, and ship gave ship along the coast. Acciajoli. Then 'twas prepared: and those who spread the news Perpetrated the deed. Herald. Such promptitude. Could not escape the Tribune. He demands The presence of Giovanna queen of Naples, To plead her cause before him. Acciajoli. Is Rienzi A king? above a king? Herald. Knowest thou not Rienzi is the tribune of the people? Acciajoli. Sir! we have yet to learn by what authority He regulates the destiny of princes. Herald. The wisest men have greatly more to learn Than ever they have learnt: there will be children Who in their childhood shall know more than we do. Lord Seneschal! I am but citizen In my own city, nor among the first, But I am herald here, and, being herald, Let no man dare to question me. The king Of Hungary is cited to appear, Since in his name are accusations made By some at Naples, which your queen must answer. Acciajoli. Her dignity and wisdom will decide, I am well pleas'd that those around the castle Threw no obstruction in your way. Herald. The soldiers Resisted my approach; but instantly Two holy friars spread out their arms in front, And they disparted like the Red-sea waves, And grounded arms before me. Acciajoli. Then no hindrance To our most gracious queen, should she comply? Herald. None; for Rienzi's name is spell against it. Giovanni (enters). O! is there one to hear me patiently? Let me fly to him! Acciajoli. Hath our sovran heard The order of Rienzi? Giovanna. Call it not An order, lest my people be incenst. Herald. Lady! if plainly hath been understood The subject of my mission, the few words Containing it may be unread by me. Therefore I place them duly in the hands Of the Lord Seneschal. With brief delay Your presence were desirable. Giovanna. What time Return you, sir? Herald. This evening. Giovanna. And by sea? Herald. In the same bark which brought me. Giovanna. If some ship More spacious be now lying at the mole, I will embark in that; if not, in yours, And we will sail together. You have power Which I have not in Naples; and the troops, And those who seem to guide them, hear your words. Herald. Lady! not mine; but there are some they hear. Giovanna. Entreat them to let pass the wretched ones Who fancied I could succour them within, Whom famine must soon seize. Until they pass I can not. Dear is fame to me; but far Be Fame that stalks to us o'er hurried graves. Lord Seneschal! see Rome's ambassador Be duly honoured: then, whatever else Is needful for departure, be prepared. ACT III. SCENE I. ROME. CAPITOL. Rienzi and the Pope's Nuncio. Nuncio. With infinite affliction, potent Tribune! The Holiness of our Lord the Sovran Pontiff Learns that Andrea, prince of Hungary, Hath, in the palace of Aversa, been Traitorously slain. Moreover, potent Tribune! The Holiness of our Lord the Sovran Pontiff, Hears sundry accusations: and, until The guilt or innocence of those accused Be manifested, in such wise as He, The Holiness of our Lord, the Sovran Pontiff Shall deem sufficient, he requires that troops March from his faithful city, and possess Otranto and Taranto, Brindisi And Benevento, Capua and Bari, Most loving cities and most orthodox. And some few towns and villages beside, Yearning for peace in his paternal breast, He would especially protect from tumult. Laying his blessing on your head thro' me The humblest of his servitors, thus speaks The Holiness of our Lord the Sovran Pontiff. Rienzi (seated). Lord Cardinal! no truer stay than me Hath, on Italian or Provenzal ground, The Holiness of our Lord the Sovran Pontiff. The cares that I have taken off his hands The wisdom of his Holiness alone Can measure and appreciate. As for troops, That wisdom, seeing them so far remote, Perhaps may judge somewhat less accurately. The service of his Holiness requires All these against his barons. Now, until I hear the pleas of Hungary and Naples, My balance is suspended. Those few cities, Those towns and villages, awhile must yearn For foreign troops among them; but meantime Having the blessing of his Holiness, May wait contentedly for any greater His Holiness shall opportunely grant. Kissing the foot of his Beatitude, Such, my lord Cardinal, is the reply From his most faithful Cola di Rienzi, Unworthy tribune of his loyal city. Nuncio. We may discuss anew this weighty question On which his Holiness's heart is moved. Rienzi. If allocution be permitted me To his most worthy Nuncio, let me say The generous bosom would enfold about it The friend, the neighbour, the whole human race, And scarcely then rest satisfied. With all These precious coverings round it, poisonous tongues Can penetrate. We lowly men alone Are safe, and hardly we. Who would believe it? People have heretofore been mad enough To feign ambition (of all deadly sins Surely the deadliest) in our lord the pope's Protecting predecessors! Their paternal Solicitude these factions thus denounced. Ineffable the pleasure I foretaste In swearing to his Holiness what calm Reluctance you exhibited; the same His Holiness himself might have exprest, In bending to the wishes of those cities So orthodox and loving; and how fully You manifested, by your faint appeal, You sigh as deeply to decline, as they Sigh in their fears and fondness to attain. [Nuncio going. Help my lord Cardinal. This weather brings Stiffness of joints, rheums, shooting pains. Way there! SCENE II. CAPITOL. Rienzi, Acciajoli, Petrarca, and Boccaccio. Boccacio. If there was ever upon throne one mind More pure than other, one more merciful, One better stored with wisdom, of its own And carried from without, 'tis hers, the queen's. Exert, my dear Francesco, all that eloquence Which kings and senates often have obeyed And nations have applauded. Petrarca. My Boccaccio! Thou knowest Rome, thou knowest Avignon: Altho' so brief a time the slave of power, Rienzi is no longer what he was, Popes are what they have ever been. They all Have families for dukedoms to obey. Boccaccio. O! had each holy father twenty wives And each wife twenty children! then 'twere hard To cut out dukedoms for so many mouths, And the well-furred tiara could not hatch So many golden goose-eggs under it. Petrarca. We must unite our efforts. Boccaccio. Mine could add Little to yours; I am not eloquent. Petrarca. Thou never hast received from any court Favour or place; I, presents and preferments. Boccaccio. I am but little known: for dear to me As fame is, odious is celebrity. Petrarca. I see not why it should be. Boccaccio. If no eyes In the same head are quite alike, ours may Match pretty well, yet somewhat differ too. Petrarca. Should days like yours waste far from men and friends? Boccaccio. Leave me one flame; then may my breast dilate To hold, at last, two (or almost two) friends: One would content me: but we must, forsooth, Speculate on more riches than we want. Moreover, O Francesco! I should shrink From scurril advocate, cross-questioning Whom knew I in the palace? whence my knowledge? How long? where first? whence introduced? for what? Since in all law-courts I have ever entered, The least effrontery, the least dishonesty, Has lain among the prosecuted thieves. Petrarca. We can not now much longer hesitate; He hath his eye upon us. Boccaccio. Not on me; He knows me not. Petrarca. On me it may be then, Altho' some years, no few have intervened Since we last met. Boccaccio. But frequent correspondence Retains the features, nay, brings back the voice; The very shoe creaks when the letter opens. Petrarca. Rienzi was among those friends who sooner Forget than are forgotten. Boccaccio. They who rise Lose sight of things below, while they who fall Grasp at and call for anything to help. Petrarca. I own I cease to place reliance on him. Virtue and Power take the same road at first, But they soon separate, and they meet no more. Usher. The Tribune, ser Franceso! claims your presence. Rienzi. Petrarca! pride of Italy! most welcome! Petrarca. Tribune of Rome! I bend before the fasces. Rienzi. No graver business in this capitol, Or in the forum underneath its walls, Or in the temples that once rose between, Engaged the thoughts of Rome. No captive queen Comes hither, none comes tributary, none Courting dominion or contesting crown. Thou knowest who submits her cause before The majesty that reigns within this court. Petrarca. Her, and her father, and his father knew I, Nor three more worthy of my love and honour (Tho' born to royalty) adorn our earth. Del Balzo hath supplied the facts: all doubts On every side of them hath Acciajoli Clear'd up. Rienzi. But some will spring where others fall, When intellect is strongly exercised. Petrarca. The sources of our intellect lie deep Within the heart; what rises to the brain Is spray and efflorescence; they dry up. Rienzi. However, we must ponder. So then truly, Petrarca! thou dost think her innocent? Petrarca. Thou knowest she is innocent, Rienzi! Write then thy knowledge higher than my belief: The proofs lie there before thee. Rienzi. But these papers Are ranged against them. Petrarca. Weigh the characters Of those who sign them. Rienzi. Here the names are wanting. Petrarca. Remove the balance then, for none is needed. Against Del Balzo, upright, stern, severe, What evidence can struggle? Rienzi. From Del Balzo The Queen herself demands investigation Into the crime, and bids him spare not one Partaker. Petrarca. Worthy of her race! Now ask If I believe her guiltless. Rienzi. May we prove it! Acciajoli. She shall herself, if needful. Should more answers Be wanted from me, I am here before That high tribunal where the greatest power And wisdom are united; where the judge Gives judgment in the presence of such men As Rome hath rarely seen in ancient days, Never in later. What they hear, the world Will hear thro' future ages, and rejoice That he was born in this to raise an arm Protecting such courageous innocence. Rienzi. Lord Seneschal of Naples, Acciajoli! We have examined, as thou knowest, all The documents before us, and regret That death withholds from like examination (Whether as witnesses or criminals) Some inmates of your court, the most familiar With queen Giovanna. Acciajoli. Did she then desire Their death? as hidden enemies accuse her Of one more awful. I presume the names Of the young Sancia, count Terlizzi's bride, And hers who educated that pure mind By pointing out Giovanna, two years older, Filippa of Catana. Rienzi. They are gone Beyond our reach. Acciajoli. Sent off, no doubt, by one Who loved them most, who most loved her! sent off After their tortures, whether into Scotland Or Norway or Laponia, the same hand Who wrote those unsign'd papers may set forth. Rienzi. I cannot know their characters. Acciajoli. I know them Loyal and wise and virtuous. Rienzi. But Filippa Guided, 'tis said, the counsels of king Robert. Acciajoli. And were those counsels evil? If they were, How happens it that both in life and death The good king Robert was his appellation? Rienzi. How many kings are thrust among the stars Who had become the whipping-post much better? Acciajoli. Was Robert one? Rienzi. We must confess that Robert Struck down men's envy under admiration. Acciajoli. If then Filippa guided him, what harm? Rienzi. She might have fear'd that youth would less obey Her prudent counsels than experience did. Acciajoli. Well might she: hence for many a year her cares Have been devoted to our queen's instruction, Together with queen Sancia, not without: And neither of these ladies (I now speak As president) have meddled with our councils. Rienzi. When women of low origin are guides To potentates of either sex, 'tis ill. Acciajoli. I might have thought so; but Filippa showed That female wisdom much resembles male; Gentler, not weaker; leading, not controlling. Again! O tribune! touching low estate. More vigorously than off the downier cradle From humble crib springs up the lofty mind. Rienzi. Strong arguments, and cogent facts, are these! [To an Usher. Conduct the queen of Naples into court. Acciajoli. That, by your leave, must be my office, sir! SCENE III. Rienzi, Acciajoli, Giovanna, and Prior of the Celestines. Rienzi. Giovanna, queen of Naples! we have left you A pause and space for sorrow to subside; Since, innocent or guilty, them who lose So suddenly the partner of their hours, Grief seizes on, in that dark interval. Pause too and space were needful, to explore On every side such proofs as may acquit Of all connivance at the dreadful crime A queen so wise, and held so virtuous, So just, so merciful. It can not be (We hope) that she who would have swept away Playthings of royal courts and monkish cells, The instruments of torture, that a queen Who in her childhood visited the sick, Nor made a luxury or pomp of doing it, Who placed her little hand, as we have heard, In that where fever burnt, nor feared contagion, Should slay her husband. Acciajoli. Faintness overpowers her, Not guilt. The racks you spoke of, O Rienzi! You have applied, and worse than those you spoke of. Rienzi. Gladly I see true friends about her. Acciajoli. Say About her not; say in her breast she finds The only friend she wants . . her innocence. Rienzi. People of Rome! your silence, your attention, Become you. With like gravity our fathers Beheld the mighty and adjudged their due. Sovran of Naples, Piedmont, and Provence, Among known Potentates what other holds Such wide dominions as this lady here, Excepting that strong islander whose sword Has cut France thro', and lies o'er Normandy, Anjou, Maine, Poictou, Brittany, Touraine, And farthest Gascony; whose hilt keeps down The Grampians, and whose point the Pyrenees? Listen! she throws aside her veil, that all May hear her voice, and mark her fearless mien. Giovanna. I say not, O Rienzi! I was born A queen; nor say I none but God alone Hath right to judge me. Every man whom God Endows with judgment arbitrates my cause. For of that crime am I accused which none Shall hide from God or man. All are involved In guilt who aid, or screen, or spare, the guilty. Speak, voice of Rome! absolve me or condemn, As proof, or, proof being absent, probability, Points on the scroll of this dark tragedy. Speak, and spare not: fear nought but mighty minds, Nor those, unless where lies God's shadow, truth. Rienzi. Well hast thou done, O queen, and wisely chosen Judge and defenders. Thro' these states shall none Invade thy realm. I find no crime in thee. Hasten to Naples! for against its throne Ring powerful arms and menace thy return. [Acciajoli leads the Queen out. Prior of the Celestines. Thou findest in that wily queen no crime. So be it! and 'tis well. But tribune, know, Ill chosen are the praises thou bestowest On her immunity from harm, in touching The fever'd and infected. She was led Into such places by unholy hands. I come not an accuser: I would say Merely, that Queen Giovanna was anointed By the most potent sorceress, Filippa The Catanese. Rienzi. Anointed Queen? Prior. Her palms Anointed, so that evil could not touch them. Filippa, with some blacker spirits, helpt To cure the sick, or comfort them unduly. Rienzi. Among the multitude of sorceresses I find but very few such sorceries, And, if the Church permitted, would forgive them. Prior. In mercy we, in mercy, should demur. Rienzi. How weak is human wisdom! what a stay Is such stout wicker-work about the fold! Prior. Whether in realms of ignorance, in realms By our pure light and our sure faith unblest, Or where the full effulgence bursts from Rome, No soul, not one upon this varied earth, Is unbeliever in the power of sorcery: How certain then its truth, the universal Tongue of mankind, from east to west, proclaims. Rienzi. With reverential and submissive awe, People of Rome! leave we to holy Church What comes not now before us, nor shall come, While matters which our judgments can decide Are question'd, while crown'd heads are bowed before us. ACT IV. SCENE I. RIENZI'S OWN APARTMENT IN THE CAPITOL. Rienzi, Friar Anselmo, and poor Neapolitans. Rienzi. Who creeps there yonder with his fingers folded? Hither; what wantest thou? who art thou, man? Anselmo. The humblest of the humble, your Anselmo. Rienzi. Mine? Anselmo. In all duty. Rienzi. Whence art thou? Anselmo. From Naples. Rienzi. What askest thou? Anselmo. In the most holy names Of Saint Euphemia and Saint Cunigund! And in behalf of these poor creatures ask I Justice and mercy. Rienzi. On what count? Anselmo. On life. Rienzi. Who threatens it in Rome? Anselmo. In Rome none dare Under the guardianship of your tribunal. But Naples is abandoned to her fate By those who ruled her. Those, alas! who ruled her Heaven has abandoned. Crimes, outrageous crimes, Have swept them from their people. We alone In poverty are left for the protection Of the more starving populace. O hear, Merciful Tribune! hear their cries for bread! [All cry out. Anselmo (to them). Ye should not have cried now, ye fools! and choak ye! Rienzi. That worthy yonder looks well satisfied: All of him, but his shoulder, seems at ease. Anselmo. Tommaso! art thou satisfied? Tommaso. Not I. A fish upon my bread, at least on Friday, Had done my body and my soul some good, And quicken'd one and t'other at thanksgiving. Anchovies are rare cooks for garlic, master! [To Rienzi. Anselmo. I sigh for such delusion. Rienzi. So do I. How came they hither? Anselmo. By a miracle. Rienzi. My honest friends! what can we do for you At Rome? Anselmo. Speak. Does the Devil gripe your tongues? Mob. We crave our daily bread from holy hands, And from none other. Rienzi. Then your daily bread Ye will eat hot, and delicately small. Frate Anselmo, what means this? Anselmo. It means, O tribune, that the lady, late our queen, Hath set aside broad lands and blooming gardens For hospitals; which, with unrighteous zeal, She builds with every church. There Saint Antonio Beyond the gate of Capua! there Saint Martin On Mount Saint-Eremo! there Saint Maria Incoronata! All their hospitals! No one hath monastery! no one nuns! Rienzi. Hard, hard upon you! But what means were yours To bring so many supplicants so long A journey with you? Anselmo. 'Twas a miracle. Rienzi. Miracles never are of great duration. Hurry them back! Hurry ye while it lasts! I would not spoil it with occult supplies, I reverence holy men too much for that, And leave them to the only power above them. Possibly quails and manna may not cross you If you procrastinate. But, setting out To-morrow, by whichever gate seems luckiest, And questioning your honest mules discreetly, I boldly answer for it, ye shall find By their mild winking (should they hold their tongues) The coin of our lord Clement on the back Of one or other, in some well-thonged scrip. Anselmo (aside). Atheist! Tommaso. Ah no, father! Atheists Never lift up their eyes as you and he do. [Going together. I know one in a twinkling. For example, Cosimo Cappa was one. He denied A miracle his mother might have seen Not twelve miles from his very door, when she Was heavy with him; and the saint who workt it, To make him one, cost thirteen thousand ducats. There was an atheist for you! that same Cappa . . I saw him burnt . . a fine fresh lusty man. I warrant I remember it: I won A heap of chestnuts on that day at morra. A sad poor place this Rome! look where you will, No drying paste here dangles from the windows Across the sunny street, to make it cheerful; And much I doubt if, after all its fame, The nasty yellow river breeds anchovies. SCENE II. RIENZI'S OWN APARTMENT IN THE CAPITOL. Rienzi and his Wife. Rienzi. I have been sore perplext, and still am so. Wife. Yet falsehood drops from truth, as quicksilver From gold, and ministers to purify it. Rienzi. The favour of the people is uncertain. Wife. Gravely thou givest this intelligence. Thus there are people in a northern isle Who tell each other that the weather changes, And, when the sun shines, say the day looks bright, And, when it shines not, there are clouds above. Rienzi. Some little fief, some dukedom, we'll suppose, Might shelter us against a sudden storm. Wife. Not so: we should be crusht between two rocks, The people and the barons. Both would hate thee, Both call thee traitor, and both call thee truly. Rienzi. When we stand high, the shaft comes slowly up; We see the feather, not the point; and that Loses what venom it might have below. Wife. I thought the queen of Naples occupied Thy mind entirely. Rienzi. From the queen of Naples My hopes originate. The pope is willing To grant me an investiture when I Have given up to him, by my decree, Some of her cities. Wife. Then it is untrue Thou hast acquitted her of crime. Rienzi. I did; But may condemn her yet: the king of Hungary Is yet unheard: there are strong doubts: who knows But stronger may arise! My mind misgives. Tell me thou thinkest her in fault. One word Would satisfy me. Wife. Not in fault, thou meanest. Rienzi. In fault, in fault, I say. Wife. No, not in fault, Much less so foully criminal. Rienzi. O! could I Absolve her! Wife. If her guilt be manifest, Absolve her not; deliver her to death. Rienzi. From what the pope and king of Hungary Adduce . . at present not quite openly . . I must condemn her. Wife. Dost thou deem her guilty? Rienzi. O God! I wish she were! I must condemn her. Wife. Husband! art thou gone mad? Rienzi. None are much else Who mount so high, none can stand firm, none look Without a fear of falling: and, to fall! . . No, no, 'tis not, 'tis not the worst disgrace. Wife. What hast thou done? Have thine eyes seen corruption? Rienzi. Thinkest thou gold could move Rienzi? gold (Working incessantly demoniac miracles) Could chain down Justice, or turn blood to water? Wife. Who scorns the ingot may not scorn the mine. Gold may not move thee, yet what brings gold may. Ambition is but avarice in mail, Blinder, and often weaker. Is there strength, Cola! or speed, in the oblique and wry? Of blood turn'd into water talkest thou? Take heed thou turn not water into blood And show the pure impure. If thou do this, Eternal is the stain upon thy hand; Freedom thro' thee will be the proud man's scoff, The wise man's problem; even the slave himself Will rather bear the scourge than trust the snare. Thou hast brought large materials, large and solid, To build thy glory on: if equity Be not the base, lay not one stone above. Thou hast won the influence over potent minds, Relax it not. Truth is a tower of strength, No Babel one: it may be rais'd to heaven And will not anger God. Rienzi. Who doubts my justice? Wife. Thyself. Who prosecutes the criminal? Thyself? Who racks the criminal? Thyself. Unhappy man! how maim'd art thou! what limb Proportionate! what feature undisfigured! Go, bathe in porphyry . . thy leprosy Will never quit thee: thou hast eaten fruit That brings all sins, and leaves but death behind. Rienzi. But hear me. Wife. I have heard thee, and such words As one who loves thee never should have heard. Rienzi. I must provide against baronial power By every aid, external and internal, For, since my elevation, many friends Have fallen from me. Wife. Throw not off the rest. What! is it then enough to stand before The little crags and sweep the lizards down From their warm basking-place with idle wand, While under them the drowsy panther lies Twitching his paw in his dark lair, and waits Secure of springing when thy back is turned? Popular power can stand but with the people: Let them trust none a palm above themselves, For sympathy in high degrees is frozen. Rienzi. Such are my sentiments. Wife. Thy sentiments! They were thy passion. Are they sentiments? Go! there's the distaff in the other room. Rienzi. Thou blamed'st not what seemed ambition in me. Wife. Because it gave thee power to bless thy country. Stood tribunitial ever without right? Sat ever papal without perfidy? O tribune! tribune! whom weak woman teaches! If thou deceivest men, go, next enslave them; Else is no safety. Would'st thou that? Rienzi. To make Any new road, some plants there must be crusht, And not the higher only, here and there. Whoever purposes great good, must do Some partial evil. Wife. Thou hast done great good Without that evil yet. Power in its prime Is beautiful, but sickened by excess Collapses into loathsomeness; and scorn Shrivels to dust its fierce decrepitude. Rienzi. Am I deficient then in manly deeds, Or in persuasion? Wife. Of all manly deeds Oftentimes the most honest are the bravest, And no persuasion so persuades as truth. Rienzi. Peace! peace! confound me not. Wife. The brave, the wise, The just are never, even by foes, confounded. Promise me but one thing. If in thy soul Thou thinkest this young woman free from blame, Thou wilt absolve her, openly, with honour, Whatever Hungary, whatever Avignon, May whisper or may threaten. Rienzi. If my power Will bear it; if the sentence will not shake This scarlet off my shoulder. Wife. Cola! Cola! SCENE III. TRIBUNAL IN THE CAPITOL. Rienzi, Citizens, &amp;c. Citizen. There is a banner at the gates. Rienzi. A banner! Who dares hoist banner at the gates of Rome? Citizen. A royal crown surmounts it. Rienzi. Down with it! Citizen. A king, 'tis said, bears it himself in hand. Rienzi. Trample it in the dust, and drag him hither. What are those shouts? Look forth. Usher (having looked out). The people cry Around four knights who bear a sable flag: One's helm is fashion'd like a kingly crown. Rienzi. Strike off his head who let the accursed symbol Of royalty come within Roman gate: See this be done: then bind the bold offenders. [Lewis of Hungary enters. Who art thou? Lewis. King of Hungary. Rienzi. What brings thee? Lewis. Tribune! thou knowest well what brings me hither. Fraternal love, insulted honour, bring me. Thinkest thou I complain of empty forms Violated to chafe me? thinkest thou 'Tis that I waited in the port of Trieste For invitation to my brother's wedding, Nor invitation came, nor embassy? Now creaks the motive. Silly masquerade Usurpt the place of tilt and tournament; No knight attended from without, save one, Our cousin of Taranto: why he came, Before all earth the dire event discloses. Rienzi. Lewis of Hungary! it suits not us To regulate the laws of chivalry Or forms of embassies. We know there may be Less folly in the lightest festival Than in the sternest and severest war. Patiently have we heard; as patiently Hear thou, in turn, the accused as the accuser; Else neither aid nor counsel hope from me. Lewis. I ask no aid of thee, I want no counsel, I claim but justice; justice I will have, I will have vengeance for my brother's death. Rienzi. My brother too was murdered. Was my grief Less deep than thine? If greater my endurance, See what my patience brought me! all these friends Around, and thee, a prince, a king, before me. Hear reason, as becomes a Christian knight. Lewis. Ye always say to those who suffer wrong, Hear reason! Is not that another wrong? He who throws fuel on a fiery furnace Cries, Wait my signal for it! blaze not yet! Issue one edict more: proclaim, O tribune, Heat never shall be fire, nor fire be flame. Rienzi. King Lewis! I do issue such an edict (Absurd as thou mayest deem it) in this place. Hell hath its thunders, loud and fierce as Heaven's, Heaven is more great and glorious in its calm: In this clear region is the abode of Justice. Lewis. Was it well, tribune, to have heard the cause, Nay and to have decided it, before Both sides were here? The murderess hath departed, And may have won her city from the grasp Of my brave people, who avenge their prince, The mild Andrea. Justice I will have, I will have vengeance. Rienzi. Every man may ask If what I do is well: and angry tones, Tho' unbecoming, are not unforgiven Where virtuous grief bursts forth. But, king of Hungary, We now will change awhile interrogations. I ask thee was it well to bring with thee Into our states a banner that blows up The people into fury? and a people Not subject to thy sceptre or thy will? We knew not of thy coming. When thy friends In Naples urged us to decide the cause, 'Twas in thy name, as guardian to thy brother, Bringing against the queen such accusations, And so supported, that we ordered her To come before us and defend herself. She did it, nor delayed. The cardinal Bishop of Orvieto and the Cardinal Del Sangro on their part, on hers Del Balzo And Acciajoli, have examined all The papers, heard the witnesses, and signed Their sentence under each. These we suggest To the approval of thy chancery. Lewis. Chanceries were not made for murderesses. Rienzi. I am not learned like the race of kings, Yet doth my memory hold the scanty lore It caught betimes, and there I find it written, Not in Hungarian nor in Roman speech, Vengeance is mine. We execute the laws Against the disobedient, not against Those who submit to our award. The queen Of Naples hath submitted. She is free, Unless new proof and stronger be adduced To warrant her recall into my presence. Lewis. Recall'd she shall be then, and proof adduced. Rienzi. We have detected falsehood in its stead. Lewis. I will have justice, come it whence it may. Rienzi. Cecco Mancino! read the law against Those who accuse maliciously or lightly. Mancino. (reads). “Who shall accuse another, nor make good His accusation, shall incur such fine, Or such infliction of the scourge, as that False accusation righteously deserves.” Rienzi. Fine cannot satisfy the wrongs that royalty Receives from royalty. Lewis. Wouldst thou inflict The scourge on kings? Rienzi. The lictor would, not I. Lewis. What insult may we not expect ere long! And yet we fare not worst from demagogues. Those who have risen from the people's fist Perch first upon their shoulders, then upon Their heads, and then devour their addled brain. Rienzi. We have seen such of old. Lewis. Hast thou seen one True to his feeder where power whistled shriller, Shaking the tassels and the fur before him? Rienzi. History now grows rather dim with me, And memory less vivacious than it was: No time for hawks, no tendency to hounds! Lewis. Cold sneers are your calm judgments! Here at Rome To raise false hopes under false promises Is wisdom! and on such do we rely! Rienzi. Wisdom with us is not hereditary, Nor brought us from the woods in ermine-skins, Nor pinned upon our tuckers ere we chew, Nor offered with the whistle on bent knee, But, King of Hungary! we can and do In some reward it and in all revere; We have no right to scoff at it, thou hast. Cecco Mancino! Mancino. Tribune most august! Rienzi (turning his back, and pointing to the eagles over his tribunal). Furl me that flag. Now place it underneath The eagles there. When the king goes, restore it. [Walks down from the tribunal. ACT V. SCENE I. PALACE ON THE SHORE NEAR NAPLES. Giovanna, Acciajoli, Del Balzo, Luigi of Taranto, Knights. Acciajoli. My queen! behold us in your native land And lawful realm again! Giovanna. But other sounds Than greeted me in earlier days I hear, And other sights I see; no friends among them Who guided me in childhood, warn'd in youth, And were scathed off me when that thunderbolt Fell down between us. Are they lost so soon! So suddenly! Why could they not have come? [To Del Balzo. Where is Filippa? where Terlizzi? where Maternal Sancia? Del Balzo. Such her piety, Nor stranger nor insurgent hath presumed To throw impediment before her steps. For friends alike and enemies her prayers Are daily heard among the helpless crowd, But loudest for Giovanna; at which name, Alone she bends upon the marble floor That saintly brow, and stirs the dust with sighs. Giovanna (to Acciajoli). Arms only keep her from me. Whose are yonder? Acciajoli. I recognise Calabrian; Tarantine. Giovanna. Ah me! suspicion then must never cease! Never, without Luigi, Tarantine Arms glitter in the field. Even without him (Which can not be) his troops in my defence Would move again those odious thoughts, among My easy people, guileless and misled. Del Balzo. His duty and his fealty enforce What loyalty and honour would persuade. Taranto is a fief: Taranto's prince Must lead his army where his suzerain Commands, or where, without commanding, needs. Acciajoli. He can not see your city in your absence A prey to lawless fury, worse than war. Del Balzo. Ay, and war too: for those who came as pilgrims And penitents, to kiss the holy frock Of father Rupert, spring up into soldiers; And thus are hundreds added to the guards Which that most powerful friar placed around Him whom we mourn for. Three strong companies (Once only eight score each) are form'd within The conquered city. Canopies of state Covered with sable cloth parade the streets, And crucifixes shed abundant blood Daily from freshened wounds; and virgins' eyes Pour torrents over faces drawn with grief. What saint stands unforgotten? what uncall'd? Unincenst! Many have come forth and walkt Among the friars, many shouted loud For vengeance. Even Luigi's camp stood wavering. Only when first appeared your ship afar, And over the white sail the sable flag, Flapping the arms of Anjou, Naples, Hungary, 'Twas only then the rising mutiny Paus'd, and subsided; only then Luigi, Pointing at that trine pennant, turn'd their rage Into its course. Acciajoli. Perhaps the boat I see Crossing the harbour, may bring some intelligence; Perhaps he may, himself . . Giovanna. No! not before . . No! not at present . . Must I be ungrateful? Never! . . ah, must I seem so? SCENE II. An Old Knight. From the prince Commanding us, O lady! I am here To lay his homage at his liege's feet. He bids me say, how, at the first approach Of that auspicious vessel, which brought hither Before her city's port its lawful queen, His troops demanded battle. In one hour He places in your royal hands the keys Of your own capital, or falls before it. Giovanna. God grant he fall not! O return! return! Tell him there are enow . . without, within . . And were there not enow . . persuade, implore . . Show how Taranto wants him; his own country, His happy people . . they must pine without him! O miserable me! O most ungrateful! Tell him I can not see him . . I am ill . . The sea disturbs me . . my head turns, aches, splits . . I can not see him . . say it, sir! repeat it. Knight. May-be, to-morrow . . Giovanna. Worse, to-morrow! worse! Sail back again . . say everything . . thanks, blessings. Knight. Too late! Those thundering shouts are our assault . . It was unfair without me; it was hard . . Those are less loud. Giovanna. Luigi is repulst! Perhaps is slain! slain if repulst . . he said it. Yes; those faint shouts . . Knight. Lady, they are less loud Because the walls are between him and us. Giovanna (falls on her knees). O! every saint in heaven be glorified! Which, which hath saved him? [Rises.] Yet, O sir! if walls Are between him and us, then he is where His foes are! That is not what you intend? What is it? Cries again! Knight. Not one were heard Had our prince dropt. The fiercest enemy Had shrunk appall'd from such majestic beauty Falling from heaven upon the earth beneath; And his own people with closed teeth had fought. Not for their lives, but for his death: no such Loud acclamation, lady! had been heard, But louder woe and wailing from the vanquisht. Giovanna (aside). Praises to thee, O Virgin! who concealedst So kindly all my fondness, half my fears! Acciajoli. The dust is rising nearer. Who rides hither In that black scarf? with something in his hand Where the sword should be. 'Tis a sword, I see, In form at least. The dust hangs dense thereon, Adhesive, dark. Del Balzo. Seneschal! it was brighter This morning, I would swear for it. Acciajoli. He throws The bridle on the mane. He comes. Del Balzo. He enters . . We shall hear all. SCENE III. Luigi of Taranto (throwing up his vizor). Pardon this last disguise! There was no time to take my vizor off, Scarcely to throw my sword down in the hall. My royal cousin! let a worthier hand Conduct you to the city you have won, The city of your fathers. Giovanna. O Luigi! None worthier, none more loyal, none more brave. Cousin! by that dear name I do adjure you! Let others . . these my friends and ministers . . Conduct me to the city you have won, The city of your fathers, as of mine. Let none who carried arms against the worst Of my own people (for the very worst Have only been misguided) come into it With me, or after. Well thou governest Thy vassals, O Luigi! Be thy dukedom Increast in all the wealth my gratitude Can add thereto, in chases, castles, towns; But hasten, hasten thither! There are duties (Alas! thou knowest like ourselves what duties) I must perform. Should ever happier days Shine on this land, my people will remember, With me, they shine upon it from Taranto. FRA RUPERT. MALE CHARACTERS. Urban, Pope. Butello, his nephew. Charles II., of Durazzo. Otho, husband of Giovanna. Fra Rupert. Maximin. Stephen, a shepherd. Herald. Page. Monk. Chancellor.

ACT I. SCENE I. VATICAN. Urban. Durazzo. Urban. Charles of Durazzo! I have found thee worthy To wear not only ducal coronet, But in that potent, in that faithful hand, To wield the royal sceptre. Durazzo. Holy father! I am half-ready to accept the charge, When it befalls me, studying your content. Urban. So be it. The crown of Naples is now vacant. Durazzo. Good heavens! is then my mother (let me call her Even my mother, by whose bounteousness My fortunes grew, my youth was educated) Giovanna! is she dead? Urban. To virtuous deeds, Like those, she long hath been so. Durazzo. His Beatitude, The predecessor of your Holiness, Who through her hands received his resting-place At Avignon, when Italy rebell'd, Absolved her from that heavy accusation Her enemy the Hungarian brought against her. Urban. I would not make Infallibility Fallible, nor cross-question the absolved, I merely would remove that stumbling-block The kingdom from her. Durazzo. Let another then Aid such attempt. Urban. Anoter shall. Durazzo. Another Nearer in blood is none. Urban. Ere long, Durazzo, I may look round and find one, if not nearer In blood, yet fitter to perform the duties Imposed on him by me. Durazzo. None, holy father! Is fitter. Urban. Easy then are the conditions. I would not place Butello, my own nephew, Altho' deserving, and altho' besought By many of the Neapolitans, By many of the noble and the powerful In every city of that realm, not him, Durazzo! would I place, against thy interests, So high. But haply from thy gratitude Accept I might in his behalf a dukedom Or petty principality, dependent Upon our See or (may-be) independent; For there are some who fain would have things so. We must content the nations of the earth, Whom we watch over, and who look to us For peace and quiet in the world we rule. Why art thou beating time so with thy foot At every word I speak? why look so stern And jerk thy head and rest thy hand on hip? Thou art determin'd on it, art not thou? Durazzo. I can not, will not, move her from her seat, So help me, God! Urban. Impious young man! reflect! I give thee time; I give thee all to-morrow. SCENE II. A STREET IN NAPLES. Maximin. Agatha. Agatha. (to herself). 'Twas he! 'twas father Rupert. Maximin (overhearing). Well! what then? What wouldst thou with him? thou must wait his leisure: I have some business first with father Rupert. Agatha (gazing anxiously). Can it be? can it be? Maximin. Have not men sins As well as women? have not we our shrivers, Our scourers, soderers, calkers, and equippers? Agatha (embracing him). Forbear! O, for the love of God, forbear! Heed him not, Maximin! or he will cast Thy soul into perdition; he has mine. Maximin. And who art thou, good woman? Agatha. That fair name Is mostly given with small courtesy, As something tost at us indifferently Or scornfully by higher ones. Thy sister Was what thou callest her; and Rupert knows it. Maximin. My sister? how! I had but Agatha. Agatha! Agatha. Maximin! we have not met Since that foul day whose damps fell not on thee, But fill'd our father's house while thou wert absent. Thou, brother! brother! couldst not save my peace, Let me save thine. He used to call me daughter, And he may call thee son. Maximin. The very word! He began fathering early: seven years old At most was father Rupert. Holy names Are covered ways. . Agatha. . . To most unholy deeds. Maximin. I see it; say no more: my sword is reddening With blood that runs not yet, but soon shall run. Agatha. Talk not thus loud, nor thus, nor here. Maximin. Cross then Over the way to that old sycamore; The lads have left off playing at pallone. I found out long ago his frauds, his treasons, His murders; and he meditates a worse. Agatha! let me look into thine eyes, Try to be glad to see me: lift them up, Nay, do not drop them, they are gems to me, And make me very rich with only looking. Thou must have been most fair, my Agatha! And yet I am thy brother! Who would think it? Agatha. Nor time nor toil deforms man's countenance, Crime only does it: 'tis not thus with ours. Kissing the seven nails burnt in below Thy little breast, before they well had healed, I thought thee still more beautiful with them. Maximin. Those precious signs might have done better for me. Agatha. Only the honest are the prosperous. Maximin. A little too on that side hath slipt off. Agatha. Recover it. Maximin. How can I? Agatha. Save the innocent. Maximin. But whom? Agatha. Giovanna. Maximin. Is the queen in danger? Agatha. Knowest thou not? Maximin. Hide we away our knowledge; It may do harm by daylight. I stand sentry In many places at one time, and wink, But am not drowsy. Trust me, she is safe. And thou art then our Agatha! 'Twould do Our mother good, were she alive, to find thee; For her last words were, “Agatha, where art thou?” Agatha. Oh! when our parents sorrow for our crimes, Then is the sin complete. Maximin. She sorrows not, And 'tis high time that thou should'st give it over. Agatha. Alas! our marrow, sinews, veins, dry up, But not our tears; they start with infancy, Run on through life, and swell against the grave. Maximin. I must now see Fra Rupert. Come thou after. He shall admit thee. Pelt him with reproaches, Then will I . . Agatha. Brother! not for these came I, But to avert one crime from his o'erladen Devoted head. He hath returned . . Maximin. . . To join Giovanna with Andrea? On with me: We may forbid the banns a second time, Urging perhaps a few impediments. He hath been in some convent o'er the hill, Doing sad penance on Calabrian rye, How then couldst thou have heard about him? how Find he was here in Naples? Agatha. There he should And may have been: of late he was in Buda. Maximin. You met in Buda then? Agatha. Not met. Maximin. How know His visit else, if he was there indeed? Agatha. While thou and Stephen Stourdza tended sheep Together, I was in our mother's sight, And mostly in her chamber; for ill-health Kept her from work. Often did Father Rupert Pray by her, often hear her long confession, Long, because little could be thought of for it. “Now what a comfort would it be to you, If this poor child read better,” said the friar, “To listen while she read how blessed saints Have suffered, and how glorious their reward.” My mother claspt her hands, and “What a comfort!” Echoed from her sick bosom. “Hath she been Confirm'd?” he askt. “Yea, God be prais'd,” sigh'd she. “We may begin then to infuse some salt Into this leaven,” said the friar, well-pleas'd. “The work is righteous: we will find spare hours.” She wept for joy. Maximin. Weep then (if weep at all) Like her. Agatha. Religious tracts soon tost aside, Florentine stories and Sicilian song Were buzz'd into my ears. The songs much pleas'd me, The stories (these he cull'd out from the book, He told me, as the whole was not for maids) Pleas'd me much less; for woman's faults were there. Maximin. He might have left out half the pages, still The book had been a bible in its bulk If all were there. Agatha. To me this well applies, Not to my sex. Maximin. Thou art the best in it. Those who think ill of woman, hold the tongue Thro' shame, or ignorance of what to say, Or rifle the old ragbag for some shard Spotted and stale. On, prythee, with thy story. Agatha. He taught me that soft speech, the only one For love; he taught me to repeat the words Most tender in it; to observe his lips Pronouncing them; and his eyes scorcht my cheek Into deep scarlet. With his low rich voice He sang the sadness of the laurel'd brow, The tears that trickle on the rocks around Valchiusa. “None but holy men can love As thou, Petrarca!” sighed he at the close. Graver the work he brought me next. We read The story of Francesca. Maximin. What is that? Agatha. Piteous, most piteous, for most guilty, passion. Two lovers are condemn'd to one unrest For ages. I now first knew poetry, I had known song and sonnet long before: I sail'd no more amid the barren isles, Each one small self; the mighty continent Rose and expanded; I was on its shores. Fast fell the drops upon the page: he chided: “And is it punishment to be whirl'd on With our beloved thro' eternity?” “Oh! they were too unhappy, too unhappy!” Sobb'd I aloud: “Who could have written this?” “Tenderest of tender maids!” cried he, and claspt me To his hot breast. Fear seiz'd me, faintness, shame. Be calm, my brother! Maximin. Tell then other tale, And skip far on. Agatha. The queen Elizabeth Heard of me at the nunnery where I served; And the good abbess, not much loving one Who spoke two languages and read at night, Persuaded her that, being quick and needy, 'Twould be by far more charitable in her To take me rather than some richer girl, To read by her, and lace her sandals on. I serv'd her several years, to her content. One evening after dusk, her closet-door Being to me at every hour unclosed, I was just entering, when some voice like his, Whispering, but deep, struck me: a glance sufficed: 'Twas he. They neither saw me. Now occurr'd That lately had Elizabeth said more And worse against Giovanna. “She might be Guiltless, but should not hold the throne of Naples From the sweet child her daughter: there were some Who had strong arms, and might again do better In cowl than fiercer spirits could in casque.” Sleepless was I that night, afraid to meet The wretched man, afraid to join the queen. Early she rose, as usual; earlier I. My sunken eyes and paleness were remarkt, And, whence? was askt me. “Those who have their brothers At Naples,” I replied, “most gracious lady, May well be sleepless; for rebellion shakes A throne unsteady ever.” First she paus'd, Then said, with greater blandness than before, “Indeed they may. But between two usurpers What choice? Your brother may improve his fortune By loyalty, and teaching it. You wish To join him I see clearly, for his good; It may be yours: it may be ours: go then, Aid him with prudent counsel: the supply Shall not be wanting, secrecy must not.” She urged my parting: the same hour we parted. SCENE III. RUPERT'S CELL. Rupert. Maximin. Rupert. Thou hast delaid some little, Maximin. Maximin. Frate! I met a woman in the street, And she might well delay me: guess now why. Rupert. Who in the world can guess the why of women? Maximin. She said she knew us both in Hungary. Rupert. I now suspect the person: she is crazed. Maximin. Well may she be, deprived of such a friend. Rupert. No friend was ever mine in that false sex. I am impatient, Maximin. Maximin. Impatient! And so am I. (Maximin throws open the door, and Agatha enters.) Knowest thou this woman, Frate? Rupert. Art thou crazed too? I know her? Not at all. Maximin. And hast thou never known her? never toucht her? I only mean in giving her thy blessing. Rupert. A drunken sailor in a desert isle Would not approach her. Maximin (indignant). Not my sister? Agatha. Scorner! Insulter! (Aside.) He may have forgotten. Can he? He did not see me, would not look at me. Maximin. My sword shall write her name upon thy midrif. Prepare! Agatha. Hold! hold! Spare him yet, Maximin! How could I . . and the man who . . Maximin. Speak it out, Worthless one! Agatha. I am worthless. Let him live! Oh let him live! Maximin. Thou lovest thy betrayer. Agatha. The once beloved are unestranged by falsehood; They can not wholly leave us, tho' they leave us And never look behind. Maximin. Wild! wild as hawk! Rupert (on his knees). Vision of light, of love, of purity! Dost thou revisit on the verge of earth A soul so lost, to rescue it? Enough, Agatha! Do not ask him for my life; No, bid him slay me; bid him quench the days That have in equal darkness set and risen Since proud superiors banisht faithful love. I am grown old; few years are left me, few And sorrowful: my reason comes and goes: I am almost as capable of crimes As virtues. Maximin. By my troth, a hundred-fold More capable. Rupert. Both ('tis Heaven's will) are over. Here let me end my hours: they should have all Been thine; he knows it; let him take them for thee; And close thou here mine eyes where none behold, Forgiving me . . no, not forgiving me, But praying, thou pure soul! for Heaven's forgiveness. Maximin. I will not strike thee on the ground: rise up, Then, when thou risest . . Agatha. Come away, my brother! Rupert. Never, so help me saints! will I rise up: I will breathe out my latest breath before her. Maximin. It sickens a stout man to tread on toads. [Goes. Rupert (rising slowly, and passing a dagger through his fingers). And the stout man might slip too, peradventure. SCENE IV. PALACE NEAR NAPLES. Durazzo. Margarita. Durazzo. The Pope is not averse to make me king. Margarita. Do we not rule already? Durazzo. Rule indeed! Yes, one small dukedom. Any shepherd-dog Might make his voice heard farther off than mine. Margarita. Yet, my sweet Carlo, oftentimes I've heard you, When people brought before you their complaints, Swear at them for disturbing your repose, Keeping you from your hounds, your bird, your ride At evening, with my palfrey biting yours Playfully (like two Christians) at the gate. Durazzo. I love to see my bird soar in the air, My hound burst from his puzzlement, and cite His peers around him to arraign the boar. Margarita. I think such semblances of high estate Are better than the thing itself, more pleasant, More wholesome. Durazzo. And thinks too my Margarita Of the gray palfrey? like a summer dawn His dapper sides, his red and open nostrils, And his fair rider like the sun just rising Above it, making hill and vale look gay. Margarita. She would be only what Durazzo thinks her. Durazzo. Queenly he thinks her: queen he swears to make her. Margarita. I am contented; and should be, without Even our rule: it brings us but few cares, Yet some it brings us: why add more to them? Durazzo. I never heard you talk so seriously. Not long ago I little heeded state, Authority, low voice, bent knee, kist hand: The Pope has proved to me that, sure as any Of the seven sacraments, the only way To rise above temptation, is to seize All that can tempt. Margarita. There must be truth then in it. But what will some men think when you deprive Our aunt of her inheritance? Durazzo. Men think! Do not men always think what they should not? Margarita. We hear so from the pulpit: it must be. But we should never take what is another's. Durazzo. Then you would never take another's child To feed or clothe it. Margarita. That is not my meaning. I am quite sure my aunt has loved me dearly All her life long, and loves me still; she often (Kissing me) said, How like thou art Maria! You know, Durazzo, how she loved my mother. Durazzo. And she loved me no less: and we love her And honour her. Margarita. May we not then obey her? Durazzo. The Pope, who teaches best, says otherwise. Rule has been tedious to her all her reign, And dangerous too. Margarita. Make it less dangerous, make it Less tedious. Durazzo. She has chosen the duke Otho To sit above thy husband, and all else. Margarita. I think my husband is as brave as he. Durazzo. I think so too: yet people doubt. Margarita. Indeed! Durazzo. And doubt they will, unless the truest knight Of Margarita takes to horse, and scours Her grandsire's realm of foreigners like Otho. Margarita. If you do that, you must displease our aunt. Durazzo. Perhaps so: and hast never thou displeas'd her? Margarita. Never; although I sometimes did what might. Durazzo. I can not disappoint the Holy Father. Margarita. Nay, God forbid! But let me no more see her, To hear her tell me all she did for me! I can bear anything but evil tongues. Durazzo. Then let us slink away and live obscurely. [Going. Margarita. Come back again . . Now! would you leave me so? I have been thinking I must think no more About the matter . . and am quite resolved. Durazzo. My sweetest! you have several female cousins; What are they? Margarita. Duchesses. Durazzo. But are they queens? Margarita. No indeed; and why should they be? They queens? Durazzo. I know but one well worthy of the title. Margarita. Now, who can possibly that be, I wonder! Durazzo. She on whose brow already Majesty Hath placed a crown which no artificer Can render brighter, or fit better, she Upon whose lip Love pays the first obeisance. [Saluting her. Margarita. I know not how it is that you persuade So easily . . not very easily In this, however: yet, if but to tease And plague a little bit my sweet dear cousins, Writing the kindest letters, telling them That I am still, and shall be, just the same, Their loving cousin; nor in form alone; And if I write but seldom for the future, 'Tis only that we queens have many cares Of which my charming cousins can know nothing. Durazzo. What foresight, friendliness, and delicacy! Margarita. Nothing on earth but these, in the idea Of vexing . . no, not vexing . . only plaguing (You know, love! what I mean) my sweet dear cousins, Could make me waver . . and then you, sad Carlo! Durazzo. To please me . . Margarita. Now, what would you have me say? SCENE V. NAPLES. Page, Giovanna, Agnes, Maximin. Page. Fly, O my lady! Troops are near the city. Giovanna. There always are. Page. But strangers. People say Durazzo . . Giovanna. What of him? Agnes. Now then confess I knew him better. No reports have reacht us These several days: the roads were intercepted. Giovanna. I will fear nothing: Otho watches over us. Insects, that build their tiny habitations Against sea-cliffs, become sea-cliffs themselves. I rest on Otho, and no storm can shake me. Agnes. How different this Durazzo! Giovanna. All men are: But blame not without proof, or sign of proof, Or accusation, any man so brave. Page. Lady! his soldiers on Camaldoli Wave the green banner and march hitherward. Giovanna (after a pause). It can not be! my Carlo! my Carlino! What! he who said his prayers with hands comprest Between my knees, and would leap off to say them? Impossible! He may have been deterred From helping me: his people, his advisers, May have been adverse . . but . . make war upon me! O they have basely slandered thee, my Carlo! Agnes. He has been with the Holy Father lately. Giovanna. This would relieve me from all doubt, alone. Agnes. So kind as you have been to him! a mother! Giovanna. Remind me not of any benefit I may have done him: tell me his good deeds, Speak not (if some there may have been) of mine: 'Twould but disturb the image that has never Yet fallen from my breast, and never shall. He was my child when my own child indeed, My only one, was torn away from me. Agnes. And you have brooded o'er a marble egg, Poor darkling bird! Giovanna. O Agnes! Agnes! spare me. Let me think on . . how pleasant 'twas to follow In that Carlino, in that lovely boy, The hidings of shy love, its shame, its glee, Demurest looks at matters we deem light, And, well worth every lesson ever taught, Laughter that loosens graver, and that shakes Our solemn gauds into their proper place. Maximin (out of breath). The castle-gates are open for one moment . . Seize them and enter . . Crowds alone impede Durazzo, and not arms. Agnes. Do you believe His treason now? Giovanna. Peace, peace! 'tis hard, 'tis hard! ACT II. SCENE I. RUPERT'S CELL. Rupert and Maximin. Rupert (alone). I've dogged him to the palace: there's some treachery. Giovanna . . and that witch, too, Agatha . . Why not all three together? Sixty miles From Naples there is Muro. Now, a word Was dropt upon it. We must be humane. But, one more trial first to make him serve In 'stablishing the realm. I fain must laugh To think what creatures 'stablish realms, and how. (Maximin enters.) Well, Maximin! We live for better days And happier purports. Couldst thou not devise Something that might restore the sickened state, And leave our gracious king the exercise Of his good will, to give them companies Who now are ensigns? Ah brave Maximin! I do remember when thou wert but private. Psein, Klapwrath, Zinga, marcht, and made thee way. Nothing in this our world would fain stand still. The earth we tread on labours to set free Its fires within, and shakes the mountain-heads; The animals, the elements, all move, The sea before us, and the sky above, And angels on their missions between both. Fortune will on. There are whom happiness Makes restless with close constancy; there are Who tire of the pure air and sunny sky, And droop for clouds as if each hair were grass. No wonder then should more aspiring souls Be weary of one posture, one dull gloom All the day through, all the long day of life. Maximin (gapes). Weary! ay am I. Can I soon be captain? Rupert. Why not? Maximin. And then what service? Rupert. Queen Giovanna Is blockt up in the castle, as thou knowest; Was not my counsel wise, to keep thee out? Famine had else consumed thee; she spares none. Charles of Durazzo, our beloved king, Presses the siege; and, when the queen gives up, Thou art the man I prophesy to guard her. There are some jewels: lightly carried in, A thousand oxen cannot haul them forth; But they may drop at Muro, one by one, And who should husband them save Maximin? Maximin (pretending alarm). I will not leave my sister out of sight: She ne'er must fall again. Rupert. Forefend it, heaven! I might be weak! She would indeed be safe Where the queen is! But who shall have the heart To shut her up? What has she done? Her brother Might be a comfort to her; and the queen And some few ladies trust her and caress her. But, though the parks and groves and tofts around, And meadows, from their first anemones To their last saffron-crocuses, though all Open would be, to her, if not to them, And villagers and dances, and carousals At vintage-time, and panes that tremble, partly By moon-ray, partly by guitar beneath, Yet might the hours, without street-views, be dull. Maximin. Don't tell her so. Get her once there. But how? Beside, the queen will never trust Hungarians. There would be mortal hatred. Is there fire Upon the hearth? Rupert. None. Maximin. Why then rub your hands? SCENE II. CASTEL-NUOVO. Giovanna and Agnes. Giovanna. 'Tis surely wrong that those who fight for us So faithfully, so wretchedly should perish; That thriftless jewels sparkle round your temples While theirs grow dank with famine. Agnes. Now I see, O my poor queen! the folly of refusal, When they had brought us safety. Giovanna. Not quite that, To me at least, but sustenance and comfort To our defenders in the castle here. Agnes. Will you now take them? Giovanna. If some miracle Might turn a jewel to a grain of corn, I would: my own were kneaded into bread In the first days of our captivity. Agnes. And mine were still withholden! Pardon me, Just Heaven! Giovanna. In words like those invoke not Heaven. If we say just, what can we hope? but what May we not hope if we say merciful? Agnes. And yet my fault is very pardonable. We, at our time of life, want these adornments. Giovanna. We never want them. Youth has all its own; None can shed lustre upon closing days, Mockers of eyes and lips and whatsoever Was prized; nor can they turn one grey hair brown, But, skilfully transmuted, might prolong The life and health and happiness of hundreds. Agnes. Queens may talk so. Giovanna. Not safely, but to friends. Agnes. With power and pomp . . Giovanna. Behold my pomp, my power! These naked walls, cold pavement, grated windows. Agnes. Let me share these with you. Take all my jewels. Giovanna. Forbear, forbear, dear Agnes! Agnes. Earth then, take them! [Throwing them from her. SCENE III. CASTEL-NUOVO. Durazzo. Rupert. Giovanna. Agnes. Durazzo. Upon my knees I do entreat of you To hear me. In sincerity, the crown (Now mine) was forced upon me. Giovanna. Carlo! Carlo! Know you what crowns are made of? Durazzo (rising). I must wear one, However fitly or unfitly made. Giovanna. The ermine is outside, the metal burns Into the brain. Durazzo. Its duties, its conditions, Are not unknown to me, nor its sad cares. Giovanna. 'Tis well Maria my sweet sister lives not To see this day. Durazzo. But Margarita lives, Her beauteous daughter, my beloved wife. She thinks you very kind who let her go And join me, when strange rumours flew abroad And liars call'd me traitor. Giovanna. With my blessing She went, nor heard (I hope) that hateful name. Durazzo (negligently). My cousin Agnes! not one word from you? Agnes. Charles of Durazzo! God abandons thee To thy own will: can any gulph lie lower! Durazzo. 'Twas not my will. Agnes. No! Durazzo. What I did, I did To satisfy the people. Agnes. Satisfy Ocean and Fire. Durazzo. The Church too. Agnes. Fire and Ocean Shall lie together, and shall both pant gorged, Before the Church be satisfied, if Church Be that proud purple shapeless thing we see. Durazzo (to Rupert) Show the pope's charter of investiture. Rupert. 'Tis this. May it please our lady that I read it. Giovanna (to Durazzo). Reasons where there are wrongs but make them heavier. Durazzo (to Agnes). When the whole nation cries in agony Against the sway of Germans, should I halt? Agnes. No German rules this country; one defends And comforts and adorns it: may he long! The bravest of his race, the most humane. Durazzo. Quell'd, fugitive, nor Germany nor France Afford him aid against us. Giovanna. Sir! he hoped No aid from France. Agnes. Does any? What is France? One flaring lie, reddening the face of Europe. Durazzo. French is Provenza. Agnes. There our arts prevail, Our race: no lair of tigers is Provenza. I call that France where mind and soul are French. Durazzo. Sooner would he have graspt at German arms. Giovanna. God hold them both from Italy for ever! Durazzo. She shall want neither. The religious call Blessings upon us in long-drawn processions. Agnes. Who are the men you please to call religious? Sword-cutlers to all Majesties on earth, Drums at the door of every theatre Where tragedies are acted: that friar knows it. Rupert. Such is the fruit of letters sown in courts! Peaches with nettle leaves and thistle crowns! Upon my faith! kings are unsafe near them. Durazzo (to Agnes). May-be we scarcely have your sanction, lady? Am I one? Agnes. No. Durazzo. What am I? Agnes. What! an ingrate. Durazzo (scoffingly). Is that to be no king? You may rave on, Fair cousin Agnes: she who might complain Absolves me. Agnes. Does the child she fed? the orphan? The outcast? does he, can he, to himself, And before us? Durazzo. I, the king, need it not. Agnes. All other blind men know that they are blind, All other helpless feel their helplessness. SCENE IV. UNDER CASTEL-NUOVO. Durazzo and Rupert. Rupert. Remarkt you not how pale she turn'd? Durazzo. At what? Rupert. I said kings were unsafe. She knew my meaning. Durazzo. No man alive believes it: none believed it, Beside the vulgar, when Andrea died. Rupert. Murdered he was. Durazzo. Mysteriously. Some say . . Rupert. What do some say? Durazzo. I never heeded them. I know thee faithful: in this whole affair I've proved it. He who goes on looking back Is apt to trip and tumble. [Goes. Rupert (alone). Why this hatred? Are there no memories of her far more pleasant? I saw her in her childish days: I saw her When she had cast away her toys, and sate Sighing in idleness, and wishing more To fall into her lap; but what? and how? I saw her in the gardens, still a child, So young, she mockt the ladies of the court, And threw the gravel at them from her slipper, And ran without if they pursued, but stopt And leapt to kiss the face of an old statue Because it smiled upon her: then would she Shudder at two wrens fighting, shout, and part them. Next came that age (the lovely seldom pass it) When books lie open, or, in spite of pressing, Will open of themselves at some one place. Lastly, I saw her when the bridal crown Entwined the regal. Oh! that ne'er these eyes Had seen it! then, Andrea! thou had'st lived, My comfort, my support. Divided power Ill could I brook; how then, how tolerate Its rude uprooting from the breast that rear'd it! And must I now sweep from me the last blossoms That lie and wither in the walk of life? Fancies! . . mere fancies! . . let me cease to waver. Who would not do as I did? I am more A man than others, therefore I dare more, And suffer more. Such is humanity: I can not halve it. Superficial men Have no absorbing passions: shallow seas Are void of whirlpools. I must on, tho' loath. SCENE V. PALACE-GARDEN. Maximin and Agatha. Maximin. Courage! or start and leave me. Sobs indeed! Pack those up for young girls who want some comfits. Nay, by my soul, to see grown women sob it, As thou dost, even wert thou not my sister, Smites on me here and whets my sword at once. It maddens me with choler . . for what else Can shake me so? I feel my eyes on fire. He shall pay dear for it, the cursed Frate. Agatha. Why, Maximin, O why didst thou consent To meet the friar again? Maximin. To make him serve thee. Agatha. Poverty rather! want . . even infamy. Maximin Did'st thou not pity, would'st not serve, the queen? Agatha. O might I! might I! she alone on earth Is wretcheder: my soul shall ever bend Before that sacredest supremacy. Maximin. Come with me: we will talk about the means. Agatha. But, be thou calm. Maximin. A lamb. He little thinks [Aside. To see the lamb turn round and bite the butcher. Agatha! Agatha! while I repeat Thy name again, freshness breathes over me. What is there like it? Why, 'tis like sweet hay To rest upon after a twelve hours' march, Clover, with all its flowers, an arm's length deep. SCENE VI. NAPLES. PALACE OF BUTELLO. Butello and Rupert. Butello (reads). “We, Urban, by the grace of God . .” Rupert. Well, well; That is all phrase and froth; dip in the spoon A little deeper; we shall come at last To the sweet solids and the racy wine. Butello. Patience, good Frate, patience! Rupert. Now, Butello, If I cried patience, wouldst not thou believe I meant delay? So do not cry it then. Read on . . about the middle. That will do . . Pass over love, solicitude, grief, foresight, Paternal or avuncular. Push on . . There . . thereabout. Butello. Lift off thy finger, man, And let me, in God's name, read what wants reading. Rupert. Prythee be speedy . . Where thou seest my name . . Butello (reads). “If that our well-beloved Frate Rupert Shall, by his influence thereunto directed By the blest saints above, and the good will Which the said Frate Rupert ever bore us, Before the expiration of one month, So move the heart of Carlo of Durazzo That the said Carlo do invade and seize . . Rupert. What would his Holiness have next? Butello. Wait, wait. “Naples, a kingdom held by our permission . . Rupert. Ho! is that all? 'Tis done. Butello. Hear me read on. “From those who at this present rule the same . . Rupert. This present is already past. I've won. Butello. “And shall consign a princely fief thereof, Hereditary, to our foresaid nephew Gieronimo Butello, We, by power Wherewith we are invested, will exalt Our trusty well-beloved Frate Rupert Unto the highest charge our Holy Church Bestows upon her faithful servitors.” Rupert. Would not one swear those words were all engrossed, And each particular letter stood bolt-upright, Captain'd with taller at the column-head? What marshall'd files! what goodly companies! And, to crown all, the grand heaven-sent commission Seal'd half-way over with green wax, and stiff With triple crown, and crucifix below it. Give me the paper. Butello. Why? Rupert (impatient). Give me the paper. Butello. His Holiness hath signed it. Rupert. Let me see. Butello. Look. Rupert. Nay but give it me. Butello. A piece of paper! Rupert. . . Can not be worth a principality. Butello (giving it). There then. Rupert. What dukedom has the grandest sound? Butello. Dukedom! the Pope says principality. Rupert. Thou soon shalt blazon. Butello. I rely on you: Adieu, my lord! Rupert. My prince, adieu! (Alone.) Who knows If this will better me! Away from court? No; never. Leave the people? When he leaves it, The giant is uplifted off the earth And loses all his strength. My foot must press it. Durazzo, in things near, is shrewd and sighted: I may not lead him. If I rule no more This kingdom, yet ere long my tread may sound Loud in the conclave, and my hand at last Turn in their golden wards the keys of heaven. SCENE VII. CASTLE OF MURO. Giovanna and Agatha. Giovanna. Both mind and body in their soundest state Are always on the verge of a disorder, And fear increases it: take courage then. Agatha. There is an error in the labyrinth Of woman's life whence never foot returns. Giovanna. Hath God said that? Agatha. O lady! man hath said it. Giovanna. He built that labyrinth, he led that foot Into it, and there left it. Shame upon him! I take thee to my service and my trust. To love the hateful with prone prudent will Is worse than with fond unsuspiciousness To fall upon the bosom of the lovely, The wise who value us, the good who teach us, The generous who forgive us when we err. Agatha. Oh! I have no excuse. Giovanna. She stands absolved Before her God who says it as thou sayst it. I have few questions for thee: go, be happier. I owe thy brother more than I can pay, And would, when thou hast leisure, hear what chance Rais'd up a friend where the ground seem'd so rough. Agatha. Leave me no leisure, I beseech of you: I would have cares and sorrows not my own To cover mine from me: I would be questioned, So please you, I may else be false in part, Not being what eyes bedim'd with weeping see me. Giovanna. You come, 'tis rumour'd here, from Hungary. My infant was torn from me by his uncle And carried into Hungary. Agatha. I saw it. Giovanna. Saw it! my infant! to have seen my infant, How blessed! Was it beautiful? strong? smiling? Agatha. It had mild features and soft sunbright hair, And seem'd quite happy. Giovanna. No, poor thing, it was not; It often wanted me, I know it did, And sprang up in the night and cried for me, As I for it . . at the same hour, no doubt. It soon soon wasted . . And you saw my child! I wish you would remember more about him . . The little he could say you must remember . . Repeat it me. Agatha. Ah lady! he was gone, And angels were the first that taught him speech. Giovanna. Happier than angels ever were before! Agatha. He happier too! Giovanna. Ah! not without his mother! Go, go, go . . There are graves no time can close. ACT III SCENE I. NAPLES. PALACE. Durazzo. Rupert. Herald. Officers. Durazzo. I thought I heard a trumpet. But we reel After we step from shipboard, and hear trumpets After we ride from battle. 'Twas one. Hark! It sounds again. Who enters? Officer. Please your Highness! A herald claims admittance. Durazzo. Let him in. Rupert. Now for disguises; now for masks; steel, silk; Nothing in these days does but maskery. Pages talk, sing, ride with you, sleep beside you, For years: behold-ye! some fine April-day They spring forth into girls, with their own faces, Tricks, tendernesses . . . ne'er a mark of saddle! (Herald enters.) Bacco! this is not one of them, however! Durazzo. Well, sir, your message. Herald. Herald from duke Otho, I bring defiance and demand reply. Durazzo. I know duke Otho's courage, and applaud His wisdom. Tell duke Otho from king Carlo, I would in his place do the very same: But, having all I want, assure your lord I am contented. Rupert. Blessed is content. Durazzo. Now, should duke Otho ever catch the reins (For all things upon earth are changeable) He can not well refuse the turn he tries, But will permit me to contend with him For what at present I propose to keep. Herald. If then your Highness should refuse the encounter, Which never knight, and rarely king, refuses . . Durazzo. Hold, sir! All kings are knights. The alternative? Herald. None can there be where combat is declined. He would not urge in words the queen's release, But burns to win it from a recreant knight. Durazzo. Did Otho say it? Herald. Standing here his herald, I have no voice but his. Durazzo. You may have ears: Hear me then, sir! You know, all know at Naples, The wife and husband are as near at present As ever, though the knight and lady not. She, when she married him, declined his love, And never had he hers: Taranto won it, And, when he squandered it, 'twas unretrieved. Herald. Is this, sir, for my ears or for my voice? My voice (it is a man's) will not convey it. Durazzo [to guards]. Escort the herald back with honours due. [To Rupert. What think you, my lord bishop of Nocera? Rupert. Troublesome times! troublesome times indeed! My flock, my brethren at Nocera, will, Must want me: but how leave my prince, a prey To tearing factions, godless, kingless men! Durazzo. Never mind me, good father! Rupert. Mind not you? I can not go; I would not for the world. Durazzo. The world is of small worth to holy men. Rupert. I will not hence until the storm be past. Durazzo. After a storm the roads are heavier. Courage! my good lord bishop! We must speed And chaunt our Veni Domine at Nocera. Rupert. Then would your Highness . . Durazzo. Not corporeally, But, where my bishop is, I am in spirit. [Goes. Rupert (alone). So! this is king . . and wit too! that's not kingly. Can he be ignorant of who I am? They will show fragments of this sturdy frock, Whence every thread starts visible, when all The softer nappery, in its due descent, Drops from the women, Carlo, to the moths. SCENE II. APARTMENT IN THE CASTLE OF MURO. Maximin and Agatha. Maximin. How fares thy lady? Agatha. As one fares who never Must see the peopled earth, nor hear its voice Nor know its sympathy; so fares Giovanna; But, pure in spirit, rises o'er the racks Whereof our world is only one vast chamber. Maximin. Dost thou enjoy the gardens, fields, and forests? Agatha. Perfectly. Maximin. Hast a palfrey? Agatha. Had I ever? Reading and needlework employ the day. Maximin. Ah! our good mother little knew what pests Those needles and those books are, to bright eyes; Rivals should recommend them, mothers no. We will ride out together. Agatha. On what horses? Maximin. One brought me. Are the queen's at grass? Agatha. We have none. Maximin. Thou art hale, Agatha, but how enjoy Perfectly, as thou sayest, these domains? Agatha. By looking out at window with the queen. Maximin. All the day thro'? Agatha. I read to her: and then, If she suspects it tires me, she takes up The volume, and pretends great interest Just there, and reads it out. Maximin. True history? Agatha. History she throws by. Maximin. Then sweet-heart songs, Adventures? Agatha. Some she reads, and over some Tosses her work, rises, and shuts the cover. Maximin. I would not shut the song-book. There are others That show within them gold-and-purple saints, Heads under arm, eyes upon platter, laughing At her who carries them and lately wore them. Agatha. Such are not wanting. Maximin. Pleasant sights enough! I would fain see them. Agatha. Quite impossible. Maximin. On feast-days? Agatha. All are in her bedroom-closet. Maximin. So! the best books then must be out of sight, As all the best things are! What are her pictures? Agatha. Chiefly her own lost family, and those She loved the most in it. Maximin. O for a glimpse! Tell me at least who are they. Agatha. Good king Robert, Whose face she often kisses. Maximin. None more worth it? Agatha. There are the two Marias: one elate With merriment, her eyes orbs wing'd with flame; Long deep and dark the other's, and within Whose cooler fountains blissfully might bathe A silenter and (haply) purer love. Maximin. I should be glad to look at them, but rather At the kind queen herself. Agatha. That thou mayest do. Maximin. When? Agatha. Now; I think; for having heard who 'twas That warned her of her danger when the duke Rode in, she wisht to thank thee. Come with me: I must first enter and announce your name. Maximin. I thought you said she knew it. Take your course. SCENE III. CHAMBER AT MURO. Giovanna. Maximin. Agatha. Giovanna. Accept my too few thanks, sir, for your zeal . . Maximin. Fine air, my lady queen, in this high tower; Healthy as Hungary; may you enjoy it These many days! Giovanna (bending). I fancied Hungary Was moister, leveler, than hereabout. Maximin. We have a plain in Hungary on which, Just in the middle, all of Italy's You shall pin down nor see them from the sides. And then what cattle! horse, ox, sheep! God's blessing Upon hard-working men, like furlough soldiers, And rare sport at the foray, when the Turk Might seize them if we sent them not to quarters. Here too seems nothing wanting. [Looking round. Giovanna. A few friends Were welcome, could they but return, whose pen And conversation lighten'd former hours. Maximin. Learned ones; ay? Giovanna. The learned came around me. Maximin. Whistle, and they are at the barley-corns, Wing over wing, beak against beak, I warrant. I knew two holy friars, as holy men As ever snored in sackcloth after sinning, And they were learned. What now was the upshot? I should have said one's crucifix was white, The other's black. They plied mild arguments In disputation. Brother, was the term At first, then sir, then nothing worse than devil. But those fair words, like all fair things, soon dropt. Fists were held up, grins in the face grew rife, Teeth (tho' in these one had the better of it By half a score) were closed like money-boxes Against the sinner damn'd for poverty. At last the learned and religious men Fell to it mainly, crucifix in hand, Until no splinter, ebony or linden, Was left, of bulk to make a toothpick of. Agatha. Brother! such speech is here irreverent. Giovanna. Let him speak on: we are not queens all day. Soldiers are rivals of the hierarchs, And prone to jealousy, as less at ease, Less wealthy, and, altho' the props of power, Less powerful and commanding. Maximin. Never queen Spoke truer. I bear lusty hate to them. Agatha. Again? O Maximin! before our princes We never hate nor love. Maximin. Then, lady, I Am your worst vassal. Giovanna. How? Maximin. Being taught to hate you . . God pardon me! None but the frockt could teach So false a creed. But now the heart let loose Swings quite the other way. Folks say they love Their princes: sure they must have wrong'd them first. I turned away mine eyes from your young beauty, And muttered to my beard, and made it quiver With my hard breathing of hard thoughts: but now Conspirators shall come in vain against you: Here is the sill they tread upon who enter. [Striking his breast. SCENE IV. RUPERT'S CLOISTER. Rupert (alone). Fëalty sworn, should I retract so soon? I will live quiet . . no more crimes for me . . When this is fairly over . . for a crime It surely is . . albeit much holier men Have done much worse and died in odour after. They were spare men, and had poor appetites, And wanted little sleep. 'Twont do with me. Beside, I must get over this bad habit Of talking to myself. One day or other Some fool may read me, mark me, and do hurt. And furthermore . . when highest dignities Invest us, what is there to think about? What need for cleverness, wit, circumspection, Or harm to any . . who keep still, submiss, And brush not in attempting to pass by. SCENE V. Stephen enters. So, Stephen! we Hungarians are sent off. Stephen. Your Reverence is made bishop, we hear say: As for us all . . Rupert. Lupins . . when times are good. Ah! thou hast bowels; thou canst pity others. Stephen. I can myself. Rupert. I all my countrymen. I have been lately in that happy realm Our native land. [Whispers. Her kings should govern here. Stephen. And everywhere. What loyal subject doubts His prince's right o'er all other princes? Rupert. Here are sad discontents. The prince Butello, Nephew of His Beatitude the Pope, Can not yet touch this principality. Durazzo, our sharp king, snatches it back, Altho' the kingdom was bestowed on him Under this compact. Stephen. He will bring down bull And thunder on his crown. The pope's own nephew! Rupert. No less a man. Stephen. If there's pope's blood in He won't stand robbery. Rupert. We owe obedience To kings . . unless a higher authority Dissolves it. Stephen. Doubtless: but what kings? our own Say I. Rupert. O Stephen! say it, say it softly. Few ears can open and can close like mine. Stephen (aside). Ah! how good men all over are maligned! Rupert. I would not trust another soul on earth . . But others must be trusted. Lucky they Who first bring over to right ways the brave, First climb the pole and strip the garland off With all its gold about it. Then what shouts! What hugs! what offers! dowers, in chests, in farms . . Ah! these are wordly things too fondly prized! But there are what lie deeper; the true praise Of loyalty, of sanctity. Stephen (pondering). 'Tis pleasant To look into warm chest with well-wrought hinges, That turn half-yearly. Pleasant too are farms When harvest-moons hang over them, and wanes Jolt in the iron-tinged rut, and the white ox Is call'd by name, and patted ere pull'd on. Rupert. These are all thine. I have lived many days And never known that man unprosperous Who served our holy church in high emprize. Stephen. If so, I wish I could. Rupert. Wish we had kings Who keep their words like ours of Hungary. Stephen. Just. Rupert. I have half a mind to let Elizabeth Know what a zealous subject, what a brave, Her daughter has at Naples. Stephen. Would she give me (For thanks in these hard times are windy) money? Think you? Rupert. Don't squander all away. Few know Its power, its privilege. It dubs the noble, It raises from the dust the man as light, It turns frowns into smiles, it makes the breath Of sore decrepitude breathe fresh as morn Into maternal ear and virgin breast. Stephen. Is that all it can do? I see much farther. I see full twenty hens upon the perch, I see fat cheese moist as a charnel-house, I see hogs' snouts under the door, I see Flitches of bacon in the rack above. Rupert. Rational sights! fair hopes! unguilty wishes! I am resolved: I can refrain no longer: Thou art the man for prince to rest upon, The plain, sound, sensible, straightforward man, No courtier . . or not much of one . . but fit To show courts what they should be. Hide this letter. Mind! if thou losest it, or let'st an eye Glance on it, I may want the power again To serve thee: thou art ruin'd. The new king Might chide and chafe should Rupert ask another To forward any sent he would prefer For friend or kindred. Since thou must return To Hungary, thou shalt not go ill-fed. 'Tis to the queen's confessor; look at it; Now put it up; now, godson of our Saint! Take this poor purse, and, honest soul! this blessing. Guides thou shalt have all the first day, and rules How to go forward on the road: so speed thee! ACT IV. SCENE I. CASTLE OF MURO. Giovanna, Agatha. Giovanna. Long have we lived in one imprisonment; Our tears have darkened many a thread about Each distaff, at the whitening half-spent fire On winter-night; many a one when deep purple Cloth'd yonder mountain after summer-day, And one sole bird was singing, sad though free. Death, like all others, hath forgotten me, And grief, methinks, now growing old, grows lighter. Agatha. To see you smile amid your grief, consoles me. Giovanna. I never wanted confidence in you, Yet never have I opened my full mind, Keeping some thoughts secreted, altho' bent To draw them out before you. They have lain Like letters which, however long desired, We cover with the hand upon the table And dare not open. Agatha. If relief there be, Why pause? if not, why blame your diffidence? Giovanna. Fostered too fondly, I shot up too tall In happiness: it wasted soon. Taranto Had my first love; Andrea my first vow, And warm affection, which shuts out sometimes Love, rather than embraces it. To lose him Pained me, God knows! and worse (so lost!) than all The wild reports Hungarians spread about me. My first admirer was my first avenger. He, laying at my feet his conquering sword, Withdrew. Two years elapst, he urged the dangers That still encompast me; recall'd our walks, Our studies, our reproofs for idling, smiled at By (O kind man!) the grandfather of both. I bade him hope. Hope springs up at that word And disappears; Love, radiant Love, alights. Taranto was my joy; my heart was full: Alas! how little can the full heart spare? I paus'd . . because I ill might utter it . . In time he turn'd his fancies to another. Wretchedest of the wretched was I now; But gentle tones much comforted my anguish, Until they ended; then loud throbs confused The treasured words; then heavy sleep opprest me. I was ashamed . . I am ashamed . . yet (am I Unwomanly to own it?) when he loved One only, I was driven to despair; When more . . Adieu Taranto! cried my heart And almost sank thro' sorrow into peace. O that fresh crimes in him should solace me! My life of love was over, when his spirit Flew from my lips, and carried my forgiveness On high, for Heaven's. Wars burst forth again; He who defended me from their assaults Saw in me what to love, but whom to love He found not in me. “If my confidence, My gratitude,” said I, “suffice thee, Otho, Here is my hand.” He took it, and he wept. Brave man! and let me also weep for thee! Agatha. Not beauteous youth enrobed in royal purple And bright with early hope, have moved you so. Giovanna. Record not either; let me dwell on Otho: The thoughts of him sink deeper in my pillow; His valiant heart and true one bleeds for me. SCENE II. COURT-YARD OF MURO. Maximim and Stephen. Stephen. Maximin! art thou close? Maximin. Yea, close enough, Altho' I have the whole court-yard to cool in. Stephen. I meant not that. Maximin. A baton to a pike Thou didst not; else thou hadst not spoken it. Stephen. Some folks think better of my understanding. Maximin. None of thy heart: give me thy fist then, Stephen. Stephen. That sets all right. Maximin. What brought thee hither? Stephen. What? Maximin. Hast secrets? Stephen. None worth knowing. Maximin. No man has: They never did any one good. Stephen. They may. Maximin! hast commands for Hungary? Maximin. For Hungary? Stephen. What! is there no such place? Maximin. No, by my soul! nor ever will for me. Were not my sister here about her duty, I could knock out my brains against the wall To think of Hungary. Stephen. Yet thou hast there No croft, no homestead, pullet, chick. Maximin. Hast thou? Stephen. I am a man at last. Wert thou but one! Maximin. Stephen, we will not quarrel. Stephen. I am rich I meant to say. Maximin. So far so well: however, Not some bold thief who stands some ages back (Tho' better there than nearer) nor some bolder Who twists God's word and overturns his scales, Nor steel, nor soil in any quantity, Nor gold, whose chain encompasses the globe, Nor even courage, Stephen, is sufficient To make a man: one breath on Woman's wrongs, Lifting the heart, does that. Stephen. And other things. Maximin. Chick, pullet, homestead, croft; are these our makers? Stephen. I have them in this lining, one and all. Maximin (suspecting). Stephen! I could show thee the duplicate In the same hand. He who fixt me at Muro Will fix thee too in some such place as firmly. What! hast no heart for castles? art low-minded? How! with chick, pullet, homestead, croft? Sit down: Thou didst not sweat so after all thy walk As thou dost now. What ails thee, man? Stephen. What ails me! Nothing. Maximin. But did Fra Rupert, did he truly Clap thee up here? Cleverly done! Don't blame him. Stephen. Blame him! if friar he were not, and moreover The tadpole of a bishop, by the martyr! I would run back and grapple with his weazon. Maximin. He is too cunning for us simple men. Stephen. For thee, it seems, he has been . . but for me, I, man or child, was never yet out-witted. Maximin. Ah! we all think so; yet all are, by weaker. And now about the letter. Stephen. Thee he trusted; I know he did; show me the duplicate. Maximin. Duplicates are not written first nor shown first. How many men art good against? Stephen. One only. Maximin. Then five might overmaster thee and gag thee, And five are ready in the Apennines; If I knew where exactly, I would tell thee. Stephen. A fiend of hell in frock! Maximin. No, not so bad: He, without blame or danger on thy part, Shall build thy fortune. Stephen. He? I scorn the thief . . Beside . . he would not. Maximin. Would or not, he shall. [Stephen hesitates. Am I an honest man? Stephen. Why! as men go. Maximin. Give me the letter then, and, on my life, It shall do more and better for thee much Than placed in any other hands but mine. An Officer passes. Ho! Captain! see an honest man at last, [Giving him the letter. And you the very one he came about. Stephen (threatening Maximin). Traitor! Maximin. A traitor, with a vengeance, is he. Stephen. Hangman! Maximin. Thou needst not call him; he will come Presently. [To the Officer. This poor hind hath saved the prince From insurrection, from invasion. Read. [Officer reads. The royal favour will shine warm upon One friend of mine. Officer. Be sure: he will be made. 'Tis but our service . . We must not complain . . Tho' there are things, of late, which soldiers' crops Swell high against. We captains . . Maximin. Ay, we captains! . . Officer. I must be gone to Naples; so must thou My gallant grey-coat. [Goes out. Maximin. Tell me how thou camest To Muro, of all places in the world, It lies so wide of any road to Hungary. Stephen. Fra Rupert bade me follow at mid-day A band of holy mendicants, due-south, To baffle all suspicion: the next morn To cross the mountains on my left, and turn Northward, and then take boat by Pesaro. While they were stretcht along the levelest tiles In the best chamber . . being mendicants . . Each on his sheepskin . . for they love soft lying . . Of grand farm-house; and while nighthawk and grillo Fought for it which should sing them first to sleep; And while aside them, in brass pot unfathom'd, The rich goat-whey was ripening for next breakfast, I thought of my far sheep and my near friend; My near friend first; and so, by luck, here am I. Maximin. But how didst dream that thou shouldst find me here? Stephen. Who, in the Virgin's name, should first step up, After I bade the mendicants good-bye, Who but Augustin! Much about our country, Mops, wakes, fairs, may-poles, gipsy-girls, and fortunes, When suddenly, as one that knew them all, He whisper'd thou wert art this Muro here, Some twenty miles, or near upon it, off. I must fain see thee. After three hours' walk I ask the distance: twenty-five miles scant. At night I supt and slept with an old shepherd: His dog soon crope betwixt us, so genteely, I should have never known it, but his nose Was cold against my ear, and, when I turn'd, A snag or two was at it . . without harm. Morning blew sharp upon us from the hills. “How far are we from Muro, my good man?” Said I, and dipt my olive in the salt. “Scant thirty miles.” Let never man believe In luck! I overturned the salt, alert To hurry on; yet here thou seest me, rich . . Sleeping six hours in winter, five in summer. Maximin (pondering). Augustin told thee I was here! Augustin! How should he know? One only knew beside The friar: he never would have told: she told him. [Walks about impatiently. Augustin has smooth locks and fresh complexion, And heels for dance and voice for dulcimer, Rare articles at finding secrets out: But, with thy slanting face, and arm curl'd round The inside canework of a padded chair, And leg oblique slid negligently under, If thou wouldst keep them nicely in repair Ferret no more my secrets out, Augustin! Officer (returned). Ready? my dapple grey! ready for Naples? Stephen. Not without Maximin. By his advice I call'd you in to help us: he shall have His share. Maximin. When our blythe king sniffs up the wind, And sees the clouds roll mainly from the north, And finds Giovanna's enemies advance, He may be kinder to her: so, commander, If you believe I did my duty now, Let me confirm the letter you convey. Officer. Canst thou add aught? Maximin. Much, were there much required. Officer. Come then along: we will drink gold to-morrow. SCENE III. MONASTERY GARDENS. Rupert (alone). I must have peace: I can not live without it: Only few years (who knows) may yet remain. They shall not hurt the queen: in part the harm Would be my doing. But then Maximin . . He too . . yet why not let him die in battle? Battles there will be: kings are all tenacious Of their king-life: Italians are astute, Hungarians valiant: two stout swords must clash Before one break. That Agatha, that Agatha Troubles me most of all! Suppose she comes Into my very palace at Nocera, And tells the people what the bishop did! Never was blow cruel like this since Herod. Giovanna must then live, if for her sake Alone; for such her tenderness, her truth, She'll not abandon her while life remains. SCENE IV. PALACE IN NAPLES. Durazzo. Chancellor. Privy-counsellors. Durazzo. Speak, my lord chancellor: you now have read The letter through: can doubt remain upon it? [Chancellor shakes his head. Gentlemen! you have heard it: what think you? First Counsellor. Traitorous, if there be treason. Second Counsellor. Sentence then. Chancellor. Powerful is Rupert: many think him saintly, All know him wise and wary: he has friends In every house, and most among the women. Such men are dangerous to impeach: beside, Being now bishop . . Durazzo. Not quite yet: appointed, Not seated. Chancellor. No? This changes the whole aspect. Once bearing that high dignity, once throned . . Durazzo. I like no thrones that narrow mine too much, And wonder wherefore clergymen should mount them. Chancellor. However, sir, since such hath been the custom From barbarous times . . Durazzo. Till times herein as barbarous . . Chancellor. We must observe the usage of the realm, And keep our hands from touching things held sacred. Few days ago, for lighter crimes the friar Might have been punisht with severity. First Counsellor. Even now, although his legs begin to sprout With scarlet plumage, we may crop his crest; But better on the beam than in the yard. Third Counsellor. It would put by much bickering. Fourth Counsellor. There are many Expectants, holy men, who would condemn In any court ecclesiastical Appeal so manifest to foreign force, And strip him to the skin to wash him clean. Fifth Counsellor. And there are civil laws which tread on velvet And leave no scandal when they pass the door; Modest and mild and beautifully drest, And void of all loquacity, all pomp; They, should you ask them what they are, reply “We are not laws; we are prerogatives.” Carlo. Paoluccio! wit may give the best advice. Far be from me all violence. If the criminal Be strong and boisterous, the ecclesiastical Craving and crafty, swift or slow at pleasure, At least our civil laws are excellent, And what you call prerogatives are civil. Paoluccio. I class them so. Many at once. They are the best of all. Carlo. I will pursue this counsel. You may rise. ACT V. SCENE I. CASTLE OF MURO. Giovanna. Agatha. Otho. Officers. Giovanna. What shouts are those? whose voice, above them all, Above the neighing horse and trumpet's clang, Calls to the rescue? Can I doubt? . . My Otho! My Otho! rush not rashly into fight: Thou canst not free me. Agatha. He has beat them off . . He enters. Officer. Yes, he enters. Otho (wounded mortally). Take the ransom . . 'Tis small . . 'tis only one worn life . . and loose her. Giovanna. Not from thy neck, my Otho, while thou livest, Or while I live. Otho. Giovanna hath embraced me . . I now have lived . . life should be over now. Officer. His breath is gone: bear him away: the king [Points to the Queen, who swoons. May have commands for her. Agatha. My queen! my queen! My friend! my comforter! Oh! that no more. [Falls. SCENE II. PALACE, NAPLES. Margarita. Durazzo. Margarita. I can not see what mighty things indeed My aunt Giovanna ever did for me: Can you? Durazzo. They long are over, if she did. Margarita. Beside . . Durazzo. Now what beside? Margarita. I had almost Said such a foolish thing! Durazzo. You! Margarita! Margarita. I was about to say she did no more For me than you. If she loved me, she loved me Because she loved my mother, her own sister; Where is the wonder? where the merit? Durazzo. None. Margarita. She even loved another sister, her Whom people called Fiammetta; God knows why; No Christian name, nought Christian-like about it. She was the one of Sicily, who fancied (O shame upon her!) somebody . . a writer. Durazzo. What writer? Margarita. Is not that enough? a writer! Durazzo. There is not much to thank her for, if all Partake of her affection, even those Who sink so low. Margarita. She played with you the most; Perhaps because she thought you like her child. She did show pleasure when she fondled me; But 'twas not to make me the happier, Although it did so, but herself . . herself. Yet, Carlo, would you think it! there are times When I am ready to desire of you That you would let her out of such a den At Muro. Durazzo. Had you mentioned it before, As wishing it . . why, then indeed . . Margarita. So, then, You would have let her out? How very kind! Durazzo. If we could have persuaded her to go. Margarita. Persuaded her? what! out of prison? Durazzo. Do not Term it so harshly: who can bear to hear Of prisons? Margarita. Is the tower indeed not lockt Nor bolted? Durazzo. People would run into it And trouble her devotions. At this time She needs them most particularly. Margarita. Why? Durazzo. Her health declines. Margarita. Is she in danger? Durazzo. Some. Margarita. Imminent? Durazzo. There are fears. Margarita. About her life? Durazzo. Men shake their heads. Margarita. O Carlo! O my Carlo! I have . . (will God forgive me?) been ungrateful. And all this time! . . when, but one moment of it . . My hand in hers, or hers upon my head . . Durazzo. Hush! Margarita! thou'rt a queen: be calm, And worthy of the station we enjoy. [He leads her out. SCENE III. PALACE, NAPLES. High Steward. Chamberlain. Chancellor. Durazzo. Chamberlain. Wary and slow is this our chancellor, Where title-deeds are fluttering in suspense; The perill'd life and honour of his queen He passes as he would a wretch in chains On the road-side, saying, So! there thou art! Lord High Steward. We want such men's religion, their sound sense, Coolness, deliberation, ponderous front, Broad and dark eyebrow. Much of dignity, Reverence and awe, build on these crags alone. Lord Chamberlain. Ye have them all in one. I hear his foot: The king steps lighter: both advance. Lord High Steward. Who come Behind? for there are many. (Durazzo, Chancellor, Counsellors, enter.) Durazzo. Take your seats. Gentlemen! ye have heard with indignation The rash attempt against my peace and yours, Made by the Suabian, husband of Giovanna. Lord Chamberlain. We hear, by Heaven's protection of your Highness, It fail'd. Lord High Steward. And that he fell in the attempt. Durazzo. Desperate, he cut his way, tho' wounded, thro' My bravest troops, but could not force the gate; Horsemen are weak at walls nine fathoms high; He had scarce twenty with him. Chancellor. There he paid His forfeit life, declared already traitor. Durazzo. On this we are not met, but to deliberate On the state's safety. My lord chancellor, Is the queen guilty? Chancellor (starts). We must try her first, Privately; then decide. Durazzo. Yea, privately; So pleaseth me. Take then your secretaries And question her; decorously, humanely. SCENE IV. CASTLE OF MURO. Giovanna. Chancellor. High Steward. Chamberlain. Secretaries. Chancellor. Lady! we have heard all, and only ask (For the realm's weal) your Highness will vouchsafe To sign this parchment. Giovanna (Taking it). What contains it? Chancellor. Peace. Giovanna. I then would sign it with my blood; but blood Running from royal veins never sign'd peace. [Reads. It seems I am required to abdicate In favour of Duke Carlo of Durazzo. Chancellor. Even so. Giovanna (to the others). To you I turn me, gentlemen! If ever you are told that I admitted His unjust claims, if ever you behold Sign'd, as you fancy, by my hand the parchment That waives our kingdom from its rightful heir, Believe it not: only believe these tears, Of which no false one ever fell from me Among the many 'twas my fate to shed. I want not yours; they come too late, my friends; Farewell, then! You may live and serve your country; These walls are mine, and nothing now beyond. SCENE V. NAPLES. Maximin. Stephen. Maximin. Among the idle and the fortunate Never drops one but catafalc and canopy Are ready for him: organ raves above, And songsters wring their hands and push dull rhymes Into dull ears that worse than wax hath stopt, And cherubs puff their cheeks and cry half-split With striding so across his monument. Name me one honest man for whom such plays Were ever acted. They will ne'er lay Otho With kindred clay! no helm, no boot beside His hurried bier! no stamp of stately soldier Angry with grief and swearing hot revenge, Until even the paid priest turns round and winks. I will away: sick, weary . . (Stephen enters.) Stephen. Hast thou heard The saddest thing? Maximin. Heard it? . . committed it, Say rather. But for thee and thy curst gold, Which, like magician's, turns to dust, I trow, I had received him in the gate, and brought The treasure of his soul before his eyes: He had not closed them so. Stephen. Worst of it all Is the queen's death. Maximin. The queen's? Stephen. They stifled her With her own pillow. Maximin. Who says that? Stephen. The man Runs wild who did it, through the streets, and howls it, Then imitates her voice, and softly sobs “Lay me in Santa Chiara.” SCENE VI. NAPLES. BEFORE THE PALACE. AMONG GUARDS. Maximin. Durazzo. Maximin. Gallant prince! Conqueror of more than men, of more than heroes! What may that soldier merit who deserts His post, and lets the enemy to the tent? Durazzo. Death is the sentence. Maximin. Sign that sentence then. I shall be found beside a new-made grave In Santa Chiara. Durazzo. Art thou mad? Maximin. I shall be If you delay. Durazzo (to Guards). See this man into Hungary. SCENE VII. NAPLES. MONASTERY GARDEN. Rupert (alone). There are some pleasures serious men sigh over, And there are others maniacs hug in chains: I wonder what they are: I would exchange All mine for either, all that e'er were mine. I have been sadly treated my whole life, Cruelly slighted, shamefully maligned: And this too will be laid upon my shoulders. If men are witty, all the wit of others Bespangles them; if criminal, all crimes Are shoveled to their doors. God knows how truly I wisht her life; not her imprisonment More truly. Maximin and Agatha In the queen's life would never have come forth. Men of late years have handled me so roughly, I am become less gentle than I was. Derision, scoffs and scorns, must be rebuft, Or we can do no good in act or counsel. Respect is needful, is our air, our day, 'Tis in the sight of men we see ourselves, Without it we are dark and halt and speechless. Religion in respect and power hath being, And perishes without them. Power I hold: Why shun men's looks? why my own thoughts . . afraid? No, I am not afraid: but phantasies Long dwelt on let us thro'. If I do quail, 'Tis not the mind, the spirit; 'tis the body. A Monk (entering). Father I come from Muro, where a woman (Sickly before) for days refused all food, And now is dead. Rupert. What is her name? Monk. One Agatha. Rupert. Did she receive the holy Sacrament? Monk. You must have known she did, else why such joy? She would receive nought else. Rupert. Then she is safe. Monk. We trust in God she is: yet she herself Had pious doubt. Rupert. Of what was her discourse? Monk. Her mind, ere she departed, wandered from her. Rupert. What did she talk about? dost hear? Monk. She said, “Rupert, if he could see me, might be” . . . Rupert. What? Monk. Her mind, observe, was wandering. Rupert. Thine is too. Tell me the very word she uttered. Monk. “Saved.” Blessings upon her! your uplifted hands And radiant brow announce her present bliss. Rupert. Said she no more? Monk. “Since he's not here, take these, And let the friar and his brotherhood Say masses for my soul: it may do good To theirs no less.” I stoopt the holy taper, And through her fingers and her palm could see That she held something: she had given it But it dropt out of them: this crucifix, From which the square-set jewels were removed, And this broad golden piece, with its long chain Of soft dark hair, like our late queen Giovanna's. Rupert. Her medal . . anno primo . . All goes right. Monk. Your blessing! Rupert. Take it, pr'ythee, and begone. [Monk goes. Nothing has hurt me: none have seen me. None? Ye saints of heaven! hath ever prayer been miss'd? Penance, tho' hard, been ever unperform'd? Why do ye then abandon me? like one Whom in your wrath ye hurl aside; like one Scathed by those lightnings which God's sleepless eye Smites earth with, and which devils underneath, Feeling it in the abysses of the abyss, Rejoice was not for them. Repent I did . . Even of Agatha I did repent. I did repent the noble friends had fallen. Could they not have been wiser, and escaped, By curbing evil passions, pride, distrust, Defiance? It was wrong in them: in me 'Twas not quite well: 'twas harsh, 'twas merciless: Andrea had not done it: wrong'd, betray'd, Andrea had not done it. Have my words Sorcery in them? do they wake the dead? Hide thy pale face, dear boy! hide from my sight Those two dark drops that stain thy scanty beard, Hide those two eyes that start so! Curse me, kill me; 'Twere mercy, 'twere compassion, not revenge; Justice, the echo of God's voice, cries More! I can endure all else. I will arise, Push off this rack that rends me, rush before him And ask him why he made me what I am. (Enter Officers.) First Officer. Traitor! the king hath traced all thy devices. Rupert. Without them he had ne'er been what ye style him. Second Officer. Avowest thou thy perfidy? Rupert. And his. Third Officer. Murderer! thou shalt confess. Rupert. 'Twere royal bounty. Third Officer. And die. Rupert. 'Twere more than royal. First Officer. Come thy way. Rupert. My way? my way? . . I've travell'd it enough, With or without thee I will take another. Second Officer. Whither! Rupert (points to the window). Look yonder! There it lies. [Stabs himself. Andrea! First Officer (after a pause). Merciful God! end thus his many crimes? Third Officer (after a pause). What moans and piteous wailings from the street! Second Officer. Can they arise for him so suddenly? First Officer. There are too many. None hath told the deed Beyond this spot, none seen it. Third Officer. Now you hear Distinctly; if distinctly may be heard The wail of thousands. Second Officer. Their queen's name they cry . . Third Officer. With blessings. First Officer. Now, at last, ye know Giovanna; And now will Rupert too be known, tho' late. THE SIEGE OF ANCONA. No event in the history of Italy, including the Roman, is at once so tragical and so glorious as the siege of Ancona; nor shall we find at any period of it, two contemporary characters so admirable for disinterested valour and prompt humanity, as William degli Adelardi of Marchesella, and the Countess of Bertinoro. The names of those who sustained the siege are, for the most part, forgotten: but Muratori has inserted in his imperishable work the narratives of contemporary and nearly contemporary authors; and Sismondi has rendered many of the facts more generally known. —Hist. des Répub. Ital., tome xi. ch. i. MALE CHARACTERS. The Consul of Ancona. The Archbishop of Mentz. The Bishop of Ancona. Antonio Stamura. Father John. Minuzzi. Costanzio. Corrado, brother of Costanzio. Paolucci, formerly Consul. Marchesella. Herald, Senators, Officers, Priests, People.FEMALE CHARACTERS. Erminia, the Consul's daughter. Nina, her companion. Angelica, mother of Antonio Stamura. Malaspina. Countess of Bertinoro. Marca, attendant on Erminia. ACT I. SCENE I. On the steps of the cathedral, commanding a view of the country. Many of all ages are leaving the church and looking at the approach of the Archbishop, just beyond the walls, descending the hill. Erminia. Nina! see what our matin prayers have brought us. O what a sight! The youth and maidens fly, Some to the city, others up the hills, With the fresh tale each for the one loved best. Nina. They are afraid to meet so many horses; I would not scud away so, were I there, Would you? Erminia. My dress would show the dust; or else . . I run to tell my father: go, tell yours. SCENE II. CONSUL'S HOUSE. Consul and Erminia. Erminia. Father! why are not all the bells set ringing? Consul. What should the bells be ringing for to-day? Erminia. Such a procession comes along the road As never was: some bishop at the head: And what a horse is under him! and what Beautiful boys . . they really are but boys, Dear father . . hold the bridle on each side! Scarlet and gold about their surplices, And waving hair; not like church servitors, But princes' sons. I would give all the world To see their faces . . not quite all the world . . For who would care about boys' faces, father? Beside, they are too distant, very far. Consul. Art thou gone wild, Erminia? Erminia. Come and see. Consul (listening, and rising). What means this tumult? Senators enter. Consul! we are lost. Consul. How so? First Senator. The archbishop comes, from Barbarossa, Against the city. Consul. What archbishop comes? Second Senator. Of Mentz. Consul. Then close the gates, and man the walls, And hurl defiance on him. Bring my robe, Erminia! I will question this proud prelate. Gasparo, lift my armour from the wall In readiness. Officer. A herald, sir, claims entrance. Herald enters. Consul. What would your master with his perfidy? Herald. My master is the emperor and king. Consul. The more perfidious. Binds him not his oath To succour Italy? Is slavery succour? Tell the false priest thou comest from, that priest Who took the name of Christian at the font, 'Twere well he held not in such mockery The blessed one he bears it from. But wealth And power put Wisdom's eyes out, lest she rule. Herald. Sir Consul! if the archbishop never preaches, Pray why should you? It ill becomes my office To bandy words: mine is but to repeat The words of others: and their words are these: “The people of Ancona must resign Their lawless independence, and submit To Frederick, our emperor and king.” Consul. Brief is the speech; and brief is the reply. The people of Ancona will maintain Their lawful independence, and submit No tittle, sir, to emperor or king. Herald. Is this the final answer? Consul. Lead him forth. Officer (enters). Sir! ere you hasten to the walls, look once Toward the harbour. Consul. Gracious Heaven! what sails Are those? Venetian? Officer. Yes; and they take soundings. Consul. Venice against us? Freedom's first-born child, After the deluge that drowned Italy. Alas! the free are free but for themselves; They hate all others for it. The first murderer (Their patron) slew his brother. Thus would they. [To the Officer. Merluccio! hasten, man! call back again Our mariners to leave the battlements And guard their sisters and their mothers here. Officer. Mothers and sisters follow'd them, to bring Munition up the towers. Consul. Bid them return: The beach is open: thither is my road Until more hands arrive. Messenger (enters). Sir! they weigh down Machines for storming. Consul. Go thou, tell Campiglio To intercept them, if he can, before They join the Germans on the hills above. Erminia. O father! here are none beside ourselves: And those few people hauling in the boats Can help us little; they are so afraid. Consul. Think not they are afraid because they pull The oars with desperate strength and dissonance: Who knows if they have each his loaf at home, Or smallest fish set by from yesterday? The weather has been rough; there is a swell From the Adriatic. Leave me now, Erminia! Erminia. Alone, dear father? Consul (placing his hand on the head of Erminia). He who watches over The people, never is alone, my child! Erminia (running back). Here come the men who were debarking. Minuzzi and others. Minuzzi. Hail, Sir Consul! All our fears then were but vain? Consul. So! you did fear? Minuzzi. Ay did we. The Venetians Ride in huge galleys; we ply boats for trade. But since, Sir Consul, you expected them, We are all safe. I did not much misgive When one in gallant trim, a comely youth, Outside the mole, but ready to slip in, Beckon'd me from his boat, and gave me, smiling, This letter, bidding me deliver it Into no other hand beside the consul's, And adding, “All will soon be well again.” I hope it may. But there was cause for doubt! The galleys have cast anchor. Consul. Sure enough They join our enemies. Minuzzi. How! One free state Against another! Slaves fight slaves, and kings Fight kings: so let them, till the last has bled: But shall wise men (and wise above the wise, And free above the free are the Venetians) Devastate our joint patrimony . . freedom? I fear not him who falls from such a highth Before he strikes me. At him! my brave boys! At him! the recreant! We have borne too much In seeing his attempt. Could not we cut The cables? Stamura. Rare, rare sport for us! Consul. Stamura! If wise Minuzzi deems it feasible, Ye shall enjoy the pastime, while the wind Sits in this quarter, blowing from due-east Hard into port: else must ye to the walls, To meet full twenty thousand, well approved In arms the most-part, all athirst for plunder. Minuzzi. Where are they posted? Consul. At the battlements. Minuzzi. Lads! we must lose no time. Sailor. Now let us see Whether we too may not be mischievous As they could wish us, this fine April morn. Minuzzi. Each bring his hatchet. Off! and quickly back. [They go. Father John enters. One word, Sir Consul, ere we part, this one: My wife sits nigh the old church porch, infirm With many watchings; thro' much love for me, True-hearted! should the waters wash me home, Stiffen'd a little more than is convenient, Let none displace her from that low stone seat. Grant me my suit, unless I fail in duty. Consul (presses his hand). And these are breasts despotic power would crush! [Minuzzi going, meets Father John, who had listened. Father John. Talk ye of hatchets? Consul. Father John! good day! F. John. Yea, with God's blessing, we will make it so. Consul. I want your counsel on a perilous move. Father! you were a diver in time past. F. John. And in time present may be one again. Minuzzi. Ah! could you join us in our enterprise! F. John. What is it? Minuzzi. Why, to dive and cut the cables Of yon Venetians dancing there so gaily, And bowing in bright pennons to each other. F. John. Is this the Doge's wedding-day with Adria? No dame in Venice ever played him falser Than she will do, and haply before night. Ye spoke of hatchet! 'Twould but do poor work Against a cable. Stamura. We can hold our breath A good while on such business. Consul. Father John, Could you devise some fitter instrument? Minuzzi. Ah! what inventions have not priests devised! We all of us are what we are thro' them. F. John. I love this reverence, my grey boy! and aptly Hast thou believed that Father John could frame What will perform the work, else difficult. I thought of Turks and Saracens, and flags Bearing the crescent, not the winged lion, When I prepared my double-handed sickle To reap the hemp-field that lies under water. I will dive too, and teach you on the way How ye shall manage it. So fare you well, Sir Consul! [To the Man. We have all the day before us And not long work (tho' rather hard) to do. SCENE III. Consul and Erminia. Consul. Erminia! read this letter. Wait awhile . . Repress thy curiosity . . First tell me, Erminia! would'st thou form some great alliance? Erminia. Yes, father! who would not? Consul. I know that none Hath won that little heart of thine at present. Erminia. Many, many have won it, my dear father! I never see one run across the street To help a lame man up or guide a blind man But that one wins it: never hear one speak As all should speak of you, but up my arms Fly ready to embrace him! Consul. And when any Says thou art beautiful, and says he loves thee, What are they ready then for? Erminia. Not to beat him Certainly: but none ever said such things. They look at me because I am your daughter, And I am glad they look at me for that, And always smile, tho' some look very grave. Consul. Well now, Erminia, should his Holiness The Pope have sent his nephew with this letter, Would you receive him willingly? Erminia. Most willingly. Consul. Nay, that is scarcely maidenly, so soon. Erminia. I would not if you disapprove of it. Consul. I do suspect he came aboard the galleys. Erminia. O then, the galleys are not enemies. Consul. Not if thou givest him thy hand. What say'st thou? Erminia. I never saw him. Consul. But suppose him handsome. Indeed I hear much of his comeliness. Erminia. Is that enough? Consul. And virtues. Erminia. That alone Is not enough, tho' very, very much. He must be handsome too, he must be brave, He must have seen me often, and must love me, Before I love or think of him as lover: For, father, you are not a king, you know, Nor I a princess: so that all these qualities (Unless you will it otherwise) are necessary. Consul. Thou art grown thoughtful suddenly, and prudent. Erminia. Do not such things require both thought and prudence? Consul. In most they come but slowly; and this ground Is that where we most stumble on. The wise Espouse the foolish; and the fool bears off From the top branch the guerdon of the wise: Ay, the clear-sighted (in all other things) Cast down their eyes and follow their own will, Taking the hand of idiots. They well know They shall repent, but find the road so pleasant That leads into repentance. Erminia. Ah, poor souls! They must have lost their fathers: then what wonder That they have lost their way! Consul. Now, in few words, Erminia, for time presses, let me tell thee, The Pope will succour us against our foe If I accept his nephew for a son. Erminia. O father! does that make our cause more righteous? Or more unrighteous theirs who persecute us? Consul. No, child: but wilt thou hear him? Rank and riches Will then be thine. Altho' not born a princess, Thou wilt become one. Erminia. I am more already; I am your daughter; yours, whom not one voice Raised over all, but thousands. Consul. I resign My station in few days. Erminia. O stay in it Until the enemy is beaten back, That I may talk of it when I am old, And, when I weep to think of you, may dry My tears, and say, My father then was Consul. Consul. The power may be prolonged until my death. Erminia. O no: the laws forbid it: do they not? Consul. He who can make and unmake every law, Divine and human, will uphold my state So long, acknowledging his power supreme; And laying the city's keys before his feet. Erminia. Hath he not Peter's? What can he want more? O father! think again! I am a child Almost, and have not yet had time enough Quite to unlearn the lessons you enforced By precept and example. Bear with me! I have made you unhappy many times, You never made me so until this hour: Bear with me, O my father! Consul. To my arms, Erminia! Thou hast read within my breast Thy lesson backward, not suspecting guile. Yes, I was guileful. I would try thy nature: I find it what is rarely found in woman, In man as rarely. The Venetian fleet Would side with us; their towers, their catapults Would all be ours, and the Pope's nephew thine, Would but thy father place the power supreme Within his hands, becoming his vicegerent. I turn aside from fraud, and see how force May best be met, in parley with the German. SCENE IV. THE ENCAMPMENT AND TENT OF THE ARCHBISHOP UNDER THE WALLS. Consul and Archbishop. Archbishop. I do presume from your habiliments You are the consul of this petty state. Consul. I am. Archbishop. You may be seated. Once again . . Will you surrender unconditionally? Consul. Nor unconditionally nor conditionally. Archbishop. I sent for you to point where lies your duty. Consul. It lies where I have left it, in the town. Archbishop. You doubt my clemency. Consul. Say rather ‘honour.’ Archbishop. Doubt you a soldier's honour? Consul. Not a soldier's. But when the soldier and the priest unite, Well may I doubt it. Goats are harmless brutes; Dragons may be avoided; but when goat And dragon form one creature, we abhor The flames and coilings of the fell chimæra. Archbishop. And therefore you refused a conference Unless I pitch my tent beneath your walls, Within an arrow's shot, distributing Ten archers on each side; ten mine, ten yours? Consul. No doctor of divinity in Paris Is cleverer at divining. Thus it stands. Archbishop. Ill brook I such affronts. Consul. Ill brook, perhaps, Florence and Pisa their ambassadors Invited to a conference on peace, And cast in prison. Archbishop. Thus we teach the proud Their duty. Consul. Let the lame man teach the lame To walk, the blind man teach the blind to see. Archbishop. Insolent! Unbecoming of my station Were it to argue with a churl so rude. Rise: look before you thro' the tent: what see you? Consul. I see huge masses of green corn upheaved Within a belt of palisades. Archbishop. What else? Consul. Sheep, oxen, horses, trampling them. Archbishop. No more? Consul. Other huge masses farther off are smoking, Because their juices quench the faggot-fire. Archbishop. And whence come these? Consul. From yonder houseless fields, Of crops, and even of boundaries, bereft. Archbishop. Whose were they? Consul. Whose? The church's, past a doubt: It never takes what is not freely given. Archbishop. Proud rebels! you have brought upon your heads This signal vengeance from offended Cæsar. Consul. And must ten thousand starve because one man Is wounded in that part which better men Cut from them, as ill-sorted with our nature? If Satan could have dropt it, he were saved. Archbishop. What meanest thou? What cast they from them? Consul. Pride. It clings round little breasts and masters them, It drops from loftier, spurn'd and trodden down. Is this, my lord archbishop, this your Eden? Is this the sacrifice of grateful herbs Ye offer to your Gods? And will the next Be more acceptable? Burnt-offerings raised In your high places, and fossed round with blood! Archbishop. Blasphemer! I am here no priest; I come Avenger of insulted majesty. But, if thou mindest Holy Writ, mind this, The plainest thing, and worthiest of remembrance: . . Render to Cæsar what is Cæsar's, man! Consul. God will do that for us. Nought owe we Cæsar But what he sent us when he sent you hither, To cut our rising wheat, our bleeding vines, To burn our olives for your wild carousals . . Archbishop. The only wood that will burn green: it blazes Most beautifully, and no smell from it. But you Anconites have poor olive grounds, We shall want more by Sunday. Consul. May the curse Of God be on you! Archbishop. We are not so impious: It is on you: it were a sin to wish it. Consul. Prince and archbishop! there are woes that fall Far short of curses, though sore chastisements; Prosperities there are that hit the mark, And the clear-sighted see God's anger there. Archbishop. Are we constrain'd to drag and vex the sea And harrow up the barren rocks below For noisome weeds? Are household animals Struck off the knee to furnish our repast? Consul. Better endure than cause men this endurance. Archbishop. Clearly ye think so: we think otherwise. 'Tis better to chastise than be chastised, To be the judge than be the criminal. Consul. How oft, when crimes are high enough to strike The front of Heaven, are those two characters Blended in one! Archbishop. I am not to be school'd By insolence and audacity. Consul. We are, It seems: but fortitude and trust in God Will triumph yet. Our conference is closed. ACT II. SCENE I. AT THE RAMPARTS. Angelica, Stamura, and Soldiers. Angelica. See ye those towers that stride against the walls? Soldier. See you this arrow? Few were not more fatal That flew from them: but this arrests my arm Perhaps beyond to-morrow. Angelica (to others). Fight amain. Soldier. The widow of Stamura is below, And, slender tho' her figure, fair her face, Brave as her husband. Few her words: beware Of falling back, lest they increase and shame us. Another Soldier. Long live Stamura! She hath crost already The sallyport. Another Soldier. What held she in her hand? Another Soldier. A distaff. Soldier. Hush! what cries are those? Another Soldier. All German. Soldier. What dust is overhead? Another Soldier. Is not it smoke? Hurrah! flames mount above the battlements. Soldier. It was her deed. Another Soldier. But whose those cries behind us, Along the harbour? Soldier. Those all are Italian. Another Soldier. Look! How yon tower curls outward, red and reeling! Soldier. Ay; it leans forward as in mortal pain. Another Soldier. What are those things that drop? Soldier. Men, while we speak, Another moment, nothing. Another Soldier. Some leap down; Others would keep their desperate grasp: the fire Loosens it; and they fall like shrivell'd grapes Which none will gather. See it, while you can; It totters, parts, sinks. What a crash! The sparks Will blind our archers. Another Soldier. What a storm of fire! SCENE II. THE CONSUL'S HOUSE. Consul, Erminia. Erminia. The men you spoke with in the port have pass'd The window, and seem entering. Consul. Friends, come in. Minuzzi (entering with Stamura and others). Sir Consul! we are here inopportunely, Our work is done: God prosper'd it. Young lady! We come no feasters at a consul's board. Consul. Erminia! coverest thou our scanty fare Because 'tis scanty, and not over-nice? Child! thou hast eaten nothing. Erminia. Quite enough. Consul. No wonder thou hast lost thy appetite, And sighest. Erminia. I am sure I did not sigh; Nor have I lost my appetite. Consul. Then eat: Take off the napkin. Erminia. Father! you well know What is beneath it. Consul. Half a cake. Erminia. Of beans, Of rye, of barley, swept from off the manger: My little horse had eaten them ere now, But . . Consul. The child weeps. Even such flesh must serve. Heaven grant us even this a few days hence. Erminia (to Stamura). Signor Antonio! do not look at me, I pray you, thinking of my greediness; Eat, eat! I kept it . . If the sea's fresh air Makes hungry those who sail upon it, surely It must . . after such toil . . Stamura. Such toil 'twas not. Erminia. Father! could you persuade him? Stamura. Pray excuse me! I want no food. Consul. Take what there is, and wine, Wine we have still in plenty, old and strong. Stamura. Grant me this one half-beaker. Erminia. Let me run And rinse it well. Stamura. Forbear! forbear! Consul. We have No man or maiden in the house; they all Fight or assist the fighting. Erminia. He has taken And drank it every drop! Poor, poor Antonio! O how he must have thirsted! [To Stamura. 'Twas half water. Stamura. It was not very strong. Minuzzi. And yet the colour Mounts to his eyes as 'twere sheer wine of Crete. Consul. I am impatient (you must pardon me) To hear what you have done. Pour out the wine, Erminia! that can cause but short delay. [They drink, all but Stamura. Cries in the street, “Long live Stamura!” Stamura. Call they me? why me? [Cries again. “Long live the brave Angelica.” Stamura. My mother! Minuzzi. Now for the wine! The boy will faint. Angelica. Help! father! Officer. Sir! saw you not the flames along the sky? Has no one told you how that noble lady Burnt down the tower with all its galleries, Down to the very wheels? Stamura. Who minds the tower? Sir! is she safe? unhurt? Officer. Sir! the ram's head, Blacken'd with smoke, lean'd prone against the wall, Then seem'd to shudder as 'twere half-alive. Then fell the iron mass. It made no sound Among the ashes. Had it made a loud one There were much louder from the wretches crusht Beneath it and its tower; some tearing off Their burning armour agonised with pain, And others pierced with red-hot nails that held The rafters; others holding up their arms Against the pitch and sulphur that pour'd down. It was a sight! Well might it have detain'd, Those who beheld it, from their duty here. Up flew, not sparks alone, but splinters huge, Crackling against the battlements, and drove More men away than all their arrows could. Stamura. Sir Consul! I must warm myself with fighting After this dip. [Aside. Nor see my mother first? She would be first to blame me if I did. [Goes. Consul. God prosper thee, brave youth, God prosper thee! Erminia (aside). Discourteous man! he said no word to me! He even forgot my father. Father John enters. Minuzzi. Here comes one Who can relate to you the whole exploit Better than we. Father John. Where is Antonio? Minuzzi. Gone This instant. How was it ye did not meet? Father John. Ha! I am this time caught in my own net. I knew the knave would run away at seeing me; He told me if I came he would be gone, Fearing to hear my story. So, sir Consul, I stole in softly through the stable-door. I can not keep my breath beneath the surface So long as boys can. They are slenderer, Less buoyant too, mayhap. Oft as I rose My pilot-fish was with me; that Stamura Would never leave me. Erminia. Father John! your blessing. You always used to give it me. Father John. There, take it. How the girl kisses my rough hand to-day! [Aside. Forgetful, heedless, reckless of himself He held a shapeless shield of cork before me, Wherefrom a silent shower of arrows fell From every galley, amid shouts like hunters' As they caught sight of us. The bright steel points Rebounding (for not one of them bit through) Glistened a moment as they clove the water, Then delved into the uneven furrow'd sands. Surely the lustrous and unclosing eyes Of well-poised fishes have enjoy'd to-day A rarity; they never saw before So many feathers sticking all upright Under the brine so many fathoms deep. Consul. Father! your gaiety will never fail you. Father John. Not while it pleases God to use my arm Or wits, such as they are, to serve my country. But this I tell you: had the boy been less Assiduous, or less brave, the fish had seen Another sight they oftener see, and then No Father John had blest that maiden more. Minuzzi. Stamura saved our country, saving you. Father John. And you too, both of you, did well your duty. Minuzzi. A ground are five good galleys, and their crews Await your mercy. Father John. Did Stamura bring His captive, that spruce Roman-spoken gallant? Consul. He brought none hither. Minuzzi. Now our tale is told, A little fighting will assuage the toil And cold of diving. Brave Stamura toss'd The net above his forehead fifty times And drew it off and shoved it back again, Impatient for his mother. He will knead (I trow) a pasty German ere he see her; We too may lend a hand. Come, Father John! Shrive as if we should need it. Consul. Fare ye well. Thank God! I am not rich; but this one day, My friends, I would be richer, to reward you. The ships are yours: let none else claim one plank. SCENE III. THE QUAY. People. Stamura. Stamura. Stand off! The stores within the barks belong Alike and equally to all. Much grain Will there be spilt unless a steady hand Conveys it, and divides it house by house. Horses no fewer than three score are dragged Within the gates, from the last charge against us: What would ye? Wait another charge, and take it. People. Brave, brave Antonio! SCENE IV. ARCHBISHOP'S TENT. Archbishop. The Brothers Costanzio and Corrado. Archbishop. Could ye not wait for death within the walls, But must rush out to meet it? Costanzio. We could wait As others do. Corrado. And fight we could as others. Archbishop. Costanzio and Corrado! I am grieved That you should war against your lawful prince, Your father being most loyal. Costanzio. So are we. Archbishop. What! when he serves the emperor and king, And you the rabble? Corrado. Who made men the rabble? Archbishop. Will not your treason and your death afflict him? Costanzio. Our treason would: God grant our death may not. Corrado. We never took the oaths that he has taken, And owe no duty but to our own land. Archbishop. Are ye Anconites? Corrado. No, sir, but Italians, And in Ancona lies the cause of Italy. Archbishop. Pernicious dreams! These drive young men astray; But when they once take their own cause, instead Of ours who could direct them, they are lost: So will ye find it. As ye were not born In this vile city, what, pray, could have urged you To throw your fortunes into it when sinking? Costanzio. Because we saw it sinking. Corrado. While it prosper'd It needed no such feeble aid as ours. Marquises, princes, kings, popes, emperors, Courted it then: and you, my lord archbishop, Would have it even in its last decay. Archbishop. There is a spirit in the land, a spirit So pestilential that the fire of heaven Alone can purify it. Costanzio. Things being so, Let us return and die with those we fought for. Archbishop. Captious young man! Ye die the death of traitors. Corrado. Alas! how many better men have died That death! alas, how many must hereafter! Archbishop. By following your example. Think of that; Be that your torture. Costanzio. As we never grieved At following our betters, grant, just Heaven! That neither may our betters ever grieve At following us, be the time soon or late. [To the Guards. Archbishop. Lead off these youths. Separate them. Corrado. My lord! We are too weak (you see it) for resistance; Let us then, we beseech you, be together In what is left of life! Archbishop. One hour is left: Hope not beyond. Corrado. We did hope more; we hoped To be together, tho' but half the time. Archbishop. It shall not be. Costanzio. It shall be. Archbishop. Art thou mad? I would not smile, but such pride forces me. Costanzio. God, in whose holiest cause we took up arms, Will reconcile us. Doubt it not, Corrado, Altho' such men as that man there have said it. SCENE V. CONSUL'S HOUSE. Stamura. Erminia. Stamura. Lady! you need not turn your face from me. I leave the town for aid. But one perhaps May bring it, if you listen to him. Erminia. Who? Stamura. I made a captive. Erminia. So I hear. Stamura. I come Seeking the consul: he expected me. Erminia. And him? Stamura. Him also. Erminia. Know you what he asks? Stamura. I know it. Erminia. And you wish it? you, Stamura? Stamura. I have no voice in it. Erminia. True. Go. I know it. Stamura goes. Shameless! to ask him! Never did we meet But, if his eye caught mine, he walk'd aside: Yet, by some strange occurrence, we meet daily. The Consul enters. Consul. Erminia! didst thou send away Stamura? Erminia. He went away: no need for me to send him. Consul. Knowest thou whom he made his captive? Erminia. Yes: That insolent young Roman. Consul. Speak not thus Before thou seest him. Erminia. I will never see him. Consul. Nay, I have promised scarce five minutes since That thou shalt hear him. Erminia. Has he then found favour With you so suddenly? Consul. Stamura speaks Much in his favour. Erminia. Are they friends already? Consul. Hardly; we must suppose. But here they come. Stamura. Clovio. Consul. Erminia. Clovio. Sir Consul! I am Clovio Fizzarelli. Have you received the letter? Consul. I received it. Clovio. On bended knee permit me to salute The lady who shall rule my destiny, Your fair Erminia. Erminia. You are the Pope's nephew, Sir Clovio! I have heard; and you come hither Most strongly recommended. Clovio. True, sweet lady! But I do trust, with all humility, There may be a mere trifle in myself, Not to engage you in the first half-hour, But so to plead for me, that in a day Or two, or three at farthest . . Erminia. Sir, your pleader Stands there; you are his captive, and not mine. Clovio. He knows me well. He threw my whole boat's crew (Four of them) overboard, but found his match In me. Erminia. It seems so: does it not, Antonio? Stamura. More; how much more! Clovio. There! He could not deny it. Erminia. And now he has persuaded my kind father To grant you audience. Clovio (to Stamura). She is proud: I'll tame her. Stamura (angrily). Sir! [Aside. No: he is my prisoner and my guest. Erminia. This gentleman, who is so confidential With you, and whom you whisper to for counsel, May give my hand away . . and will most gladly, I doubt not . . for my father can refuse Nothing to one who made so great a prize, Beside the preservation of the city. Clovio. Speak then, my worthy friend, if thus the consul Honours your valour; speak for me; and let me Who owe my life, owe more than life to you. Stamura. The consul knows what suits his honour best, And the young lady seems not ill disposed To shower his favour on such high desert. I have my duties; but this is not one. Let the young lady give her hand herself. If I had any wish . . but I have none . . It should be, Sir, that you had won it first By a brave action or a well-tried love. But, what is love? My road lies towards the walls. [To the Consul. With your permission, Sir! I have yours, lady! [Stamura goes. Erminia. Father! I am unwell. This gentleman Comes unexpectedly, demands abruptly . . Clovio. Impatiently, but not abruptly. Erminia. Sir! I will not marry: never, never, never. [Erminia goes. Clovio. Ha! ha! all women are alike, Sir Cousul. Leave her to me. Consul. Sir Clovio Fizzarelli! I will do more than what you ask of me. I grant you freedom. Go aboard the pinnace Which bore you into port; and say at Rome That you have seen men starving in the streets, Because his Holiness refused us help Unless a father gave a daughter up; And say the daughter would not sell her heart, Much less her country; and then add, Sir Clovio, (O were it true!) “All women are alike.” ACT III. SCENE I. EPISCOPAL PALACE. Bishop of Ancona and Father John. Bishop. I have been standing at my terrace-wall And counting those who pass and cry with hunger. Brother! the stoutest men are grown effeminate; Nay, worse; they stamp and swear, even in my presence, And looking up at me. Father John. Sad times indeed! Bishop. I calculate that giving each an ounce Only one day, scarce would a sack remain In my whole garner; I am so reduced. Father John. I come to beg your lordship for one ounce Of your fine flour, to save a child; to save A mother, who loathes ordinary food . . Not ordinary, but most bitter lupin: She has no other in the house. Bishop. No other? Poor soul! This famine is a dreadful thing! Pestilence always follows it! God help us! I tremble; I start up in sleep. Father John. My lord! An ounce of meal, a single ounce, might calm These tremblings, well applied. The nurse that should be Can be no nurse: the mother very soon Will be no mother, and the child no child. Bishop. You know not how things stand, good brother John! This very morning, as I hope for grace, I paid three golden pieces for the head, Think you, of what? an ass! Father John (aside). The cannibal! [To the Bishop.] Ah, my good lord! they bear high prices now. Bishop. Why, brother! you yourself are grown much thinner. How can you do your duty? Father John. Were I not Much thinner, I should think I had not done it. Bishop. My cook assures me that with wine and spice Elicampane, cumin, angelica, Garlic, and sundry savoury herbs, stored by Most providentially, the Lord be praised! He can make that strange head quite tolerable . . The creature was a young one . . what think you? Father John. They are more tolerable than the old. Bishop. The sellers take advantage of bad times, Quite without conscience, shame, respect for persons, Or fear of God. What can such men expect? You must have seen sad sights about our city: I wonder you are what you are. Father John. Sad sights Indeed! Bishop. But all will give their confessor Part of their pittance; and the nearer death The readier; knowing what the church can do. Tell me now, for my entrails yearn to hear it, Do they not take due care of you? Father John. No meals Have now their stated hour. Unwillingly I enter houses where the family Sits round the table at the spare repast. Sometimes they run and hide it. Bishop. Most unmannerly! Inhuman, I would add unchristianlike. Father John. Sometimes they push toward me the untasted And uninviting food, look wistfully, Press me; yet dread acceptance. Yesterday A little girl, the youngest of the five, Was raising to her lips a mealy bean (I saw no other on the unsoil'd plate) And, looking at my eyes fixt hard on hers, And thinking they were fixt upon the morsel, Pusht it between my lips, and ran away. Bishop. Brother! I should have call'd her a good child; I should myself have given the benediction With my own hand, and placed it on her head: I wonder you don't praise her. Brother John! I have my nones to run thro'; so, good-by. Father John. Just God! does this house stand? Dark are thy ways, Inscrutable! Be thy right hand our guide! SCENE II. SENATE-HOUSE. Senators. Consul. Consul. Senators! ye have call'd me to debate On our condition. Senator. Consul! we are lost. Consul. All are who think so. Second Senator. Even the best want food. Consul. The bravest do. Third Senator. How shall men fight without it? Fourth Senator. Concord and peace might have return'd. Consul. By yielding, Think ye? Not they: contempt and sorrow might. Can there be ever concord (peace there may be) Between the German and Italian? None. Remember how that ancient city fell, Milano. Seven whole years resisted she The imperial sword: she listened to conditions And fell. The soldiers of His Majesty . . His soldiers, ay, his very court . . shed tears At such affliction, at such utter ruin, At such wide wails, such universal woe. They all were equal then; for all were slaves, Scatter'd, the poor, the rich, the brave, the coward, Thro' Bergamo, Pavia, Lodi, Como, The cities of the enemy. There stood No vestige of the walls, no church to pray in . . And what was left to pray for? What but Cæsar? Throw rather all your wealth into the sea Than let the robber priest lay hold upon it, And, if ye die of famine, die at least In your own houses while they are your own. But there are many yet whose hearts and arms Will save you all: to-day you all can fight, The enemy shall feed you all to-morrow. Were it no shame a priest should seize the prey That kings and emperors dropt with broken talon? The eagle flew before your shouts; and now A vulture must swoop down! but vultures keep From living men and from warm blood; they revel (And most the Roman vulture) in corruption. Have ye forgotten how your fathers fought, When Totila with Goths invincible Besieged you; not with priests and choristers; When twenty-seven ships assail'd your port And when eleven only ever left it? Rome fell before him twice; not once Ancona. Your fathers saved the city . . ye shall save her. Senator. Weapons are insufficient; courage, vows, Avail not. We are unprepared for war: Scanty was our last harvest: and these winds Are adverse. They know that who now defy us, Blockading us alike by sea and land. Consul. We some are poor, we some are prosperous, We all alike owe all we have: the air Is life alike to all, the sun is warmth, The earth, its fruits and flocks, are nutriment, Children and wives are comforts; all partake (Or may partake) in these. Shall hoarded grain Or gold be less in common, when the arms That guard it are not those that piled it up, But those that shrink without it? Come, ye rich, Be richer still: strengthen your brave defenders, And make all yours that was not yours before. Dares one be affluent where ten thousand starve? Open your treasuries, your granaries, But throw mine open first. Another year Will roughen this equality again, The rich be what they were; the poor . . alas! What they were too perhaps . . but every man More happy, each one having done his duty. Senator (to another). Hark! the young fools applaud! they rise around; They hem him in; they seize and kiss his hand; He shakes our best supporters. Another. Give the sign. To those without. [People enter.] Consul. Who called you hither? [Various voices. First. Want. Second. Famine. Third. Our families. Fourth. I had three sons; One hath been slain, one wounded. Fifth. Only one Had I: my loss is greatest. Sixth. Grant us peace. Sir Consul, peace we plead for, only peace. Consul. Will peace bring back the dead? will peace restore Lost honour? will peace heal the wounds your sons And brothers writhe with? They who gave those wounds Shall carry home severer, if they live, And never in my consulate shall laugh At those brave men whom men less brave desert. True, some have fallen: but before they fell They won the field; nor now can earthly power Take from their cold clencht hands the spoil they grasp; No mortal spoil, but glory. Life, my sons, Life may lose all: the seal that none can break Hath stampt their names, all registered above. Senator (to a Man near). Speak; you poor fool! speak loudly, or expect From me no favour . . and tell that man next. Man. Oh! we are starving. Consul. Better starve than serve. Another. He has no pity. Consul. What is that I hear? I have no pity. Have I not a daughter? Another. O what a daughter! How compassionate! How charitable! Had she been born poor She could not more have pitied poverty. Consul. Two ounces of coarse bread, wine, which she loathes, And nothing more, sustain her. Another. God sustains her; He will not leave his fairest work to perish. Consul. Fight then, fight bravely, while ye can, my friends! In God have confidence, if none in me. [Shouts of applause. Part of the People leave the Senators.] Senator (to another). Seducer of the people! shall it end Thus vilely? [To the Consul.] You have stores at home, Sir Consul! You have wide lands. Another Senator. You should support your order. Consul. My order! God made one; of that am I. Stores, it appears, I have at home; wide lands; Are those at home too? or within my reach? Paternal lands I do inherit; wide They are enough, but stony, mountainous, The greater part unprofitable. Senator. Some The richest in rich wine. Consul. Few days ago Nearly a hundred barrels were unbroached. Another Senator. A hundred loaves, tho' small indeed and dry, Would they be worth in such distress as ours. We could raise half among us. Consul. Shame upon you! Had not your unwise laws and unfair thrift Prohibited the entrance of supplies While they could enter, never had this famine Stalked through the people. Senator. But the laws are laws. Consul. Yours; never theirs. Another Senator. Why thus inflame the people? Consul. Who brought the people hither? for what end? To serve you in your avarice; to cry peace! Not knowing peace from servitude. Senator. For quiet, Spare them at least a portion of the wine. Consul. Nor them nor you; nor price nor force shall gain it. People. Are we to perish? Hunger if we must, Let us be strengthen'd by a draught of wine To bear it on. Senator. Wine is the oil of life, And the lamp burns with it which else were spent. People. Sir Consul! we forbear; we honour you, But tell us, ere we sink, where one flask lies. Consul. Go ask the women labouring of child, Ask those who nurse their infants, ask the old, Who can not fight, ask those who fought the best, The wounded, maim'd, disabled, the Anconites. Sirs! if ye find one flask within our cellar, Crack it, and throw the fragments in my face. People. Let us away. [Shouts of applause. Consul. Follow me to the walls; And you, too, senators, learn there your duty. People. We swear to do our best. Consul. Sworn wisely! Life Is now more surely to be won by arms Than death is, and the sword alone can win it. I lead the way; let who will lag behind. SCENE III. THE CITY. Paolucci, Officers, Citizens. Officer. The Consul has been wounded. Who is left To lead us? and what leader would suffice? The strongest sink with famine, lying down Along the battlements, and only raised When sounds the trumpet. First Citizen. And most fall again. Second Citizen. Our day is come, the day of our disgrace. Paolucci. Ours never was that day, and never shall be. Ye may have lost your consul (let us hope He is not lost to us) but we are sure His memory and example yet remain With all their life in them. [To the People.] Young men! perhaps Ye know me not: your fathers knew me well; Their fathers better. Three-score years ago I was your consul: none then preached surrender; And let none now: yet there were those around Who would have pinfolded the quiet flock As gladly as yon shepherd at the gate. People. We can resist no longer. Who can count The slain? Paulucci. Say, rather, who can praise the slain? Glorified souls! happy your sleep! ye hear No shameful speech from brethren! People. Arms alone Should not subdue us: famine has: we starve. Paolucci. While life remains life's sufferings will arise, Whether from famine or from sharper sting Than famine: upon every hearth almost There creeps some scorpion never seen till felt. But until every arm that guards our walls Drop helpless at the starting ribs, until That hour, stand all united. Ye despair Untimely. He who rules as rules us well, Exciting no false hope, as bad men do When they have led where none can extricate. I was your consul while the king Lothaire Besieged the city, proud as any prelate, Swearing he would reduce it. Other kings Have sworn the same . . and kept their word like kings . . Cursing and flying. We have met brave foes; But they met braver. Fly; and let the crook Drag a vile flock back from its flight to slaughter. All. We scorn the thought. But where lies human help? Paolucci. I may be spared to seek it, spared to try If one brave man breathes yet among the powerful. Who knows not Marchesella? Officer. Brave he is, But mindful of the emperor. He saw Milano, which had stood two thousand years, Sink; every tree, on hill or vale, cut down, The vine, the olive, ripe and unripe corn Burnt by this minister of God. Throughout There was no shade for sick men to die under, There was no branch to strew upon the bier. Another Officer. His father was courageous, why not he? A third Officer. Above all living men is Marchesella Courageous: but pray what are our deserts With him, that he should hazard for our sake His lordly castles and his wide domains? Perhaps his fame in arms! 'Twere mad to hope it. Prudence, we know, for ever guides his courage. Paolucci. If generous pity dwells not in his house, As once it did, with every other virtue, Seek it, where brave men never seek in vain, In woman's breast: away to Bertinoro: Take heart: the countess is a Frangipani: There are a thousand trumpets in that name: Methinks I hear them blowing toward Ancona. Old men talk long: but be not ye so idle: Hie to the walls: I will sue her. To arms! To arms! the consul of past years commands you. SCENE IV. CONSUL'S HOUSE. Paolucci. Consul. Erminia. Paolucci. Consul! how fare you? Consul. Not amiss. Paolucci. But wounded? Consul. There was more blood than wound, they say who saw it. Erminia. My father, sir, slept well all night. Paolucci. All night An angel watched him; he must needs sleep well. Consul. I drove away that little fly in vain, It flutter'd round the fruit whose skin was broken. Erminia. Sweet father! talk not so; nor much at all. Paolucci. Consul! I have not many days of life, As you may see; and old men are in want Of many little things which those in power Can give: and 'twere amiss to hold them back Because unclaim'd before. Consul. I well remember, Though then a child, how all this city praised Your wisdowm, zeal, and probity, when consul. Ancona then was flourishing; but never Were those compensated who served their country, Except by serving her; 'twas thought enough; We think so still. Beside, the treasury Is emptied, that it may procure us food And troops. Be sure the very first that eats The strangers' corn (if any reach our port) Shall be no other than yourself: your age And virtue merit from us this distinction. Paolucci. Sir Consul! I want more than that. Consul. Receive it And welcome from the father and the man, Not from the consul. Now would you yourself Act differently (I ask) on this occasion? Paolucci. More kindly, no; but differently, yes. Consul. What would you from me? Paolucci. High distinction, consul! Consul. I will propose it, as I justly may, And do regret it has been so deferred. Paolucci. May I speak plainly what ambition prompts? Consul. I hear all claims. Paolucci. Those sacks hold heavy sums. Consul. Avarice was never yet imputed to you. Paolucci. 'Tis said you can not move them from the town. Consul. Difficult, dangerous, doubtful, such attempt. The young Stamura loves bold enterprises, And may succeed where others would despair: But, such the lack of all that life requires Even for a day, I dare not send one loaf Aboard his bark. Hunger would urge the many To rush and seize it. Paolucci. They would not seize me. One loaf there is at home: that boy shall share it. Erminia. He would not, though he pined. Consul. A youth so abstinent I never knew. Paolucci. But when we are afloat . . Consul. We shall not be: We think not of escape. Paolucci. No: God forbid! We will meet safety in the path of honour. Consul. Why say afloat then? Paolucci. Only he and I. This is the guerdon I demand, the crown Of my grey hairs. Erminia. Alas! what aid could either Afford the other? O sir! do not go! You are too old; he much too rash . . Dear father! If you have power, if you have love, forbid it! Paolucci. It was advised that younger ones should go: Some were too daring, some were too despondent: I am between these two extremes. Consul. Paolucci. But think Again! Paolucci. I have no time for many thoughts, And I have chosen out of them the best. Erminia. He never will return! he goes to die! I knew he would! Consul. His days have been prolonged Beyond the days of man: and there goes with him One who sees every danger but his own. SCENE V. SEASIDE. NIGHT. Paolucci, Stamura. Paolucci. I feel the spray upon my face already. Is the wind fair? Stamura. 'Tis fiercely fair. Paolucci. The weather Can not be foul then. Stamura (lifting him aboard). Sit down here. Don't tremble. Paolucci. Then tell the breeze to wax a trifle warmer, And lay thy hand upon those hissing waves. She grates the gravel . . We are off at last. ACT IV. SCENE I. CASTLE OF BERTINORO. Countess of Bertinoro, Marchesella, Paolucci, and Stamura. Page. My lady! here are two such men as never Enter'd a palace-gate. Countess. Who are they? Page. One Older than anything I ever saw, Alive or dead; the other a stout youth, Guiding him, and commanding all around To stand aside, and give that elder way; At first with gentle words, and then with stern. Coarse their habiliments, their beards unshorn, Yet they insist on entrance to my lady. Countess. Admit the elder, but exclude the other. Wait. [To Marchesella. If the younger be his son, what little Of service I may render to the father Will scarce atone for keeping him apart. [To the Page. Go; bid them enter; both. [Stamura, having led Paolucci in, retires. Paolucci. I come, O countess! Imploring of your gentleness and pity, To save from fire and sword, and, worse than either, Worse, and more imminent, to save from famine The few brave left, the many virtuous, Virgins and mothers (save them!) in Ancona. Countess. Nay, fall not at my knee. Age must not that . . Raise him, good Marchesella! Paolucci. You too, here, Illustrious lord? Marchesella. What! and art thou still living, Paolucci? faithful, hospitable soul! We have not met since childhood . . mine, I mean. Paolucci. Smile not, my gentle lord! too gracious then, Be now more gracious; not in looks or speech, But in such deeds as you can best perform. Friendship another time might plead for us; Now bear we what our enemy would else Seize from us, all the treasures of our city, To throw them at your feet for instant aid. Help, or we perish. Famine has begun . . Begun? has almost ended . . with Ancona. Countess. Already? We have been too dilatory. Marchesella. I could not raise the money on my lands Earlier; it now is come. I want not yours: Place it for safety in this castle-keep, If such our lady's pleasure. Countess. Until peace. Marchesella. My troops are on the march. Countess. And mine not yet? Repose you, sir! they shall arrive with you, Or sooner. Is that modest youth your son? Paolucci. Where is he? gone again? Countess. When you first enter'd. Paolucci. Some angel whisper'd your benign intent Into his ear, else had he never left me. My son? Who would not proudly call him so? Soon shall you hear what mother bore the boy, And where he dash'd the galleys, while that mother Fired their pine towers, already wheel'd against Our walls, and gave us time . . for what? to perish. Marchesella. No, by the saints above! not yet, not yet. [Trumpet sounds. Countess. Merenda is announced. Sir, I entreat you To lead me! Grant one favour more; and hint not To our young friend that we have learnt his prowess. [To a Page. Conduct the noble youth who waits without. SCENE II. Countess, Marchesella, Paolucci, Stamura, at Table. Countess (to Stamura). Sir, there are seasons when 'tis incivility To ask a name; 'twould now be more uncivil To hesitate. Stamura. Antonio is my name. Countess. Baptismal. Pray, the family? Stamura. Stamura; But that my honour'd father gave in marriage To her who wears it brighter day by day: She calls me rather by the name he bore. Countess. It must be known and cherisht. Stamura. By the bravest And most enduring in my native place; It goes no farther: we are but just noble. Countess. He who could heed the tempest, and make serve Unruly ocean, not for wealth, nor harm To any but the spoiler, high above That ocean, high above that tempest's wing, He needs no turret to abut his name, He needs no crescent to stream light on it, Nor castellan, nor seneschal, nor herald. Paolucci. Ha! boy, those words make thy breast rise and fall, Haply as much as did the waves. The town Could ill repay thee; Beauty overpays. Countess. Talk what the young should hear; nor see the meed Of glorious deeds in transitory tints, Fainter or brighter. Paolucci. I was wrong. Countess. Not quite: For beauty, in thy native town, young man, May feel her worth in recompensing thine. Stamura (aside). Alas! alas! she perishes! while here We tarry. Paolucci (overhearing). She? Who perishes? Stamura. The town. Paolucci. How the boy blushes at that noble praise! Countess. They blush at glory who deserve it most. . . Blushes soon go: the dawn alone is red. Stamura. We know what duty, not what glory is. The very best among us are not rich Nor powerful. Countess. Are they anywhere? Paolucci. His deeds, If glorious in themselves, require no glory. Even this siege, those sufferings, who shall heed? Countess. He gives most light by being not too high. Remember by what weapon fell the chief Of Philistines. Did brazen chariots, driven By giants, roll against him? From the brook, Striking another such, another day, A little pebble stretcht the enormous bulk That would have fill'd it and have turn'd its course. And in the great deliverers of mankind Whom find ye? Those whom varlet pipers praise. The greatest of them all, by all adored, Did Babylon from brazen-belted gate, Not humble straw-rooft Bethlehem, send forth? We must not be too serious. Let us hear How were the cables cut. Paolucci. I saw the shears That clipt them. Father John, before he went, Show'd me them, how they workt. He himself held The double crescent of sharp steel, in form Like that swart insect's which you shake from fruit About the kernel. This enclaspt the cable; And too long handles (a stout youth, at each Extremity, pushing with all his strength Right forward) sunder'd it. Then swiftly flew One vessel to the shore; and then another: And hardly had the youths or Father John Time to take breath upon the upper wave, When down they sank again and there swang round Another prow, and dasht upon the mole. Then many blithe Venetians fell transfixt With arrows, many sprang into the sea And cried for mercy. Upon deck appeared The pope's own nephew, who ('tis said) had come To arbitrate. He leapt into a boat Which swam aside, most gorgeously array'd, And this young man leapt after him and seized him. He, when he saw a dagger at his throat, Bade all his crew, four well-built men, surrender. Stamura. They could not have feared me: they saw our archers. Countess. And where is now your prisoner? Stamura. He desired An audience of the consul. Countess. To what end? Stamura. I know not: I believe to court his daughter. Countess. Is the girl handsome? Is that question harder Than what I askt before? Will he succeed? Stamura. Could he but save from famine our poor city, And . . could he make her happy . . Countess. Pray go on. It would delight you then to see him win her? Stamura. O that I had not saved him! or myself! Countess. She loves him then? And you hate foreigners. I do believe you like the fair Erminia Yourself. Stamura. She hates me. Who likes those that hate him? Countess. I never saw such hatred as you bear her: If she bears you the like . . Stamura. She can do now No worse than what she has done. Countess. Who knows that? I am resolved to see. Stamura. O lady Countess! How have I made an enemy of you? Place me the lowest of your band, but never Affront her with the mention of my name. When the great work which you have undertaken Is done, admit me in your castle-walls, And never let me see our own again. Countess. I think I may accomplish what you wish; But, recollect, I make no promises. SCENE III. OPEN SPACE NEAR THE BALISTA GATE IN ANCONA. The Lady Malaspina, her Infant, and a Soldier. Soldier. I am worn down with famine, and can live But few hours more. L. Malaspina. I have no food. Soldier. Nor food Could I now swallow. Bring me water, water! L. Malaspina. Alas! I can not. Strive to gain the fountain. Soldier. I have been nigh. L. Malaspina. And could not reach it? Soldier. Crowds I might pierce through, but how thrust back their cries? They madden'd me to flight ere half-way in. Some upright . . no, none that . . but some unfallen, Yet pressing down with their light weight the weaker. The brows of some were bent down to their knees, Others (the hair seized fast by those behind) Lifted for the last time their eyes to heaven; And there were waves of heads one moment's space Seen, then unseen forever. Wails rose up Half stifled underfoot, from children some, And some from those who bore them. L. Malaspina. Mercy! mercy! O blessed Virgin! thou wert mother too! How didst thou suffer! how did He! Save, save At least the infants, if all else must perish. Soldier! brave soldier! dost thou weep? then hope. Soldier. I suffer'd for myself; deserve I mercy? L. Malaspina. He who speaks thus shall find it. Try to rise. Soldier. No: could I reach the fountain in my thirst, I would not. L. Malaspina. Life is sweet. Soldier. To brides, to mothers. L. Malaspina. Alas! how soon may those names pass away! I would support thee partly, wert thou willing, But my babe sleeps. Soldier. Sleep, little one, sleep on! I shall sleep too as soundly, by and by. L. Malaspina. Courage, one effort more. Soldier. And tread on children! On children clinging to my knees for strength To help them on, and with enough yet left To pull me down, but others pull down them. God! let me bear this thirst, but never more Bear this sad sight! Tread on those tiny hands Clasping the dust! See those dim eyes upturn'd, Those rigid lips reproachless! Man may stir, Woman may shake, my soul; but children, children! O God! those are thine own! make haste to help them! Happy that babe! L. Malaspina. Thou art humane. Soldier. 'Tis said That hunger is almost as bad as wealth To make men selfish; but such feebleness Comes over me, all things look dim around, And life most dim, and least worth looking after. L. Malaspina. I pity thee. Day after day myself Have lived on things unmeet for sustenance. My milk is failing . . Rise . . (To the Child) My little one! God will feed thee! Be sleep thy nourisher Until his mercies strengthen me afresh! Sink not: take heart: advance: Here, where from heaven The Virgin-mother can alone behold us, Draw some few drops. [The tocsin sounds. Soldier. Ha! my ears boom thro' faintness. What sounds? L. Malaspina. The bell. Soldier. Then they are at the gate . . I can but thank you . . Give me force, O Heaven! For this last fight! . . and keep from harm these twain! Malaspina and Child alone.L. Malaspina. And still thou sleepest, my sweet babe! Is death Like sleep? Ah, who then, who would fear to die? How beautiful is all serenity! Sleep, a child's sleep, O how far more serene, And O, how far more beautiful than any! Whether we breathe so gently or breathe not, Slight is the difference. But the pangs, the rage Of famine who can bear? . . unless to raise Her child above it! (Two Priests are passing.) First Priest. Who sits yonder? bent O'er her dead babe? as many do within Their houses! Second Priest. Surely, surely, it must be She who, not many days ago, was praised For beauty, purity, humility, Above the noblest of Anconite dames. First Priest. The Lady Malaspina? Second Priest. But methinks The babe is not dead yet. First Priest. Why think you so? Second Priest. Because she weeps not over it. First Priest. For that I think it dead. It then could pierce no more Her tender heart with its sad sobs and cries. But let us hasten from the place to give The dying their last bread, the only bread Yet unconsumed, the blessed eucharist. Even this little, now so many die, May soon be wanting. Second Priest. God will never let That greater woe befall us. [The Priests go. Malaspina. Who runs hither? [The Soldier falls before her. Art thou come back? So! thou couldst run, O vile! Soldier. Lady! your gentleness kept life within me Until four fell. L. Malaspina. Thyself unwounded? Soldier. No; If arms alone can wound the soldier's breast, They toucht me not this time; nor needed they; Famine had done what your few words achieved. L. Malaspina. They were too harsh. Forgive me! Soldier. Not the last. Those were not harsh! Enter my bosom, enter, Kind pitying words! untie there life's hard knot, And let it drop off easily! How blest! I have not robb'd the child, nor shamed the mother! [He dies. L. Malaspina. Poor soul! and the last voice he heard on earth Was bitter blame, unmerited! And whose? Mine, mine! Should they who suffer sting the sufferer? O saints above! avenge not this misdeed! What doth his hand hold out? A little crate, With german letters round its inner rim . . And . . full of wine! Yet did his lips burn white! He tasted not what might have saved his life, But brought it hither, to be scorn'd and die. [Singers are heard in the same open space before an image.] Singers! where are they? My sight swims; my strength Fails me; I can not rise, nor turn to look; But only I can pray, and never voice Prays like the sad and silent heart its last. Old Men. The village of the laurel grove The House of Loreto was not yet brought thither by the angels. Hath seen thee hovering high above, Whether pure innocence was there, Or helpless grief, or ardent prayer. O Virgin! hither turn thy view, For these are in Ancona too. Not for ourselves implore we aid, But thou art mother, thou art maid; Behold these suppliants, and secure Their humbled heads from touch impure! Maidens. Hear, maid and mother! hear our prayer! Be brave and aged men thy care! And, if they bleed, O may it be In honour of thy Son and thee! When innocence is wrong'd, we know Thy bosom ever felt the blow. Yes, pure One! there are tears above, But tears of pity, tears of love, And only from thine eyes they fall, Those eyes that watch and weep for all. [They prostrate themselves. L. Malaspina. How faintly sound those voices! altho' many; At every stave they cease, and rest upon That slender reed which only one can blow. But she has heard them! Me too she has heard. Heaviness, sleep comes over me, deep sleep: Can it, so imperturbable, be death? And do I for the last time place thy lip Where it may yet draw life from me, my child! Thou, who alone canst save him, thou wilt save. [She dies: the child on her bosom still sleeping. SCENE IV. NIGHT: THE MOLE OF ANCONA. Consul. Senator. Senator. Sir Consul, you have heard (no doubt) that fires Have been seen northward all along the sky, And angels with their flaming swords have sprung From hill to hill. With your own eyes behold No mortal power advancing. Host so numerous No king or emperor or soldan led. Consul. A host, a mighty host, is there indeed? Senator. It covers the whole range of Falcognara. Consul. Methinks some fainter lights flit scatter'dly Along the coast, more southward. Senator. The archbishop Hath seen the sign, and leads away his troops. Consul. We are too weak to follow. Can then aid Have come so soon? 'Tis but the second night Since we besought it. Senator. In one hour, one moment, Such aid can come, and has come. Think not, Consul, That force so mighty and so sudden springs From earth. And what Italian dares confront The German? Consul. What Italian! All, sir; all. ACT V. SCENE I. TENT OF MARCHESELLA, NEAR ANCONA. EARLY MORNING. Marchesella. Officers. Paolucci. Officer. My general! easily I executed Your orders. Marchesella. Have they fled, then? Officer. Altogether. Marchesella. And could you reach the gate? Officer. And enter too. Paolucci's seal unbarr'd it; not until I held two loaves above my head, and threw My sword before me. Marchesella. And what saw you then? Officer. There is a civil war within the city, And insolence and drunkenness are rife. Children and old and middle-aged were reeling, And some were slipping over, some devouring Long-podded weeds with jagged edges, cast Upon the shore. Paolucci. Famine had gone thus far (Altho' with fewer) ere we left the mole. The ancient garden-wall was overthrown To get the twisted roots of fennel out; The fruit-tree that could give no fruit gave buds; The almond's bloom was withering, but whoe'er Possest that treasure pierced the bark for gum; The mulberry sent her tardy shoot, the cane Her tenderer one; the pouting vine untied Her trellised gems; the apple-tree threw down Her load of viscous mistletoe: they all (Little it was!) did all they could for us. Marchesella. The Germans (look!) have left their tents behind: We will explore them; for your wary soldiers Suspect, and well they may, some stratagem. SCENE II. ERMINIA'S CHAMBER. Erminia. Maria. [Maria is going. Erminia calls her back. Erminia. Maria, is the countess very fair? Maria. Most beautiful. But you yourself must judge. She sent me for you in the gentlest tone, And far more anxious to see you, than you (It seems) are to see her. Erminia. I am afraid To see her. Maria. You afraid! Whom should you fear? Beautiful as she is, are not you more so? Erminia. So you may think; others think otherwise. Maria. She is so affable! When many lords Stood round about her, and the noblest of them And bravest, Marchesella, who would give His lands, his castles, even his knighthood for her . . Whom do you think she call'd to her? . . the youth Who cut the cables, and then hid himself That none might praise him . . him who brought in safety Your lover to the shore. Erminia (angrily). Whom? Maria. Whom? Stamura. Erminia. What heart could he not win . . not scorn . . not break? Maria. I do not hear those shy ones ever break A woman's heart, or win one. They may scorn; But who minds that? Erminia. Leave me. Maria. And tell the countess You hasten to her presence? Erminia. Is he there? Maria. Who? Erminia. Dull, dull creature! Maria. The brave Marchesella? Erminia. Are there none brave but he? Maria. O! then, Stamura. No: when he led her from the mole again, And she had enter'd the hall-door, he left her. Erminia. I fear'd he might be with her. Were he with her, What matter! I could wait until . . Wait! why? He would not look at me, nor I at him. Maria. No; I can answer for him. Were he born Under the waves, and never saw the sun, He could not have been colder. But you might Have lookt at him, perhaps. Erminia. Not I indeed. Maria. Few men are like him. How you hug me! Erminia. Go . . I will run first . . Go . . I am now quite ready. SCENE III. CHAMBER IN THE CONSUL'S HOUSE. Countess and Erminia. Countess. The depths of love are warmer than the shallows, Purer, and much more silent. Erminia (aside). Ah! how true! Countess. He loves you, my sweet girl; I know he does. Erminia. He says not so. Countess. Child! all men are dissemblers The generous man dissembles his best thoughts, His worst the ungenerous. Erminia. If, indeed, he loves me . . Countess. He told me so. Erminia. Ah! then he loves me not. Who, who that loves, can tell it? Countess. Who can hide it? His voice betray'd him; half his words were traitors . . To him, my sweet Erminia! not to you. What! still unhappy! [Erminia weeps Erminia. Let me weep away A part of too much happiness. Countess. I wish One more could see it. From these early showers What sweets, that never spring but once, arise! SCENE IV. Consul enters. Consul. Before you leave us, since you part to-day, From our full hearts take what lies deepest there, And what God wills beyond all sacrifice . . Our praises, our thanksgivings. Thee we hail, Protectress! But can words, can deeds, requite The debt of our deliverance? Countess. What I ask Should not infringe your freedom. Power is sweet, And victory claims something. I am fain To exercise a brief authority Within the walls, appointing you my colleague. Consul. Lady! this very night my power expires. Countess. And mine, with your connivance, shall begin. Consul. Lady! all power within the walls is yours. SCENE V. ARCH OF TRAJAN ON THE MOLE. Consul, Marchesella, Countess, Senators,&amp;c. Consul. We have no flowers to decorate the arch Whence the most glorious ruler of mankind Smiles on you, lady! and on you, who rival His valour, his humanity, his bounty. Nor are there many voices that can sing Your praises. For, alas! our poor frail nature (May it be seldom!) hears one call above The call of gratitude. The famishing Devour your bread. But, though we hear no praises, There are who sing them to their harps on high, And he who can alone reward you both Listens in all his brightness to the song. I do entreat you, blemish not your glory. No exercise of might or sovranty Can ever bring you such content again As this day's victory, these altar-prayers From rescued men, men perishing; from child And parent: every parent, every child, Who hears your name, should bless you evermore. Countess. I find, sir, I must win you through your daughter. Consul. The girl is grateful: urge her not too far: I could not, without much compunction, thwart her. Erminia! go: we meet again to-morrow. Countess. Come hither, my sweet girl! Coy as thou art, I have seen one, once in my life, as coy. Stand forth thou skulking youth! Here is no sea To cover thee; no ships to scatter. Take This maiden's hand . . unless her sire forbid . . Holdest thou back? after confession too! I will reveal it. To Erminia. And art thou ashamed? Erminia. I am ashamed. Countess. Of what? thou simpleton? Erminia. I know not what . . of having been ashamed. Consul. Antonio! if thou truly lovedst her, What, after deeds so valiant, kept thee silent? Stamura. Inferior rank, deep reverence, due fear. I know who rules our country. Consul. I, who saved her. [Father John enters. F. John. What! and am I to be without reward? Consul. Father! be sure it will be voted you. Marchesella. And may not we too make our pious offerings, For such they are, when such men will receive them. F. John. I claim the hand of the affianced. Girl! Shrink not from me! Give it to God! Erminia. 'Tis given: I can not, would not, will not, take it back. F. John. Refractory! hast thou not dedicated To God thy heart and soul? Erminia. I might have done it Had never this day shone. F. John. And that youth's deeds Outshone this day, or any day before. When thou didst give thy hand to the deliverer Whom God had chosen for us, then didst thou Accomplish his great work, else incomplete. I claim to pour his benediction on you And yours for ever. Much, much misery, Have I inflicted on the young and brave, And can not so repent me as I should; But 'twas in one day only my device Ever wrought woe on any man alive. [Paolucci enters. Consul. Who enters? Paolucci. Who? The bridesman. (embracing him). My brave friend! My father's! Paolucci. Ay, thy grandfather's to boot. And there was one, about my age, before him, Sir Stefano, who wore a certain rose, Radiant with pearls and rubies and pure gold, Above the horse-tail grappled from the Turk. Marchesella. We have not in the house that ornament. Paolucci. I do believe he wears it in the grave. Countess. There is a sword here bright enough to throw A lustre on Stamura. Marchesella! Marchesella. Kneel, sir! [He kneels to Erminia. Countess. Not there. Marchesella. Yes, there; what fitter place? We know but one high title in the world, One only set apart for deeds of valour, And palsied be the hand that ill confers it. Here is the field of battle; here I knight thee. [Knights him. Rise, my compeer! Teach him his duties, lady, Toward the poor, the proud, the faith, the sex. Countess (Smiling). Stamura! would you enter now my service? Stamura. Yes, lady, were you wrong'd, this very hour; Then might I better earn the bliss I seek. ANTONY AND OCTAVIUS. Few have obtained the privilege of entering Shakespeare's garden, and of seeing him take turn after turn, quite alone, now nimbly, now gravely, on his broad and lofty terrace. Let us never venture where he is walking, whether in deep meditation or in buoyant spirits. Enough is it for us to ramble and loiter in the narrower paths below, and to look up at the various images, which, in the prodigality of his wealth, he has placed in every quarter. Before you, reader, are some scattered leaves gathered from under them: carefuller hands may arrange and compress them in a book of their own, and thus for a while preserve them, if rude children do not finger them first and tamper with their fragility. W. S. L. SCENE THE FIRST. Soothsayer and Antony. Soothsayer. Speak it I must. Ill are the auguries. Antony. Ill ever are the auguries, O priest, To those who fear them: at one hearty stroke The blackest of them scud and disappear. Now, not a word of any less than good To Cleopatra. Soothsayer. 'Twas at her command I hasten'd to consult them. Antony. Rightly done To follow her commands; not rightly comes Whate'er would grieve her; this thou must withhold. Soothsayer. Not this, not this: her very life may hang Upon the event foretold her. Antony. What is that? Announced then is the cursed augury So soon? Soothsayer. She waited at the temple-door With only one attendant, meanly drest, That none might know her; or perhaps the cause Was holier; to appease the offended Gods. Antony. Which of them can she ever have offended? She who hath lavisht upon all of them Such gifts, and burnt more incense in one hour Before her Isis, than would wrap in smoke A city at mid-day! The keenest eye Of earth or heaven could find in her no guile, No cruelty, no lack of duty. Soothsayer. True; Yet fears she one of them, nor knows she which, But Isis is the one she most suspects. Antony. Isis! her patroness, her favourite? Soothsayer. Even so! but they who patronise may frown At times, and draw some precious boon away. Antony. I deem not thus unworthily of Gods; Indeed I know but Jupiter and Mars; Each hath been ever on my side, and each Alike will prosper me, I trust, to-morrow. Soothsayer. But there are others, guardian Gods of Egypt; Prayers may propitiate them, with offerings due. Antony. I have forgotten all my prayers. Soothsayer. No need, When holier lips pronounce them. Antony. As for offerings, There shall be plenty on the day's success. Soothsayer. Merit it. Antony. Do your Gods or ours mind that? Merit! and where lies merit? Soothsayer. In true faith On auguries. Antony. Birds hither thither fly, And heard there have been from behind the veil Voices not varying much from yours and mine. SCENE THE SECOND. Soothsayer and Cleopatra. Soothsayer. Our lord Antonius wafts away all doubt Of his success. Cleopatra. What! against signs and tokens? Soothsayer. Even so! Cleopatra. Perhaps he trusts himself to Hercules, Become of late progenitor to him. Soothsayer. Ah! that sweet smile might bring him back; he once Was flexible to the bland warmth of smiles. Cleopatra. If Hercules is hail'd by men below For strength and goodness, why not Antony? Why not succeed as lawful heir? why not Exchange the myrtle for the poplar crown? Antony enters. Soothsayer goes. Cleopatra. Antony! is not Cæsar now a god? Antony. We hear so. Cleopatra. Nay, we know it. Why not thou? Men would not venture then to strike a blow At thee: the laws declare it sacrilege. Antony. Julius, if I knew Julius, had been rather First among men and last among the Gods. Cleopatra. At least put on thy head a kingly crown. Antony. I have put on a laurel one already; As many kingly crowns as should half cover The Lybian desert are not worth this one. Cleopatra. But all would bend before thee. Antony. 'Twas the fault Of Cæsar to adopt it; 'twas his death. Cleopatra. Be then what Cæsar is. O Antony! To laugh so loud becomes not state so high. Antony. He is a star, we see; so is the hair Of Berenice: stars and Gods are rife. What worth, my love, are crowns? Thou givest pearls, I give the circlet that encloses them. Handmaidens don such gear, and valets snatch it Sportively off, and toss it back again. Cleopatra. But graver men gaze up with awful eyes. Antony. And never gaze at that artificer, Who turns his heel and fashions out his vase From the Nile clay! 'Tis easy work for him; Easy was mine to turn forth kings from stuff As vile and ductile: he still plies his trade, But mine, with all my customers, is gone. Ever by me let enemies be awed, None else: bring round me many, near me few, Keeping afar those shaven knaves obscene Who lord it with humility, who press Men's shoulders down, glue their two hands together, And cut a cubit off, and tuck their heels Against the cushion mother Nature gave. Cleopatra. Incomprehensible! incorrigible! O wretch! if queens were ever taught to blush, I should at such unseemly phrase as thine. I think I must forgive it. What! and take Before I grant? Again! You violent man! Will you for ever drive me thus away? SCENE THE THIRD. Antony and Cleopatra. Antony. What demon urged thy flight? Cleopatra. The demon Love. I am a woman, with a woman's fears, A mother's, and, alas O Antony! More fears than these. Antony. Of whom? Cleopatra. Ask not of whom But ask for whom, if thou must ask at all, Nor knowest nor hast known. Yes, I did fear For my own life . . ah! lies it not in thine? How many perils compast thee around! Antony. What are the perils that are strange to me? Cleopatra. Mine thou couldst not have seen when swiftest oars, Attracted by the throne and canopy, Pounced at me only, numerous as the waves; Couldst not have seen my maidens throwing down Their fans and posies (piteous to behold!) That they might wring their hands more readily. I was too faint myself to still their cries. Antony (aside). I almost thought her blameable. (To Cleopatra.) The Gods So will'd it. Thou despondest . . too aware The day is lost. Cleopatra. The day may have been lost, But other days, and happier ones, will come. Antony. Never: when those so high once fall, their weight Keeps them for ever down. Cleopatra. Talk reasonably, And love me as . . till now . . it should be more, For love and sorrow mingle where they meet. Antony. It shall be more. Are these last kisses cold? Cleopatra. Nor cold are they nor shall they be the last. Antony. Promise me, Cleopatra, one thing more. Cleopatra. 'Tis promist, and now tell me what it is. Antony. Rememberest thou this ring? Cleopatra. Dost thou remember The day, my Antony, when it was given? Antony. Day happiest in a life of many happy, And all thy gift. Cleopatra. 'Tis call'd the richest ruby, The heaviest, and the deepest, in the world. Antony. The richest certainly. Cleopatra. And not the deepest And broadest? Look! it hides all this large nail, And mine are long ones if not very wide; Now let me see if it don't cover yours As wide again! there! it would cover two. Why smile you so? Antony. Because I know its story. Cleopatra. Ha! then you have not lost all memory quite. I told it you. The king of Pontus sent it When dying to my father, warning him By letter that there was a charm in it Not to be trifled with. Antony. It shall not be. Cleopatra. But tell me now the promise I must make; What has the ring to do with it? Antony. All, all. Know, Cleopatra, this is not one ruby. Cleopatra. The value then is smaller. Antony. Say not so, Remark the rim. Cleopatra. The gold is thin, I see. Antony. And seest thou it will open? It contains Another jewel, richer than itself. Cleopatra. Impossible! my Antony! for rubies Are richer than all other gems on earth. Antony. Now, my sweet trifler, for thy promise. Cleopatra. Speak. By all the Powers above and all below, I will perform thy bidding, even to death. Antony. To death it goes; not until after mine. Cleopatra. I kiss the precious charm. Methinks an odour Of almond comes from it. How sweet the flower Of death! Antony. 'Tis painless death, 'tis sudden too. Cleopatra. Who could wish more, even were there more to wish? With us there is not. Antony. Generous, pious girl! Daughter of Ptolemies! thou hast not won A lower man than they. Thy name shall rise Above the pyramids, above the stars, Nations yet wild shall that name civilize, And glorious poets shake their theatres, And stagger kings and emperors with applause. Cleopatra. I was not born to die; but I was born To leave the world with Antony, and will. Antony. The greatest of all eastern kings died thus, The greater than all eastern kings thus died. O glorious forgeman who couldst rivet down Refractory crowds by thousands, and make quake Sceptres like reeds! we want not here thy voice Or thy example. Antony alone And queenly pride, tho' Love were dumb, would do. SCENE THE FOURTH. Cleopatra. Charmian. Iras. Cleopatra. At the first entrance of your lord, before He ordered you, before he spake a word, Why did ye run away? Charmian. I was afraid, Never so in my life; he lookt so fierce He fear'd his own wild eyes, he placed one hand (His right) across them on lowered brow, his left Waved us away as would a hurricane A palm-tree on the desert. Cleopatra (to Iras). And wert thou, Iras, so terrified? Iras. Not I indeed; My lady, never man shall frighten me. Cleopatra. Thou silly creature! I have seen a mouse Do it. Iras. A mouse is quite another thing. Charmian (hesitating). Our lord and master . . Cleopatra. What of Antony? Charmian. Octavius . . Cleopatra. Who? Our lord and master he? He never shall be mine . . that is to say . . Charmian. What! lady? Cleopatra. I forget . . 'twas not worth saying. Charmian! where hast thou been this last half-hour? Charmian. In my own room. Cleopatra. So fearful? Charmian. Far more sad. Cleopatra. Where, Iras, thou? Iras. I wanted to report To my sweet lady what I might espy. Cleopatra. And what have those long narrow eyes espied? Iras. All. Cleopatra. 'Twas done speedily; but what is all? Army and fleet from any terrace roof Are quite discernible, the separate men Nowhere. Iras. My heart had told me what delight Its queen would feel to hear exactly how The leaders look. Cleopatra. And how then did they look? Tell me: some might have ridden near enough To town to judge by, where the sight is sharp. Iras. Merciful Isis! ridden! and so close! Horses are frightful, horses kick and rear And whinny, full of wickedness; 'twere rash To venture nigh them. Cleopatra. There are things more rash. Iras. Quieter creatures than those generals are Never were seen. Cleopatra. Barbarians! not a word About them, Iras, if thou lovest me; They would destroy my city, seize my realm, And ruin him we live for. Iras. Surely no; It were a pity; none are so unkind; Cæsar the least of all. Cleopatra. Ah simple child! Thou knowest not his heart. Iras. I do indeed. Cleopatra. No, nor thy own. Iras. His better; for of mine I never askt a question. He himself Told me how good he would be. Cleopatra. He told thee? What! hast thou seen him? Iras. Aye, and face to face, Close as our lord's to yours. Cleopatra. O impudence! Iras. But he would have it so; just like our lord. Cleopatra. Impudent girl! thou shalt be whipt for this. Iras. I am too old; but lotuses don't hurt Like other things; they cool the strokes they give. Cleopatra. I have no patience with thee. How I hate That boy Octavius! Dared he touch thy cheek? Iras. He could; he only whispered in my ear, Holding it by the ring. Cleopatra. Whispered? what words? Iras. The kindest. Cleopatra. Ah! no doubt! but what were they? Iras. He said, The loveliest creature in the world . . Cleopatra. The vulgar brute! Our ferrymen talk so: And couldst thou listen, Iras, to such speech? Iras. Only when people praise our gracious queen. Cleopatra. Me? this of me? Thou didst thy duty, child: He might have fail'd in what he would express. The birds have different voices, yet we bear To hear those sing which do not sing the best. Iras! I never thought thee half so wise. And so, he said those gentle words of me? Iras. All, and forgot to kiss me when I vow'd I would report them faithfully. Cleopatra. Is there Resemblance in him to that marble image I would have broken, but my Antony Seiz'd both my hands? Iras. Alas! that image wants The radiant eyes, and hair more radiant still, Such as Apollo's may have been if myrrh Were sprinkled into its redundant waves. Cleopatra. He must be tenderer than I fanced him If this be true. Iras. He spoke those very words. Cleopatra. Iras! 'tis vain to mind the words of men; But if he lookt as thou hast said he lookt, I think I may put trust in him. Iras. And see him? Cleopatra. I am not hasty. Iras. If you could but see him! Cleopatra. Call Charmian: I am weary: I must rest Awhile. Iras. My sweetest lady! could not I, Who have been used to it almost a year, Help you as well as Charmian? While you sleep Could I not go again and bid him haste To comfort you? Cleopatra. Is the girl mad? Call Charmian. (To Charmian.) Charmian! hath Iras tickled thee away From moping in thy chamber? thou hast sped. Charmian. Iras is growing bold. Cleopatra. I was bold too While I was innocent as Iras is. Charmian. Our lady looks more flurried than deprest. Cleopatra. I am not flurried, I am not deprest. [After a pause. Believest thou in Cæsar's generosity? Charmian. I know it. Cleopatra. In what matter? Charmian. Half the guards And half the ministers of state have shown Signs of his bounty to the other half. Cleopatra. Gifts are poor signs of bounty. Do not slaves Slip off the gold-black pouches from their necks Untied but to buy other slaves therewith? Do not tame creatures lure into the trap Their wilder brethren with some filthy bait? All want companions, and the worst the most. I am much troubled: even hope troubles me. Charmian. I dare not ask our lady why she weeps. Cleopatra. Cæsarion, my first-born, my dearest one, Is safely shielded by his father's name: He loves his brothers, he may save them both, He only can: I would fain take the advice Of Dolabella, fain would venture him In Cæsar's camp: the father's voice and look Must melt him, for his heart is not so hard That he could hurt so beautiful a child; Nay, what man's is? Charmian. But trust not the two younger; Their father will not help them in their need. Cleopatra. Cæsarion in fit hour will plead for them. Charmian, what ponderest thou? what doubtest thou? Charmian. Cæsar I doubt, and Dolabella more; And what I pondered were your words: It may be That givers are not always benefactors. Cleopatra. I have one secret, but keep none from thee: He loves me! Charmian. All do. Cleopatra. Yes, but some have power. Charmian. Power, as most power is, gain'd by treachery. Cleopatra. Whom, In Egypt, Europe, Asia, can I trust? Charmian. Few, nor those few too far, nor without watch. Cleopatra. Not Charmian? Charmian. Bid her die; here; now; and judge. SCENE THE FIFTH. Octavius. Mecænas. Gallus. Octavius. Is Dolabella to be trusted? Mecænas. Youth There is on Dolabella's side; with youth Comes always eloquence where women are. Octavius. Gallus is honester and prudenter. Mecænas. But Gallus is the older by some years. Octavius. A poet says, Love at odd hours hath smiled, And covered with his pinions sportively, Where he espied some hairs that seem'd like Time's Rather than his. Mecænas. There must have been but few, Or else the poet dreamt it. Octavius. Who comes hither? Mecænas. Not Dolabella, but the better man. Octavius. Welcome, brave Gallus, opportunely met. We were debating how to lure that dove Of Antony's, now in her cote, a tower, From which we would not frighten her away, But tempt her down. Gallus. It might be difficult. Octavius. Unless thou aidest us, indeed it might. Mecænas. What sport 'twould be to see her mate descend And catch him too! Gallus. Nor this more easily. Octavius. To Gallus all is easy. Mecænas. Pleasant too Would such task be. Gallus. No better judge of pleasures Than Cilnius here? but ours are not alike. Octavius. Gallus! one word apart. We need thee much. Gallus. What! after Egypt won? Octavius. Antony lives! Gallus. Beaten, disgraced, imprisoned, his own jailer. Mecænas. Defying us, however, by the power The queen his mistress gives him with her name . . Gallus. Worthless as his. Mecænas. Were she within our reach We soon might bring him down. Gallus. What! lower? Octavius. Even yet? Gallus. She might succumb, and must, by promising That Cæsar's son, after her death, shall reign. Mecænas. A prudent thought. But will she give up Antony Unless she hear it from the giver's mouth? There is one anxious to deserve the grace Of princes. Dolabella could persuade The queen to trust herself to him for Cæsar. Gallus. I doubt it. Mecænas. Doubt his honour, not his skill. He could not keep the secret that he loves, And that he often in times past hath seen her. Gallus. He loves her? then, by all the Gods! he never Will win her for another than himself. Beside, he was the friend of Antony, And shared with him the toils at Mutina. Altho' no eagle, he would soar aloft Rather than bow for others, like an owl, The smallest of the species, hooded for it. Who knows not Dolabella? Mecænas. Thou hast sense, Comeliness, courage, frankness. Antony Tore from thy couch the fairest girl in Rome. Gallus. And let him have her, let him have her, man. What then? Mecænas. There are who would retaliate. Gallus. The girl hath left no mark upon my memory . . Mecænas. Or mine, beside a few soft lines; but mine Retains them, mindful of a friend who sang, Unless my singing mars the harmony, I thought it once an idle tale That lovely woman's faith could fail; At last I said, It may be true, Lycoris, of them all but you. And now you leave me! and you go O'er pinnacles of Alpine snow. Another leads you (woe is me!) Across that grim and ghastly sea! Let him protect those eyes from sleet, And guide and chafe those tender feet, And fear for every step you tread, Then hardly will I wish him dead. If ice-barb'd shafts that ring around By his neglect my false one wound, O may the avenging Gods for this Freeze him to death in the abyss! Gallus. They have reserved him for a sadder fate. Sleep, without painful dreams that crush the breast, Sleep, without any joyous ones that come Only to mock the awaken'd, comes unfelt And unsolicited among those cliffs Of ice perennial. Antony hath dreamt His broken dream, and wakened to despair: I never wisht him that; the harm I wisht him Was when my youth was madder than his age. He stood a prouder and a better man At Mutina, when Famine walkt the camp, When I beheld him climb up painfully A low and crumbling crag, where servises Hung out above his head their unripe fruit: That was my day. Some grains of sodden maize I brought and offered him: he struck them down. Octavius. Rejoice at pride so humbled. Gallus. I rejoice At humbled pride, at humbled valour no. Octavius. But those offending Gods whom thou invokedst Stand now before thee and demand why call'd. Gallus. They know: they pardon such irresolution As pity, and not cowardice, persuades. One woman has betraid me; not one woman Will I betray. Mecænas. O that poetic mind! Gallus. Where others sneer, Mecænas only smiles. Mecænas. Such is my nature, and I widely err, Gallus, if such be not thy nature too. Octavius. Did then Lycoris, that wild girl, prefer The unworthy to the worthy, the most rude To the most gentle, scampering beyond reach? Let her repair her fault: no danger here That angry skies turn coral lips to slate Or icicles make limp the runaway. Gallus. Those days are over. He, who won the prize May say as much and add a little more. Octavius. Laughest thou not to see the tables turn'd? The little queen who fascinates her fool Is now as lovely as Lycoris was, And never ran away from any man: Fain would I see that roysterer's spirit broken, And she alone can do it: help her on. Gallus. In any such attempt, in such a place Fortune would baffle me. Octavius. Then baffle her; She baffles only those who hesitate. Gallus. The queen, we hear, takes refuge in the depths Below the palace, where but reptiles lie. Octavius. Indeed! what! scorpions, serpents? Gallus. Haply these. Octavius. Poor woman! they may bite her! let my fears Prove not prophetic! Now, my friend, adieu! Reflect upon our project; turn it over. [Gallus goes. These poets look into futurity And bring us glimpses from it more than dreams. Asps! But the triumph then without the queen! Alas! was ever mortal so perplext! I doubt if your friend Gallus can be won. Mecænas. All may be won, well handled; but the ear Is not the thing to hold by. Show men gold, Entangle them in Gallic torquises, Tie stubborn necks with ropes of blushing pearls, Seat them on ivory from the realms of Ind, Augur them consulates, proconsulates, Make their eyes widen into provinces, And, gleaming further onward, tetrarchies. Octavius. It strikes me now that we may offer Gallus The prefecture of Egypt. Mecænas. Some time hence: Better consult Agrippa. Octavius. None more trusty. Yet our Agrippa hath strange whims; he dotes Upon old Rome, the Rome of matted beards And of curt tunics; of old Rome's old laws, Worm-eaten long, now broken and swept off. [Pausing. He stands forth high in station and esteem. Mecænas. So should the man who won the world for thee. Octavius. I must not play with him who won so much From others; he might win as much from me: I fear his fortunes. Mecænas. Bind them with your own. Becoming are thy frowns, my dear Octavius, Thy smiles alone become thee better: trust Thy earliest friend and fondest: take not ill My praises of Agrippa, tried in war And friendship. Octavius. And for this wouldst thou, my Cilnius, Send him away from me? Mecænas. Thyself did fear His popularity: all Rome applauds His valour, justice, moderation, mercy. Octavius. Not one word more. Mecænas. One word I have to speak, And speak it I will now. He must away. Octavius. Can Cilnius then be jealous of Agrippa? Mecænas. No; crown him king and give him provinces, But give him not to clench the heart of Rome. Octavius. I could make kings and unmake kings by scores, But could not make nor unmake one Agrippa. Mecænas. Well spoken! wisely! worthily! No praise Can equipoise his virtues, kings may lay Their tributes on the carpet of his throne And cities hope to honour whom they serve, The royal mantle would obscure Agrippa. Octavius. I would be generous, but be cautious too. Mecænas. Then grant him all beyond the sight of Rome; Men's eyes would draw him thither tho' his will Hung back: thus urged the steadiest might give way. Octavius. I hate suspicion and suspicious men. Gallus I fancied was the bitterest foe Of Antony, his rival, and successful, Then he should hate him worse than I. Mecænas. But empire Is more worth hatred than a silly girl, Every day to be won and lost again. Octavius. Our Gallus is weak-minded to forgive So easily. Mecænas. I find that on the hearth Where lie love's embers there lie hatred's too, Equally cold and not to be stir'd up. Octavius. I do not think, my Cilnius, thou hast felt Love but for me; I never knew thee hate. Mecænas. It is too troublesome; it rumples sleep, It settles on the dishes of the feast, It bites the fruit, it dips into the wine; Then rather let my enemy hate me Than I hate him. Octavius. We must look round. What think you? Is Dolabella to be trusted? Mecænas. Try. Octavius. I wish this country settled, us return'd. Resolved am I to do what none hath done, And only Julius ever purposed doing; Resolved to render Rome, beneath my rule, A second Alexandria. Corinth, Carthage, One autumn saw in stubble; not a wreath Enough to crown a capital was left, Nor capital to crown its pillar, none; But here behold what glorious edifices! What palaces! what temples! what august Kings! how unmoved is every countenance Above the crowd! And so it was in life. No other city in the world, from west To east, seems built for rich and poor alike. In Athens, Antioch, Miletus, Rhodes, The richest Roman could not shelter him Against the dogstar; here the poorest slave Finds refuge under granite, here he sleeps Noiseless, and, when he wakens, dips his hand Into the treasured waters of the Nile. Mecænas. I wish, Octavius, thou wouldst carry hence For thy own worship one of those mild Gods, Both arms upon the knees: 'tis time that all Should imitate this posture. Octavius. We will close The gates of Janus. Mecænas. Janus looks both ways; He may like best the breezy air abroad And knock too hard against the bolted brass. Octavius (to a Guard). Call Gallus hither. Gallus. Cæsar! what commands? Octavius. I would entrust a legion, more than one, To our friend Gallus: I would fix him here In Egypt: none is abler to coerce The turbulent. Gallus. Let others flap their limbs With lotus-leaves when Sirius flames above, Give me the banks of Anio, where young Spring, Who knows not half the names of her own flowers, Looks into Summer's eyes and wakes him up Alert, and laughs at him until he lifts His rod of roses and she runs away. Octavius. And has that lovely queen no charms for thee? Gallus. If truth be spoken of her, and it may, Since she is powerless and deserted now, Tho' more than thrice seven years have come and stolen Day after day a leaf or two of bloom, She has but changed her beauty; the soft tears Fall, one would think, to make it spring afresh. Octavius. And not for Gallus? Let one brave man more Ascend the footstool of the regal bed. Gallus. As the Gods will! but may they not will me! SCENE THE SIXTH. Antony and Dolabella. Antony. Welcome, my Dolabella! There is none From yonder camp I would embrace beside. My little queen hath given at last an audience To thy persuasive tongue? Dolabella. Most graciously. Antony. I never thought she would permit Cæsarion To leave her side; hardly can I myself Bear separation from that brave young boy; I love him as my own. Dolabella. Your own thus stand Safe from all peril. Antony. Is not it disgrace? A boy save me? for to save them is me. Dolabella. Create a generosity of soul In one whom conquest now hath made secure; Bid him put forth his power, it now is greater Than any man's: consider what a friend Cæsarion hath in Julius, all whose wounds Will bleed afresh before the assembled tribes On the imperial robe thy hands outsprad With its wide rents for every God above And every Roman upon earth to number. Antony. Ah! those were days worth living o'er again. Dolabella. Live them again then. Antony. Never, stript of power, Of dignity, of Rome's respect, of theirs Who compass me, who fix before these eyes The very eagles which adorn'd my tent. Dolabella. Brave thoughts! but are none weaker intermixt? Antony. Smile, Dolabella! Oh, could but that smile Kill as it pierces me! But tread the ground Softly and lightly where her feet have moved. My Cleopatra! never will we part, Thy son shall reign in Egypt. Dolabella. Much I fear'd, O Antony, thy rancour might prevail Against thy prudence. Cæsar bears no rancour. Antony. Too little is that heart for honest hatred. The serpent the most venomous hath just Enough of venom for one deadly wound, He strikes but once, and then he glides away. Dolabella. Octavius strikes not Antony. Antony. One man Alone dares strike the man whom thou hast named. But let me hear the phrase of fraudulence. Dolabella. Cæsar's, I trust, will not deserve that name, He says his reign shall be the reign of peace. Antony. Peace! what is that? a pleasant room to sit Or walk about in, nor could heart desire A cooler place wherein to spread the cates: First, bring these cates; bring liberty, the salt That seasons with true relish all things else. Dolabella. We sometimes leave but little, when we rise From its enjoyment, for those servitors Who toil'd for us throughout the heat of day: Reckless we riot: never can spilt wine Enter the golden cup it sparkled in: Harpies above defile the half-eaten fruit. Rome now would rest awhile. Antony. Yea, long will be Her rest: the scourge of Earth will be the scorn. Dolabella. We must submit. Antony. Thou must; thou hast submitted; But never I; what I have been I am. Dolabella. Less prosperous than once, thy fortunes may Be yet restored. Antony. I would not take them back, By any man, least by that man, bestow'd; I would not have my portion of the world, No, nor the whole of it, if that glib tongue Call'd every God to ratify the gift. Show me the foe he ever fairly met, The friend he hath embraced, and not betray'd, And tell me, Dolabella, for thou canst, Who murder'd Hirtius; by whose agency Poison was dropt into the wound of Pansa. Dolabella. Of this ask Glyco, ask Aquilius Niger Of that. Antony. Both know the secret, both have told it: And now I will tell thee one. At the noon Of yesterday, when fruit is most refreshing, A countryman who brings the yellow figs His queen is fond of, brought a basketful, Saying to Iras: “These my little daughter, Whom once you used to play with in the garden, Bids me to give into your hands; she thinks The queen requires some frolic; you alone Can venture so far with her. Place within The smooth cool linen of her bed this basket Of cane-leaves and of rushes intertwined, With all the fruit below, the leaves a-top; You see it is but shallow, scarce a palm, Mind it lie flat; yet she will find it out Tho' it be always dusky in that room.” What is there in the tale that thou shouldst stare? Dolabella. Enough. An idle rumour reacht the camp That Cleopatra stung herself to death, Vexing two asps held close against her bosom. Antony. Are Romans all so ignorant of the asp That two are wanted? that he must be vext? That, like domestic animals, he bites? He bites not, but he strikes with upper jaw As other vipers do, and the black lid Drops, and he crawls away; one pang, one shriek, Death hears it, nor delays: the hind knows that. An earlier story now. So exquisite In luxury, my queen dissolved a pearl Above all price, and drank it in her wine. Bid thou the tatler of the tale expound How that same acid which dissolved the pearl Darken'd no tooth, abbreviated no smile, But gave her spirits for the festive song. Ah! had she done so, Medicine had run up In vain to help her; Death had interposed. Dolabella. Another tale, alike incredible. 'Tis said she shook from off her coronal Poison into your cup, dashing it down Just at the lip, and proving its effect On household beast before you, thus to show How easy were the deed to one who will'd. Antony. Is such a fiction workt by homespun yarn? I doubt it: surely some Greek needle wrought The quaint device, for poet to adorn By metaphor, and sage by apologue. Thou hast among thy friends one capable, In man's attire, fresh-blooming from Hymettus, Handmaid of Cilnius the rich Aretine. O Romans! are your ears to falsities Wide open, and your mouths agape for them As are the callow sparrows for their food, Hour after hour? Ye little know that asps Are not mere worms of one span-length, one cubit, But longer than the vipers in your fields, So hideous that no woman, young or old, Or rustic, or well train'd to monkey-gods, But must abhor them. Your credulity Will urge the whisper in each other's ear That she, the daintiest of all womankind, Would handle them, now plague them, now caress And hug them as she might a tender babe . . Yet even the serious may believe the tale, For what in Rome is not believed . . but truth? Dolabella. To me the queen said nothing of this snare. Antony. Nothing she knows of it. I heard a scream From Iras, and rusht in. She threw herself Before my feet, prayed me to strike her dead, And ran toward the corner, where I saw The beasts coil'd up, and cut them thro' and thro'. Then told she all; but not until her prayer For death was fruitless, not until I warn'd her How life and death, while yet we live, are ours. Dolabella. Might I advise . . Antony. Not me: I never took Any advice, in battle or debate: Dolabella. Cæsar hath urged thee sorely, and may worse; What wouldst thou do with him were he the vanquisht? Antony. Do with him? throw him to the fishermen To bait their hooks with and catch crocodiles, If crocodile feeds upon crocodile. Take him these words: we keep no secrets here. Dolabella. Cæsar is lenient. Antony. Never let that word Glide o'er thy lips, no word is it for me. Tell him no friend of mine shall ask my life, No enemy shall give it. I am lord Of my own honour; he has none to lose: The money-changer's grandson calculates But badly here. He waits for thee: depart. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Antony and Agrippa. Antony. And so, the victor comes to taunt the vanquisht! Is this well done, Agrippa? Agrippa. 'Twere ill done, And never done by me. There have been some Who carried to the forum and there cast The tags and rags of mimes, and tarnisht spangles Bag'd from the dusthole corner; gravity Becomes me better and plain Roman garb In action and in speech; no taunt is mine. Antony. What then demands the vanquisher? Agrippa. I come To ask a favour, ask a gift, of thee. Give me thy children. Antony. To adopt? Agrippa. To save: They may have enemies; they shall have friends If thou accedest to my last request: Lose we no time; we shall be soon at Rome. Antony. Ventidius may prevent it. Agrippa. He hath serv'd thee Faithfully, and is steady to thy cause: The sea is closed to him, the river closed, Wide as the desert is, it is not open, And half his army, more than half, is ours. Antony. But many yet are left me, brave and true. Agrippa. When Fortune hath deserted us, too late Comes Valour, standing us in little stead. They who would die for us are just the men We should not push on death or throw away. Antony. Too true! Octavius with his golden wand Hath reacht from far some who defied his sword. How little fire within warps loosen'd staves Together, for the hoop to hold them tight! I have too long stood balancing the world Not to know well its weight: of that frail crust Friends are the lightest atoms. Agrippa. Not so all. Antony. I thought of Dolabella and the rest. Ventidius and Agrippa, these are men Romulus might have wrestled with nor thrown. I have proved both. Agrippa. One thou shalt prove again, In guise more friendly than when last we met. Antony. To me well spoken hast thou for Ventidius, Speak for him in that manner to another, Tell him that he has done against the Parthian What Julius might, perhaps might not, have done. Triumph must follow. I shall never see it, Nor shall I see, nor shalt thou either, one On which cold eyes, dim even in youth to beauty, Look forward. Are there not kings left enow To drag, by brace or leash, and back to back, Along the Sacred Way? Vile wretch! his steeds Shall never at the cries of Cleopatra Prance up against their trappings stiff with gold. Agrippa. Sad were the sight. Antony. Too far hath Dolabella Prevail'd with her. Agrippa. Hath Dolabella come Within these walls? Antony. Hast thou not seen him then Leave them within the hour? Agrippa. Indeed not I. My station is the harbour where the ships Are riding, his lies nearer to the town. Thou musest, Antony! Antony. And well may muse. He was my friend . . is he. Away with doubt! Agrippa. He was the friend of Tullius, friend of Brutus, Friend too of Lepidus, akin to each, And yet betraid he them. Give me the boys; With me they enter Rome. Antony. Take, take them; both? Yes; both are safer, both are happier so. I love them; but I might have loved them more; Now is too late. Take them; be kind to them . . Nay, look not back. Tears scorch the father's eyes, The Roman should extinguish them . . and shall. Farewell! Farewell! But turn thy face aside . . No . . one word more. Agrippa. Thy gladness gladdens me, Bursting so suddenly. What happy change! Antony. Thou hast a little daughter, my old friend, And I two little sons . . I had at least . . Give her the better and the braver one, When by thy care he comes to riper age. Agrippa. O Antony! the changes of our earth Are suddener and oftener than the moon's. On hers we calculate, not so on ours, But leave them in the hands of wilful Gods, Inflexible, yet sometimes not malign. Antony. They have done much for me, nor shall reproach Against them pass my lips: I might have askt, But never thought of asking, what desert Was mine for half the blessings they bestow'd. I will not question them why they have cast My greatness and my happiness so low; They have not taken from me their best gift, A heart for ever open to my friends: It will be cold ere long, and one will grieve. SCENE THE EIGHTH. Octavius, Agrippa, Cæsarion, Mecænas. Octavius. What said that obstinate and proud old thief? Couldst thou not draw him from his den, Agrippa? Agrippa. I tried not. Octavius. Nor perhaps desired. Agrippa. 'Tis true, I entered not by stealth, and broke no confidence; Tatius, who knew and once fought under me . . Octavius. And would not he who knows thy power, and who Admitted thee within the royal hold, Do more? Agrippa. Not even this would he have done For any other, nor for me without Permission from his general; this obtain'd, I enter'd. Octavius. His audacity, no doubt, Abated with his fortunes, and he droopt As droops a lotus when the water fails. Agrippa. Neither in life nor death will that man droop; He holds down Fortune, still too strong for her. Octavius. We must then starve him out, or slay his sons, Before his eyes. Agrippa. Thus nothing will remain For him to fear, and every honest sword Will skulk within its scabbard for mere shame. This may not be the worst . . when brave men fall By treachery, men like them avenge the blow; Antonius did it . . was Antonius blamed? Octavius. But who will answer for our own dear lives If these boys live? Agrippa. I will . . the boys are mine. Octavius. Cæsarion is secure. Agrippa. I do rejoice At this. Octavius. I wonder he hath not arrived. Agrippa. Rescued from Egypt is the Roman lad? I long to see him. Octavius. Wait then, and thou shalt. Agrippa. Women and eunuchs and Greek parasites Educate ill those who may one day rule. Octavius. True, very true . . we will bear this in mind. Agrippa. He must learn better soon. Octavius. Be sure he shall. Agrippa. What are those sistrums and those tamborines That trifle with the trumpet and intrude? Octavius. The very things that thou wouldst provide against. Heigh! who commanded such obstreperous shouts? Agrippa. The man who gave us Egypt, sir, and thee. The sound bursts louder from his hollow tomb: Such are the honours which attend his child. Octavius. Hark! the arms strike the ground! Agrippa. Soldiers, well done! Already do they know whom they salute. Cæsarion. Hail! hail! my cousin! Let me kiss that hand So soft and white. Why hold it back from me? I am your cousin, boy Cæsarion. Octavius. Who taught you all this courtesy? Cæsarion. My heart. Beside, my mother bade me wish you joy. Octavius. I would myself receive it from her. Cæsarion. Come, Come then with me; none see her and are sad. Octavius. Then she herself is not so? Cæsarion. Not a whit, Grave as she looks, but should be merrier still. Octavius. She may expect all bounty at our hands. Cæsarion. Bounty! she wants no bounty. Look around; Those palaces, those temples, and their gods And myriad priests within them, all are hers; And people bring her ships, and gems, and gold. O cousin! do you know what some men say, (If they do say it) that your sails ere long Will waft all these away? I wish 'twere true What else they talk. Octavius. What is it? Cæsarion. That you come To carry off her also. She is grown Paler, and I have seen her bite her lip At hearing this. Ha! well I know my mother; She thinks it may look redder for the bite. But will you really carry us to Rome In triumph? thro' the streets, and up the hill, And over arches . . foolish folks say under . . With flowers all round them? O! what joy to see The people that once loved my father so! Octavius. We will do all that may oblige the queen. Cæsarion. And yet she shudders at the very thought Of those fresh honours which delight my heart. Octavius. For her, or for yourself? Cæsarion. We boys, you know, Think of ourselves the first; and yet, and yet, If my sweet mother is averse to change, And weary of it, I would pass my days With her; yes, even in that lonely tower (Which to my eyes looks like a sepulchre) Whence she protests the Gods alone shall take her. Octavius (to a Guard). See due attention paid this royal guest. Cæsarion. Unwillingly I part from one so kind. Octavius (to Agrippa). Agrippa, didst thou mark that comely boy. Agrippa. I did indeed. Octavius. There is methinks in him A somewhat not unlike our common friend. Agrippa. Unlike? There never was such similar Expression. I remember Caius Julius In youth, altho' my elder by some years; Well I remember that high-vaulted brow, Those eyes of eagle under it, those lips At which the senate and the people stood Expectant for their portals to unclose; Then speech, not womanly but manly sweet, Came from them, and shed pleasure as the morn Sheds light. Octavius. The boy has too much confidence. Agrippa. Not for his prototype. When he threw back That hair in hue like cinnamon, I thought I saw great Julius tossing his, and warn The pirates he would give them their desert. My boy, thou gazest at those arms hung round. Cæsarion. I am not strong enough for sword and shield, Nor even so old as my sweet mother was When I first rioted upon her knee And seiz'd whatever sparkled in her hair. Ah! you had been delighted had you seen The pranks she pardon'd me. What gentleness! What playfulness! Octavius. Go now, Cæsarion. Cæsarion. And had you ever seen my father too! He was as fond of her as she of me, And often bent his thoughtful brow o'er mine To kiss what she had kist, then held me out To show how he could manage the refractory, Then one long smile, one pressure to the breast. Octavius. How tedious that boy grows! Lead him away, Aufidius! There is mischief in his mind, He looks so guileless. Agrippa. He has lived apart From evil counsellors, with grey-hair'd men Averse to strife, and maidens of the queen. Octavius. This makes me think . . We will another time Consider what is best. Here comes Mecænas. (To Mecænas.) Cilnius! you met upon the stairs that boy? Mecænas. I did. Octavius. What think you of him? Mecænas. At one glance 'Twere rashness to decide. Octavius. Seems he not proud? Mecænas. He smiled and past me by. Octavius. What insolence! quite insupportable! Mecænas. Perhaps he knew me not; and, if he knew me, I have no claim on affability From Cæsar's enemies. Agrippa (to himself). By Jove! the man At first so calm begins at last to chafe. O, the vain Tuscan of protuberant purse! Octavius. What said Agrippa? Agrippa. That our friend here chafes, Altho' the mildest of all mortal men. Octavius. Excepting one; one whom no wrongs can ruffle. I must give orders for some small affairs, And will rejoin you soon. Agrippa. My gentle Cilnius! Do save this lad! Octavius is so calm, I doubt he hath some evil in his breast Against the only scion of the house, The orphan child of Julius. Mecænas. Think, Agrippa, If there be safety where such scion is, Safety for you and me. Agrippa. The mother must Adorn the triumph, but that boy would push Rome, universal Rome, against the steeds That should in ignominy bear along The image of her Julius. Think; when Antony Show'd but his vesture, sprang there not tears, swords, Curses? and swept they not before them all Who shared the parricide? If such result Sprang from torn garment, what must from the sight Of that fresh image which calls back again The latest of the Gods, and not the least, Who nurtured every child within those walls, And emptied into every mother's lap Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, Gaul, And this inheritance of mighty kings. No such disgrace must fall on Cæsar's son. Spare but the boy, and we are friends for ever. Mecænas. Friends are we, but Octavius is our master. Agrippa. Let him brush kings away and blow off queens, But there are some of us who never struck At boys, nor trampled on a prostrate head; Some of us are there too who fain would see Rome better than they left her, with high blood Bounding along her veins; enough hath flowed. Mecænas. Here comes Octavius. We attend his will. Octavius. Enough that I know yours, my truest friends! I look into your hearts and find my own. Thy wishes, O Agrippa, I divine. Antony was thy comrade in the wars Of Julius; Fulvia was thy enemy And mine: her children to the Infernal Gods Devote I, but the born of Cleopatra Thou shalt have saved: Cæsarion shall rest here. SCENE THE NINTH. Dolabella. Cæsarion. Scopas. Dolabella. Where hast thou put Cæsarion? Scopas. Nigh at hand. Dolabella. What is he doing? Scopas. Just what lads like most; Munching a water-melon. There is good, At least good-nature, in that simple soul. While most were sleeping in the night of noon I brought him hither. Thirsty were we both, And wine I offer'd him: he pusht it by And said, “I drink no wine; bring water-melons.” I brought him one: he cut it fairly thro', And gave me half before he toucht the other, Saying, “but keep the seeds, the round and black, That I may plant them, when we get to Rome, With my own hands in garden all my own.” Dolabella. Poor innocent! Scopas. I could not help but smile. Dolabella. For once I envy thee. But call him in. Scopas. Ho! youngster! here! Cæsarion. What means that loud rude speech? This man seems civiler; I may converse With him, but never more, thou churl, with thee. Dolabella. I would, my fair young friend, his voice less rough, But honest Romans are sometimes abrupt. Scopas is sorry. Cæsarion. Honest! sorry too! I then was wrong, and am more vext than he. Scopas. Boy! I could wish I never saw thy face Nor heard thy tongue. Cæsarion. What can he mean? Dolabella. He feels The offence he gave. Cæsarion. Good man, be comforted, And let my hand atone for face and tongue. Scopas (to Dolabella). That smile disarms me. Dolabella. My sweet prince, observe How he repents. I have some words to speak In private to him: but I first would hear How fare your little brothers. Cæsarion. They are gone, Both gone: two maidens carried them away Before a noble-looking man they call Agrippa. Dolabella. Gone? say you? and with Agrippa? O that I could have seen them ere they went! Cæsarion. No matter; I will tell you all about them, It is not much, if you desire to know. One can not talk, the other talks all day, One smiles at me, the other pulls my hair, But he smiles too, and then runs off as fleet As my gazelle, yet easier to be caught. You have heard all, and now will I return And leave you, as you wish: I know my way. Dolabella. The duty must be done; 'tis Cæsar's will. Scopas. Then done it shall be. Dolabella. Take this token: here; Take this too; ninety golden of like weight Lie in the leather. Scopas. Thanks; the deed is done. [Alone.] What do these letters, bright and sharp, denote? Cæsar Dictator; and what else beneath? Perpetuo. Gods above! Perpetuo too! Ashes may be perpetual: nothing more Remains of our dictator. Take the urn, Empty it, weigh it inwards: poise the two, This inch-broad coin with it; and what I toss On my forefinger is the solider I must go in. Cæsarion. 'Tis very kind in you To visit me again: you bear no malice. I know at once who loves me. Scopas. And do I? Cæsarion. One moment yes, one moment no. My handsome And gentle cousin does not love me quite; I wish he did, I want so to love him. How cool and quiet is this small dim room! It wants no cushion: I begin to think The hard stone-seat refreshes more the limbs. Will you not try? Scopas. Not yet; but presently. Cæsarion. My mother is not here; you need not mind. People must not sit down before a queen; But before boys, whatever boys they are, Men may, and should. Oh! what can I have done? And did you strike me? Would you strike again? What runs into my sandals from my breast? Oh! it begins to pain me . . sadly, sadly! Scopas. By all the Gods and Goddesses above! I have no strength to strike the boy again. Cæsarion. O father! father! where is now that face So gravely fond that bent o'er your Cæsarion? And, mother! thou too gone! In all this gloom Where shall I find thee? Scopas! Scopas! help! Scopas. Away with me! Where is the door? Against it Stands he? or follows he? Crazed! I am crazed! O had but he been furious! had he struck me! Struggled, or striven, or lookt despitefully! Anything, anything but call my name So tenderly. O had that mild reproach Of his been keener when his sense return'd, Only to leave him ever-lastingly, I might not have been, what I now am, frantic. Upturn'd to me those wandering orbs, outspred Those quivering arms, falling the last of him, And striking once, and only once, the floor, It shook my dagger to the very hilt, And ran like lightning up into my brain. SCENE THE TENTH. Eros and Antony. Antony. Eros! I speak thee welcome. Eros. Hail, our lord! Antony. Thou hast been ever faithful to thy trust, And spoken freely, but decorously, On what concern'd the household and the state. My glory is gone down, and life is cold Without it. I have known two honest men Among the senators and consulars . . Eros. None among humbler? Antony. By the Powers above! I thought but of the powerful, men of birth. Eros. All men are that. Some sink below their cradle, Others rise higher than parental roof, And want no sceptre to support their steps. Antony. Such there may be whom we have all past by. Eros. Men cast long shadows when their life declines, Which we cross over without noticing; We met them in the street and gave not way, When they were gone we lifted up both hands, And said to neighbours These were men indeed! Antony. Reflections such as thine had wearied me Erewhile, and from another even now; But what is that thou bringest me wrapt up, Tardy in offering it as worth too little? Eros. I bring a ruby and a hollow ring Whereon it fitted. Antony. Gods of Rome! at last Ye make me grateful. Thanks, and thanks alone, Have I to give, and one small sacrifice; I vow it you before this hour is past. My heart may beat against its bars awhile, But shall not leave me yet. Go, Eros, go, I must lie down and rest, feeble and faint. But come back presently. Eros (after some absence). How fares our lord? Antony. Recovered, sound again, more sound than ever. Eros. And yet our lord looks more like other men. Antony (smiling). We can not always swagger, always act A character the wise will never learn: When Night goes down, and the young Day resumes His pointed shafts, and chill air breathes around, Then we put on our own habiliments And leave the dusty stage we proudly trod. I have been sitting longer at life's feast Than does me good; I will arise and go. Philosophy would flatten her thin palm Outspread upon my sleeve; away with her! Cuff off, cuff out, that chattering toothless jade! The brain she puzzles, and she blunts the sword: Even she knows better words than that word live. Cold Cato, colder Brutus, guide not me; No, nor brave Cassius. Thou hast brought me balm. Eros. Our lord may have some message for the giver, Which will console her. Antony. She expected none: I did; and it is come. Say, lookt she pale? Spake she no word? Eros. Alas, most noble sir, She would not see me. Charmian said her face Was indeed pale, yet grew less pale than usual After she gave the ring, and then she spake Amid some sighs (some spasms too interposed) More cheerfully, and said she fain would sleep. Antony. The fondest heart, the truest, beats no more. She listened to me, she hath answered me, She wanted no entreaty, she obeyed, She now commands: but no command want I. Queen of my soul! I follow in thy train, Thine is the triumph. Eros, up! rejoice! Tears, man! do tears become us at this hour? I never had too many; thou hast seen (If thou didst see) the last of them. My sword! I will march out becomingly. Eros. O sir! Enemies watch all round, and famine waits Within. Antony. Thou knowest not the prudent sons Of Egypt; corn and wine have been supplied Enough for many years, piled underground. Tho' stiffened by the sludge of barbarism, Or indolent and overgorged at home, Briton or German would take heed that none Who fought for him should perish for the lack Of sustenance: the timid bird herself Will hover round and round until she bring The grain cried out for in the helpless nest. Give me my sword! Is the point sharp? Eros. In vain To trust it now! Antony. Come, bring it; let me try it. Eros. O heavens and earth! Help! help! no help is nigh, No duty left but one: less worthily Than willingly this duty I perform. [Stabs himself. It pains not: for that blood I see no more. SCENE THE ELEVENTH. Officer. Octavius. Mecænas. Gallus. Officer. News! glorious news! news certain! Dead as Death! Octavius. Who dead? Officer. The master of the horse to Julius, Master too, but this morning, of this realm, The great . . Mecænas. Halt there! and know, where Cæsar is There is none great but Cæsar! Officer. Pardon! true! Octavius. And nought about his paramour? Officer. The queen? Octavius. Yes, fellow, yes. Officer. Surely our emperor knows Of her; the story now is some days old. The queen was poisoned by two little worms Which people here call asps, most venomous things, Coil'd in a yellow fig around the seeds. Her maidens wail'd her loudly; men and maidens Alike mourn'd over . . I had nearly slipt. Octavius. Many have done the same. Art thou a Roman? Officer. I have the honour, sir, to be a Gaul, A native of Massilia, that famed city Inhabited by heroes, built by Gods, Who entered it again with Caius Julius. Mecænas. And didst thou see them enter? Officer. Not distinctly, There were a few between: one told it me Who saw them; which, ye know, is just the same. Octavius. Retire, my brave! go sure of a reward. Lucretia hath escaped us after all! But there is wax in Egypt, there are Greeks Who model it, and who can bear to look On queen or asp; this model'd to the life, The other more like what they work upon. No trouble in thus carrying her to Rome. Gallus! thou lookest grave: thou art the man Exactly to compose an epitaph. No matter which died first: I think the asps Rather have had the start: I may be wrong, A bad chronologist, a worse astrologer. Mecænas. Where Cæsar smiles, all others smile but Gallus, Gallus. Not even Cæsar's smiles awaken mine When every enemy has dropt away, And he who made so many safe, is safe. Mecænas. I wish thou wert more joyous. Gallus. Kind the wish, Almost enough to make me so. Mecænas. Come! Come! I know you poets: any wager now Thou hast already forced the weeping Muse To thy embraces. Tell us honestly; Hast thou not turn'd the egg upon the nest Ready for hatching? Octavius. Guilty; look at him, He blushes, blushes from cheekbone to beard. Now, Gallus, for the epitaph. Mecænas. Recite it. Gallus. Epitaphs are but cold and chisel'd words, Or mostly false if warmer: quite unfit Are mine for marble or for memory. I thought of her . . another would have said He wept: I wept not, but I know I sigh'd. Mecænas. And wrote? For poet is half sigh half flame: Sigh out thy sigh. Gallus. Would Cæsar hear it? Octavius. Yea. Gallus. I have not ventured to pronounce the name Of her I meditated on. Cæsar. My friend Is here judicious as in all things else. Gallus. “Thou hast been floating on the o'erswollen stream Of life these many summers; is thy last Now over? hast thou dreamt out every dream? Hath horn funereal blown the pageant past? Cæsar! thou too must follow: all the rods Of sternest lictor cannot scare off Death; She claims the earth for heritage; our Gods Themselves have seen their children yield their breath.” Cæsar. Gallus! I always thought thee a brave soldier, Never a first-rate poet: I am right. Gallus. Cæsar! I never heard of one who gain'd A battle and a kingdom who was not. Cæsar. If there be anything on earth I know Better than other things, 'tis poetry. Mecænas. My sweet Octavius! draw not under nose The knuckle of forefinger. Gallus aim'd A harmless arrow: Love in sport hath done it Often and often. Gallus, seize his hand. Now sing a pæan; sing a prophet's; sing Egypt! thy pyramid of power is closed. Gallus. I would; but want the breath: I have but strength For elegy: here is the last of mine. “The mighty of the earth are earth, A passing gleam the brightest smile, In golden beds have sorrows birth, Alas! these live the longer while.” Octavius. Unless we haste to supper, we shall soon Forfeit our appetites. Come, my two friends! SCENE THE TWELFTH. Octavius and Octavia. Octavius. Embrace me, sister; we have won; thy wrongs Are now avenged. Octavia. Speak not of wrong, but right, And bring Rome peace and happiness once more. 'Tis kind in thee (but thou wert always kind) To come so soon to greet me, while the altar Is warm and damp with incense for thy safety. Octavius. Octavia! I have brought thee from the Nile Two pretty little serpents. Octavia. Of all beasts The serpent is the beast I most abhor. Take them away. Octavius. I have not brought them here, Be not afraid; beside, they are so young They can not bite. Octavia. But send them off. Octavius. I will. What thinkest thou are these two reptiles call'd? Octavia. I know not, nor can guess. Octavius. Lucius and Marcus, The brood of Antony. O Heaven! she faints! Rise, sister! let me help thee up; be sure They shall not hurt thee. Grasp not thus my wrist, And shoot not up those leaden bolts at me, For such are thy stiff eyes. I said, and swear, The little monsters never shall hurt thee. I do not like those tears; but better they Than the cold flint they fall from, and now melt. Octavia. Brother, I know thy purpose. On my knees . . Octavius. Arise! There wants not this to seal their doom. Octavia. This is my fault, not theirs, if fault there be. Octavius. I want, and I will have, security. Octavia. What is there now on earth to apprehend? Octavius. I dread lest he who guards them should adopt. Octavia. Let him! O let him! if an honest man. Frown not, debate not, struggle not against Thy better Genius; argue with him thus, “Octavius! has there not been blood enough Without the blood of children?” Octavius. Is my safety Not dear to thee? Octavia. Thy glory, thy content, Are . . no, not dearer, but almost as dear. Hast thou not suffer'd pangs at every head That fell? Octavius. They fell that mine might not. Octavia. But children Strike not so high. Octavius. Are children always children? Octavia. O brother, brother! are men always men? They are full-grown then only when grown up Above their fears. Power never yet stood safe; Compass it round with friends and kindnesses, And not with moats of blood. Remember Thebes: The towers of Cadmus toppled, split asunder, Crasht: in the shadow of her oleanders The pure and placid Dirce still flows by. What shatter'd to its base but cruelty, (Mother of crimes, all lesser than herself) The house of Agamemnon king of kings? Octavius. Thou art not yet, Octavia, an old woman; Tell not, I do beseech thee, such old tales. Octavia. Hear later; hear what our own parents saw. Where lies the seed of Sulla? Could the walls Of his Præneste shelter the young Marius, Or subterranean passages provide Escape? he stumbled through the gore his father Had left in swamps on our Italian plains. We have been taught these histories together, Neither untrue nor profitless; few years Have since gone by, can memory too have gone? Ay, smile, Octavius! only let the smile Be somewhat less disdainful. Octavius. 'Tis unwise To plant thy foot where Fortune's wheel runs on. Octavia. I lack not wisdom utterly; my soul Assures me wisdom is humanity, And they who want it, wise as they may seem, And confident in their own sight and strength, Reach not the scope they aim at. Worst of war Is war of passion; best of peace is peace Of mind, reposing on the watchful care Daily and nightly of the household Gods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND VOLUME POEMS AND EPIGRAMS. GEBIR. FIRST BOOK. I sing the fates of Gebir. He had dwelt Among those mountain-caverns which retain His labours yet, vast halls and flowing wells, Nor have forgotten their old master's name Though sever'd from his people: here, incenst By meditating on primeval wrongs, He blew his battle-horn, at which uprose Whole nations; here, ten thousand of most might He call'd aloud; and soon Charoba saw His dark helm hover o'er the land of Nile. What should the virgin do? should royal knees Bend suppliant? or defenceless hands engage Men of gigantic force, gigantic arms? For 'twas reported that nor sword sufficed, Nor shield immense nor coat of massive mail, But that upon their towering heads they bore Each a huge stone, refulgent as the stars. This told she Dalica, then cried aloud, “If on your bosom laying down my head I sobb'd away the sorrows of a child, If I have always, and Heav'n knows I have, Next to a mother's held a nurse's name, Succour this one distress, recall those days, Love me, tho' 'twere because you lov'd me then.” But whether confident in magic rites Or toucht with sexual pride to stand implor'd, Dalica smiled, then spake: “Away those fears. Though stronger than the strongest of his kind, He falls; on me devolve that charge; he falls. Rather than fly him, stoop thou to allure; Nay, journey to his tents. A city stood Upon that coast, they say, by Sidad built, Whose father Gad built Gadir; on this ground Perhaps he sees an ample room for war. Persuade him to restore the walls himself In honour of his ancestors, persuade . . But wherefore this advice? young, unespoused, Charoba want persuasions! and a queen!” “O Dalica!” the shuddering maid exclaim'd, “Could I encounter that fierce frightful man? Could I speak? no, nor sigh.” “And canst thou reign?” Cried Dalica; “Yield empire or comply.” Unfixt, though seeming fixt, her eyes downcast, The wonted buzz and bustle of the court From far through sculptured galleries met her ear; Then lifting up her head, the evening sun Pour'd a fresh splendour on her burnisht throne: The fair Charoba, the young queen, complied. But Gebir, when he heard of her approach, Laid by his orbed shield; his vizor-helm, His buckler and his corset he laid by, And bade that none attend him: at his side Two faithful dogs that urge the silent course, Shaggy, deep-chested, croucht; the crocodile, Crying, oft made them raise their flaccid ears And push their heads within their master's hand. There was a brightening paleness in his face, Such as Diana rising o'er the rocks Shower'd on the lonely Latmian; on his brow Sorrow there was, yet nought was there severe. But when the royal damsel first he saw, Faint, hanging on her hand-maid, and her knees Tottering, as from the motion of the car, His eyes lookt earnest on her, and those eyes Show'd, if they had not, that they might have, lov'd, For there was pity in them at that hour. With gentle speech, and more with gentle looks, He sooth'd her; but lest Pity go beyond And crost Ambition lose her lofty aim, Bending, he kist her garment, and retired. He went, nor slumber'd in the sultry noon, When viands, couches, generous wines, persuade, And slumber most refreshes; nor at night, When heavy dews are laden with disease; And blindness waits not there for lingering age. Ere morning dawn'd behind him, he arrived At those rich meadows where young Tamar fed The royal flocks entrusted to his care. “Now,” said he to himself, “will I repose At least this burthen on a brother's breast.” His brother stood before him: he, amazed, Rear'd suddenly his head, and thus began. “Is it thou, brother! Tamar, is it thou! Why, standing on the valley's utmost verge, Lookest thou on that dull and dreary shore Where beyond sight Nile blackens all the sand? And why that sadness? When I past our sheep The dew-drops were not shaken off the bar, Therefore if one be wanting, 'tis untold.” “Yes, one is wanting, nor is that untold,” Said Tamar; “and this dull and dreary shore Is neither dull nor dreary at all hours.” Whereon the tear stole silent down his cheek, Silent, but not by Gebir unobserv'd: Wondering he gazed awhile, and pitying spake. “Let me approach thee; does the morning light Scatter this wan suffusion o'er thy brow, This faint blue lustre under both thine eyes?” “O brother, is this pity or reproach?” Cried Tamar, “cruel if it be reproach, If pity, O how vain!” “Whate'er it be That grieves thee, I will pity, thou but speak, And I can tell thee, Tamer, pang for pang.” “Gebir! then more than brothers are we now! Everything (take my hand) will I confess. I neither feed the flock nor watch the fold; How can I, lost in love? But, Gebir, why That anger which has risen to your cheek? Can other men? could you? what, no reply! And still more anger, and still worse conceal'd! Are these your promises? your pity this?” “Tamar, I well may pity what I feel . . Mark me aright . . I feel for thee . . proceed . . Relate me all.” “Then will I all relate,” Said the young shepherd, gladden'd from his heart. “'Twas evening, though not sunset, and the tide Level with these green meadows, seem'd yet higher: 'Twas pleasant; and I loosen'd from my neck The pipe you gave me, and began to play. O that I ne'er had learnt the tuneful art! It always brings us enemies or love. Well, I was playing, when above the waves Some swimmer's head methought I saw ascend; I, sitting still, survey'd it, with my pipe Awkwardly held before my lips half-closed. Gebir! it was a Nymph! a Nymph divine! I can not wait describing how she came, How I was sitting, how she first assum'd The sailor; of what happen'd there remains Enough to say, and too much to forget. The sweet deceiver stept upon this bank Before I was aware; for with surprise Moments fly rapid as with love itself. Stooping to tune afresh the hoarsen'd reed, I heard a rustling, and where that arose My glance first lighted on her nimble feet. Her feet resembled those long shells explored By him who to befriend his steed's dim sight Would blow the pungent powder in the eye. Her eyes too! O immortal Gods! her eyes Resembled . . what could they resemble? what Ever resemble those? Even her attire Was not of wonted woof nor vulgar art: Her mantle show'd the yellow samphire-pod, Her girdle the dove-colour'd wave serene. ‘Shepherd,’ said she, ‘and will you wrestle now, And with the sailor's hardier race engage?’ I was rejoiced to hear it, and contrived How to keep up contention: could I fail By pressing not too strongly, yet to press? ‘Whether a shepherd, as indeed you seem, Or whether of the hardier race you boast, I am not daunted; no; I will engage.’ ‘But first,’ said she, ‘what wager will you lay?’ ‘A sheep,’ I answered: ‘add whate'er you will.’ ‘I can not,’ she replied, ‘make that return: Our hided vessels in their pitchy round Seldom, unless from rapine, hold a sheep. But I have sinuous shells of pearly hue Within, and they that lustre have imbibed In the sun's palace-porch, where when unyoked His chariot-wheel stands midway in the wave: Shake one and it awakens, then apply Its polisht lips to your attentive ear, And it remembers its august abodes, And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there. And I have others given me by the nymphs, Of sweeter sound than any pipe you have; But we, by Neptune! for no pipe contend, This time a sheep I win, a pipe the next.’ Now came she forward eager to engage, But first her dress, her bosom then survey'd, And heav'd it, doubting if she could deceive. Her bosom seem'd, inclos'd in haze like heav'n, To baffle touch, and rose forth undefined: Above her knee she drew the robe succinct, Above her breast, and just below her arms. ‘This will preserve my breath when tightly bound, If struggle and equal strength should so constrain.’ Thus, pulling hard to fasten it, she spake, And, rushing at me, closed: I thrill'd throughout And seem'd to lessen and shrink up with cold. Again with violent impulse gusht my blood, And hearing nought external, thus absorb'd, I heard it, rushing through each turbid vein, Shake my unsteady swimming sight in air. Yet with unyielding though uncertain arms I clung around her neck; the vest beneath Rustled against our slippery limbs entwined: Often mine springing with eluded force Started aside and trembled till replaced: And when I most succeeded, as I thought, My bosom and my throat felt so comprest That life was almost quivering on my lips, Yet nothing was there painful: these are signs Of secret arts and not of human might; What arts I can not tell; I only know My eyes grew dizzy and my strength decay'd; I was indeed o'ercome . . with what regret, And more, with what confusion, when I reacht The fold, and yielding up the sheep, she cried, ‘This pays a shepherd to a conquering maid.’ She smiled, and more of pleasure than disdain Was in her dimpled chin and liberal lip, And eyes that languisht, lengthening, just like love. She went away; I on the wicker gate Leant, and could follow with my eyes alone. The sheep she carried easy as a cloak; But when I heard its bleating, as I did, And saw, she hastening on, its hinder feet Struggle, and from her snowy shoulder slip, One shoulder its poor efforts had unveil'd, Then all my passions mingling fell in tears; Restless then ran I to the highest ground To watch her; she was gone; gone down the tide; And the long moon-beam on the hard wet sand Lay like a jasper column half up-rear'd.” “But, Tamar! tell me, will she not return?” “She will return, yet not before the moon Again is at the full: she promist this, Tho' when she promist I could not reply.” “By all the Gods I pity thee! go on, Fear not my anger, look not on my shame, For when a lover only hears of love He finds his folly out, and is ashamed. Away with watchful nights and lonely days, Contempt of earth and aspect up to heaven, With contemplation, with humility, A tatter'd cloak that pride wears when deform'd, Away with all that hides me from myself, Parts me from others, whispers I am wise: From our own wisdom less is to be reapt Than from the barest folly of our friend. Tamar! thy pastures, large and rich, afford Flowers to thy bees and herbage to thy sheep, But, battened on too much, the poorest croft Of thy poor neighbour yields what thine denies.” They hasten'd to the camp, and Gebir there Resolved his native country to forego, And order'd from those ruins to the right They forthwith raise a city. Tamar heard With wonder, tho' in passing, 'twas half-told, His brother's love, and sigh'd upon his own. SECOND BOOK. The Gadite men the royal charge obey. Now fragments weigh'd up from the uneven streets Leave the ground black beneath; again the sun Shines into what were porches, and on steps Once warm with frequentation; clients, friends, All morning, satchel'd idlers all mid-day, Lying half-up and languid tho' at games. Some raise the painted pavement, some on wheels Draw slow its laminous length, some intersperse Salt water thro' the sordid heaps, and seize The flowers and figures starting fresh to view; Others rub hard large masses, and essay To polish into white what they misdeem The growing green of many trackless years. Far off at intervals the axe resounds With regular strong stroke, and nearer home Dull falls the mallet with long labour fringed. Here arches are discover'd; there huge beams Resist the hatchet, but in fresher air Soon drop away: there spreads a marble squared And smoothen'd; some high pillar for its base Chose it, which now lies ruin'd in the dust. Clearing the soil at bottom, they espy A crevice, and, intent on treasure, strive Strenuous and groan to move it: one exclaims, “I hear the rusty metal grate; it moves!” Now, overturning it, backward they start, And stop again, and see a serpent pant, See his throat thicken and the crisped scales Rise ruffled, while upon the middle fold He keeps his wary head and blinking eye Curling more close, and crouching ere he strike. Go, mighty men, invade far cities, go, And be such treasure portions to your heirs. Six days they labour'd: on the seventh day Returning, all their labours were destroy'd. 'Twas not by mortal hand, or from their tents 'Twere visible; for these were now removed Above, where neither noxious mist ascends Nor the way wearies ere the work begin. There Gebir, pierced with sorrow, spake these words: “Ye men of Gades, arm'd with brazen shields, And ye of near Tartessus, where the shore Stoops to receive the tribute which all owe To Bœtis and his banks for their attire, Ye too whom Durius bore on level meads, Inherent in your hearts is bravery, For earth contains no nation where abounds The generous horse and not the warlike man. But neither soldier now nor steed avails, Nor steed nor soldier can oppose the Gods, Nor is there aught above like Jove himself, Nor weighs against his purpose, when once fixt, Aught but, with supplicating knee, the Prayers. Swifter than light are they, and every face, Tho' different, glows with beauty; at the throne Of Mercy, when clouds shut it from mankind, They fall bare-bosom'd, and indignant Jove Drops at the soothing sweetness of their voice The thunder from his hand. Let us arise On these high places daily, beat our breast, Prostrate ourselves and deprecate his wrath.” The people bow'd their bodies and obey'd. Nine mornings with white ashes on their heads Lamented they their toil each night o'erthrown, And now the largest orbit of the year, Leaning o'er black Mocattam's rubied brow, Proceeded slow, majestic, and serene, Now seemed not further than the nearest cliff, And crimson light struck soft the phosphor wave. Then Gebir spake to Tamar in these words: “Tamar! I am thy elder and thy king, But am thy brother too, nor ever said Give me thy secret and become my slave: But haste thee not away; I will myself Await the nymph, disguised in thy attire.” Then starting from attention, Tamar cried, “Brother! in sacred truth it can not be. My life is yours, my love must be my own. O surely he who seeks a second love Never felt one, or 'tis not one I feel.” But Gebir with complacent smile replied, “Go then, fond Tamar, go in happy hour, But, ere thou partest, ponder in thy breast And well bethink thee, lest thou part deceived, Will she disclose to thee the mysteries Of our calamity? and unconstrain'd? When even her love thy strength had to disclose. My heart indeed is full, but, witness heaven! My people, not my passion, fill my heart.” “Then let me kiss thy garment,” said the youth, “And heaven be with thee, and on me thy grace.” Him then the monarch thus once more addrest: “Be of good courage: hast thou yet forgot What chaplets languisht round thy unburnt hair, In colour like some tall smooth beech's leaves Curl'd by autumnal suns?” How flattery Excites a pleasant, soothes a painful shame! “These,” amid stifled blushes Tamar said, “Were of the flowering raspberry and vine: But ah! the seasons will not wait for love, Seek out some other now.” They parted here: And Gebir, bending through the woodland, cull'd The creeping vine and viscous raspberry, Less green and less compliant than they were, And twisted in those mossy tufts that grow On brakes of roses when the roses fade: And as he passes on, the little hinds That shake for bristly herds the foodful bough, Wonder, stand still, gaze, and trip satisfied; Pleas'd more if chesnut, out of prickly husk Shot from the sandal, roll along the glade. And thus unnoticed went he, and untired Stept up the acclivity; and as he stept, And as the garlands nodded o'er his brow, Sudden from under a close alder sprang Th' expectant nymph, and seiz'd him unaware. He stagger'd at the shock; his feet at first Slipt backward from the wither'd grass short-grazed, But striking out one arm, tho' without aim, Then grasping with his other, he enclosed The struggler; she gain'd not one step's retreat, Urging with open hands against his throat Intense, now holding in her breath constrain'd, Now pushing with quick impulse and by starts, Till the dust blacken'd upon every pore. Nearer he drew her and yet nearer, claspt Above the knees midway, and now one arm Fell, and her other lapsing o'er the neck Of Gebir, swung against his back incurved, The swoln veins glowing deep, and with a groan On his broad shoulder fell her face reclined. But ah! she knew not whom that roseate face Cool'd with its breath ambrosial; for she stood Higher on the bank, and often swept and broke His chaplets mingled with her loosen'd hair. Whether, while Tamar tarried, came desire, And she, grown languid, loost the wings of Love Which she before held proudly at her will, And, nought but Tamar in her soul, and nought (Where Tamar was) that seem'd or fear'd deceit, To fraud she yielded what no force had gain'd; Or whether Jove in pity to mankind, When from his crystal fount the visual orbs He fill'd with piercing ether, and endued With somewhat of omnipotence, ordain'd That never two fair forms at once torment The human heart and draw it different ways, And thus, in prowess like a god, the chief Subdued her strength nor softened at her charms, The nymph divine, the magic mistress, fail'd. Recovering, still half-resting on the turf, She lookt up wildly, and could now descry The kingly brow archt lofty for command. “Traitor!” said she undaunted, tho' amaze Threw o'er her varying cheek the air of fear, “Thinkest thou thus that with impunity Thou hast forsooth deceived me? dar'st thou deem Those eyes not hateful that have seen me fall? O heaven! soon may they close on my disgrace. Merciless man! what! for one sheep estranged Hast thou thrown into dungeons and of day Amerced thy shepherd? hast thou, while the iron Pierced thro' his tender limbs into his soul, By threats, by tortures, torn out that offence, And heard him (O could I) avow his love? Say, hast thou? cruel, hateful! ah my fears! I feel them true! speak, tell me, are they true?” She, blending thus entreaty with reproach, Bent forward, as tho' falling on her knee Whence she had hardly risen, and at this pause Shed from her large dark eyes a shower of tears. The Iberian King her sorrow thus consoled. “Weep no more, heavenly maiden, weep no more: Neither by force withheld nor choice estranged, Thy Tamar lives, and only lives for thee. Happy, thrice happy, you! 'tis me alone Whom heaven and earth and ocean with one hate Conspire on, and throughout each path pursue. Whether in waves beneath or skies above Thou hast thy habitation, 'tis from heaven, From heaven alone, such power, such charms descend. Then O! discover whence that ruin comes Each night upon our city; whence are heard Those yells of rapture round our fallen walls: In our affliction can the Gods delight, Or meet oblation for the Nymphs are tears?” He spake, and indignation sank in woe. Which she perceiving, pride refresht her heart, Hope wreath'd her mouth with smiles, and she exclaim'd: “Neither the Gods afflict you, nor the Nymphs. Return me him who won my heart, return Him whom my bosom pants for, as the steeds In the sun's chariot for the western wave. The Gods will prosper thee, and Tamar prove How Nymphs, the torments that they cause, assuage. Promise me this; indeed I think thou hast, But 'tis so pleasing, promise it once more.” “Once more I promise,” cried the gladden'd king, “By my right-hand and by myself I swear, And ocean's Gods and heaven's Gods I adjure, Thou shalt be Tamar's, Tamar shall be thine.” Then she, regarding him long fixt, replied: “I have thy promise, take thou my advice. Gebir! this land of Egypt is a land Of incantation, demons rule these waves; These are against thee, these thy works destroy. Where thou hast built thy palace, and hast left The seven pillars to remain in front, Sacrifice there, and all these rites observe. Go, but go early, ere the gladsome Hours Strew saffron in the path of rising Morn, Ere the bee buzzing o'er flowers fresh disclosed Examine where he may the best alight Nor scatter off the bloom, ere cold-lipt herds Crop the pale herbage round each other's bed, Lead seven bulls well pastur'd and well form'd, Their neck unblemisht and their horn unring'd, And at each pillar sacrifice thou one. Around each base rub thrice the blackening blood, And burn the curling shavings of the hoof, And of the forehead locks thou also burn; The yellow galls, with equal care preserv'd, Pour at the seventh statue from the north.” He listen'd, and on her his eyes intent Perceiv'd her not, and she had disappear'd; So deep he ponder'd her important words. And now had morn arisen and he perform'd Almost the whole enjoined him: he had reacht The seventh statue, pour'd the yellow galls, The forelock from his left he had releast, And burnt the curling shavings of the hoof Moisten'd with myrrh; when suddenly a flame Spired from the fragrant smoke, nor sooner spired Down sank the brazen fabric at his feet. He started back, gazed, nor could aught but gaze, And cold dread stiffen'd up his hair flower-twined; Then with a long and tacit step, one arm Behind, and every finger wide outspread, He lookt and totter'd on a black abyss. He thought he sometimes heard a distant voice Breathe thro' the cavern's mouth, and further on Faint murmurs now, now hollow groans reply. Therefore suspended he his crook above, Dropt it, and heard it rolling step by step: He enter'd, and a mingled sound arose Like one (when shaken from some temple's roof By zealous hand, they and their fretted nest) Of birds that wintering watch in Memnon's tomb, And tell the halcyons when spring first returns. THIRD BOOK. O for the spirit of that matchless man Whom Nature led throughout her whole domain, While he embodied breath'd ethereal air! Tho' panting in the play-hour of my youth I drank of Avon too, a dangerous draught, That rous'd within the feverish thirst of song, Yet never may I trespass o'er the stream Of jealous Acheron, nor alive descend The silent and unsearchable abodes Of Erebus and Night, nor unchastised Lead up long-absent heroes into day. When on the pausing theatre of earth Eve's shadowy curtain falls, can any man Bring back the far-off intercepted hills, Grasp the round rock-built turret, or arrest The glittering spires that pierce the brow of Heaven? Rather can any with outstripping voice The parting Sun's gigantic strides recall? Twice sounded Gebir! twice th' Iberian king Thought it the strong vibration of the brain That struck upon his ear; but now descried A form, a man, come nearer: as he came His unshorn hair (grown soft in these abodes) Waved back, and scatter'd thin and hoary light. Living men called him Aroar, but no more In celebration or recording verse His name is heard, no more by Arnon's side The well-wall'd city, which he rear'd, remains. Gebir was now undaunted, for the brave When they no longer doubt, no longer fear, And would have spoken, but the shade began. “Brave son of Hesperus! no mortal hand Has led thee hither, nor without the Gods Penetrate thy firm feet the vast profound. Thou knowest not that here thy fathers lie, The race of Sidad; theirs was loud acclaim When living, but their pleasure was in war; Triumphs and hatred followed: I myself Bore, men imagin'd, no inglorious part; The Gods thought otherwise, by whose decree Depriv'd of life, and more, of death depriv'd, I still hear shrieking thro' the moonless night Their discontented and deserted shades. Observe these horrid walls, this rueful waste! Here some refresh the vigour of the mind With contemplation and cold penitence. Nor wonder, while thou hearest, that the soul, Thus purified, hereafter may ascend Surmounting all obstruction, nor ascribe The sentence to indulgence; each extreme Hath tortures for ambition; to dissolve In everlasting languor, to resist Its impulse, but in vain; to be enclosed Within a limit, and that limit fire; Sever'd from happiness, from eminence, And flying, but hell bars us, from ourselves. Yet rather all these torments most endure Than solitary pain, and sad remorse, And towering thoughts on their own breast o'erturn'd And piercing to the heart: such penitence, Such contemplation theirs! thy ancestors Bear up against them, nor will they submit To conquering Time the asperities of Fate: Yet could they but revisit earth once more, How gladly would they poverty embrace, How labour, even for their deadliest foe! It little now avails them to have rais'd Beyond the Syrian regions, and beyond Phenicia, trophies, tributes, colonies: Follow thou me: mark what it all avails.” Him Gebir follow'd, and a roar confused Rose from a river rolling in its bed, Not rapid, that would rouse the wretched souls, Nor calmly, that might lull them to repose; But with dull weary lapses it upheaved Billows of bale, heard low, yet heard afar; For when hell's iron portals let out night, Often men start and shiver at the sound, And lie so silent on the restless couch, They hear their own hearts beat. Now Gebir breath'd Another air, another sky beheld: Twilight broods here, lull'd by no nightingale Nor waken'd by the shrill lark dewy-wing'd, But glowing with one sullen sunless heat. Beneath his foot nor sprouted flower nor herb, Nor chirpt a grasshopper; above his head Phlegethon form'd a fiery firmament; Part were sulphurous clouds involving, part Shining like solid ribs of molten brass; For the fierce element, which else aspires Higher and higher and lessens to the sky, Below, Earth's adamantine arch rebuft. Gebir, tho' now such languor held his limbs, Scarce aught admir'd he, yet he this admir'd; And thus addrest him then the conscious guide. “Beyond that river lie the happy fields; From them fly gentle breezes, which when drawn Against yon crescent convex, but unite Stronger with what they could not overcome. Thus they that scatter freshness thro' the groves And meadows of the fortunate, and fill With liquid light the marble bowl of Earth, And give her blooming health and sprightly force, Their fire no more diluted, nor its darts Blunted by passing thro' thick myrtle-bowers, Neither from odours rising half dissolved, Point forward Phlegethon's eternal flame; And this horizon is the spacious bow Whence each ray reaches to the world above.” The hero pausing, Gebir then besought What region held his ancestors, what clouds, What waters, or what Gods, from his embrace. Aroar then sudden, as tho' rous'd, renew'd. “Come thou, if ardour urges thee and force Suffices . . mark me, Gebir, I unfold No fable to allure thee . . on! behold Thy ancestors!” and lo! with horrid gasp The panting flame above his head recoil'd, And thunder through his heart and life-blood throb'd. Such sound could human organs once conceive, Cold, speechless, palsied, not the soothing voice Of friendship or almost of Deity Could raise the wretched mortal from the dust; Beyond man's home condition they! With eyes Intent, and voice desponding, and unheard By Aroar, tho' he tarried at his side, “They know me not,” cried Gebir, “O my sires, Ye know me not! they answer not, nor hear. How distant are they still! what sad extent Of desolation must we overcome! Aroar! what wretch that nearest us? what wretch Is that with eyebrows white and slanting brow? Listen! him yonder, who, bound down supine, Shrinks yelling from that sword there engine-hung; He too among my ancestors?” “O King! Iberia bore him, but the breed accurst Inclement winds blew blighting from north-east.” “He was a warrior then, nor fear'd the Gods?” “Gebir! he fear'd the Demons, not the Gods, Tho' them indeed his daily face adored, And was no warrior; yet the thousand lives Squander'd as stones to exercise a sling, And the tame cruelty and cold caprice . . Oh madness of mankind! addrest, adored! O Gebir! what are men? or where are Gods? Behold the giant next him, how his feet Plunge floundering mid the marshes yellow-flower'd, His restless head just reaching to the rocks, His bosom tossing with black weeds besmear'd, How writhes he 'twixt the continent and isle! What tyrant with more insolence e'er claim'd Dominion? when from the heart of Usury Rose more intense the pale-flamed thirst for gold? And call'd forsooth Deliverer! False or fools Who prais'd the dull-ear'd miscreant, or who hoped To soothe your folly and disgrace with praise! Hearest thou not the harp's gay simpering air And merriment afar? then come, advance; And now behold him! mark the wretch accurst Who sold his people to a rival king: Self-yoked they stood two ages unredeem'd.” “O horror! what pale visage rises there! Speak, Aroar! me perhaps mine eyes deceive, Inured not, yet methinks they there descry Such crimson haze as sometimes drowns the moon. What is yon awful sight? why thus appears That space between the purple and the crown?” “I will relate their stories when we reach Our confines,” said the guide; “for thou, O king, Differing in both from all thy countrymen, Seest not their stories and hast seen their fates. But while we tarry, lo again the flame Riseth, and murmuring hoarse, points straighter; haste, 'Tis urgent, we must hence.” “Then O adieu!” Cried Gebir and groan'd aloud: at last a tear Burst from his eyes turn'd back, and he exclaimed: “Am I deluded? O ye powers of hell! Suffer me . . O my fathers! am I torn . .” He spake, and would have spoken more, but flames Enwrapt him round and round intense; he turn'd And stood held breathless in a ghost's embrace. “Gebir! my son! desert me not! I heard Thy calling voice, nor fate withheld me more: One moment yet remains; enough to know Soon will my torments, soon will thine, expire. O that I e'er exacted such a vow! When dipping in the victim's blood thy hand, First thou withdrew'st it, looking in my face Wondering; but when the priest my will explain'd, Then swarest thou, repeating what he said, How against Egypt thou wouldst raise that hand And bruise the seed first risen from our line. Therefore in death what pangs have I endured! Rackt on the fiery centre of the sun, Twelve years I saw the ruin'd world roll round. Shudder not; I have borne it; I deserved My wretched fate; be better thine; farewell.” “O stay, my father! stay one moment more . . Let me return thee that embrace . . 'tis past . . Aroar! how could I quit it unreturn'd! And now the gulf divides us, and the waves Of sulphur bellow thro' the blue abyss. And is he gone for ever! and I come In vain?” Then sternly said the guide: “In vain! Sayst thou? what wouldst thou more? alas, O prince, None come for pastime here! but is it nought To turn thy feet from evil? is it nought Of pleasure to that shade if they are turn'd? For this thou camest hither: he who dares To penetrate this darkness, nor regards The dangers of the way, shall reascend In glory, nor the gates of hell retard His steps, nor demon's nor man's art prevail. Once in each hundred years, and only once, Whether by some rotation of the world, Or whether will'd so by some pow'r above, This flaming arch starts back, each realm descries Its opposite, and Bliss from her repose Freshens and feels her own security.” “Security!” cried out the Gadite king, “And feel they not compassion?” “Child of Earth,” Calmly said Aroar at his guest's surprise, “Some so disfigur'd by habitual crimes, Others are so exalted, so refined, So permeated by heaven, no trace remains Graven on earth: here Justice is supreme; Compassion can be but where passions are. Here are discover'd those who tortured Law To silence or to speech, as pleas'd themselves; Here also those who boasted of their zeal And lov'd their country for the spoils it gave. Hundreds, whose glitt'ring merchandise the lyre Dazzled vain wretches drunk with flattery, And wafted them in softest airs to Heaven, Doom'd to be still deceiv'd, here still attune The wonted strings and fondly woo applause: Their wish half granted, they retain their own, But madden at the mockery of the shades. Upon the river's other side there grow Deep olive groves; there other ghosts abide, Blest indeed they, but not supremely blest. We can not see beyond, we can not see Aught but our opposite; and here are fates How opposite to ours! here some observ'd Religious rites, some hospitality: Strangers, who from the good old men retired, Closed the gate gently, lest from generous use Shutting and opening of its own accord, It shake unsettled slumbers off their couch: Some stopt revenge athirst for slaughter, some Sow'd the slow olive for a race unborn. These had no wishes, therefore none are crown'd: But theirs are tufted banks, theirs umbrage, theirs Enough of sunshine to enjoy the shade, And breeze enough to lull them to repose.” Then Gebir cried: “Illustrious host, proceed. Bring me among the wonders of a realm Admired by all, but like a tale admired. We take our children from their cradled sleep, And on their fancy from our own impress Ethereal forms and adulating fates! But, ere departing for such scenes ourselves, We seize the hand, we hang upon the neck, Our beds cling heavy round us with our tears, Agony strives with agony. Just Gods! Wherefore should wretched mortals thus believe, Or wherefore should they hesitate to die?” Thus while he question'd, all his strength dissolv'd Within him, thunder shook his troubled brain, He started, and the cavern's mouth survey'd Near, and beyond his people; he arose, And bent toward them his bewilder'd way. FOURTH BOOK. The king's lone road, his visit, his return, Were not unknown to Dalica, nor long The wondrous tale from royal ears delay'd. When the young queen had heard who taught the rites, Her mind was shaken, and what first she askt Was, whether the sea-maids were very fair, And was it true that even gods were moved By female charms beneath the waves profound, And join'd to them in marriage, and had sons. Who knows but Gebir sprang then from the Gods! He that could pity, he that could obey, Flatter'd both female youth and princely pride, The same ascending from amid the shades Show'd Power in frightful attitude: the queen Marks the surpassing prodigy, and strives To shake off terror in her crowded court, And wonders why she trembles, nor suspects How Fear and Love assume each other's form, By birth and secret compact how allied. Vainly (to conscious virgins I appeal) Vainly with crouching tigers, prowling wolves, Rocks, precipices, waves, storms, thunderbolts, All his immense inheritance, would Fear The simplest heart, should Love refuse, assail: Consent, the maiden's pillowed ear imbibes Constancy, honour, truth, fidelity, Beauty and ardent lips and longing arms; Then fades in glimmering distance half the scene, Then her heart quails and flutters and would fly; 'Tis her beloved! not to her! ye Powers! What doubting maid exacts the vow? behold Above the myrtles his protesting hand! Such ebbs of doubt and swells of jealousy Toss the fond bosom in its hour of sleep And float around the eyelids and sink thro'. Lo! mirror of delight in cloudless days, Lo! thy reflection: 'twas when I exclaim'd, With kisses hurried as if each foresaw Their end, and reckon'd on our broken bonds, And could at such a price such loss endure, “O what to faithful lovers met at morn, What half so pleasant as imparted fears!” Looking recumbent how Love's column rose Marmoreal, trophied round with golden hair, How in the valley of one lip unseen He slumber'd, one his unstrung bow imprest. Sweet wilderness of soul-entangling charms! Led back by Memory, and each blissful maze Retracing, me with magic power detain Those dimpled cheeks, those temples violet-tinged, Those lips of nectar and those eyes of heaven! Charoba, tho' indeed she never drank The liquid pearl, or twined the nodding crown, Or, when she wanted cool and calm repose, Dreamt of the crawling asp and grated tomb, Was wretched up to royalty: the jibe Struck her, most piercing where love pierced before, From those whose freedom centres in their tongue, Handmaidens, pages, courtiers, priests, buffoons. Congratulations here, there prophecies, Here children, not repining at neglect While tumult sweeps them ample room for play; Every-where questions answer'd ere begun, Every-where crowds, for every-where alarm. Thus winter gone, nor spring (tho' near) arriv'd, Urged slanting onward by the bickering breeze That issues from beneath Aurora's car, Shudder the sombrous waves; at every beam More vivid, more by every breath impell'd, Higher and higher up the fretted rocks, Their turbulent refulgence they display. Madness, which like the spiral element The more it seizes on the fiercer burns, Hurried them blindly forward, and involved In flame the senses and in gloom the soul. Determin'd to protect the country's gods, And asking their protection, they adjure Each other to stand forward, and insist With zeal, and trample under foot the slow; And disregardful of the Sympathies Divine, those Sympathies whose delicate hand Touching the very eyeball of the heart, Awakens it, not wounds it nor inflames, Blind wretches! they with desperate embrace Hang on the pillar till the temple fall. Oft the grave judge alarms religious wealth And rouses anger under gentle words. Woe to the wiser few who dare to cry “People! these men are not your enemies, Inquire their errand, and resist when wrong'd.” Together childhood, priesthood, womanhood, The scribes and elders of the land, exclaim “Seek they not hidden treasure in the tombs? Raising the ruins, levelling the dust, Who can declare whose ashes they disturb? Build they not fairer cities than our own, Extravagant enormous apertures For light, and portals larger, open courts Where all ascending all are unconfin'd, And wider streets in purer air than ours? Temples quite plain with equal architraves They build, nor bearing gods like ours imbost. O profanation! O our ancestors!” Tho' all the vulgar hate a foreign face, It more offends weak eyes and homely age, Dalica most, who thus her aim pursued. “My promise, O Charoba, I perform. Proclaim to gods and men a festival Throughout the land, and bid the strangers eat! Their anger thus we haply may disarm.” “O Dalica,” the grateful queen replied, “Nurse of my childhood, soother of my cares, Preventer of my wishes, of my thoughts, O pardon youth, O pardon royalty! If hastily to Dalica I sued, Fear might impell me, never could distrust. Go then, for wisdom guides thee, take my name, Issue what most imports and best beseems, And sovranty shall sanction the decree.” And now Charoba was alone, her heart Grew lighter; she sat down, and she arose, She felt voluptuous tenderness, but felt That tenderness for Dalica; she prais'd Her kind attention, warm solicitude, Her wisdom; for what wisdom pleas'd like hers! She was delighted; should she not behold Gebir? she blusht; but she had words to speak, She form'd them and reform'd them, with regret That there was somewhat lost with every change; She could replace them; what would that avail? Moved from their order they have lost their charm. While thus she strew'd her way with softest words, Others grew up before her, but appear'd A plenteous rather than perplexing choice: She rubb'd her palms with pleasure, heav'd a sigh, Grew calm again, and thus her thoughts revolv'd. “But he descended to the tombs! the thought Thrills me, I must avow it, with affright. And wherefore? shows he not the more belov'd Of heav'n? or how ascends he back to-day? Then has he wrong'd me? could he want a cause Who has an army and was bred to reign? And yet no reasons against rights he urged, He threaten'd not, proclaim'd not; I approacht, He hasten'd on; I spake, he listen'd; wept, He pity'd me; he lov'd me, he obey'd; He was a conqueror, still am I a queen.” She thus indulged fond fancies, when the sound Of timbrels and of cymbals struck her ear, And horns and howlings of wild jubilee. She fear'd, and listened to confirm her fears; One breath sufficed, and shook her refluent soul. Smiting, with simulated smile constrain'd, Her beauteous bosom, “O perfidious man, O cruel foe!” she twice and thrice exclaim'd, “O my companions, equal-aged! my throne! My people! O how wretched to presage This day! how tenfold wretched to endure!” She ceast, and instantly the palace rang With gratulation roaring into rage; 'Twas her own people. “Health to Gebir! health To our compatriot subjects! to our queen Health and unfaded youth ten thousand years!” Then went the victims forward crown'd with flowers, Crown'd were tame crocodiles, and boys white-robed Guided their creaking crests across the stream. In gilded barges went the female train, And, hearing others ripple near, undrew The veil of sea-green awning: if they found Whom they desired, how pleasant was the breeze! If not, the frightful water forced a sigh. Sweet airs of music ruled the rowing palms, Now rose they glistening and aslant reclined, Now they descended and with one consent Plunging, seem'd swift each other to pursue, And now to tremble wearied o'er the wave. Beyond and in the suburbs might be seen Crowds of all ages: here in triumph past Not without pomp, tho' rais'd with rude device, The monarch and Charoba; there a throng Shone out in sunny whiteness o'er the reeds: Nor could luxuriant youth, or lapsing age Propt by the corner of the nearest street, With aching eyes and tottering knees intent, Loose leathery neck and wormlike lip outstretcht, Fix long the ken upon one form, so swift Thro' the gay vestures fluttering on the bank, And thro' the bright-eyed waters dancing round, Wove they their wanton wiles and disappear'd. Meantime, with pomp august and solemn, borne On four white camels tinkling plates of gold, Heralds before and Ethiop slaves behind, Each with the sign of office in his hand, Each on his brow the sacred stamp of years, The four ambassadors of peace proceed. Rich carpets bear they, corn and generous wine, The Syrian olive's cheerful gift they bear, With stubborn goats that eye the mountain-top Askance, and riot with reluctant horn, And steeds and stately camels in their train. The king, who sat before his tent, descried The dust rise redden'd from the setting sun: Thro' all the plains below the Gadite men Were resting from their labour: some surveyed The spacious site ere yet obstructed; walls Already, soon will roofs have interposed; Some ate their frugal viands on the steps Contented; some, remembering home, prefer The cot's bare rafters o'er the gilded dome, And sing (for often sighs too end in song) “In smiling meads how sweet the brook's repose To the rough ocean and red restless sands! Where are the woodland voices that increast Along the unseen path on festal days, When lay the dry and outcast arbutus On the fane-step, and the first privet-flowers Threw their white light upon the vernal shrine?” Some heedless trip along with hasty step Whistling, and fix too soon on their abodes; Haply and one among them with his spear Measures the lintel, if so great its highth As will receive him with his helm unlower'd. But silence went throughout, e'en thoughts were husht, When to full view of navy and of camp Now first expanded the bare-headed train. Majestic unpresuming, unappall'd, Onward they marcht, and neither to the right Nor to the left, tho' there the city stood, Turn'd they their sober eyes; and now they reacht Within a few steep paces of ascent The lone pavilion of the Iberian king: He saw them, he awaited them, he rose, He hail'd them, “Peace be with you:” they replied “King of the western world, be with you peace.” FIFTH BOOK. Once a fair city, courted then by kings, Mistress of nations, throng'd by palaces, Raising her head o'er destiny, her face Glowing with pleasure and with palms refresht, Now pointed at by Wisdom or by Wealth, Bereft of beauty, bare of ornament, Stood in the wilderness of woe, Masar. Ere far advancing, all appear'd a plain, Treacherous and fearful mountains, far advanced. Her glory so gone down, at human step The fierce hyena frighted from the walls Bristled his rising back, his teeth unsheathed, Drew the long growl and with slow foot retired. Yet were remaining some of ancient race, And ancient arts were now their sole delight. With Time's first sickle they had markt the hour When at their incantation would the Moon Start back, and shuddering shed blue blasted light. The rifted rays they gather'd, and immerst In potent portion of that wondrous wave, Which, hearing rescued Israel, stood erect, And led her armies thro' his crystal gates. Hither (none shared her way, her counsel none) Hied the Masarian Dalica: 'twas night, And the still breeze fell languid on the waste. She, tired with journey long and ardent thoughts, Stopt; and before the city she descried A female form emerge above the sands: Intent she fixt her eyes, and on herself Relying, with fresh vigour bent her way; Nor disappear'd the woman; but exclaim'd, (One hand retaining tight her folded vest) “Stranger! who loathest life, there lies Masar. Begone, nor tarry longer, or ere morn The cormorant in his solitary haunt Of insulated rock or sounding cove Stands on thy bleached bones and screams for prey. My lips can scatter them o'er every sea Under the rising and the setting sun, So shrivel'd in one breath as all the sands We tread on, could not in a hundred years. Wretched who die nor raise their sepulchre! Therefore begone.” But Dalica unaw'd, (Tho' in her wither'd but still firm right-hand, Held up with imprecations hoarse and deep, Glimmer'd her brazen sickle, and enclosed Within its figured curve the fading moon) Spake thus aloud. “By yon bright orb of Heaven, In that most sacred moment when her beam (Guided first thither by the forked shaft,) Strikes thro' the crevice of Arishtah's tower . . .” “Sayst thou?” astonisht cried the sorceress, “Woman of outer darkness, fiend of death, From what inhuman cave, what dire abyss, Hast thou invisible that spell o'erheard? What potent hand hath toucht thy quicken'd corse, What song dissolv'd thy cerements? who unclosed Those faded eyes and fill'd them from the stars? But if with inextinguish'd light of life Thou breathest, soul and body unamerst, Then whence that invocation? who hath dared Those hallow'd words, divulging, to profane?” Dalica cried, “To heaven not earth addrest Prayers for protection can not be profane.” Here the pale sorceress turn'd her face aside Wildly, and mutter'd to herself amazed, “I dread her who, alone at such an hour, Can speak so strangely, who can thus combine The words of reason with our gifted rites, Yet will I speak once more. If thou hast seen The city of Charoba, hast thou markt The steps of Dalica?” “What then?” “The tongue Of Dalica has then our rights divulged.” “Whose rites?” “Her mother's.” “Never.” “One would think, Presumptuous, thou wert Dalica.” “I am; Woman! and who art thou?” With close embrace, Clung the Masarian round her neck, and cried, “Art thou then not my sister? ah! I fear The golden lamps and jewels of a court Deprive thine eyes of strength and purity: O Dalica! mine watch the waning moon, For ever patient in our mother's art, And rest on Heaven suspended, where the founts Of Wisdom rise, where sound the wings of Power; Studies intense of strong and stern delight! And thou too, Dalica, so many years Wean'd from the bosom of thy native land, Returnest back and seekest true repose. O what more pleasant than the short-breath'd sigh When, laying down your burthen at the gate And dizzy with long wandering, you embrace The cool and quiet of a homespun bed.” “Alas!” said Dalica, “tho' all commend This choice, and many meet with no controul, Yet none pursue it! Age by care opprest Feels for the couch and drops into the grave. The tranquil scene lies further still from Youth: Frenzied Ambition and desponding Love Consume Youth's fairest flowers; compared with Youth Age has a something like repose. Myrthyr, I seek not here a boundary Like the horizon, which, as you advance, Keeping its form and colour, yet recedes: But mind my errand, and my suit perform. “Twelve years ago Charoba first could speak: If her indulgent father askt her name, She would indulge him too, and would reply What? why, Charoba! rais'd with sweet surprise, And proud to shine a teacher in her turn. Show her the graven sceptre; what its use? 'Twas to beat dogs with, and to gather flies. She thought the crown a plaything to amuse Herself, and not the people, for she thought Who mimick infant words might infant toys: But while she watcht grave elders look with awe On such a bauble, she withheld her breath; She was afraid her parents should suspect They had caught childhood from her in a kiss; She blusht for shame, and fear'd; for she believ'd. Yet was not courage wanting in the child. No; I have often seen her with both hands Shake a dry crocodile of equal highth, And listen to the shells within the scales, And fancy there was life, and yet apply The jagged jaws wide-open to her ear. Past are three summers since she first beheld The ocean; all around the child await Some exclamation of amazement here: She coldly said, her long-lasht eyes abased, Is this the mighty ocean? Is this all! That wondrous soul Charoba once possest, Capacious then as earth or heaven could hold, Soul discontented with capacity, Is gone (I fear) for ever. Need I say She was enchanted by the wicked spells Of Gebir, whom with lust of power inflamed The western winds have landed on our coast. I since have watcht her in each lone retreat, Have heard her sigh and soften out the name, Then would she change it for Egyptian sounds More sweet, and seem to taste them on her lips, Then loathe them; Gebir, Gebir still return'd. Who would repine, of reason not bereft! For soon the sunny stream of Youth runs down, And not a gadfly streaks the lake beyond. Lone in the gardens, on her gather'd vest How gently would her languid arm recline! How often have I seen her kiss a flower, And on cool mosses press her glowing cheek! Nor was the stranger free from pangs himself. Whether by spell imperfect, or, while brew'd, The swelling herbs infected him with foam. Oft have the shepherds met him wandering Thro' unfrequented paths, oft overheard Deep groans, oft started from soliloquies, Which they believe assuredly were meant For spirits who attended him unseen. But when from his illuded eyes retired That figure Fancy fondly chose to raise, He claspt the vacant air and stood and gazed; Then owning it was folly, strange to tell, Burst into peals of laughter at his woes; Next, when his passion had subsided, went Where from a cistern, green and ruin'd, ooz'd A little rill, soon lost; there gather'd he Violets, and harebells of a sister bloom, Twining complacently their tender stems With plants of kindest pliability. These for a garland woven, for a crown He platted pithy rushes, and ere dusk The grass was whiten'd with their roots nipt off. These threw he, finisht, in the little rill And stood surveying them with steady smile: But such a smile as that of Gebir bids To Comfort a defiance, to Despair A welcome, at whatever hour she please. Had I observ'd him I had pitied him, I have observed Charoba: I have askt If she loved Gebir. Love him! she exclaim'd With such a start of terror, such a flush Of anger, I love Gebir? I in love? And lookt so piteous, so impatient lookt . . And burst, before I answered, into tears. Then saw I, plainly saw I, 'twas not love; For such her natural temper, what she likes She speaks it out, or rather she commands: And could Charoba say with greater ease Bring me a water-melon from the Nile, Than, if she lov'd him, Bring me him I love. Therefore the death of Gebir is resolv'd.” “Resolv'd indeed,” cried Myrthyr, nought surprised, “Precious my arts! I could without remorse Kill, tho' I hold thee dearer than the day, E'en thee thyself, to exercise my arts. Look yonder! mark yon pomp of funeral! Is this from fortune or from favouring stars? Dalica, look thou yonder, what a train! What weeping! O what luxury! come, haste, Gather me quickly up these herbs I dropt, And then away . . hush! I must unobserv'd From those two maiden sisters pull the spleen: Dissemblers! how invidious they surround The virgin's tomb, where all but virgins weep.” “Nay, hear me first,” cried Dalica, “'tis hard To perish to attend a foreign king.” “Perish! and may not then mine eye alone Draw out the venom-drop, and yet remain Enough? the portion can not be perceiv'd.” Away she hasten'd with it to her home, And, sprinkling thrice fresh sulphur o'er the hearth, Took up a spindle with malignant smile, And pointed to a woof, nor spake a word; 'Twas a dark purple, and its dye was dread. Plunged in a lonely house, to her unknown, Now Dalica first trembled: o'er the roof Wander'd her haggard eyes . . 'twas some relief . . The massy stones, tho' hewn most roughly, show'd The hand of man had once at least been there: But from this object sinking back amazed, Her bosom lost all consciousness, and shook As if suspended in unbounded space. Her thus entranced the sister's voice recall'd, “Behold it here! dyed once again, 'tis done.” Dalica stept, and felt beneath her feet The slippery floor, with moulder'd dust bestrewn: But Myrthyr seiz'd with bare bold-sinew'd arm The grey cerastes, writhing from her grasp, And twisted off his horn, nor fear'd to squeeze The viscous poison from his glowing gums. Nor wanted there the root of stunted shrub Which he lays ragged, hanging o'er the sands, And whence the weapons of his wrath are death; Nor the blue urchin that with clammy fin Holds down the tossing vessel for the tides. Together these her scient hand combined, And more she added, dared I mention more. Which done, with words most potent, thrice she dipt The reeking garb; thrice waved it through the air: She ceast; and suddenly the creeping wool Shrunk up with crisped dryness in her hands: “Take this,” she cried, “and Gebir is no more.” SIXTH BOOK. Now to Aurora borne by dappled steeds The sacred gate of orient pearl and gold, Smitten with Lucifer's light silver wand, Expounded slow to strains of harmony; The waves beneath in purpling rows, like doves Glancing with wanting coyness tow'rd their queen, Heav'd softly; thus the damsel's bosom heaves When from her sleeping lover's downy cheek, To which so warily her own she brings Each moment nearer, she perceives the warmth Of coming kisses fann'd by playful Dreams. Ocean and earth and heaven was jubilee, For 'twas the morning pointed out by Fate When an immortal maid and mortal man Should share each other's nature knit in bliss. The brave Iberians far the beach o'erspread Ere dawn, with distant awe; none hear the mew, None mark the curlew flapping o'er the field; Silence held all, and fond expectancy. Now suddenly the conch above the sea Sounds, and goes sounding through the woods profound. They, where they hear the echo, turn their eyes, But nothing see they, save a purple mist Roll from the distant mountain down the shore: It rolls, it sails, it settles, it dissolves: Now shines the Nymph to human eye reveal'd, And leads her Tamar timorous o'er the waves. Immortals crowding round congratulate The shepherd; he shrinks back, of breath bereft: His vesture clinging closely round his limbs Unfelt, while they the whole fair form admire, He fears that he has lost it, then he fears The wave has mov'd it, most to look he fears. Scarce the sweet-flowing music he imbibes, Or sees the peopled ocean; scarce he sees Spio with sparkling eyes, and Beroe Demure, and young Ione, less renown'd, Not less divine; mild-natured, Beauty form'd Her face, her heart Fidelity; for Gods Design'd, a mortal too Ione lov'd. These were the Nymphs elected for the hour Of Hesperus and Hymen; these had strown The bridal bed, these tuned afresh the shells, Wiping the green that hoarsen'd them within; These wove the chaplets, and at night resolv'd To drive the dolphins from the wreathed door. Gebir surveyed the concourse from the tents, The Egyptian men around him; 'twas observ'd By those below how wistfully he lookt, From what attention with what earnestness Now to his city, now to theirs, he waved His hand, and held it, while they spake, outspread. They tarried with him and they shared the feast; They stoopt with trembling hand from heavy jars The wines of Gades gurgling in the bowl; Nor bent they homeward till the moon appear'd To hang midway betwixt the earth and skies. 'Twas then that leaning o'er the boy belov'd, In Ocean's grot where Ocean was unheard, “Tamar!” the Nymph said gently, “come, awake! Enough to love, enough to sleep, is given, Haste we away.” This Tamar deem'd deceit, Spoken so fondly, and he kist her lips, Nor blusht he then, for he was then unseen. But she arising bade the youth arise. “What cause to fly?” said Tamar; she replied “Ask none for flight, and feign none for delay.” “O am I then deceived! or am I cast From dreams of pleasure to eternal sleep, And, when I cease to shudder, cease to be!” She held the downcast bridegroom to her breast, Lookt in his face and charm'd away his fears. She said not “wherefore have I then embraced You a poor shepherd, or at most a man, Myself a Nymph, that now I should deceive?” She said not . . Tamar did, and was ashamed. Him overcome her serious voice bespake. “Grief favours all who bring the gift of tears: Mild at first sight he meets his votaries And casts no shadow as he comes along; But, after his embrace, the marble chills The pausing foot, the closing door sounds loud, The fiend in triumph strikes the roof, then falls The eye uplifted from his lurid shade. Tamar, depress thyself, and miseries Darken and widen: yes, proud-hearted man! The sea-bird rises as the billows rise; Nor otherwise when mountain floods descend Smiles the unsullied lotus glossy-hair'd; Thou, claiming all things, leanest on thy claim Till overwhelmed through incompliancy. Tamar, some silent tempest gathers round!” “Round whom?” retorted Tamar, “thou describe The danger, I will dare it.” “Who will dare What is unseen?” “The man that is unblest.” “But wherefore thou? It threatens not thyself, Nor me, but Gebir and the Gadite host.” “The more I know, the more a wretch am I,” Groan'd deep the troubled youth, “still thou proceed.” “Oh seek not destin'd evils to divine, Found out at last too soon! cease here the search, 'Tis vain, 'tis impious, 'tis no gift of mine: I will impart far better, will impart What makes, when Winter comes, the Sun to rest So soon on Ocean's bed his paler brow, And Night to tarry so at Spring's return. And I will tell sometimes the fate of men Who loost from drooping neck the restless arm Adventurous, ere long nights had satisfied The sweet and honest avarice of love! How whirlpools have absorb'd them, storms o'erwhelm'd, And how amid their struggles and their prayers The big wave blacken'd o'er the mouth supine: Then, when my Tamar trembles at the tale, Kissing his lips half-open with surprise, Glance from the gloomy story, and with glee Light on the fairer fables of the Gods. “Thus we may sport at leisure when we go Where, lov'd by Neptune and the Naiad, lov'd By pensive Dryad pale, and Oread, The sprightly Nymph whom constant Zephyr woos, Rhine rolls his beryl-colour'd wave; than Rhine What river from the mountains ever came More stately? most the simple crown adorns Of rushes and of willows intertwined With here and there a flower: his lofty brow Shaded with vines and misletoe and oak He rears, and mystic bards his fame resound. Or gliding opposite, th' Illyrian gulf Will harbour us from ill.” While thus she spake She toucht his eyelashes with libant lip And breath'd ambrosial odours, o'er his cheek Celestial warmth suffusing: grief disperst, And strength and pleasure beam'd upon his brow. Then pointed she before him: first arose To his astonisht and delighted view The sacred isle that shrines the queen of love. It stood so near him, so acute each sense, That not the symphony of lutes alone Or coo serene or billing strife of doves, But murmurs, whispers, nay the very sighs Which he himself had utter'd once, he heard. Next, but long after and far off, appear The cloudlike cliffs and thousand towers of Crete, And further to the right the Cyclades; Phœbus had rais'd and fixt them, to surround His native Delos and aërial fane. He saw the land of Pelops, host of Gods, Saw the steep ridge where Corinth after stood Beckoning the serious with the smiling Arts Into her sunbright bay; unborn the maid That to assure the bent-up hand unskill'd Lookt oft, but oftener fearing who might wake. He heard the voice of rivers; he descried Pindan Peneüs and the slender Nymphs That tread his banks but fear the thundering tide; These, and Amphrysos and Apidanos And poplar-crown'd Sperchios, and, reclined On restless rocks, Enipeus, where the winds Scatter'd above the weeds his hoary hair. Then, with Pirenè and with Panopè, Evenos, troubled from paternal tears, And last was Acheloös, king of isles. Zacynthos here, above rose Ithaca, Like a blue bubble floating in the bay. Far onward to the left a glimmering light Glanced out oblique, nor vanisht; he inquired Whence that arose; his consort thus replied. “Behold the vast Eridanus! ere long We may again behold him and rejoice. Of noble rivers none with mightier force Rolls his unwearied torrent to the main.” And now Sicanian Ætna rose to view: Darkness with light more horrid she confounds, Baffles the breath and dims the sight of day. Tamar grew giddy with astonishment And, looking up, held fast the bridal vest; He heard the roar above him, heard the roar Beneath, and felt it too, as he beheld, Hurl, from Earth's base, rocks, mountains, to the skies. Meanwhile the Nymph had fixt her eyes beyond, As seeing somewhat, not intent on aught: He, more amazed than ever, then exclaim'd “Is there another flaming isle? or this Illusion, thus past over unobserved?” “Look yonder,” cried the Nymph, without reply, “Look yonder!” Tamar lookt, and saw afar Where the waves whitened on the desert shore. When from amid grey ocean first he caught The highths of Calpè, sadden'd he exclaim'd, “Rock of Iberia! fixt by Jove, and hung With all his thunder-bearing clouds, I hail Thy ridges rough and cheerless! what tho' Spring Nor kiss thy brow nor cool it with a flower, Yet will I hail thee, hail thy flinty couch Where Valour and where Virtue have reposed.” The Nymph said, sweetly smiling, “Fickle Man Would not be happy could he not regret; And I confess how, looking back, a thought Has toucht and tuned or rather thrill'd my heart, Too soft for sorrow and too strong for joy; Fond foolish maid! 'twas with mine own accord It sooth'd me, shook me, melted, drown'd, in tears. But weep not thou; what cause hast thou to weep? Would'st thou thy country? would'st those caves abhorr'd, Dungeons and portals that exclude the day? Gebir, though generous, just, humane, inhaled Rank venom from these mansions. Rest, O king, In Egypt thou! nor, Tamar! pant for sway. With horrid chorus, Pain, Diseases, Death, Stamp on the slippery pavement of the proud, And ring their sounding emptiness through earth. Possess the ocean, me, thyself, and peace.” And now the chariot of the Sun descends, The waves rush hurried from his foaming steeds, Smoke issues from their nostrils at the gate, Which, when they enter, with huge golden bar Atlas and Calpè close across the sea. SEVENTH BOOK. What mortal first by adverse fate assail'd, Trampled by tyranny or scofft by scorn, Stung by remorse or wrung by poverty, Bade with fond sigh his native land farewell? Wretched! but tenfold wretched who resolv'd Against the waves to plunge the expatriate keel Deep with the richest harvest of his land! Driven with that weak blast which Winter leaves Closing his palace-gates on Caucasus, Oft hath a berry risen forth a shade; From the same parent plant another lies Deaf to the daily call of weary hind; Zephyrs pass by and laugh at his distress. By every lake's and every river's side The Nymphs and Naiads teach equality; In voices gently querulous they ask, “Who would with aching head and toiling arms Bear the full pitcher to the stream far off? Who would, of power intent on high emprise, Deem less the praise to fill the vacant gulf Than raise Charybdis upon Ætna's brow?” Amid her darkest caverns most retired, Nature calls forth her filial elements To close around and crush that monster Void: Fire, springing fierce from his resplendent throne, And Water, dashing the devoted wretch Woundless and whole with iron-colour'd mace, Or whirling headlong in his war-belt's fold. Mark well the lesson, man! and spare thy kind. Go, from their midnight darkness wake the woods, Woo the lone forest in her last retreat; Many still bend their beauteous heads unblest And sigh aloud for elemental man. Thro' palaces and porches evil eyes Light upon e'en the wretched, who have fled The house of bondage or the house of birth; Suspicions, murmurs, treacheries, taunts, retorts, Attend the brighter banners that invade, And the first horn of hunter, pale with want, Sounds to the chase, the second sounds to war. The long-awaited day at last arrived When, linkt together by the seven-armed Nile, Egypt with proud Iberia should unite. Here the Tartessian, there the Gadite tents Rang with impatient pleasure: here engaged Woody Nebrissa's quiver-bearing crew, Contending warm with amicable skill, While they of Durius raced along the beach And scatter'd mud and jeers on all behind. The strength of Bætis too removed the helm And stript the corslet off, and stauncht the foot Against the mossy maple, while they tore Their quivering lances from the hissing wound. Others push forth the prows of their compeers, And the wave, parted by the pouncing beak, Swells up the sides and closes far astern: The silent oars now dip their level wings, And weary with strong stroke the whitening waves. Others, afraid of tardiness, return: Now, entering the still harbour, every surge Runs with a louder murmur up their keel, And the slack cordage rattles round the mast. Sleepless with pleasure and expiring fears Had Gebir risen ere the break of dawn, And o'er the plains appointed for the feast Hurried with ardent step: the swains admired What so transversely could have swept the dews. For never long one path had Gebir trod, Nor long, unheeding man, one pace preserv'd. Not thus Charoba: she despair'd the day; The day was present; true; yet she despair'd. In the too tender and once tortured heart Doubts gather strength from habit, like disease; Fears, like the needle verging to the pole, Tremble and tremble into certainty. How often, when her maids with merry voice Call'd her, and told the sleepless queen 'twas morn, How often would she feign some fresh delay, And tell 'em (though they saw) that she arose. Next to her chamber, closed by cedar doors, A bath of purest marble, purest wave, On its fair surface bore its pavement high: Arabian gold enchased the crystal roof, With fluttering boys adorn'd and girls unrobed; These, when you touch the quiet water, start From their aërial sunny arch, and pant Entangled mid each other's flowery wreaths, And each pursuing is in turned pursued. Here came at last, as ever wont at morn, Charoba: long she lingered at the brink, Often she sigh'd, and, naked as she was, Sate down, and leaning on the couch's edge, On the soft inward pillow of her arm Rested her burning cheek: she moved her eyes; She blusht; and blushing plunged into the wave. Now brazen chariots thunder through each street, And neighing steeds paw proudly from delay. While o'er the palace breathes the dulcimer, Lute, and aspiring harp, and lisping reed, Loud rush the trumpets bursting through the throng And urge the high-shoulder'd vulgar; now are heard Curses and quarrels and constricted blows, Threats and defiance and suburban war. Hark! the reiterated clangour sounds! Now murmurs, like the sea or like the storm Or like the flames on forests, move and mount From rank to rank, and loud and louder roll, Till all the people is one vast applause. Yes, 'tis herself, Charoba. Now the strife To see again a form so often seen. Feel they some partial pang, some secret void, Some doubt of feasting those fond eyes again? Panting imbibe they that refreshing sight To reproduce in hour of bitterness? She goes, the king awaits her from the camp: Him she descried, and trembled ere he reacht Her car, but shuddered paler at his voice. So the pale silver at the festive board Grows paler fill'd afresh and dew'd with wine; So seems the tenderest herbage of the spring To whiten, bending from a balmy gale. The beauteous queen alighting he received, And sigh'd to loose her from his arms; she hung A little longer on them through her fears. Her maidens follow'd her; and one that watcht, One that had call'd her in the morn, observ'd How virgin passion with unfuel'd flame Burns into whiteness, while the blushing cheek Imagination heats and shame imbues. Between both nations drawn in ranks they pass: The priests, with linen ephods, linen robes, Attend their steps, some follow, some precede, Where clothed with purple intertwined with gold Two lofty thrones commanded land and main. Behind and near them numerous were the tents As freckled clouds o'erfloat our vernal skies, Numerous as wander in warm moonlight nights Along Meänder's or Caÿster's marsh Swans pliant-neckt and village storks revered. Throughout each nation moved the hum confused, Like that from myriad wings o'er Scythian cups Of frothy milk, concreted soon with blood. Throughout the fields the savoury smoke ascends, And boughs and branches shade the hides unbroacht. Some roll the flowery turf into a seat, And others press the helmet. Now resounds The signal! queen and monarch mount the thrones. The brazen clarion hoarsens: many leagues Above them, many to the south, the heron Rising with hurried croak and throat outstretcht, Ploughs up the silvering surface of her plain. Tottering with age's zeal and mischief's haste Now was discover'd Dalica; she reacht The throne, she lean'd against the pedestal, And now ascending stood before the king. Prayers for his health and safety she preferr'd, And o'er his head and o'er his feet she threw Myrrh, nard, and cassia, from three golden urns; His robe of native woof she next removed, And round his shoulders drew the garb accurst, And bow'd her head, departing: soon the queen Saw the blood mantle in his manly cheek, And fear'd, and faultering sought her lost replies, And blest the silence that she wisht were broke. Alas, unconscious maiden! night shall close, And love and sovranty and life dissolve, And Egypt be one desert drencht in blood. When thunder overhangs the fountain-head, Losing its wonted freshness every stream Grows turbid, grows with sickly warmth suffused: Thus were the brave Iberians when they saw The king of nations from his throne descend. Scarcely, with pace uneven, knees unnerv'd, Reacht he the waters: in his troubled ear They sounded murmuring drearily; they rose Wild, in strange colours, to his parching eyes; They seem'd to rush around him, seem'd to lift From the receding earth his helpless feet. He fell: Charoba shriekt aloud; she ran; Frantic with fears and fondness, mazed with woe, Nothing but Gebir dying she beheld. The turban that betray'd its golden charge Within, the veil that down her shoulder hung, All fallen at her feet! the furthest wave Creeping with silent progress up the sand, Glided through all, and rais'd their hollow folds. In vain they bore him to the sea, in vain Rubb'd they his temples with the briny warmth; He struggled from them, strong with agony, He rose half-up, he fell again, he cried “Charoba! O Charoba!” she embraced His neck, and raising on her knee one arm, Sigh'd when it moved not, when it fell she shriekt, And clasping loud both hands above her head, She call'd on Gebir, call'd on earth, on heaven. “Who will believe me? what shall I protest? How innocent, thus wretched? God of Gods, Strike me . . who most offend thee most defy . . Charoba most offends thee: strike me, hurl From this accursed land, this faithless throne. O Dalica! see here the royal feast! See here the gorgeous robe! you little thought How have the demons dyed that robe with death. Where are ye, dear fond parents! when ye heard My feet in childhood pat the palace-floor, Ye started forth and kist away surprise: Will ye now meet me? how, and where, and when? And must I fill your bosom with my tears, And, what I never have done, with your own? Why have the Gods thus punisht me? what harm Have ever I done them? have I profaned Their temples, askt too little, or too much? Proud if they granted, griev'd if they withheld? O mother! stand between your child and them! Appease them, soothe them, soften their revenge, Melt them to pity with maternal tears. Alas, but if you can not! they themselves Will then want pity rather than your child. O Gebir! best of monarchs, best of men, What realm hath ever thy firm even hand Or lost by feebleness or held by force? Behold thy cares and perils how repaid! Behold the festive day, the nuptial hour!” Thus raved Charoba; horror, grief, amaze, Pervaded all the host; all eyes were fixt; All stricken motionless and mute: the feast Was like the feast of Cepheus, when the sword Of Phineus, white with wonder, shook restrain'd, And the hilt rattled in his marble hand. She heard not, saw not, every sense was gone; One passion banisht all; dominion, praise, The world itself, was nothing. Senseless man! What would thy fancy figure now from worlds? There is no world to those that grieve and love. She hung upon his bosom, prest his lips, Breath'd, and would feign it his that she resorb'd. She chafed the feathery softness of his veins, That swell'd out black, like tendrils round their vase After libation: lo! he moves! he groans! He seems to struggle from the grasp of death! Charoba shriekt and fell away, her hand Still clasping his, a sudden blush o'erspread Her pallid humid cheek, and disappear'd. 'Twas not the blush of shame; what shame has woe? 'Twas not the genuine ray of hope; it flasht With shuddering glimmer through unscatter'd clouds, It flasht from passions rapidly opposed. Never so eager, when the world was waves, Stood the less daughter of the ark, and tried (Innocent this temptation!) to recall With folded vest and casting arm the dove; Never so fearful, when amid the vines Rattled the hail, and when the light of heaven Closed, since the wreck of Nature, first eclipst, And she was eager for his life's return, As she was fearful how his groans might end. They ended: cold and languid calm succeeds; His eyes have lost their lustre, but his voice Is not unheard, though short: he spake these words. “And weepest thou, Charoba! shedding tears More precious than the jewels that surround The neck of kings entomb'd! then weep, fair queen, At once thy pity and my pangs assuage. Ah! what is grandeur? glory? they are past! When nothing else, not life itself, remains, Still the fond mourner may be call'd our own. Should I complain of Fortune? how she errs, Scattering her bounty upon barren ground, Slow to allay the lingering thirst of toil? Fortune, 'tis true, may err, may hesitate, Death follows close, nor hesitates, nor errs. I feel the stroke! I die!” He would extend His dying arm: it fell upon his breast; Cold sweat and shivering ran o'er every limb, His eyes grew stiff, he struggled, and expired. FROM THE PHOCÆANS. Heroes of old would I commemorate. Those heroes, who obeyed the high decree To leave Phocæa, and erect in Gaul Empire, the fairest heaven had e'er design'd; And, borne amidst them, I would dedicate To thee O Liberty, the golden spoils. For, Liberty, 'tis thou whose voice awakes Their sons, from slumber in the setting beams Of sceptred Power, and banishest from Earth, Tho' tardier than hell's heaviest cloud she move, And leave behind the wizard cup and sword— Circæn soul-dissolving Monarchy. Say, daughters of Mnemosyne and Jove, Speak, hearts of harmony! what sacred cause United, so long sever'd, in debate, Pallas and Neptune? 'Twas when every god Flew shuddering from the royal feast accurst, With Ceres most offended, these ordain Th' eternal terror of proud thrones to rise: Such among eastern thrones Phocæa stood, Such, amid Europe's oaken groves retired. Now had Priené mourn'd her murder'd swains, Who late ascending Mycalé, released The pipe, and sitting on the wayside crag Temper'd the tabor to their roundelays: Of brittle ivy, from the living stone Stript off with haste, before their partners came, Chaplets to ward off envy they combined, To ward off envy, not to ward off death, Nor to survive themselves: now with amaze Meander, rising slow from sedgey bed, Sees soaring high the white-wing'd multitude Of cranes and cycnets, like a sunny cloud, Nor till they circle lower, distinguishes The aerial blue between, and feeble cries From thin protruded throat: Pactolus tore His yellow hair with human blood defiled, And spurn'd his treacherous waves and tempting sand. Of cities built by heroes built by Gods, Throughout the Ægæan, Asia now surveyed None but Phocæa free: her bolder youth The galling yoke of gifted peace disdain. On far Iberia's friendly coast arrived, Rich streamers, snatched from conquest they display; And Persic spoils, in sportive mockery worn, Flutter and rustle round the steeds, that rear'd Amid the caverns of the genial winds, On Tagrus' top, start sidelong from the tide. All are advanced to manhood for the hour. With sweet solicitude and fearful joy, Each mother from the shaded ship descries Her son amidst the contest, and her son Or now excels each rival in the race, Or if behind them will ere long excel. Naarchus, whose attemper'd hand heaven-taught, Directed thro' wide seas and wearying straits To rich Tartessus the Phocæan sails, Now, leaning back against a stranded skiff, Drawn till half upright on the shelving beach, Turns idly round the rudder in its rest, And hardly thinks of land; warm youth attracts, As amber sweet, the wither'd reed of age. Such on the banks of Hermus, on the banks Of that most pleasant of all sacred streams, For 'twas the nearest to his native home, And first that exercised his crooked oar, Now distant, swelling forth with sweet regrets!— Such was Naarchus! steadfastly he gazed, And harmless envy heav'd one mindful sigh. Meanwhile, with Euxenus, and Hyelus, In council sage, but stricken sore by years, And Cimos, firm in friendship, firm in fight, And more, whose wisdom, and whose bravery, The hallowed bosom of but few records, Men, high in nature, high in sphere of souls That burn in battle, or that shine in peace— Protis, the son of Cyrnus, in the halls Of Arganthonius, suppliant thus implores His peace, and his protection. “Mighty king, If ever thou injuriously hast borne The rage of ruthless war, and surely war Hath envied and hath visited, a realm So flourishing, so prosperous, behold The scattered ruins of no humble race.” Amid these words, a little from the ground He rais'd his aching eyes, and waved his hand Where over citron bowers and light arcades Hung the fresh garlands fluttering from the mast: Then paused; the hoary monarch, stung with grief, Sate silent, and observ'd the frequent tear Flow bitterly from off each manly cheek, Uninterrupted! for the hero's soul Flew back upon his country's wrongs and grown Impatient of the pity it required, Sunk into sorrow: thus, his foes had said, Had foes e'er seen him thus, the helpless child Putting one arm against its mother's breast, Holds out the other to a stranger's hand, But, e'er receiv'd, it weeps: th' Iberian king Then answer'd, “Just and holy are the tears Of warriors; sweet as cassia to the Gods, To man and misery they're the dew of heaven, But wherefore thus disconsolate! this arm Might heretofore have rescued and avenged, And now perhaps may succour.” He embraced The stranger, and embracing him, perceived His heart beat heavy thro' his panting vest; Then thus continued, “We too have endured Insulting power, insatiate avarice, But ere the wrongs we suffer'd half were told The sun more rapid now his rays decline Would leave the Atlantic wave.” The patriot chiefs Around, burn each to hear his own exploits And see the history open on his name. Fain would they seize congenial glances, fain Force attestation from the question'd eye: So pants for Glory, Virtue nurst by war, That, some amongst them to their neighbours turn Not for their neighbour's notice but their king's. Hymmeus was present, of Milesian race, But he disdain'd his country, and preferr'd One struggling hard with tyranny, to one Where power o'er slaves was freedom and was rights, Nor man degraded could but man degrade. The harp, his sorrow's solace, he resumed, Whose gently agitating liquid airs Melted the wayward shadow of disgrace, And, bearing highly up his well-stored heart Above the vulgar, bade him cherish Pride.— Mother of virtues to the virtuous man, Her brilliant heavenly-temper'd ornaments Tarnish to blackness at the touch of vice. Sometimes the sadly quivering soul-struck wires Threw a pale lustre on his native shore; When suddenly the sound “Conspirator,” How harsh from those we serve and those we love!— Burst with insulting blow the enchanting strain, And the fair vision vanish'd into air. The pleasant solitude of sunny beach, The yellow bank scoopt out with idle hands, And near, white birds, and further naked boys, That o'er the level of the lustrous sand, Like kindred broods, seem ready to unite, The tempest whirls away,—and where they stood Up starts a monster, that, with hiss and howl, Seizes the wretch who runs to loose its chains. When Arganthonius saw him, he exclaim'd “Hymneus! and thou too here! thy glowing words Could once, arousing in the warrior's breast Enthusiastic rage, sublime the soul So far above the rocks where Danger broods, That she and all her monstrous progeny Groveling, and breathing fire, and shadow-winged, Become invisible.—O thou of power With magic tones Affliction to disarm! Thou canst conjure up fury, call down hope, Or whisper comfort, or inspire revenge. Rise! trace the wanderings of thy comrades, shew What men, relying on the Gods, can bear.” He ended here, and Hymneus thus began. Long has Tartessus left her fertile fields, And but by forest beast or mountain bird, Seen from afar her flocks lie unconsumed; The maids of Sidon, and the maids of Tyre To whom proud streams thro' marble arches bend, Still bid the spindle urge its whirring flight And waft to wealth the luxury of our woes. Thus without lassitude barbaric kings Shall midst their revels read our history; And thou too, warm to fancy, warm to grief, In hall and arbour, shade and solitude, Whose bosom rises at the faintest breath From dizzy tower, dark dungeon, stormy rock, But rises not, nor moves, to public pangs— Woman! our well-wrought anguish shalt admire! And toy-taught children overtake our flight. But we have conquer'd:—hear me valiant youth! Untired and pressing for the course; O hear Ye fires, whom stormy life's vicissitudes At length have driven on no hostile shore, O hear me, nor repine; but cherish hope, And fortune will return and cherish you. We utter'd soothing words from sickening hearts, And with firm voice in flight and rout proclaim'd, That we would never yield, would never fly: While thus, revived by confidence, they rose, Fortune gave weight to fancy's golden dreams, And more than hope dare promise time perform'd. Thus from some desert rock which every tide Drenches and deluges, the mariner Marks the uneven surges rolling, marks The black pods rattling as the wave retires,— And now another!—high he folds his arms, He groans, looks earnest on, and is resign'd. Danger and safety this dread interval Brings close; the billow self-suspended hangs; The tide had reach'd its highest, and has ebbed: While distant, now appearing, now unseen, His comrades struggle up the fluited surge, Their strength, their voices, wreckt! the spring approach'd; The fields and woods were vocal with the joy Of birds that twittering from the thin-leav'd broom Or close laurustin, or the sumach-tufts Gay, nest-like, meditated nought but love. Ah! happy far beyond man's happiness, Who ever saw them wander o'er the waves For guilty gold, or shiver on the shore For life-wrung purple to array their breasts? Theirs cherish, ours repudiate, chaste desire! In vain was nature gay; in vain the flocks With fond parental bleatings filled the fold; In vain the brindled heifer lowed content To crop the shining herbage, or to browze The tender maple in the twilight dell. Cold, O ye flocks and herds the hand will be That fed ye, cold the hand that sweetly tuned Its pipe to call ye to your nightly home, Or gave the feebler dog encouragement To drive the wolf away! vain care—the wretch Who slew your shepherd, at the altar's horn Slays you to celebrate his victory. The Tyrians now approach; a thousand oars Heave with impatient sweep the whitening surge To seize Tartessus in the noon of peace. The very zephyr now, that cool'd our coast, Plays in the bosom of their sail, and smooths Each rising billow; never more appall'd The hand that cultivates Vesuvio's slope, When with dull dash the fiery tide o'erflows The pumice that surrounds his humble cot, Than was Tartessus. Olpis first espied The naval host advancing; now delay Were death;—he loosen'd the relaying rope From his left elbow, and the toils above Dropt sounding on the surface of the waves. He ran; nor enter'd he the city gate Ere, interrupted oft, by haste, and fear, In accents loud and shrill he thus began. “Fly, fly, what madness holds you in your streets? The Tyrians are behind; they climb the rocks Light and unnumber'd as the brooding gulls.— O fly, Tartessians! not a hope remains.” Incontinent, the noisy streets are fill'd With young alike and old; the mother runs To save her children, playing in the court, Improvident of ill, and grasps their wrist, Hurrying them onward till they weep and ask “For what?” and whining plead the promised hour, Now threaten loud, and now again in tears. No more the murmuring labour of the loom Detains the virgin, who, with patient hand, But fluttering heart, the whitest vesture wove For him she loved so tenderly, for him Who soon arising from the nuptial couch, Would scatter mid the warbling wanton choir The lavish nuts, would hear their bland adieu, And seize the pleasures they were taught to sing. Here were the fathers sitting; they were seen To wave their tremulous hand, and bid them go Whose life is green and vigorous, “for you The sun will ripen many vintages, But we are prone to tarry, cruel Tyre Scarcely can drag the dying in her chains.” The throbs of urgent terror now subside In all, and every one his earnest arms With pious anguish throws around them, prays To lead them into refuge, prays to strow The bed of age, and close the beamless eye. Alas! too confident in hoary hairs God's gift, but not God's blessing—they refuse The proffer'd kindness; and their parted limbs Hung upon hooks, with patriot gore distain'd The walls they once defended! ah! thy day Rolls on; a victim to the very sword Thyself unsheathest, I behold thee fall; Nor help in any near—that help, O Tyre! Blind to the future, why hast thou destroyed? Were it not better to extend the hand T'ward rising states, than proudly crush them? realms Which stand on ruins insecurely stand. But wherefore turn our eyes to other climes Which fate has frown'd on! tho' her frowns I dread, I deem it first of human miseries To be a tyrant, then to suffer one. 'Tis true we left our city, left our fields, O'er naked flints we travell'd, and review'd What once we held so dear: the eye of youth Saw, tho' the tear would often intervene, And shake their branches, and suspend their bowers, The groves that echoed to his horn or waved With gales that whilom whisper'd notes of love: He saw; and linger'd long; for seldom fear Invades a bosom harbouring regret. But others hasten'd to the far-off heights Of Calpè: there a hundred grottoes gleam High-arct with massy spear; from hence descend Columns of crystal, ranged from side to side In equal order; there the freshest Nymphs Bring water sweet and glide away unseen. But hither few arrive, now darkness reigns Around; but weary of the slow-paced hours One lifts his eyes above, and, trembling, views The moss and ivy shake with every wind Against the yawning cavern; every wind He deems a spectre's yell; and every beam Shed from the clouded orbit stops his flight. One, when molested from their lone abode The birds of omen rise aloft in air, Shrill-shrieking, and on whirring pinion borne Sidelong, and circling o'er the pinnacles, In turbid agitation thinks he hears His infant faintly wailing, or his wife From far, imploring help he cannot give; And wishes he were dead, yet fears to die. 'Twere piteous now, had pity past ourselves, To hear sometimes the long-drawn moan of dogs, Sometimes their quick impatience, while they sought Fond master, left behind, or headlong dash'd Where faithless moonshine fill'd the abrupt abyss. From waken'd nest, and pinion silence-pois'd, Th' huge vulture drops rebounding;—first he fears; Looks round; draws back; half lifts his cow'ring wing; Stretches his ruffled neck and rolling eye, Tastes the warm blood, and flickers for the foe. Some, seated on the soft declivity, Sink into weary slumber; others climb The crumbling cliff, and craggy precipice, To none accessible but him who fears. Thus, to the mountain-brake that overhangs A valley dark and narrow, flies the kid Before a lion: he from far espies The pensile fugitive, nor dares pursue; But gazing often, with tremendous roar Shakes from his thirsty throat the fretful foam. Here, love, ambition, labor, victory, Injustice, vengeance, Hercules forgot. Forgot how proud Laomedon, from Troy's High summits, knew the hero, knew the steeds That paw'd the plain beneath, and all the king Shrunk, and the perjurer alone remain'd. Here mournful Thessaly no more occurr'd, Deserted by her shepherds, while the neck Of roving oxen soften'd from the yoke. Here hospitable Scyros he forgot; Here Tempé, fresh with springs, with woods embower'd; Larissa too, whose glowing children vied In pæans, vied in tracing where the throng Around the quiver, markt the hand, of strength To lift on high the shafts of Hercules. While thro' the bulrushes the hero stept, Slow, and intently looking round him, waved His torch, and blue-eyed Lerna, lily-crowned, Shook at the shadow of a future God. 'Twas there he started, matchless in the race; The race was run; and Calpé was the goal. 'Twas here Tartessus, in distraction fled Before the steel of Sidon; she with Tyre Unfurl'd the sail of conquest, Oceans rose To waft her, suns to strow the yielding way. Hers were the realms of night—each star was hers. But Venus far above the rest, whose orb's Meek lustre, melting thro' the cedar-sprays That spire around the lofty Lebanon, Led forth their matrons all at evening's close To celebrate the sad solemnity. There they abided: here, ill-omen'd hour! Aside Lacippo's stream, with boughs o'erhung, Dark alder, pearly-blossom'd arbutus, And myrtle, highest held of earthly flowers, And mixt with amaranth at the feasts above— Maids snowy-stoled, and purple-mitred boys, Foregoing each young pleasure—mazy dance, Where Love most but most slightly wounds, Games, where Contention strives to look like Love, Scatter anemones, and roses, torn Ere daylight wakes them, from their mossy cell. Not thus, Nebrissa, went thy mountaineers. Mad with religious lust and solemn wine, They panted for their orgies, at the fount Accustom'd: part the mangled heifer tear; Part, stamping on the neck, wrench off its brow The horns, and blow them bubbling hoarse with blood: Some gird themselves with adders: others yell From pipe far-screeching—trill above their head The tymbrel—clash the cymbal—others drum The hollow deep-toned Corybantine brass. Before them, Sycus and Amphyllion, Glad to have mixt themselves with men, at hours When fearful childhood is constrain'd to rest, Ran tripping for Lacippo; but to see Flowers that profusely floated down the stream, Breaking the yellow moonshine as they passed, Surprised and held them; fixt on this, they heard No plaintive strain beyond: for childhood's mind Sits on the eyeball; 'tis her boundary. But, higher up, those who the orgies led Hearken'd, at every pause, and each was fill'd With clear responses winding thro' the vale. Old Cheratægon chided this delay. “Why stood they gaping? had the wrathful Moon Struck them? had any Satyr from the heights, Had he whom every Season stops to crown, Whom Hellespontic Lampsacus adores, Answered their carols, kind? if so—reply.” Then placing to his lips the clarion, He started, waved it round, and listening Again, cried out “a female voice I hear, “Proceed, proceed.” They hurry on; they view The choir: the shrieking damsels cannot fly; Their vesture baffles each attempt of fear. In vain implore they Venus, and adjure By all she suffer'd when Adonis died, The rustics knew Adonis not by name Nor Venus by a tear. They wring their hands In agony, they clasp them in despair, Or those restricted in the strong embrace, Raise praying eyes to heaven, and bend the neck Back till, its tapering column quite convulsed, The breasts that from the marble sanctuary Stood out inviting Chastity and Love, By violence and passion are profaned. While tumult rages there and wild affright, Led by avenging deities, and warm'd With patriot fire, the purest that ascends Before the presence of those deities, The caverns we had left, and many a plain As desolate, where now the wolf, enraged, Bit the deserted fences of the fold; And now with plighted faith and pledging vows Throughout invoke our murder'd countrymen: For now at las the radiant host of heaven Seem'd, going one by one, to delegate Peace and repose behind; these oft enchant The wicked; but whene'er the weary lids Drop, either dreadful visions they enclose, Tenacious, or the senseless breast imbibes The poison'd balm of sweet security. Seen through that porch's pillars, yonder wood Tho' not far distant, yet from hence appears More like a grassy slope—by Lybian blasts Distorted—there in ambush, we surveyed Our battlements, whose friendly shadow stretch'd O'er half the ruins of old Geryon's tomb: When silently and quick athwart the dale Glide ranks of helmets; these alone are seen, Darkness and distance occupy the rest. They fade away, and eagerly we catch The rumour of their march: the hunter, worn With service dragging some ignoble weight, Stops in the passing wind the well-known cry Of hound that, after hard-run chase hath leapt Up to his nostrils, or against his side Rested one foot—the other gall'd with thorns— Like him we, conscious of our former strength, Quake with the impotence of wild desire. Less dangerous now is our determined course Toward Tartessus: we approach the walls; We reach them; nor had halted, ere the gates Fly open: staring at the prodigy, Encouraged at the fact, the Iberian bands Rush in, and with a dreadful shout proclaim The vengeance of the Gods; afraid to strike At first, lest any one of these, conceal'd In human likeness, at the portal placed, The force, himself inspired them with, bewail. Astounded and aghast, the Tyrians rise From slumber: these imagine it a dream, Discrediting their senses' evidence; Those in the portico cry out to arms, Forgetful of their own, while many, driven By desperation, reckless of their shield Or buckler, rush amidst us, sword in hand, Impetuous, covering with their prostrate corse The spot they fought on: others, overthrown By numbers pressing forward, under throngs Of enemies, groan loud; a double pang Such feel, in dying with no hostile wound. Hundreds and fortunate are they, prolong Sleep into death, nor ever know the change. The remnant in their hollow ships confide For refuge, close pursued; thrice happy few Who now, the pitchy, hard, and slippery side Surmounted, mindless yet of sail or oar, Embrace their own Patæcus on the prow. O'er their companions, in the crowded strand Death, leading up night's rear, her banner waves, Invisible, but rustling like the blast That strips the fallen year: with arms outstretched, Dismay, before her, pushes on; and Fear Crouching unconscious close beside her casts A murky paleness o'er her wing black-plumed. Just liberated from their noisome cells, Slavery's devoted, thirsting for revenge, Drink deep; the fetter is at last become An instrument of slaughter, and the feet Swoln with it bathe themselves in hostile blood, Till from the valleys deep the fogs arise Perceptible; while on the summits Morn Her saffron robe and golden sceptre lays. Then of their lofty vessels we descry Nought save the topmost sails, each nether part By Gades, tho' behind them, was obscured; These, distant yet, seem'd o'er the town displayed. 'Tis painful, O Phocæans, to unfold The brazen gates of War, and find Revenge Bursting her brittle manacles, while Rage Strikes with impatient spear the sounding floor. Here Sycus and Amphyllion I behold, Shivering, and with the back of feeble wrist Drawn frequently across their swollen eyes, Wiping large tears away—poor harmless pair! You, playing near life's threshold strown with flowers, Common indeed, but sweet, and all your own, Death snatcht away, and flapt her raven wing. The Tyrians sally forth, to meet the hour When woe and darkness yield to light and glee, And reach Lacippo's fount ere earliest dawn. No mortal meet they, nor the faintest noise Hear, but of rustling leaves and tinkling rill. They wonder; look around them; shudder, seize Each zephyr, and each shadow which he makes By nimbly lighting on the pliant boughs Creep further on the grass: for every man Imagines, tho' all others may have strayed, Surely his own must near him still remain. But all upon the distant hills were drag'd Thro' wild and winding sheep-walks, into huts Where with unsated eye Nebrissan wives, Not yet suspicious of supplanting charms, Survey their strange attire: one draws the veil Aside, and fancies somewhat in the face Tho' foreign like her countrywomen; lips Rosy, but rather blighted; eyes full-orbed, Ringlets that o'er pellucid temples wave, As cedars o'er steep snow-drifts; blooming cheeks, But, courted not by sun or sea-born gale, Pallid and puny when compared with hers: Another, hath some broken flower escaped Mid the dishevel'd hair, with curious hand Twists round, on tiptoe, its exotic stem, Exulting high with ingenuity. The Tyrians now, disconsolate, unite In counsel: each one differs in the way To follow, each his neighbour's choice amends. When on the pathway haply one espied A torch; he whirl'd, he kindled it; he sware By earth and heaven 'twas happy; he exclaim'd “We too will sacrifice! Revenge be ours! Revenge is worthy to succeed to Love. Each irresistible, immortal each, Not blind—the wretch feigns that—their pupils roll In fire unquenchable: Persuasion form'd Their lips, and raptured at their lively hue She kist her new creation; hence delight Breathes through the thirsting fibres of the breast, Like honey from Dodona's prophet-grove, Sweet and inspiring too—Revenge, revenge.” Silence dwelt shortly with them, ere he touched This jarring nerve; when suddenly their hearts Vibrated into dreadful unison. They gape upon him, gathering from his breath (As manna from the desert men would seize) The substance of their wishes; they demand In sentences imperfect, how to grasp The phantom set before them, whispering With eager but with hesitating haste Together and awaiting no reply: Nay, often an enquiry that commenced With one concluded in another's ear. They moved; the crowd seem'd growing: swift they strode Toward the streamlet, thither where it spread, Wider, and (as upon its bosom fell The frigid, iron-color'd, unripe light) Just trembled: here the boy Amphyllion Stood waiting for the broken garlands, borne No farther by the current; forward lean'd The busy idler, under where he stood Sweeping them gently on with willow wand. He thought, full sure he thought—such eagerness His one protended and one poising hand, Half-open lips, and steady lustrous eyes, Show'd plainly—safe arrived ere others woke, To deck his mother's door, and be forgiven. Sycus more weary, on his arm inclined, Sat peevish by, and, often of the way Complaining, yet unwilling to arise, Bit acid sorrels from their juicy stalk. “Lo yonder!” he exclaim'd, “the morning dawns Among the junipers, and ill forebodes Beside such dampness when no dew has fallen— This bursting glare, while all around is shade. Can it be morning? No; there mornings rise: It is not morning; and the moon is gone; It cannot be the moon.” Too rightly judged Poor Sycus; nearer now flashed redder light Than rising moons give reapers going home; Now nearer, and now nearer yet, approach'd Voices and armour glimmer'd thro' the glade; Next, helmets were distinguisht; lastly, vests Black afar off, their proper crimson shew'd. They tremble at the sight, and deadly drops Trickle down ankles white as ivory. Pity and mercy they implore—the soul Presages ere it reasons—they implore Pity and mercy, ere the enemy's hand Seizes them, ere, in painful bondage bent, Behind them hang so helplessly their own. Uprooted smells the hazel underwood, The verdant pile ascends; upon the top Branches of pitch-tree are arranged, across, And cover'd with their leaves: the cymbals ring; The tymbrels rough, and doubling drums reply. Music, when thunders arm her heavenly voice, May rouse most other passions—she may rouse The Furies from their deep Tartarian dens, Or Wonder from her unseen orbit, fixt The middlemost of endless myriads— Terror she stops amid his wild career, Engages and subdues. Amphyllion's heart Flutter'd indeed but flutter'd less confined, He trembled more, yet dreaded less: the boy Would now with rapturous violence have rubbed His palms to sparkling, were they but unbound, His head he would have nestled in the lap Of Fortune, when he found the budded spoils Lie innocent, squared well, and garland-hung. He laughed at their device; he look'd around, And saw the knife, but sought the sacrifice. Can yon ethereal Powers! if any rule Above us or below, or if concern For human sins and sorrows touches you— Can you see, quivering, shrinking, shrivelling, Lips without guile, and bosoms without gall, Nor pity, succour, save! Alas, your will Was pleaded, and your presence was invoked. First, 'twas revenge—but, when 'twas done, 'twas heaven! When others rise in anger, men exclaim “Fierce Furies urge them:” but when they themselves, “Righteous inflexible Eumenides.” Even thou Venus! Goddess! even thou, That leadest the Gætulian lioness From caves and carnage, and on sunny sands Makest to slumber with satiety— Thou wreathest serpents as thou wreathest flowers, Thou silencest the winds without a word, Thou curbest the black Tempest; and the face Of Ocean brightens at thy filial smile, Yet, either art thou cruel or profaned. When Cruelty and Youth together dwell Nature may weep indeed! they also wept. The sons of Tyre and Sidon also wept. Returning to the gates, they only heard A few last groans, only a few fond names Given them long ago: by madness driven, Like Atys, when he left his father's home, Never to see it more, nor to admire His face dim-shining from his olived thigh— They run into the woods and are devour'd By grief and famine, without friend or grave. CHRYSAOR. Come, I beseech ye, Muses! who, retired Deep in the shady glens by Helicon, Yet know the realms of Ocean, know the laws Of his wide empire, and throughout his court Know every Nymph, and call them each by name; Who from your sacred mountain see afar O'er earth and heaven, and hear and memorise The crimes of men and counsels of the Gods; Sing of those crimes and of those counsels, sing Of Gades sever'd from the fruitful main, And what befell, and from what mighty hand, Chrysaor, wielder of the golden sword. 'Twas when the high Olympus shook with fear, Lest all his temples, all his groves, be crusht By Pelion piled on Ossa: but the sire Of mortals and immortals waved his arm Around, and all below was wild dismay: Again, 'twas agony: again, 'twas peace. Chrysaor still in Gades tarrying, Hurl'd into ether, tinging, as it flew, With sudden fire the clouds round Saturn's throne, No pine surrendered by retreating Pan, Nor ash, nor poplar pale: but swoln with pride Stood towering from the citadel; his spear One hand was rested on, and one with rage Shut hard, and firmly fixt against his side; His frowning visage, flusht with insolence, Rais'd up oblique to heaven. “O thou,” he cried, “Whom nations kneel to, not whom nations know, Hear me, and answer, if indeed thou canst, The last appeal I deign thee or allow. Tell me, and quickly, why should I adore, Adored myself by millions? why invoke, Invoked with all thy attributes? Men wrong By their prostrations, prayers, and sacrifice, Either the Gods, their rulers, or themselves: But flame and thunder fright them from the Gods; Themselves they can not, dare not, they are ours; Us, dare they, can they, us? But triumph, Jove! Man for one moment hath engaged his lord, Henceforth let merchants value him, not kings. No! lower thy sceptre, and hear Atrobal, And judge aright to whom men sacrifice. ‘My children,’ said the sage and pious priest, ‘Mark there the altar! though the fumes aspire Twelve cubits ere a nostril they regale, 'Tis myrrh for Titans, 'tis but air for Gods.’ Time changes, Nature changes, I am changed! Fronting the furious lustre of the sun, I yielded to his piercing swift-shot beams Only when quite meridan, then abased These orbits to the ground, and there survey'd My shadow: strange and horrid to relate! My very shadow almost disappear'd! Restore it, or by earth and hell I swear With blood enough will I refascinate The cursed incantation: thou restore, And largely; or my brethren, all combined, Shall rouse thee from thy lethargies, and drive Far from thy cloud-soft pillow, minion-prest, Those leering lassitudes that follow Love.” The smile of disappointment and disdain Sat sallow on his pausing lip half-closed; But, neither headlong importunity Nor gibing threat of reed-propt insolence Let loose the blast of vengeance: heaven shone bright, And proud Chrysaor spurn'd the prostrate land. But the triumphant Thunderer, now mankind (Criminal mostly for enduring crimes) Provoked his indignation, thus besought His trident-sceptred brother, triton-borne. “O Neptune! cease henceforward to repine. They are not cruel, no; the Destinies Intent upon their loom, unoccupied With aught beyond its moody murmuring sound, Will neither see thee weep nor hear thee sigh: And wherefore weep, O Neptune, wherefore sigh! Ambition? 'tis unworthy of a God, Unworthy of a brother! I am Jove, Thou Neptune: happier in uncitied realms, In coral hall or grotto samphire-ceil'd, Amid the song of Nymphs and ring of shells Thou smoothest at thy will the pliant wave Or liftest it to heaven. I also can Whatever best beseems me, nor for aid Unless I loved thee, Neptune, would I call. Though absent, thou hast heard and hast beheld The profanation of that monstrous race, That race of earth-born giants; one survives; The rapid-footed Rhodan mountain-rear'd Beheld the rest defeated; still remain Scatter'd throughout interminable fields, Sandy and sultry, and each hopeless path Choakt up with crawling briars and bristling thorns, The flinty trophies of their foul disgrace. Chrysaor, wielder of the golden sword, Still hails as brethren men of stouter heart, But, wise confederate, shuns Phlegræan fields. No warrior he, yet who so fond of war, Unfeeling, scarce ferocious; flattery's dupe, He fancies that the Gods themselves are his; Impious, but most in prayer. Now re-assert Thy friendship, raise thy trident, strike the rock, Sever him from mankind.” Then thus replied The Nymph-surrounded monarch of the main. “Empire bemoan I not, however shared, Nor Fortune frail, nor stubborn Fate, accuse: No! mortals I bemoan! when Avarice, Ploughing these fruitless furrows, shall awake The basking Demons and the dormant Crimes, Horrible, strong, resistless, and transform Meekness to Madness, Patience to Despair. What is Ambition? what but Avarice? But Avarice in richer guise array'd, Stalking erect, loud-spoken, lion-mien'd, Her brow uncrost by care, but deeply markt, And darting downward 'twixt her eyes hard-lasht The wrinkle of command. Could ever I So foul a fiend, so fondly too, caress? Judge me not harshly, judge me by my deeds.” Though seated then on Afric's further coast, Yet sudden at his voice, so long unheard, (For he had grieved and treasured up his grief) With short kind greeting meet from every side The Triton herds, and warm with melody The azure concave of their curling shells. Swift as an arrow, as the wind, as light, He glided through the deep, and now arrived, Leapt from his pearly beryl-studded car. Earth trembled: the retreating tide, black-brow'd Gather'd new strength, and rushing on, assail'd The promontory's base: but when the God Himself, resistless Neptune, struck one blow, Rent were the rocks asunder, and the sky Was darken'd with their fragments ere they fell. Lygeia vocal, Zantho yellow-hair'd, Spio with sparkling eyes, and Beroe Demure, and sweet Ione, youngest-born, Of mortal race, but grown divine by song. Had ye seen playing round her placid neck The sunny circles, braidless and unbound, O! who had call'd them boders of a storm! These, and the many sister Nereids, Forgetful of their lays and of their loves, All unsuspicious of the dread intent, Stop suddenly their gambols, and with shrieks Of terror plunge amid the closing wave; Yet, just above, one moment more appear Their darken'd tresses floating in the foam. Thrown prostrate on the earth, the Sacrilege Rais'd up his head astounded, and accurst The stars, the destinies, the gods; his breast Panted from consternation and dismay, And pride untoward on himself o'erthrown. From his distended nostrils issued gore At intervals, wherewith his wiry locks, Huge arms, and bulky bosom, shone beslimed: And thrice he call'd his brethren, with a voice More dismal than the blasts from Phlegethon Below, that urge along ten thousand ghosts Wafted loud-wailing o'er the fiery tide. But answer heard he none: the men of might Who gather'd round him formerly, the men Whom frozen at a frown, a smile revived, Were far: enormous mountains interposed, Nor ever had the veil-hung pine out-spred O'er Tethys then her wandering leafless shade: Nor could he longer under winter stars Suspend the watery journey nor repose Whole nights on Ocean's billowy restless bed; No longer, bulging through the tempest, rose That bulky bosom; nor those oarlike hands, Trusted ere mortal's keenest ken conceived The bluest shore, threw back opposing tides. Shrunken mid brutal hair his violent veins Subsided, yet were hideous to behold As dragons panting in the noontide brake. At last, absorbing deep the breath of heaven, And stifling all within his deadly grasp, Struggling and tearing up the glebe to turn, And from a throat that, as it throbb'd and rose, Seem'd shaking ponderous links of dusky iron, Uttering one anguish-forced indignant groan, Fired with infernal rage, the spirit flew. Nations of fair Hesperia! lo, o'erthrown Your peace-embracing war-inciting king! Ah! thrice twelve years and longer ye endured, Without one effort to rise higher, one hope That heaven would wing the secret shaft aright, The abomination: hence 'twas Jove's command That many hundred, many thousand more, Freed from one despot, yet from one unfreed, Ye crouch unblest at Superstition's feet. Her hath he sent among ye; her the pest Of men below and curse of Gods above: Hers are the last, worst tortures they inflict On all who bend to any king but them. Born of Sicanus in the vast abyss Where never light descended, she survived Her parent; he omnipotence defied, But thunderstruck fell headlong from the clouds; She, though the radiant ether overpower'd Her eyes, accustom'd to the gloom of night, And quencht their lurid orbs, Religion's helm Assuming, vibrated her Stygian torch, Till thou, Astræa! though behind the sire's Broad egis, trembledst on thy heavenly throne. REGENERATION. We are what suns and winds and waters make us; The mountains are our sponsors, and the rills Fashion and win their nursling with their smiles. But where the land is dim from tyranny, Their tiny pleasures occupy the place Of glories and of duties; as the feet Of fabled fairies when the sun goes down Trip o'er the grass where wrestlers strove by day. Then Justice, call'd the Eternal One above, Is more inconstant than the buoyant form That burst into existence from the froth Of ever-varying ocean: what is best Then becomes worst; what loveliest, most deformed. The heart is hardest in the softest climes, The passions flourish, the affections die. O thou vast tablet of these awful truths, That fillest all the space between the seas, Spreading from Venice's deserted courts To the Tarentine and Hydruntine mole, What lifts thee up? what shakes thee? 'tis the breath Of God. Awake, ye nations! spring to life! Let the last work of his right hand appear Fresh with his image, Man. Thou recreant slave That sittest afar off and helpest not, O thou degenerate Albion! with what shame Do I survey thee, pushing forth the spunge At thy spear's length, in mockery at the thirst Of holy Freedom in his agony, And prompt and keen to pierce the wounded side! Must Italy then wholly rot away Amid her slime, before she germinate Into fresh vigour, into form again? What thunder bursts upon mine ear! some isle Hath surely risen from the gulphs profound, Eager to suck the sunshine from the breast Of beauteous Nature, and to catch the gale From golden Hermus and Melena's brow. A greater thing than isle, than continent, Than earth itself, than ocean circling earth, Hath risen there; regenerate Man hath risen. Generous old bard of Chios! not that Jove Deprived thee in thy latter days of sight Would I complain, but that no higher theme Than a disdainful youth, a lawless king, A pestilence, a pyre, awoke thy song, When on the Chian coast, one javelin's throw From where thy tombstone, where thy cradle stood, Twice twenty self-devoted Greeks assail'd The naval host of Asia, at one blow Scattered it into air . . . and Greece was free . . . And ere these glories beam'd, thy day had closed. Let all that Elis ever saw, give way, All that Olympian Jove e'er smiled upon: The Marathonian columns never told A tale more glorious, never Salamis, Nor, faithful in the centre of the false, Platea, nor Anthela, from whose mount Benignant Ceres wards the blessed Laws, And sees the Amphictyon dip his weary foot In the warm streamlet of the strait below. Goddess! altho' thy brow was never rear'd Among the powers that guarded or assail'd Perfidious Ilion, parricidal Thebes, Or other walls whose war-belt e'er inclosed Man's congregated crimes and vengeful pain, Yet hast thou toucht the extremes of grief and joy; Grief upon Enna's mead and Hell's ascent, A solitary mother; joy beyond, Far beyond, that thy woe, in this thy fane: The tears were human, but the bliss divine. I, in the land of strangers, and deprest With sad and certain presage for my own, Exult at hope's fresh dayspring, tho' afar, There where my youth was not unexercised By chiefs in willing war and faithful song: Shades as they were, they were not empty shades, Whose bodies haunt our world and blear our sun, Obstruction worse than swamp and shapeless sands. Peace, praise, eternal gladness, to the souls That, rising from the seas into the heavens, Have ransom'd first their country with their blood! O thou immortal Spartan! at whose name The marble table sounds beneath my palms, Leonidas! even thou wilt not disdain To mingle names august as these with thine; Nor thou, twin-star of glory, thou whose rays Stream'd over Corinth on the double sea, Achaian and Saronic; whom the sons Of Syracuse, when Death removed thy light, Wept more than slavery ever made them weep, But shed (if gratitude is sweet) sweet tears . . The hand that then pour'd ashes o'er their heads Was loosen'd from its desperate chain by thee. What now can press mankind into one mass, For Tyranny to tread the more secure? From gold alone is drawn the guilty wire That Adulation trills: she mocks the tone Of Duty, Courage, Virtue, Piety, And under her sits Hope. O how unlike That graceful form in azure vest array'd, With brow serene, and eyes on heaven alone In patience fixt, in fondness unobscured! What monsters coil beneath the spreading tree Of Despotism! what wastes extend around! What poison floats upon the distant breeze! But who are those that cull and deal its fruit? Creatures that shun the light and fear the shade, Bloated and fierce, Sleep's mien and Famine's cry. Rise up again, rise in thy dignity, Dejected Man! and scare this brood away. TO CORINTH. Queen of the double sea, beloved of him Who shakes the world's foundations, thou hast seen Glory in all her beauty, all her forms; Seen her walk back with Theseus when he left The bones of Sciron bleaching to the wind, Above the ocean's roar and cormorant's flight, So high that vastest billows from above Show but like herbage waving in the mead; Seen generations throng thy Isthmian games, And pass away; the beautiful, the brave, And them who sang their praises. But, O Queen, Audible still, and far beyond thy cliffs, As when they first were utter'd, are those words Divine which praised the valiant and the just; And tears have often stopt, upon that ridge So perilous, him who brought before his eye The Colchian babes. “Stay! spare him! save the last! Medea! Is that blood? again! it drops From my imploring hand upon my feet! I will invoke the Eumenides no more, I will forgive thee, bless thee, bend to thee In all thy wishes, do but thou, Medea, Tell me, one lives.” “And shall I too deceive?” Cries from the fiery car an angry voice; And swifter than two falling stars descend, Two breathless bodies; warm, soft, motionless, As flowers in stillest noon before the sun, They lie three paces from him: such they lie As when he left them sleeping side by side, A mother's arm round each, a mother's cheeks Between them, flusht with happiness and love. He was more changed than they were, doomed to show Thee and the stranger, how defaced and scarr'd Grief hunts us down the precipice of years, And whom the faithless prey upon the last. To give the inertest masses of our earth Her loveliest forms, was thine; to fix the Gods Within thy walls, and hang their tripods round With fruits and foliage knowing not decay. A nobler work remains: thy citadel Invites all Greece: o'er lands and floods remote Many are the hearts that still beat high for thee: Confide then in thy strength, and unappall'd Look down upon the plain, while yokemate kings Run bellowing where their herdsmen goad them on. Instinct is sharp in them and terror true, They smell the floor whereon their necks must lie. POEMS AND EPIGRAMS CHIEFLY FROM THE COLLECTION OF 1846. [O friends! who have accompanied thus far] O friends! who have accompanied thus far My quickening steps, sometimes where sorrow sate Dejected, and sometimes where valour stood Resplendent, right before us; here perhaps We best might part; but one to valour dear Comes up in wrath and calls me worse than foe Reminding me of gifts too ill deserved. I must not blow away the flowers he gave, Altho' now faded; I must not efface The letters his own hand has traced for me. Here terminates my park of poetry. Look out no longer for extensive woods, For clusters of unlopt and lofty trees, With stately animals coucht under them, Or grottoes with deep wells of water pure, And ancient figures in the solid rock: Come, with our sunny pasture be content, Our narrow garden and our homestead croft, And tillage not neglected. Love breathes round; Love, the bright atmosphere, the vital air, Of youth; without it life and death are one. I. [She leads in solitude her youthful hours] She leads in solitude her youthful hours, Her nights are restlessness, her days are pain. O when will Health and Pleasure come again, Adorn her brow and strew her path with flowers, And wandering wit relume the roseate bowers, And turn and trifle with his festive train? Grant me, O grant this wish, ye heavenly Powers! All other hope, all other wish, restrain. II. [Come back, ye Smiles, that late forsook] Come back, ye Smiles, that late forsook Each breezy path and ferny nook. Come Laughter, though the Sage hath said Thou favourest most the thoughtless head: I blame thee not, howe'er inclin'd To love the vacant easy mind, But now am ready, may it please, That mine be vacant and at ease. Sweet children of celestial breed, Be ruled by me; repress your speed. Laughter! though Momus gave thee birth, And said, My darling, stay on earth! Smiles! though from Venus you arise, And live for ever in the skies, Softly! and let not one descend But first alights upon my friend. When one upon her cheek appears, A thousand spring to life from hers; Death smites his disappointed urn, And spirit, pleasure, wit, return. III. WITH PETRARCA'S SONNETS. Behold what homage to his idol paid The tuneful suppliant of Valclusa's shade. Often his lively fancy tried to cheat Passion's fixed gaze with some assumed conceit, Often behind the mould'ring columns stood, And often darted from the laureate wood. His verses still the tender heart engage, They charmed a rude, and please a polisht age: Some are to nature and to passion true, And all had been so, had he lived for you. IV. [The touch of Love dispels the gloom] The touch of Love dispels the gloom Of life, and animates the tomb; But never let it idly flare On gazers in the open air, Nor turn it quite away from one To whom it serves for moon and sun, And who alike in night and day Without it could not find his way. V. TWELFTH-NIGHT. I draw with trembling hand my doubtful lot; Yet where are Fortune's frowns if she frown not From whom I hope, from whom I fear, the kiss? O gentle Love! if there be aught beyond That makes the bosom calm, but leaves it fond, O let her give me that, and take back this! VI. [She I love (alas in vain!)] She I love (alas in vain!) Floats before my slumbering eyes: When she comes she lulls my pain, When she goes what pangs arise! Thou whom love, whom memory flies, Gentle Sleep! prolong thy reign! If even thus she soothe my sighs, Never let me wake again! VII. [Thou hast not rais'd, Ianthe, such desire] Thou hast not rais'd, Ianthe, such desire In any breast as thou hast rais'd in mine. No wandering meteor now, no marshy fire, Leads on my steps, but lofty, but divine: And, if thou chillest me, as chill thou dost When I approach too near, too boldly gaze, So chills the blushing morn, so chills the host Of vernal stars, with light more chaste than day's. VIII. [Darling shell, where hast thou been] Darling shell, where hast thou been, West or East? or heard or seen? From what pastimes art thou come? Can we make amends at home? Whether thou hast tuned the dance To the maids of ocean Know I not; but Ignorance Never hurts Devotion. This I know, Ianthe's shell, I must ever love thee well, Tho' too little to resound While the Nereids dance around: For, of all the shells that are, Thou art sure the brightest; Thou, Ianthe's infant care, Most these eyes delightest. To thy early aid she owes Teeth like budding snowdrop rows: And what other shell can say On her bosom once it lay? That which into Cyprus bore Venus from her native sea, (Pride of shells!) was never more Dear to her than thou to me. IX. [Away my verse; and never fear] Away my verse; and never fear, As men before such beauty do; On you she will not look severe, She will not turn her eyes from you. Some happier graces could I lend That in her memory you should live, Some little blemishes might blend, For it would please her to forgive. X. [Pleasure! why thus desert the heart] Pleasure! why thus desert the heart In its spring-tide? I could have seen her, I could part, And but have sigh'd! O'er every youthful charm to stray, To gaze, to touch . . Pleasure! why take so much away, Or give so much! XI. [My hopes retire; my wishes as before] My hopes retire; my wishes as before Struggle to find their resting-place in vain: The ebbing sea thus beats against the shore; The shore repels it; it returns again. XII. [Lie, my fond heart at rest] Lie, my fond heart at rest, She never can be ours. Why strike upon my breast The slowly passing hours? Ah! breathe not out the name! That fatal folly stay! Conceal the eternal flame, And tortured ne'er betray. XIII. [The heart you cherish can not change] The heart you cherish can not change; The fancy, faint and fond, Has never more the wish to range Nor power to rise beyond. XIV. [Clifton! in vain thy varied scenes invite] Clifton! in vain thy varied scenes invite, The mossy bank, dim glade, and dizzy hight; The sheep that, starting from the tufted thyme, Untune the distant church's mellow chime, As o'er each limb a gentle horror creeps, And shakes above our heads the craggy steeps. Pleasant I've thought it to pursue the rower While light and darkness seize the changeful oar, The frolic Naiads drawing from below A net of silver round the black canoe. Now the last lonely solace must it be To watch pale evening brood o'er land and sea, Then join my friends and let those friends believe My cheeks are moisten'd by the dews of eve. XV. [Ask me not, a voice severe] Ask me not, a voice severe Tells me, for it gives me pain. Peace! the hour, too sure, is near When I can not ask again. XVI. [O thou whose happy pencil strays] O thou whose happy pencil strays Where I am call'd, nor dare to gaze, But lower my eye and check my tongue; O, if thou valuest peaceful days, Pursue the ringlet's sunny maze, And dwell not on those lips too long. What mists athwart my temples fly, Now, touch by touch, thy fingers tie With torturing care her graceful zone! For all that sparkles from her eye I could not look while thou art by, Nor could I cease were I alone. XVII. [All tender thoughts that e'er possest] All tender thoughts that e'er possest The human brain or human breast, Centre in mine for thee . . Excepting one . . and that must thou Contribute: come, confer it now: Grateful I fain would be. XVIII. [Past ruin'd Ilion Helen lives] Past ruin'd Ilion Helen lives, Alcestis rises from the shades; Verse calls them forth; 'tis verse that gives Immortal youth to mortal maids. Soon shall Oblivion's deepening veil Hide all the peopled hills you see, The gay, the proud, while lovers hail These many summers you and me. XIX. [Soon, O Ianthe! life is o'er] Soon, O Ianthe! life is o'er, And sooner beauty's heavenly smile: Grant only (and I ask no more), Let love remain that little while. XX. [Flow, precious tears! thus shall my rival know] Flow, precious tears! thus shall my rival know For me, not him, ye flow. Stay, precious tears! ah stay! this jealous heart Would bid you flow apart, Lest he should see you rising o'er the brim, And hope you rise for him. Your secret cells, while he is present, keep, Nor, tho' I'm absent, weep. XXI. [It often comes into my head] It often comes into my head That we may dream when we are dead, But I am far from sure we do. O that it were so! then my rest Would be indeed among the blest; I should for ever dream of you. XXII. [Your pleasures spring like daisies in the grass] Your pleasures spring like daisies in the grass, Cut down, and up again as blithe as ever; From you, Ianthe, little troubles pass Like little ripples down a sunny river. XXIII. [Ianthe! you are call'd to cross the sea!] Ianthe! you are call'd to cross the sea! A path forbidden me! Remember, while the Sun his blessing sheds Upon the mountain-heads, How often we have watcht him laying down His brow, and dropt our own Against each other's, and how faint and short And sliding the support! What will succeed it now? Mine is unblest, Ianthe! nor will rest But on the very thought that swells with pain. O bid me hope again! O give me back what Earth, what (without you) Not Heaven itself can do, One of the golden days that we have past; And let it be my last! Or else the gift would be, however sweet, Fragile and incomplete. XXIV. [Mine fall, and yet a tear of hers] Mine fall, and yet a tear of hers Would swell, not soothe their pain. Ah! if she look but at these tears, They do not fall in vain. XXV. [Circe, who bore the diadem] Circe, who bore the diadem O'er every head we see, Pursued by thousands, turn'd from them And fill'd her cup for me. She seiz'd what little was design'd To catch a transient view; For thee alone she left behind The tender and the true. XXVI. [If mutable is she I love] If mutable is she I love, If rising doubts demand their place, I would adjure them not to move Beyond her fascinating face. Let it be question'd, while there flashes A liquid light of fleeting blue, Whether it leaves the eyes or lashes, Plays on the surface or peeps through. With every word let there appear So modest yet so sweet a smile, That he who hopes must gently fear, Who fears may fondly hope the while. XXVII. [Could but the dream of night return by day] Could but the dream of night return by day, And thus again the true Ianthe say, “Altho' some other I should live to see As fond, no other can have charms for me. No, in this bosom none shall ever share, Firm is, and tranquil be, your empire there! If wing'd with amorous fear the unfetter'd slave Stole back the struggling heart she rashly gave, Weak, they may call it, weak, but not untrue; Its destination, though it fail'd, was you. So to some distant isle the unconscious dove Bears at her breast the billet dear to love, But drops, while viewless lies the happier scene, On some hard rock or desert beach between.” XXVIII. [I love to hear that men are bound] I love to hear that men are bound By your enchanting links of sound: I love to hear that none rebel Against your beauty's silent spell. I know not whether I may bear To see it all, as well as hear; And never shall I clearly know Unless you nod and tell me so. XXIX. [Soon as Ianthe's lip I prest] Soon as Ianthe's lip I prest, Thither my spirit wing'd its way: Ah, there the wanton would not rest! Ah, there the wanderer could not stay! XXX. [Beloved the last! beloved the most!] Beloved the last! beloved the most! With willing arms and brow benign Receive a bosom tempest-tost, And bid it ever beat to thine. The Nereid maids, in days of yore, Saw the lost pilot loose the helm, Saw the wreck blacken all the shore, And every wave some head o'erwhelm. Afar the youngest of the train Beheld (but fear'd and aided not) A minstrel from the billowy main Borne breathless near her coral grot. Then terror fled, and pity rose . . “Ah me!” she cried, “I come too late! Rather than not have sooth'd his woes, I would, but may not, share his fate.” She rais'd his hand. “What hand like this Could reach the heart athwart the lyre! What lips like these return my kiss, Or breathe, incessant, soft desire!” From eve to morn, from morn to eve, She gazed his features o'er and o'er, And those who love and who believe May hear her sigh along the shore. XXXI. [Art thou afraid the adorer's prayer] Art thou afraid the adorer's prayer Be overheard? that fear resign. He waves the incense with such care It leaves no stain upon the shrine. XXXII. [You see the worst of love, but not the best] You see the worst of love, but not the best, Nor will you know him till he comes your guest. Tho' yearly drops some feather from his sides, In the heart's temple his pure torch abides. XXXIII. [While the winds whistle round my cheerless room] While the winds whistle round my cheerless room, And the pale morning droops with winter's gloom; While indistinct lie rude and cultured lands, The ripening harvest and the hoary sands; Alone, and destitute of every page That fires the poet or informs the sage, Where shall my wishes, where my fancy, rove, Rest upon past or cherish promist love? Alas! the past I never can regain, Wishes may rise and tears may flow . . in vain. Fancy, that brings her in her early bloom, Throws barren sunshine o'er the unyielding tomb. What then would passion, what would reason, do? Sure, to retrace is worse than to pursue. Here will I sit till heaven shall cease to lour And happier Hesper bring the appointed hour, Gaze on the mingled waste of sky and sea, Think of my love, and bid her think of me. XXXIV. [One pansy, one, she bore beneath her breast] One pansy, one, she bore beneath her breast, A broad white ribbon held that pansy tight. She waved about nor lookt upon the rest, Costly and rare; on this she bent her sight. I watcht her raise it gently when it droopt; I knew she wisht to show it me; I knew She would I saw it rise, to lie unloopt Nearer its home, that tender heart! that true! XXXV. [You tell me I must come again] You tell me I must come again Now buds and blooms appear: Ah! never fell one word in vain Of yours on mortal ear. You say the birds are busy now In hedgerow, brake, and grove, And slant their eyes to find the bough That best conceals their love: How many warble from the spray! How many on the wing! “Yet, yet,” say you, “one voice away I miss the sound of spring.” How little could that voice express, Beloved, when we met! But other sounds hath tenderness, Which neither shall forget. XXXVI. [I often ask upon whose arm she leans] I often ask upon whose arm she leans, She whom I dearly love, And if she visit much the crowded scenes Where mimic passions move. There, mighty powers! assert your just controul, Alarm her thoughtless breast, Breathe soft suspicion o'er her yielding soul, But never break its rest. O let some faithful lover, absent long, To sudden bliss return; Then Landor's name shall tremble from her tongue, Her cheek thro' tears shall burn. XXXVII. [I sadden while I view again] I sadden while I view again Smiles that for me the Graces wreathed. Sure my last kiss those lips retain And breathe the very vow they breathed; At peace, in sorrow, far or near, Constant and fond she still would be, And absence should the more endear The sigh it only woke for me. Till the slow hours have past away, Sweet image, bid my bosom rest. Vain hope! yet shalt thou night and day, Sweet image, to this heart be prest. XXXVIII. [A time will come when absence, grief, and years] A time will come when absence, grief, and years, Shall change the form and voice that please you now, When you perplext shall ask, “And fell my tears Into his bosom? breath'd I there my vow?” It must be so, Ianthe! but to think Malignant Fate should also threaten you, Would make my heart, now vainly buoyant, sink: Believe it not: 'tis what I'll never do. XXXIX. [Have I, this moment, led thee from the beach] Have I, this moment, led thee from the beach Into the boat? now far beyond my reach! Stand there a little while, and wave once more That kerchief; but may none upon the shore Dare think the fond salute was meant for him! Dizzily on the plashing water swim My heavy eyes, and sometimes can attain Thy lovely form, which tears bear off again. In vain have they now ceast; it now is gone Too far for sight, and leaves me here alone. O could I hear the creaking of the mast! I curst it present, I regret it past. XL. [Yes, we shall meet (I knew we should) again] Yes, we shall meet (I knew we should) again, And I am solaced now you tell me when. Joy sprung o'er sorrow as the morning broke, And, as I read the words, I thought you spoke. Altho' you bade it, yet to find how fast My spirits rose, how lightly grief flew past, I blush at every tear I have represt, And one is starting to reprove the rest. XLI. [Ye walls! sole witnesses of happy sighs] Ye walls! sole witnesses of happy sighs, Say not, blest walls, one word. Remember, but keep safe from ears and eyes All you have seen and heard. XLII. IANTHE'S LETTER. We will not argue, if you say My sorrows when I went away Were not for you alone; For there were many very dear, Altho' at dawn they came not near, As you did, yet who griev'd when I was gone. We will not argue (but why tell So false a tale?) that scarcely fell My tears where mostly due. I can not think who told you so: I shed (about the rest I know Nothing at all) the first and last for you. XLIII. [“Remember you the guilty night,”] “Remember you the guilty night,” A downcast myrtle said, “You snatcht and held me pale with fright Till life almost had fled? At every swell more close I prest With jealous care that lovely breast; Of every tender word afraid, I cast a broader, deeper shade, And trembled so, I fell between Two angel-guards, by you unseen: There, pleasures, perils, all forgot, I clung and fainted: who would not? Yet certainly, this transport over, I should, for who would not? recover. Yes! I was destined to return And sip anew the crystal urn, Where with four other sister sprays I bloom'd away my pleasant days. But less and less and less again Each day, hour, moment, is the pain My little shrivel'd heart endures . . Now can you say the same for yours? I torn from her and she from you, What wiser thing can either do Than with our joys our fears renounce And leave the vacant world at once? When she you fondly love must go, Your pangs will rise, but mine will cease; I never shall awake to woe, Nor you to happiness or peace.” XLIV. [On the smooth brow and clustering hair] On the smooth brow and clustering hair Myrtle and rose! your wreath combine, The duller olive I would wear, Its constancy, its peace, be mine. XLV. [Along this coast I led the vacant Hours] Along this coast I led the vacant Hours To the lone sunshine on the uneven strand, And nipt the stubborn grass and juicier flowers With one unconscious inobservant hand, While crept the other by degrees more near Until it rose the cherisht form around, And prest it closer, only that the ear Might lean, and deeper drink some half-heard sound. XLVI. [Pursuits! alas, I now have none] Pursuits! alas, I now have none, But idling where were once pursuits, Often, all morning quite alone, I sit upon those twisted roots Which rise above the grass, and shield Our harebell, when the churlish year Catches her coming first afield, And she looks pale tho' spring is near; I chase the violets, that would hide Their little prudish heads away, And argue with the rills, that chide When we discover them at play. XLVII. [No, thou hast never griev'd but I griev'd too] No, thou hast never griev'd but I griev'd too; Smiled thou hast often when no smile of mine Could answer it. The sun himself can give But little colour to the desert sands. XLVIII. [Where alders rise up dark and dense] Where alders rise up dark and dense But just behind the wayside fence, A stone there is in yonder nook Which once I borrow'd of the brook: You sate beside me on that stone, Rather (not much) too wide for one. Untoward stone! and never quite (Tho' often very near it) right, And putting to sore shifts my wit To roll it out, then steady it, And then to prove that it must be Too hard for anyone but me. Ianthe, haste! ere June declines We'll write upon it all these lines. XLIX. [From heaven descend two gifts alone] From heaven descend two gifts alone; The graceful line's eternal zone And beauty, that too soon must die. Exposed and lonely Genius stands, Like Memnon in the Egyptian sands, At whom barbarian javelins fly. For mutual succour Heaven design'd The lovely form and vigorous mind To seek each other and unite. Genius! thy wing shall beat down Hate, And Beauty tell her fears at Fate Until her rescuer met her sight. L. [Remain, ah not in youth alone] Remain, ah not in youth alone, Tho' youth, where you are, long will stay, But when my summer days are gone, And my autumnal haste away. “Can I be always by your side?” No; but the hours you can, you must, Nor rise at Death's approaching stride, Nor go when dust is gone to dust. LI. [It is no dream that I am he] It is no dream that I am he Whom one awake all night Rose ere the earliest birds to see, And met by dawn's red light; Who, when the wintry lamps were spent And all was drear and dark, Against the rugged pear-tree leant While ice crackt off the bark; Who little heeded sleet and blast, But much the falling snow; Those in few hours would sure be past, His traces that might show; Between whose knees, unseen, unheard, The honest mastiff came, Nor fear'd he; no, nor was he fear'd: Tell me, am I the same? O come! the same dull stars we'll see, The same o'er-clouded moon. O come! and tell me am I he? O tell me, tell me soon. LII. [Here, ever since you went abroad] Here, ever since you went abroad, If there be change, no change I see, I only walk our wonted road, The road is only walkt by me. Yes; I forgot; a change there is; Was it of that you bade me tell? I catch at times, at times I miss The sight, the tone, I know so well. Only two months since you stood here! Two shortest months! then tell me why Voices are harsher than they were, And tears are longer ere they dry. LIII. [Silent, you say, I'm grown of late] Silent, you say, I'm grown of late, Nor yield, as you do, to our fate? Ah! that alone is truly pain Of which we never can complain. LIV. [I held her hand, the pledge of bliss] I held her hand, the pledge of bliss, Her hand that trembled and withdrew; She bent her head before my kiss . . My heart was sure that hers was true. Now I have told her I must part, She shakes my hand, she bids adieu, Nor shuns the kiss. Alas, my heart! Hers never was the heart for you. LV. TO LOVE. Where is my heart, perfidious boy? Give it, ah give it back again! I ask no more for hours of joy, Left but thy arm, and burst my chain. “Fond man the heart we rashly gave She prizes not but won't restore; She passes on from slave to slave— Go, go; thy heart is thine no more.” LVI. [You smiled, you spoke, and I believed] You smiled, you spoke, and I believed, By every word and smile deceived. Another man would hope no more; Nor hope I what I hoped before: But let not this last wish be vain; Deceive, deceive me once again! LVII. [Proud word you never spoke, but you will speak] Proud word you never spoke, but you will speak Four not exempt from pride some future day. Resting on one white hand a warm wet cheek Over my open volume you will say, “This man loved me!” then rise and trip away LVIII. [Tears, and tears only, are these eyes that late] Tears, and tears only, are these eyes that late In thine could contemplate Charms which, like stars, in swift succession rise. No longer to these eyes! Love shows the place he flew from; there, bereft Of motion, Grief is left. LIX. [The Loves who many years held all my mind] The Loves who many years held all my mind, A charge so troublesome at last resign'd. Among my books a feather here and there Tells what the inmates of my study were. Strong for no wrestle, ready for no race, They only serve to mark the left-off place. 'Twas theirs to dip in the tempestuous waves, 'Twas theirs to loiter in cool summer caves; But in the desert where no herb is green Not one, the latest of the flight, is seen. LX. [As round the parting ray the busy motes] As round the parting ray the busy motes In eddying circles play'd, Some little bird threw dull and broken notes Amid an elder's shade. My soul was tranquil as the scene around, Ianthe at my side; Both leaning silent on the turfy mound, Lowly and soft and wide. I had not lookt, that evening, for the part One hand could disengage, To make her arms cling round me, with a start My bosom must assuage: Silence and soft inaction please as much Sometimes the stiller breast, Which passion now has thrill'd with milder touch And love in peace possest. “Hark! hear you not the nightingale?” I said, To strike her with surprise. “The nightingale?” she cried, and raised her head, And beam'd with brighter eyes. “Before you said 'twas he that piped above, At every thrilling swell He pleas'd me more and more; he sang of love So plaintively, so well.” Where are ye, happy days, when every bird Pour'd love in every strain? Ye days, when true was every idle word, Return, return again! LXI. [So late removed from him she swore] So late removed from him she swore, With clasping arms and vows and tears, In life and death she would adore, While memory, fondness, bliss, endears. Can she forswear? can she forget? Strike, mighty Love! strike, Vengeance! Soft! Conscience must come and bring regret . . These let her feel! . . nor these too oft! LXII. [Mild is the parting year, and sweet] Mild is the parting year, and sweet The odour of the falling spray; Life passes on more rudely fleet, And balmless is its closing day. I wait its close, I court its gloom, But mourn that never must there fall Or on my breast or on my tomb The tear that would have sooth'd it all. LXIII. [Dull is my verse: not even thou] Dull is my verse: not even thou Who movest many cares away From this lone breast and weary brow, Canst make, as once, its fountain play; No, nor those gentle words that now Support my heart to hear thee say: “The bird upon its lonely bough Sings sweetest at the close of day.” LXIV. [When we have panted past life's middle space] When we have panted past life's middle space, And stand and breathe a moment from the race, These graver thoughts the heaving breast annoy: “Of all our fields how very few are green! And ah! what brakes, moors, quagmires, lie between Tired age and childhood ramping wild with joy.” LXV. [There are some wishes that may start] There are some wishes that may start Nor cloud the brow nor sting the heart. Gladly then would I see how smiled One who now fondles with her child; How smiled she but six years ago, Herself a child, or nearly so. Yes, let me bring before my sight The silken tresses chain'd up tight, The tiny fingers tipt with red By tossing up the strawberry-bed; Half-open lips, long violet eyes, A little rounder with surprise, And then (her chin against the knee) “Mamma! who can that stranger be? How grave the smile he smiles on me!” LXVI. [Youth is the virgin nurse of tender Hope] Youth is the virgin nurse of tender Hope, And lifts her up and shows a far-off scene: When Care with heavy tread would interlope, They call the boys to shout her from the green. Ere long another comes, before whose eyes Nurseling and nurse alike stand mute and quail. Wisdom: to her Hope not one word replies, And Youth lets drop the dear romantic tale. LXVII. [Here, where precipitate Spring, with one light bound] Here, where precipitate Spring, with one light bound Into hot Summer's lusty arms, expires, And where go forth at morn, at eve, at night, Soft airs that want the lute to play with 'em, And softer sighs that know not what they want, Aside a wall, beneath an orange-tree, Whose tallest flowers could tell the lowlier ones Of sights in Fiesolè right up above, While I was gazing a few paces off At what they seem'd to show me with their nods, Their frequent whispers and their pointing shoots, A gentle maid came down the garden steps And gathered the pure treasure in her lap. I heard the branches rustle, and stept forth To drive the ox away, or mule or goat, Such I believed it must be. How could I Let beast o'erpower them? When hath wind or rain Borne hard upon weak plant that wanted me, And I (however they might bluster round) Walkt off? 'Twere most ungrateful: for sweets scents Are the swift vehicles of still sweeter thoughts, And nurse and pillow the dull memory That would let drop without them her best stores. They bring me tales of youth and tones of love. And 'tis and ever was my wish and way To let all flowers live freely, and all die (Whene'er their Genius bids their souls depart) Among their kindred in their native place. I never pluck the rose; the violet's head Hath shaken with my breath upon its bank And not reproacht me; the ever-sacred cup Of the pure lily hath between my hands Felt safe, unsoil'd, nor lost one grain of gold. I saw the light that made the glossy leaves More glossy; the fair arm, the fairer cheek Warmed by the eye intent on its pursuit; I saw the foot that, altho' half-erect From its grey slipper, could not lift her up To what she wanted: I held down a branch And gather'd her some blossoms; since their hour Was come, and bees had wounded them, and flies Of harder wing were working their way thro' And scattering them in fragments under-foot. So crisp were some, they rattled unevolved, Others, ere broken off, fell into shells, For such appear the petals when detacht, Unbending, brittle, lucid, white like snow, And like snow not seen thro', by eye or sun: Yet every one her gown received from me Was fairer than the first. I thought not so, But so she praised them to reward my care. I said, “You find the largest.” “This indeed,” Cried she, “is large and sweet.” She held one forth, Whether for me to look at or to take She knew not, nor did I; but taking it Would best have solved (and this she felt) her doubt. I dared not touch it; for it seemed a part Of her own self; fresh, full, the most mature Of blossoms, yet a blossom; with a touch To fall, and yet unfallen. She drew back The boon she tender'd, and then, finding not The ribbon at her waist to fix it in. Dropt it, as loth to drop it, on the rest. LXVIII. [Hark! 'tis the laugh of Spring: she comes] Hark! 'tis the laugh of Spring: she comes, With airy sylphs and fiery gnomes; On cruel mischief these intent, And those as anxious to prevent. So now for frolic and for fun And swains forsworn and maids undone; So now for bridegrooms and for brides And rivals hang'd by river-sides. Here the hoarse-wooing dove is heard, And there the cuckoo, taunting bird! But soon along the osier vale Will warble the sweet nightingale, Amid whose song chaste Eve must hear The threats of love, the screams of fear, The milk-maid's shriek of laughter shrill From hovel close beneath the hill, Before the door the whirring wheel, Behind the hedge the ticklish squeal, The shepherd rude, the hoyden wroth, The boisterous rip of stubborn cloth, The brisk repulse, the pressing pray'r, “Ah do!” and “do it if you dare!” But whence, at every field we pass, Those hollows in the starting grass? The little Loves have gambol'd there, Or fought or wrestled pair by pair. Moist are the marks of struggling feet, And the bruis'd herbage still smells sweet. Let Nancy now, if Nancy will, Return the kiss she took so ill. If gentler thoughts thy bosom move, Come, Nancy, give the kiss of love. Soft is the bank I rest on here, And soft the river murmurs near: Above, the wandering dimples play, Run round, unwind, and melt away: Beneath, more regular, more slow, The grassy weeds wave to and fro, While the sharp reed, it peers so high, Shakes at each swell that passes by. The poor tired bird who fain would drink, But fears the abrupt and crumbling brink, Sees that his weight 'twill not sustain, And hovers, and flies back again. My Nancy, thus I thirst for you, And he flies off as I may do. LXIX. [I would invoke you once again] I would invoke you once again, Pale shades of gloomy Walcheren, By every name most dear! But every name what voice could call? What tears could flow enough for all, Within the circling year? Yet comfort ye, illustrious band, That might have saved your native land Had life and health remain'd! Who cast ye on those sands accurst? Traitor! he sold his country first And gave her up enchain'd. No human power the wretch shall screen That sent you to the misty scene, Where glory never shone! His vacant buoyant heart shall rue The lingering death he brought on you And wish that death his own. LXX. THE PROGRESS OF EVENING. From yonder wood mark blue-eyed Eve proceed: First thro' the deep and warm and secret glens, Thro' the pale-glimmering privet-scented lane, And thro' those alders by the river-side: Now the soft dust impedes her, which the sheep Have hollow'd out beneath their hawthorn shade. But ah! look yonder! see a misty tide Rise up the hill, lay low the frowning grove, Enwrap the gay white mansion, sap its sides Until they sink and melt away like chalk; Now it comes down against our village-tower, Covers its base, floats o'er its arches, tears The clinging ivy from the battlements, Mingles in broad embrace the obdurate stone, (All one vast ocean), and goes swelling on In slow and silent, dim and deepening waves. LXXI. [In Clementina's artless mien] In Clementina's artless mien Lucilla asks me what I see, And are the roses of sixteen Enough for me? Lucilla asks, if that be all, Have I not cull'd as sweet before: Ah yes, Lucilla! and their fall I still deplore. I now behold another scene, Where Pleasure beams with heaven's own light, More pure, more constant, more serene, And not less bright: Faith, on whose breast the Loves repose, Whose chain of flowers no force can sever, And Modesty who, when she goes, Is gone for ever. LXXII. [Against the rocking mast I stand] Against the rocking mast I stand, The Atlantic surges swell To bear me from my native land And Psyche's wild farewell. From billow upon billow hurl'd, Again I hear her say, “Oh! is there nothing in the world Worth one short hour's delay?” Alas, my Psyche! were it thus, I should not sail alone, Nor seas nor fates had sever'd us . . But are you all my own? Thus were it, never would burst forth These sighs so deep, so true! But, what to me is little worth, The world, is much to you. And you shall say, when once the dream (So hard to break!) is o'er, My love was very dear to him, My fame and peace were more. LXXIII. [To-morrow, brightest-eyed of Avon's train] To-morrow, brightest-eyed of Avon's train, To-morrow thou art, slave-like, bound and sold, Another's and another's! Haste away, Wind thro' the willows, dart along the path; It nought avails thee; nought our plaint avails. O happy those before me who could say “Short tho' thy period, sweet Tacæa, short Ere thou art destin'd to the depths below, Even from thy valley-cradle, saffron-strown, Thou passest half thy sunny hours with me.” I mourn not, envy not, what others gain; Thee and thy venerable elms I mourn, Thy old protectors! ruthless was the pride And gaunt the need that made their heads lie low! I see the meadow's tender grass start back, See from their prostrate trunks the gory glare. Ah! pleasant was it once to watch thy waves Swelling o'er pliant beds of glossy weed; Pleasant to watch them dip amid the stones, Chirp, and spring over, glance and gleam along, And tripping light their wanton way pursue. Methinks they now with mellow mournfulnes Bid their faint breezes chide my fond delay, Nor suffer on the bridge nor on the knee My poor irregularly pencill'd page. Alas, Tacæa, thou art sore deceived! Here are no foreign words, no fatal seal, But thou and all who hear me shall avow The simple notes of sorrow's song are here. LXXIV. WRITTEN IN WALES. Ipsley! when hurried by malignant fate I past thy court and heard thy closing gate, I sigh'd, but sighing to myself I said “Now for the quiet cot and mountain shade.” Ah! what resistless madness made me roam From cheerful friends and hospitable home! Whether in Arrow's vale or Tachbrook's grove My lyre resounded Liberty and Love. Here never Love hath fann'd his purple flame, And fear and anger start at Freedom's name. Yet high exploits the churlish nation boasts Against the Norman and the Roman hosts. 'Tis false; where conquest had but reapt disgrace Contemptuous Valour spurn'd the reptile race. Let me once more my native land regain, Bounding with steady pride and high disdain; Then will I pardon all the faults of fate, And hang fresh garlands, Ipsley, on thy gate. LXXV. [Maria! I have said adieu] Maria! I have said adieu To one alone so fair as you; And she, beyond my hopes, at last Returns and tells me of the past; While happier for remembering well Am I to hear and she to tell. Whether gay Paris may again Admire you gayest of her train, Or, Love for pilot, you shall go Where Orellana's waters flow, And cull, amid Brazilian bowers, Of richer fruits and gaudier flowers; Or on the Siene or on the Line Remember one command of mine: Love with as steady love as e'er Illumed the only breast so fair; That, in another year at most, Whether the Alps or seas are crost, Something may scatter from the flame Fresh lustre o'er Pereira's name. LXXVI. [Wert thou but blind, O Fortune, then perhaps] Wert thou but blind, O Fortune, then perhaps Thou mightest always have avoided me; For never voice of mine (young, middle-aged, Or going down on tottering knee the shelf That crumbles with us to the vale of years) Call'd thee aside, whether thou rannest on To others who expected, or didst throw Into the sleeper's lap the unsought prize. But blind thou art not; the refreshing cup For which my hot heart thirsted, thou hast ever (When it was full and at the lip) struck down. LXXVII. [Let me sit here and muse by thee] Let me sit here and muse by thee Awhile, aërial Fiesole! Thy shelter'd walks and cooler grots, Villas and vines and olive-plots, Catch me, entangle me, detain me, And laugh to hear that aught can pain me. 'Twere just, if ever rose one sigh To find the lighter mount more high, Or any other natural thing So trite that Fate would blush to sing, Of Honour's sport or Fortune's frown, Clung to my heart and kept it down. But shunn'd have I on every side The splash of newly-mounted Pride, And never riskt my taking cold In the damp chambers of the old. What has the zephyr brought so sweet? 'Tis the vine-blossom round my seat. Ah! how much better here at ease And quite alone to catch the breeze, Than roughly wear life's waning day On rotten forms with Castlereagh, 'Mid public men for private ends, A friend to foes, a foe to friends! Long since with youthful chases warm, And when ambition well might charm, And when the choice before me lay, I heard the din and turn'd away. Hence oftentimes imperial Seine Hath listen'd to my early strain, And past the Rhine and past the Rhone My Latian muse is heard and known: Nor is the life of one recluse An alien quite from public use. Where alders mourn'd their fruitless beds A thousand cedars raise their heads, And from Segovia's hills remote, My sheep enrich my neighbour's cote. The wide and easy road I lead Where never paced the harnest steed, Where hardly dared the goat look down Beneath her parent mountain's frown, Suspended while the torrent-spray Springs o'er the crags that roll away. Cares if I had, I turn'd those cares Toward my partridges and hares, At every dog and gun I heard Ill-auguring for some truant bird, Or whisker'd friend of jet-tipt ear, Until the frighten'd eld limpt near. These knew me, and 'twas quite enough, I paid no Morning Post to puff, Saw others fame and wealth increase, Ate my own mutton-chop in peace, Open'd my window, snatcht my glass, And, from the rills that chirp and pass, A pure libation pour'd to thee, Unsoil'd uncitied Liberty! Lanthony! an ungenial clime, And the broad wing of restless Time, Have rudely swept thy massy walls And rockt thy abbots in their palls. I loved thee by thy streams of yore, By distant streams I love thee more; For never is the heart so true As bidding what we love adieu. Yet neither where we first drew breath, Nor where our fathers sleep in death, Nor where the mystic ring was given, The link from earth that reaches heaven, Nor London, Paris, Florence, Rome, In his own heart's the wise man's home, Stored with each keener, kinder, sense, Too firm, too lofty, for offence, Unlittered by the tools of state, And greater than the great world's great. If mine no glorious work may be, Grant, Heaven! and 'tis enough for me, (While many squally sails flit past, And many break the ambitious mast) From all that they pursue, exempt, The stormless bay of deep contempt! LXXVIII. FOR AN URN IN THORESBY PARK. With frigid art our numbers flow For joy unfelt and fabled woe; And listless are the poet's dreams Of pastoral pipe and haunted streams. All Nature's boundless reign is theirs, But most her triumphs and her tears. They try, nor vainly try, their power To cheer misfortune's lonely hour; Whether they raise the laurell'd head, Or stoop beneath the peasant's shed, They pass the glory they bestow, And shine above the light they throw. To Valour, in his car of fire, Shall Genius strike the solemn lyre: A Riou's fall shall Manvers mourn, And Virtue raise the vacant urn. LXXIX. ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE DEATH OF A MOTHER AND THREE CHILDREN. Again, my soul, sustain the mournful page! Is there no difference? none of place? of age? How the words tremble, how the lines unite! What dim confusion floats before my sight! Thrice happy strangers, to whose roving eyes Unwet with tears these public columns rise! Whate'er the changeful world contains of new, These are events the least observed by you. O Lambe, my early guide, my guardian friend, Must thus our pleasures, thus our prospects end! When the fond mother claspt her fever'd child, Death hail'd the omen, waved his dart, and smiled, Nor unobserv'd his lengthen'd wings o'erspread With deeper darkness each devoted head. She knows his silent footsteps; they have past Two other babes; two more have breath'd their last. What now avails thee, what avail'd thee then, To shine in science o'er the sons of men! Each varying plant, each tortuous root, to know, How latent pests from lucid waters flow, All the deep bosom of the air contains, Fire's parent strength and earth's prolific veins. The last and hardest lesson teaches this, Frail is our knowledge, frailer is our bliss. LXXX. [Ah what avails the sceptred race] Ah what avails the sceptred race, Ah what the form divine! What every virtue, every grace! Rose Aylmer, all were thine. Rose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes May weep, but never see, A night of memories and of sighs I consecrate to thee. LXXXI. [Child of a day, thou knowest not] Child of a day, thou knowest not The tears that overflow thine urn, The gushing eyes that read thy lot, Nor, if thou knewest, couldst return! And why the wish! the pure and blest Watch like thy mother o'er thy sleep. O peaceful night! O envied rest! Thou wilt not ever see her weep. LXXXII. ON A POET IN A WELSH CHURCHYARD. Kind souls! who strive what pious hand shall bring The first-found crocus from reluctant Spring, Or blow your wintry fingers while they strew This sunless turf with rosemary and rue, Bend o'er your lovers first, but mind to save One sprig of each to trim a poet's grave. LXXXIII. [Thou in this wide cold church art laid] Thou in this wide cold church art laid, Close to the wall, my little maid! My little Fanny Verchild! thou Sole idol of an infant vow! My playmate in life's break of day, When all we had to do was play! Even then, if any other girl To kiss my forehead seiz'd a curl, Thou wouldst with sad dismay run in, And stamp, and call it shame and sin. And should some rash intrusive boy Bring thee an orange, flower, or toy, That instant I laid fist on frill, I bore my jealousy so ill, And felt my bosom beat so bold, Altho' he might be six years old. Against the marble slab mine eyes Dwell fixt; and from below arise Thoughts, not yet cold nor mute, of thee It was their earliest joy to see. One who had marcht o'er Minden's plain In thy young smile grew young again. That stern one melted into love, That father traced the line above. His Roman soul used Roman speech, And taught (ah thou too, thou didst teach!) How, soon as in our course we start, Death follows with uplifted dart. LXXXIV. [Tears driven back upon the fountain-head] Tears driven back upon the fountain-head, And Sorrow's voice supprest, Heave, while in quiet sleep repose the dead; Oh! when will they too rest! LXXXV. [Not the last struggles of the Sun] Not the last struggles of the Sun, Precipitated from his golden throne, Hold darkling mortals in sublime suspense; But the calm exod of a man Nearer, tho' far above, who ran The race we run, when Heaven recalls him hence. Thus, O thou pure of earthly taint! Thus, O my Southey! poet, sage, and saint! Thou, after saddest silence, art removed. What voice in anguish can we raise, Or would we? Need we, dare we, praise? God now does that, the God thy whole heart loved. LXXXVI. [The day returns, my natal day] The day returns, my natal day, Borne on the storm and pale with snow, And seems to ask me why I stay, Stricken by Time and bowed by Woe. Many were once the friends who came To wish me joy; and there are some Who wish it now; but not the same; They are whence friend can never come Nor are they you my love watcht o'er Cradled in innocence and sleep; You smile into my eyes no more, Nor see the bitter tears they weep. LXXXVII. [When Helen first saw wrinkles in her face] When Helen first saw wrinkles in her face ('Twas when some fifty long had settled there And intermarried and brancht off awide) She threw herself upon her couch and wept: On this side hung her head, and over that Listlessly she let fall the faithless brass That made the men as faithless. But when you Found them, or fancied them, and would not hear That they were only vestiges of smiles, Or the impression of some amorous hair Astray from cloistered curls and roseate band, Which had been lying there all night perhaps Upon a skin so soft, “No, no,” you said, “Sure, they are coming, yes, are come, are here: Well, and what matters it, while thou art too!” LXXXVIII. [A provident and wakeful fear] A provident and wakeful fear Impels me, while I read, to say, When Poesy invites, forbear Sometimes to walk her tempting way: Readier is she to swell the tear Than its sharp tinglings to allay. “But there are stories fit for song, And fit for maiden lips to sing.” Yes; and to you they all belong, About your knee they fondly cling: They love the accents of your tongue, They seek the shadow of your wing. Ah! let the Hours be light and gay, With Hope for ever at their side, And let the Muses chaunt a lay Of pleasures that await the bride, Of sunny Life's untroubled sea, Smooth sands, and gently swelling tide. A time will come when steps are slow, And prone on ancient scenes to rest, When life shall lose its former glow, And, leaf by leaf, the shrinking breast Shall drop the blossom yet to blow For the most blessed of the blest. Then, nor till then, in spring go forth “The graves of waiting friends to see.” It would be pleasant to my earth To know your step, if that might be. A verse is more than I am worth, A thought is not undue to me. LXXXIX. [Boastfully call we all the world our own] Boastfully call we all the world our own: What are we who should call it so? The form Erect, the eye that pierces stars and suns, Droop and decay; no beast so piteously. More mutable than wind-worn leaves are we: Yea, lower are we than the dust's estate; The very dust is as it was before; Dissever'd from ourselves, aliens and outcasts From what our pride dared call inheritance, We only live to feel our fall and die. XC. [When the mimosas shall have made] When the mimosas shall have made (O'erarching) an unbroken shade; And the rose-laurels let to breathe Scarcely a favourite flower beneath; When the young cypresses which now Look at the olives, brow to brow, Cheer'd by the breezes of the south Shall shoot above the acacia's growth, One peradventure of my four Turning some former fondness o'er, At last impatient of the blame Cast madly on a father's name, May say, and check the chided tear, “I wish he still were with us here.” XCI. [Everything tells me you are near] Everything tells me you are near; The hail-stones bound along and melt, In white array the clouds appear, The spring and you our fields have felt. Paris, I know, is hard to quit; But you have left it; and 'twere silly To throw away more smiles and wit Among the forests of Chantilly. Her moss-paved cell your rose adorns To tempt you; and your cyclamen Turns back his tiny twisted horns As if he heard your voice again. XCII. [November! thou art come again] November! thou art come again With all thy gloom of fogs and rain, Yet woe betide the wretch who sings Of sadness borne upon thy wings. The gloom that overcast my brow, The whole year's gloom, departs but now; And all of joy I hear or see, November! I ascribe to thee! XCIII. [Retire, and timely, from the world, if ever] Retire, and timely, from the world, if ever Thou hopest tranquil days; Its gaudy jewels from thy bosom sever, Despise its pomp and praise. The purest star that looks into the stream Its slightest ripple shakes, And Peace, where'er its fiercer splendours gleam, Her brooding nest forsakes. The quiet planets roll with even motion In the still skies alone; O'er ocean they dance joyously, but ocean They find no rest upon. XCIV. [To our past loves we oft return] To our past loves we oft return, When years that choked our path are past, And wish again the incense-urn Its flickering flame once more to cast On paler brows, until the bourn Is reacht, where we may rest at last. XCV. [Smiles soon abate; the boisterous throe] Smiles soon abate; the boisterous throe Of anger long burst forth: Inconstantly the south-wind blows, But steadily the north. Thy star, O Venus! often changes Its radiant seat above; The chilling pole-star never ranges. 'Tis thus with hate and love. XCVI. [I will not call her fair] I will not call her fair, For that all women are, Shady or sunny, dim of eye or bright: But tell me, tell me where Is one of tint so clear, Unless it may be one who bathes in upper light. The fair above their kind, Shallow of heart and mind, Share with the fragile flower and senseless stone Their richer tints; we find No vestige left behind: She moves the distant breast, and fills the whole alone. XCVII. [Did I then ask of you why one so wise] Did I then ask of you why one so wise Should often look on life with downcast eyes, And mar sometimes their brightness with a tear? The vainer and less gentle are more gay, Over the level wave they glide away, And little know what hidden rocks are near. XCVIII. [The maid I love ne'er thought of me] The maid I love ne'er thought of me Amid the scenes of gaiety; But when her heart or mine sank low, Ah then it was no longer so. From the slant palm she rais'd her head, And kist the cheek whence youth had fled. Angels! some future day for this, Give her as sweet and pure a kiss. XCIX. [Neither the suns nor frosts of rolling years] Neither the suns nor frosts of rolling years Dry up the springs or change the course of tears. Sorrow will ever mark her stated days, Sacred as those Religion claims for praise. C. [Why, why repine, my pensive friend] Why, why repine, my pensive friend, At pleasures slipt away? Some the stern Fates will never lend, And all refuse to stay. I see the rainbow in the sky, The dew upon the grass, I see them, and I ask not why They glimmer or they pass. With folded arms I linger not To call them back; 'twere vain; In this, or in some other spot, I know they'll shine again. CI. [Thou whom the wandering comets guide] Thou whom the wandering comets guide, O turn awhile to Virtue's side, Goddess by all adored! and deign Once more to smile on rising Spain. No secret pang my bosom wrings For prostrate lords and captive kings; I, mighty Power, invoke thy aid To Valour crost and Faith betray'd. O leave the marshal'd ranks of war, Nor blindly urge Bellona's car, When hearts so generous, arms so brave, Resist the conqueror, spurn the slave, And, striking home for equal laws, Pray Fortune to sustain the cause. Not such is theirs as wafted o'er The crescent and the crafty Moor; No tears for virgin honour flow, No father calls the avenging foe; Napoleon leads no faithless host, Nor tears the heart that trusts him most; A rescued son, a prince restored, Against his country draws the sword, And wily priests in vengeful mood Surround their fires with dykes of blood: Turn then, O Fortune, and sustain The cause of Freedom and of Spain! CII. [Humblest among the vernal train] Humblest among the vernal train, In giddy Flora's gustful reign, Uplift, uplift thy timid eyes! The violet shuns the trying hour, Soon sheds the rose its fondled flower, The gaudy tulip flaunts and dies. When Autumn mourns his gloomy end, When rains and howling blasts descend, When hill and vale and wood are bare, Before my path thy light I see, And tho' no other smiles to me, Thou smilest, here and everywhere. What name more graceful couldst thou chuse Than Caledonia's pastoral Muse, Breath'd in the mellow reed of Burns? Art thou not proud that name to share With her from whom, so passing fair, No heart unconquer'd e'er returns? CIII. [The burden of an ancient rhyme] The burden of an ancient rhyme Is, “By the forelock seize on Time.” Time in some corner heard it said; Pricking his ears, away he fled; And, seeing me upon the road, A hearty curse on me bestow'd. “What if I do the same by thee? How wouldst thou like it?” thunder'd he, And, without answer thereupon, Seizing my forelock . . it was gone. CIV. [Will mortals never know each other's station] Will mortals never know each other's station Without the herald? O abomination! Milton, even Milton, rankt with living men! Over the highest Alps of mind he marches, And far below him spring the baseless arches Of Iris, colouring dimly lake and fen. CV. [Tell me, perverse young year!] Tell me, perverse young year! Why is the morn so drear? Is there no flower to twine? Away, thou churl, away! 'Tis Rose's natal day, Reserve thy frown for mine. CVI. ON RECEIVING A BOOK TO WRITE IN. Tost in what corner hast thou lain? And why art thou come back again? I should as soon have thought to see One risen from the dead as thee. I have survived my glory now Three years; but just the same art thou; I am not quite; and three years hence I may have lept that ugly fence, Which men attempt to shirk in vain, And never can leap back again. But welcome, welcome! thou art sent I know on generous thoughts intent; And therefore thy pale cheeks I'll kiss Before I scribble more than this. CVII. A SEA-SHELL SPEAKS. Of late among the rocks I lay, But just behind the fretful spray, When suddenly a step drew near, And a man's voice, distinct and clear, Convey'd this solace . . “Come with me, Thou little outcast of the sea! Our destiny, poor shell, is one; We both may shine, but shine alone: Both are deprived of all we had In earlier days to make us glad, Or ask us why we should be sad: Which (you may doubt it as you will) To manly hearts is dearer still.” I felt, ere half these words were o'er, A few salt drops on me once more. CVIII. [Often I have heard it said] Often I have heard it said That her lips are ruby-red. Little heed I what they say, I have seen as red as they. Ere she smiled on other men, Real rubies were they then. When she kist me once in play, Rubies were less bright than they, And less bright were those which shone In the palace of the Sun. Will they be as bright again? Not if kist by other men. CIX. [In spring and summer winds may blow] In spring and summer winds may blow, And rains fall after, hard and fast; The tender leaves, if beaten low, Shine but the more for shower and blast. But when their fated hour arrives, When reapers long have left the field, When maidens rifle turn'd-up hives, And their last juice fresh apples yield, A leaf perhaps may still remain Upon some solitary tree, Spite of the wind and of the rain . . A thing you heed not if you see . . At last it falls. Who cares? not one: And yet no power on earth can ever Replace the fallen leaf upon Its spray, so easy to dissever. If such be love I dare not say, Friendship is such, too well I know; I have enjoy'd my summer day; 'Tis past; my leaf now lies below. CX. ON RECEIVING A PORTRAIT. To gaze on you when life's last gleams decline, And hold your hand, to the last clasp, in mine . . Of these two wishes, these my only two, One has been granted, gentle maid, by you: Were thus the other certain, I should go, And leave but one man happier here below. CXI. [Beauty's pure native gems, ye quivering hairs!] Beauty's pure native gems, ye quivering hairs! Once mingled with my own, While soft desires, ah me! were all the cares Two idle hearts had known. How is it, when I take ye from the shrine Which holds one treasure yet, That ye, now all of Nancy that is mine, Shrink from my fond regret? Ye leaves that droop not with the plant that bore ye, Start ye before my breath? Shrink ye from tender Love who would adore ye, O ye who fear not Death! CXII. SENT TO A LADY WITH FLOWERS. Take the last flowers your natal day May ever from my hand receive! Sweet as the former ones are they, And sweet alike be those they leave. Another, in the year to come, May offer them to smiling eyes; That smile would wake me from the tomb, That smile would win me from the skies. CXIII. [Very true, the linnets sing] Very true, the linnets sing Sweetest in the leaves of spring: You have found in all these leaves That which changes and deceives, And, to pine by sun or star, Left them, false ones as they are. But there be who walk beside Autumn's, till they all have died, And who lend a patient ear To low notes from branches sere. CXIV. ON HAIR FALLING OFF AFTER AN ILLNESS. Conon was he whose piercing eyes Saw Berenice's hair surmount the skies, Saw Venus spring away from Mars And twirl it round and fix it 'mid the stars. Then every poet who had seen The glorious sight sang to the youthful queen, Until the many tears were dried, Shed for that hair by that most lovely bride. Hair far more beauteous be it mine Not to behold amid the lights divine, But gracing, as it graced before, A brow serene which happier men adore. CXV. [First bring me Raffael, who alone hath seen] First bring me Raffael, who alone hath seen In all her purity Heaven's virgin queen, Alone hath felt true beauty; bring me then Titian, ennobler of the noblest men; And next the sweet Correggio, nor chastise His little Cupids for those wicked eyes. I want not Rubens's pink puffy bloom, Nor Rembrandt's glimmer in a dusty room. With those, and Poussin's nymph-frequented woods, His templed highths and long-drawn solitudes I am content, yet fain would look abroad On one warm sunset of Ausonian Claude. CXVI. FAREWELL TO ITALY. I leave thee, beauteous Italy! no more From the high terraces, at even-tide, To look supine into thy depths of sky, Thy golden moon between the cliff and me, Or thy dark spires of fretted cypresses Bordering the channel of the milky-way. Fiesole and Valdarno must be dreams Hereafter, and my own lost Affrico Murmur to me but in the poet's song. I did believe (what have I not believed?) Weary with age, but unopprest by pain, To close in thy soft clime my quiet day And rest my bones in the Mimosa's shade. Hope! Hope! few ever cherisht thee so little; Few are the heads thou hast so rarely raised; But thou didst promise this, and all was well. For we are fond of thinking where to lie When every pulse hath ceast, when the lone heart Can lift no aspiration . . reasoning As if the sight were unimpaired by death, Were unobstructed by the coffin-lid, And the sun cheered corruption! Over all The smiles of Nature shed a potent charm, And light us to our chamber at the grave. CXVII. [He who sees rising from some open down] He who sees rising from some open down A column, stately, beautiful, and pure, Its rich expansive capital would crown With glorious statue, which might long endure, And bring men under it to gaze and sigh And wish that honour'd creature they had known, Whose name the deep inscription lets not die. I raise that statue and inscribe that stone. CXVIII. TO ONE WHO SAID SHE SHOULD LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. When sea-born Venus guided o'er Her warrior to the Punic shore, Around that radiant head she threw In deep'ning clouds ambrosial dew: But when the Tyrian queen drew near, The light pour'd round him fresh and clear. Ill-starr'd Elissa! hence arose Her faithless joys, her stedfast woes, Sighs, that with life alone expire, And flames that light the funeral pyre. O Goddess! if that peerless maid Thou hast with every grace array'd, Must, listening to thy gentle voice, Fix at first view th' eternal choice . . Suspend the cloud before her eyes Until some godlike man arise; One of such wisdom that he knows How much he wins, how much he owes; One in whose breast united lie Calm courage and firm constancy; Whose genius makes the world his own, Whose glory rests in her alone. CXIX. ON AN ECLIPSE OF THE MOON. Struggling, and faint, and fainter didst thou wane, O Moon! and round thee all thy starry train Came forth to help thee, with half-open eyes, And trembled every one with still surprise, That the black Spectre should have dared assail Their beauteous queen and seize her sacred veil. CXX. ON SHAKESPEARE. In poetry there is but one supreme, Tho' there are many angels round his throne, Mighty, and beauteous, while his face is hid. CXXI. [There is, alas! a chill, a gloom] There is, alas! a chill, a gloom, About my solitary room That will not let one flowret bloom Even for you: The withering leaves appear to say, “Shine on, shine on, O lovely May! But we meanwhile must drop away.” Light! life! adieu. CXXII. [Ternissa! you are fled!] Ternissa! you are fled! I say not to the dead, But to the happy ones who rest below: For, surely, surely, where Your voice and graces are, Nothing of death can any feel or know. Girls who delight to dwell Where grows most asphodel, Gather to their calm breasts each word you speak: The mild Persephone Places you on her knee, And your cool palm smooths down stern Pluto's cheek. CXXIII. [You love me; but if I confess] You love me; but if I confess That I in turn love you no less, I know that you will glance aside With real or affected pride; And, be it true or be it feign'd, My bosom would alike be pain'd, So that I will not tell you now Whether I love; and as for vow . . You may demand it ten times over, And never win from wary lover. Mind! if we men would be as blest For ever as when first carest, We must excite a little fear, And sometimes almost domineer. CXXIV. [One morning in the spring I sate] One morning in the spring I sate Kicking my heels upon a gate, The birds were singing all around, And cowslips sunn'd the sheeny ground, And next to me above the post A certain shrub its branches tost, Seeming to whisper in my ear, “Have you no song for her so dear?” Now never in my life could I Write at command; I know not why. I tried to write; I tried in vain; The little birds, to mock my pain, Sang cheerily; and every note Seem'd rushing from a clearer throat. I was half mad to think that they So easily should win the day. The slender shrub I thought held down Its head to whisper “What a clown!” Stung by its touch and its reproof, And saying, “Keep your thorns aloof,” Unconsciously I spoke the name, And verses in full chorus came. CXXV. TO LADY CALDWELL. Sophy! before the fond adieu We long but shrink to say, And while the home prepared for you Looks dark at your delay, Before the graces you disclose By fresh ones are o'ershaded, And duties rise more grave than those, To last when those are faded, It will not weary you, I know, To hear again the voice First heard where Arno's waters flow And Flora's realms rejoice. Of beauty not a word have I (As thousands have) to say, Of vermeil lip or azure eye Or cheek of blushful May. The gentle temper blessing all, The smile at Envy's leer, Are yours; and yours at Pity's call The heart-assuaging tear. Many can fondle and caress . . No other have I known Proud of a sister's loveliness, Unconscious of her own. CXXVI. [To write as your sweet mother does] To write as your sweet mother does Is all you wish to do. Play, sing, and smile for others, Rose! Let others write for you. Or mount again your Dartmoor grey, And I will walk beside, Until we reach that quiet bay Which only hears the tide. Then wave at me your pencil, then At distance bid me stand, Before the cavern'd cliff, again The creature of your hand. And bid me then go past the nook, To sketch me less in size; There are but few content to look So little in your eyes. Delight us with the gifts you have, And wish for none beyond: To some be gay, to some be grave, To one (blest youth!) be fond. Pleasures there are how close to Pain, And better unpossest! Let poetry's too throbbing vein Lie quiet in your breast. CXXVII. [From leaves unopen'd yet, those eyes she lifts] From leaves unopen'd yet, those eyes she lifts, Which never youthful eyes could safely view. “A book or flower, such are the only gifts I like to take, nor like them least from you.” A voice so sweet it needs no music's aid Spake it, and ceast: we, offering both, reply: These tell the dull old tale that bloom must fade, This the bright truth that genius can not die. CXXVIII. CHRISTMAS HOLLY. Bethink we what can mean The holly's changeless green, Unyielding leaves, and seeds blood-red: These, while the smoke below Curls slowly upward, show Faith how her gentle Master bled. Those drop not at the touch Of busy over-much, They shrink not at the blazing grate; And the same green remains, As when autumnal rains Nurst them with milky warmth of late. The stedfast bough scarce bends, But hang it over friends And suddenly what thoughts there spring! Harsh voices all grow dumb, While myriad pleasures come Beneath Love's ever-widening wing. CXXIX. [Various the roads of life; in one] Various the roads of life; in one All terminate, one lonely way. We go; and “Is he gone?” Is all our best friends say. CXXX. [Never may storm thy peaceful bosom vex] Never may storm thy peaceful bosom vex, Thou lovely Exe! O'er whose pure stream that music yesternight Pour'd fresh delight, And left a vision for the eye of Morn To laugh to scorn, Showing too well how Love once led the Hours In Youth's green bowers; Vision too blest for even Hope to see, Were Hope with me; Vision my fate at once forbids to stay Or pass away. CXXXI. FOR THE ALBUM OF THE DUCHESS DE GUICHE. Children! while childhood lasts, one day Alone be less your gush of play. As you ascend that cloven steep Whence Lerici o'erlooks the deep, And watch the hawk and plover soar, And bow-winged curlew quit the shore, Think not, as graver heads might do, The same with equal ease could you; So light your spirits and your forms, So fearless is your race of storms. Mild be the sunbeams, mild the gales, Along Liguria's pendent vales. Whether from changeful Magra sped Or Tanaro's unquiet bed. Let Apennine and Alpine snows Be husht into unwaked repose, While Italy gives back again More charms and virtues than remain, Which France with loftier pride shall own Than all her brightest arms have won. CXXXII. [No, my own love of other years!] No, my own love of other years! No, it must never be. Much rests with you that yet endears, Alas! but what with me? Could those bright years o'er me revolve So gay, o'er you so fair, The pearl of life we would dissolve And each the cup might share. You show that truth can ne'er decay, Whatever fate befals; I, that the myrtle and the bay Shoot fresh on ruin'd walls. CXXXIII. LINES TO A DRAGON-FLY. Life (priest and poet say) is but a dream; I wish no happier one than to be laid Beneath a cool syringa's scented shade, Or wavy willow, by the running stream, Brimful of moral, where the dragon-fly, Wanders as careless and content as I. Thanks for this fancy, insect king, Of purple crest and filmy wing, Who with indifference givest up The water-lily's golden cup, To come again and overlook What I am writing in my book. Believe me, most who read the line Will read with hornier eyes than thine; And yet their souls shall live for ever, And thine drop dead into the river! God pardon them, O insect king, Who fancy so unjust a thing! CXXXIV. [Absent is she thou lovest? be it so] Absent is she thou lovest? be it so; Yet there is what should drive away thy woe And make the night less gloomy than the day. Absent she may be; yet her love appears Close by; and through the labyrinth of the ears Her voice's clue to the prone heart makes way. CXXXV. [“Do you remember me? or are you proud?”] “Do you remember me? or are you proud?” Lightly advancing thro' her star-trimm'd crowd, Ianthe said, and lookt into my eyes. “A yes, a yes, to both: for Memory Where you but once have been must ever be, And at your voice Pride from his throne must rise.” CXXXVI. [No charm can stay, no medicine can assuage] No charm can stay, no medicine can assuage, The sad incurable disease of age; Only the hand in youth more warmly prest Makes soft the couch and calms the final rest. CXXXVII. [Many may yet recall the hours] Many may yet recall the hours That saw thy lover's chosen flowers Nodding and dancing in the shade Thy dark and wavy tresses made: On many a brain is pictured yet Thy languid eye's dim violet: But who among them all foresaw How the sad snows which never thaw Upon that head one day should lie, And love but glimmer from that eye! CXXXVIII. TO A SPANIEL. No, Daisy! lift not up thy ear, It is not she whose steps draw near. Tuck under thee that leg, for she Continues yet beyond the sea, And thou may'st whimper in thy sleep These many days, and start and weep. CXXXIX. [True, ah too true! the generous breast] True, ah too true! the generous breast Lies bare to Love and Pain. May one alone, the worthier guest, Be yours, and there remain. CXL. ON SEEING A HAIR OF LUCRETIA BORGIA. Borgia, thou once wert almost too august And high for adoration; now thou'rt dust. All that remains of thee these plaits unfold, Calm hair, meandering in pellucid gold. CXLI. ON MIGNIONETTE. Stranger, these little flowers are sweet If you will leave them at your feet, Enjoying like yourself the breeze, And kist by butterflies and bees; But if you snap the fragile stem The vilest thyme outvalues them. Nor place nor flower would I select To make you serious and reflect. This heaviness was always shed Upon the drooping rose's head. Yet now perhaps your mind surveys Some village maid, in earlier days, Of charms thus lost, of life thus set, Ah bruise not then my Mignionette! CXLII. [In his own image the Creator made] In his own image the Creator made, His own pure sunbeam quicken'd thee, O man! Thou breathing dial! since thy day began The present hour was ever markt with shade! CXLIII. WRITTEN ON THE RHINE. Swiftly we sail along thy stream, War-stricken Rhine! and evening's gleam Shows us, throughout its course, The gaping scars (on either side, On every cliff) of guilty pride And unavailing force. Numberless castles here have frown'd, And cities numberless, spire-crown'd, Have fixt their rocky throne; Dungeons too deep and towers too high Ever for Love to hear the sigh Or Law avenge the groan. And, falser and more violent Than fraudful War, Religion lent Her scourge to quell the heart; Striking her palsy into Youth, And telling Innocence that Truth Is God's, and they must part. Hence victim crowns and iron vows, Binding ten thousand to one spouse, To keep them all from sin! Hence, for light dance and merry tale, The cloister's deep and stifling veil, That shuts the world within. Away! away! thou foulest pest That ever broke man's inner rest, Pouring the poison'd lie How to thy dragon grasp is given The power of Earth, the price of Heaven! Go! let us live and die Without thy curse upon our head, Monster! with human sorrows fed, Lo! here thy image stands. In Heidelberg's lone chambers, Rhine Shows what his ancient Palatine Received from thy meek hands! France! claim thy right, thy glory claim, Surpassing Rome's immortal fame! For, more than she could do In the long ages of her toils, With all her strength and all her spoils, Thy heroes overthrew. Crow, crow thy cock! thy eagle soar, Fiercer and higher than before! Thy boasts though few believe, Here faithful history shall relate What Gallic hearts could meditate And Gallic hands achieve. Fresh blows the gale, the scenes delight, Anear, afar, on plain, on hight; But all are far and vast: Day follows day, and shows not one The weary heart could rest upon To call its own at last. No curling dell, no cranky nook, No sylvan mead, no prattling brook, No little lake that stands Afraid to lift its fringed eye Of purest blue to its own sky, Or kiss its own soft sands. O! would I were again at home (If any such be mine) to roam Amid Lanthony's bowers, Or, where beneath the alders flow My Arrow's waters still and slow, Doze down the summer hours. CXLIV. MALVOLIO. Thou hast been very tender to the moon, Malvolio! and on many a daffodil And many a daisy hast thou yearn'd, until The nether jaw quiver'd with thy good heart. But tell me now, Malvolio, tell me true, Hast thou not sometimes driven from their play The village children, when they came too near Thy study, if hit ball rais'd shouts around, Or if delusive trap shook off thy muse, Pregnant with wonders for another age? Hast thou sat still and patient (tho' sore prest Hearthward to stoop and warm thy blue-nail'd hand) Lest thou shouldst frighten from a frosty fare The speckled thrush, raising his bill aloft To swallow the red berry on the ash By thy white window, three short paces off? If this thou hast not done, and hast done that, I do exile thee from the moon twelve whole Calendar months, debarring thee from use Of rose, bud, blossom, odour, simile, And furthermore I do hereby pronounce Divorce between the nightingale and thee. CXLV. WITH AN ALBUM. I know not whether I am proud, But this I know, I hate the crowd: Therefore pray let me disengage My verses from the motley page, Where others far more sure to please Pour out their choral song with ease. And yet perhaps, if some should tire With too much froth or too much fire, There is an ear that may incline Even to words so dull as mine. CXLVI. [My serious son! I see thee look] My serious son! I see thee look First on the picture, then the book. I catch the wish that thou couldst paint The yearnings of the ecstatic saint. Give it not up, my serious son! Wish it again, and it is done. Seldom will any fail who tries With patient hand and stedfast eyes, And wooes the true with such pure sighs. CXLVII. WRITTEN AT MR RAWSON'S, WAS-WATER LAKE. Loveliest of hills! from crime and care removed, Long these old firs and quiet roofs protect! Deepest of waters, long these scenes reflect! And, at your side, their lord, the well-beloved. For modest Wisdom, shunning loud acclaim, Hears Nature's voice call thro' it, and retreats To her repose upon your mossy seats, And in his heart finds all he wants of Fame. CXLVIII. [Give me the eyes that look on mine] Give me the eyes that look on mine, And, when they see them dimly shine, Are moister than they were. Give me the eyes that fain would find Some relicks of a youthful mind Amid the wrecks of care. Give me the eyes that catch at last A few faint glimpses of the past, And, like the arkite dove, Bring back a long-lost olive bough, And can discover even now A heart that once could love. CXLIX. [Loved, when my love from all but thee had flown] Loved, when my love from all but thee had flown, Come near me; seat thee on this level stone; And, ere thou lookest o'er the churchyard wall, To catch, as once we did, yon waterfall, Look a brief moment on the turf between, And see a tomb thou never yet hast seen. My spirit will be sooth'd to hear once more Good-bye as gently spoken as before. CL. [I leave with unreverted eye the towers] I leave with unreverted eye the towers Of Pisa pining o'er her desert stream. Pleasure (they say) yet lingers in thy bowers, Florence, thou patriot's sigh, thou poet's dream! O could I find thee as thou once wert known, Thoughtful and lofty, liberal and free! But the pure Spirit from thy wreck has flown, And only Pleasure's phantom dwells with thee. CLI. [Summer has doft his latest green] Summer has doft his latest green, And Autumn ranged the barley-mows. So long away then have you been? And are you coming back to close The year? it sadly wants repose. CLII. [Where Malvern's verdant ridges gleam] Where Malvern's verdant ridges gleam Beneath the morning ray, Look eastward: see Sabrina's stream Roll rapidly away: Not even such fair scenes detain Those who are cited to the main. It may not be: yet youth returns, Who runs (we hear) as fast, And in my breast the fire that burns She promises shall last. The lord of these domains was one Who loved me like an only son. I see the garden-walks so trim, The house-reflecting pond, I hear again the voice of him Who seldom went beyond The Roman camp's steep-sloping side, Or the long meadow's level ride. And why? A little girl there was Who fixt his eyes on home, Whether she roll'd along the grass, Or gates and hedges clomb, Or dared defy Alonzo's tale (Hold but her hand) to turn her pale. “Where is she now?” “Not far away.” “As brave too?” “Yes, and braver;” She dares to hear her hair turns gray, And never looks the graver: Nor will she mind Old Tell-tale more Than those who sang her charms before. How many idle things were said On eyes that were but bright! Their truer glory was delay'd To guide his steps aright Whose purest hand and loftiest mind Might lead the leaders of mankind. CLIII. ON THE DECEASE OF MRS ROSENHAGEN. Ah yes! the hour is come When thou must hasten home, Pure soul! to Him who calls. The God who gave thee breath Walks by the side of Death, And nought that step appals. Health has forsaken thee; Hope says thou soon shalt be Where happier spirits dwell, There where one loving word Alone is never heard, That loving word, farewell. CLIV. [How many voices gaily sing] How many voices gaily sing, “O happy morn, O happy spring Of life!” Meanwhile there comes o'er me A softer voice from Memory, And says, “If loves and hopes have flown With years, think too what griefs are gone!” CLV. [Who smites the wounded on his bed] Who smites the wounded on his bed, And only waits to strip the dead? In that dark room I see thee lurk, O low and lurid soul of Burke! Begone! Shall ever Southey's head lie low And unavenged beneath the savage blow? No, by my soul! tho' greater men And nearer stick the envenom'd pen Into that breast which always rose At all Man's wishes, all Man's woes. Look from thy couch of sorrow, look around! A sword of thy own temper guards the ground. If thou hast ever done amiss, It was, O Southey! but in this; That, to redeem the lost estate Of the poor Muse, a man so great Abased his laurels where some Georges stood Knee-deep in sludge and ordure, some in blood. Was ever Genius but thyself Friend or befriended of a Guelph? Who then should hail their natal days? What fiction weave the cobweb praise? At last comes she whose natal day be blest, And one more happy still, and all the rest! But since thou liest sick at heart And worn with years, some little part Of thy hard office let me try, Tho' inexpert was always I To toss the litter of Westphalian swine From under human to above divine. No soil'd or selfish hand shall bless That gentle bridal loveliness Which promises our land increase Of happy days in hard-earn'd peace. Grant the unpaid-for prayer, ye heavenly Powers! For her own sake, and greatly more for ours. Remember him who saved from scathe The honest front of ancient Faith; Then when the Pontine exhalations Breath'd pestilence thro' distant nations: Remember that mail'd hand, that heart so true, And with like power and will his race endue. CLVI. [What, of house and home bereft] What, of house and home bereft, For my birthday, what is left? Not the hope that any more Can be blest like those of yore, Not the wish; for wishes now Fall like flowers from aching brow, When the jovial feast is past, And when heaven, with clouds o'ercast, Strikes the colours from the scene, And no herb on earth is green. What is left me after all? What, beside my funeral? Bid it wait a little while, Just to let one thoughtful smile Its accustom'd time abide: There are left two boons beside . . Health, and eyes that yet can see Eyes not coldly turn'd from me. CLVII. [Under the hollies of thy breezy glade] Under the hollies of thy breezy glade, Needwood, in youth with idle pace I rode, Where pebbly rills their varied chirrup made, Rills which the fawn with tottering knees bestrode. Twilight was waning, yet I checkt my pace, Slow as it was, and longer would remain; Here first, here only, had I seen the face Of Nature free from change and pure from stain. Here in the glory of her power she lay, Here she rejoiced in all the bloom of health; Soon must I meet her faint and led astray, Freckled with feverish whims and wasted wealth. CLVIII. [Where three huge dogs are ramping yonder] Where three huge dogs are ramping yonder Before that villa with its tower, No braver boys, no father fonder, Ever prolong'd the moonlight hour. Often, to watch their sports unseen, Along the broad stone bench he lies, The oleander-stems between And citron-boughs to shade his eyes. The clouds now whiten far away, And villas glimmer thick below, And windows catch the quivering ray, Obscure one minute's space ago. Orchards and vine-knolls maple-propt Rise radiant round: the meads are dim, As if the milky-way had dropt And fill'd Valdarno to the brim. Unseen beneath us, on the right, The abbey with unfinisht front Of checker'd marble, black and white, And on the left the Doccia's font. Eastward, two ruin'd castles rise Beyond Maiano's mossy mill, Winter and Time their enemies, Without their warder, stately still. The heaps around them there will grow Higher, as years sweep by, and higher, Till every battlement laid low Is seized and trampled by the briar. That line so lucid is the weir Of Rovezzano: but behold The graceful tower of Giotto there, And Duomo's cross of freshen'd gold. We can not tell, so far away, Whether the city's tongue be mute, We only hear some lover play (If sighs be play) the sighing flute. CLIX. THE DEAD MARTEN. My pretty Marte, my winter friend, In these bright days ought thine to end! When all thy kindred far away Enjoy the genial hours of May. How often hast thou play'd with me, And lickt my lip to share my tea, And run away and turn'd again To hide my glove or crack my pen, Until I swore, to check thy taunts, I'd write to uncles and to aunts, And grandmama, whom dogs pursued But could not catch her in the wood. Ah! I repeat the jokes we had, Yet think me not less fond, less sad. Julia and Charles and Walter grave Would throw down every toy they have To see thy joyous eyes at eve, And feel thy feet upon the sleeve, And tempt thy glossy teeth to bite And almost hurt them, but not quite; For thou didst look, and then suspend The ivory barbs, but reprehend With tender querulous tones, that told Thou wert too good and we too bold. Never was malice in thy heart, My gentlest, dearest little Marte! Nor grief, nor reason to repine, As there is now in this of mine. CLX. [Ye little household gods, that make] Ye little household gods, that make My heart leap lighter with your play, And never let it sink or ache, Unless you are too far away; Eight years have flown, and never yet One day has risen up between The kisses of my earlier pet, And few the hours he was not seen. How can I call to you from Rome? Will mamma teach what babbo said? Have ye not heard him talk at home About the city of the dead? Marvellous tales will babbo tell, If you don't clasp his throat too tight, Tales which you, Arnold, will love well, Tho' Julia's cheek turns pale with fright. How, swimming o'er the Tiber, Clelia Headed the rescued virgin train; And, loftier virtue! how Cornelia Lived when her two brave sons were slain. This is my birthday: may ye waltze Till mamma cracks her best guitar! Yours are true pleasures; those are false We wise ones follow from afar. What shall I bring you? would you like Urn, image, glass, red, yellow, blue, Stricken by Time, who soon must strike As deep the heart that beats for you. CLXI. [The leaves are falling; so am I] The leaves are falling; so am I; The few late flowers have moisture in the eye; So have I too. Scarcely on any bough is heard Joyous, or even unjoyous, bird The whole wood through. Winter may come: he brings but nigher His circle (yearly narrowing) to the fire Where old friends meet: Let him; now heaven is overcast, And spring and summer both are past, And all things sweet. CLXII. [The place where soon I think to lie] The place where soon I think to lie, In its old creviced nook hard-by Rears many a weed: If parties bring you there, will you Drop slily in a grain or two Of wall-flower seed? I shall not see it, and (too sure!) I shall not ever hear that your Light step was there; But the rich odour some fine day Will, what I cannot do, repay That little care. CLXIII. [As he who baskt in sunshine loves to go] As he who baskt in sunshine loves to go Where in dim coolness graceful laurels grow; In that lone narrow path whose silent sand Hears of no footstep, while some gentle hand Beckons, or seems to beckon, to the seat Where ivied wall and trellised woodbine meet; Thus I, of ear that tingles not to praise, And feet that weary of the world's highways, Recline on mouldering tree or jutting stone, And (tho' at last I feel I am alone) Think by a gentle hand mine too is prest In kindly welcome to a calmer rest. CLXIV. [Love is like Echo in the land of Tell] Love is like Echo in the land of Tell, Who answers best the indweller of her bowers, Silent to other voices (idly loud Or wildly violent) letting them arouse Eagle or cavern'd brute, but never her. CLXV. ON RECEIVING A MONTHLY ROSE. Pæstum! thy roses long ago, All roses far above, Twice in the year were call'd to blow And braid the locks of Love. He saw the city sink in dust, Its rose's roots decay'd, And cried in sorrow, “Find I must Another for my braid.” First Cyprus, then the Syrian shore, To Pharpar's lucid rill, Did those two large dark eyes explore, But wanted something still. Damascus fill'd his heart with joy, So sweet her roses were! He cull'd them; but the wayward boy Thought them ill worth his care. “I want them every month,” he cried, “I want them every hour: Perennial rose, and none beside, Henceforth shall be my flower.” CLXVI. [Sweet was the song that Youth sang once] Sweet was the song that Youth sang once, And passing sweet was the response; But there are accents sweeter far When Love leaps down our evening star, Holds back the blighting wings of Time, Melts with his breath the crusty rime, And looks into our eyes, and says, “Come, let us talk of former days.” CLXVII. [Fate! I have askt few things of thee] Fate! I have askt few things of thee, And fewer have to ask. Shortly, thou knowest, I shall be No more: then con thy task. If one be left on earth so late Whose love is like the past, Tell her in whispers, gentle Fate! Not even love must last. Tell her I leave the noisy feast Of life, a little tired, Amid its pleasures few possest And many undesired. Tell her with steady pace to come And, where my laurels lie, To throw the freshest on the tomb, When it has caught her sigh. Tell her to stand some steps apart From others on that day, And check the tear (if tear should start) Too precious for dull clay. CLXVIII. TO A LADY ON COMING OF AGE. Fear not my frequent verse may raise To your clear brow the vulgar gaze. Another I reserve in store For day yet happier; then no more. Believe (youth's happy creed!) believe That never can bright morns deceive; That brighter must arise for you Than ever the proud sun rode through. It has been said, on wedlock-land Some paths are thorny, more are sand. I hope the coming spring may show How little they who say it, know. Meanwhile with tranquil breast survey The trophies of the present day. When twenty years their course have run, Anxious we wait the following one. Lo! Fortune in full pomp descends Surrounded by her host of friends, And Beauty moves, in passing by, With loftier port and steadier eye. Alas, alas! when these are flown, Shall there be nothing quite your own? Not Beauty from her stores can give The mighty charm that makes us live, Nor shieldless Fortune overcome The shadows that besiege the tomb. You, better guarded, may be sure Your name for ages will endure, While all the powerful, all the proud, All that excite the clamorous crowd, With truncheon or with diadem, Shall lie one mingled mass with them. Chide you our praises? You alone Can doubt of glories fairly won. Genius, altho' he seldom decks Where beauty does the softer sex, Approaches you with accents bland, Attunes your voice, directs your hand. And soon will fix upon your brow A crown as bright as Love does now. CLXIX. [Beauty! thou arbitress of weal or woe] Beauty! thou arbitress of weal or woe To others, but how powerless of thy own, How prone to fall on the smooth path, how prone To place thy tender foot on the sharp flint And bleed until the evening fade and die! I see thee happy now, and I rejoice, As if thou wert (almost as if!) for me: But thou hast tarried with me long enough, And now hast taken all thy gifts away. How various and how changeful is thy mien! Various and changeful as the neck of doves In colour: here so meek, so stately there; Here festive, and there sad; here, tall, erect, Commanding; there, small, slender, bent to yield. I have observ'd thee resolute and bold And stepping forth to conquer, and thy brow Rattling its laurel o'er the myrtle crown; Beauty! I now behold thee lower thine eyes And throw them forward on the ground, while two Close at thy side interrogate and plead. Others have done the same, but those were met Calmly, and smiles were cast indifferently Back into them; smiles that smote every heart, But most the heart they fell into that hour. It pleas'd me to behold it: we all love To see a little of the cruelty We could ill bear, and, when we read of, weep. Beauty! thou now art with that innocent Who seems of Love's own age, and Love's own power. Haply ere this there are upon the earth Some, by all hope abandoned, who ascend The highths of Himalaya; some who fight Where Napier's foot makes Hindus run straight on, And Kyber quails beneath his eagle eye; While others bear her on untiring breast To Zembla, and with iron that often breaks Engrave her name upon eternal ice. CLXX. [My guest! I have not led you thro'] My guest! I have not led you thro' The old footpath of swamp and sedges; But . . mind your step . . you're coming to Shingle and shells with sharpish edges. Here a squash jelly-fish, and here An old shark's head with open jaw We hap may hit on: never fear Scent rather rank and crooked saw. Step forward: we shall pass them soon, And then before you will arise A fertile scene; a placid moon Above, and star-besprinkled skies. And we shall reach at last (where ends The fields of thistles, sharp and light) A dozen brave and honest friends, And there wish one and all good-night. CLXXI. [O'erfoaming with rage] O'erfoaming with rage The foul-mouth'd judge Page Thus question'd a thief in the dock: “Didst never hear read In the church, lump of lead! Loose chip from the devil's own block! ‘Thou shalt not steal?’” “Yea,” The white chap did say, “‘Thou shalt not:’ but thou was the word. Had he piped out ‘Jem Hewitt! Be sure you don't do it,’ I'd ha' thought of it twice ere I did it, my lord.” CLXXII. ON A QUAKER'S TANKARD. Ye lie, friend Pindar! and friend Thales, Nothing so good as water? Ale is. CLXXIII. INVOCATION TO THE MUSE. Though Helicon! I seldom dream Aside thy lovely limpid stream, Nor glory that to me belong Or elegance or nerve of song, Or Hayley's easy-ambling horse, Or Peter Pindar's comic force, Or Mason's fine majestic flow, Or aught that pleases one in Crowe— Yet thus a saucy-suppliant bard! I court the Muse's kind regard. “O whether, Muse! thou please to give My humble verses long to live;” Or tell me “The decrees of Fate Have ordered them a shorter date.” I bow; yet O! may every word Survive, however, George III. CLXXIV. EPITHALAMIUM. Weep Venus, and ye Adorable Three Who Venus for ever environ. Pounds, shillings, and pence And shrewd sober sense Have clapt the strait waistcoat on ? Off Mainot and Turk With pistol and dirk, Nor palace nor pinnace set fire on The cord's fatal jerk Has done its last work And the noose is now slipped upon ? CLXXV. [Go on, go on, and love away!] Go on, go on, and love away! Mine was, another's is, the day. Go on, go on, thou false one! now Upon his shoulder rest thy brow, And look into his eyes until Thy own, to find them colder, fill. CLXXVI. [Ten thousand flakes about my windows blow] Ten thousand flakes about my windows blow, Some falling and some rising, but all snow. Scribblers and statesmen! are ye not just so? CLXXVII. OLD STYLE. Aurelius, Sire of Hungrinesses! Thee thy old friend Catullus blesses, And sends thee six fine watercresses. There are who would not think me quite (Unless we were old friends) polite To mention whom you should invite. Look at them well; and turn it o'er In your own mind . . I'd have but four . . Lucullus, Cæsar, and two more. CLXXVIII. SUGGESTED BY HORACE. Never, my boy, so blush and blink, Or care a straw what people think, If you by chance are seen to dally With that sweet little creature Sally. Lest by degrees you sidle from her, I'll quote you Ovid, Horace, Homer. If the two first are loose, there still is Authority in proud Achilles; And never, night or day, could be his Dignity hurt by dear Briseis. Altho' I take an interest In having you and Sally blest, I know those ancles small and round Are standing on forbidden ground, So fear no rivalry to you In gentlemen of thirty-two. CLXXIX. [An English boy, whose travels lay] An English boy, whose travels lay In Italy, had slept at night Sound as a bishop all the way, Till suddenly . . the strangest sight! Above the upper of the two Near ridges of old Apennine, (Seemingly scarce a good stone-throw) A lighted globe began to shine. “O father! father!” cried the lad, “What wicked boys are hereabout! How wild! how mischievous! how mad! Look yonder! let us put it out. I never saw such a balloon So near . . that olive now takes fire! The corn there crackles!” “'Tis the Moon,” Patting his head, replied the sire. CLXXX. [Pleasant it is to wink and sniff the fumes] Pleasant it is to wink and sniff the fumes The little dainty poet blows for us, Kneeling in his soft cushion at the hearth, And patted on the head by passing maids. Who would discourage him? who bid him off? Invidious or morose! Enough, to say (Perhaps too much unless 'tis mildly said) That slender twigs send forth the fiercest flame, Not without noise, but ashes soon succeed, While the broad chump leans back against the stones, Strong with internal fire, sedately breathed, And heats the chamber round from morn till night. CLXXXI. COTTAGE LEFT FOR LONDON. The covert walk, the mossy apple-trees, And the long grass that darkens underneath, I leave for narrow streets and gnats and fleas, Water unfit to drink and air to breathe. CLXXXII. [Come, Sleep! but mind ye! if you come without] Come, Sleep! but mind ye! if you come without The little girl that struck me at the rout, By Jove! I would not give you half-a-crown For all your poppy-heads and all your down. CLXXXIII. [Deep forests hide the stoutest oaks] Deep forests hide the stoutest oaks; Hazels make sticks for market-folks; He who comes soon to his estate Dies poor; the rich heir is the late. Sere ivy shaded Shakespeare's brow; But Matho is a poet now. CLXXXIV. [God's laws declare] God's laws declare Thou shalt not swear By aught in heaven above or earth below. Upon my honour! Melville cries; He swears, and lies; Does Melville then break God's commandment? No. CLXXXV. FLOWERS SENT IN BAY-LEAVES. I leave for you to disunite Frail flowers and lasting bays: One, let me hope, you'll wear to-night The other all your days. CLXXXVI. [“I'm half in love,” he who with smiles hath said] “I'm half in love,” he who with smiles hath said, In love will never be. Whoe'er, “I'm not in love,” and shakes his head, In love too sure is he. CLXXXVII. [“Fear God!” says Percival: and when you hear] “Fear God!” says Percival: and when you hear Tones so lugubrious, you perforce must fear: If in such awful accents he should say, “Fear lovely Innocence!” you'd run away. CLXXXVIII. [Two cackling mothers hatch two separate broods] Two cackling mothers hatch two separate broods Of patriots; neither shall infest my house. I shun the noisier, but I loathe far more Patriots with tags about their carcases Bedolled with bits of ribbon and rag-lace, Or dangling, dainty, jewel'd crucifix The puft heart's pride, and not its purifier. Limbs, lives, and fortunes, all before the king, Until he ask the hazard of the same; Then the two broods unite, one step, one voice, For their dear country in its sad estate. CLXXXIX. [Does it become a girl so wise] Does it become a girl so wise, So exquisite in harmonies, To ask me when do I intend To write a sonnet? What? my friend! A sonnet? Never. Rhyme o'erflows Italian, which hath scarcely prose; And I have larded full three-score With sorte, morte, cuor, amor. But why should we, altho' we have Enough for all things, gay or grave, Say, on your conscience, why should we Who draw deep seans along the sea, Cut them in pieces to beset The shallows with a cabbage-net? Now if you ever ask again A thing so troublesome and vain, By all your charms! before the morn, To show my anger and my scorn, First I will write your name a-top, Then from this very ink shall drop A score of sonnets; every one Shall call you star, or moon, or sun, Till, swallowing such warm-water verse, Even sonnet-sippers sicken worse. CXC. [Plants the most beauteous love the water's brink] Plants the most beauteous love the water's brink, Opening their bosoms at young Zephyr's sighs. Maidens, come hither: see with your own eyes How many are trod down, how many sink. CXCI. [Each year bears something from us as it flies] Each year bears something from us as it flies, We only blow it farther with our sighs. CXCII. [Idle and light are many things you see] Idle and light are many things you see In these my closing pages: blame not me. However rich and plenteous the repast, Nuts, almonds, biscuits, wafers, come at last. CXCIII. [In wrath a youth was heard to say] In wrath a youth was heard to say, “From girl so false I turn away. By all that's sacred ice shall burn And sun shall freeze ere I return.” But as he went, at least one finger Within her hand was found to linger; One foot, that should outstrip the wind, (But only one) drew loads behind. CXCIV. [I've never seen a book of late] I've never seen a book of late But there is in it palmy state. To realm or city you apply The palm, and think it raised thereby. Yet always does the palmy crown On every side hang loosely down, And its lank shade falls chiefly on Robber or reptile, sand or stone. Compare it with the Titan groves Where, east or west, the savage roves, Its highth and girth before them dwindle Into the measure of a spindle. But often you would make it bend To some young poet, if your friend. Look at it first, or you may fit Your poet-friend too well with it. The head of palm-tree is so-so, And bare or ragged all below. If it suits anything, I wist It suits the archæologist. To him apply the palmy state Whose fruit is nothing but a date. CXCV. A MASK ON A RING. Forster! you who never wore Any kind of mask before; Yet, by holy friendship! take This, and wear it for my sake. CXCVI. [I would give something, O Apollo!] I would give something, O Apollo! Thy radiant course o'er earth to follow, And fill it up with light and song, But rather would be always young. Since that perhaps thou canst not give, By me let those who love me live. CXCVII. [Alas, how soon the hours are over] Alas, how soon the hours are over Counted us out to play the lover! And how much narrower is the stage Allotted us to play the sage! But when we play the fool, how wide The theatre expands! beside, How long the audience sits before us! How many prompters! what a chorus! CXCVIII. [Is it not better at an early hour] Is it not better at an early hour In its calm cell to rest the weary head, While birds are singing and while blooms the bower, Than sit the fire out and go starv'd to bed? CXCIX. TO JULIUS HARE, WITH “PERICLES AND ASPASIA.” Julius, of three rare brothers, my fast friends, The latest known to me! Aspasia comes With him, high-helmeted and trumpet-tongued, Who loved her. Well thou knowest all his worth, Valuing him most for trophies reared to Peace, For generous friendships, like thy own, for Arts Ennobled by protection, not debased. Hence, worthless ones! throne-cushions, puft, inert, Verminous, who degrade with patronage Bargain'd for, ere dealt out! The stone that flew In splinters from the chisel when the hand Of Phidias wielded it, the chips of stone Weigh with me more than they do. To thy house Comes Pericles. Receive the friend of him Whose horses started from the Parthenon To traverse seas and neigh upon our strand. From pleasant Italy my varied page, Where many men and many ages meet, Julius! thy friendly hand long since received. Accept my last of labours and of thanks. He who held mute the joyous and the wise With wit and eloquence, whose tomb (afar From all his friends and all his countrymen) Saddens the light Palermo, to thy care Consign'd it; knowing that whate'er is great Needs not the looming of a darker age, Nor knightly mail nor scymetar begemm'd. Stepping o'er all this lumber, where the steel Is shell'd with rust, and the thin gold worm'd out From its meandering waves, he took the scroll, And read aloud what sage and poet spake In sunnier climes; thou heardest it well pleased; For Truth from conflict rises more elate And lifts a brighter torch, beheld by more. Call'd to befriend me by fraternal love, Thou pausedst in thy vigorous march amid The German forests of wide-branching thought, Deep, intricate, whence voices shook all France, Whence Blucher's soldiers heard the trumpet-tongue And knew the footstep of Tyrtæan Arndt. CC. TO SOUTHEY. There are who teach us that the depths of thought Engulph the poet; that irregular Is every greater one. Go, Southey! mount Up to these teachers; ask, submissively, Who so proportioned as the lord of day? Yet mortals see his stedfast stately course And lower their eyes before him. Fools gaze up Amazed at daring flights. Does Homer soar As hawks and kites and weaker swallows do? He knows the swineherd; he plants apple-trees Amid Alcinous's cypresses; He covers with his aged black-vein'd hand The plumy crest that frighten'd and made cling To its fond-mother the ill-fated child; He walks along Olympus with the Gods, Complacently and calmly, as along The sands where Simöis glides into the sea. They who step high and swing their arms, soon tire. The glorious Theban then? The sage from Thebes, Who sang his wisdom when the strife of cars And combatants had paus'd, deserves more praise Than this untrue one, fitter for the weak, Who by the lightest breezes are borne up And with the dust and straws are swept away; Who fancy they are carried far aloft When nothing quite distinctly they descry, Having lost all self-guidance. But strong men Are strongest with their feet upon the ground. Light-bodied Fancy, Fancy plover-winged, Draws some away from culture to dry downs Where none but insects find their nutriment; There let us leave them to their sleep and dreams. Great is that poet, great is he alone, Who rises o'er the creatures of the earth, Yet only where his eye may well discern The various movements of the human heart, And how each mortal differs from the rest. Although he struggle hard with Poverty, He dares assert his just prerogative To stand above all perishable things, Proclaiming this shall live, and this shall die. CCI. LINES ON THE DEATH OF CHARLES LAMB. Once, and once only, have I seen thy face, Elia! once only has thy tripping tongue Run o'er my breast, yet never has been left Impression on it stronger or more sweet. Cordial old man! what youth was in thy years, What wisdom in thy levity, what truth In every utterance of that purest soul! Few are the spirits of the glorified I'd spring to earlier at the gate of heaven. CCII. TO ANDREW JACKSON. Happy may be the land Where mortals with their eyes uplifted stand While Eloquence her thunder rolls: Happier, where no deceptive light Bursts upon Passion's stormy night, Guiding to rocks and shoals. Happiest of all, where Man shall lay His limbs at their full length, nor overcast The sky above his head, but the pure ray Shines brighter on the future than the past. Look, look into the east afar, Refulgent western Star! And where the fane of Pallas stands, Rear'd to her glory by his hands, Thou, altho' nowhere else, shalt see A statesman and a chief like thee. How rare the sight, how grand! Behold the golden scales of Justice stand Well balanced in a mailed hand! Following the calm Deliverer of Mankind, In thee again we find This spectacle renew'd. Glory altho' there be To leave thy country free, Glory had reacht not there her plenitude. Up, every son of Afric soil, Ye worn and weary hoist the sail, For your own glebes and garners toil With easy plough and lightsome flail: A father's home ye never knew, A father's home your sons shall have from you. Enjoy your palmy groves, your cloudless day, Your world that demons tore away. Look up! look up! the flaming sword Hath vanisht! and behold your Paradise restored. Never was word more bold Than through thy cities ran, Let gold be weighed for gold, Let man be weighed for man. Thou spakest it; and therefore praise Shall crown thy later as thy earlier days, And braid more lovely this last wreath shall bind. Where purest is the heart's atmosphere Atlantic Ruler! there Shall men discern at last the loftiest mind. Rise, and assert thy trust! Enforcing to be just, The race to whom alone Of Europe's sons was never known (In mart or glade) The image of the heavenly maid Astræa; she hath called thee; go Right onward, and with tranchant prow The hissing foam of Gallic faith cut thro'. CCIII. TO WORDSWORTH. Those who have laid the harp aside And turn'd to idler things, From very restlessness have tried The loose and dusty strings, And, catching back some favourite strain, Run with it o'er the chords again. But Memory is not a Muse, O Wordsworth! though 'tis said They all descend from her, and use To haunt her fountain-head: That other men should work for me In the rich mines of Poesie, Pleases me better than the toil Of smoothing under hardened hand, With attic emery and oil, The shining point for Wisdom's wand, Like those thou temperest 'mid the rills Descending from thy native hills. Without his governance, in vain Manhood is strong, and Youth is bold. If oftentimes the o'er-piled strain Clogs in the furnace, and grows cold Beneath his pinions deep and frore, And swells and melts and flows no more, That is because the heat beneath Pants in its cavern poorly fed. Life springs not from the couch of Death, Nor Muse nor Grace can raise the dead; Unturn'd then let the mass remain, Intractable to sun or rain. A marsh, where only flat leaves lie, And showing but the broken sky, Too surely is the sweetest lay That wins the ear and wastes the day, Where youthful Fancy pouts alone And lets not Wisdom touch her zone. He who would build his fame up high, The rule and plummet must apply, Nor say, “I'll do what I have plann'd,” Before he try if loam or sand Be still remaining in the place Delved for each polisht pillar's base. With skilful eye and fit device Thou raisest every edifice, Whether in sheltered vale it stand Or overlook the Dardan strand, Amid the cypresses that mourn Laodameia's love forlorn. We both have run o'er half the space Listed for mortal's earthly race; We both have crost life's fervid line, And other stars before us shine: May they be bright and prosperous As those that have been stars for us! Our course by Milton's light was sped, And Shakespeare shining overhead: Chatting on deck was Dryden too, The Bacon of the rhyming crew; None ever crost our mystic sea More richly stored with thought than he; Tho' never tender nor sublime, He wrestles with and conquers Time. To learn my lore on Chaucer's knee, I left much prouder company; Thee gentle Spenser fondly led, But me he mostly sent to bed. I wish them every joy above That highly blessed spirits prove, Save one: and that too shall be theirs, But after many rolling years, When 'mid their light thy light appears. CCIV. TO THE COMTESSE DE MOLANDE, ABOUT TO MARRY THE DUC DE LUXEMBOURG. Say ye that years roll on and ne'er return? Say ye the Sun who leaves them all behind, Their great creator, can not bring one back With all his force, tho' he draw worlds around? Witness me, little streams that meet before My happy dwelling; witness Africo And Mensola! that ye have seen at once Twenty roll back, twenty as swift and bright As are your swiftest and your brightest waves, When the tall cypress o'er the Doccia Hurls from his inmost boughs the latent snow. Go, and go happy, light of my past days, Consoler of my present! thou whom Fate Alone could sever from me! One step higher Must yet be mounted, high as was the last: Friendship with faltering accent says “Depart, And take the highest seat below the crown'd.” CCV. TO THE COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON. Since in the terrace-bower we sate While Arno gleam'd below, And over sylvan Massa late Hung Cynthia's slender bow, Years after years have past away Less light and gladsome; why Do those we most implore to stay Run ever swiftest by! CCVI. [Unjust are they who argue me unjust] Unjust are they who argue me unjust To thee, O France! Did ever man delight More cordially in him who held the hearts Of beasts to his, and searcht into them all, And took their wisdom, giving it profuse To man, who gave them little in return, And only kept their furs and teeth and claws. What comic scenes are graceful, saving thine? Where is philosophy like thy Montaigne's? Religion, like thy Fenelon's? Sublime In valour's self-devotion were thy men, Thy women far sublimer: but foul stains At last thou bearest on thy plume; thy steps Follow false honour, deviating from true. A broken word bears on it worse disgrace Than broken sword; erewhile thou knewest this. Thou huggest thy enslaver: on his tomb What scrolls! what laurels! Are there any bound About the braver Corday's? Is one hymn Chaunted in prayers or praises to the Maid To whom all maidens upon earth should bend, Who at the gate of Orleans broke thy chain? CCVII. TO LADY CHARLES BEAUCLERK. No, Teresita, never say That uncle Landor's worthless lay Shall find its place among your treasures. Altho' his heart is not grown old, Yet are his verses far too cold For bridal bowers or festive measures. He knows you lovely, thinks you wise, And still shall think so if your eyes Seek not in noiser paths to roam; But rest upon your forest-green, And find that life runs best between A tender love and tranquil home. CCVIII. TO MY DAUGHTER. By that dejected city Arno runs Where Ugolino claspt his famisht sons; There wert thou born, my Julia! there thine eyes Return'd as bright a blue to vernal skies; And thence, sweet infant wanderer! when the Spring Advanced, the Hours brought thee on silent wing, Brought (while anemones were quivering round, And pointed tulips pierced the purple ground) Where stands fair Florence: there thy voice first blest My ears, and sank like balm into my breast. For many griefs had wounded it, and more Thy little hands could lighten, were in store. But why revert to griefs? thy sculptur'd brow Dispels from mine its darkest cloud even now. What then the bliss to see again thy face And all that rumour has announced of grace! I urge with fevered breast the coming day . . O could I sleep and wake again in May! CCIX. TO ANDREW CROSSE. Altho' with Earth and Heaven you deal As equal, and without appeal, And bring beneath your ancient roof Records of all they do, and proof, No right have you, sequester'd Crosse, To make the Muses weep your loss. A poet were you long before Gems from the struggling air you tore, And bade the far-off flashes play About your woods, and light your way. With languor and disease opprest, And years, that crush the tuneful breast, Southey, the pure of soul is mute! Hoarse whistles Wordsworth's watery flute, Which mourn'd with loud indignant strains The famisht Black in Corsic chains: Nor longer do the girls for Moore Jilt Horace as they did before. He sits contented to have won The rose-wreath from Anacreon, And bears to see the orbs grow dim That shone with blandest light on him. Others there are whose future day No slender glories shall display; But you would think me worse than tame To find me stringing name on name, And I would rather call aloud On Andrew Crosse than stem the crowd. Now chiefly female voices rise (And sweet are they) to cheer our skies. Suppose you warm these chilly days With samples from your fervid lays. Come! courage! man! and don't pretend That every verse cuts off a friend, And that in simple truth you fain Would rather not give poets pain. The lame excuse will never do . . Philosophers can envy too. CCX. TO A LADY. Sweet are the siren songs on eastern shores, To songs as sweet are pulled our English oars: And farther upon ocean venture forth The lofty sails that leave the wizard north. Altho' by fits so dense a cloud of smoke Puffs from his sappy and ill-season'd oak, Yet, as the Spirit of the Dream draws near, Remembered loves make Byron's self sincere. The puny heart within him swells to view, The man grows loftier and the poet too. When War sweeps nations down with iron wings, Alcæus never sang as Campbell sings; And, caught by playful wit and graceful lore, The Muse invoked by Horace bends to Moore. Theirs, not my verses, come I to repeat, So draw the footstool nearer to your feet. CCXI. TO CZARTORYSKI, ATTENDING ON FOOT THE FUNERAL OF THE POET MENINCIVICZ. In Czartoryski I commend The patriot's guide, the poet's friend. King, sprung of kings, yet great and good As any pure from royal blood; O'er genius not ashamed to bear The pall, or shed at home the tear. Thou, who hast shown us how the great Are greater in their fallen state, Another rare example give . . That kings, uncurst by men, may live, And Poland by thy light shall see One nation in wide Europe free. CCXII. TO MY DAUGHTER IN ITALY, AT CHRISTMAS. Where is, ah where! the citron bloom That threw its fragrance o'er my room? Where, white magnolia-cup entwined With pliant myrtle's ruddy rind? Julia, with you the flowers are gay, And cluster round the shortest day Little at Fiesole ye know Of holly, less of mistleto; Such as the Druid priest of yore To grim god-monsters grimly bore. Run: from her pouting infants call The musk-rose at our chapel-wall; Run, bring the violets up, that blow Along the banks of Africo; And tell them, every soul, they must Bend their coy heads and kiss my bust. Christmas is come: on such a day Give the best thoughts fair room for play, And all the Sabbath dance and sing In honour of your new-born king. CCXIII. TO MISS ISABELLA PERCY. If that old hermit laid to rest Beneath your chapel-floor, Could leave the regions of the blest And visit earth once more: If human sympathies could warm His tranquil breast again, Your innocence that breast could charm, Perhaps your beauty pain. CCXIV. TO CHARLES DICKENS. Go then to Italy; but mind To leave the pale low France behind; Pass through that country, nor ascend The Rhine, nor over Tyrol wend: Thus all at once shall rise more grand The glories of the ancient land. Dickens! how often when the air Breath'd genially, I've thought me there, And rais'd to heaven my thankful eyes To see three spans of deep blue skies. In Genoa now I hear a stir, A shout . . Here comes the Minister! Yes, thou art he, although not sent By cabinet or parliament: Yes, thou art he. Since Milton's youth Bloom'd in the Eden of the South, Spirit so pure and lofty none Hath heavenly Genius from his throne Deputed on the banks of Thames To speak his voice and urge his claims. Let every nation know from thee How less than lovely Italy Is the whole world beside; let all Into their grateful breasts recall How Prospero and Miranda dwelt In Italy: the griefs that melt The stoniest heart, each sacred tear One lacrymatory gathered here; All Desdemona's, all that fell In playful Juliet's bridal cell. Ah! could my steps in life's decline Accompany or follow thine! But my own vines are not for me To prune, or from afar to see. I miss the tales I used to tell With cordial Hare and joyous Gell, And that good old Archbishop whose Cool library, at evening's close (Soon as from Ischia swept the gale And heav'd and left the dark'ning sail) Its lofty portal opened wide To me, and very few beside: Yet large his kindness. Still the poor Flock round Taranto's palace-door, And find no other to replace The noblest of a noble race. Amid our converse you would see Each with white cat upon his knee, And flattering that grand company: For Persian kings might proudly own Such glorious cats to share the throne. Write me few letters: I'm content With what for all the world is meant; Write then for all: but, since my breast Is far more faithful than the rest, Never shall any other share With little Nelly nestling there. CCXV. TO SOUTHEY, 1833. Indweller of a peaceful vale, Ravaged erewhile by white-hair'd Dane; Rare architect of many a wondrous tale, Which, till Helvellyn's head lie prostrate, shall remain! From Arno's side I hear thy Derwent flow, And see methinks the lake below Reflect thy graceful progeny, more fair And radiant than the purest waters are, Even when gurgling in their joy among The bright and blessed throng Whom, on her arm recline, The beauteous Proserpine With tenderest regretful gaze, Thinking of Enna's yellow field, surveys. Alas! that snows are shed Upon thy laurel'd head, Hurtled by many cares and many wrongs! Malignity lets none Approach the Delphic throne; A hundred lane-fed curs bark down Fame's hundred tongues. But this is in the night, when men are slow To raise their eyes, when high and low, The scarlet and the colourless, are one: Soon Sleep unbars his noiseless prison, And active minds again are risen; Where are the curs? dream-bound, and whimpering in the sun. At fife's or lyre's or tabor's sound The dance of youth, O Southey, runs not round, But closes at the bottom of the room Amid the falling dust and deepening gloom, Where the weary sit them down, And Beauty too unbraids, and waits a lovelier crown. We hurry to the river we must cross, And swifter downward every footstep wends; Happy, who reach it ere they count the loss Of half their faculties and half their friends! When we are come to it, the stream Is not so dreary as they deem Who look on it from haunts too dear; The weak from Pleasure's baths feel most its chilling air! No firmer breast than thine hath Heaven To poet, sage, or hero given: No heart more tender, none more just To that He largely placed in trust: Therefore shalt thou, whatever date Of years be thine, with soul elate Rise up before the Eternal throne, And hear, in God's own voice, “Well done.” Not, were that submarine Gem-lighted city mine, Wherein my name, engraven by thy hand, Above the royal gleam of blazonry shall stand; Not, were all Syracuse Pour'd forth before my Muse, With Hiero's cars and steeds, and Pindar's lyre Brightening the path with more than solar fire, Could I, as would beseem, requite the praise Showered upon my low head from thy most lofty lays. CCXVI. TO BARRY CORNWALL. Barry! your spirit long ago Has haunted me; at last I know The heart it sprung from: one more sound Ne'er rested on poetic ground. But, Barry Cornwall! by what right Wring you my breast and dim my sight, And make me wish at every touch My poor old hand could do as much? No other in these later times Has bound me in so potent rhymes. I have observed the curious dress And jewelry of brave Queen Bess, But always found some o'ercharged thing, Some flaw in even the brightest ring, Admiring in her men of war, A rich but too argute guitar. Our foremost now are more prolix, And scrape with three-fell fiddlesticks, And, whether bound for griefs or smiles, Are slow to turn as crocodiles. Once, every court and country bevy Chose the gallant of loins less heavy, And would have laid upon the shelf Him who could talk but of himself. Reason is stout, but even Reason May walk too long in Rhyme's hot season. I have heard many folks aver They have caught horrid colds with her. Imagination's paper kite, Unless the string is held in tight, Whatever fits and starts it takes, Soon bounces on the ground, and breaks. You, placed afar from each extreme, Nor dully drowse nor wildly dream, But, ever flowing with good-humour, Are bright as spring and warm as summer. Mid your Penates not a word Of scorn or ill-report is heard; Nor is there any need to pull A sheaf or truss from cart too full, Lest it overload the horse, no doubt, Or clog the road by falling out. We, who surround a common table, And imitate the fashionable, Wear each two eye-glasses: this lens Shows us our faults, that other men's. We do not care how dim may be This by whose aid our own we see But, ever anxiously alert That all may have their whole desert, We would melt down the stars and sun In our heart's furnace, to make one Thro' which the enlighten'd world might spy A mote upon a brother's eye. CCXVII. TO MAJOR-GENERAL W. NAPIER. Napier! take up anew thy pen, To mark the deeds of mighty men. And whose more glorious canst thou trace Than heroes of thy name and race? No other house hath ever borne So many of them to adorn The annals of our native land In virtue, wisdom, and command. But foremost, and to thee most near, Is he who vanquisht the Ameer. And when before his feet was laid By fallen power the thirteenth blade, With every hilt more rich in gems Than Europe's kingly diadems, Then, and then only did he stoop To take the spoils of victory up, That he might render each again To hands which wielded them in vain. “Is this the race of Clive?” cried they: “Did Hastings exercise such sway?” They since have seen him rais'd not more In pride or splendour than before, And studious but to leave behind The blessing of just laws to Scinde. Therefore do thou, if health permit, Add one page more to Holy Writ. Such is the page wherein are shown The fragments of a bloody throne, And peace and happiness restor'd By their old enemy the sword. Hasten, my friend, the work begun, For daily dimmer grows our sun, And age, if farther off from thee, Creeps on, though imperceptibly. Some call him slow, some find him fast, But all he overtakes at last, Unless they run and will not wait, But overleap life's flower-twined gate. We may not leave the lighted town Again to tread our turfy down, Thence tracing Avon's misty white, The latest object seiz'd by Night, Nor part at Claverton when Jove Is the sole star we see above; Yet friends for evermore. If War Had rear'd me a triumphal car, Imperfect would have been my pride Unless he plac'd thee close beside, And shouts like these the skies might rend, “See the brave man he chose for friend!” CCXVIII. TO MATHEW AND WOLFF. Who are those men that pass us? men well-girt For voyaging; of aspect meek, of breath Ardent, of eyes that only look to heaven. I must perforce abase before them mine, Unworthy to behold them; I must check Praise, which they would not from men's lip receive, But that men call for it, throughout all lands, Throughout all ages. Hail, deliverers From sin, from every other thraldom! Hail Theobald! his true servant. Nor do thou Suspend thy step, urged by God's voice, to press Past Taurus, past the Caspian, past the groves Of Samarcand, thrilling with Persian song, To where Bokhara's noisome prisons hold Indomitable hearts, to perish there Unless thou save them: but thine too may rot Beside them, whether timely or too late Thou plungest into that deep well of woe. Wolff! there was one who bore thy glorious name Before thee; one who rais'd from foul disgrace The British flag, and won the western world: Brave man! and happy in his death! but thou In life art happier nor less brave than he. I will believe that Christianity (Merciful God! forgive the manifold Adulteries with her valets and her grooms, Rank gardeners and wheezing manciples!) Is now of service to the earth she curst With frauds perpetual, intermittent fires, And streams of blood that intersect the globe: I will believe it: none shall kill my faith While men like thee are with us. Kings conspire Against their God, and raise up images Arrayed in purple all befringed with gold, For blindfold men to worship, and ordain That flocks and herds and corn, nay, common grass, Nay, what the rivers and the seas throw up, Be laid before them for their revelry. The twisted columns are grand ornaments; Yet all their foliage, all their fruitage, lends Support but feeble to the dome above. Ye pass bareheaded under open heaven, Under the torrid and the frozen sky, To preach the word of truth, to snatch the soul From death, the captive from his double chain: Therefore be glory to you both on high, On earth (what none so deeply sigh for) peace! CCXIX. TO JOHN KENYON. So, Kenyon, thou lover of frolic and laughter, We meet in a place where we never were sad. But who knows what destiny waits us hereafter, How little or much of the pleasures we had! The leaves of perhaps our last autumn are falling; Half-spent is the fire that may soon cease to burn; How many are absent who heed not our calling! Alas, and how many who can not return! Now, ere you are one of them, puff from before you The sighs and entreaties that sadden Torquay: A score may cling round you, and one may adore you; If so, the more reason to hurry away. CCXX. TO ROBERT BROWNING. There is delight in singing, tho' none hear Beside the singer; and there is delight In praising, tho' the praiser sit alone And see the prais'd far off him, far above. Shakespeare is not our poet, but the world's, Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee, Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, No man hath walkt along our roads with step So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue So varied in discourse. But warmer climes Give brighter plumage, stronger wing: the breeze Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne on Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where The Siren waits thee, singing song for song. CCXXI. TO THE SISTER OF ELIA. Comfort thee, O thou mourner, yet awhile! Again shall Elia's smile Refresh thy heart, where heart can ache no more. What is it we deplore? He leaves behind him, freed from griefs and years, Far worthier things than tears. The love of friends without a single foe: Unequalled lot below! His gentle soul, his genius, these are thine; For these dost thou repine? He may have left the lowly walks of men; Left them he has; what then? Are not his footsteps followed by the eyes Of all the good and wise? Tho' the warm day is over, yet they seek Upon the lofty peak Of his pure mind the roseate light that glows O'er death's perennial snows. Behold him! from the region of the blest He speaks: he bids thee rest. CCXXII. TO JOSEPH ABLETT. Lord of the Celtic dells, Where Clwyd listens as his minstrel tells Of Arthur, or Pendragon, or perchance The plumes of flashy France, Or, in dark region far across the main, Far as Grenada in the world of Spain, Warriors untold to Saxon ear, Until their steel-clad spirits reappear; How happy were the hours that held Thy friend (long absent from his native home) Amid thy scenes with thee! how wide a-field From all past cares and all to come! What hath Ambition's feverish grasp, what hath Inconstant Fortune, panting Hope; What Genius, that should cope With the heart-whispers in that path Winding so idly, where the idler stream Flings at the white-hair'd poplars gleam for gleam? Ablett, of all the days My sixty summers ever knew, Pleasant as there have been no few, Memory not one surveys Like those we spent together. Wisely spent Are they alone that leave the soul content. Together we have visited the men Whom Pictish pirates vainly would have drown'd; Ah, shall we ever clasp the hand again That gave the British harp its truest sound? Live, Derwent's guest! and thou by Grasmere springs! Serene creators of immortal things. And live too thou for happier days Whom Dryden's force and Spenser's fays Have heart and soul possest: Growl in grim London he who will, Revisit thou Maiano's hill, And swell with pride his sun-burnt breast. Old Redi in his easy chair With varied chant awaits thee there, And here are voices in the grove Aside my house, that make me think Bacchus is coming down to drink To Ariadne's love. But whither am I borne away From thee, to whom began my lay? Courage! I am not yet quite lost; I stept aside to greet my friends; Believe me, soon the greeting ends, I know but three or four at most. Deem not that Time hath borne too hard Upon the fortunes of thy bard, Leaving me only three or four: 'Tis my old number; dost thou start At such a tale? in what man's heart Is there fireside for more? I never courted friends or Fame; She pouted at me long, at last she came, And threw her arms around my neck and said, “Take what hath been for years delay'd, And fear not that the leaves will fall One hour the earlier from thy coronal.” Ablett! thou knowest with what even hand I waved away the offer'd seat Among the clambering, clattering, stilted great, The rulers of our land; Nor crowds nor kings can lift me up, Nor sweeten Pleasure's purer cup. Thou knowest how, and why, are dear to me My citron groves of Fiesole, My chirping Affrico, my beechwood nook, My Naiads, with feet only in the brook, Which runs away and giggles in their faces, Yet there they sit, nor sigh for other places. 'Tis not Pelasgian wall, By him made sacred whom alone 'Twere not profane to call The bard divine, nor (thrown Far under me) Valdarno, nor the crest Of Vallombrosa in the crimson east. Here can I sit or roam at will; Few trouble me, few wish me ill, Few come across me, few too near; Here all my wishes make their stand; Here ask I no one's voice or hand; Scornful of favour, ignorant of fear. Yon vine upon the maple bough Flouts at the hearty wheat below; Away her venal wines the wise man sends, While those of lower stem he brings From inmost treasure vault, and sings Their worth and age among his chosen friends. Behold our Earth, most nigh the sun Her zone least opens to the genial heat, But farther off her veins more freely run: 'Tis thus with those who whirl about the great; The nearest shrink and shiver, we remote May open-breasted blow the pastoral oat. CCXXIII. TO EMMA ISOLA. Etrurian domes, Pelasgian walls, Sive fountains, with their nymphs around, Terraced and citron-scented halls, Skies smiling upon scented walls; The giant Alps, averse to France, Pant with impatient pride to those, Calling the Briton to advance Amid eternal rocks and snows. I dare not bid him stay behind, I dare not tell him where to see The fairest form, the purest mind, Ansomia! that ere sprang from thee. CCXXIV. TO A PAINTER. Conceal not Time's misdeeds, but on my brow Retrace his mark: Let the retiring hair be silvery now That once was dark: Eyes that reflected images too bright Let clouds o'ercast, And from the tablet be abolisht quite The cheerful past. Yet Care's deep lines should one from waken'd Mirth Steal softly o'er, Perhaps on me the fairest of the Earth, May glance once more. CCXXV. FOR AN EPITAPH AT FIESOLE. Lo! where the four mimosas blend their shade In calm repose at last is Landor laid, For ere he slept he saw them planted here By her his soul had ever held most dear, And he had lived enough when he had dried her tear. CCXXVI. TO A BRIDE, FEB. 17, 1846. A still, serene, soft day; enough of sun To wreathe the cottage smoke like pine-tree snow, Whiter than those white flowers the bride-maids wore; Upon the silent boughs the lissom air Rested; and, only when it went, they moved, Nor more than under linnet springing off. Such was the wedding morn: the joyous Year Lept over March and April up to May. Regent of rising and of ebbing hearts, Thyself borne on in cool serenity, All heaven around and bending over thee, All earth below and watchful of thy course! Well hast thou chosen, after long demur To aspirations from more realms than one. Peace be with those thou leavest! peace with thee! Is that enough to wish thee? not enough, But very much: for Love himself feels pain, While brighter plumage shoots, to shed last year's; And one at home (how dear that one!) recalls Thy name, and thou recallest one at home. Yet turn not back thine eyes; the hour of tears Is over; nor believe thou that Romance Closes against pure Faith her rich domain. Shall only blossoms flourish there? Arise, Far-sighted bride! look forward! clearer views And higher hopes lie under calmer skies. Fortune in vain call'd out to thee; in vain Rays from high regions darted; Wit pour'd out His sparkling treasures; Wisdom laid his crown Of richer jewels at thy reckless feet. Well hast thou chosen. I repeat the words, Adding as true ones, not untold before, That incense must have fire for its ascent, Else 'tis inert and can not reach the idol. Youth is the sole equivalent of youth. Enjoy it while it lasts; and last it will; Love can prolong it in despite of Years. CCXXVII. TO JOHN FORSTER. Forster! whose zeal hath seiz'd each written page That fell from me, and over many lands Hath clear'd for me a broad and solid way, Whence one more age, aye, haply more than one, May be arrived at (all through thee), accept No false or faint or perishable thanks. From better men, and greater, friendship turn'd Thy willing steps to me. From Eliot's cell Death-dark, from Hampden's sadder battle-field, From steadfast Cromwell's tribunitian throne, Loftier than kings' supported knees could mount, Hast thou departed with me, and hast climbed Cecropian highths, and ploughed Ægean waves. Therefore it never grieved me when I saw That she who guards those regions and those seas Hath lookt with eyes more gracious upon thee. There are no few like that conspirator Who, under prètext of power-worship, fell At Cæsar's feet, only to hold him down While others stabb'd him with repeated blows: And there are more who fling light jibes, immerst In gutter-filth, against the car that mounts Weighty with triumph up the Sacred Way. Protect in every place my stranger guests, Born in the lucid land of free pure song, Now first appearing on repulsive shores, Bleak, and where safely none but natives move, Red-poll'd, red-handed, siller-grasping men. Ah! lead them far away, for they are used To genial climes and gentle speech; but most Cymodameia: warn the Tritons off While she ascends, while through the opening plain Of the green sea (brighten'd by bearing it) Gushes redundantly her golden hair. POEMS FROM PERICLES AND ASPASIA AND OTHER PROSE WORKS. PERICLES TO ASPASIA. Flower of Ionia's fertile plains, Where Pleasure leagued with Virtue reigns, Where the Pierian Maids of old, Yea, long ere Ilion's tale was told, Too pure, too sacred for our sight, Descended with the silent night To young Arctinus, and Mæander Delay'd his course for Melesander! If there be city on the earth Proud in the children of her birth, Wealth, science, beauty, story, song, These to Miletus all belong. To fix the diadem on his brow For ever, one was wanting . . thou. SOCRATES TO ASPASIA. He who stole fire from heaven, Long heav'd his bold and patient breast; 'twas riven By the Caucasian bird and bolts of Jove. Stolen that fire have I, And am enchain'd to die By every jealous Power that frowns above. I call not upon thee again To hear my vows and calm my pain, Who sittest high enthron'd Where Venus rolls her gladsome star, Propitious Love! But thou disown'd By sire and mother, whosoe'er they are, Unblest in form and name, Despair! Why dost thou follow that bright demon? why His purest altar art thou always nigh? ASPASIA TO SOCRATES. O thou who sittest with the wise, And searchest higher lore, And openest regions to their eyes Unvisited before! I'd run to loose thee if I could, Nor let the vulture taste thy blood. But, pity! pity! Attic bee! 'Tis happiness forbidden me. Despair is not for good or wise, And should not be for love; We all must bear our destinies And bend to those above. Birds flying o'er the stormy seas Alight upon their proper trees. Yet wisest men not always know Where they should stop or whither go. CORINNA TO TANAGRA. From Athens. Tanagra! think not I forget Thy beautifully storied streets; Be sure my memory bathes yet In clear Thermodon, and yet greets The blithe and liberal shepherd-boy, Whose sunny bosom swells with joy When we accept his matted rushes Upheav'd with sylvan fruit; away he bounds, and blushes. A gift I promise: one I see Which thou with transport wilt receive, The only proper gift for thee, Of which no mortal shall bereave In later times thy mouldering walls, Until the last old turret falls; A crown, a crown from Athens won, A crown no God can wear, beside Latona's son. There may be cities who refuse To their own child the honours due, And look ungently on the Muse; But ever shall those cities rue The dry, unyielding, niggard breast, Offering no nourishment, no rest, To that young head which soon shall rise Disdainfully, in might and glory, to the skies. Sweetly where cavern'd Dirce flows Do white-arm'd maidens chaunt my lay, Flapping the while with laurel-rose The honey-gathering tribes away; And sweetly, sweetly Attic tongues Lisp your Corinna's early songs; To her with feet more graceful come The verses that have dwelt in kindred breasts at home. O let thy children lean aslant Against the tender mother's knee, And gaze into her face, and want To know what magic there can be In words that urge some eyes to dance, While others as in holy trance Look up to heaven: be such my praise! Why linger? I must haste, or lose the Delphic bays. FROM MIMNERMUS. I wish not Thasos rich in mines, Nor Naxos girt around with vines, Nor Crete nor Samos, the abodes Of those who govern men and gods, Nor wider Lydia, where the sound Of tymbrels shakes the thymy ground, And with white feet and with hoofs cloven The dedal dance is spun and woven: Meanwhile each prying younger thing Is sent for water to the spring, Under where red Priapus rears His club amid the junipers. In this whole world enough for me Is any spot the Gods decree; Albeit the pious and the wise Would tarry where, like mulberries, In the first hour of ripeness fall The tender creatures one and all. To take what falls with even mind Jove wills, and we must be resign'd. HEGEMON TO PRAXINOE. Is there any season, O my soul, When the sources of bitter tears dry up, And the uprooted flowers take their places again Along the torrent bed? Could I wish to live, it would be for that season, To repose my limbs and press my temples there. But should I not speedily start away In the hope to trace and follow thy steps! Thou art gone, thou art gone, Praxinöe! And hast taken far from me thy lovely youth, Leaving me naught that was desirable in mine. Alas! alas! what hast thou left me? The helplessness of childhood, the solitude of age, The laughter of the happy, the pity of the scorner, A colourless and broken shadow am I, Seen glancing in troubled waters. My thoughts too are scattered; thou hast cast them off; They beat against thee, they would cling to thee, But they are viler than the loose dark weeds, Without a place to root or rest in. I would throw them across my lyre; they drop from it; My lyre will sound only two measures; That Pity will never, never come, Or come to the sleep that awakeneth not unto her. FROM MYRTIS. Artemia, while Arion sighs, Raising her white and taper finger, Pretends to loose, yet makes to linger, The ivy that o'ershades her eyes. “Wait, or you shall not have the kiss,” Says she; but he, on wing to pleasure, “Are there not other hours for leisure? For love is any hour like this?” Artemia! faintly thou respondest, As falsely deems that fiery youth; A God there is who knows the truth, A God who tells me which is fondest. TO EROS. Tell me (if ever, Eros! are reveal'd Thy secrets to the earth) have they been true To any love who speak about the first? What! shall these holier lights, like twinkling stars In the few hours assign'd them, change their place, And, when comes ampler splendour, disappear? Idler I am, and pardon, not reply, Implore from thee, thus questioned; well I know Thou strikest, like Olympian Jove, but once. THE DEATH OF ARTEMIDORA. “Artemidora! Gods invisible, While thou art lying faint along the couch, Have tied the sandal to thy veined feet, And stand beside thee, ready to convey Thy weary steps where other rivers flow. Refreshing shades will waft thy weariness Away, and voices like thine own come nigh, Soliciting, nor vainly, thy embrace.” Artemidora sighed, and would have press'd The hand now pressing hers, but was too weak. Fate's shears were over her dark hair unseen While thus Elpenor spake: he look'd into Eyes that had given light and life erewhile To those above them, those now dim with tears And watchfulness. Again he spake of joy Eternal. At that word, that sad word, joy, Faithful and fond her bosom heav'd once more, Her head fell back: one sob, one loud deep sob Swell'd through the darken'd chamber; 'twas not hers: With her that old boat incorruptible, Unwearied, undiverted in its course, Had plash'd the water up the farther strand. ALETHEIA TO PHRAORTES. Phraortes! where art thou? The flames were panting after us, their darts Had pierced to many hearts Before the Gods, who heard nor prayer nor vow; Temples had sunk to earth, and other smoke O'er riven altars broke Than curled from myrrh and nard, When like a God among Arm'd hosts and unarm'd throng Thee I discern'd, implored, and caught one brief regard. Thou passest: from thy side Sudden two bowmen ride And hurry me away. Thou and all hope were gone . . They loos'd me . . and alone In a closed tent 'mid gory arms I lay. How did my tears then burn When, dreading thy return, Behold thee reappear! Nor helm nor sword nor spear . . In violet gold-hemm'd vest Thou camest forth; too soon! Fallen at thy feet, claspt to thy breast, I struggle, sob, and swoon. “O send me to my mother! bid her come And take my last farewell! One blow! . . enough for both . . one tomb . . 'Tis there our happy dwell.” Thou orderest: call'd and gone At once they are who breathe for thy command. Thou stoodest nigh me, soothing every moan, And pressing in both thine my hand. Then, and then only, when it tore My hair to hide my face; And gently did thy own bend o'er The abject head war-doomed to dire disgrace. Ionian was thy tongue, And when thou badest me to raise That head, nor fear in aught thy gaze, I dared look up . . but dared not long. “Wait, maiden, wait! if none are here Bearing a charm to charm a tear, There may (who knows?) be found at last Some solace for the sorrow past.” My mother, ere the sounds had ceas'd, Burst in, and drew me down: Her joy o'erpowered us both, her breast Covered lost friends and ruin'd town. Sweet thought! but yielding now To many harsher! By what blow Art thou dissevered from me? War, That hath career'd too far, Closeth his pinions. “Come, Phraortes, come To thy fond friends at home!” Thus beckons Love. Away then, wishes wild! O may thy mother be as blest As one whose eyes will sink to rest Blessing thee for her rescued child! Ungenerous still my heart must be: Throughout the young and festive train Which thou revisitest again May none be happier (this I fear) than she! TO ARDALIA. Life passes not as some men say, If you will only urge his stay, And treat him kindly all the while. He flies the dizzy strife of towns, Cowers before thunder-bearing frowns, But freshens up again at song and smile. Ardalia! we will place him here, And promise that nor sigh nor tear Shall ever trouble his repose. What precious zeal will you impress To ratify his happiness? That rose thro' which you breathe? Come, bring that rose. WAR. War is it, O grave heads! that ye With stern and stately pomp decree? Inviting all the Gods from far To join you in the game of war! Have ye then lived so many years To find no purer joy than tears? And seek ye now the highest good In strife, in anguish, and in blood? Your wisdom may be more than ours, But you have spent your golden hours, And have methinks but little right To make the happier fret and fight. Ah! when will come the calmer day When these dark clouds shall pass away? When (should two cities disagree) The young, the beauteous, and the free, Rushing with all their force, shall meet And struggle with embraces sweet, Till they who may have suffer'd most Give in, and own the battle lost. CUPID TEARING A ROSE-BUD. Ah, Cupid! Cupid! let alone That bud above the rest: The Graces wear it in their zone, Thy mother on her breast. Does it not grieve thee to destroy So beautiful a flower? If thou must do it, cruel boy, Far distant be the hour! If the sweet bloom (so tinged with fire From thy own torch) must die, Let it, O generous Love! expire Beneath a lover's sigh. A FAUN TO ERIOPIS. Tell me, Eriopis, why Lies in shade that languid eye? Hast thou caught the hunter's shout Far from Dian, and without Any sister nymph to say Whither leads the downward way? Trust me: never be afraid Of thy Faun, my little maid! He will never call thee Dear, Press thy finger, pinch thy ear, To admire it overspread Swiftly with pellucid red, Nor shall broad and slender feet Under fruit-laid table meet. Doth not he already know All thy wandering, all thy woe. Come! to weep is now in vain I will lead thee back again. Slight and harmless was the slip That but soil'd the sadden'd lip. Now the place is shown to me Peace and safety shall there be. CLEONE TO ASPASIA. We mind not how the sun in the mid-sky Is hastening on; but when the golden orb Strikes the extreme of earth, and when the gulfs Of air and ocean open to receive him, Dampness and gloom invade us: then we think, Ah! thus is it with Youth. Too fast his feet Run on for sight; hour follows hour; fair maid Succeeds fair maid; bright eyes bestar his couch; The cheerful horn awakens him; the feast, The revel, the entangling dance allure, And voices mellower than the Muse's own Heave up his buoyant bosom on their wave. A little while and then . . Ah, Youth! dear Youth! Listen not to my words . . but stay with me! When thou art gone, Life may go too; the sigh That follows is for thee, and not for Life. THE IAMBICS OF HEPHÆSTION. Speak not too ill of me, Athenian friends! Nor ye, Athenian sages, speak too ill! From others of all tribes am I secure. I leave your confines: none whom you caress, Finding me hungry and athirst, shall dip Into Cephisus the grey bowl to quench My thirst, or break the horny bread, and scoop Stiffly around the scanty vase, wherewith To gather the hard honey at the sides, And give it me for having heard me sing. Sages and friends! a better cause remains For wishing no black sail upon my mast. 'Tis, friends and sages! lest, when other men Say words a little gentler, ye repent, Yet be forbidden by stern pride to share The golden cup of kindness, pushing back Your seats, and gasping for a draught of scorn. Alas! shall this too, never lack'd before, Be, when you most would crave it, out of reach! Thus on the plank, now Neptune is invoked, I warn you of your peril! I must live, And ye, O friends! howe'er unwilling, may. TO PERILLA. Perilla! to thy fates resign'd, Think not what years are gone: While Atalanta lookt behind The golden fruit roll'd on. Albeit a mother may have lost The plaything at her breast, Albeit the one she cherisht most, It but endears the rest. Youth, my Perilla, clings on Hope, And looks into the skies For brighter day; she fears to cope With grief, she shrinks at sighs. Why should the memory of the past Make you and me complain? Come, as we could not hold it fast, We'll play it o'er again. FROM ALCAEUS. Wormwood and rue be on his tongue And ashes on his head, Who chills the feast and checks the song With emblems of the dead! By young and jovial, wise and brave, Such mummers are derided. His sacred rites shall Bacchus have, Unspared and undivided. Coucht by my friends, I fear no mask Impending from above, I only fear the latter flask That holds me from my love. ON AGE. Pleasures! away; they please no more. Friends! are they what they were before? Loves! they are very idle things, The best about them are their wings. The dance! 'tis what the bear can do; Music; I hate your music too. Whene'er these witnesses that Time Hath snatcht the chaplet from our prime, Are call'd by Nature, as we go With eye more wary, step more slow, And will be heard and noted down, However we may fret or frown, Shall we desire to leave the scene Where all our former joys have been? No, 'twere ungrateful and unwise! But when die down our charities For human weal and human woes, This is the time our eyes should close. ODE TO MILETUS. Maiden there was whom Jove Illuded into love, Happy and pure was she; Glorious from her the shore became, And Helle lifted up her name To shine eternal o'er the river-sea. And many tears are shed Upon thy bridal-bed, Star of the swimmer in the lonely night! Who with unbraided hair Wipedst a breast so fair, Bounding with toil, more bounding with delight. But they whose prow hath past thy straits And, ranged before Byzantion's gates, Bring to the God of Sea the victim due. Even from the altar raise their eyes, And drop the chalice with surprise, And at such grandeur have forgotten you. At last there swells the hymn of praise, And who inspires those sacred lays? “The founder of the walls ye see.” What human power could elevate Those walls, that citadel, that gate? “Miletus, O my sons! was he.” Hail then, Miletus! hail, beloved town, Parent of me and mine! But let not power alone be thy renown, Nor chiefs of ancient line, Nor visits of the Gods, unless They leave their thoughts below, And teach us that we most should bless Those to whom most we owe. Restless is Wealth; the nerves of Power Sink, as a lute's in rain; The Gods lend only for an hour And then call back again All else than Wisdom; she alone, In Truth's or Virtue's form, Descending from the starry throne Thro' radiance and thro' storm, Remains as long as godlike men Afford her audience meet, Nor Time nor War tread down again The traces of her feet. Always hast thou, Miletus, been the friend, Protector, guardian, father, of the wise; Therefore shall thy dominion never end Till Fame, despoil'd of voice and pinion, dies. With favouring shouts and flowers thrown fast behind, Arctinos ran his race, No wanderer he, alone and blind . . And Melesander was untorn by Thrace. There have been, but not here, Rich men who swept aside the royal feast On child's or bondman's breast, Bidding the wise and aged disappear. Revere the aged and the wise, Aspasia! but thy sandal is not worn To trample on these things of scorn; By his own sting the fire-bound scorpion dies. ERINNA TO LOVE. Who breathes to thee the holiest prayer, O love! is ever least thy care. Alas! I may not ask thee why 'tis so . . Because a fiery scroll I see Hung at the throne of Destiny, Reason with Love and register with Woe. Few question thee, for thou art strong, And, laughing loud at right and wrong, Seizest, and dashest down, the rich, the poor; Thy sceptre's iron studs alike The meaner and the prouder strike, And wise and simple fear thee and adore. SAPPHO TO HESPERUS. I have beheld thee in the morning hour A solitary star, with thankless eyes, Ungrateful as I am! who bade thee rise When sleep all night had wandered from my bower. Can it be true that thou art he Who shinest now above the sea Amid a thousand, but more bright? Ah yes, the very same art thou That heard me then, and hearest now . . Thou seemest, star of love! to throb with light. TO HESPERUS. Hesperus, hail! thy winking light Best befriends the lover, Whom the sadder Moon for spite Gladly would discover. Thou art fairer far than she, Fairer far and chaster: She may guess who smiled on me, I know who embraced her. Pan of Arcady . . 'twas Pan, In the tamarisk bushes . . Bid her tell thee, if she can, Where were then her blushes. And, were I inclined to tattle, I could name a second, Whom asleep with sleeping cattle To her cave she beckon'd. Hesperus, hail! thy friendly ray Watches o'er the lover, Lest the nodding leaves betray, Lest the Moon discover. Phryne heard my kisses given Acte's rival bosom . . 'Twas the buds, I swore my heaven, Bursting into blossom. What she heard, and half espied By the gleam, she doubted, And with arms uplifted, cried How they must have sprouted! Hesperus, hail again! thy light Best befriends the lover, Whom the sadder Moon for spite Gladly would discover. TO PYRRHA. Pyrrha! your smiles are gleams of sun That after one another run Incessantly, and think it fun. Pyrrha! your tears are short sweet rain That glimmering on the flower-lit plain Zephyrs kiss back to heaven again. Pyrrha! both anguish me: do please To shed but (if you wish me ease) Twenty of those, and two of these. TO MY CHILD CARLINO. Carlino! What art thou about, my boy? Often I ask that question, though in vain, For we are far apart: ah! therefore 'tis I often ask it; not in such a tone As wiser fathers do, who know too well. Were we not children, you and I together? Stole we not glances from each other's eyes? Swore we not secrecy in such misdeeds? Well could we trust each other. Tell me then What thou art doing. Carving out thy name, Or haply mine, upon my favourite seat, With the new knife I sent thee over sea? Or hast thou broken it, and hid the hilt Among the myrtles, starred with flowers, behind? Or under that high throne whence fifty lilies (With sworded tuberoses dense around) Lift up their heads at once, not without fear That they were looking at thee all the while. Does Cincirollo follow thee about? Inverting one swart foot suspensively, And wagging his dread jaw at every chirp Of bird above him on the olive-branch? Frighten him then away! 'twas he who slew Our pigeons, our white pigeons, peacock tailed, That fear'd not you and me . . . alas, nor him! I flattened his stripped sides along my knee, And reasoned with him on his bloody mind, Till he looked blandly, and half closed his eyes To ponder on my lecture in the shade. I doubt his memory much, his heart a little, And in some minor matters (may I say it?) Could wish him rather sager. But from thee God hold back wisdom yet for many years Whether in early season or in late It always comes high priced. For thy pure breast I have no lesson; it for me has many. Come throw it open then! What sports, what cares (Since there are none too young for these) engage Thy busy thoughts? Are you again at work, Walter and you, with those sly labourers, Geppo, Giovanni, Cecco, and Poeta, To build more solidly your broken dam Among the poplars, whence the nightingale Inquisitively watch'd you all day long? I was not of your council in the scheme, Or might have saved you silver without end, And sighs too without number. Art thou gone Below the mulberry, where that cool pool Urged to devise a warmer, and more fit For mighty swimmers, swimming three abreast? Or art thou panting in this summer noon Upon the lowest step before the hall, Drawing a slice of water-melon, long As Cupid's bow, athwart thy wetted lips (Like one who plays Pan's pipe) and letting drop The sable seeds from all their separate cells, And leaving bays profound and rocks abrupt Redder than coral round Calypso's cave. INVOCATION TO SLEEP. Sleep! who contractest the waste realms of Night, None like the wretched can extol thy powers: We think of thee when thou art far away, We hold thee dearer than the light of day, And most when Love forsakes us wish thee ours: Oh hither bend thy flight! Silent and welcome as the blessed shade Alcestis to the dark Thessalian hall, When Hercules and Death and Hell obey'd Her husband's desolate despondent call. What fiend would persecute thee, gentle Sleep, Or beckon thee aside from man's distress? Needless it were to warn thee of the stings That pierce my pillow, now those waxen wings Which bore me to the sun of happiness, Have dropp'd into the deep. Afar behind is gusty March! Again beneath a wider arch The birds, that fear'd grim winter, fly: O'er every pathway trip along Light feet, more light with frolic song, And eyes glance back, they know not why. Say, who is that of leaf so rank, Pushing the violet down the bank With hearted spearhead glossy-green? And why that changeface mural box Points at the myrtle, whom he mocks, Regardless what her cheer hath been? The fennel waves her tender plume; Mezereons cloth'd with thick perfume, And almonds, urge the lagging leaf: Ha! and so long then have I stood And not observ'd thee, modest bud, Wherefrom will rise their lawful chief! Oh never say it, if perchance Thou crown the cup or join the dance, Neither in anger nor in sport; For Pleasure then would pass me by, The Graces look ungraciously, Love frown, and drive me from his court. POET AND LADY. Poet. Thus do you sit and break the flow'rs That might have lived a few short hours, And lived for you! Love, who o'erpowers My youth and me, Shows me the petals idly shed, Shows me my hopes as early dead, In vain, in vain admonishèd By all I see. Lady. And thus you while the noon away, Watching me strip my flowers of gay Apparel, just put on for May, And soon laid by! Cannot you teach me one or two Fine phrases? If you can, pray do, Since you are grown too wise to woo, To listen I. Poet. Lady, I come not here to teach, But learn, the moods of gentle speech; Alas! too far beyond my reach Are happier strains. Many frail leaves shall yet lie pull'd, Many frail hopes in death-bed lull'd, Or ere this outcast heart be school'd By all its pains. FROM THE LAST FRUIT OFF AN OLD TREE. [I strove with none; for none was worth my strife] I strove with none; for none was worth my strife, Nature I loved, and next to Nature, Art; I warmed both hands before the fire of life, It sinks and I am ready to depart. I. ON CATULLUS. Tell me not what too well I know About the bard of Sirmio . . Yes, in Thalia's son Such stains there are . . as when a Grace Sprinkles another's laughing face With nectar, and runs on. II. [There falls with every wedding chime] There falls with every wedding chime A feather from the wing of Time. You pick it up, and say “How fair To look upon its colours are!” Another drops day after day Unheeded; not one word you say. When bright and dusky are blown past, Upon the hearse there nods the last. III. [I entreat you, Alfred Tennyson] I entreat you, Alfred Tennyson, Come and share my haunch of venison. I have too a bin of claret, Good, but better when you share it. Tho' 'tis only a small bin, There 's a stock of it within. And as sure as I'm a rhymer, Half a butt of Rudesheimer. Come; among the sons of men is one Welcomer than Alfred Tennyson? IV. [Fair Love! and fairer Hope! we play'd together] Fair Love! and fairer Hope! we play'd together, When we were little ones, for many a day, Sometimes in fine, sometimes in gloomier weather: Is it not hard to part so soon in May? V. [Love flies with bow unstrung when Time appears] Love flies with bow unstrung when Time appears, And trembles at the assault of heavy years; A few bright feathers bear him on his flight Quite beyond call, but not forgotten quite. VI. [Thou needst not pitch upon my hat] Thou needst not pitch upon my hat, Thou wither'd leaf! to show how near Is now the winter of my year; Alas! I want no hint of that. Prythee, ah prythee get along! Whisper as gently in the ear, I once could whisper in, to fear No change, but live for dance and song. VII. [Stop, stop, friend Cogan! would you throw] Stop, stop, friend Cogan! would you throw That tooth away? You little know Its future: that which now you see A sinner's, an old saint's may be, And popes may bless it in a ring To charm the conscience of some king. VIII. YOUNG. Thou dreariest droll of puffy short-breath'd writers! All thy night-thoughts and day-thoughts hung on mitres. IX. [Here lies our honest friend Sam Parr] Here lies our honest friend Sam Parr, A better man than most men are. So learned, he could well dispense Sometimes with merely common sense: So voluble, so eloquent, You little heeded what he meant: So generous, he could spare a word To throw at Warburton or Hurd: So loving, every village-maid Sought his caresses, tho' afraid. X. [Blythe bell, that calls to bridal halls] Blythe bell, that calls to bridal halls, Tolls deep a darker day; The very shower that feeds the flower Weeps also its decay. XI. TO AN OLD MULBERRY TREE. Old mulberry! with all thy moss around, Thy arms are shatter'd, but thy heart is sound: So then remember one for whom of yore Thy tenderest boughs the crimson berry bore; Remember one who, trusting in thy strength, Lay on the low and level branch full length. No strength has he, alas! to climb it now, Nor strength to bear him, if he had, hast thou. XII. [In port, beyond the swell of winds and tides] In port, beyond the swell of winds and tides, My little skiff the Independence rides. Scanty, tho' strong and hearty is her crew, So, come aboard; she can find room for you. XIII. THE DUKE OF YORK'S STATUE. Enduring is the bust of bronze, And thine, O flower of George's sons, Stands high above all laws and duns. As honest men as ever cart Convey'd to Tyburn took thy part And raised thee up to where thou art. XIV. [Ireland never was contented . .] Ireland never was contented . . Say you so? you are demented. Ireland was contented when All could use the sword and pen, And when Tara rose so high That her turrets split the sky, And about her courts were seen Liveried Angels robed in green, Wearing, by St Patrick's bounty, Emeralds big as half a county. XV. [There is a time when the romance of life] There is a time when the romance of life Should be shut up, and closed with double clasp: Better that this be done before the dust That none can blow away falls into it. XVI. [In summer when the sun's mad horses pass] In summer when the sun's mad horses pass Thro' more than half the heavens, we sink to rest In Italy, nor tread the crackling grass, But wait until they plunge into the west: And could not you, Mazzini! wait awhile? The grass is wither'd, but shall spring again; The Gods, who frown on Italy, will smile As in old times, and men once more be men. XVII. [God scatters beauty as he scatters flowers] God scatters beauty as he scatters flowers O'er the wide earth, and tells us all are ours. A hundred lights in every temple burn, And at each shrine I bend my knee in turn. XVIII. THE DEATH OF MADAME ROLAND. Genius and Virtue! dismal was the dearth Ye saw throughout all France when ye lookt down. In the wide waste of blood-besprinkled earth, There was but one great soul, and that had flown. XIX. [Death stands above me, whispering low] Death stands above me, whispering low I know not what into my ear: Of his strange language all I know Is, there is not a word of fear. XX. ROSE AYLMER'S HAIR, GIVEN BY HER SISTER. Beautiful spoils! borne off from vanquisht death! Upon my heart's high altar shall ye lie, Moved but by only one adorer's breath, Retaining youth, rewarding constancy. XXI. THE ONE GRAVE. Though other friends have died in other days, One grave there is where memory sinks and stays. XXII. [Come forth, old lion, from thy den] Come forth, old lion, from thy den, Come, be the gaze of idle men, Old lion, shake thy mane and growl, Or they will take thee for an owl. XXIII. [Strike with Thor's hammer, strike again] Strike with Thor's hammer, strike again The skulking heads of half-form'd men, And every northern God shall smile Upon thy well-aim'd blow, Carlyle! XXIV. ON SOUTHEY'S BIRTHDAY, NOV. 4. No Angel borne on whiter wing Hath visited the sons of men, Teaching the song they ought to sing And guiding right the unsteady pen. Recorded not on earth alone, O Southey! is thy natal day, But there where stands the choral throne Show us thy light and point the way. XXV. [O wretched despicable slaves] O wretched despicable slaves, Accomplices and dupes of knaves! The cut-throat uncle laid ye low, The cut-purse nephew gags ye now. Behold at last due vengeance come For the brave men ye slew at Rome. XXVI. [There are some tears that only brave men shed] There are some tears that only brave men shed, The rest are common to the human race. The cause of Hungary when Kossuth pled Such tears as his roll'd down the sternest face. Girls wonder'd, by the side of youths who loved, Why they had never wept until that hour; Tender they knew those hearts, but never moved As then. Love own'd there was one greater power. XXVII. [The fault is not mine if I love you too much] The fault is not mine if I love you too much, I loved you too little too long, Such ever your graces, your tenderness such, And the music the heart gave the tongue. A time is now coming when Love must be gone, Tho' he never abandon'd me yet. Acknowledge our friendship, our passion disown, Our follies (ah can you?) forget. XXVIII. TO A CHILD. Pout not, my little Rose, but take With dimpled fingers, cool and soft, This posy, when thou art awake . . Mama has worn my posies oft: This is the first I offer thee, Sweet baby! many more shall rise From trembling hand, from bended knee, Mid hopes and fears, mid doubts and sighs. Before that hour my eyes will close; But grant me, Heaven, this one desire . . In mercy! may my little Rose Never be grafted on a briar. XXIX. [Rest of my heart! no verse can tell] Rest of my heart! no verse can tell My blissful pride, beloved by you; Yet could I love you half so well Unless you once had grieved me too? XXX. [The Wine is murmuring in the gloom] The Wine is murmuring in the gloom, Because he feels that Spring is come To gladden everything outside . . To wing the dove to meet his bride, And not disdainfully to pass Even the snail along the grass; Because he feels that on the slope Of his own hill the vine-flowers ope; Because he feels that never more Will earth or heaven his past restore. He beats against the ribs of iron Which him and all his strength environ; He murmurs, swells, and beats again, But murmurs, swells, and beats in vain. “Why think about it?” Need I say, Remembering one sweet hour last May? We think and feel ('twas your remark) Then most when all around is dark. XXXI. NIL ADMIRARI, ETC. Horace and Creech! Thus do ye teach? What idle speech! Pope! and could you Sanction it too? 'Twill never do. One idle pen Writes it, and ten Write it again. Sages require Much to admire, Nought to desire. God! grant thou me Nature to see Admiringly. Lo! how the wise Read in her eyes Thy mysteries! XXXII. JUNE '51. Versailles! Versailles! thou shalt not keep Her whom this heart yet holds most dear: In her own country she shall sleep; Her epitaph be graven here. XXXIII. TO THE COUNTESS DE MOLANDÈ. I wonder not that Youth remains With you, wherever else she flies: Where could she find such fair domains, Where bask beneath such sunny eyes? XXXIV. YOUTH. The days of our youth are not over while sadness Chills never, and seldom o'ershadows, the heart; While Friendship is crowning the banquet of Gladness And bids us be seated and offers us part; While the swift-spoken when? and the slowly-breath'd hush! Make us half-love the maiden and half-hate the lover, And feel too what is or what should be a blush . . Believe me, the days of our youth are not over. VARIOUS. XXXV. [It was a dream (ah! what is not a dream?)] It was a dream (ah! what is not a dream?) In which I wander'd thro' a boundless space Peopled by those that peopled earth erewhile. But who conducted me? That gentle Power, Gentle as Death, Death's brother. On his brow Some have seen poppies; and perhaps among The many flowers about his wavy curls Poppies there might be; roses I am sure I saw, and dimmer amaranths between. Lightly I thought I lept across a grave Smelling of cool fresh turf, and sweet it smelt. I would, but must not linger; I must on, To tell my dream before forgetfulness Sweeps it away, or breaks or changes it. I was among the Shades (if Shades they were) And lookt around me for some friendly hand To guide me on my way, and tell me all That compast me around. I wisht to find One no less firm or ready than the guide Of Alighieri, trustier far than he, Higher in intellect, more conversant With earth and heaven and whatso lies between. He stood before me . . Southey. “Thou art he,” Said I, “whom I was wishing.” “That I know,” Replied the genial voice and radiant eye. “We may be question'd, question we may not; For that might cause to bubble forth again Some bitter spring which crost the pleasantest And shadiest of our paths.” “I do not ask,” Said I, “about your happiness; I see The same serenity as when we walkt Along the downs of Clifton. Fifty years Have roll'd behind us since that summer-tide, Nor thirty fewer since along the lake Of Lario, to Bellaggio villa-crown'd, Thro' the crisp waves I urged my sideling bark, Amid sweet salutation off the shore From lordly Milan's proudly courteous dames.” “Landor! I well remember it,” said he, “I had just lost my first-born only boy, And then the heart is tender; lightest things Sink into it, and dwell there evermore.” The words were not yet spoken when the air Blew balmier; and around the parent's neck An Angel threw his arms: it was that son. “Father! I felt you wisht me,” said the boy, “Behold me here!” Gentle the sire's embrace, Gentle his tone. “See here your father's friend!” He gazed into my face, then meekly said “He whom my father loves hath his reward On earth; a richer one awaits him here.” XXXVI. LOSS OF MEMORY. Memory! thou hidest from me far, Hidest behind some twinkling star Which peers o'er Pindus, or whose beam Crosses that broad and rapid stream Where Zeus in wily whiteness shone And Leda left her virgin zone. Often I catch thy glimpses still By that clear river, that lone hill, But seldom dost thou softly glide To take thy station at my side, When later friends and forms are near; From these thy traces disappear, And scarce a name can I recall Of those I value most of all. At times thou hurriest me away, And, pointing out an earlier day, Biddest me listen to a song I ought to have forgotten long: Then, looking up, I see above The plumage of departing Love, And when I cry, Art thou too gone? He laughs at me and passes on. Some images (alas how few!) Still sparkle in the evening dew Along my path: and must they quite Vanish before a deeper night? Keep one, O Memory! yet awhile, And let me think I see it smile. XXXVII. TO THE NIGHTINGALE. Gale of the night our fathers call'd thee, bird! Surely not rude were they who call'd thee so, Whether mid spring-tide mirth thy song they heard Or whether its soft gurgle melted woe. They knew not, heeded not, that every clime Hath been attemper'd by thy minstrelsy; They knew not, heeded not, from earliest time How every poet's nest was warm'd by thee. In Paradise's unpolluted bowers Did Milton listen to thy freshest strain; In his own night didst thou assuage the hours When Crime and Tyranny were crown'd again. Melodious Shelley caught thy softest song, And they who heard his music heard not thine Gentle and joyous, delicate and strong, From the far tomb his voice shall silence mine. XXXVIII. ROLAND. When she whose glory casts in shade France and her best and bravest, was convey'd Thither where all worth praise had bled, An aged man in the same car was led To the same end. The only way, Roland! to soothe his fear didst thou essay. “O sir! indeed you must not see The blood that is about to flow from me. Mount first these steps. A mother torn From her one child worse pangs each day hath borne.” He trembled . . but obey'd the word . . Then sprang she up and met the reeking sword. XXXIX. CORDAY. Hearts must not sink at seeing Law lie dead; No, Corday, no; Else Justice had not crown'd in heaven thy head Profaned below. Three women France hath borne, each greater far Than all her men, And greater many were than any are At sword or pen. Corneille, the first among Gaul's rhymer race Whose soul was free, Descends from his high station, proud to trace His line in thee. XL. JANE OF ARC. O Maid of Arc! why dare I not to say Of Orleans? There thro' flames thy glory shone. Accursed, thrice accursed, be the day When English tongues could mock thy parting groan. With Saints and Angels art thou seated now, And with true-hearted patriots, host more rare! To thine is bent in love a Milton's brow, With many a Demon under . . and Voltaire. XLI. ON THE STATUE OF EBENEZER ELLIOTT BY NEVILLE BURNARD, ORDERED BY THE WORKING MEN OF SHEFFIELD. Glory to those who give it! who erect The bronze and marble, not where frothy tongue Or bloody hand points out, no, but where God Ordains the humble to walk forth before The humble, and mount higher than the high. Wisely, O Sheffield, wisely hast thou done To place thy Elliott on the plinth of fame, Wisely hast chosen for that solemn deed One like himself, born where no mother's love Wrapt purple round him, nor rang golden bells, Pendent from Libyan coral, in his ear, To catch a smile or calm a petulance, Nor tickled downy scalp with Belgic lace; But whom strong Genius took from Poverty And said, Rise, mother, and behold thy child! She rose, and Pride rose with her, but was mute. Three Elliotts there have been, three glorious men Each in his generation. One was doom'd By Despotism and Prelaty to pine In the damp dungeon, and to die for Law, Rackt by slow tortures ere he reacht the grave. A second hurl'd his thunderbolt and flame When Gaul and Spaniard moor'd their pinnaces, Screaming defiance at Gibraltar's frown, Until one moment more, and other screams And other writhings rose above the wave, From sails afire and hissing where they fell, And men half burnt along the buoyant mast. A third came calmly on, and askt the rich To give laborious hunger daily bread, As they in childhood had been taught to pray By God's own Son, and sometimes have prayed since. God heard; but they heard not: God sent down bread; They took it, kept it all, and cried for more, Hollowing both hands to catch and clutch the crumbs. I may not live to hear another voice, Elliott, of power to penetrate, as thine, Dense multitudes; another none may see Leading the Muses from unthrifty shades To fields where corn gladdens the heart of Man, And where the trumpet with defiant blast Blows in the face of War, and yields to Peace. Therefore take thou these leaves . . fresh, firm, tho' scant To crown the City that crowns thee her son. She must decay; Toledo hath decayed; Ebro hath half-forgotten what bright arms Flasht on his waters, what high dames adorn'd The baldric, what torn flags o'erhung the aisle, What parting gift the ransom'd knight exchanged. But louder than the anvil rings the lyre; And thine hath raised another city's wall In solid strength to a proud eminence, Which neither conqueror, crushing braver men, Nor time, o'ercoming conqueror, can destroy. So now, ennobled by thy birth, to thee She lifts, with pious love, the thoughtful stone. Genius is tired in search of Gratitude; Here they have met; may neither say farewell! XLII. ODE TO SICILY. I. No mortal hand hath struck the heroick string Since Milton's lay in death across his breast. But shall the lyre then rest Along tired Cupid's wing With vilest dust upon it? This of late Hath been its fate. II. But thou, O Sicily! art born again. Far over chariots and Olympic steeds I see the heads and the stout arms of men, And will record (God give me power!) their deeds. III. Hail to thee first, Palermo! hail to thee Who callest with loud voice, “Arise! be free; Weak is the hand and rusty is the chain.” Thou callest; nor in vain. IV. Not only from the mountain rushes forth The knighthood of the North, In whom my soul elate Owns now a race cognate, But even the couch of Sloth 'mid painted walls Swells up, and men start forth from it, where calls The voice of Honour, long, too long, unheard. V. Not that the wretch was fear'd Who fear'd the meanest as he fear'd the best, (A reed could break his rest) But that around all kings For ever springs A wasting vapour that absorbs the fire Of all that would rise higher. VI. Even free nations will not let there be More nations free. Witness (O shame!) our own Of late years viler none. The second Charles found many and made more Base as himself: his reign is not yet o'er. VII. To gratify a brood Swamp-fed amid the Suabian wood, The sons of Lusitania were cajoled And bound and sold, And sent in chains where we unchain the slave We die with thirst to save. VIII. Ye too, Sicilians, ye too gave we up To drain the bitter cup Ye now dash from ye in the despot's face . . O glorious race, IX. Which Hiero, Gelon, Pindar, sat among And prais'd for weaker deeds in deathless song; One is yet left to laud ye. Years have mar'd My voice, my prelude for some better bard, When such shall rise, and such your deeds create. X. In the lone woods, and late, Murmurs swell loud and louder, till at last So strong the blast That the whole forest, earth, and sea, and sky, To the loud surge reply. XI. Show, in the circle of six hundred years, Show me a Bourbon on whose brow appears No brand of traitor. Prune the tree . . From the same stock for ever will there be The same foul canker, the same bitter fruit. Strike, Sicily, uproot The cursed upas. Never trust That race again; down with it, dust to dust. XLIII. GONFALIONIERI. I. The purest breast that breathes Ausonian air, Utter'd these words. Hear them, all lands! repeat All ages! on thy heart the record bear Till the last tyrant gasp beneath thy feet, Thou who hast seen in quiet death lie down The skulking recreant of the changeling crown. II. “I am an old man now; and yet my soul By fifteen years is younger than its frame: Fifteen I lived (if life it was) in one Dark dungeon, ten feet square: alone I dwelt Six; then another enter'd: by his voice I knew it was a man: I could not see Feature or figure in that dismal place. One year we talkt together of the past, Of joys for ever gone . . ay, worse than gone, Remember'd, prest into our hearts, that swell'd And sorely soften'd under them: the next, We exchanged what thoughts we found: the third, no thought Was left us; memory alone remain'd. The fourth, we askt each other, if indeed The world had life within it, life and joy As when we left it. Now the fifth had come, And we sat silent: all our store was spent. When the sixth enter'd, he had disappear'd, Either for death or doom less merciful: And I repined not! all things were less sad Than that dim vision, that unshapen form. A year or two years after (indistinct Was time, as light was, in that cell) the door Crept open, and these sounds came slowly through: His Majesty the Emperor and King Informs you that twelve months ago your wife Quitted the living . . I did hear the words, All, ere I fell, then heard not bolt nor bar.” III. And shall those live who help with armed hand The weak oppressor? Shall those live who clear The path before him with their golden wand? Tremble, vile slaves! your final hour draws near! Purveyors of a panther's feast are ye, Degenerate children of brave Maccabee! IV. And dare ye claim to sit where Hampden sate, Where Pym and Eliot warn'd the men of blood; Where on the wall Charles read his written fate, And Cromwell sign'd what Milton saw was good? Away, ye panders of assassin lust, Nor ever hope to lick that holy dust. XLIV. TO FRANCIS HARE, BURIED AT PALERMO, ON THE INSURRECTION OF SICILY AND NAPLES. Hare! thou art sleeping where the sun strikes hot On the gold letters that inscribe thy tomb, And what there passeth round thee knowest not, Nor pierce those eyes (so joyous once) the gloom; Else would the brightest vision of thy youth Rise up before thee, not by Fancy led, But moving stately at the side of Truth, Nor higher than the living stand the dead. XLV. TO SAINT CHARLES BORROMEO, ON THE MASSACRE AT MILAN. I Saint, beyond all in glory who surround The throne above! Thy placid brow no thorn blood-dropping crown'd, No grief came o'er thy love, II Save what they suffer'd whom the Plague's dull fire Wasted away, Or those whom Heaven at last let worse Desire Sweep with soft swoop away. III If thou art standing high above the place Where Verban gleams, Where Art and Nature give thee form and space As best beseems, IV Look down on thy fair country, and most fair The sister isles! Whence gratitude eternal mounts with prayer, Where spring eternal smiles; V Watch over that brave youth who bears thy name, And bears it well, Unmindful never of the sacred flame With which his temples swell. VI When praise from thousands breathes beneath thy shrine, And incense steeps Thy calm brow bending over them, for thine Is bent on him who weeps; VII And, O most holy one! what tears are shed Thro' all thy town! Thou wilt with pity on the brave and dead, God will with wrath, look down. XLVI. [Sleep, tho' to Age so needful, shuns my eyes] Sleep, tho' to Age so needful, shuns my eyes, And visions, brighter than Sleep brings, arise. I hear the Norman arms before me ring, I see them flash upon a prostrate king. They conquer'd Britain as they conquer'd France . . Far over Sicily was hurl'd the lance . . The barking heads by Scylla all croucht low, And fierce Charybdis wail'd beneath the blow. Now Sparta-sprung Taranto hail'd again More daring Spartans on this fertile plain; Now Croton saw fresh Milos rise around; And Sybaris, with recent roses crown'd, Yielded to Valour her consenting charms And felt the flush that Beauty feels from arms. XLVII. DANTE. Ere blasts from northern lands Had cover'd Italy with barren sands, Rome's Genius, smitten sore, Wail'd on the Danube, and was heard no more. Twelve centuries had past And crusht Etruria rais'd her head at last. A mightier Power she saw, Poet and prophet, give three worlds the law. When Dante's strength arose Fraud met aghast the boldest of her foes; Religion, sick to death, Lookt doubtful up, and drew in pain her breath. Both to one grave are gone; Altars still smoke, still is the God unknown. Haste, whoso from above Comest with purer fire and larger love, Quenchest the Stygian torch, And leadest from the Garden and the Porch, Where gales breathe fresh and free, And where a Grace is call'd a Charity, To Him, the God of peace, Who bids all discord in his household cease . . Bids it, and bids again, But to the purple-vested speaks in vain. Crying, “Can this be borne?” The consecrated wine-skins creak with scorn; While, leaving tumult there, To quiet idols young and old repair, In places where is light To lighten day . . and dark to darken night. XLVIII. [I told ye, since the prophet Milton's day] I I told ye, since the prophet Milton's day Heroic song hath never swept the earth To soar in flaming chariot up to Heaven. Taunt, little children! taunt ye while ye may. Natural your wonder, natural is your mirth, Natural your weakness. Ye are all forgiven. II One man above all other men is great, Even on this globe, where dust obscures the sign. God closed his eyes to pour into his heart His own pure wisdom. In chill house he sate, Fed only on those fruits the hand divine Disdain'd not, thro' his angels, to impart. III He was despised of those he would have spilt His blood to ransom. How much happier we, Altho' so small and feeble! We are taught There may be national, not royal guilt, And, if there has been, then there ought to be, But 'tis the illusion of a mind distraught. IV This with a tiny hand of ductile lead Shows me the way; this takes me down his slate, Draws me a line and teaches me to write; Another pats me kindly on the head, But finds one letter here and there too great, One passable, one pretty well, one quite. V No wonder I am proud. At such award The Muse most virginal would raise her chin Forth from her collar-bone. What inward fire Must swell the bosom of that favour'd bard And wake to vigorous life the germ within, On whom such judges look with such regard! XLIX. [Few poets beckon to the calmly good] I Few poets beckon to the calmly good, Few lay a hallowing hand upon the head Which lowers its barbarous for our Delphick crown: But loose strings rattle on unseason'd wood And weak words whiffle round where Virtue's meed Shrines in a smile or shrivels in a frown. II He shall not give it, shall not touch it, he Who crawls into the gold-mine, bending low And bringing from its dripples with much mire One shining atom. Could it ever be, O God of light and song? The breast must glow Not with thine only, but with Virtue's fire. L. ON THE SLAUGHTER OF THE BROTHERS BANDIERI, BETRAYED TO THE KING OF NAPLES. Borne on white horses, which the God of Thrace Rein'd not for wanton Glory in the race Of Elis, when from far Ran forth the regal car, Even from Syracuse, across the sea, To roll its thunder thro' that fruitless lea; No; but on steeds whose foam Flew o'er the helm of Rome, Came Castor and his brother; at which sight A shout of victory drown'd the din of fight. O Rome! O Italy! Doom'd are ye, doom'd to see Nor guides divine nor high-aspiring men, Nor proudly tread the battle-field again? Lo! who are they who land Upon that southern strand? Ingenuous are their faces, firm their gait . . Ah! but what darkness follows them? . . 'tis Fate! They turn their heads . . and blood Alone shows where they stood! Sons of Bandiera! heroes! by your name Evoked shall inextinguishable flame Rise, and o'er-run yon coast, And animate the host As did those Twins . . the murderers to pursue Till the same sands their viler blood imbue. LI. TO YOUTH. Where art thou gone, light-ankled Youth? With wing at either shoulder, And smile that never left thy mouth Until the Hours grew colder: Then somewhat seem'd to whisper near That thou and I must part; I doubted it; I felt no fear, No weight upon the heart: If aught befell it, Love was by And roll'd it off again; So, if there ever was a sigh, 'Twas not a sigh of pain. I may not call thee back; but thou Returnest when the hand Of gentle Sleep waves o'er my brow His poppy-crested wand; Then smiling eyes bend over mine, Then lips once prest invite; But sleep hath given a silent sign, And both, alas! take flight. LII. TO AGE. Welcome, old friend! These many years Have we lived door by door: The Fates have laid aside their shears Perhaps for some few more. I was indocil at an age When better boys were taught, But thou at length hast made me sage, If I am sage in aught. Little I know from other men, Too little they from me, But thou hast pointed well the pen That writes these lines to thee. Thanks for expelling Fear and Hope, One vile, the other vain; One's scourge, the other's telescope, I shall not see again: Rather what lies before my feet My notice shall engage . . He who hath braved Youth's dizzy heat Dreads not the frost of Age. LIII. TYRANNICIDE. Danger is not in action, but in sloth; By sloth alone we lose Our strength, our substance, and, far more than both, The guerdon of the Muse. Men kill without compunction hawk and kite; To save the folded flock They chase the wily plunderer of the night O'er thicket, marsh, and rock. Sacred no longer is Our Lord the wolf Nor crown'd is crocodile: And shall ye worship on the Baltick Gulph The refuse of the Nile? Among the myriad men of murder'd sires Is there not one still left Whom wrongs and vengeance urge, whom virtue fires? One conscious how bereft Of all is he . . of country, kindred, home . . He, doom'd to drag along The dray of serfdom, or thro' lands to roam That mock an unknown tongue? A better faith was theirs than pulpits preach Who struck the tyrant down, Who taught the brave how patriot brands can reach And crush the proudest crown. No law for him who stands above the law, Trampling on truth and trust; But hangman's hook or courtier's “privy paw” Shall drag him thro' the dust. Most dear of all the Virtues to her Sire Is Justice; and most dear To Justice is Tyrannicide; the fire That guides her flashes near. See o'er the desert God's red pillar tower! Follow, ye Nations! raise The hymn to God! To God alone be power And majesty and praise! LIV. ON THE APPROACH OF A SISTER'S DEATH. Spirit who risest to eternal day, O hear me in thy flight! Detain thee longer on that opening way I would not if I might. Methinks a thousand come between us two Whom thou wouldst rather hear: Fraternal love thou smilest on; but who Are they that press more near? The sorrowful and innocent and wrong'd, Yes, these are more thy own, For these wilt thou be pleading seraph-tongued (How soon!) before the Throne. LV. ON SWIFT JOINING AVON NEAR RUGBY. Silent and modest Brook! who dippest here Thy foot in Avon as if childish fear Withheld thee for a moment, wend along; Go, follow'd by my song, Sung in such easy numbers as they use Who turn in fondness to the Tuscan Muse And such as often have flow'd down on me From my own Fiesole. I watch thy placid smile, nor need to say That Tasso wove one looser lay, And Milton took it up to dry the tear Dropping on Lycidas's bier. In youth how often at thy side I wander'd! What golden hours, hours numberless, were squander'd Among thy sedges, while sometimes I meditated native rhymes, And sometimes stumbled upon Latian feet; Then, where soft mole-built seat Invited me, I noted down What must full surely win the crown, But first impatiently vain efforts made On broken pencil with a broken blade. Anon, of lighter heart, I threw My hat where circling plover flew, And once I shouted till, instead of plover, There sprang up half a damsel, half a lover. I would not twice be barbarous; on I went . . And two heads sank amid the pillowing bent. Pardon me, gentle Stream, if rhyme Holds up these records in the face of Time: Among the falling leaves some birds yet sing, And Autumn hath his butterflies like Spring. Thou canst not turn thee back, thou canst not see Reflected what hath ceast to be: Haply thou little knowest why I check this levity, and sigh. Thou never knewest her whose radiant morn Lighted my path to Love; she bore thy name, She whom no Grace was tardy to adorn, Whom one low voice pleas'd more than louder fame: She now is past my praises; from her urn To thine, with reverence due, I turn. O silver-braided Swift! no victim ever Was sacrificed to thee, Nor hast thou carried to that sacred River Vases of myrrh, nor hast thou run to see A band of Mænads toss their timbrels high Mid io-evohes to their Deity. But holy ashes have bestrewn thy stream Under the mingled gleam Of swords and torches, and the chaunt of Rome, When Wiclif's lowly tomb Thro' its thick briars was burst By frantic priests accurst; For he had enter'd and laid bare the lies That pave the labyrinth of their mysteries. We part . . but one more look! Silent and modest Brook! LVI. [A voice in sleep hung over me, and said] A voice in sleep hung over me, and said “Seest thou him yonder?” At that voice I raised My eyes: it was an Angel's: but he veil'd His face from me with both his hands, then held One finger forth, and sternly said again, “Seest thou him yonder?” On a grassy slope Slippery with flowers, above a precipice, A slumbering man I saw: methought I knew A visage not unlike it; whence the more It troubled and perplext me. “Can it be My own?” said I. Scarce had the word escaped When there arose two other forms, each fair, And each spake fondest words, and blamed me not, But blest me, for the tears they shed with me Upon that only world where tears are shed, That world which they (why without me?) had left. Another now came forth, with eye askance: That she was of the earth too well I knew, And that she hated those for loving me (Had she not told me) I had soon divined. Of earth was yet another; but more like The heavenly twain in gentleness and love: She from afar brought pity; and her eyes Fill'd with the tears she fear'd must swell from mine: Humanest thoughts with strongest impulses Heav'd her fair bosom; and her hand was raised To shelter me from that sad blight which fell Damp on my heart; it could not; but a blast, Sweeping the southern sky, blew from beyond And threw me on the ice-bergs of the north. LVII. SHAKESPEARE AND MILTON. The tongue of England, that which myriads Have spoken and will speak, were paralyzed Hereafter, but two mighty men stand forth Above the flight of ages, two alone; One crying out, All nations spoke thro' me. The other: True; and thro' this trumpet burst God's word; the fall of Angels, and the doom First of immortal, then of mortal, Man, Glory! be glory! not to me, to God. LVIII. TO MIDSUMMER DAY. Crown of the Year, how bright thou shinest! How little, in thy pride, divinest Inevitable fall! albeit We who stand round about fore-see it. Shine on; shine bravely. There are near Other bright children of the Year, Almost as high, and much like thee In features and in festive glee: Some happy to call forth the mower, And hear his sharpen'd scythe sweep o'er Rank after rank: then others wait Before the grange's open gate, And watch the nodding wane, or watch The fretted domes beneath the thatch, Till young and old at once take wing And promise to return in spring. Yet I am sorry, I must own, Crown of the Year! when thou art gone. LIX. TO SHELLEY. Shelley! whose song so sweet was sweetest here, We knew each other little; now I walk Along the same green path, along the shore Of Lerici, along the sandy plain Trending from Lucca to the Pisan pines Under whose shadow scatter'd camels lie, The old and young, and rarer deer uplift Their knotty branches o'er high-feather'd fern. Regions of happiness! I greet ye well; Your solitudes, and not your cities, stay'd My steps among you; for with you alone Converst I, and with those ye bore of old. He who beholds the skies of Italy Sees ancient Rome reflected, sees beyond, Into more glorious Hellas, nurse of Gods And godlike men: dwarfs people other lands. Frown not, maternal England! thy weak child Kneels at thy feet and owns in shame a lie. LX. WRITTEN AT HURSTMONCEAUX. ON READING A POEM OF WORDSWORTH'S. Derwent! Winander! sweetest of all sounds The British tongue e'er utter'd! lakes that Heaven Reposes on, and finds his image there In all its purity, in all its peace! How are your ripples playing round my heart From such a distance? while I gaze upon The plain where William and where Cæsar led From the same Gaulish strand each conquering host, And one on the Briton, one the Saxon name, Struck out with iron heel. Well may they play, Those ripples, round my heart, buoyed up, entranced. Derwent! Winander! your twin poets come Star-crown'd along with you, nor stand apart. Wordsworth comes hither, hither Southey comes, His friend and mine, and every man's who lives, Or who shall live when days far off have risen. Here are they with me yet again, here dwell Among the sages of Antiquity, Under his hospitable roof whose life Surpasses theirs in strong activity, Whose Genius walks more humbly, stooping down From the same highth to cheer the weak of soul And guide the erring from the tortuous way. Hail ye departed! hail thou later friend, Julius! but never by my voice invoked With such an invocation . . hail, and live! LXI. [Again, perhaps and only once again] Again, perhaps and only once again, I turn my steps to London. Few the scenes And few the friends that there delighted me Will now delight me: some indeed remain, Tho' changed in features . . friend and scene . . both changed! I shall not watch my lilac burst her bud In that wide garden, that pure fount of air, Where, risen ere the morns are warm and bright, And stepping forth in very scant attire, Timidly, as became her in such garb, She hasten'd prompt to call up slumbering Spring. White and dim-purple breathed my favourite pair Under thy terrace, hospitable heart, Whom twenty summers more and more endear'd; Part on the Arno, part where every clime Sent its most graceful sons to kiss thy hand, To make the humble proud, the proud submiss, Wiser the wisest, and the brave more brave. Never, ah never now, shall we alight Where the man-queen was born, or, higher up The nobler region of a nobler soul, Where breathed his last the more than kingly man. Thou sleepest, not forgotten, nor unmourn'd, Beneath the chesnut shade by Saint Germain; Meanwhile I wait the hour of my repose, Not under Italy's serener sky, Where Fiesole beheld me from above Devising how my head most pleasantly Might rest ere long, and how with such intent I smooth'd a platform for my villagers, (Tho' stood against me stubborn stony knoll With cross-grain'd olives long confederate) And brought together slender cypresses And bridal myrtles, peering up between, And bade the modest violet bear her part. Dance, youths and maidens! tho' around my grave Ye dance not, as I wisht: bloom, myrtles! bend Protecting arms about them, cypresses! I must not come among you; fare ye well! EPISTLES. LXII. TO THE AUTHOR OF “FESTUS.” ON THE CLASSICK AND ROMANTICK. Philip! I know thee not, thy song I know: It fell upon my ear among the last Destined to fall upon it; but while strength Is left me, I will rise to hail the morn Of the stout-hearted who begin a work Wherein I did but idle at odd hours. The Faeries never tempted me away From higher fountains and severer shades; Their rings allured me not from deeper track Left by Olympick wheel on ampler plain; Yet could I see them and can see them now With pleasurable warmth, and hold in bonds Of brotherhood men whom their gamesome wreath In youth's fresh slumber caught, and still detains. I wear no cestus; my right hand is free To point the road few seem inclined to take. Admonish thou, with me, the starting youth, Ready to seize all nature at one grasp, To mingle earth, sea, sky, woods, cataracts, And make all nations think and speak alike. Some see but sunshine, others see but gloom, Others confound them strangely, furiously; Most have an eye for colour, few for form. Imperfect is the glory to create, Unless on our creation we can look And see that all is good; we then may rest. In every poem train the leading shoot; Break off the suckers. Thought erases thought, As numerous sheep erase each other's print When spungy moss they press or sterile sand. Blades thickly sown want nutriment and droop, Although the seed be sound, and rich the soil; Thus healthy-born ideas, bedded close, By dreaming fondness perish overlain. A rose or sprig of myrtle in the hair Pleases me better than a far-sought gem. I chide the flounce that checks the nimble feet, Abhor the cruel piercer of the ear, And would strike down the chain that cuts in two The beauteous column of the marble neck. Barbarous and false are all such ornaments, Yet such hath poesy in whim put on. Classical hath been deem'd each Roman name Writ on the roll-call of each pedagogue In the same hand, in the same tone pronounced; Yet might five scanty pages well contain All that the Muses in fresh youth would own Between the grave at Tomos, wet with tears Rolling amain down Getick beard unshorn, And that grand priest whose purple shone afar From his own Venice o'er the Adrian sea. We talk of schools. . unscholarly; if schools Part the romantick from the classical. The classical like the heroick age Is past; but Poetry may reassume That glorious name with Tartar and with Turk, With Goth or Arab, Sheik or Paladin, And not with Roman and with Greek alone. The name is graven on the workmanship. The trumpet-blast of Marmion never shook The God-built walls of Ilion; yet what shout Of the Achaians swells the hearts so high? Nor fainter is the artillery-roar that booms From Hohenlinden to the Baltick strand. Shakespeare with majesty benign call'd up The obedient classicks from their marble seat, And led them thro' dim glen and sheeny glade, And over precipices, over seas Unknown by mariner, to palaces High-archt, to festival, to dance, to joust, And gave them golden spur and vizor barred, And steeds that Pheidias had turn'd pale to see. The mighty man who open'd Paradise, Harmonious far above Homerick song, Or any song that human ears shall hear, Sometimes was classical and sometimes not: Rome chain'd him down; the younger Italy Dissolved (not fatally) his Samson strength. I leave behind me those who stood around The throne of Shakespeare, sturdy, but unclean, To hurry past the opprobrious courts and lanes Of the loose pipers at the Belial feast, Past mimeobscene and grinder of lampoon . . Away the petty wheel, the callous hand! Goldsmith was classical, and Gray almost; So was poor Collins, heart-bound to Romance: Shelley and Keats, those southern stars, shone higher. Cowper had more variety, more strength, Gentlest of bards! still pitied, still beloved! Shrewder in epigram than polity Was Canning; Frere more graceful; Smith more grand; A genuine poet was the last alone. Romantick, classical, the female hand That chain'd the cruel Ivan down for ever, And follow'd up, rapt in his fiery car, The boy of Casabianca to the skies. Other fair forms breathe round us, which exert With Paphian softness Amazonian power, And sweep in bright array the Attick field. To men turn now, who stand or lately stood With more than Royalty's gilt bays adorn'd. Wordsworth, in sonnet, is a classick too, And on that grass-plot sits at Milton's side; In the long walk he soon is out of breath And wheezes heavier than his friends could wish. Follow his pedlar up the devious rill, And, if you faint not, you are well repaid. Large lumps of precious metal lie engulpht In gravely beds, whence you must delve them out And thirst sometimes and hunger; shudder not To wield the pickaxe and to shake the sieve, Well shall the labour be (though hard) repaid. Too weak for ode and epick, and his gait Somewhat too rural for the tragick pall, Which never was cut out of duffel grey, He fell entangled, “on the grunsel-edge Flat on his face, and shamed his worshippers.” Classick in every feature was my friend The genial Southey: none who ruled around Held in such order such a wide domain . . But often too indulgent, too profuse. The ancients see us under them, and grieve That we are parted by a rank morass, Wishing its flowers more delicate and fewer. Abstemious were the Greeks; they never strove To look so fierce: their Muses were sedate, Never obstreperous: you heard no breath Outside the flute; each sound ran clear within. The Fauns might dance, might clap their hands, might shout, Might revel and run riotous; the Nymphs Furtively glanced, and fear'd, or seem'd to fear; Descended on the lightest of light wings, The graceful son of Maia mused apart, Graceful, but strong; he listen'd; he drew nigh; And now with his own lyre and now with voice Temper'd the strain; Apollo calmly smiled. LXIII. TO A FRIEND'S REMONSTRANCE. Preacher of discontent! Then large indeed Would be my audience, copious my display Of common-places. Better curb and quell Not by the bridle but the provender. Sportsmen! manorial lords! of you am I. Let us, since game grows scarcer every day, Watch our preserves near home: we need but beat About the cottage-garden and slim croft For plenteous sport. Catch up the ragged child, Kiss it, however frighten'd: take the hand Of the young girl from out the artizan's Who leads her to the factory, soon to wear The tissue she has woven dyed in shame: Help the halt eld to rule the swerving ass, And upright set his crutch outside the porch, To reach, nor stoop to reach, at his return. 'Tis somewhat to hear blessings, to confer Is somewhat more. Wealth is content to shine By his own light, nor asks he Virtue's aid; But Virtue comes sometimes, and comes unaskt, Nay, comes the first to conference. There is one, One man there is, high in nobility Of birth and fortune, who erects his house Among the heathen, where dun smoke ascends All day around, and drearier fire all night. Far from that house are heard the church's bells, And thro' deep cinders lies the road, yet there Walks the rich man, walks in humility, Because the poor he walks with, and with God. No mitred purple-buskin'd baron he, Self-privileged to strip the calendar Of Sabbath days, to rob the cattle's rest, And mount, mid prance and neighing, his proud throne. Of what is thinking now thy studious head, O artist! in the glorious dome of Art, That thou shouldst turn thine eyes from Titian's ray, Or Raffael's halo round the Virgin's head And Child's, foreshowing Paradise regain'd? Of Ellesmere thou wert thinking; so was I. LXIV. TO THE REVEREND CUTHBERT SOUTHEY. Cuthbert! whose father first in all our land Sate in calm judgment on poetic peer, Whom hatred never, friendship seldom, warpt . . Again I read his page and hear his voice; I heard it ere I knew it, ere I saw Who utter'd it, each then to each unknown. Twelve years had past when upon Avon's cliff, Hard-by his birth-place, first our hands were join'd; After three more he visited my home. Along Lantony's ruin'd aisles we walkt And woods then pathless, over verdant hill And ruddy mountain, and aside the stream Of sparkling Hondy. Just at close of day There by the comet's light we saw the fox Rush from the alders, nor relax in speed Until he trod the pathway of his sires Under the hoary crag of Comioy. Then both were happy. War had paused: the Loire Invited me; again burst forth fierce War. I minded not his fury: there I staid, Sole of my countrymen, and foes abstain'd (Tho' sore and bleeding) from my house alone. But female fear impell'd me past the Alps, Where, loveliest of all lakes, the Lario sleeps Under the walls of Como. There he came Again to see me; there again our walks We recommenced . . less pleasant than before. Grief had swept over him; days darken'd round: Bellagio, Valintelvi, smiled in vain, And Monterosa from Helvetia far Advanced to meet us, mild in majesty Above the glittering crests of giant sons Station'd around . . in vain too! all in vain! Perhaps the hour may come when others, taught By him to read, may read my page aright And find what lies within it; time enough Is there before us in the world of thought. The favour I may need I scorn to ask. What sovran is there able to reprieve, How then to grant, the life of the condemn'd By Justice, where the Muses take their seat? Never was I impatient to receive What any man could give me: when a friend Gave me my due, I took it, and no more . . Serenely glad because that friend was pleas'd. I seek not many, many seek not me, If there are few now seated at my board, I pull no children's hair because they munch Gilt gingerbread, the figured and the sweet, Or wallow in the innocence of whey; Give me wild-boar, the buck's broad haunch give me, And wine that time has mellow'd, even as time Mellows the warrior hermit in his cell. FROM DRY STICKS. I. ON LAW. What thousands, Law, thy handywork deplore! Thou hangest many, but thou starvest more. II. MACAULAY'S PEERAGE. Macaulay is become a peer; A coronet he well may wear; But is there no one to malign? None: then his merit wants the sign. III. PLAYS. How soon, alas, the hours are over, Counted us out to play the lover! And how much narrower is the stage, Allotted us to play the sage! But when we play the fool, how wide The theatre expands; beside, How long the audience sits before us! How many prompters! what a chorus! IV. TO A CYCLAMEN. I come to visit thee again, My little flowerless cyclamen; To touch the hand, almost to press, That cheer'd thee in thy loneliness. What could thy careful guardian find Of thee in form, of me in mind, What is there in us rich or rare, To make us claim a moment's care? Unworthy to be so carest, We are but withering leaves at best. V. TO THE CYCLAMEN. Thou Cyclamen of crumpled horn Toss not thy head aside; Repose it where the Loves were born, In that warm dell abide. Whatever flowers, on mountain, field, Or garden, may arise, Thine only that pure odour yield Which never can suffice. Emblem of her I've loved so long, Go, carry her this little song. VI. HEART'S-EASE. There is a flower I wish to wear, But not until first worn by you . . Heart's-ease . . of all earth's flowers most rare; Bring it; and bring enough for two. VII. HOW TO READ ME. To turn my volumes o'er nor find (Sweet unsuspicious friend!) Some vestige of an erring mind To chide or discommend, Believe that all were loved like you With love from blame exempt, Believe that all my griefs were true And all my joys but dreamt. VIII. APOLOGY FOR GEBIR. Sixty the years since Fidler bore My grouse-bag up the Bala moor; Above the lake, along the lea Where gleams the darkly yellow Dee; Thro' crags, o'er cliffs, I carried there My verses with paternal care, But left them and went home again, To wing the birds upon the plain. With heavier luggage half forgot, For many months they followed not. When over Tawey's sands they came, Brighter flew up my winter flame; And each old cricket sang alert With joy that they had come unhurt. Gebir! men shook their heads in doubt If we were sane: few made us out, Beside one stranger; in his heart We after held no niggard part. The songs of every age he knew, But only sang the pure and true. Poet he was, yet was his smile Without a tinge of gall or guile. Such lived, 'tis said, in ages past; Who knows if Southey was the last? Dapper, who may perhaps have seen My name in some late magazine, Among a dozen or a score Which interest wise people more, Wonders if I can be the same To whom poor Southey augured fame; Erring as usual in his choice Of one who mocks the public voice, And fancies two or three are worth Far more than all the rest on earth. Dapper, in tones benign and clear, Tells those who treasure all they hear, “Landor would have done better far, Had he observed the northern star; Or Bloomfield might have shown the way To one who always goes astray; He might have tried his pen upon The living, not the dead and gone. Are turban'd youths and muffled belles Extinct along the Dardanelles? Is there no scimitar, no axe? Daggers and bow-strings, mutes and sacks? Are they all swept away for ever From that sky-blue resplendent river? Do heroes of old time surpass Cardigan, Somerset, Dundas? Do the Sigæan mounds inclose More corses than Death swept from those?” No, no: but let me ask in turn, Whether, whene'er Corinthian urn, With ivied Faun upon the rim Invites, I may not gaze on him? I love all beauty: I can go At times from Gainsboro' to Watteau; Even after Milton's thorough-bass I bear the rhymes of Hudibras, And find more solid wisdom there Than pads professor's easy chair: But never sit I quiet long Where broidered cassock floats round Young; Whose pungent essences perfume And quirk and quibble trim the tomb; Who thinks the holy bread too plain, And in the chalice pours champagne. I love old places and their climes, Nor quit the syrinx for the chimes. Manners have changed; but hearts are yet The same, and will be while they beat. Ye blame not those who wander o'er Our earth's remotest wildest shore, Nor scoff at seeking what is hid Within one-chambered pyramid; Let me then, with my coat untorn By your acacia's crooked thorn, Follow from Gades to the coast Of Egypt men thro' ages lost. Firm was my step on rocky steeps; Others slipt down loose sandhill heaps. I knew where hidden fountains lay; Hoarse was their thirsty camels' bray; And presently fresh droves had past The beasts expiring on the waste. IX. DEATH OF THE DAY. My pictures blacken in their frames As night comes on, And youthful maids and wrinkled dames Are now all one. Death of the day! a sterner Death Did worse before; The fairest form, the sweetest breath, Away he bore. X. ON SOUTHEY'S DEATH. Friends! hear the words my wandering thoughts would say, And cast them into shape some other day. Southey, my friend of forty years, is gone, And, shattered by the fall, I stand alone. XI. GORE-HOUSE LEFT FOR PARIS. Under the lilacs we shall meet no more, Nor Alfred's welcome hail me at the door, Nor the brave guardian of the hall contend In harsher voice to greet his trusty friend, Nor on the banks of Arno or of Seine Sure is my hope to bend my steps again; But be it surer, Margarite, that Power May still remember many a festive hour, More festive when we saw the captive free, And clasp afresh the hand held forth by thee. XII. THE THREE ROSES. When the buds began to burst, Long ago, with Rose the First I was walking; joyous then Far above all other men, Till before us up there stood Britonferry's oaken wood, Whispering, “Happy as thou art, Happiness and thou must part.” Many summers have gone by Since a Second Rose and I (Rose from that same stem) have told This and other tales of old. She upon her wedding-day Carried home my tenderest lay; From her lap I now have heard Gleeful, chirping, Rose the Third. Not for her this hand of mine Rhyme with nuptial wreath shall twine; Cold and torpid it must lie, Mute the tongue, and closed the eye. XIII. THE LAST GIFT. The shadows deepen round me; take I will not say my last adieu, But, this faint verse; and for my sake Keep the last line I trace for you. The years that lightly touch your head, Nor steal away nor change one hair, Press upon mine with heavy tread And leave but barren laurels there. Another year I may not see, I may not all I hope in this, Receive then on your brow from me And give Rosina's lips the kiss. XIV. LA PENSIEROSA. It is not envy, it is fear Impels me, while I write, to say When Poesy invites, forbear Sometimes to walk her tempting way; Readier is she to swell the tear Than its sharp tinglings to allay. To our first loves we oft return When years, that smooth our path, are past, And wish again the incense-urn Its flickering flame once more to cast On paler brows, until the bourn Is reacht where we may rest at last. Are there no stories fit for song And fit for maiden lips to sing? To you, O Rose, they all belong, About your knee they fondly cling, They love the accents of your tongue, They seek the shadow of your wing. Ah! let the Hours be blythe and free, With Hope for ever at their side, And let the Muses chaunt a glee Of pleasures that await the bride, Of sunny life's untroubled sea, Smooth sands and gently-swelling tide. A time will come when steps are slow And apt on ancient scenes to rest, When life hath lost its former glow And, one by one, your shrinking breast Hath dropt the flowers refreshing so That mansion of the truly blest. Then, nor till then, in spring go forth The graves of waiting friends to see: It would be pleasant to my earth To know your step, if that might be: A bayleaf is above my worth, A daisy is enough for me. XV. THE FIG-TREES OF GHERARDESCA. Ye brave old fig-trees! worthy pair! Beneath whose shade I often lay To breathe awhile a cooler air, And shield me from the darts of day. Strangers have visited the spot, Led thither by my parting song; Alas! the strangers found you not, And curst the poet's lying tongue. Vanisht each venerable head, Nor bough nor leaf could tell them where To look for you, alive or dead; Unheeded was my distant prayer. I might have hoped (if hope had ever Been mine) that storm or time alone Your firm alliance would dissever . . Hath mortal hand your strength o'erthrown? Before an axe had bitten thro' The bleeding bark, some tender thought, If not for me, at least for you, On younger bosoms might have wrought. Age after age your honeyed fruit From boys unseen thro' foliage fell On lifted apron; now is mute The girlish glee! Old friends, farewell! HEROIC IDYLS, WITH ADDITIONAL POEMS. I. A FRIEND TO THEOCRITOS IN EGYPT. Dost thou not often gasp with longdrawn sighs, Theocritos, recalling Sicily? Glorious is Nile, but rather give me back Our little rills which fain would run away And hide themselves from persecuting suns In summer, under oleander boughs, And catch its roses as they flaunt above. Here are no birds that sing, no sweeter flower Than tiny fragile weak-eyed resida, Which faints upon the bosom it would cool. Altho' the royal lotos sits aloof On his rich carpet, spread from wave to wave, I throw myself more gladly where the pine Protects me, loftier than the palace-roof, Or where the linden and acacia meet Across my path, in fragrance to contend. Bring back the hour, Theocritos, when we Shall sit together on a thymy knoll, With few about us, and with none too nigh, And when the song of shepherds and their glee We may repeat, perchance and gaily mock, Until one bolder than the rest springs up And slaps us on the shoulder for our pains. Take thou meanwhile these two papyrus-leaves, Recording, one the loves and one the woes Of Pan and Pitys, heretofore unsung. Aside our rivers and within our groves The pastoral pipe hath dropt its mellow lay, And shepherds in their contests only try Who best can puzzle. Come, Theocritos, Come, let us lend a shoulder to the wheel And help to lift it from this depth of sand. II. PAN. Pan led me to a wood the other day, Then, bending both hoofs under him, where moss Was softest and where highest was the tuft, Said he, “Sit thou aside me; there is room Just for us two; the tinklers are below To catch the little birds and butterflies, Nor see us nor would heed us if they saw. I minded thee in Sicily with one I dearly love; I heard thee tell my loss Of Pitys; and he swore that none but thou Could thus contend with him, or ever should. Though others had loud lyres and struck them well, Few could bring any harmony from reeds By me held high, and higher since thou hast breath'd Thy gentle breath o'er Pitys and her Pan.” III. MEMORY. The mother of the Muses, we are taught, Is Memory: she has left me; they remain, And shake my shoulder, urging me to sing About the summer days, my loves of old. Alas! alas! is all I can reply. Memory has left with me that name alone, Harmonious name, which other bards may sing, But her bright image in my darkest hour Comes back, in vain comes back, call'd or uncall'd. Forgotten are the names of visitors Ready to press my hand but yesterday; Forgotten are the names of earlier friends Whose genial converse and glad countenance Are fresh as ever to mine ear and eye; To these, when I have written, and besought Remembrance of me, the word Dear alone Hangs on the upper verge, and waits in vain. A blessing wert thou, O oblivion. IV. TO THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH. Pleas'd was I when you told me how In hat that buffeted the brow And mason's loose habiliment With masons thro' Ham's gate you went. Heartily glad was I to see A prisoner, though a prince, set free. “Prince!” said I, “you've escaped two worst Of evils.” “I have known a first,” Said you, “but that is only one, Tell me the other.” “'Tis a throne.” I could not add what now I might, It keeps the worthy out of sight, Nor lets the sitter sit upright. Can there be pleasure to keep down In rusty chains a struggling town? Can there be any to hear boom Your cannon o'er the walls of Rome? Or shows it strength to break a word As easily as girls a cord Of flimsy cotton, when the bell Calls them to dinner? . . to rebel Against rebellion in your eyes Is criminal, to crouch is wise. Louis! your father thought not so; His sceptre he disdain'd to owe To falsehood; all his cares he bent To make the realm he ruled content. He proved, what many people doubt As often as they look about, A wonderful unheard of thing . . An honest man may be a king. V. [Lyndhurst came up to me among] Lyndhurst came up to me among A titled and untitled throng, And after a few words were said About the living and the dead, Whom we had known together more Than half a century before, He added: “Faith! your choice was best Amid the woods to build a nest. But why so seldom wing it down, To look at us who toil in town?” “Would you change place with me?” said I. To this a laugh was a reply. VI. ABERTAWY. It was no dull tho' lonely strand Where thyme ran o'er the solid sand, Where snap-dragons with yellow eyes Lookt down on crowds that could not rise, Where Spring had fill'd with dew the moss In winding dells two strides across. There tiniest thorniest roses grew To their full size, nor shared the dew: Acute and jealous, they took care That none their softer seat should share; A weary maid was not to stay Without one for such churls as they. I tugg'd and lugg'd with all my might To tear them from their roots outright; At last I did it . . eight or ten . . We both were snugly seated then; But then she saw a half-round bead, And cried, Good gracious! how you bleed! Gently she wiped it off, and bound With timorous touch that dreadful wound. To lift it from its nurse's knee I fear'd, and quite as much fear'd she, For might it not increase the pain, And make the wound burst out again? She coaxt it to lie quiet there With a low tune I bent to hear; How close I bent I quite forget, I only know I hear it yet. Where is she now? Call'd far away, By one she dared not disobey, To those proud halls, for youth unfit, Where princes stand and judges sit. Where Ganges rolls his widest wave She dropt her blossom in the grave; Her noble name she never changed, Nor was her nobler heart estranged. VII. [Ye who have toil'd uphill to reach the haunt] Ye who have toil'd uphill to reach the haunt Of other men who lived in other days, Whether the ruins of a citadel Raised on the summit by Pelasgic hands, Or chamber of the distaff and the song . . Ye will not tell what treasure there ye found, But I will. Ye found there the viper laid Full-length, flat-headed, on a sunny slab, Nor loth to hiss at ye while crawling down. Ye saw the owl flap the loose ivy-leaves And, hooting, shake the berries on your heads. Now, was it worth your while to mount so high Merely to say you did it, and to ask If those about you ever did the like? Believe me, O my friends, 'twere better far To stretch your limbs along the level sand As they do, where small children scoop the drift, Thinking it must be gold, where curlews soar And scales drop glistening from the prey above. VIII. [“Call me not forth,” said one who sate retired] “Call me not forth,” said one who sate retired, Whom Love had once, but Envy never, fired. “I scorn the crowd: no clap of hands he seeks Who walks among the stateliest of the Greeks.” IX. A FOREIGN RULER. He says, My reign is peace, so slays A thousand in the dead of night. Are you all happy now? he says, And those he leaves behind cry quite. He swears he will have no contention, And sets all nations by the ears; He shouts aloud, No intervention! Invades, and drowns them all in tears. X. [To my ninth decad I have totter'd on] To my ninth decad I have totter'd on, And no soft arm bends now my steps to steady; She, who once led me where she would, is gone, So when he calls me, Death shall find me ready. XI. [They are sweet flowers that only blow by night] They are sweet flowers that only blow by night, And sweet tears are there that avoid the light; No mortal sees them after day is born, They, like the dew, drop trembling from their thorn. XII. [Well I remember how you smiled] Well I remember how you smiled To see me write your name upon The soft sea-sand. . “O! what a child! You think you're writing upon stone!” I have since written what no tide Shall ever wash away, what men Unborn shall read o'er ocean wide And find Ianthe's name again. XIII. ['Twas far beyond the midnight hour] 'Twas far beyond the midnight hour And more than half the stars were falling, And jovial friends, who lost the power Of sitting, under chairs lay sprawling; Not Porson so; his stronger pate Could carry more of wine and Greek Than Cambridge held; erect he sate; He nodded, yet could somehow speak. “'Tis well, O Bacchus! they are gone, Unworthy to approach thy altar! The pious man prays best alone, Nor shall thy servant ever falter.” Then Bacchus too, like Porson, nodded, Shaking the ivy on his brow, And graciously replied the godhead, “I have no votary staunch as thou.” XIV. [Shelley and Keats, on earth unknown] Shelley and Keats, on earth unknown One to the other, now are gone Where only such pure Spirits meet And sing before them words as sweet. XV. [Lately our songsters loiter'd in green lanes] Lately our songsters loiter'd in green lanes, Content to catch the ballads of the plains; I fancied I had strength enough to climb A loftier station at no distant time, And might securely from intrusion doze Upon the flowers thro' which Ilissus flows. In those pale olive grounds all voices cease, And from afar dust fills the paths of Greece. My slumber broken and my doublet torn, I find the laurel also bears a thorn. XVI. [Never must my bones be laid] Never must my bones be laid Under the mimosa's shade. He to whom I gave my all Swept away her guardian wall, And her green and level plot Green or level now is not. XVII. TO SIR RODERICK MURCHISON. What see I through the mist of years? a friend, If the most ignorant of mortal men In every science, may pronounce his name Whom every science raises above all. Murchison! thou art he. Upon the bank Of Loire thou camest to me, brought by Hare The witty and warm-hearted, passing through That shady garden whose broad tower ascends From chamber over chamber; there I dwelt, The flowers my guests, the birds my pensioners, Books my companions, and but few beside. After two years the world's devastator Was driven forth, yet only to return And stamp again upon a fallen race. Back to old England flew my countrymen; Even brave Bentham, whose inventive skill Baffled at Chesmè and submerged the fleet Of Ottoman, urged me to flight with him Ere the infuriate enemy arrived. I wrote to Carnot, I am here at Tours, And will remain. He praised my confidence In the French honour; it was placed in his. No house but mine was left unoccupied In the whole city by the routed troops. Ere winter came 'twas time to cross the Alps; Como invited me; nor long ere came Southey, a sorrowing guest, who lately lost His only boy. We walkt aside the lake, And mounted to the level downs above, Where if we thought of Skiddaw, named it not. I led him to Bellaggio, of earth's gems The brightest. We in England have as bright, Said he, and turned his face toward the west. I fancied in his eyes there was a tear, I know there was in mine: we both stood still. Gone is he now to join the son in bliss, Innocent each alike, one longest spared To show that all men have not lived in vain. Gone too is Hare: afar from us he lies, In sad Palermo, where the most accurst Cover his bones with bones of free men slain. Again I turn to thee, O Murchison! Why hast thou lookt so deep into the earth To find her treasures? Gold we thought had done Its worst before: now fields are left untill'd, And cheerful songs speed not the tardy woof. How dare I blame thee? 'twas not thy offence, And good from evil springs, as day from night! The covetous and vicious delve the mine And sieve the dross that industry may work For nobler uses: soon shall crops arise More plenteous from it, soon the poor shall dwell In their own houses, and their children throw Unstinted fuel on the Christmas blaze With shouts that shake the holly-branch above. FROM THE HELLENICS. [Come back, ye wandering Muses, come back home] Come back, ye wandering Muses, come back home, Ye seem to have forgotten where it lies: Come, let us walk upon the silent sands Of Simois, where deep foot-marks show long strides; Thence we may mount, perhaps, to higher ground, Where Aphroditè from Athenè won The golden apple, and from Herè too, And happy Ares shouted far below. Or would ye rather choose the grassy vale Where flow Anapos thro' anemones, Hyacinths, and narcissuses, that bend To show their rival beauty in the stream? Bring with you each her lyre, and each in turn Temper a graver with a lighter song. THRASYMEDES AND EUNÖE. Who will away to Athens with me? who Loves choral songs and maidens crown'd with flowers, Unenvious? mount the pinnace; hoist the sail. I promise ye, as many as are here, Ye shall not, while ye tarry with me, taste From unrinsed barrel the diluted wine Of a low vineyard or a plant ill-pruned, But such as anciently the Ægean isles Pour'd in libation at their solemn feasts: And the same goblets shall ye grasp, embost With no vile figures of loose languid boors, But such as Gods have lived with and have led. The sea smiles bright before us. What white sail Plays yonder? what pursues it? Like two hawks Away they fly. Let us away in time To overtake them. Are they menaces We hear? And shall the strong repulse the weak, Enraged at her defender? Hippias! Art thou the man? 'Twas Hippias. He had found His sister borne from the Cecropian port By Thrasymedes. And reluctantly? Ask, ask the maiden; I have no reply. “Brother! O brother Hippias! O, if love, If pity, ever toucht thy breast, forbear! Strike not the brave, the gentle, the beloved, My Thrasymedes, with his cloak alone Protecting his own head and mine from harm.” “Didst thou not once before,” cried Hippias, Regardless of his sister, hoarse with wrath At Thrasymedes, “didst not thou, dog-eyed, Dare, as she walkt up to the Parthenon, On the most holy of all holy days, In sight of all the city, dare to kiss Her maiden cheek?” “Ay, before all the Gods, Ay, before Pallas, before Artemis, Ay, before Aphrodite, before Heré, I dared; and dare again. Arise, my spouse! Arise! and let my lips quaff purity From thy fair open brow.” The sword was up, And yet he kist her twice. Some God withheld The arm of Hippias; his proud blood seeth'd slower And smote his breast less angrily; he laid His hand on the white shoulder, and spake thus: “Ye must return with me. A second time Offended, will our sire Pisistratos Pardon the affront? Thou shouldst have askt thyself This question ere the sail first flapt the mast.” “Already thou hast taken life from me; Put up thy sword,” said the sad youth, his eyes Sparkling; but whether love or rage or grief They sparkled with, the Gods alone could see. Piræeus they re-entered, and their ship Drove up the little waves against the quay, Whence was thrown out a rope from one above, And Hippias caught it. From the virgin's waist Her lover dropt his arm, and blusht to think He had retain'd it there in sight of rude Irreverent men: he led her forth, nor spake. Hippias walkt silent too, until they reacht The mansion of Pisistratos her sire. Serenely in his sternness did the prince Look on them both awhile: they saw not him, For both had cast their eyes upon the ground “Are these the pirates thou hast taken, son?” Said he. “Worse, father! worse than pirates they, Who thus abuse thy patience, thus abuse Thy pardon, thus abuse the holy rites Twice over.” “Well hast thou performed thy duty,” Firmly and gravely said Pisistratos. “Nothing then, rash young man! could turn thy heart From Eunöe, my daughter?” “Nothing, sir, Shall ever turn it. I can die but once And love but once. O Eunöe! farewell!” “Nay, she shall see what thou canst bear for her.” “O father! shut me in my chamber, shut me In my poor mother's tomb, dead or alive, But never let me see what he can bear; I know how much that is, when borne for me.” “Not yet: come on. And lag not thou behind, Pirate of virgin and of princely hearts! Before the people and before the Goddess Thou hadst evinced the madness of thy passion, And now wouldst bear from home and plenteousness To poverty and exile this my child.” Then shuddered Thrasymedes, and exclaim'd, “I see my crime; I saw it not before. The daughter of Pisistratos was born Neither for exile nor for poverty, Ah! nor for me!” He would have wept, but one Might see him, and weep worse. The prince unmoved Strode on, and said, “To-morrow shall the people, All who beheld thy trespasses, behold The justice of Pisistratos, the love He bears his daughter, and the reverence In which he holds the highest law of God.” He spake; and on the morrow they were one. ICARIOS AND ERIGONÈ. Improvident were once the Attic youths, As (if we may believe the credulous And testy) various youths have been elsewhere. But truly such was their improvidence, Ere Pallas in compassion was their guide, They never stowed away the fruits of earth For winter use; nor knew they how to press Olive or grape: yet hospitality Sate at the hearth, and there was mirth and song. Wealthy and generous in the Attic land, Icarios! wert thou; and Erigonè, Thy daughter, gave with hearty glee the milk, Buzzing in froth beneath unsteady goat, To many who stopt near her; some for thirst, And some to see upon its back that hand So white and small and taper, and await Until she should arise and show her face. The father wisht her not to leave his house, Nor she to leave her father; yet there sued From all the country round both brave and rich; Some, nor the wealthier of her wooers, drove Full fifty slant-brow'd kingly-hearted swine, Reluctant ever to be led aright, Race autocratical, autochthon race, Lords of the woods, fed by the tree of Jove. Some had three ploughs; some had eight oxen; some Had vines, on oak, on maple, and on elm, In long and strait and gleamy avenues, Which would have tired you had you reacht the end Without the unshapen steps that led beyond Up the steep hill to where they lean'd on poles. Yet kind the father was, and kind the maid. And now when winter blew the chaff about, And hens pursued the grain into the house, Quarrelsome and indignant at repulse, And rushing back again with ruffled neck, They and their brood; and kids blinkt at the brand, And bee-nosed oxen, with damp nostrils lowered Against the threshold, stampt the dogs away; Icarios, viewing these with thoughtful mind, Said to Erigonè, “Not scantily The Gods have given us these birds, and these Short-bleating kids, and these loose-hided steers. The Gods have given: to them will we devote A portion of their benefits, and bid The youths who love and honour us partake: So shall their hearts, and so shall ours, rejoice.” The youths were bidden to the feast: the flesh Of kid and crested bird was plentiful: The steam hung on the rafters, where were nail'd Bushes of savory herbs, and figs and dates; And yellow-pointed pears sent down long stalks Through nets wide-mesht, work of Erigonè When night was long and lamp yet unsupplied. Choice grapes Icarios had; and these, alone Of all men in the country, he preserved For festive days; nor better day than this To bring them from beneath his reed-thatcht roof. He mounted the twelve stairs with hearty pride, And soon was heard he, breathing hard: he now Descended, holding in both arms a cask, Fictile, capacious, bulging: cork-tree bark Secured the treasure; wax above the mouth, And pitch above the wax. The pitch he brake, The wax he scraped away, and laid them by, Wrenching up carefully the cork-tree bark. A hum was heard. “What! are there bees within?” Euphorbas cried. “They came then with the grapes,” Replied the elder, and pour'd out clear juice Fragrant as flowers, and wrinkled husks anon. “The ghosts of grapes?” cried Phanor, fond of jokes Within the house, but ever abstinent Of such as that in woodland and alone, Where any sylvan God might overhear. No few were saddened at the ill-omen'd word, But sniffing the sweet odour, bent their heads, Tasted, sipt, drank, ingurgitated: fear Flew from them all, joy rusht to every breast, Friendship grew warmer, hands were join'd, vows sworn. From cups of every size, from cups two-ear'd, From ivy-twisted and from smooth alike, They dash the water; they pour in the wine; (For wine it was) until that hour unseen. They emptied the whole cask; and they alone; For both the father and the daughter sate Enjoying their delight. But when they saw Flusht faces, and when angry words arose As one more fondly glanced against the cheek Of the fair maiden on her seat apart, And she lookt down, or lookt another way Where other eyes caught hers and did the like, Sadly the sire, the daughter fearfully, Upon each other fixt wide-open eyes. This did the men remark, and, bearing signs Different, as were their tempers, of the wine, But feeling each the floor reel under him, Each raging with more thirst at every draught, Acastor first (sidelong his step) arose, Then Phanor, then Antyllos: “Zeus above Confound thee, cursed wretch!” aloud they cried, “Is this thy hospitality? must all Who loved thy daughter perish at a blow? Not at a blow, but like the flies and wasps.” Madness had seiz'd them all. Erigonè Ran out for help; what help? Before her sprang Mœra, and howl'd and barkt, and then return'd Presaging. They had dragg'd the old man out And murdered him. Again flew Mœra forth, Faithful, compassionate, and seiz'd her vest, And drew her where the body lay, unclosed The eyes, and rais'd toward the stars of heaven. Thou who hast listened, and still ponderest, Raise thine, for thou hast heard enough, raise thine And view Böotes bright among those stars, Brighter the Virgin: Mœra too shines there. But where were the Eumenides? Repress Thy anger. If the clear calm stars above Appease it not, and blood must flow for blood, Harken, and hear the sequel of the tale. Wide-seeing Zeus lookt down; as mortals knew By the woods bending under his dark eye, And huge towers shuddering on the mountain-tops, And stillness in the valley, in the wold, And over the deep waters all round earth. He lifted up his arm, but struck them not In their abasement: by each other's blow They fell; some suddenly; but more beneath The desperate gasp of long-enduring wounds. THE CHILDREN OF VENUS. Twain are the sons of Venus: one beholds Our globe in gladness, while his brother's eye Casts graver glances down, nor cares for woods Or song, unworthy of the name of Love. Nothing is sweet to him, as pure and cold As rain and Eurus. What dissension thus Severed the beauteous pair? Ambition did. With heavy heart the elder bore that he Whom often with an arrow in his hand He saw, and whetstone under it, and knew To spend the day entire in weaving flowers Or drawing nets, as might be, over birds, That he should have men's incense, he have shrines, While only empty honour, silent prayer, Was offered to himself. On this he goes And makes Silenus arbiter. The eld With gentle speech would fain assuage his wrath; It rises but the higher: he bids him call The Idalian to his presence, then decide. With downcast eye, and drooping wing, and cheek Suffused with shame, the little one advanced, And “Brother! did you call me? Then at last The poor Idalian is not quite despised?” The kindly arbiter in vain attempts To bring together two such potent hands. “No,” said the taller; “I am here for this, This only, that he learn, and by defeat, What is my power.” Hereon Silenus, “Go! Kiss first: then both (but with no enemy) In power and honour safely may contend.” The younger leaps upon the elder's neck And kisses it and kisses it again: The austerer could not, tho' he would, resist Those rapid lips; one kiss he did return, Whether the influence of the God prevail'd, Or whether 'tis impossible to stand Repelling constantly a kindly heart. But neither his proud words did he remit Nor resolution: he began to boast How with his radiant fire he had reduced The ancient Chaos; how from heaven he drove The darkness that surrounded it, and drew Into their places the reluctant stars, And made some stand before him, others go Beyond illimitable space; then curb'd The raging sea and chain'd with rocks around. “Is not all this enough for you?” exclaimed The brother; “must my little realm be stript Of every glory? You will make me proud In speech, refusing what is justly due. Upon my birth the golden ether smiled. What Chaos was I know not, I confess; I would let every star fly where it list, Nor try to turn it: her who rules them all I drew behind the Latmian cliffs; she prayed, She promist ever to perform my will Would I but once be friendly. 'Twas her first, 'Twas her last vow . . and it was made to me. Now you alike inhabit the same heaven, And she must know you, yet none other Love Acknowledges save him whom you despise. To me what matter are the raging seas, Curb'd or uncurb'd, in chains or out of chains? I penetrate the uttermost retreat Of Nereus; I command, and from the deep Dolphins rise up and give their pliant backs For harps to grate against and songmen ride; And, when I will'd it, they have fondly wept For human creatures human tears, and laid Their weary lives down on the dry sea-sand. Desert thou some one, and he knows it not; Let me desert him, let me but recede One footstep, and funereal fire consumes His inmost heart. “The latest guest above With basket overturn'd and broken thread Lay lithe as new-mown grass before the gate Of Omphale: a fondled whelp tug'd off The lion-skin, and left athwart his breast. Vast things and wonderful are those you boast. I would say nothing of the higher Powers, Lest it might chafe you. How the world turns round I know not, or who tempers the extremes Of heat and cold and regulates the tides. I leave them all to you: give me instead Dances and crowns and garlands; give the lyre, And softer music of the river-side Where the stream laps the sallow-leaves, and breaks The quiet converse of the whispering reeds: Give me, for I delight in them, the clefts Of bank o'ergrown by moss's soft deceit. I wish but to be happy: others say That I am powerful: whether so or not Let facts bear witness: in the sun, the shade, Beneath the setting and the rising stars Let these speak out; I keep them not in mind.” “Scarce less thy promises,” the other cried. He smiled and own'd it. “You will soon educe Bolder assertion of important deeds Who things terrestial haughtily despise. Decline your presence at the blissful couch, And boast you never make those promises Which make so many happy, but with eye Averted from them gaze into the deep, Yet tell me, tell me, solemn one, that swearest By that dark river only, who compel'd Pluto to burn amid the deepest shades, Amid the windings of the Stygian stream And panting Phlegethon? while barkt the dog Three-throated, so that all his realm resounds. And who (here lies the potency) who made The griesly Pluto please the captive bride? Mere sport! If graver, better, things you want, This is the hand, and this the torch it held (You might have heard each drop the Danäid Let fall, Ixion's wheel you might have heard Creak, as now first without his groans it roll'd) When the fond husband claspt Eurydice, And the fond wife the earliest slain at Troy.” The arbiter embraced him: more composed He turn'd toward the other and pronounced This sentence. “O most worthy of thy sire The Thunderer! to thy guidance I commit The stars (if he approve of it) and storms And seas, and rocks coercing their uproar, If Amphitrite smile, if Neptune bend. But, O thou smaller one of lighter wing, Source of the genial laugh and dulcet smile, Who makest every sun shed softer rays, And one sole night outvalue all that shine, Who holdest back (what Jove could never do) The flying Hours! thou askest nought beyond; And this do I award thee. I bestow On thee alone the gentle hand hand-linkt . . Thy truest bond . . on thee the flowers, the lyre, The river's whispers which the reeds increase, The spring to weave thy trophies, the whole year To warm and fill it with the balm of spring. Only do thou” . . he whispered in the ear Of Love, and blusht in whispering it . . “incline Ianthe . . touch her gently . . just the point . . Nor let that other know where thou hast aim'd.” THE HAMADRYAD. Rhaicos was born amid the hills wherefrom Gnidos the light of Caria is discern'd, And small are the white-crested that play near, And smaller onward are the purple waves. Thence festal choirs were visible, all crown'd With rose and myrtle if they were inborn; If from Pandion sprang they, on the coast Where stern Athenè raised her citadel, Then olive was intwined with violets Cluster'd in bosses, regular and large. For various men wore various coronals; But one was their devotion: 'twas to her Whose laws all follow, her whose smile withdraws The sword from Ares, thunderbolt from Zeus, And whom in his chill caves the mutable Of mind, Poseidon, the sea-king, reveres, And whom his brother, stubborn Dis, hath pray'd To turn in pity the averted cheek Of her he bore away, with promises, Nay, with loud oath before dread Styx itself, To give her daily more and sweeter flowers Than he made drop from her on Enna's dell. Rhaicos was looking from his father's door At the long trains that hastened to the town From all the valleys, like bright rivulets Gurgling with gladness, wave outrunning wave, And thought it hard he might not also go And offer up one prayer, and press one hand, He knew not whose. The father call'd him in, And said, “Son Rhaicos! those are idle games; Long enough I have lived to find them so.” And ere he ended, sighed; as old men do Always, to think how idle such games are. “I have not yet,” thought Rhaicos in his heart, And wanted proof. “Suppose thou go and help Echeion at the hill, to bark yon oak And lop its branches off, before we delve About the trunk and ply the root with axe: This we may do in winter.” Rhaicos went; For thence he could see farther, and see more Of those who hurried to the city-gate. Echeion he found there, with naked arm Swart-hair'd, strong-sinew'd, and his eyes intent Upon the place where first the axe should fall: He held it upright. “There are bees about, Or wasps, or hornets,” said the cautious eld, “Look sharp, O son of Thallinos!” The youth Inclined his ear, afar, and warily, And cavern'd in his hand. He heard a buzz At first, and then the sound grew soft and clear, And then divided into what seem'd tune, And there were words upon it, plaintive words. He turn'd, and said, “Echeion! do not strike That tree: it must be hollow; for some God Speaks from within. Come thyself near.” Again Both turn'd toward it: and behold! there sat Upon the moss below, with her two palms Pressing it on each side, a maid in form. Downcast were her long eyelashes, and pale Her cheek, but never mountain-ash display'd Berries of colour like her lips so pure, Nor were the anemones about her hair Soft, smooth, and wavering, like the face beneath. “What dost thou here?” Echeion, half-afraid, Half-angry, cried. She lifted up her eyes, But nothing spake she. Rhaicos drew one step Backward, for fear came likewise over him, But not such fear: he panted, gaspt, drew in His breath, and would have turn'd it into words, But could not into one. “O send away That sad old man!” said she. The old man went Without a warning from his master's son, Glad to escape, for sorely he now fear'd, And the axe shone behind him in their eyes. Hamadryad. And wouldst thou too shed the most innocent Of blood? no vow demands it; no God wills The oak to bleed. Rhaicos. Who art thou? whence? why here? And whither wouldst thou go? Among the robed In white or saffron, or the hue that most Resembles dawn or the clear sky, is none Array'd as thou art. What so beautiful As that gray robe which clings about thee close, Like moss to stones adhering, leaves to trees, Yet lets thy bosom rise and fall in turn, As, toucht by zephyrs, fall and rise the boughs Of graceful platane by the river-side. Hamadryad. Lovest thou well thy father's house? Rhaicos. Indeed I love it, well I love it, yet would leave For thine, where'er it be, my father's house, With all the marks upon the door, that show My growth at every birth-day since the third, And all the charms, o'erpowering evil eyes, My mother nail'd for me against my bed, And the Cydonian bow (which thou shalt see) Won in my race last spring from Eutychos. Hamadryad. Bethink thee what it is to leave a home Thou never yet hast left, one night, one day. Rhaicos. No, 'tis not hard to leave it; 'tis not hard To leave, O maiden, that paternal home, If there be one on earth whom we may love First, last, for ever; one who says that she Will love for ever too. To say which word, Only to say it, surely is enough . . It shows such kindness . . if 'twere possible We at the moment think she would indeed. Hamadryad. Who taught thee all this folly at thy age? Rhaicos. I have seen lovers and have learnt to love. Hamadryad. But wilt thou spare the tree? Rhaicos. My father wants The bark; the tree may hold its place awhile. Hamadryad. Awhile! thy father numbers then my days? Rhaicos. Are there no others where the moss beneath Is quite as tufty? Who would send thee forth Or ask thee why thou tarriest? Is thy flock Anywhere near? Hamadryad. I have no flock: I kill Nothing that breathes, that stirs, that feels the air, The sun, the dew. Why should the beautiful (And thou art beautiful) disturb the source Whence springs all beauty? Hast thou never heard Of Hamadryads? Rhaicos. Heard of them I have: Tell me some tale about them. May I sit Beside thy feet? Art thou not tired? The herbs Are very soft; I will not come too nigh; Do but sit there, nor tremble so, nor doubt. Stay, stay an instant: let me first explore If any acorn of last year be left Within it; thy thin robe too ill protects Thy dainty limbs against the harm one small Acorn may do. Here's none. Another day Trust me; till then let me sit opposite. Hamadryad. I seat me; be thou seated, and content. Rhaicos. O sight for gods! Ye men below! adore The Aphroditè. Is she there below? Or sits she here before me? as she sate Before the shepherd on those highths that shade The Hellespont, and brought his kindred woe. Hamadryad. Reverence the higher Powers; nor deem amiss Of her who pleads to thee, and would repay . . Ask not how much . . but very much. Rise not: No, Rhaicos, no! Without the nuptial vow Love is unholy. Swear to me that none Of mortal maids shall ever taste thy kiss, Then take thou mine; then take it, not before. Rhaicos. Hearken, all gods above! O Aphroditè! O Herè! let my vow be ratified! But wilt thou come into my father's house? Hamadryad. Nay: and of mine I can not give thee part. Rhaicos. Where is it? Hamadryad. In this oak. Rhaicos. Ay; now begins The tale of Hamadryad: tell it through. Hamadryad. Pray of thy father never to cut down My tree; and promise him, as well thou mayst, That every year he shall receive from me More honey than will buy him nine fat sheep, More wax than he will burn to all the gods. Why fallest thou upon thy face? Some thorn May scratch it, rash young man! Rise up; for shame! Rhaicos. For shame I can not rise. O pity me! I dare not sue for love . . but do not hate! Let me once more behold thee . . not once more, But many days: let me love on . . unloved! I aimed too high: on my head the bolt Falls back, and pierces to the very brain. Hamadryad. Go . . rather go, than make me say I love. Rhaicos. If happiness is immortality, (And whence enjoy it else the gods above?) I am immortal too: my vow is heard: Hark! on the left . . Nay, turn not from me now, I claim my kiss. Hamadryad. Do men take first, then claim? Do thus the seasons run their course with them? . . Her lips were seal'd, her head sank on his breast. 'Tis said that laughs were heard within the wood: But who should hear them? . . and whose laughs? and why? Savoury was the smell, and long past noon, Thallinos! in thy house; for marjoram, Basil and mint, and thyme and rosemary, Were sprinkled on the kid's well roasted length, Awaiting Rhaicos. Home he came at last, Not hungry, but pretending hunger keen, With head and eyes just o'er the maple plate. “Thou seest but badly, coming from the sun, Boy Rhaicos!” said the father. “That oak's bark Must have been tough, with little sap between; It ought to run; but it and I are old.” Rhaicos, although each morsel of the bread Increast by chewing, and the meat grew cold And tasteless to his palate, took a draught Of gold-bright wine, which, thirsty as he was, He thought not of until his father fill'd The cup, averring water was amiss, But wine had been at all times pour'd on kid, It was religion. He thus fortified Said, not quite boldly, and not quite abasht, “Father, that oak is Zeusis own; that oak Year after year will bring thee wealth from wax And honey. There is one who fears the gods And the gods love . . that one” (He blusht, nor said What one) “Hath promist this, and may do more. We have not many moons to wait until The bees have done their best: if then there come Nor wax nor honey, let the trees be hewn.” “Zeus hath bestow'd on thee a prudent mind,” Said the glad sire: “but look thou often there, And gather all the honey thou canst find In every crevice, over and above What hath been promist; would they reckon that?” Rhaicos went daily; but the nymph as oft Invisible. To play at love, she knew, Stopping its breathings when it breathes most soft, Is sweeter than to play on any pipe. She play'd on his: she fed upon his sighs; They pleas'd her when they gently waved her hair, Cooling the pulses of her purple veins, And when her absence brought them out they pleas'd. Even among the fondest of them all, What mortal or immortal maid is more Content with giving happiness than pain? One day he was returning from the wood Despondently. She pitied him, and said “Come back!” and twined her fingers in the hem Above his shoulder. Then she led his steps To a cool rill that ran o'er level sand Through lentisk and through oleander, there Bathed she his feet, lifting them on her lap When bathed, and drying them in both her hands. He dared complain; for those who most are loved Most dare it; but not harsh was his complaint. “O thou inconstant!” said he, “if stern law Bind thee, or will, stronger than sternest law, O, let me know henceforward when to hope The fruit of love that grows for me but here.” He spake; and pluckt it from its pliant stem. “Impatient Rhaicos! why thus intercept The answer I would give? There is a bee Whom I have fed, a bee who knows my thoughts And executes my wishes: I will send That messenger. If ever thou art false, Drawn by another, own it not, but drive My bee away: then shall I know my fate, And, . . for thou must be wretched, . . weep at thine. But often as my heart persuades to lay Its cares on thine and throb itself to rest, Expect her with thee, whether it be morn, Or eve, at any time when woods are safe.” Day after day the Hours beheld them blest, And season after season: years had past, Blest were they still. He who asserts that Love Ever is sated of sweet things, the same Sweet things he fretted for in earlier days, Never, by Zeus! loved he a Hamadryad. The nights had now grown longer, and perhaps The Hamadryads find them lone and dull Among their woods; one did, alas! She called Her faithful bee: 'twas when all bees should sleep, And all did sleep but hers. She was sent forth To bring that light which never wintry blast Blows out, nor rain nor snow extinguishes, The light that shines from loving eyes upon Eyes that love back, till they can see no more. Rhaicos was sitting at his father's hearth: Between them stood the table, not o'erspread With fruits which autumn now profusely bore, Nor anise cakes, nor odorous wine; but there The draft-board was expanded; at which game Triumphant sat old Thallinos; the son Was puzzled, vext, discomfited, distraught. A buzz was at his ear: up went his hand, And it was heard no longer. The poor bee Return'd (but not until the morn shone bright) And found the Hamadryad with her head Upon her aching wrist, and showed one wing Half-broken off, the other's meshes marr'd, And there were bruises which no eye could see Saving a Hamadryad's. At this sight Down fell the languid brow, both hands fell down, A shriek was carried to the ancient hall Of Thallinos: he heard it not: his son Heard it, and ran forthwith into the wood. No bark was on the tree, no leaf was green, The trunk was riven through. From that day forth Nor word nor whisper sooth'd his ear, nor sound Even of insect wing: but loud laments The woodmen and the shepherds one long year Heard day and night; for Rhaicos would not quit The solitary place, but moan'd and died. Hence milk and honey wonder not, O guest, To find set duly on the hollow stone. ACON AND RHODOPE; OR, INCONSTANCY. The Year's twelve daughters had in turn gone by, Of measured pace tho' varying mien all twelve, Some froward, some sedater, some adorn'd For festival, some reckless of attire. The snow had left the mountain-top; fresh flowers Had withered in the meadow; fig and prune Hung—wrinkling; the last apple glow'd amid Its freckled leaves; and weary oxen blinkt Between the trodden corn and twisted vine, Under whose bunches stood the empty crate, To creak ere long beneath them carried home. This was the season when twelve months before, O gentle Hamadryad, true to love! Thy mansion, thy dim mansion in the wood Was blasted and laid desolate: but none Dared violate its precincts, none dared pluck The moss beneath it, which alone remain'd Of what was thine. Old Thallinos sat mute In solitary sadness. The strange tale (Not until Rhaicos died, but then the whole) Echeion had related, whom no force Could ever make look back upon the oaks. The father said “Echeion! thou must weigh, Carefully, and with steady hand, enough (Although no longer comes the store as once!) Of wax to burn all day and night upon That hollow stone where milk and honey lie: So may the Gods, so may the dead, be pleas'd!” Thallinos bore it thither in the morn, And lighted it and left it. First of those Who visited upon this solemn day The Hamadryad's oak, were Rhodope And Acon; of one age, one hope, one trust. Graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate She sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first Lapt by the flame of love: his father's lands Were fertile, herds lowed over them afar. Now stood the two aside the hollow stone And lookt with stedfast eyes towards the oak Shivered and black and bare. “May never we Love as they loved!” said Acon. She at this Smiled, for he said not what he meant to say, And thought not of its bliss, but of its end. He caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow'd Nor time nor other power, whereto the might Of love hath yielded and may yield again, Should alter his. The father of the youth Wanted not beauty for him, wanted not Song, that could lift earth's weight from off his heart, Discretion, that could guide him thro' the world, Innocence, that could clear his way to heaven; Silver and gold and land, not green before The ancestral gate, but purple under skies Bending far off, he wanted for his heir. Fathers have given life, but virgin heart They never gave; and dare they then control Or check it harshly? dare they break a bond Girt round it by the holiest Power on high? Acon was grieved, he said, grieved bitterly, But Acon had complied . . 'twas dutiful! Crush thy own heart, Man! Man! but fear to wound The gentler, that relies on thee alone, By thee created, weak or strong by thee; Touch it not but for worship; watch before Its sanctuary; nor leave it till are closed The temple-doors and the last lamp is spent. Rhodope, in her soul's waste solitude, Sate mournful by the dull-resounding sea, Often not hearing it, and many tears Had the cold breezes hardened on her cheek. Meanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks, Nor shun'd to look upon the hollow stone That held the milk and honey, nor to lay His plighted hand where recently 'twas laid Opposite hers, when finger playfully Advanced and pusht back finger, on each side. He did not think of this, as she would do If she were there alone. The day was hot; The moss invited him; it cool'd his cheek, It cool'd his hands; he thrust them into it And sank to slumber. Never was there dream Divine as his. He saw the Hamadryad. She took him by the arm and led him on Along a valley, where profusely grew The smaller lilies with their pendent bells, And, hiding under mint, chill drosera, The violet shy of butting cyclamen, The feathery fern, and, browser of moist banks, Her offspring round her, the soft strawberry; The quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk, The oleander's light-hair'd progeny Breathing bright freshness in each other's face, And graceful rose, bending her brow, with cup Of fragrance and of beauty, boon for Gods. The fragrance fill'd his breast with such delight His senses were bewildered, and he thought He saw again the face he most had loved. He stopt: the Hamadryad at his side Now stood between; then drew him farther off: He went, compliant as before: but soon Verdure had ceast: altho' the ground was smooth, Nothing was there delightful. At this change He would have spoken, but his guide represt All questioning, and said, “Weak youth! what brought Thy footstep to this wood, my native haunt, My life-long residence? this bank, where first I sate with him . . the faithful (now I know, Too late!) the faithful Rhaicos. Haste thee home; Be happy, if thou canst; but come no more Where those whom death alone could sever, died.” He started up: the moss whereon he slept Was dried and withered: deadlier paleness spread Over his cheek; he sickened: and the sire Had land enough; it held his only son. CATILLUS AND SALIA. Catillus left his spear upon the steps Of that old temple which from Ciminus Looks o'er the lake and the dark ilexes. Often his horse, standing alone before The columns, starts at sights obscurely seen; Sometimes at roar of raging beast, sometimes At bark that bursts and crackles from the cork, Or at the rapid whirl of withered leaves Wafted and rattling on his bridle-bit. “Voltumna!” pray'd the youth, “reject not thou My vows! for Salia is my heart consumed; Nor does the sire or maiden disapprove; But there are ancient oracles that hold The torch of Hymen back. Thou knowest well, O Goddess! (for from thy own fane proceed These oracles) what menaces impend. So great an evil be it mine to ward From both! Yet how? He who could all foresee, Amphiaräus, he might have advised; But earth before him opened, and with flames Enveloping his chariot, drank it in. Where in far regions, famed Ismenos flows He left his children and the light of day. “The Tuscan shore a race of fugitives Alights on. O that they had come in guise Of enemies! not (as they say) of friends: Because old seers have seen, old prophets sung That under this the royal house should fall And royal bride be wedded, to her sire's And people's ruin. Clearly I discern What Fate before had hidden; nor retreat; Nor arms, wherever they may lead, refuse; Nor absence . . long, for ever; nor the gulph Of Styx, which all must pass; nor, what is worse, In other lands to wander; be but thou Mine for one day, O Salia! no one's else And least of any one an exile's bride!” A hollow murmur shakes the beech-tree-tops; A voice is heard; “Of wretched father, child More wretched! how wouldst thou have fled before, If thou hadst ever known the curse to come!” It ceases: loudly, as the portal closed, Resounded in their depths the woods profound. The youth is sunk in prayer, and all again Is silent, in the sky, the grove, the fane, Nor could he see above him any bird Whose flight should comfort him; for right and left Rose the huge branches, and after the swans Shone out serenely on the lake serene, Soothing the under-wing with neck reverst. He wishes not for fields of waving vine, He wishes not for olive-boundary, Planted when first the blindfold boy had drawn The lot of each Pelasgian from the win, But he does wish for Salia, he does wish To see Volsinii, blessed land, again. Then of the king he thinks, and then revolves Commands which both had given (and one with tears), Unless Voltumna look with placid smile Toward the couch of Hymen. Evening came: He threw him on the ground; he sought for dreams, If haply sleep should calm his weariness, Dreams that from sire and daughter may remove The unknown peril that o'ershadows both. Sharp was the splendour of the stars; all heaven Seem'd moving as it never yet had moved; To mortal power insuperable, fate Bent easily before him; every word Of oracles had now grown plain enough; And he resolv'd to save at once the king And the king's daughter, do they what they would And fear'd they all that ever could be fear'd. Amid these thoughts his yielding senses sleep Impresses: in his dream he hears the arms Of guest and ravisher: he sees (can sight Deceive him?) Salia. With her own consent Is she borne off? and, when her father calls Pursuing her, disdains she to return? He starts, he raves, strikes with his brow the ground, Springs up, and, seizing on the bridle, leaps Into the saddle, and before 'tis dawn Reaches the city's outskirt. Long the land In peace had rested; scanty was its watch; All knew the cordial youth who, strong of limb, Joyous of countenance and prompt of speech And large of liberality, and first On foot or horseback, hurl'd the Argive spear; Straight went he onward where the palace stood, And stationed under its first turret found The friendly Periphas. “I haste,” he cried, “I haste to Salia. Help me. That is nigh, That which she fears, her father more than she, And never may perhaps by arms avert: Voltumna threatens it. Her father's love May blind his eyes, but my love opens mine. I bring the Goddess's own words, and these The dreams she breath'd into my breast confirm.” Ever to Dian at the break of day Did Salia bear her sacrifice: the gate Was this thro' which she past into her grove And little chapel. Thickly sound the hoofs Of fretting horse beneath the turret's arch, And the last light of lamp that hangs therefrom, Crackling, now hides now shows the whiten'd iron. When casts the hind, with broken sleep morose, The wooden collar round his ox's neck And rope athwart the horns, when one red line Borders the dull horizon, and the fields Under the drowsy skies lie indistinct, There stands the royal maiden. “Hence! fly hence! O Salia!” cries Catillus, “and believe The Gods are now propitious.” At the word On his high steed he lifts her, with a leap Mounts, and redoubles with a rapid spur His courser's speed. “Tremble not,” cried the youth: “A time there was indeed for fear, when flight Was none, and hope uncertain. From her shrine Dian inclining to thy prayers and vows Would, if she ever uttered oracle, Have bidden what Voltumna hath ordain'd. The horse is quiet: see! he frets no more: And none are following. Is my arm too tight? Bends it unwelcome round thee? Fearest thou? Wouldst thou prohibit, wouldst thou chide, my fears? I loosen it. Why weep and sigh? why doubt? In Tibur who should envy us a life Of country peace? To what ferocious man Canst thou be there a prey? what war molest Thy father? For no realm we fight; we hold The only realm we want. I leave behind The Sabines and their ruler to enjoy Untroubled peace. Instead of fields in dower, Fields which suspicion everywhere surrounds With the uncertain faith of hireling arms, Be there for us the deep repose of woods, Walls that have never heard the name of Mars, Tibur, and those green pastures on the banks Thro' which Pareusius winds his silvery stream. Look back; how widely spreads the space behind Volsinii how remote! the citadel How reddening lower and lower with larger light At this she raises up her eyes, not quite Up to his eyes who speaks to her; then looks Back on her father's city; then they fill With gushing tears. “Live, father! live in peace Voltumna claims me; can then piety Forbid, or any care obstruct my course? Follow I must the Goddess's command. The desert, the dense darkness of the woods, The lake, with all their gloom and all its own, I would thro' life inhabit, nor repine, Let but the Fates grant tranquil days to thee!” Moved at her tenderness, Catillus said, “Behold them granted! and shall she whose prayers Have won them for her parent, not rejoice? Voltumna well might choose thee for her own, But she was silent; nay, she gave commands Right opposite; she bade thee leave thy home, Thy father's house: thou wisely hast obey'd, And child so duteous she from far will hear. Meanwhile an aged priestess keeps the fane, One only: such its holiness, no time Will ever move it. Thou shalt see the dells Of Tibur, the Albunean lake, its shades And floating islands, and (what oft thy wish Shuddering at all the terrors of the tale Urged thee to see) the fissured rock, the rush Of angry waters, and, where these subside, Glens where is heard the song of Nymphs below. There be our country, there our house, and there Our early days and later! All thy life Must thou be happy in a father saved And faith saved too: and no less happy he, Obedient to the dictate of the Fates, In that he gave not (tho' he wisht to give) Salia to him who holds her to his heart.” Salia now calmer, bids him to repeat All that Voltumna said. The Goddess's Behest she thinks obscure, the danger clear; She sighs; but piety distrusts not love. Scarce the first hour of flight had past away Before the father knew it. Idle time He lost not in complaint, nor idle threats Threw at the fugitive: he gave command Forthwith that chosen youths surround the woods And moorlands of Capenus, occupy Every hill-top, keep equal distances At certain stations, and from each, right, left, The subject land, wood, river, lake, survey. He himself hastened onward, and before Noontide he saw, not distant, to the east, Eretus, its wide woodland overgrown With speckled arbutus, and, farther on And higher up, an ancient temple, white In the sun's splendour, on its mound apart: Beyond it the Nomentan hills retired. And now, inclosed by mountains, he approacht The steep red banks and turbid stream profound Of Tiber. Never had that stream been crost By bridge of stone convex, or mountain pine, Nor level boats in surging series linkt Made plain the way for horseman and for horse. He bends, and raises in his hollow hand The sacred water, and thus prays the God. “O father Tiber! if thou hast preserv'd Thy people quiet by religious awe; If thou beholdest thy Apollo's hill Soracte bound in duteous equity; If the Faliscians, righteous race, impress The burning ember with unflinching heel; If, when the robber Cacus he had slain, Alcides (which our sires have seen) washt off That robber's blood in thy most cleansing lymph; If stolen herds brought vengeance down on him Whom none consorted with, no host receiv'd; Shall I in vain implore thee for thy help Against a wretch who robs his host of all, Who carries off his child, his only child? Avenge me: give me only ('tis enough) To swim in safety o'er thy rapid stream.” Thus praying, his huge spear he threw across; Whereat the steed which bore him shrilly neigh'd, Rear'd, and with hoof inverted scraped the turf, And, call'd by name and patted and cheer'd on, Sprang bravely down and clove the surging waves: They bent beneath his lusty neck, they broke At every breath his widening nostril breath'd, And his rich trappings flasht fresh light around. In the late hour of eve the king surveys The highths of Tibur; to the walls he wends Alone; to Coras, and him only, cries That he come out. But Coras, when he knew Afar Catillus by his burnisht arms, Ran from the rampart to embrace the king, And said “Where is my brother?” Fiercelier burns His rage at this, and “Like a slave he fled; Nor shall it now avail thee to conceal His flight; thy walls shall show him in their flames. Now let him arm . . a father calls, a guest, Despoil'd, dishonor'd . . let him arm before The hospitable the avenging Jove He thinks he may affront, deceive, despise.” The brother stood astonisht: lifting up Both hands to heaven, “No brother is with me, I swear, and therefor lay aside thy wrath, O king! and under happy auspices Await in peace and patience his return.” He answered not, but rudely rusht away. With angry looks the Argive nobles cried “What, tyrant! dost thou threaten war? say first, Proud as thy nation is of ancient fame, Say when on Ciminus hath ever oak Borne trophy? while the fatten'd hiefer shakes The flowery fillet and salt-sprinkled crown, Do their round cheeks, well form'd for puffing horns, Turn into waxen whiteness at the approach Of level'd spears. If (faith of Gods and men!) Thou darest threaten us with fire or sword, We will not wait thee in our walls, but show Thy city, and all cities leagued with thee, How the proud Tuscans first cried out for peace.” The last late sunbeam of the summer sky Had fallen, and with dew far superfused The fuming meadows of Pareusius paled, Far as the Albula and Latian plain. When Tibur's citadel had sunk to view The king alighted from his horse, and spent A weary night beneath a peasant's roof. Near to Volsinii, with a clear cold stream There runs a rivulet and intercepts The little rills that trickle thro' the grove, And falls into the Tiber where it looks Into the glades of Umbria; 'twas this course Catillus followed thro' its whole extent. Here, where it join'd the Tiber, pusht he forth A narrow skiff, tied with a twisted band Of osier to the tree. The oar's smooth palm Divided the broad water-leaves and won An easy way. Now, while the waves it made With gentle plash and pattering heav'd the bark, Thou, Salia, sattest at thy lover's side Stiller and calmer than that shady stream. Catillus then would hoist his little sail, That he might lay aside the oar, and hold The rope which turn'd it as the river turn'd Or the wind caught it, and that he might sit On the same bench with Salia, and protect From the hot sun her face beneath its shade. He fear'd to pass where hinds might see and shout, He fear'd all voices, most of all he fear'd The irreverent Fescennine's immodest song. Volsinii's firm allies, the Sabines held That country where amid the flowers he rears Runs Farfar, and that barrener wherefrom Himella shrinks when Sirius strikes his stream. So now he took the simple guise of hind Who had gone early forth, and must return To hail his household Deities at eve. Rushes and reeds conceal'd his crest and spear. Long was the way by land, by water long, Nor would the youth, nor could he had he will'd, Tell Salia how much farther they must go. Her dread of any seeing her he calm'd, Saying, “Look up! behold what scanty light Sheds Hesper, how he swings upon the stream Alone of all the stars, and what calm gloom Propitious sits upon the brow of heaven.” They both weave sleepless dreams. In days to come What will their pleasure be, if touch of hand Kindles such fires; if at one word, one glance, Disperst is every doubt and every fear. Ah! be not wise, ye young! but from bright days Look into brighter: evermore believe: Be this your wisdom. At the close of life, We know too much; we know we are deceiv'd. Needless the story were in what converse Hour followed hour; what cultur'd lands, what wilds Delighted them; how many were the spots In whose retirement they could spend their lives: Needless to mention how, amid the pause, A bough impending o'er the stream sometimes Swept, ere they were aware, the vessel's side, Startling and reddening her with girlish fright. The youth too had his fears, but held them in. He fear'd if any silent matron stole Down to the river-side, in quest of him Her children cried for ere they went to bed: He fear'd if suddenly a lamp-light burst With long effulgence from some cot unseen Across the water, or a fisherman Had crown'd his net with flame, and, dipt in pitch, The feathery cane its finny prey allured. Onward they sail all night: when morn appears, Seeing that friendly Tibur was behind, He leaves (in view, though distant) on his right Seven far-famed hills, where stood the residence Of King Evander, sprung from Arcady; Janus on one had rear'd a muniment, And Saturn on another: he admired How such vast works had ever been destroy'd. Wonder may seize, but can not long detain, And least the young and ardent. Rowing back, Catillus rises on the oar and glides Into his native land. “O mine!” he cries, “Mine surely now! come, Salia, come, enjoy In safety and by right our freedom here: No Gods oppose us: we are here at home.” And as he speaks, swifter he plies the oar. Soon helmets blaze above the copse; men arm'd And unarm'd welcome him; stout hinds belay The laboring bark, tugging it where the wind Baffles the sail; then, smoking from afield, Laborious oxen and stout-hearted steeds. But, tho' they aided, slower seem'd the hour Than yesterday, when lay the oar athwart And the loose sail flapt idly round the mast. Both wisht to be alone again; nor long Abstain'd Catillus (when the cliff began To chafe the water and impede the way) From ordering to haul the skiff ashore. Alone then were they. He ascends the path, The well-known path of the old wood; he stops, Here, lest the stones should hurt her; here, because The grass is softer than all grass beside; Here, because sunny hazels most invite; And here, because no serpent ever coils Beneath the ashen shade. Such leisure-hour Fatigue and sense of safety make more sweet. “Up! Salia! one more hill we must ascend, Whence Tibur, now thy own, thou mayst descry.” They reach the summit. What, across yon chasm, Fixes the maid her eyes upon? A breeze Whitens the waving willows as they bend, And ancient elms cast shadows long and dark, And the lithe tendril of the vine unpruned Pats and springs up and pats again the stream. What sees she from the summit there? why gaze? Why tremble? why turn pale? Behold! there stands Her father! You might have believ'd her knees Had turn'd to marble. “Wretched girl!” he cried, “Whom dost thou fly from?” At that voice she starts. Swifter and swifter hurried she along And thought each step was slower than the last. Ambiguous was it from the fields or town Whether she tore the youth away (her hand Holding his spear through terror at the wrath Of sire and prophet) or his arm made firm Her step precipitous: but she was first Where the road narrowed, fit for one alone, And he where, leaning down for her, his spear Protruded helpt her up the rock abrupt. Indignant Anius saw them from below Receiv'd into the city's double gate With loud acclaim and trumpet's louder clang; And from the aërial citadel the girls One to another show'd him, and with taunts Bade him begone. He rushes to the wood Resounding o'er the river: but not clash Of cataract hears he, nor wild shout, nor dash Roaring above, redoubled underneath, And far away thro' cavern'd rocks prolong'd: Nor rage impels him now nor tears dissolve, He only presses with both hands his brow. Ah! from what bitter source must flow the grief Such scenes assuage not! There he stood, nor saw Pareusius whirl his torrent deep below, Whence watery dust eternal intercepts The light of heaven. Dark ilex, bright-hair'd beech, And, vainly fostering ever-fruitless vine, The loftier elm, mass above mass, arise. Among the branches thousands birds appear To raise their little throats, but every song Fast as it flows the roaring torrent drowns. Some, by assiduous helpmate undetain'd, Fly from the eternal thunder of the waves; These . . leave them only sheltering bough, and moss To soften for their young the nest they knit . . Nor rains can chill nor thunders shake their love. By rocks inclosed, sore fretting, and resolv'd No force shall quell it, rushes the array Of water, now united, scattered now, Again to rally: pale is overhead The mountain, pale and trembling; to its sides The splasht herbs cling the closer: many a reed Is there which never shall sigh forth the plaint Of the lone shepherd, many a flower is there On virgin bosom never to recline. But numberless bright intermingled rays Spring up, whence Jove and Phœbus raise an arch Lofty and wide, and Iris dwells within. Wrong, upon earth imperious, may o'erpower And crush the mortal; Virtue may stand back Nor help him; even the clemency of Heaven May fail; the urn, the ashes laid within, Violence may scatter; but on those who die Thro' wretchedness, and undeservedly, Compassionate and faithful verse attends And drives oblivion from the wasted tomb. O why, ye Gods! why, in such lands as these, Fairest of earth, and where ye chose to dwell, Should burst forth anguish from a father's breast? Why from the guiltless Anius? Who brought gifts More gladly to your altars? who more pure? In part he uttered this, in part supprest; Then added, “Here is piety! and thus Doth she requite her father! Duteous, chaste, Benevolent, all thought her; and to all, Excepting me, she was so; I alone Less than a stranger merited her love. Now know I what (Oh! lesson hard to learn At all times! how much harder for the old!) A daughter owes a father. “O my wife! If Libitina had allow'd thy stay, To see me so far left behind in love (Our fond contention) thou hadst surely griev'd. I took the mother's place. When any pain, However slight, she suffered, could I rest? Or could I leave her couch? “Go, snatch the torch Of Hymen, run, mingle thy song with theirs, From tranquil brow draw down the saffron veil, And be thy children, if they can, like thee. If every other rite thou hast disdain'd, If scorn'd the dower a royal bride should bring, If thro' three nations, shameless, thou hast fled, Blame, blame thy parent for it. He provides At least a victim for so blest a day.” He spake; and from the woody mountain-top, Where by the eternal battery of the waves A way is cloven, cast himself. From rock To rock he fell; and all the dew that rose Around was dimly reddened with his blood. The fact is well recorded: while the name Of old Pereusius few remember, thine O Anius, sounds for ever on that stream. ENALLOS AND CYMODAMEIA. A vision came o'er three young men at once, A vision of Apollo: each had heard The same command; each followed it; all three Assembled on one day before the God In Lycia, where he gave his oracle. Bright shone the morning; and the birds that build Their nests beneath the column-heads of fanes And eaves of humbler habitations, dropt From under them and wheel'd athwart the sky, When, silently and reverently, the youths Marcht side by side up the long steps that led Toward the awful God who dwelt within. Of those three youths fame hath held fast the name Of one alone; nor would that name survive Unless love had sustain'd it, and blown off With his impatient breath the mists of time. “Ye come,” the God said mildly, “of one will To people what is desert in the isle Of Lemnos: but strong men possess its shores; Nor shall you execute the brave emprize Unless, on the third day from going forth, To him who rules the waters ye devote A virgin, cast into the sea alive.” They heard, and lookt in one another's face, And then bent piously before the shrine With prayer and praises and thanksgiving hymn, And, after a short silence, went away, Taking each other's hand and swearing truth, Then to the ship in which they came, return'd. Two of the youths were joyous, one was sad; Sad was Enallos; yet those two by none Were loved; Enallos had already won Cymodameia, and the torch was near. By night, by day, in company, alone, The image of the maiden fill'd his breast To the heart's brim. Ah! therefore did that heart So sink within him. They have sail'd; they reach Their home again. Sires, matrons, maidens, throng The plashing port, to watch the gather'd sail, And who springs first and farthest upon shore. Enallos came the latest from the deck, Swift ran the rumour what the God had said, And fearful were the maidens, who before Had urged the sailing of the youths they loved, That they might give their hands, and have their homes, And nurse their children; and more thoughts perhaps Led up to these, and even ran before. But they persuaded easily their wooers To sail without them, and return again When they had seiz'd the virgin on the way. Cymodameia dreamt three nights, the three Before their fresh departure, that her own Enallos had been cast into the deep, And she had saved him. She alone embarkt Of all the maidens, and unseen by all, And hid herself before the break of day Among the cloaks and fruits piled high aboard. But when the noon was come, and the repast Was call'd for, there they found her; and they call'd Enallos: when Enallos lookt upon her, Forebodings shook him: hopes rais'd her, and love Warm'd the clear cheek while she wiped off the spray. Kindly were all to her and dutiful; And she slept soundly mid the leaves of fig And vine, and far as far could be apart. Now the third morn had risen, and the day Was dark, and gusts of wind and hail and fogs Perplext them: land they saw not yet, nor knew Where land was lying. Sudden lightnings blazed, Thunder-claps rattled round them. The pale crew Howl'd for the victim. “Seize her, or we sink.” O maid of Pindus! I would linger here To lave my eyelids at the nearest rill, For thou hast made me weep, as oft thou hast, Where thou and I, apart from living men, And two or three crags higher, sate and sang. Ah! must I, seeing ill my way, proceed? And thy voice too, Cymodameia! thine Comes back upon me, helpless as thyself In this extremity. Sad words! sad words! “O save me! save! Let me not die so young Loving thee so! let me not cease to see thee!” Thus prayed Cymodameia. Thus prayed he. “O God! who givest light to all the world, Take not from me what makes that light most blessed! Grant me, if 'tis forbidden me to save This hapless helpless sea-devoted maid, To share with her (and bring no curses up From outraged Neptune) her appointed fate!” They wrung her from his knee; they hurl'd her down (Clinging in vain at the hard slippery pich) Into the whitening wave. But her long hair Scarcely had risen up again before Another plunge was heard, another form Clove the straight line of bubbling foam, direct As ringdove after ringdove. Groans from all Burst, for the roaring sea ingulpht them both. Onward the vessel flew; the skies again Shone bright, and thunder roll'd along, not wroth, But gently murmuring to the white-wing'd sails. Lemnos at close of evening was in sight. The shore was won; the fields markt out; and roofs Collected the dun wings that seek house-fare; And presently the ruddy-bosom'd guest Of winter, knew the doors: then infant cries Were heard within; and lastly tottering steps Pattered along the image-stationed hall. Ay, three full years had come and gone again, And often, when the flame on windy nights Suddenly flicker'd from the mountain-ash Piled high, men pusht almost from under them The bench on which they talkt about the dead. Meanwhile beneficent Apollo saw With his bright eyes into the sea's calm depth, And there he saw Enallos, there he saw Cymodameia. Gravely-gladsome light Environed them with its eternal green, And many nymphs sate round; one blew aloud The spiral shell; one drew bright chords across Shell more expansive; tenderly a third With cowering lip hung o'er the flute, and stopt At will its dulcet sob, or waked to joy; A fourth took up the lyre and pincht the strings, Invisible by trembling: many rais'd Clear voices. Thus they spent their happy hours. I know them all; but all with eyes downcast, Conscious of loving, have entreated me I would not utter now their names above. Behold, among these natives of the sea There stands but one young man: how fair! how fond! Ah! were he fond to them! It may not be! Yet did they tend him morn and eve; by night They also watcht his slumbers: then they heard His sighs, nor his alone; for there were two To whom the watch was hateful. In despair Upward he raised his arms, and thus he prayed, “O Phœbus! on the higher world alone Showerest thou all thy blessings? Great indeed Hath been thy favour to me, great to her; But she pines inly, and calls beautiful More than herself the Nymphs she sees around, And asks me ‘Are they not more beautiful?’ Be all more beautiful, be all more blest, But not with me! Release her from the sight; Restore her to a happier home, and dry With thy pure beams, above, her bitter tears!” She saw him in the action of his prayer, Troubled, and ran to soothe him. From the ground, Ere she had claspt his neck, her feet were borne. He caught her robe; and its white radiance rose Rapidly, all day long, through the green sea. Enallos loost not from that robe his grasp, But spann'd one ancle too. The swift ascent Had stunn'd them into slumber, sweet, serene, Invigorating her, nor letting loose The lover's arm below; albeit at last It closed those eyes intensely fixt thereon, And still as fixt in dreaming. Both were cast Upon an island till'd by peaceful men And few (no port nor road accessible) Fruitful and green as the abode they left, And warm with summer, warm with love and song. 'Tis said that some whom most Apollo loves Have seen that island, guided by his light; And others have gone near it, but a fog Rose up between them and the lofty rocks; Yet they relate they saw it quite as well, And shepherd-boys and pious hinds believe. PAN AND PITYS. Cease to complain of what the Gods decree, Whether by death or (harder!) by the hand Of one prefer'd thy loves be torn away, For even against the bourn of Arcady Beats the sad Styx, heaving its wave of tears, And nought on earth so high but Care flies higher. A maid was wooed by Boreas and by Pan, Pitys her name, her haunt the wood and wild; Boreas she fled from; with more placid eye Lookt she on Pan; yet chided him, and said . . “Ah, why should men or clearer-sighted Gods Propose to link our hands eternally? That which o'er raging seas is wildly sought Perishes and is trampled on in port; And they where all things are immutable Beside, even they, the very Gods, are borne Unsteadily wherever love impels; Even he whol rules Olympus, he himself Is lighter than the cloud beneath his feet. Lovers are ever an uncertain race, And they the most so who most loudly sing Of truth and ardour, anguish and despair, But thou above them all. Now tell me, Pan, How thou deceivedst the chaste maid of night, Cynthia, thou keeper of the snow-white flock! Thy reed had crackled with thy flames, and split With torture after torture; thy lament Had fill'd the hollow rocks; but when it came To touch the sheep-fold, there it paus'd and cool'd. Wonderest thou whence the story reacht my ear? Why open those eyes wider? why assume The ignorant, the innocent? prepared For refutation, ready to conceal The fountain of Selinos, waving here On the low water its long even grass, And there (thou better may'st remember this) Paved with smooth stones, as temples are. The sheep Who led the rest, struggled ere yet half-shorn, And dragged thee slithering after it: thy knee Bore long the leaves of ivy twined around To hide the scar, and still the scar is white. Dost thou deny the giving half thy flock To Cynthia? hiding tho' the better half, Then all begrimed producing it, while stood Well-washt and fair in puffy woolliness The baser breed, and caught the unpracticed eye.” Pan blusht, and thus retorted. “Who hath told That idle fable of an age long past? More just, perhaps more happy, hadst thou been, Shunning the false and flighty. Heard I have Boreas and his rude song, and seen the goats Stamp on the rock and lick the affrighted eyes Of their young kids; and thee too, then averse, I also saw, O Pitys! Is thy heart, To what was thy aversion, now inclined? Believest thou my foe? the foe of all I hold most dear. Had Cynthia been prefer'd She would not thus have taunted me: unlike Thee, Pitys, she looks down with gentle glance On them who suffer; whether they abide In the low cottage or the lofty tower She tends them, and with silent step alike And watchful eye their aching vigil soothes. I sought not Cynthia; Cynthia lean'd to me. Not pleased too easily, unlovely things She shuns, by lovely (and none else) detain'd. Sweet, far above all birds, is philomel To her; above all scenes the Padan glades And their soft-whispering poplars; sweet to her The yellow light of box-tree in full bloom Nodding upon Cytoros. She delights To wander thro' the twinkling olive-grove, And where in clusters on Lycæan knolls Redden the berries of the mountain-ash; In glassy fountain, and grey temple-top, And smooth sea-wave, when Hesperus hath left The hall of Tethys, and when liquid sounds (Uncertain whence) are wafted to the shore . . Never in Boreas.” “What a voice is thine!” She said, and smiled. “More roughly not himself Could sound with all his fury his own name. But come, thou cunning creature! tell me how Thou couldst inveigle Goddesses without Thinning thy sheepfold.” “What! again,” cried he, “Such tart and cool twitting? She received, Not as belov'd, but loving me, my gift. I gave her what she askt, and more had given, But half the flock was all that she required; Need therefor was it to divide in twain The different breeds, that she might make her choice. One, ever meagre, with broad bony front, Shone white enough, but harder than goat's hair The wool about it; and loud bleatings fill'd The plains it battened on . . for only plains It trod; and smelt . . as all such coarse ones smell. Avarice urged the Goddess: she sprang forth And took, which many more have done, the worse. “Why shake thy head? incredulous! Ah why, When none believe the truth, should I confess? Why, one who hates and scorns the lover, love? Once thou reposedest on the words I spake, And, when I ceast to speak, thou didst not cease To ponder them, but with thy cool plump palm Unconsciously didst stroke that lynx-skin down Which Bacchus gave me, toucht with virgin shame If any part slipt off and bared my skin. I then could please thee, could discourse, could pause, Could look away from that sweet face, could hide All consciousness that any hand of mine Had crept where lifted knee would soon unbend. Ah then how pleasant was it to look up (If thou didst too) from the green glebe supine, And drink the breath of all sweet herbs, and watch The last rays run along the level clouds, Until they kindle into living forms And sweep with golden net the western sky. Meanwhile thou notedst the dense troop of crows Returning on one track and at one hour In the same darkened intervals of heaven. Then mutual faith was manifest, but glad Of fresh avowal; then securely lay Pleasure, reposing on the crop she reapt. “The oleaster of the cliff; the vine Of leaf pellucid, clusterless, untamed; The tufts of cytisus that half-conceal'd The craggy cavern, narrow, black, profound; The scantier broom below it, that betray'd Those two white fawns to us . . what now are they? How the pine's whispers, how the simpering brook's, How the bright vapour trembling o'er the grass Could I enjoy, unless my Pitys took My hand and show'd me them; unless she blew My pipe when it was hoarse; and, when my voice Fail'd me, took up, and so inspired, my song.” Thus he, embracing with brown brawny arm Her soft white neck, not far from his declined, And with sharp finger parting her smooth hair. He paus'd. “Take now that pipe,” said she, “and since Thou findest joyance in things past, run o'er The race-course of our pleasures: first will I The loves . . of Boreas I abhor . . relate. He his high spirit, his uprooted oaks, And heaven confused with hailstones, may sing on: How into thine own realms his breath has blown The wasting flames, until the woods bow'd low Their heads with heavy groans, while he alert Shook his broad pinions and scream'd loud with joy. He may sing on, of shattered sails, of ships Sunk in the depths of ocean, and the sign Of that wide empire from Jove's brother torn; And how beneath the rocks of Ismaros Deluded he with cruel sport the dream That brought the lost one back again, and heard The Manes clap their hands at her return. Always his pastime was it, not to shake Light dreams away, but change them into forms Horrific; churl, from peace and truth averse. What in such rival ever couldst thou fear?” Boreas heard all she spoke, amid the brake Conceal'd: rage seiz'd him: the whole mountain shook. “Contemn'd!” said he, and as he said it, split A rock, and from the summit with his foot Spurn'd it on Pitys. Ever since, beneath That rock sits Pan: her name he calls; he waits Listening, to hear the rock repeat it; wipes The frequent tear from his hoarse reed, and wears Henceforth the pine, her pine, upon his brow. LEONTION, ON TERNISSA'S DEATH (EPICUROS ALSO DEPARTED). Behold, behold me, whether thou Art dwelling with the Shades below Or with the Gods above: With thee were even the Gods more blest . . I wish I could but share thy rest As once I shared thy love. 'Twas in this garden where I lean Against thy tombstone, once the scene Of more than mortal bliss, That loiter'd our Ternissa; sure She left me that her love was pure; It gave not kiss for kiss. Faint was the blush that overspread Thro' loosen'd hair her dying head; One name she utter'd, one She sigh'd and wept at; so wilt thou, If any sorrows reach thee now . . 'Twas not Leontion. Wert thou on earth thou wouldst not chide The gush of tears I could not hide Who ne'er hid aught from thee. Willing thou wentest on the way She went . . and am I doom'd to stay? No; we soon meet, all three. The flowers she cherisht I will tend, Nor gather, but above them bend And think they breathe her breath. Ah, happy flowers! ye little know Your youthful nurse lies close below, Close as in life in death. CORYTHOS. Œnone had been weeping, but the blast Bitterly cold had dried her tears, for high Upon the mountain stood she, where the grass Was short and dry, and where the fir-tree cones Roll'd as the whirlwind rusht along the down. Thence she beheld the walls and temples doom'd So soon to fall, and view'd her husband's roof, (Hers he was once, altho' another's now) And call'd their Corythos from out the wood. “Go,” said she, “go, my child! there is at Troy One who, without thy mother, may love thee. Thy father lives . . alas! lives unaware How few before him lie his destined days: For now from Lemnos Philoctetes comes And brings with him the deadly shafts bequeath'd By Hercules, wherewith, the Fates have sung, Paris must perish and the city fall. Hated thou wilt not be by her he loves, Altho' no child she ever bore to him And thou art mine, if thou canst but delay The hour foredoom'd: he may remember days Of other times, and how serene they were, Days when the poplar on its bark retain'd Two names inscribed by him, and when invoked Was Xanthos to bear witness to his vow. When his lost son hath saved him, and he knows He may not be ungrateful, but become The kinder father for unkindness past.” She mingled kisses with o'erflowing tears, Embraced him, then consigned him . . not at once . . To Agelaos: he was oft recall'd, And urged with admonitions fresh and fresh To keep as distant as was possible From wave sail-whitened and insidious shore, And every spot where Argive rampires rose. Downward, thro' crags and briars they wend their way. Fixt to the place, she heard not long the shout Of Corythos, nor outcry of shrill birds He pelted, whooping; then she turn'd around Toward her mountain home, and thus exclaim'd . . “Mountains and woods, the birthplace of my child, I see ye yet! he, dearer to my eyes, Is lost to them! Paris, once gone, return'd No more to me! alas! nor love remains Nor pledge of love! not only have I lost Him who might bring again to me past hours By countenance, by mien, by sound of laugh, By words persuasive, when presaging fear Darkened my brow, that cause was none for grief, I have lost here . . how little if success Follow the loss! . . all solace, all support! All things beside are just the same around. Xanthos and Simöis tremble at the touch Of early morning; then approaches me Tenedos, one unbroken mass distinct, And sidelong surges overleap the cliffs. I am changed nothing; nothing can I change: Such is the life of Nymphs; it must not cease, Nor must the comeliness of youth decay. Wretched! what look I back on? that frail gift And fugitive, which others grasp, I mourn. Œnone! O Œnone! beauteous once He thought thee; he whom thou wilt ever hold Beauteous and dear, now sees thee like the snow That lost its colour in a southern gale. How easy is it to snap off the bud Of tender life, and sow upon a breast Laid open ineradicable cares! How soon droops youth when faith, that propt it, fails! How often in her anguish would the maid Recall irrevocable hours, and grieve Most for the man whose future grief she sees! Asteropè, my sister! happy thou In him who loves but one! canst thou believe That Æsacos and Paris are cognate? But him the mild Arisbè bore; and him, Born of a furious River, Hecuba. I envy not alone the happier wed, But even the wretched who avoid the light, The unmarried, too, whose parents turn'd aside Their nuptial torch, and widows o'er whose beds Black wreaths are drooping; for the pang that death Inflicts, time may, tho' time alone, assuage. Where Nile besprinkles from his lotus-cup The nuptial floor; where sacred Ganges rolls Alike inscrutable his vaster stream, If Memnon's mother sheds ambrosial tears Before the sun arises; if, ye maids Of ocean, in the refuge of your caves Ye daily hear your Thetis wail her loss, Shunning wise Glaucos, deaf to Triton's shell, To Doris, and the Nymphs that wait around; If maids and matrons wail'd o'er Hector's corse, Mangled, and stretcht upon a tardy bier, Hector was still Andromache's, as when He drave before him the Achaian host, As when he tost his infant to his crest And laught that Hector's child could ever fear. What fault ye Gods was mine, unless to love And be deserted, and to pass my nights Among the haunts of beasts, where wolves and bears Break my first slumber, and my last, with howls, And the winds roar incessant from above? Perhaps the Gods hereafter may look down With gentler eyes, nor deem my fault so great. Howe'er it be, may Corythos be blest With other days, with better than pursuit Of stag, or net thrown over birds when driven By cold and hunger to scant oats unhous'd . . O may they grant him happier, and forbid That children suffer when their sires transgress.” Meanwhile the youth was stopping near the walls, And stood there wondering that e'en those, so vast, So lofty, had resisted such a host Under so many tents on all sides round. “But where is that old fig-tree? where the scene Of Hector and Achilles face to face? Where that of Venus when she drew the cloud Around my father to preserve his life?” Such were his questions, seizing the guide's hand, Hurrying him onward, and entreating him Forthwith to lead him into Troy itself, Even into Priam's house. Thus Agelaos Represses him. “Thy mother's sole command Was Onward! straight to Helena's abode.” An aged man, who heard the two converse, Stopt them. “O Dardan,” cried the impatient boy, “Say where dwells Helena?” “With sterner voice “Go,” said the Dardan, “the destroyer's court To all is open . . there it lies: pass on.” The youth threw instantly both arms around The old man's neck, and, “Blessed,” he exclaim'd, “Blessed, to whom my mother's injuries Are hateful! It is virtue so to hate The wicked Spartan. Here none other house Than Priam's will I enter, where with his Abides my father, where Andromachè Prostrate on earth bemoans her husband slain, While that bold wanton, fearing neither Pan Nor Zeus, with busy needle works, I ween, For other temples golden tapestries, Or twitches the shrill harp with nail of Sphynx.” Many, as they were speaking, past them by. One woman, pausing, askt them if the ships Could be discern'd from Ida whence they came, And whether favourable were the winds For their departure: to the eld she spake, But gazed upon the youth: he saw her cheeks Redden and pale; his guide too, not unmoved, Thought, if in Ilion be such beauty, who Would turn a glance elsewhere, tho' all the Gods And all the Goddesses might promise more? Now saw the youth, nor had he seen till now, The maidens following her; their vests succinct, Their hair close-braided; faultless all in form, All modest in demeanour. Not so fast The motion of his heart when rusht the boar Into his toils, and knotty cornel spear Whiz'd as it struck the bristles, and the tusks Rattled with gnashing rage thro' boiling blood. Whither were going they, she gently askt. “To where Assaracos and Ilos dwelt,” Replied the elder, “where dwells Paris now.” Then she, “The way is safer shown by us, And sooner will ye find him when he leaves The citadel. At early dawn he heard A clamour from the coast; and soon a skiff Was seen: an old man landed; one alone Came with him; 'twas Odysseus; more behind. Soon roam'd the sailors, culling on the coast Bay and verbena; soon was every prow Glimmering with these unhoped-for signs of peace.” Shaking his head, the Idæan answered thus. “'Twas surely Philoctetes who arrived. The arms he bears were those of Hercales, And now the bow of Nessos and the shafts Infected by the Hydra, come against The falling city of Laomedon.” Struck by the words she heard, the more she wisht To hear, the quicker went she on, and bade Her damsels hasten too: she did look back, Yet hasten'd. The Idæan strangers moved Tardily now thro' crowds who stood before The house of Hector: there they stood; there came Widows and maids and matrons, carrying Honey (the outraged Manes to appease) And children on their shoulders, who lookt up, Stretching their eyes, stretching their bodies out To see their equal-aged Astyanax. The older and the younger wept alike At the morn silence: all things were laid waste Around the roof-tree of their hero's house. The palace now they reach where Paris dwelt; They wonder at the wide and lofty dome, The polisht columns and the brazen forms Of heroes and of Gods, and marble steps, And valves resounding at the gates unbarr'd. They enter them. What ivory! and what gold! What breathing images depicted there! Dædalos had enricht the Cretan king With divers; and his daughter when she fled With Theseus, who had slain the Minotaur, Brought part away within his hollow ship; And these were Helena's: a scient hand Drew her, the fairest, foremost into light Among the girls she danced with, while the Gods Of heaven and ocean gazed on her alone. Above them sate the Sire of all, and nigh She who on Cypros landed from her shell; Curl'd conchs less bright the round-eyed Tritons blew. Helena sent for Paris: what had said The shepherd she related, but one fact Repressing . . who the mother of the boy, And whom the boy resembled. Such was once Paris, the guest of Sparta; but ten years Had cull'd and carried off the flower of youth. She thought not in these moments of his flight Inglorious from the spear of Diomed, Of nearer peril thought she; he, reclined Upon his purple couch, her fear controll'd. “No Philoctetes is arrived, afar Sits he, alone upon the Lesbian rock, Heavy with mortal wound; a wing drives off The beasts from worrying their expected prey, Often he waves it o'er his weary head Lest vulture settle on it, often sees The brazen breast of eagle close above, Too weak his voice to scare it off, too weak His groans, tho' louder. Thinkest he who bore All this from faithless friend, who sits athirst, Ahungered, on the beach, who bends his ear Down to the earth and hears the pulse of oars Fainter and fainter, and the seaman's song Lively as ever, and while he bemoans His wasting and immedicable wound . . What can Lernæan arrow do against us? Grant, if that far-famed bowman limp across The heavy sands crisp with Achaian gore, Year after year, in flakes not washt away, Where lies our danger? He but comes to find Broken the chariot that had drag'd along Hector, the blackened pyre where Ajax lies, The corslet of Patroclos. Lo, O Troy! Those mighty hands that threaten now thy fall! Now is the time for us to turn our backs, To leave our heritage, to leave the fane Of Pallas, fane inviolate till now, The roofs that Neptune helpt her to erect, And over which Apollo, shining forth And shouting and exhorting, bent his bow. An old man bears an older on his back, Odysseus Philoctetes. Aye, 'tis time, My Helena, our footsteps to retrace Toward Mycænai: let us bear away Our household Gods, by former wars unmoved . . Carry thou the Palladion in thy breast That trembles so with pious fear, and bring Gifts to Diana on Taÿgetos! The rampire of the Achaians is o'erthrown; The Myrmidons are scattered; every tent Lies open . . that is little . . for, behold! A lame man wins the race and grasps the prize! While dark invidious Heré exercised Her hatred on her judge, and arm'd the son Of Tydeus, and while Ajax rear'd his shield Covered with seven bull-hides, and Nereid-born The proud Æmonian shook Aetion's towers, Thy fears, even then, I might, in jest, rebuke. On me no prowess have the Gods bestow'd? No Venus, no Apollo, favoured me!” Her failing spirits with derisive glee And fondness he refresht: her anxious thoughts Followed, and upon Corythos they dwelt. Often he met her eyes, nor shun'd they his, For, royal as she was and born of Zeus, She was compassionate, and bow'd her head To share her smiles and griefs with those below. All in her sight were level, for she stood High above all within the seagirt world. At last she questioned Corythos what brought His early footsteps thro' such dangerous ways, And from abode so peaceable and safe. At once he told her why he came: she held Her hand to Corythos: he stood ashamed Not to have hated her: he lookt, he sigh'd, He hung upon her words . . what gentle words! How chaste her countenance. “What open brows The brave and beauteous ever have!” thought she, “But even the hardiest, when above their heads Death is impending, shudder at the sight Of barrows on the sands and bones exposed And whitening in the wind, and cypresses From Ida waiting for dissever'd friends.” CORYTHOS. (SECOND PART.) Helena long had pondered, at what hour To charm her Paris with the novel sight Of such a son, so like him. Seldom bears A beauteous mother beauteous progeny, Nor fathers often see such semblances As Corythos to his. To mortal man Rarely the Gods grant the same blessing twice; They smile at incense, nor give ear to prayer. With this regretful thought her mind recurs To one so infantine, one left behind At morning, from the breast she just had warm'd. “Will no one ever tell me what thou art, Hermionè! how grows thy destined spouse Orestes.” Now invade her other cares How to retain her Paris . . oft she wisht She had a boy like Corythos . . at least Hers she would make him by all tenderness, Atoning, if atonement there could be, For what his mother by her crime sustain'd . . But was it not decreed so from above? She argued . . and remorse was thus appeas'd. Then Agelaos call'd she, and besought. “Perform, O Agelaos, my request. Two youths have been entrusted to thy care, Paris and Corythos: one care is mine. Already hast thou seen the torch extinct That threatened Troy, and strong as be thy wish Again to press thy earlier pupil's hand, Be not thou overhasty: let a son Receive a father's blessing quite alone.” Then he. “Not different were the wise commands His mother gave me. Should I see the man I left a child, he might not recognize Old Agelaos in these wrinkled cheeks, These temples sprinkled now with hoary hair, These limbs now slow, this voice and spirit weak; Nor haply would the prince be overjoyed To know his servant had outrun his lord In virtue's path: my help the royal heir Wants not; but Corythos may want it, him Never until death parts us will I leave.” Revolving in her mind a thousand schemes, She now decided that her guest should come Before his father when the harp and wine Open the breast, and the first lamps were lit To show the dauntless, unsuspicious youth; She oftentimes had thought of it before, And now the day was come. The Trojans turn'd Again to strains of intermitted glee, Not unafraid, however, of reproof Tho' mild; the times had so debased the lyre, And for heroic deeds of better men, It tinkled now, in city and in camp, With little else than weak lasciviousness, Until its strings were stifled with applause. Helena heard not such complacently; Adultress as she was, she had not lost The early bloom of Spartan modesty. Around the chamber shone the images Of boys and maidens robed in vest succinct, And holding burnisht lamps, whence incense wreath'd Its heavy cloud whitened with cedar oil, And under them the purple seats gleam'd forth, And over was the residence of Gods, And nectar-bearing youth, in light serene. Helena, now impatient of delay, Looks often out the portal's tissued folds Heavy with fringe of interwoven gold, And often stops when even Paris speaks, Listening, but not to Paris as before, And, once or twice, half springing from her seat. Now enters Corythos: the splendours round Amaze him, and one image strikes him dumb, His lofty sire's: he would advance, but awe Withholds him: he can only fix his gaze On Helena. When Paris first perceives A stranger, of fresh age and ardent mien, Advance, then hesitate, and then retreat Disturb'd and trembling, voiceless, motionless, Nameless, and without call or office there, And when he sees the purple robe he wears, Woven by Helena in former days, Perhaps too for the man she since had loved, A thousand furies rush into his breast, He tears it off, he hurls it on the ground, He strikes with rapid sword, the face, the neck, The bosom, of his child, and with his heel Stamps on the hands in vain to heaven uprais'd, And hears, infuriate wretch! but bubbling blood, And one loud female shriek . . Thy child! thy child! PELEUS AND THETIS. Thetis. O Peleus! whom the Gods have given me For all my happiness on earth, a bliss I thought too great . . Peleus. Why sighest thou? why shed Those tears? why sudden silence? our last tears Should then have fallen when the Fates divided us, Saying, earth is not thine; that he who rules The waters call'd thee. Bitter those that flow Between the loved and loving when they part, And ought to be; woe to the inhuman wretch Who wishes they were not: but such as fall At the returning light of blessed feet Should be refreshing and divine as morn. Thetis. Support me, O support me in thy arms Once more, once only. Lower not thy cheek In sadness; let me look into thine eyes; Tho' the heavens frown on us, they, now serene, Threaten us no fresh sorrow . . us? ah me! The word of Zeus is spoken: our Achilles Discovered, borne away in the Argive ships To Aulis, froward youth! his fearless heart Had bounded faster than those ships to Troy. Ah! surely there are some among the Gods Or Goddesses who might have, knowing all, Forewarn'd thee. Were there neither auguries Nor dreams to shake off thy security, No priest to prophesy, no soothsayer? And yet what pastures are more plentiful Than round Larissa? victims where more stately? Come, touch the altar with me. Pious man, Doth not thy finger even now impress The embers of an incense often burnt For him, for thee? The lowing of the herds Are audible, whose leaders lead them forth For sacrifice from where Apidanos Rises, to where Enipeus widens, lost In the sea-beach: and these may yet avail. Peleus. Alas! alas! priests may foretell calamity But not avert it: all that they can give Are threats and promises and hopes and fears. Despond not, long-lost Thetis! hath no God Now sent thee back to me? why not believe He will preserve our son? which of them all Hath he offended? Thetis. Yet uncertainties, Worse than uncertainties, oppress my heart, And overwhelm me. Peleus. Thetis! in the midst Of all uncertainties some comfort lies, Save those which even perplex the Gods on high And which confound men the most godlike . . love, Despond not so. Long may Achilles live Past our old-age . . ours? had I then forgot, Dazed by thy beauty, thy divinity? Thetis. Immortal is thy love, immutable. Peleus. Time without grief might not have greatly changed me. Thetis. There is a loveliness which wants not youth, And which the Gods may want, and sometimes do. The soft voice of compassion is unheard Above; no shell of ocean is attuned To that voice there; no tear hath ever dropt Upon Olympos. Fondly now as ever Thou lookest, but more pensively; hath grief Done this, and grief alone? tell me at once, Say have no freshly fond anxieties . . Peleus. Smile thus, smile thus anew. Ages shall fly Over my tomb while thou art flourishing In youth eternal, the desire of Gods, The light of Ocean to its lowest deep, The inspirer and sustainer here on earth Of ever-flowing song. Thetis. I bless thy words And in my heart will hold them; Gods who see Within it may desire me, but they know I have loved Peleus. When we were so happy They parted us, and, more unmerciful, Again unite us in eternal woe. Peleus. Powerfuller than the elements their will, And swifter than the light, they may relent, For they are mutable, and thou mayest see Achilles every day and every hour. Thetis. Alas! how few! . . I see him in the dust, In agony, in death, I see his blood Along the flints, his yellow hair I see Darken'd, and flapping a red stream, his hand Unable to remove it from the eyes. I hear his voice . . his voice that calls on me. I could not save him; and he would have left The grots of Nereus, would have left the groves And meadows of Elysium, bent on war. Peleus. Yet Mars may spare him. Troy hath once been won. Thetis. Perish he must, perish at Troy, and now. Peleus. The now of Gods is more than life's duration; Other Gods, other worlds, are form'd within it. If he indeed must perish, and at Troy, His ashes will lie softly upon hers, Thus fall our beauteous boy, thus fall Achilles. Songs such as Keiron's harp could never reach Shall sound his praises, and his spear shall shine Over far lands, when even our Gods are mute. Thetis. Over his head nine years had not yet past When in the halls of Tethys these were words Reiterated oftenest . . O thou brave Golden-hair'd son of Peleus! What a heap Of shells were broken by impatient Nymphs Because of hoarseness rendering them unfit For their high symphonies! and what reproofs Against some Tritons from their brotherhood For breaking by too loud a blast the slumber Of those who, thinking of him, never slept. To me appear'd the first light of his eyes, The dayspring of the world; such eyes were thine At our first meeting on the warm sea-shore. Why should youth linger with me? why not come Age, and then death? The beast of Kalydon Made his impetuous rush against this arm No longer fit for war nor for defence Of thy own people; is the day come too When it no longer can sustain thy Thetis? Protend it not toward the skies, invoke not, Name not, a Deity; I dread them all. No; lift me not above thy head, in vain Reproving them with such an awful look, A look of beauty which they will not pity, And of reproaches which they may not brook. Peleus. Doth not my hand now, Thetis, clasp that foot Which seen the Powers of ocean cease to rage, Indignant when the brood of Æolos Disturbs their rest? If that refreshing breath Which now comes over my unquiet head Be not the breath of immortality, If Zeus hath any thunderbolt for it, Let this, beloved Thetis, be the hour! THE ESPOUSALS OF POLYXENA. “Thy blood, O pious maiden! shall remain In thy own city; and thou shalt survive Its foe who now espouses thee.” The song Of the three Sisters in three voices sang These words, so comforting a mother's heart To her Polyxena; and from the shrine Of Thymbra, from Apollo's mouth the same When she had led her thither. “Future days Of peace and happiness,” said she, “expand Before thee, and thou seest them not, O child! Pious, yet even by that God's voice unmoved. Behold! how bright the sky! how sweet the air Breathes round about us! sweet when we came forth, But how much balmier now! the flowers arise Under the spring's first dust, as if no foot Of foe had trampled them, and sip the dew Joyous as if they felt thy wedding-day. Continuous heaps extend along the plain, Heaps where one briar binds more than one below, Foes lately, now united evermore.” “I see the flowers, I see the sepultures,” Polyxena said sighing, “and I feel The breeze, no balmier than it breath'd before: That tepid moisture which the plants inhale Was theirs; and ah! those flowers were Trojan blood. Not other now shines forth thy light, O sun, Than when the Achaian anchors graspt our strand Amid the clamour of the host, amid Cars rattling on the stony beach, and shields Struck in defiance. Ah! nor otherwise When every God left Hector.” Here she wept, Here wept the mother too. “But why thus break Silence, if only to make way for grief? I had ceast almost so deeply to bemoan My children when Achilles was defence, Not terror, to us all. Canst thou refuse To see the Gods now with him, friends to Troy? King above kings, rich with ancestral stores, And now about to bring all Asia bound Into Mycenai, and, despite of Mars, Polyxena, thee now doth he prefer To all these glories: ere they yet were won, Iphigeneia never had declined His proffer'd hand while yet his shield was white, Nor had the Nereid, she from whom he sprang, Brought the Vulcanian armour he now bears. Him born of Gods and worthy to beget Their semblances, rejectest thou? She shed Her blood upon the altar that thy hand Might rescue Troy. Thou fearest the wild wail Of our Cassandra; if there must be fear, Is not Achilles what thou mightest dread?” Briefly the yielding daughter thus replied. “Whether the Gods command me, as they do, To wed, or whether to be bound a slave, I follow the behest: where no disgrace No hardship is . . but let me weep awhile. I will, O mother! yes, I will obey A parent . . for this also they command, Hoping they may recall or may remit This one decree. Must I be given up To him behind whose wheels my brother's corse Was drag'd along, drag'd while his breast yet heaved And plowed and fill'd the furrow with his blood. Oh! on this very ground our feet now press Plighted are nuptial vows! are Gods invoked! Thanksgivings offered them! Oh! pardon grief That nothing can abate: what can the Gods Do now to lighten it? Ye mouldering heaps Which friendly hands heapt up and covered o'er With turf, not solid yet; where cypresses, Green lately, drop their hard and withered leaves; And ye that cover corses numberless In happier union, ye but separate The resting soul from soul that knows not rest. I gave my promise; thus Apollo will'd; Let then his oracles, by me observ'd, Bring (to me never!) to my country peace.” Hecuba gaspt for breath, tears gushing down, “O my last child! my only hope in life!” Cried she, “unmerited unhoped-for weal Restorest thou: not what thy terror feigns Wilt thou soon find him: his stern heart relents At Priam's sad reverses; he beholds A house the Gods have visited and deign'd To share its hospitality; he looks With pity and with fondness on thy youth And beauty; else he never would hold out His hand in amity, nor blandly take What he could tear away: beside, he fears That thou, beyond the reach of his revenge (Unlike Brisëis whom his sword reclaim'd) Shouldst be by equal lot another's prey. For long ago he saw our certain fate, Deriding the Palladion, nor afraid Of any Gods, when Gods saw Hector fall.” Another, not a happier, morn arose. Under the walls of Dardanos a plain Lies open: it was covered now with crowds Even to the root of Ida, past the banks Of those two stony rivers, since alike Rendered immortal by immortal song. Unwearied, tho' grown hoary under arms, And from the omen fondly hoping peace, Commingled with the Trojans, in the fane Of their Apollo, the Achaians held Stern silence, or in whispers a discourse That varied. Some regretted the delay Of the doom'd city; some dared blame the king, And some Peleides; others muttered words On treachery, then on bribes, and knew the tent That covered them stow'd carefully from sight. Hither came Priam; slower came behind His aged consort, and her sons, not few; Prodigal had the rest been of their blood. The wives of the survivors hither came, All deeply veil'd and all with brow abased. Hither they once had come led joyfully Mid hymenæal song, by hands now cold: Alone at home remain'd, and tried to wear Away with restless spindle the sad hour, Andromache, oft chided by her child. In every street of the wide city, throngs Rusht forth impatiently to see the shields So long opposed to them, and helmets caught Before by glimpses only thro' the dust. Close to the altar of the placid God Polyxena held tightly by the arm Achilles, and scarce knew it; beautiful Above her sister, beautiful almost As Helena herself; so white that brow, So pure the lustre of those gentle eyes. Cassandra suddenly with horrid scream Rushes beyond the congregated host . . All tremble, all are stricken mute, as when Enters some Deity. She speaks, alone, And not her words speaks she, but words compell'd. “Sister, believest thou the Destinies Are friendly to thee? Sister! turn thine eyes Back from this temple, turn them on the walls Poseidon aided by Apollo rais'd. In vain hath Pallas dwelt within . . I see Prodigies, I see arms and flames o'er-ride The ancient towers; Xanthos and Simoeis I see run swifter now with streams of blood, And heroes rising heavily from wounds, And ruin following when the battles cease. O flower! upon what altar art thou laid, Cull'd by Thessalian hand! why, ere the torch Be lighted, flames so the Sigæan shore And Tenedos the level ray prolongs? Fly! let us fly! Citheron calls aloud; Sound the Chaonian towers, resound the horns Of Achelöos, and, high up above, The thunder-rent Keraunian rocks reply. Hearest thou not the marble manger crack Under the monster's jaw? it scales our walls And human voices issue from its bulk? Why then delay? why idle words? Arise My parents! . . turn, ah! turn away the sight From those Bistonian, those betraying realms. Why, Polydoros, callest thou? why waves A barren cornel o'er a recent tomb While the loose pebbles tinkle down the base? Me neither tears nor madness are vouchsafed; Do thou, devoted sister! now thy chains Are taken off that thy pure blood may flow More readily, step back one little step From where thou sittest on the fagot; come And give me, all I hope, one last embrace. Oh spare her thou! And thee too I implore, Pyrrhos! Oh, by the manes of thy sire! Haste forward. She deserves it not, no crime Is hers. This only my last breath implores.” Uttering such words her maidens drew her home. Another noise was heard within the fane. Silent and dark an arrow from across Amid the tumult struck the hero's heel, And, passing thro' and thro', the brazen point Rang on the marble floor. The chiefs around Wonder to see the weapon and small bead Of blood: they seize their spears, and tear away The olive and verbena from their crests And stamp them underfoot: not Priam's voice Was heard, who gathering dust with desperate grasp Strew'd with it his grey hairs; nor was the bride Heeded, tho' sinking as if into death. Achilles neither helpt her nor required Help for himself; aware the day was come, Foretold him: he with failing voice represt The wrath of his compeers, yet strong enough Thus to command. “Lay ye your arms aside; Let not none avenge Achilles but his son. Alkimos and Automedon! detain Within our tent the Myrmidons: my voice They might no longer mind who see me now, Fallen ignobly . . Ajax! Diomed! Leave here a corse not worth a beast alive, Or hide it where no Trojan may rejoice. Ah! must his herds then graze upon my grave! Let not thy tears drop over me, who e'er Thou art upon my left! my eyes of iron See none, see nothing . . take those friendly arms From off my shoulder . . they now weary me And weary you with their too vain support. Not that Larissa in a quiet tomb Holds my brave ancestors grieve I, O Death, Not that my mother will lament my loss, Lone in the bower of Tethys, for a while; I grieve that Troy should ever thus exult Without more slaughter of her faithless race. Open the turf, remove the blackened boughs, And let the urn of Menætiades Take my bones too. Launch from this hateful strand The bark that bore us hither. With the leave Of your Atreides . . send for . . now at play In Phthia, and expecting the return Of playmate . . my own Pyrrhos, my brave boy . . To bring destruction with the Pelian spear. Hear ye my voice? or with its pants and gasps Expires it, and deceives me? I forget . . Such is the mist of mind that hangs on me . . What are the orders I have given, and what My wishes yet unspoken: be not ye Forgetful of me as I am of these; Sure, although Orcos drags my wounded limbs Beneath, the Shades shall know and fear me there. Pyrrhos! my child, my far-off child, farewell! Whose care shall train thy youth? What Cheiron stoop To teach thee wisdom? what parental hands Be loud in the applauses thou shalt win For lyre, for javelin, for Thessalian car Seen above others in the foremost dust.” DEATH OF PARIS AND ŒNONE. Closed had the darkened day of Corythos. When Agelaos heard the first report, Curses he uttered on the stepmother, Fewer on Paris by her spells enthrall'd, For in the man he now but saw the child, Ingenuous, unsuspicious. He resolved To hasten back to Ida, praying death To come and intercept him on the way. What tale to tell Œnone! and what thanks From parent at a prosperous son's return, Anxiously hoped for after many years, Last gift of wife deserted, now deprived Of him whose voice, whose gesture, day and night Brought the beloved betrayer back again Into her closing and unclosing eyes, And sometimes with her child upon the knee Of her who knew him not, nor cared to know. Grief and indignant virtue wrung her breast When she repeated to the fond old man Such intermingled and such transient joys; But when she met him on his sad return Ida was hateful in her eyes, for there Love bore such bitter and such deadly fruit. When Paris knew the truth, on cheek supine And cold a thousand kisses he imprest, Weeping and wailing; he would expiate (If expiation there might ever be) The murderous deed: he built up high a pyre Of fragrant cedar, and in broken voice Call'd on the name, a name he knew so late. “O Corythos! my son! my son!” he cried, And smote his breast and turn'd his eyes away; Grief wrencht him back, grief that impell'd him on, But soon return'd he, resolute to catch The fleeting ashes and o'ertake the winds; So from the brittle brands he swept away The whiter ashes, placed them in their urn, And went back slowly, often went alone In the still night beneath the stars that shed Light on a turf not solid yet, above The priceless treasure there deposited. Achaians, wandering on the shore, observ'd His movements thither, Laertiades, Epeos, and that hero last arrived, Pæantios, catching the cool air with gasps. There rose the foss before them: they advanced From the Sigæan side thro' copse and brake Along the winding dell of darker shade, Awaiting Paris. Under a loose string Rattles a quiver; and invisibly Hath flown an arrow, and a shout succeeds: No voices answer it. One listens, groans, Calls for his foe; but calls not any God's Or any mortal's aid; he raves, and rests Upon his elbow. Back thro' the soft sands They from their ambush hasten, for no shield, No helmet had they taken, no defence. Below his knee the arrow has transfixt The pulp, and hindered all pursuit; in vain Strove he to tear it out; his vigorous arm Could only break the arrow; blood flow'd hot Where he would wrench it. All night thro', he roll'd His heavy eyes; he saw the lamps succeed Each other in the city far below, He saw them in succession dim and die. In the fresh morn, when iron light awakes The gentle cattle from their brief repose, His menials issue thro' the nearer fields And groves adjacent to explore their lord, And lastly (where perchance he might be found) Nearer the pointed barrow of his son. Thither ran forward that true-hearted race Which cheers the early morn, and shakes the frost From stiffened herbs, which lies before the gate Alike of rich and poor, but faithful most To the forsaken and afflicted, came And howl'd and croucht and lickt their master's face, And now unchided mixt their breath with his. When man's last day is come, how clear are all The former ones! Now appear manifest Neglected Gods, now Sparta's Furies rise, Now flames the fatal torch of Hecuba Portended at his birth, but deem'd extinct Until that arrow sped across the tombs Of heroes, by a hand unseen, involves In flame and smoke the loftiest tower of Troy. Such were the thoughts that vanisht like a mist, And thee, Œnone, thee alone he sees, He sees thee under where the grot was strown With the last winter leaves, a couch for each, Sees thee betrotht, deserted, desolate, Childless . . how lately not so! what avail The promises of Gods? false! false as mine! “Seek out, ye trusty men, seek out,” said he, “The Nymph Œnone: tell her that I lie Wounded to death: tell her that I implore Her pardon not her aid.” They, when they reacht High up the hill the woodland's last recess, And saw her habitation, saw the door Closed, and advancing heard deep groans, which brought Even to the sill her favourite doe and stag Springing before them with defiant breasts, They paus'd; they entered; few and slow the words They brought with them, the last they heard him speak. Briefly she answered with her face aside. “I could not save my child; one who could save Would not.” Thick sobs succeeded. 'Twas not long Ere down the narrow and steep path are heard The pebbles rattling under peasants' feet, Whose faces the dense shrubs at every side Smite as they carry on his bier the man Who thinks his journey long; 'twas long to him Wounded so grievously, to him about To close his waning day, before his eyes Might rest on hers and mix with hers his tears. How shall he meet her? Where the rocks were clear Of ivy, more than once the trace is seen Of name or verse, the hunter's idle score Indifferent to pursue the chase; and where There was a leveler and wider track He might remember, if indeed he cared For such remembrances, the scene of games At quoit or cestus closed by dance and feast. He drew both hands before his face, and wept, And those who carried him, and found him faint And weary, placed their burden on the ground, And with averted faces they wept too. Œnone came not out; her feet were fixt Upon the threshold at the opened door, Her head turn'd inward that her tears might fall Unseen by stranger; but not long unseen By Paris: he was in his youth's domains, He view'd his earliest home, his earliest loves, And heard again his earliest sighs, and hers. “After how many and what years!” he cried, “Return I, O Œnone! thus to thee!” She answered not; no anger, no reproach; For, hours before, she prayed the Eumenides That they would, as befits the just, avenge The murder of her Corythos; she prayed That she might never have the power to help The cruel father in the hour of need. A voice now tells her from her inmost heart, Voice never, to the listener, indistinct, It is not granted to so wild a prayer. Weary of light and life, again she prayed. “Grant me, O Zeus! what thou alone canst grant. Is death too great a boon? too much for me, A wretched Nymph, to ask? bestow it now.” When she had spoken, on the left was heard Thunder, and there shone flame from sky serene; Now on her child and father of her child Equally sad and tender were her thoughts; She saw them both in one, and wept the more. Heedless and heartless wretch she call'd herself, But her whole life, now most, those words belied. Paris had heard the words. “Those words were mine Could I have uttered them: wounds make men weak, Shame makes them weaker: neither knowest thou, Pure soul! one fit for immortality! Let us, Œnone, shouldst thou ever die, Be here united, here is room for both . . Both did I say? and not for one beside? Oh! will his ashes ever rest near mine?” To these few words he added these few more. “Restrain, Œnone, those heartrending sobs!” His he could not restrain, nor deeper groans, Yet struggled to console her. “Are not these Our true espousals? Many may have loved But few have died together!” Then she shriekt “Let me die first, O husband! Hear my prayer Tho' the Gods have not heard it! one embrace! Paris is mine at last; eternally Paris is mine. Oh do not thou, my child, Shun or disdain amid the shades below Those who now die, and would have died for thee! The gift of Venus I have often mourn'd, With this one consolation, that my grief Could not increase: such consolation lasts No longer: punishment far less severe Could Heré or could Pallas have decreed Than Venus on this Ida, where she won A prize so fatal, and to more than me.” The maidens of the mountain came and rais'd Her drooping head, and drew from tepid springs The water of her grot, and, from above, Cedar and pine of tender spray, and call'd Her father Cebren: he came forth, and fill'd After due sacrifice the larger space That was remaining of the recent urn. Paris had given his faithful friends command, Whether the Fates might call him soon or late, That, if were found some ashes on his breast, Those to the bones they covered be restored. HOMER, LAERTES, AGATHA. FIRST DAY. Homer. Is this Laertes who embraces me Ere a word spoken? his the hand I grasp? Laertes. Zeus help thee, and restore to thee thy sight, My guest of old! I am of years as many, And of calamities, as thou thyself, I, wretched man! who have outlived my son Odysseus, him thou knewest in this house, A stripling fond of quoits and archery, Thence to be call'd for counsel mid the chiefs Who storm'd that city past the farther sea, Built by two Gods, by more than two defended. Homer. He rests, and to the many toils endur'd There was not added the worse weight of age. Laertes. He would be growing old had he remain'd Until this day, tho' scarcely three-score years Had he completed; old I seem'd to him For youth is fanciful, yet here am I, Stout, a full twenty summers after him: But one of the three sisters snapt that thread Which was the shortest, and my boy went down When no light shines upon the dreary way. Homer. Hither I came to visit thee, and sing His wanderings and his wisdom, tho' my voice Be not the voice it was; yet thoughts come up, And words to thoughts, which others may recite When I am mute, and deaf as in my grave, If any grave in any land be mine. Laertes. Men will contend for it in after times, And cities claim it as the ground whereon A temple stood, and worshippers yet stand. Long hast thou travell'd since we met, and far. Homer. I have seen many cities, and the best And wisest of the men who dwelt therein, The children and their children now adult, Nor childless they. Some have I chided, some Would soothe, who, mounted on the higher sod, Wept as the pebbles tinkled, dropping o'er A form outstretcht below; they would not hear Story of mine, which told them there were fields Fresher, and brighter skies, but slapping me, Cried worse, and ran away. Laertes. Here sits aside thee A child grey-headed who will hear thee out. Here shalt thou arm my son again, in mail No enemy, no time, can strip from him, But first I counsel thee to try the strength Of my old prisoner in the cave below: The wine will sparkle at the sight of thee, If there be any virtue left in it. Bread there is, fitter for young teeth than ours, But wine can soften its obduracy. At hand is honey in the honeycomb, And melon, and those blushing pouting buds That fain would hide them under crisped leaves. Soon the blue dove and particolor'd hen Shall quit the stable-rafter, caught at roost, And goat shall miss her suckling in the morn; Supper will want them ere the day decline. Homer. So be it: I sing best when hearty cheer Refreshes me, and hearty friend beside. Laertes. Voyagers, who have heard thee, carried home Strange stories; whether all be thy device I know not: surely thou hadst been afraid Some God or Goddess would have twicht thine ear. Homer. They often came about me while I slept, And brought me dreams, and never lookt morose. They loved thy son and for his sake loved me. Laertes. Apollo, I well know, was much thy friend. Homer. He never harried me as Marsyas Was harried by him; lest he should, I sang His praise in my best hymn: the Gods love praise. Laertes. I should have thought the Gods would more approve Good works than glossy words, for well they know All we can tell them of themselves or us. Have they enricht thee? for I see thy cloak Is ragged. Homer. Ragged cloak is songster's garb. Laertes. I have two better; one of them for thee. Penelope, who died five years ago, Spun it; her husband wore it only once, And 'twas upon the anniversary Of their espousal. Homer. Wear it I will not, But I will hang it on the brightest nail Of the first temple where Apollo sits, Golden hair'd, in his glory. Laertes. So thou shalt If so it please thee: yet we first will quaff The gifts of Bakkos, for methinks his gifts Are quite as welcome to the sons of song And cheer them oftener. [Agatha enters with a cup of wine.] Maiden! come thou nigh, And seat thee there, and thou shalt hear him sing, After a while, what Gods might listen to: But place that cup upon the board, and wait Until the stranger hath assuaged his thirst, For songmen, grasshoppers, and nightingales Sing cheerily but when the throat is moist. Homer. I sang to maidens in my prime; again, But not before the morrow, will I sing; Let me repose this noontide, since in sooth Wine, a sweet solacer of weariness, Helps to unload the burden. Laertes. Lie then down Along yon mat bestrown with rosemary, Basil, and mint, and thyme. She knows them all And has her names for them, some strange enough. Sound and refreshing then be thy repose! Well may weak mortal seek the balm of sleep When even the Gods require it, when the stars Droop in their courses, and the Sun himself Sinks on the swelling bosom of the sea. Take heed there be no knot on any sprig; After, bring store of rushes and long leaves Of cane sweet-smelling from the inland bank Of yon wide-wandering river over-sea Famed for its swans; then open and take out From the black chest the linen, never used These many years, which thou (or one before) Spreadst for the sun to bleach it; and be sure, Be sure, thou smoothen with both hands his couch Who has the power to make both young and old Live throughout ages. Agatha. And look well through all? Laertes. Aye, and look better than they lookt before. Agatha. I wish he could make me so, and without My going for it anywhere below. I am content to stay in Ithaca, Where the dogs know me, and the ferryman Asks nothing from me, and the rills are full After the rain, and flowers grow everywhere, And bees grudge not their honey, and the grape Grows within reach, and figs, blue, yellow, green, Without my climbing; boys, too, come at call; And, if they hide the ripest, I know where To find it, twist and struggle as they may; Impudent boys! to make me bring it out, Saying I shall not have it if I don't! Laertes. How the child babbles! pardon her! behold Her strength and stature have outgrown her wits! In fourteen years thou thyself wast not wise. Homer. My heart is freshen'd by a fount so pure At its springhead; let it run on in light. Most girls are wing'd with wishes, and can ill Keep on their feet against the early gale That blows impetuous on unguarded breast; But this young maiden, I can prophesy, Will be thy staff when other staff hath fail'd. Agatha. May the Gods grant it! but not grant it yet! Blessings upon thy head! Homer. May they bestow Their choicest upon thine! may they preserve Thy comeliness of virtue many years For him whose hand thy master joins to thine! Agatha. O might I smoothen that mild wrinkled brow With but one kiss! Laertes. Take it. Now leave us, child, And bid our good Metampos to prepare That brazen bath wherein my rampant boy Each morning lay full-length, struggling at first, Then laughing as he splasht the water up Against his mother's face bent over him. Is this the Odysseus first at quoit and bar? Is this the Odysseus call'd to counsel kings, He whose name sounds beyond our narrow sea? Agatha. O how I always love to hear that name! Laertes. But linger not; pursue the task at hand: Bethink thee 'tis for one who has the power To give thee many days beyond old-age. Agatha. O! tell him not to do it if he can: He cannot make youth stay: the swallows come And go, youth goes, but never comes again. Laertes. He can make heroes greater than they were. Agatha. By making them lay by the wicked sword? How I shall love him when he has done that! Laertes. No, but he gives them strength by magic song. Agatha. The strength of constancy to love but one? As did Odysseus while he lived on earth, And when he waited for her in the shades. Laertes. The little jay! go, chatterer. Agatha. (to Homer). Do not think, O stranger, he is wroth; he never is With Agatha, albeit he stamps and frowns And shakes three fingers at her, and forbears To do the like to any one beside. Hark! the brass sounds, the bath is now prepared. Laertes. More than the water shall her hand assuage Thy weary feet, and lead thee back, now late. SECOND DAY. In the Morning. Homer. Whose is the soft and pulpy hand that lies Athwart the ridges of my craggy one Out of the bed? can it be Agatha's? Agatha. I come to bring thee, while yet warm and frothy, A draught of milk. Rise now, rise just half-up, And drink it. Hark! the birds, two at a time, Are singing in the terebinth. Our king Hath taken down his staff and gone afield To see the men begin their daily work. Homer. Go thou to thine: I will arise. How sweet Was that goat's milk! Agatha. We have eleven below, All milchers. Wouldst thou now the tepid bath? Homer. Rather when thou hast laid on the left-hand My sandals within reach; bring colder lymph To freshen more the frame-work of mine eyes, For eyes there are, altho' their orbs be dark. Agatha. 'Tis here; let me apply it. Homer. Bravely done! Why standest thou so still and taciturn? Agatha. The king my master hath forbidden me Ever to ask a question: if I might, And were not disobedience such a sin, I would ask thee, so gentle and so wise, Whether the story of that bad Calypso Can be all true, for it would grieve me sorely To think thou wouldst repeat it were it false, And some ill-natured God (such Gods there are) Would punish thee, already too afflicted. Homer. My child! the Muses sang the tale I told, And they know more about that wanton Nymph Than they have uttered into mortal ear. I do rejoice to find thee fond of truth. Agatha. I was not always truthful. I have smarted For falsehood, under Queen Penelope, When I was little. I should hate to hear More of that wicked creature who detain'd Her lord from her, and tried to win his love. I know 'twas very wrong in me to listen. Homer. A pardonable fault: we wish for listeners Whether we speak or sing, the young and old Alike are weak in this, unwise and wise, Cheerful and sorrowful. Agatha. O! look up yonder! Why dost thou smile? everything makes thee smile At silly Agatha, but why just now? Homer. What was the sight? Agatha. O inconsiderate! O worse than inconsiderate! cruel! cruel! Homer. Tell me, what was it? I can see thro' speech. Agatha. A tawny bird above; he prowls for hours, Sailing on wilful wings that never flag Until they drop headlong to seize the prey. The hinds shout after him and make him soar Eastward: our little birds are safe from kites And idler boys. 'Tis said (can it be true?) In other parts men catch the nightingale To make it food. Homer. Nay, men eat men. Agatha. Ye Gods! But men hurt one another, nightingales Console the weary with unwearied song, Until soft slumber on the couch descends. The king my master and Penelope Forbade the slaughter or captivity Of the poor innocents who trusted them, Nor robbed them even of the tiniest grain. Homer. Generous and tender is thy master's heart, Warm as the summer, open as the sky. Agatha. How true! how I do love thee for these words! Stranger, didst thou not hear him wail aloud, Groan after groan, broken, but ill supprest, When thou recitedst in that plaintive tone How Anticleia met her son again Amid the shades below? Thou shouldst have stopt Before that tale was told by thee; that one At least was true, if none were true before. In vain, O how in vain, I smote my breast To keep more quiet what would beat within! Never were words so sweet, so sad, as those. I sobb'd apart, I could not check my tears: Laertes too, tho' stronger, could not his, They glistened in their channels and would run, Nor could he stop them with both hands: he heard My sobs, and call'd me little fool for them; Then did he catch and hold me to his bosom, And bid me never do the like again. Homer. The rains in their due season will descend, And so will tears; they sink into the heart To soften, not to hurt it. The best men Have most to weep for, whether foreign lands Receive them (or still worse!) a home estranged. Agatha. Listen. I hear the merry yelp of dogs, And now the ferul'd staff drops in the hall, And now the master's short and hurried step Advances: here he is: turn round, turn round. Laertes. Hast thou slept well, Mæonides? Homer. I slept Three hours ere sunrise, 'tis my wont, at night I lie awake for nearly twice as long. Laertes. Ay; singing birds wake early, shake their plumes, And carol ere they feed. Sound was thy sleep? Homer. I felt again, but felt it undisturb'd, The pelting of the little curly waves, The slow and heavy stretch of rising billows, And the rapidity of their descent. I thought I heard a Triton's shell, a song Of sylvian Nymph, and laughter from behind Trees not too close for voices to come thro', Or beauty, if Nymph will'd it, to be seen; And then a graver and a grander sound Came from the sky, and last a long applause. Laertes. Marvellous things are dreams! methinks we live An age in one of them, we traverse lands A lifetime could not reach, bring from the grave Inhabitants who never met before, And vow we will not leave an absent friend We long have left, and who leaves us ere morn. Homer. Dreams are among the blessings Heaven bestows On weary mortals; nor are they least Altho' they disappoint us and are gone When we awake! 'Tis pleasant to have caught The clap of hands below us from the many, Amid the kisses of the envious few. There is a pride thou knowest not, Laertes, In carrying the best strung and loudest harp. Laertes. Apollo, who deprived thee of thy light When youth was fresh and nature bloom'd around, Bestowed on thee gifts never dim with age, And rarely granted to impatient youth. The crown thou wearest reddens not the brow Of him who wears it worthily; but some Are snatcht by violence, some purloin'd by fraud, Some dripping blood, not by the Gods unseen. To thee, O wise Mæonides, to thee Worthless is all that glitters and attracts The buzzing insects of a summer hour. The Gods have given thee what themselves enjoy, And they alone, glory through endless days. The Lydian king Sarpedon never swayed Such sceptre, nor did Glaucos his compeer, Nor Priam. Priam was about my age, He had more sorrows than I ever had; I lost one son, some fifty Priam lost; This is a comfort, I may rub my palms Thinking of this, and bless the Powers above. Homer. One wicked son brought down their vengeance on him, And his wide realms invited numerous foes. Laertes. Alas! alas! are there not cares enow In ruling nearly those five thousand heads, Men, women, children; arbitrating right And wrong, and hearing maids and mothers wail; For flax blown off the cliff when almost bleacht, And curlew tamed in vain and fled away, Albeit one wing was shortened; then approach To royal ear the whisper that the bird Might peradventure have alighted nigh, And hist upon the charcoal, skinn'd and split. Bounteous as are the Gods, where is the wealth To stop these lamentations with a gift Adequate to such losses? words are light, And words come opposite, with heavy groans. Homer. The pastor of the people may keep watch, Yet cares as wakeful creep into the fold. Laertes. Beside these city griefs, what mortal knows The anxieties about my scattered sheep? Some bleating for lost offspring, some for food, Scanty in winter, scantier in the drought Of Sirius; then again the shrubs in spring, Cropt close, ere barely budded, by the goats. Methinks these animals are over-nice About their food, else might they pick sea-weeds, But these forsooth they trample on, nor deign To taste even samphire, which their betters cull. There also are some less solicitudes About those rocks, when plunderers from abroad Would pilfer eggs and nestlings; my own folk Are abstinent, without their king's decree. Homer. To help thee in such troubles, and in worse, Where is thy brave Telemakos? Laertes. That youth Is gone to rule Dulikion, where the soil Tho' fitter than our Ithaca for tilth, Bears only turbulence and idleness. He with his gentle voice and his strong arm, Will bring into due train the restive race. Homer. Few will contend with gentleness and youth, Even of those who strive against the Laws, But some subvert them who could best defend, And in whose hands the Gods have placed the sword. On the mainland there are, unless report Belie them, princes who, possessing realms Wider than sight from mountain-head can reach, Would yet invade a neighbour's stony croft, Pretending danger to their citadels From fishermen ashore, and shepherd boys Who work for daily and but scanty bread, And wax the reeds to pipe at festivals, Where the dogs snarl at them above the bones. Laertes. What! would the cloth'd in purple, as are some, Rip off the selvage from a ragged coat? Accursed be the wretch, and whosoe'er Upholds him, or connives at his misdeeds. Away with thoughts that sadden even this hour! Homer. I would indeed away with 'em, but wrath Rings on the lyre and swells above the song. It shall be heard by those who stand on high, But shall not rouse the lowlier, long opprest, Who might be madden'd at his broken sleep, And wrenching out the timbers of his gate Batter the prince's down. Laertes. Ye Gods forbid! Thou makest the skin creep upon my flesh, Albeit the danger lies from me afar. Now surely this is but a songman's tale, Yet songman never here discourst like thee, Or whispered in low voice what thou hast sung, Striking the lyre so that the strings all trembled. Are people anywhere grown thus unruly? Homer. More are they who would rule than would be ruled, Yet one must govern, else all run astray. The strongest are the calm and equitable, And kings at best are men, nor always that. Laertes. I have known many who have call'd me friend, Yet would not warn me tho' they saw ten skiffs Grating the strand with three score thieves in each. Curse on that chief across the narrow sea, Who drives whole herds and flocks innumerable, And whose huge presses groan with oil and wine Year after year, yet fain would carry off The crying kid, and strangle it for crying. Alas, Mæonides, the weakest find Strength enough to inflict deep injuries. Much I have borne, but 'twas from those below; Thou knowest not the gross indignities From goat-herd and from swine-herd I endur'd When my Odysseus had gone far away; How they consumed my substance, how the proud Divided my fat kine in this my house, And wooed before mine eyes Penelope, Reluctant and absconding till return'd Her lawful lord, true, chaste, as she herself. Homer. I know it, and remotest men shall know. If we must suffer wrong, 'tis from the vile The least intolerable. Laertes. True, my son Avenged me: more than one God aided him, But one above the rest; the Deity Of wisdom, stronger even than him of war, Guided the wanderer back, and gave the arms And will and prowess to subdue our foes, And their own dogs lapt up the lustful blood Of the proud suitors. Sweet, sweet is revenge; Her very shadow, running on before, Quickens our pace until we hold her fast. Homer. Rather would I sit quiet than pursue. Laertes. Now art thou not, from such long talk, athirst? Split this pomegranate then, and stoop the jar. Hold! I can stoop it: take this cup . . 'tis fill'd. Homer. Zeus! God of hospitality! vouchsafe To hear my prayer, as thou hast often done, That, when thy lightnings spring athwart the sea, And when thy thunders shake from brow to base The Acrokerauneans, thy right hand protect This Ithaca, this people, and this king! THIRD DAY. Homer. And now, Mæonides, the sun hath risen These many spans above the awaken'd earth, Sing me that hymn, which thou hast call'd thy best, In glory to the God who gives it light. First I will call the child to hear thee sing, For girls remember well and soon repeat What they have heard of sacred more or less. I must forbear to join in it, although That blessed God hath helpt to rear my grain High as my knee, and made it green and strong. Alas! I cackle when I aim to sing, Which I have sometimes done at festivals, But, ere a word were out, methought I felt A beard of barley sticking in my throat. [Agatha enters. Now, with a trail of honey down the cup (Agatha, drop it in), commence thy chaunt. (About the 500th verse Laertes falls asleep: awakening he finds Agatha in the same state, and chides her.) Hast thou no reverence for a song inspired? Agatha (in a whisper). Hush! O my king and lord, or he may hear. You were asleep the first: I kept my eyes Wide open, opener than they ever were, While I do think I could have counted more Than half a thousand of those words divine, Had both my hands not dropt upon my lap. Laertes. Another time beware of drowsiness When reverend men discourse about the Gods. Now lead him forth into the cooler porch, Entreating him that he will soon renew His praises of Apollo. Agatha. I will bear Your words to him; he might care less for mine, And, sooth to say, I would much rather hear Some other story, where more men than Gods Shine on the field. Laertes. Of men thou know'st enough. Agatha. Too much: then why show Gods almost as bad? They can not be . . least of all Artemis; 'Twas she directed and preserved Odysseus. Laertes. Blessings upon thee! While thou wast a babe He fondled thee, nor saw when thou couldst walk. Few love so early or so long: We say We love the Gods: we lie; the seen alone We love, to those unseen we may be grateful. Agatha. But when they are no more before our eyes . . . Laertes. That never is, altho' earth come between. Perplex not thou thy simple little head With what the wise were wiser to let be. Agatha. I go, and will not be again perplext. [Aside. He has been dozing while we have converst. Mæonides! rise and take this arm To lead thee where is freshness in the porch. My master tells me thou another time Wilt finish that grand hymn about Apollo. Hast thou no shorter one for Artemis? Homer. Such thou shalt have for her, but not to-day. Agatha. O, I can wait, so (I am sure) can she. Homer. Faint are the breezes here, less faint above; Gladly then would I mount that central peak Which overlooks the whole of Ithaca, That peak I well remember I once clomb (What few could do) without the help of beast. Agatha. Here are sure-footed ones, who weed our thistles, And give us milk, grey dappled as the dawn: Their large and placid eyes well know that path, And they will bring us safely to the top And back again, treading more warily Than up the ascent. I will call forth two boys To lead them, without switches in the fist. These two can lift thee up; I at thy side Require no help, and can whisk off the flies. Homer. I know not what impels me to retrace Scenes I can see no more: but so it is Thro' life. If thou art able, lead me forth, And let none follow; we are best alone. Agatha. Come forward ye. Now lift up carefully The noblest guest that ever king received And the Gods favour most. Well done! now rest, Nor sing nor whistle till we all return, And reach the chesnut and enjoy the shade. Homer. (at the summit). I think we must be near the highest point, For now the creatures stop, who struggled hard, And the boys neither cheer 'em, nor upbraid. 'Tis somewhat to have mounted up so high, Profitless as it is, nor without toil. Agatha. Dost thou feel weary? Homer. Short as was the way It shook my aged bones at every step; My shoulders ache, my head whirls round and round. Agatha. Lean on my shoulder, place thy head on mine, 'Tis low enough. What were those words? . . I heard Imperfectly . . . shame on me! Dost thou smile? Homer. Child! hast thou ever seen an old man die? Agatha. The Gods defend me from so sad a sight! Homer. Sad if he die in agony, but blest If friend be nigh him, only one true friend. Agatha. Tho' most of thine be absent, one remains; Is not Laertes worthy of the name? Homer. And Agatha, who tends me to the last. Agatha. I will, I will indeed, when comes that hour. Homer. That hour is come. Let me lay down my head On the cool turf; there I am sure to rest.

Impossible . . . 'tis death . . . 'tis death indeed . . . Then, O ye Gods of heaven! who would not die, If thus to rest eternal, he descend? O, my dear lord! how shall I comfort thee? How look into thy face and tell my tale, And kneeling clasp thy knee? to be repulst Were hard, but harder to behold thy grief.</field>
