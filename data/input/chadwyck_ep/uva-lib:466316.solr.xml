      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I THE DEATH OF SIR JOHN FRANKLIN ‘The unfriendly elements Forgot thee utterly— Where, for a monument upon thy bones, And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse; Lying with simple shells.’ —Pericles [III. i.]. I As one who having dreamed all night of death Puts out a hand to feel the sleeping face Next his, and wonders that the lips have breath— So we, for years not touching on their trace, Marvelled at news of those we counted dead, ‘For now the strong snows in some iron place Have covered them; their end shall not be said Till all the hidden parts of time be plain And all the writing of all years be read.’ So men spake sadly; and their speech was vain, For here the end stands clear, and men at ease May gather the sharp fruit of that past pain Out in some barren creek of the cold seas Where the slow shapes of the grey water-weed Freeze midway as the languid inlets freeze. II This is the end. There is no nobler word In the large writing and scored marge of time Than such endurance is. Ear hath not heard Nor hath eye seen in the world's bounded clime The patience of their life, as the sharp years And the slow months wrought out their rounded rhyme No man made count of those keen hopes and fears Which were such labour to them, it may be; That strong sweet will whereto pain ministers And sharpest time doth service patiently. Wrought without praise or failed without a name, Those gulfs and inlets of the channelled sea Hide half the witness that should fill with fame Our common air in England, and the breath That speech of them should kindle to keen flame Flags in the midway record of their death. III Is this the end? is praise so light a thing As rumour unto rumour tendereth And time wears out of care and thanks-giving? Then praise and shame have narrow difference, If either fly with so displumèd wing That chance and time and this imprisoned sense Can maim or measure the spanned flight of it By the ruled blanks of their experience, Then only Fortune hath the scroll and writ Of all good deeds our memory lives upon; And the slack judgment of her barren wit Appoints the award of all things that are done. IV The perfect choice and rarest of all good Abides not in broad air or public sun; Being spoken of, it is not understood; Being shown, it has no beauty to be loved; And the slow pulse of each man's daily blood For joy thereat is not more quickly moved; Itself has knowledge of itself, and is By its own witness measured and approved; Yea, even well pleasèd to be otherwise; Nor wear the raiment of a good repute Nor have the record of large memories. Close leaves combine above the covered fruit; Earth, that gives much, holds back her costliest; And in blind night sap comes into the root; Things known are good but hidden things are best. Therefore, albeit we know good deeds of these, Let no man deem he knows their worthiest. He who hath found the measure of the seas, And the wind's ways hath ruled and limited, And knows the print of their wild passages, The same may speak the praise of these men dead. And having heard him we may surely know There is no more to say than he hath said And as his witness is the thing was so. V What praise shall England give these men her friends? For while the bays and the large channels flow In the broad sea between the iron ends Of the poised world where no safe sail may be, And for white miles the hard ice never blends With the chill washing edges of dull sea— And while to praise her green and girdled land Shall be the same as to praise Liberty— So long the record of these men shall stand, Because they chose not life but rather death, Each side being weighed with a most equal hand, Because the gift they had of English breath They did give back to England for her sake Like those dead seamen of Elizabeth And those who wrought with Nelson or with Blake To do great England service their lives long— High honour shall they have; their deeds shall make Their spoken names sound sweeter than all song. This England hath not made a better man, More steadfast, or more wholly pure of wrong Since the large book of English praise began. For out of his great heart and reverence, And finding love too large for life to span, He gave up life, that she might gather thence The increase of the seasons and their praise. Therefore his name shall be her evidence, And wheresoever tongue or thought gainsays Our land the witness of her ancient worth, She may make answer to the later days That she was chosen also for this birth, And take all honour to herself and laud, Because such men are made out of her earth. Yea, wheresoever her report is broad, This new thing also shall be said of her That hearing it, hate may not stand unawed— That Franklin was her friend and minister; So shall the alien tongue forego its blame, And for his love shall hold her lovelier And for his worth more worthy; so his fame Shall be the shield and strength of her defence, Since where he was can be not any shame. VI These things that are and shall abide from hence It may be that he sees them now, being dead. And it may be that when the smitten sense Began to pause, and pain was quieted, And labour almost kissed the lips of peace, And sound and sight of usual things had fled From the most patient face of his decease, He saw them also then; we cannot say; But surely when the painèd breath found ease And put the heaviness of life away, Such things as these were not estranged from him; The soul, grown too rebellious to stay This shameful body where all things are dim, Abode awhile in them and was made glad In its blind pause upon the middle rim Between the new life and the life it had, This noble England that must hold him dear Always, and always in his name keep sad Her histories, and embalm with costly fear And with rare hope and with a royal pride Her memories of him that honoured her, Was this not worth the pain wherein he died? And in that lordly praise and large account Was not his ample spirit satisfied? He who slakes thirst at some uncleaner fount Shall thirst again; but he shall win full ease Who finds pure wells far up the painful mount. VII For the laborious time went hard with these Among the thousand colours and gaunt shapes Of the strong ice cloven with breach of seas, Where the waste sullen shadow of steep capes Narrows across the cloudy-coloured brine And by strong jets the angered foam escapes, And a sad touch of sun scores the sea-line Right at the middle motion of the noon And then fades sharply back, and the cliffs shine Fierce with keen snows against a kindled moon In the hard purple of the bitter sky, And thro' some rift as tho' an axe had hewn Two spars of crag athwart alternately Flares the loose light of that large Boreal day Down half the sudden heaven, and with a cry Sick sleep is shaken from the soul away, And men leap up to see and have delight For the sharp flame and strength of its white ray From east to west burning upon the night; And cliff and berg take fire from it, and stand Like things distinct in customary sight, And all the northern foam and frost, and all The wild ice lying large to either hand; And like the broken stones of some strange wall Built to be girdle to the utmost earth, Brow-bound with snows and made imperial, Lean crags with coloured ice for crown and girth Stand midway with those iron seas in face Far up the straitened shallows of the firth. VIII So winter-bound in such disastrous place, Doubtless the time seemed heavier and more hard Than elsewhere in all scope and range of space; Doubtless the backward thought and broad regard Was bitter to their souls, remembering How in soft England the warm lands were starred With gracious flowers in the green front of spring, And all the branches' tender over-growth, Where the quick birds took sudden heart to sing; And how the meadows in their sweet May sloth Grew thick with grass as soft as song or sleep; So, looking back, their hearts grew sere and loath And their chafed pulses felt the blood to creep More vexed and painfully; yea, and this too Possessed perchance their eyes with thirst to weep More than green fields or the May weather's blue— Mere recollection of all dearer things. Slight words they used to say, slight work to do, When every day was more than many springs, And the strong April moved at heart, and made Sweet mock at fortune and the seat of kings; The naked sea and the bare lengths of land And all the years that fade and grow and fade Were pleasant years for them to live upon, And time's gold raiment was not rent nor frayed; But now they know not if such things be done, Nor how the old ways and old places fare, Nor whether there be change in the glad sun, Defect and loss in all the fragrant air; New feet are in the waymarks of their feet; The bitter savour of remembered sweet No doubt did touch their lips in some sharp guise; No doubt the pain of thought and fever-heat Put passion in the patience of their eyes— IX Yet in the edge and keenest nerve of pain For such no comfort ever wholly dies, And as hurt patience healed and grew again, This knowledge came, that neither land nor life Nor all soft things whereof the will is fain Nor love of friends nor wedded faith of wife Nor all of these nor any among these Make a man's best, but rather loss and strife, Failure, endurance, and high scorn of ease; Love strong as death and valour strong as love, Therefore among the winter-wasted seas, No flaw being found upon them to reprove,— These whom God's grace, calling them one by one, In unknown ways did patiently remove To have new heaven and earth, new air and sun,— These chose the best; therefore their name shall be Part of all noble things that shall be done, Part of the royal record of the sea. QUEEN YSEULT Canto 1 Of the birth of Sir Tristram, and how he voyaged into Ireland In the noble days were shown Deeds of good knights many one, Many worthy wars were done. It was time of scath and scorn When at breaking of the morn Tristram the good knight was born. He was fair and well to see As his mother's child might be: Many happy wars had he; Slew Moronde the knight alone, Whence was all the ill begun That on Blancheflour was done. For long since Queen Blancheflour Took a knight to paramour, Who had served her well of yore. And across the waters dim And by many a river's rim Went Queen Blancheflour with him. Many a bitter path she went, Many a stone her feet had rent, But her heart was well content. ‘Lo!’ she said, ‘I lady free Took this man for lord of me Where the crowned saints might see. ‘And I will not bid him go, Not for joyance nor for woe, Till my very love he know.’ When he kissed her as they went, All her heart was well content, For the love that she him meant. Now this knight was called Roland, And he had within his hand Ermonie the happy land. So five months in Ermonie Dwelt they in their pleasure free; For they knew not what should be. Then came Moronde with his men, Warring with her lord again. All her heart was bitter then. But she said: ‘If this be so, Tho' I die, he shall not know.’ And she kissed and bade him go; And he wept and went from her. Then was all the land astir With a trouble in the air. When Roland the knight was gone, Praise of men his warriors won Warring well before the sun. But Moronde the evil knight Smote him falsely in the fight, Slew him basely out of sight. Then was weeping long and sore: For the great love they him bore All men wept but Blancheflour. But she took her golden ring And a fair sword of the king Wrought with many a carven thing. With no crown about her head, Thinking wild thoughts of the dead, Evermore she fled and fled. Far within the forest fair, A great anguish came on her Till a strong manchild she bare. And she fain had suckled him, There beneath the lindens dim, Round a fountain's weedy brim. But too soon came death to take All her beauty for his sake; And ere death she moaned and spake. ‘Ah, fair child,’ the lady said, ‘For this anguish that it had All thy mother's heart is dead. ‘Sweet, I would not live to see Any sorrow rest on thee, Better thou hadst died with me. ‘Only thou art still too fair For that smile I cannot bear In such eyes as Roland's were. ‘Now, fair child, mine own wert thou (And she kissed the small soft brow) But for death that takes me now. ‘And a bitter birth is thine; But no man can stain thy line With a shame that was not mine. ‘Thou art pure and princely born; Fairer name was never worn, Past the touch of any scorn. ‘Now thy grief has come on me, As I prayed that it might be Lest some woe should rest on thee.’ Wept the low voice musical; ‘Now that mine has given thee all, Better love thy love befall. ‘Purer prayers be round thy sleep, Truer tears than these that drip On thy tender cheek and lip. ‘Now, dear child, of all on earth Thou art yet the fairest birth For the pain thy life was worth. ‘Sweetest name and sweetest heart, Now I see thee as thou art I have had the better part. ‘For the grief my love has had, May the sweet saints keep thee glad Tho' thy birth were strange and sad. ‘Now, dear child’ (her thin voice strove Thro' the drawn dry sobs to move), ‘Leave I thee to Christ's own love.’ So she died in that dark place, With the anguish in her face; Mary took her into grace. On the robe was sown her name, Where a fine thread white as flame Thro' the coloured samite came. For on skirt and hem between Wrought she letters white and green ‘This is Blancheflour the Queen.’ There men found her as they sped, Very beautiful and dead, In the lilies white and red. And beside her lying there, Found a manchild strong and fair Lain among the lilies bare. And they thought it were ill fate, If the child, for fear or hate, They should leave in evil state. So they took him lying there, Playing with the lady's hair, For his face was very fair. And so tenderly he played, Half asmile and half afraid, With her lips and hair, I said, That the strong men for his sake Could have wept for dear heartache At the murmurs he did make. And the strongest lightly stept Forth to where the mother slept; Stooping over her, he wept. Lightly bowed above the child The large face whose might was mild With black-bearded lips that smiled. Then he took it of his grace, Bowed him where she lay in place, Put to hers the little face. Then they softly buried her Where the greenest leaves did stir, With some white flowers in her hair. And for the sweet look he had, Weeping not but very sad, Tristram by his name they bade. ‘For he looks upon her so, Pity where he should not grow All the piteous thing to know.’ And they took the sword and ring That were of Roland the king, Wrought with many a carven thing. So they bred him as they knew; And a noble child he grew, Like a tree in sun and dew. Ere he was ten summers old All the sorrow they him told, Showed the sword and ring of gold. Kissed the boy both sword and ring; ‘As my father was a king, I will wreak this bitter thing.’ Kissed the boy both ring and sword; ‘As my mother to her lord, Fast I cling to this my word.’ So he grew in might and grace, With her look about his face: All men saw his royal race. But when twenty years were done At the rising of the sun Tristram from his place was gone. Forth with warriors is he bound Over many a change of ground, To have wreak of Sir Moronde. When he came to Ermonie, Bare upon the earth bowed he, Kissed the earth with kisses three. To the city men him bring, Where the herald stood to sing ‘Largesse of Moronde the king!’ To the king came Tristram then, To Moronde the evil man, Treading softly as he can. Spake he loftily in place: A great light was on his face: ‘Listen, king, of thy free grace. ‘I am Tristram, Roland's son; By thy might my lands were won, All my lovers were undone. ‘Died by thee Queen Blancheflour, Mother mine in bitter hour, That was white as any flower. ‘Tho' they died not well aright, Yet, for thou art belted knight, King Moronde, I bid thee fight.’ A great laughter laughed they all, Drinking wine about the hall, Standing by the outer wall. But the pale king leapt apace, Caught his staff that lay in place And smote Tristram on the face. Tristram stood back paces two, All his face was reddened so Round the deep mark of the blow. Large and bright the king's eyes grew: As knight Roland's sword he drew, Fiercely like a pard he flew. And above the staring eyes Smote Moronde the king flatwise, That men saw the dear blood rise. At the second time he smote, All the carven blade, I wot, With the blood was blurred and hot. At the third stroke that he gave, Deep the carven steel he drave, Thro' King Moronde's heart it clave. Well I ween his wound was great As he sank across the seat, Slain for Blancheflour the sweet. Then spake Tristram, praising God; In his father's place he stood Wiping clean the smears of blood, That the sword, while he did pray, At the throne's foot he might lay; Christ save all good knights, I say. Then spake all men in his praise, Speaking words of the old days, Sweeter words than sweetest lays. Said one, ‘Lo the dead queen's hair And her brows so straight and fair; So the lips of Roland were.’ For all praised him as he stood, That such things none other could Than the son of kingly blood. Round he looked with quiet eyes; ‘When ye saw King Moronde rise, None beheld me on this wise.’ At such words as he did say, Bare an old man knelt to pray; ‘Christ be with us all to-day. ‘This is Tristram the good lord; Knightly hath he held his word, Warring with his father's sword.’ Then one brought the diadem, Clear and golden like pure flame; And his thanks did grace to them. Next in courteous wise he bade That fair honour should be had Of the dear queen that was dead. So in her great sorrow's praise A fair tomb he bade them raise For a wonder to the days. And between its roof and floor Wrote he two words and no more, Wrote Roland and Blancheflour. That was carven sharp in gold, For a great praise to behold, Where the queen lay straight and cold, All was graven deep and fine, In and out, and line with line, That all men might see it shine. So far off it sprang and shone, Ere ten paces one had gone, Showing all the sorrow done. And the pillars, that upbore The large roof for evermore, In wrought flowers her sweet name wore: Points of stone carved gently all, Wrought in cusp and capital, Climbing still to creep and fall. And in many a tender nook, Traced soft as running brook, Shone her face's quiet look. And above they wrought to lie King Roland all white on high, With the lady carven by. Very patient was her face, Stooping from its maiden place Into strange new mother-grace. Parted lips and closing eyes, All the quiet of the skies Fills her beauty where she lies. On her hair the forest crown Lets the sliding tresses down, Touched ere dark with golden brown; Both with carven hands uplift, Praying softly as at shrift, So it stood a kingly gift. And when all was graven fair Tristram came, and standing there Kissed his mother's tender hair. Then he bade them take for King His true father in each thing, Him who saved the sword and ring. So they hearkened to his word, And they took to be their lord Him who kept the ring and sword. Then by many painful ways, With a noble thought in chase, Tristram journeyed many days. Towards the Cornwall king he bore, Since an oath of love he swore For the name of Blancheflour, That King Mark, her brother true, He would honour as he knew; This was he I tell to you. When he stood in Cornwall there, Mark beheld him standing bare, And he knew his sister's hair. All these things to Mark he told, To the king so lean and cold, And he showed her ring of gold. Then wept all the valiant men, Wept King Mark upon him then, Thinking what a grief had been. Then was Tristram belted knight, For his happy hand in fight. Then spake Mark in all men's sight: ‘For the love my sister won, I will honour as I can This her son, the loved man. ‘And this praise I give him here: He shall go to bring anear My new bride with noble cheer. ‘For strange things are said in place Of the wonder of her face And her tender woman's grace.’ Spake the king so lean and cold: ‘She hath name of honour old, Yseult queen, the hair of gold. ‘All her limbs are fair and strong, And her face is straight and long, And her talk is as a song. ‘And faint lines of colour stripe (As spilt wine that one should wipe) All her golden hair corn-ripe; ‘Drawn like red gold ears that stand In the yellow summer land; Arrow-straight her perfect hand, ‘And her eyes like river-lakes Where a gloomy glory shakes Which the happy sunset makes. ‘Her shall Tristram go to bring, With a gift of some rich thing Fit to free a prisoned king.’ As Sir Mark said, it was done; And ere set the morrow's sun, Tristram the good knight was gone. Forth to Ireland bade he come, Forth across the grey sea-foam, All to bring Queen Yseult home. Canto 2 Of Queen Yseult, and of the voyage to Cornwall Day by day and year by year In the quiet chambers here Grew the lady white and dear. Day by day and week by week Grew the glory of her cheek Till it seemed to breathe and speak. Day by day and night by night Grew she in her mother's sight, Maiden Yseult dear and white. Ever as her face grew fair In a light of growing hair Grew the tresses bright and bare. For no crown the maiden had, But with tresses golden-glad Was her perfect body clad. And no gems the maiden wore But the bright hair evermore All her warm white limbs before. Ah, dear saints, to see her face Many would have died in place, She was wonderful for grace. Wept for love her mother fair, Wept for utter love of her, Kissing soft her maiden hair. Many maidens have men seen, But on earth has never been Any maiden like the queen. So did all her love endure In a life most sweet and sure, Very beautiful and pure. For her mother and the king Sang she many a maiden thing, Standing at their feet to sing. Unto her came Tristram then, Sailing straight with many men For King Mark her love to win. And most royal gifts he bare, Robes for any queen to wear, And great jewels for her hair. And he brought a royal ring Such as noble knight should bring, Wedding her for Mark the king. Very courteously he spake, That for holy honour's sake Maiden Yseult should him take. So the king bade send for her; And she came before them there, Clothed upon with golden hair. And Sir Tristram for her sight Praisèd all the saints aright As men would for happy fight. And he would have died in place But for love and knightly grace That he saw that maiden face. And he knelt with heart aflame, Took her robe in sight of them, Kissed the skirt and kissed the hem. Ah, dear saints, how well it were, Thought he, to die knightly there For that lady's golden hair. And he thought it very good He should perish where she stood Crowned upon with maidenhood. And his whole heart for her sake With a large delight did ache Till it seemed to burn and break. And he thought it well and meet, Lain before that lady sweet, To be trodden by her feet. And so loved he her least tress, That his heart strange thoughts did bless Of its deep unworthiness. For no nearer would he be Her he lovèd loyally With a bright humility. And he thought him, loving her, Of sweet words he used to hear, Lancelot and Guinevere. And what love some men might see, So in under-breath spake he, ‘Now I know what things they be.’ Then the king spake gravely all, And his large voice in the hall Ever seemed to grow and fall. Then the queen spake softlier, And it seemèd him to bear A new trouble in the air. Answered Yseult maidenwise; Great hot tears grew thro' his eyes, That he could not speak or rise. Knowing not what words she said Seemed to beat upon his head Noise that vex't him, being dead. But he spake in courteous wise So that all the knights did rise With a light in their grave eyes. And the king with straight grey hairs Laid Sir Tristram's hand in hers As the bridal manner bears. And her mother that had skill In all herbs that sain or heal Arrow-wound or fever ill, Gave a secret drink of might That she bade her maiden bright Drink upon the bridal night. ‘For it is a mighty thing, And great love to both shall bring If thou drink with Mark the king.’ So was Yseult brought to ship, There she kissed her mother's lip And sat softly down to weep. Forth to Cornwall back they come, Over all the grey salt foam Brought they maiden Yseult home. So came Yseult from her own; Wept the grave king on his throne, And her mother wept alone. Now the days grew bright and long, And her voice the men among Warmed their spirits like a song. And the men at oar that rowed, Seeing Yseult where she trode For her dear face praisèd God. For they said, ‘Was never man Since the world's great hap began Such a lady to him wan.’ So they spake between their oars, Rowing level by green shores, Sloped about with great grey moors. And when days were full of spring Tristram prayed her well to sing In their ears some happy thing. So the lady sang to them, And all faces grew aflame, And on all great glory came. So the lady sang alway, And the men rose up to pray, For her face shone bright as day. So her song the lady kept, And their souls to Godwards leapt, And with pride the meanest wept. When Queen Yseult's song had end, All they bowed with head and hand, Speaking soft in whispers bland. But with all the summer heat That about them burned and beat Sore athirst was Yseult sweet. For she sang so loud and long To the rowers rowing strong That she thirsted in her song. Then bade Tristram bring her wine In her chalice carven fine, Rich with many a tender line. So the chaliced wine was brought, And the drink of power that wrought Change in face and change in thought. And the wine was fierce and sweet, But the lady, drinking it, Shuddered to her hands and feet. But the drink her mother gave In the carven chalice brave Like warm gold did float and wave. And Sir Tristram, courteous-wise, With a smile about his eyes Pledged the queen in knightly guise. As they drank in love and truth, Lo, there grew in heart and mouth As a hot and bitter drouth. Then he bent towards her there, And he knew that she was fair, And he stooped and kissed her hair. And Queen Yseult, painèd sore For the love that him she bore, As she kissed him, trembled more. At their hearts it stirred and crept, Round their hearts it grew and leapt, Till they kissed again and wept. So was their great love begun, Sitting silent in the sun, Such a little thing was done. And Queen Yseult, weeping still, Tristram had to do his will That his list she should fulfil. Tristram had her body fair, And her golden corn-ripe hair, And her golden ring to wear. So he took the golden ring That was of Sir Mark the king, As to serve her in each thing. And his mother's Yseult had To keep wisely as he bade; So they sware it, low and glad. So they slept the night long there, And above their faces bare Flowed and glowed the golden hair. So to Cornwall did they come All across the flowing foam, So was brought Queen Yseult home. So King Mark his bride hath got That he little knew, I wot, When his heart with wine was hot. And men said, ‘Great pity is He such queen should ever kiss, Little were his need, I wis.’ But they knew not what had been, And with smiles and moans between On Sir Tristram looked the Queen. So they brought her by his hold To the king so lean and cold, Yseult queen, the hair of gold. Canto 3 How Sir Tristram and Queen Yseult loved each other by the space of three years All that night and all thro' day Many minstrels bade men play That the king's great praise they say. So they sang in court and hall, But it only grieved them all Such a bride should him befall. For none wist what had been done, Yseult's maidens all but one Said their queen a bride were gone. Many days this love grew old, While abode the hair of gold By the king so lean and cold. And such love their love did bless They had much of happiness And their hope grew never less. And at morning when she leant From her lattice in content Over him her face was bent. And on kingly summer eves When much light is in the leaves, Had they joy of all that lives. Sometimes in the garden place, When much light was in her face, Would he sing of her great grace. So she leant to hear his song, Heard him in the leaves among Singing in the sweet French tongue. ‘This was love that Yseult wan, That to any maid or man Spake she courteous as she can. ‘This was praise that Yseult had, That her happiness made glad Man or maiden that was sad. ‘Now this Yseult ever knew That such love about her grew As kept all men pure like dew. ‘And this Yseult had but one To love well beneath the sun Till her very love were done.’ And he praised her as he can For the love that him began That she loved none other man. And he praised her without fear, Like a songbird singing clear, Lady Yseult white and dear. Singing where he saw her stand, ‘Is none like her in the land, Golden hair and arrow hand.’ And such praises would he sing, Harping high before the king, And of many a happy thing. And men praised him by his name, But her brows were all aflame That she from the banquet came. And she walked alone and said, ‘Of such knight was never read.’ So that summer they were glad. But when snows were thick about Yseult sent for Tristram out Soft dry leaves of melilote. That was for a sign to stand That he came to take her hand In the happy garden land. For he sent her words to see, ‘Yseult, of thy courtesy, Have now pity as of me, ‘For my love is barren here.’ To him came an answer clear Of the lady white and dear. So that when his love had got Those dry leaves of melilote, He the pain remembered not. But he saw not where to go, Lest his feet some man should know, For the ways were marred with snow. So his bitter doubt he wrote, And she sent him for his doubt The same leaves of melilote. And he marvelled; but he said, ‘Tho' I die, her rede be read.’ And for help of Love he prayed. And it seemèd well to go By the court where slept he now, Right against her in the snow. And at night she came and spake, ‘Tristram, as for love's true sake, All my pleasure bid me take.’ And he sware her will to do, And she smiled that it was so; ‘I shall hear thee thro' the snow.’ A great wonder took him there, For her face was very fair Under all her gathered hair. And more near and soft she stept, And both arms about him crept, That for bitter love he wept. All his heart was drawn in two That he wist not what to do; And she kissed him, thinking so. Then she raised him tenderly, Bore him lightly as might be, That was wonderful to see. So they passed by trail and track, Slowly, in the night all black, And she bore him on her back. As they twain went on along, Such great love had made her strong, All her heart was full of song. Pausing, she breathed sharply there; And about her, bowed and bare, Flashed and fell the golden hair. Pausing, round her body sweet Rolled the ripe hair to her feet; Forth she bare him as was meet. Thro' the court all white and wide Straight across from side to side Bare she him in patient pride. She was hurt with snow and stone, Came no sob nor any moan That with bare feet had she gone. And when all her pain was great, Smiling in such evil state Did she walk beneath his weight. And his heart yearned sharp for her, And he would not breathe or stir For a pain of bitter fear. Till she stood on the strewn floor Right within the chamber door, With the weight of love she bore. When he stood beside her there Smiling, she drew back the hair From her throat and bosom fair. All her neck was strained and red; Then soft words to him she said, Leaning on his face her head. And his kisses on her hair And her throat and shoulders bare Fierce and bitter kisses were. Then he wept for anger sweet, Flung him down to touch her feet And to kiss them as was meet. And above him while she stood, Stains upon her red as blood; Then she kissed him as he would. So great love that time had they; And would God that I could say All their love by year and day. Now three years this thing had been, And no wrath was them between, For the love he bare the queen. Till a knight they loved of old To Sir Mark this marvel told, To the king so lean and cold. A great shadow took his face, Somewhat low he spake in place And flushed red in little space. Then his hands began to stir, Plucking at his face and hair, Shameful things he spake of her. Sware he by his fathers dead (Then his thin face was not red), ‘She shall bear the steel,’ he said. So he bade to wreak his thought She should bear the white steel hot; But the nobles hearkened not. Then most shameful things he spake That the nobles for his sake Seemèd not their sense to take. And she spake where men might see, ‘Thou, Sir Mark, that shamest me, None I gave my hand but thee. ‘And if other ever were (And a great scorn made her fair) It was he that standeth there.’ Then great laughter laughèd all, For against the outer wall Evil-clad he stood in hall. And the men for very shame Spake her quit of ill defame, And Sir Mark bade praise her name. But for love he bare her so Softly bade she Tristram go; Thence to both was wail and woe. So he went from her apace; And she dwelt by Mark in place With a trouble in her face. Canto 4 How Sir Tristram came to Brittany So much grief for him was made, All the land was changed and sad, But Queen Yseult nothing said. Then came Tristram the good knight From his lady's noble sight, All athirst for toil and fight. So he went by many ways Thro' strange lands by many days, And in wars he won him praise. Then for love of Lancelot And the praise his love had got Came the knight to Camelot. There beheld he Guinevere, All her face like light was clear, That men shook for loving fear. And more smooth than steel or glass All her happy forehead was, Thro' her eyes some dream did pass. And he thought of Yseult now, ‘For this lady's eyes and brow She might stand with her, I trow.’ But the king and Lancelot For the great praise he had got Did him welcome as they mote. So long time he dwelt with them, In his fight was found no blame That he won a noble name. All men for his sake were glad, But in thought he ever had The gold hair that Yseult clad. And he thirsted for one tress, Praising her in humbleness. Men him called of Lyonesse, For that so his birth had been. And when many months were seen Took he farewell of the queen. Farewell of the king he took, And set sail with heavy look, For this time he could not brook. All his heart so weary was And so worn with love, alas! With great love in bitter case, That he thirsted thence to be, So they sailed the blowing sea Till they came to Brittany. He was shent in evil plight, As one soiled with storm and fight, Yet he stood a perfect knight. For his face was fair and strong, And his body straight along, And his deep speech like a song, And his eyes were clear and sad As the bitter love they had, Men for him great marvel made. And they told him how their lord Died in war with hand on sword, Died and held his knightly word. So his daughter had their land, Yseult of the white snow-hand, Pale and still they saw him stand. Then as one in pain he stirred, Speaking low some loving word In a voice that no man heard. And a great smile overtook All the trouble of his look, And he neither breathed nor spoke. When he came by her in place, He beheld her small sweet face And pure eyes of patient grace. All her face was hushed and dim As her courcet's pearlèd rim With a maiden fear of him. And in courteous wise she bade That fair honour should be had Of the knight so pale and sad. So he dwelt beside her long, In his heart he would no wrong, But she drew it like a song; Some dim song at waking heard When the tender gloom is stirr'd With the joy of some sweet bird. So he gladly dwelt by her In the grey great castle there, And she grew a lady fair. And she mused of him alone, Musing when the day was done By the ranges of black stone, Till her eyes grew strange and deep, And it seemed they could not sleep Tho' men saw she did not weep. And all men that saw her loved For her quiet eyes approved All her changes when she moved; And each day by her he came For the love of her sweet name And her love who bare the same. And as days were come and gone, With no laughter and no moan, Love grew up ere doubt was done. Deep in her sweet soul she kept All the tender pain that slept So far down, she never wept. But in all her heart she said, ‘If such care for me he had, Certes I were dear and glad.’ And it fell one gentle day In the greenest week of May, That her sorrow went away. For the day was nearly done, And among the woods alone Was Sir Tristram softly gone. All about the woods were green, Walked he in the leaves between, Thinking sweetly of the queen. What great love he won of her, And he thirsted for her here, Arrow hand and golden hair. Her old praises did he sing, Hidden in the happy spring Sang he many a bitter thing. And the leaves about him shook, For great weeping overtook All his voice and quiet look. And the snow-hand of her grace Sought him in the garden place, With a doubt in her sweet face. And she heard his singing low, Clear glad words she seemed to know, And she loved him, singing so. ‘This was praise that Yseult wan, That to any maid or man Spake she courteous as she can. ‘This was praise that Yseult had, That her happiness made glad Man or maiden that was sad.’ And hereat the sorrow broke Thro' the happy words he spoke, And the quick tears marred his look. But the lady whiter grew, White as fear and pale as dew, So his voice her spirit drew. For she fain would comfort him, And she shook in heart and limb, And her eyes were hot and dim. ‘Ah,’ she said, ‘our love is so That he will not speak of woe, And I dare not come to know. ‘For I would not any change Came to make this old life strange, Or throw love beyond its range. ‘Yet indeed he sang my name.’ And a slow blush overcame Her bowed face with maiden flame. ‘And he spake sweet things of me For pure love and courtesy Where none else had cared to see. ‘I that am but simple maid Shall he give me love,’ she said, ‘With men's praise to crown his head? ‘Yet I ween he sang my name,’ And again the glorious shame All her sweet face overcame. Then he met her, grave and mild, And the maiden lips that smiled Trembled as a chidden child. And his heart went up for her, Till each thought that harboured there Rose as pure as any prayer. And he wist that it were well In her quiet love to dwell; So their marriage-time befell. For in love to her he spake And was troubled for her sake, And the grief her love might make. And in quiet maiden wise, While a light fled thro' her eyes Faster than a shadow flies, Spake she to him, very low, Then a fear did overflow All her heart lest he should know. But the knight her soft love knew, And her spirit sweet and true Where the love lay light as dew. And such grave pure speech he made That to listen bowed her head With still joy of that was said. And the maiden love snow-pure In her heart should well endure, Like a fair tree planted sure. For she loved him as the light, And was fairest in his sight As a lake the noon keeps bright. So their day of love was glad, And his face nor proud nor sad, So his maiden bride he had. And great joy was thro' the land When in love the twain should stand, Tristram and the sweet snow-hand. Then much grief for him was made, All the land was changed and sad, But the cold king's heart was glad. So came Tristram the good knight From his lady's noble sight, All athirst for toil and fight. And great praise he won him there, So that all men spake him fair For the wondrous name he bare. And when Yseult heard them speak Died the pain that kept her weak, Died the sorrow from her cheek. Forth to Camelot he came, Riding silent as in shame Thro' the noises of his fame. When was made his welcome there, He beheld Queen Guinevere, All her face like light was clear. Thro' her eyes a dream did pass, And more smooth than steel or glass All her happy forehead was. So he thought, ‘For eyes and brow She might stand by Yseult now, Yet were mine as fair, I trow.’ All men for his sake were glad, But in thought he ever had The gold hair that Yseult clad. And he thirsted for her eyes As a bird that bleeds and flies For the fountain where it dies. And he yearned to touch her hand, As a river drawn thro' sand Thirsts to reach the smooth green land. And he pined to kiss her mouth, As a rose in dewless drouth For the warm rains of the south. So for thirst of her sweet look And the hair that shone and shook, Night or day he could not brook. Ere a leaf had left its tree, Sailed he all the blowing sea Till he came to Brittany. Canto 5 Of the bridal night of Sir Tristram and the Lady Yseult aux Blanches Mains So at night the maidens came; And they called her by her name, And she followed without shame. And the singing-maidens there Led the bride with tresses bare, Singing bridal songs of her. Purple flowers, blue and red, On the rushes round the bed Strewed they for her feet to tread. But about the bed they set Large white blossoms, white and wet, Crowns the fairest they could get. Her blue robe along the hem Coloured like a lily's stem, She put off and gave to them. And she bade the fairest girl All her soft hair comb and curl With a comb of jet and pearl. By the mirrored steel she stood, Thinking gently as she could Sweet new thoughts of womanhood. In his eyes that she would please Will she seem the queen of these, With the hair swept round her knees? Then the tallest maiden came, Called her softly by her name; And she lay down without shame. Then came Tristram softly in; Long he stood without, I ween, Thinking old thoughts of the queen. Sweet old thoughts he could not say, How in other times he lay By Queen Yseult till the day. Softly to the bed he came; But between the taper's flame A fair face looked out at them. He lay down and dreamed: but she Lay and looked towards the sea; And a bitter dream dreamt he. But he stood away and said: ‘Lo, an evil rede were read If I had her maidenhead. ‘One that I love more than her Dwells across the water fair, Yseult of the golden hair. ‘And for love that she has worn Men will smite her face with scorn, Shame that such a queen were born! ‘Lo, to both much ill were done, For this Yseult, loving one, Loves but him below the sun. ‘And great shame will overtake All her beauty for my sake If her maidenhood I break. ‘And this thing shall never be That for maiden love of me Men should shame her as they see. ‘For some men will say, “Behold, Yseult queen, the hair of gold Was his paramour of old.” ‘And for love I loved before Shall they call her paramour.’ So he musèd long and sore. And the maiden in his sight Lay beside him, very bright, Like a sleeper, straight and white. Then he thought him, lying there, Of Queen Yseult's golden hair And the brows of Guinevere. Spake the snow-hand maidenly, ‘Tristram, for thy courtesy Think thou no scorn to kiss me.’ A great tremble took his heart, Many memories made him start, Listening as he lay apart. Sidelong to him crept she close, Pale as any winter rose When the air is grey with snows. For she heard him start and stir, And drew ever near and near Lest his heart were wrath with her. But his eyes grew very dim, And a tremble went thro' him, Shuddering over heart and limb. For pure love of her he wept As in fear she crept and crept Slowly, lest perchance he slept. Soft as lighteth bird on bough Thrice he kissed her, breathing low, Kissed her mouth and maiden brow. And in under breath said he When his face she could not see, ‘Christ look over her and me.’ Low sweet words of love she said With her face against his head On the pillows of the bed. Then a pleasure bright and mild Smoothed her sweet face, and she smiled, Sleeping as a maiden child. And his hands for love of her From the throat and shoulders bare Parted off the ruffling hair. Then he kissed her hair and head For the sweet words she had said; And in kissing her he prayed. Praying in his heart he spake, That for Mary's maiden sake Christ would keep his faith awake. And the sweet saints knew aright That he bore him well in fight, Warring ever in their sight. And the Mother pitied him, For he shook in heart and limb, Lying in the chamber dim. And he bowed his body fair Down athwart the window there, Weeping for the golden hair. It was wonderful to see That he wept so bitterly With his face to the blown sea. As he turned and softly stept, Lest perchance she had not slept, Bitterly he wept and wept. She lay out before him there, All her body white and bare Overswept with waves of hair. There she rested, breathing low, Purer than the naked snow, Beautiful to see and know. In her sleep she spake and prayed; And for those dear words she said, He came softly to the bed. And in love he would not hide, Praying between pain and pride, Laid him softly at her side. So from evening till the day At her side in love he lay; Slept no child as pure as they. So her love had all it would, All night sleeping as she could, Sleeping in her maidenhood. Canto 6 How Queen Yseult kept her ring Days are come and days are gone Over Cornwall many a one, Since her ordeal was done. Mark was tender with his fear, Lest some worse thing he should hear, And bade all men honour her. So Queen Yseult's days were fair, And her maidens, waiting bare, Combed and crowned the golden hair. But King Mark would keep apart, Lest her eyes should make him start, Full of envy was his heart. And his face grew long and lean And his lips more pale, I ween, Hiding harsh words of the queen. And in bitter speech he said, When much wine had filled his head, A bad prayer that she were dead. So the court began to stir, And the maidens gathered near, Whispered secret things of her. And most bitter pain she had, Painèd thro' her speeches glad, Till her heart grew faint or mad. In the pleasure that she made At the revels the king bade, Wild and wandering words she said. And at night when all the room Spread about her black and dumb, She lay gazing thro' the gloom. All old comfort she forgot, And her throat and lips grew hot, And her large eyes moistened not. Then she thought the grave were cold, And spake soft her name of old, ‘Yseult, queen, the hair of gold.’ And she wept for that one thing, For she looked upon the king, And drew forth her golden ring. Slept King Mark upon the bed, Thick hot wine had filled his head, Some fierce word in sleep he said. She had thought long since to hear Speech of Tristram spoken clear, That his life was kept for her. And when any knight came nigh To her place for courtesy, Saw she Tristram standing by. And when songs of her were sung, Heard his voice the leaves among Singing in the sweet French tongue. And when harpers harped anew, Very pale and faint she grew Like a lily dead in dew. So she held him dead and lain Out beyond the water-plain, Naked under sun and rain. In the dark she rose to weep, ‘Long wet tendrils clasp and creep Where the good knight lies asleep.’ No one heard the words she said On the pillows of the bed, Praise and prayer for Tristram dead. No one saw her girdle slip, Saw her loosen it to weep, Thinking how he touched her lip. Heavily her robe sank white, Heavily her hair sank bright, Rustling down in the dead night. And her breast was loosened so From the hunger of its woe, When the samite rustled low. Clothèd queenlike sate she there, Sate she in the moonlight bare, Golden light and golden hair. To much evil was she brought, Very bitter things she thought Tho' her quiet lips said naught. And the sweet saints pitied her As they saw the weeping hair, And the face so very fair. At her side no queen might stand, Was none like her in the land, Golden hair and arrow hand. Then she prayed, if any heard, And the air about her stirr'd As the motions of a bird. And she thought an angel came, Poised his wings of painted flame, And spoke bitterly her name. For she bowed before his look, And her heart such trembling took, That her limbs with weeping shook. Then she rose and did not pray, Far off sounds she heard at play Blown about a windy bay. Down athwart the window bright Leant she into the dead light, Wept for Tristram the good knight. The deep sky and sharp grey crag, Black with many a jut and jag, The pale stream where stirred the flag, All the long white lines of sea, All the long white slope of lea, In the moonlight watchèd she. Then again she sank to weep, In the rushes rustling deep, Flung a white and golden heap, And she thought, ‘The world is wide, Somewhere I might flee and hide, So the king should ease his pride. ‘And thereafter will he know All the chance of this our woe, And repent him, hearing so. ‘He will say in all men's sight That this Yseult had not right, Who took Tristram for her knight. ‘If King Mark should weep,’ said she, Thinking what a woe might be, ‘Shall not all men pity me? ‘For none ever,’ soft she said, ‘Any truer woman had Than this Tristram that is dead. ‘All things had my lord of me, Love and help and mercy free, And my thought his thought to be.’ So her heart was comforted Of the bitter pain it had, As she lay down on the bed. And the saints sent sleep to her, In the moonlight very fair, Golden light and golden hair. She remembered that old night When across the courts all white Bare she Tristram the good knight. And she smiled with pride anon, As came to her one by one All the mercies she had done. How for very love she bore Things no woman knew before, And would bear for evermore. And a dumb great smile smiled she, And it deepened still to see, Till she laughed low laughters three. And she said, ‘This love put by (In a holy voice and high) Shall not perish tho' I die. ‘And when men shall praise him dead (Both her cheeks flushed royal-red) All my story shall be said. ‘For I shall not blush to know (And she rose up, speaking so) That men speak of this my woe. ‘For that I love Tristram well (And her voice rang like a bell) Is no shame for them to tell. ‘Since indeed no shame it were (Said she, shaking back her hair) That one loved him thrice as fair. ‘For such knight was never seen (Spake most loftily the Queen) Since a noble man has been. ‘For the wars he warred of old (Straight she drew the hair of gold) In all people will be told. ‘So by Tristram the good knight (All her face was full of light) Shall I stand in all men's sight. ‘Hair and eyes and smile and speech (Soft she wove it, plait and pleach) Gave I to Sir Tristram each. ‘Men would praise me oft in place (Wondrous was her lighted face) For my smile and spoken grace. ‘Many singers sang of me (Stately stood she, as a tree) For pure heart and courtesy. ‘Thought and grace and loving heart (She looked up with lips apart) All I gave to be his part. ‘Now there is no more to say (Said she softly as one may) Tho' I die for him ere day.’ And she knew the measures bland, ‘Is none like her in the land, Golden hair and arrow hand.’ All day long the eager light Was a trouble in her sight, And the festal lamps by night. Then the king soft speeches made, Half in hate and half afraid, And she loathed the words he said, Tho' she hearkened not a whit; And a sorrow vexed her wit, Ever turning over it. And her pride was made most weak, And a shadow blind and meek Took her brows and altered cheek. And old thoughts about her came When the dais was all aflame With large lights, each day the same. And she wist not what to say Could not move her lips to pray For the heart that beat alway. And she paused before her glass, For so tight the girdle was By her breast, she could not pass. And she thought, ‘If he should come Back across the grey salt foam I were altered in his doom. ‘Nay,’ she said, ‘for love were there, And the corn-ripe golden hair, Tho' the face should be less fair.’ Then she smiled, and faintlier Came the silken courtly stir; But the king's eyes hated her. And their straight cold look she knew, And again more faint she grew Than a lily dead in dew. So she saw days go and come, And at night in the old room Lay she gazing thro' the gloom. LANCELOT LANCELOT Very long and hot it was, The dry light on the dry grass, The set noon on lakes of glass, All that summer time; And the great woods burnt and brown, With dry tendrils dropping down, And the sky's white rampart thrown On the bare wall of a town, Round breadths of oak and lime. Thro' the woods I rode and rode, No prayer of mine clomb up to God; Sharp leaves crackled on the road Where my horse the heaviest trode, Over leaves and grass. Thro' the sad boughs rent on high Naked burnt the great blind sky; Yet I did not pray to die, For no pain that was. Here and there some colour was Hidden in the muffled grass, Some late flower that one might pass, Or else a brown, smooth beech-mast was, Or carven acorn cup. And birds sang, and could not long, For a trouble in their song: All things there did suffer wrong, All but I who rode along. Now I grow so tired of this, I would give much gold to kiss One leaf of those primroses That grow here when the green spring is Whereof their life is made. Under moon and under star I have ridden fast and far Where the deep leaves thickest are In the huddled shade. I cannot see what I shall do. Now the day drops angrily, Leaves a red stain on the sea, And fierce light on field and tree, Red as any brand. A great slumber takes me round In this place of sleepy sound; Surely now the gift is found And ready to my hand. For there is left me nothing new And none rides with me riding through These brown wood walks so straight and few For many nights and days. And men say that I shall not win, Tho' the chosen for all my sin; The sleepy beams crawl out and in Under the branches rare and thin Where thro' I ride always. (He sleeps.) THE ANGEL Lo, the air begins to move Like a heart that beats with love All about thee and above, For the hope it whispers of But a little while. A great love has healed his heart, The shut eyelids move and start, The shut lips are breathed apart In a sleepy smile. LANCELOT Ah! dear Christ, this thing I see Is too wonderful for me, If I think indeed to be In Thy very grace. Clear flame shivers all about, But the bright ark alters not, Borne upright where angels doubt; The blessed maiden looketh out White, with barèd face and throat Leaned into the dark. On her hair's faint light and shade A large aureole is laid, All about the tresses weighed. THE ANGEL This is what thou wert to find. Lo, the thin flames blown behind Tremble in the blowing wind As loose hair that girls unbind In a woody place. LANCELOT Ah, sweet Lord that art my Lord, Thy light is sharp as any sword; My heart is strainèd as a cord That a child may break. Evenwise each side her head So they stand, the blessed maid, The angels and the ark. It were strange if I should see Sweet new things for love of Thee; For such hope was not to be; Yet hast Thou had ruth on me For my sorrow's sake. I tremble, but I cannot weep, I fear so much I am asleep; Round the faces ranged and steep A thin splendour seems to creep Thro' the night so dear and deep, Seems to stir as leaves that dip In a lilied lake. Ah, sweet Lord that died on rood, Of old time Thy word hath stood And we saw it very good; Yet is this Thy happy blood I was not to see. THE ANGEL Where she standeth in the night Clasped about with solemn light, Clothed upon with samite bright, The blessed maiden very white, This is all the happy sight That I may bring for thee. LANCELOT Over me the glory smites, Sharp and level as the lights Spear-shap'd on solemn winter nights That strike from shade to shade; Only all the inner place (Ah, my Lord, is this Thy grace?) Shineth as a happy face In a clear and golden space That itself hath made. Is this love that I may win, Love of mine for all my sin? The straight flames flicker out and in, Tho' they never fade. But the light of that strange place (Lord, I thank Thee for Thy grace!) Thro' the lights of moving space Trembles like a living face Whereon some pain is laid. THE ANGEL Turn thine eyes against the light, Where the spearèd splendours smite Round the ark, most close and white; This is given me to-night For the love of thee. LANCELOT All the wonder shown above (Lord, I praise Thee for Thy love!) Thro' the lights that mix and move Like blown feathers of a dove Stirreth, strange to see; And midway the solemn place (As my soul were full of grace) Leaning hither, the clear Face Seemeth to bless me. THE ANGEL Points of sharp light star the ground; Thro' the wind is blown a sound As of singing voices round Over the dark land. Christ the Lord is fair and crowned, Whose pure blood, in bitter swound, Droppèd from the holy wound; Surely now the gift is found And ready to thy hand. LANCELOT Lo, between me and the light Grows a shadow on my sight, A soft shade to left and right, Branchèd as a tree. Green the leaves that stir between, And the buds are lithe and green, And against it seems to lean One in stature as the Queen That I prayed to see. Ah, what evil thing is this? For she hath no lips to kiss, And no brows of balm and bliss Bended over me. For between me and the shine Grows a face that is not mine, On each curve and tender line And each tress drawn straight and fine As it used to be. THE ANGEL This is Guenevere the Queen. LANCELOT For the face that comes between Is like one that I have seen In the days that were. Nay, this new thing shall not be. Is it her own face I see Thro' the smooth leaves of the tree, Sad and very fair? All the wonder that I see Fades and flutters over me Till I know not what things be As I seemed to know. But I see so fair she is, I repent me not in this; And to kiss her but one kiss I would count it for my bliss To be troubled so, For she leans against it straight, Leans against it all her weight, All her shapeliness and state; And the apples golden-great Shine about her there. Light creeps round her as she stands, Round her face and round her hands, Fainter light than dying brands When day fills the eastern lands And the moon is low. And her eyes in some old dream Woven thro' with shade and gleam Stare against me till I seem To be hidden in a dream, To be drowned in a deep stream Of her dropping hair. That is Guenevere the Queen. Now I know not what they mean, Those close leaves that grow so green, Those large fruits that burn between, Each a laugh new lit. Now I know not what they were, The light fires that trembled there Sharp and thin in the soft air, Nor the faces dumb and fair, Nor the happy singing near; But I seem to see her hair And the light on it. Day by day and hour by hour Grew her white face like a flower, Palest where the day grew lower On the fiery sea. Always sate I, watching her, By her carven gilded chair, Full of wonder and great fear If one long lock of her hair In the soft wind sink or stir, Fallen to her knee. All about her face and head The flat sunset overspread Like an aureole of red, Stained as drops from wounds that bled In some bitter fight. All the tender shapen head Dimly blurred with golden red, And the thin face, as I said, Drawn and white as snows wind-shed On the green place of the dead In a windy night. Coloured flakes of stormy fire Clomb the rent clouds high and higher, And the wind like a great lyre Sounded vague and loud. And the sunset lines that flee On the flats of fiery sea Far below us, her and me, Were as golden red to see As the heaped hair on her knee Or as the coloured cloud. So we sat in love and fear, And no faces came anear, And no voices touched our ear But of angels singing clear Out of all the sunset drear Round us and above. And she listened; and a light Shivered upward in my sight Thro' her set face, sad and white; Till I hid mine eyes for fright And for very love. Drear and void the sunset was On stained flats of fire and glass Where she saw the angels pass That I could not see: For none eyes but hers might pierce Thro' the colours vague and fierce That a sunset weaves and wears; Downward slipt the long thin tears As she turned and sang this verse That she made for me. ‘Eastward under skies that dip As to touch the water's lip, Pass, my ship, with sails that drip Not with dew, nor with rain. Thro' the morning float and pass From the shores of flower and grass, Thro' a space of golden glass Stained with a blood-red stain. Evil ship on evil sea, Bear him back again to me Till I see what secrets be Hidden in all this pain.’ Then she spake not, neither stirred, But I shook for that one word With the pain of that I heard That she spake of me. For the ship that seemed to pass Thro' the sea of fiery glass, That strange ship mine own soul was And my life the sea. And the sin that I had done In the fierce time that was gone When I slew her knight alone Face to face with the red sun Setting in the west. And my soul began to see All the ill she had of me When I bore her to the sea From her place of rest. Yet I loved her long and well; Yea, my tongue would tire to tell All the love that her befell, And the slow speech faint and fail Ere the love was told. Now she dwelleth by me here, In my castle builded fair; But no crown of mine will wear That I thought to keep for her, And on her beloved hair Lay the royal gold. And her face grows grey and long And harsh breaths come thro' her song And her heart is worn with wrong, As is plain to see. Should I die, no help it were Now men say she is not fair, For the pain she seems to wear In grey cheeks and waning hair; All my love avails not her, And she loves not me. Vain was the prayer I prayed alway, Where in evil case I lay, That she might love me one day As the manner is; Vain the prayer that I have prayed, That, lying between light and shade, I that loved her as I said, I that never kissed a maid, I might have her kiss. THE DEATH OF RUDEL Lift me a little on my bed, All this day about my head Sudden sounds have fled and fled As the waters flee. I look into the sunset red, I put both hands behind my head To hear if anything be said, I lie as one that long is dead; I pray you, lift me on this bed That I may hear and see. So now, you feel my time hath ran, Men will praise me as they can For the honour that I wan, ‘This Rudel was a famous man,’ For kings have praisèd me. I ask you what avail is this? Better for a man it is To have had of her one kiss That in life and love was his, Than to have all praise. Tell me, wherein shall this avail? For, see, my hands are lean and pale, And at my heart the warm veins fail, And I have had my days. And this life of mine has gone Thro' its times of mirth and moan, And kiss of maiden had I none, Tho' I never loved but one All this life of mine. Help of love have I not had, And sometimes my heart grew mad, That all other men were glad While I went so white and sad At the revels the king bade Where they drank their wine. All night long and day by day While on this ill bed I lay, Thro' the bloom and balm of May The same noise have I heard. The dull waters slipping slow, The wan waters lapping low, And no pleasant breath would blow, And no song would help me so As one spoken word. All this pain avails me not, Heart and head are weak and hot, The hope is withered from my thought, The love is plucked out of my lot As feathers from a bird. At Tripoli The sharp cords slacken, the keel sways, I hear the fretted shingle graze, A rippling anger stirs and frays Along the golden water-ways; We should be close on land. Ah! Christ, that yet for all my pain In this heart and beating brain (Lest men say my love were vain), I might but touch her hand. I am so tired, I cannot see The black masts corded over me, And past my head strange noises flee, Noises flee and fade. In the light and in the gloom I feel new faces go and come, Saddened all, and tender some As face of any maid. Ah! the rustle of her feet, Ah! the murmur faint and sweet, Thro' the blowing snows that fleet Round and over me. This is she that I would have; Lo, the eyes so great and grave, And the lips of power to save, That I came to see. I praise God that I shall die, From thin lips a thin glad cry Brake as I beheld her nigh, To praise God for this. Ah! she never saw me yet, But her pearl-white lids seem wet; Will she love me or forget As the manner is? Her gold hair, heavy and sweet, Clothes her straight from face to feet, As she stoops the tresses stroops meet. Ah, dear Lord, I prayed for it, I have had her kiss. (He dies.) BALLAD It was when cocks began to crow And the dawn lay white and low. The mother slept upon the bed, The child slept on her bosom dead. When the floor was grey with light, She looked into the dawn all white. A bird sang at the window-sill And of its song was never still. As she heard him singing sweet, Fear crept down her to the feet. She looked against the morning red, And knew that the white child was dead. She looked against the morning bird, It sang, she spake not any word. She cursed it in her heart and wept, And very still the white child slept. ‘O sister, sing me some old word, For I would not hear the singing bird.’ ‘O what is this pain about your face? And what shall I sing in the dead child's place?’ ‘Fear not here to sing my song, For the child shall feel no wrong.’ Then the maiden's singing shrill All the frore grey dawn did fill. ‘What thing is this? I hear no word But ever the same song of the bird. ‘Thou dost not well to use me so, Thy song is very dull and low.’ ‘O sister, the song is new and sweet, It is the dead child singing it.’ The white bird from the sill was gone, The white face shone in the straight sun. Ere the sweet new song was done, On two dead faces came the sun. Ere the song was ended meet, The mother's voice was mixed in it. Under the drawn threads of the shroud Came two voices that sang loud. The girls that carried out the bier Felt their set hands loosen with fear. Under the grass for two days long There sang all day a sweet new song. In a green place both lie dead, The child sleeps at the grave's head. SECOND LOVE O what have you done with your brave brown horse. Tell me for the love of me? Red beaks are muffled in his corse, And no more praise shall he have of me. O what have ye done with your small white bird That sang so on the hand of me? It shall not sing ye any word, It feeds not on the land of me. O what have ye done with your thin gold ring That I bade ye keep for me? I would not keep me anything, That eyes of none should weep for me. O what have ye done with your straight bright sword, That shone so for the gold of it? It slipped in the water of the ford, Where my right hand left hold of it. O what have ye done with your fair new bride, For the praise she had of ye? I would be lying at her side, And O but she were glad of me! O what have ye done with the soft warm hair She cut from off the head of her? I laid it on her bosom bare, And no more shall be said of her. And what have ye done with the scented glove I gave ye for the scent of it? I gave it to my fair new love, And she kist the thin white rent of it. And what have ye done with the flask of wine I kept for ye to drink of it? I gave her of the sweet hot wine, That makes me cold to think of it. THE QUEEN'S TRAGEDY I do not think that God has cared for us. I said that, seeing when they took my lord And got about him with their wicked hands, Their long brown fingers clenched about his hair, And smote and slew him. Do not touch me, girls; I did not bid you swarm all round my bed With faces heaped on faces; for indeed I am not very patient with my heart, And I may strike you if you trouble me. Now sometimes, if my lord would come to me Out of the hot black ceremonial troop Wherethro' I see him riding in my dreams, I would not kiss him on the buried mouth; For, verily, I tell you as things be, There have been worms about it. See my lips, Shall they kiss where the worms have been? for once He said, ‘Those lips have caught the shadowed crown Of petals stained with sunlight in their dew, So the dear smile clings at them, comes and goes, And makes me faint with wonder of her smile.’ I pray you very humbly of my love, Let not the fair light hurt me; so it comes And crawls about me, sliding out and in, Till one must weep or curse, and I would rest. I do not love the sky nor light that grows Up in the morning, slow as if a prayer Began to alter in the dying voice, And trembled and clomb higher in the throat. That is the sky's prayer, prayed in psalms of light; And prayer is vain. Moreover I have prayed And seen no face of God nor any saint, And have not peace; so I hate light, for there Sits God with all His saints and laugh at me, They mock me in the sun and in the moon, They mock me in the rainfall and the stars. Dear Christ, if they had only strangled him, If they had only stabbed him where he slept, His hands in mine, his face against the lamp, The lamp that made thin patterns on the wall, I think I could have lived then, certainly. I had been very patient, and Thou, Lord, Hadst wondered for my patience and come down To help me, putting Thy calm hands in mine Even where his lay, and spoken blessed words, And loosened all my heart to make me die. I know not why men call Thee merciful; For this was not. And now Thou seest me here, I wonder in Thy light and in Thy shade, I scorn to all Thy servants as they pass, And how should this not be? for I have heard That with strong hands they plucked him by the hair, And trod on him, and smote upon his mouth, And cut with a great axe of smooth white steel Thro' his white throat, and rent away the head To nail it up against their city walls. All this I heard or seem myself to see Till mine eyes ache, and a slow pain puts out A cold hand in the hollow of my heart To feel for pasture; and my throat grows thick, And a deep anger sobs into my voice, And my hands shut and open. O my God, I am no girl that has not borne much pain And will grow past her sorrow as a tree Past the green withes one plaits about its base; I have lived and wrought my work, and I am here Cast down into the darkness of Thy hate, With noises blown about me in the dark, And great seas beating round and over me. For now, thro' all the miserable nights That grow between me and that face of thine, Strange things creep round me lying in this bed, Lean fingers touch my forehead and my lips, Damp touches taint me to the core of sense, And I am left as a polluted thing Men spit on, lying bruised along the road, And hidden in her weeping hair, and wet With mire and blood; even such am I; for now, If one should come and smite me on the cheek, If one should come and spit into my mouth, I do not think that God would take revenge. What now? Why should you catch my hands in yours? What would these girls? You will not let me come And pluck this hair out that he used to kiss, To kiss all over till it seemed to creep And tingle with the trembling of his lips. Now all the colour is gone out of it, And all the glory gone out of my face As paint one washes off a broken mask. I must kneel too, then! I must put my hands As in a prayer one puts them up to God, To pray you of your pity let me sleep! For look, I cannot sleep for all this pain, And till I sleep I shall be sick at heart And weaker than the snapped stem of a rose. Nay but by God I will not pray at all, Nor weep to you because you love me not. I will have men to come and bind your hands, And bruise you with most heavy chains of steel, And drive a thick bolt in over your heads, So ye shall lie on naked floors and writhe With foul damp touches crawling over you, With great worms feeding up and down your limbs. And I shall laugh and look across the grate And see you heaped about the wet red mire, Face downwards in a huddle of live slime, And you will writhe with miserable limbs And turn to see me laughing in the sun. Ah, girls, when he is come to me again I shall put on my crownet, and a robe Ashine from hem to hem and skirt by skirt With twisted gold in threads, and overthwart With light of many jewels, emerald And hyacinth and the white flame of pearls, And seek him as the evening seeks a star, And find him as the midnight finds the moon. I shall put on my crown and go to him, And he will take me round with both his arms, And kiss me. But for love I think of him I shall not answer save with eyes and face, Lit from the marvel of his face and eyes, And he will smile and bow himself and say, ‘Look, sweet, there are my hands I put on yours, This is my hair that stoops to brush your neck As I stoop down to kiss you on the mouth.’ Then I shall weep and say some foolish thing Because I shudder still thro' all my blood From his great kiss; and he will say—by Christ I will not have you know what he will say. But I shall laugh and gather close to him, My face and all my body and my hair Bowed over him as rain when a cloud stoops, Closer than dew clings round a dying flower. Then shall I loose my hands and cry and say, ‘Ah, Love, what is this line upon your throat?’ And he will tremble and grow lean and pale. (I shall feel sick with fear of his cold face) And he will slip between my arms and go. Then shall I bruise my arms against the ground, And crush my bosom harder on the stone, And beat my bare face on the floor and die. Yea, now would I so beat my lips and bruise And break myself against the bitter stone, And drag my cheeks and hair upon the ground, And mar my flesh with blows if I were free. For I begin to think the word of death Is a lewd jape, a thin and blind report Made to deceive men of their wretchedness; But so will I be not deceived of mine, Because I love it. O my God, O God, I knew them, when they spake and had no heart, Sat talking of a child to make me mad; For it was never writ of any man That he had pain like mine and was not mad. Yea, I was present, O dear Lord—indeed Said nothing, only gazed into my hair, And wept because they hurt me with their words; Because I knew the trouble, and the change Of shadow and of colour round the brow, And round the eyes and the warm little mouth That is cold now and has not earth on it, And all the rainy place is cold for it, In the soft, narrow grave where I would be! Nathless, I thought that till God shut me up I might have lived without remembering it. But now the bitter sweetness stings me thro' As sharp wine stings and curdles all one's mouth, Runs thro' me in a trembling of the blood, And the small hands that wandered on my face With sweet and doubtful touches, and the feet Thrust out that could not stand or run at all, And the grave eyes so full and passionate That never child but mine had such a face. O dearest Mother whose eyes long ago Christ kissed in heaven, made pure of any tear, I pray thee, Mother, help me for my pain, Who am but sinful woman and too weak. To think how the small face would stare in mine With finger-clasp of sweet imperial hands, And tender tremble of beseeching lips— The child, the child, O pity, O my child! Lo now, you see me that I am not mad. For how should one remember this and live? If it were possible one might go mad, I would kneel always on my barèd knees Under the lamp until my heart were sick, With steady swim of incense even-wise, Along the dense air in and out the lamps Until my blood grew thick and my hands loose And my head heavily smote upon the stone. Also at night when you that are no queens As God knows, all you miserable girls Sleep with your foolish faces pillowed up In soft hot rooms made quiet with your breath, I would kneel naked there in all the light And pray till both my lips were worn, and all This lean flesh wasted from me, till some man Found me some white and bitter time of dawn With thin hands praying and set lips of prayer And loose limbs on the floor, naked and dead; And over me the insolent cold sun, And gaunt white flames a-shiver on the lamps; And round me all the carven church-work, saints Painted about the windows marvellous, And lean stone faces with intolerant lips, And brows drawn back for eyes to stare me blind. God help me! Look, I am not mad at all; Tho' all these nights, lying along my bed, Flung out at level with these heavy limbs, I see the shadows of the muffled walls Alter about me, crawl and turn and shift, Changed just to mock me; and men's voices cry Sharper than scorn, and the noise thrills my hair, So close it tingles as they seem to say ‘A queen, a queen!’ As then a laughter grows About my heart and makes me hot, I know That many would go mad for less than I To have such laughter tighten in one's throat, And choke one till it made him deaf and blind. For I have come to hear I was a queen, Might not another die so? Then I take My hair and pull it closer on the face And lie and weep through it great tears like these. I pray you do not let me bleed to death. I will be patient and not weep at all If you will help me. Look, I do not weep Tho' there are women weeping for less pain. I pray you help me lest I bleed to death. My heart is full of weeping, and both eyes Stained thro' with some red sight of agony, And a slow pain eats thro' me, limb by limb, As fire eats wood; now, if I can pray loud, Now God must hear me. Ah, but I am filled With some obscure pollution which devours My flesh and blood and breath; and so I lie Deeper within my grave than any sleep In some green place under the dropping dews. I have seen many things and done much ill, And lived a broken life filled full of change Ere this; for never any woman lived Such life out since I grew a child too sad For holiday or playtime of the rest. In that lean castle by the thin white stream Shackled with pallid nets of river-weed, I grew there with no help of the warm sun, Nor light of tender faces one might love. And then I grew a woman and a queen, Filled as one fills a vessel with hot wine Up to the carven lips of gold, so filled By a great love that held me body and soul, That made me white and cruel, cold, and thin, And yet I tell you that I was beloved. Yea verily, no woman hath more love Of any man that holds her in his hands And kisses her till she grow faint for pain, Than I had of my lord when I was queen. For now I flush and shudder as the sea Under a red and creeping light of dawn, Remembering the kisses and the words That each kiss ended on the lips, and all The gazing that consumes me flesh and soul. So may I find him somewhere when I die, Climb somehow to him over toothèd stones That steam and drip with blood of both my feet; Climb to him, weeping eyes and laughing lips Under a huddled rain of hair, and say, ‘O Love, I know this was thy blazon once, When all men praised me for my knight, even me; White wings against a floor of smooth red gold; And this, dear, was that poor blue scarf of mine, Long since I drew so close over thy wound That bled and drenched it thro' the colour, stained And stained thro' all the golden woof of it. And this, Love, is that very face you had When I would weep for anger or some grief Till your laugh spoilt the kiss I had of you.’ Ah, dearest Lord, if such a thing might be, What I would give you of my love, O Lord! I would have painters to paint you wall by wall Even to the dark aisle-chapels, out of sight, White angels very glorious, and Thy saints Crowned in a great smooth splendour of white light And clothed upon with colour, wonderful, And Virgins with brows overbent for weight Of their large aureoles, and calm claspt hands Lain evenwise about the child that sleeps, Painted, O Lord, as fair as mine own child's, As marvellous with hair and mouth and eyes. Yea, such things blazoned in and out the walls As should rejoice Thee for my service, Lord, And make men praise Thee for this work of mine. And altars carven in rough golden frames, And candles of pure flame, wool-white and smooth, And such sharp incense as the Arab grates From the tree's costliest heart, and myrrh to burn Before Thee in the golden holiness, And all from roof to floor diverse and strange With royal gloom and light, and over-full With songs and odours blown thro' wealthiest air; A glorious church to stand up in Thy sight And praise Thee before all the nations, Lord! Only I pray Thee let me see his face. Know not even these that huddle there agape With meaningless white faces, know they not That God is pleased with service? So at last When all this work is finished I shall come And kiss him on the forehead and the mouth, And on the smooth imperial white throat Set large and stately without any scar. Indeed I know not how I seem to live, Sometimes I feel more light than any bird That dips between the leaves thro' golden shade And thro' white sunshine; otherwhiles I think That all the years are gathering up in rain Like clouds the wind brings oversea from France; It is the south wind shakes our blossoms, look! Moreover, love, I pray you kiss me close On mouth and brow, because you see my rose Has withered for the kisses of the rain. And I will sing to sweeten my red mouth, And plait my hair till all the lines be smooth, And speak as sweetly till I sing again. For so you praised me singing long ago, And I remember as the seasons blow From summer into summer, and I make My recollection sweeter for regret Than the dead odour of a violet, I pray you love me for that summer's sake. Oxford, 1859. UNDERGRADUATE SONNETS I [When I behold the summer's glory paint] When I behold the summer's glory paint The winter-wrinkled cheek of earth with pride, And overcome with sweet the bitter taint That angry seasons laid by spring's fair side: And all the sullen-working clouds supprest That sat upon the green head of the year, The tender May with humorous flaws opprest Lift up again her sweet enamour'd cheer; Their sight would pour a balm about my pain, And hush the cry that rends my parted soul, But that in all things fair I see too plain Some lurking treason doth bewitch the whole, And thought doth tell me that thy absence takes The golden gloss from all the Summer wakes. II [Deep passions rock my weariness asleep] Deep passions rock my weariness asleep, Forgetting that my rest doth rest with thee: And from the abysm of old delirious deep The hideous face of grief glares out on me: And I am wearier of my false rest Than of true labour working all my life: But wouldst thou lend the harbourage of thy breast To my woe-wearied thought, this sleepy strife Should have a waking and a fineless end; For thine it is love, to dispose of me; Show thou to me true traitor or false friend, I can but put the show of praise on thee; I can but swear thy seeming sanctity, Thy feigning truth, pure love thy cruelty. III [How canst thou tax my faith of windy change] How canst thou tax my faith of windy change, Whose heart is knitted to thy tyrant breast? Thou in whose broad unmeasur'd scope of range The thought is lost that reckons its unrest! O false and fair, dishonour'd in thy pride, What glory is it that will crown thee now? Speake of a trustless hope, a fancy wide And wandering as the air, whose noble brow Is written on and markt with lines of shame, Is it not thine? And when the saddest tune Doth soothe the winds with music, and her flame Pales in the wan cheeke of the weary man, And night's weake fires are quencht, who then but I Can plaine of truth, when by thy sin I die? IV [To you, false witnesses of time beguil'd] To you, false witnesses of time beguil'd And periur'd brokers of my follies past, When expectation's discontented child, Despair, did mocke the carefull season's wast, I do bequeath this last and perfect truth; Your wandering lines are forged and lying tales; Her whom ye prais'd for love and glorious youth, To mocke with idle flattery naught avails; She is not fair nor true nor lov'd nor worth The emptie cost of this expended wrath; A falser never rob'd the dullard earth In glory, nor did light her darkling path; Nor fair nor true nor lov'd nor clear ye prove her, And I believe your warrant; but I love her. V [I love thee; though my verse revolt and swear] I love thee; though my verse revolt and swear Thou art not worthy, I must love thee still; Some cruell planet full of wrath and feare Lowr'd on my birth, grim herald to this ill; I hate thy falsehood that is part of thee, I love the beauty that doth overpaint it; I love the brightness there, and will not see For its rich sweetness what a curse doth taint it. Yet shall thy name live ripen'd in my song, And when thy limbs are dust, thy fault forgotten, My constant faith shall pale thee from the throng, Thy praise shall bloom, when envy's blame is rotten The one shall live in glory, and to thee Lend of its praise; the other die with me. VI [O thou, fair honour of all gentle vowes] O thou, fair honour of all gentle vowes, Dear queen to whom all love brings sacrifice, Why dost thou cloude the glory of those eies, And furrow the clear ivory of thy brows? Dost thou not see, or art thou slow to feel, How much more worthy is a perfect name Than beauty touch'd with show of cankering shame? How Time's unmerciful hand doth gently steal The glory of thy memories away, Leaving thy deeds bare to the naked day? Ere it be late, let thy true beautie veil The borrow'd falsehood of those envious tongues; Ere thy rich eie be dim, thy full cheeke pale, Redeem thy beauty from enduring wrongs. VII [Ah, wherefore does my pity counsel thee] Ah, wherefore does my pity counsel thee, But to approve her blindness? Dost not shame, O false and beautiful, to build thy fame Upon the ruines of dead misery? Thy sin hath slain my soul; yet not alone Its rank transgression in so base a choice As bares thy honour to the public voice Doth wound me, as that thy fault is mine own. Was there no way to kill thy lover's soul, Than dainty poison hidden in a kiss? Thou didst with honey touch the murderous bowl, To speed me hence in a false slaughterous bliss. Was there no way, O flatterer, to destroy, But by the new-strewn flower of seeming joy? THE CUP OF GOD'S WRATH I Drink deep and spare not: it is great and wide; The corners of it are made thick with gold; The wine of it was trodden out of old In the wine-press of Egypt, where man's pride Was in his purple raiment sewn and dyed, And he grew lusty in God's sight, and bold. The grapes of it were never bought or sold. God's anger hath made red its throat and side; Choice of quaint spices hath he mixed therein, And poisoned honey of a bitter juice, Under that heavy lid where it hath been Covered like oil within a little cruise: What man hath will to wet his lips between, The wine is poured and trodden for his use. II As one mows down to burn dead grass and weeds Wherein the corn was choked and overgrown, So in Time's hand hath Change the sickle mown An overgrowth of evil days and deeds; And, as in meadows where the strong flame feeds, The land is waste and eaten to the bone In fields of dust with ashes overblown To where the river trembles in its reeds, So are the churches and broad halls burnt up; The priests and princes gathered into sheaves And bound for burning; such a fire begins The melting of gold pieces and gold sins, Ill treasure-traffic, the market-place of thieves, For whose sake God shall pour out all his cup. Oxford. THE DREAM BY THE RIVER Sweet river flowing south, I take of thy lily leaves To bind in snowy sheaves Out of the dry noon's drouth. Thy water slippeth sweet Over my dipping feet, Sweet from the warm touch of my lady's mouth Over the quivering brink Last noon she leant to drink When winds were dry about the bitter south, Seeming to blow, and sink, and grow, and sink, Faint as the drenched dead petals lift and blink. I dip my face and hair All burnt and bare Into the water where she leant to drink,— I smile to think. Dipping feet and dripping hair, Through the curls and over the feet Slips and slides the water fleet Down its channels sharp and rare. Mine arms are soiled with a brown stain, No stain of rust; My limbs are thin with fever-pain, My bare feet rough with dust. I have come out to rest my heart and think On the white water's brink. Thin threads and webs of tortured gold That these tender shallows fold, Little reeds that curl and dip As any ripple takes them, Beams that break and shades that slip When the sun awakes them,— It was here I kissed her lip, Kissed her brows up out of sleep. It was here I slew him,— Before the great pain came on me; Here my stroke went thro' him, Straight and sharp that all might see The red thin bloodthreads creep. Then all my pleasures seem, As these faint weeds in the set stream, Drawn steady down a dream,— Full of murmurs and of lights, Strange new sounds and sweet new sights; And after many things Came a sharp noise of wings, A hiss of cloven air, And clink of chainmail rings And stir of battle there. And then two faces side by side, And one face very fair. Past and past the waters glide, And I bathe my hands and hair. Lo, my hands stain not the stream. Did I not say this was a dream? Face nor hands are hard and red, And soft leaves drop all round my head, And soft weeds round my dipping feet Stir and change and gleam. I rest! My rest is very sweet. SOUTHWARDS This is the song that I sung of her Out of my heart where she sits and smiles; All over her face grew a soft, slow stir As a tide-wind makes on the sea for miles. She has more love than the first white rose That comes to comfort the thin, weak air; Her eyes have a smile they would not lose Though all the world should be wroth with her. She has more life than the swallow has When it flickers and wheels in the sharpening morn; Her eyes are like violets muffled in grass When the lids draw down and dream of scorn. She has a mouth that a flower would kiss If she stooped with her slow smile over it. There is no man that can call it his, Nor say if the touch of it be sweet. She has a head that is shapen smooth, Carved as the marble a workman smites; And, oh, that smile that grows up from the mouth, I lie and dream of it long nights. For first the lips begin to move, And then a light to trouble the cheeks; And then the eyes take it for their love, And all the face is a smile that speaks. And all the face is a song and sings, And one's eyes at watch miss never a word; And each line means so many things, One thinks not how the first line stirred. And this is the face that my lady has, And I know not how she seems so fair; For her brows are only smooth as glass, And mere sun's gold lies over her hair. No man has ever kissed her mouth, Kissed her eyes 'till the lids drew down. She sits and looks towards the south, And her low song is never done. If I might touch her long pale hand That lies so straight upon her knee, I would give all my lordly land, And all the days that I shall see. If I might kiss her on the eyes, On the lids so white and long, On the smooth brow that overlies, I would give all my praise of song. If I might kiss her on the mouth, Standing with her as the June day set, Where her chamber looks to the golden south, I would die ere the grass were wet. This is my lady I sing so for, She sits in her chamber looking south; And she looks out by window and door, And no one comes to kiss her mouth. And I can only sing of her; And if new faces about her came, I could strike but once for her dear gold hair, And die there without any fame. And my blood would glow about her feet, Running about her warm and wet; And she would sit in the window-seat, And think of me as the June day set. And then were I much happier, For all my song is gone away; And I cannot breathe for the thought of her That is about me all the day. And now am I better than I was once, For once I did not care for her; And once I thought that the warm June suns Were coloured warmer than her hair. So now I know that I was mad, And there is nothing in me good; And no man's praising makes me glad As to hear him praise my lady would. Once I sang better songs than this You trouble with your frowning smiles; I knew not then how the green shore's kiss Sweetens the bitter sea for miles. I knew not what this woman was, Nor what the birds and summers mean; Nor why the violets hide in grass, Nor why the dear deep leaves are green. And this was all that I had to say, But there is somewhat left untold; For no man knows one still green day That any hands touched her hair's warm gold. She was asleep on the window seat, Both hands lay out along her knees; Over them swept the warm hair sweet, And the dear head bent over these. She sat in the window looking south, I did not mean to speak to her; I did not mean to kiss her mouth, Only I stooped and felt her hair. And since that day, and every day, I think how tenderly it stirred; The sunbeams filled it as it lay, Then I went out and spake no word. JOYEUSE GARDE The sun was heavy; no more shade at all Than you might cover with a hollow cup There was in the south chamber; wall by wall, Slowly the hot noon filled the castle up. One hand among the rushes, one let play Where the loose gold began to swerve and droop From his fair mantle to the floor, she lay; Her face held up a little, for delight To feel his eyes upon it, one would say. Her grave shut lips were glad to be in sight Of Tristram's kisses; she had often turned Against her shifted pillows in the night To lessen the sore pain wherein they burned For want of Tristram; her great eyes had grown Less keen and sudden, and a hunger yearned Her sick face through, these wretched years agone. Her eyes said ‘Tristram’ now, but her lips held The joy too close for any smile or moan To move them; she was patiently fulfilled With a slow pleasure that slid everwise Even into hands and feet, but could not build The house of its abiding in her eyes, Nor measure any music by her speech. Between the sunlight came a noise of flies To pain sleep from her, thick from peach to peach Upon the bare wall's hot red level, close Among the leaves too high for her to reach. So she drew in and set her feet, and rose Saying ‘Too late to sleep; I pray you speak To save me from the noises, lest I lose Some minute of this season; I am weak And cannot answer if you help me not, When the shame catches on my brow and cheek.’ For in the speaking all her face grew hot, And her mouth altered with some pain, I deem Because her word had stung like a bad thought That makes us recollect some bitter dream. She bowed to let him kiss her, and went on: ‘All things are changed so, will this day not seem Most sad and evil when I sit alone Outside your eyes? will it not vex my prayer To think of laughter that is twin to moan, And happy words that make not holier? Nathless I had good will to say one thing, Though it seems pleasant in the late warm air To ride alone and see the last of spring. I cannot lose you, Tristram; (a weak smile Moved her lips and went out) men say the king Hath set keen spies about for many a mile, Quick hands to get them gold, sharp eyes to see Where your way swerves across them. This long while Hath Mark grown older with his hate of me, And now his hand for lust to smite at us Plucks the white hairs inside his beard that he This year made thicker. Seeing this he does I pray you note that we may meet with him At riding through the branches growth, and then Our wine grow bitter at the golden rim And taste of blood and tears, not sweet to drink As this new honey wherein juices swim Of fair red vintage.’ Her voice done, I think He had no heart to answer; yet some time The noon outside them seem to throb and sink, Wrought in the quiet to a rounded rhyme. Then ‘certes,’ said he, ‘this were harm to both If spears grew thick between the beech and lime, Or amid reeds that let the river south, Yet so I think you might get help of me. Had I not heart to smile, when Iseult's mouth Kissed Palomydes under a thick tree? For I remember, as the wind sets low, How all that peril ended quietly In a green place where heavy sunflowers blow.’ A LAY OF LILIES There be five lilies growing on a hill; There be five maidens dwelling under it. Square sets the grey gaunt castle where they dwell, And thro' dead grass the moths at evening flit About and under it. The girls are like the lilies, very white. The first is fairest for her pale hair's gold, One for her cheeks, one for her eyes' delight, One for her smile round which the dimples fold, One for her warm lips' mould. Five lilies blow about the blowing hill, And the five maidens walk by three and two Each morning from the grey place where they dwell, To feel the wind wherein those lilies blow. All this is years ago. And the first every morning that she came Put her pure lips upon the petals pure, And her hair on the sceptre's golden flame Which standeth like a planted spear secure Straight in the petals pure. The second every time would stoop and take One leaf; so day by day the lily sank From the stalk bare as winter for her sake; And day by day the torn petals shrank Till all the lily sank. The third would only stoop herself to smell The faint sweet smell among the tender leaves, And her heart gladdened if the sun shone well, For then she stooping with her purfled sleeves; Brushed the dim-scented leaves. The fourth would lay herself to sleep beside Her flower, when the noon was very hot, For then she felt the even shadow slide Across her lids, and sleeping so forgot All things that pleased her not. The fifth would sit upon the plaited moss Each morning, when the soft light slanted there, And sweet rays came her level brows across, And twilight on the lustre of her hair As she sat meekly there. Tender and beautiful each maiden was, And quiet smiles grew always at the heart As they went duly through the thick wet grass To learn the lilies how they shone apart, Each from its golden heart. But never any face of man came near To the grey windy castle by the hill; So had they never joy of love nor fear For all their love the lilies did fulfil The wind and grass and hill. And the spring came, whispering her thoughts of green To all the folded hollows in the wood; And leaves began to stir and talk between The lean black rents where broken branches stood There spikes of iron wood. And for the secret that those lilies had They altered not the whole white winter long; But one day when the primroses were glad, And the low leaves were shaken into song, A new death-note was rung. In spring one girl was buried; it was June When one was hidden, face and hands and feet, With a cold grave-sheet from the sun and moon; In August when the red corn's gold was sweet, A third was clad in it. And when the tall ears gathered warm and ripe For August, full of low whispers in the sun, And green was stained with red or golden stripe Thro' the flushed leaves whose pale warm spring was gone, Another life was done. Winds rose about the doubtful woods, and smote Late autumn into angry music; strain Heard after strain in the long dark afloat. Beneath in shifting lights of marsh and fen Glimmered the dim waste plain. Through the stained window on dead cheek and mouth Came a dull light. She saw not, neither heard In her dark chamber fronting the dark south; And her long folded vesture no more stirred Than feet of a dead bird. In the midwinter died the last of these. She slept all huddled from the windy cold; Up to the cold chin gathered the cold knees, And over her straight vesture's flow and fold Lay hair of coloured gold. They found her in the morning still, asleep; A bitter smile drew up the painful face And over it cold wrinkles seemed to creep As she lay dead in that forsaken place, With lean unhappy face. So was she buried out of the warm sun, And the last lily that midwinter died The day whereon her maiden life was done. No flowers grow where they lie side by side As one by one they died. But grasses very thick and clover-shoots Without the sharp, pink spears of bloom they had, And herbs a wind makes tremble to the roots. Their death and unbeloved life were sad: God make them very glad. ECHO In the dusk of starlit hours Thro' the woodland's dewy maze Scattering music, scattering flowers Down the glimmering forest ways, O'er the smooth moss-paven level, Past the mountain's windy brow, Come the Nymphs in crowded revel, Calling, Echo, Echo! where art thou? By the far and misty glimmer Of these pale Lethean lakes, Whose dusk waves in twilight shimmer When the faint Sun on them breaks, Where no sorrowing thoughts appal thee, Hast thou sought a place of sleep Heeding not how loud we call thee— Echo, Echo!—thro' the woodlands deep? We have sought thee till the Hours, Slowly darkening to the west, Left thee turning funeral flowers In some haunt of dreary rest, Where the cloud of dewy tresses On thy wan and downcast brow Like a weight of sorrow presses; Call aloud, Echo! Echo! where art thou? In the soft green summer-meadows Where the silent streams are flowing, In the happy woodland shadows Where the softest winds are blowing, Where amid their heapèd flowers Children call thee soft and low, In the hush of golden hours Singing, Echo, Echo! where art thou? When the wind-vext earth returneth To the light of stormless days, And the wide noon-splendour burneth On the lustrous ocean-ways, Still thou sittest weeping lowly In the dim heart of the brakes, In the silence wide and holy— Echo, Echo!—which the deep wood makes. Echo, Echo! we are weary And the forest-path is long, And the brightest glades are dreary If unwaken'd by thy song. Hark! her voice afar is singing— O our sister, where art thou? All the joyous words are ringing; Be with us, Echo! Echo! hear us now. Oxford. DIES IRÆ Day of wrath, the years are keeping, When the world shall rise from sleeping, With a clamour of great weeping! Earth shall fear and tremble greatly To behold the advent stately Of the Judge that judgeth straitly. And the trumpet's fierce impatience Scatter strange reverberations Thro' the graves of buried nations. Death and Nature will stand stricken When the hollow bones shall quicken And the air with weeping thicken. When the Creature, sorrow-smitten, Rises where the Judge is sitting And beholds the doom-book written. For, that so his wrath be slakèd, All things sleeping shall be wakèd, All things hidden shall be naked. When the just are troubled for thee, Who shall plead for me before thee, Who shall stand up to implore thee? Lest my great sin overthrow me, Let thy mercy, quickened thro' me, As a fountain overflow me! For my sake thy soul was movèd; For my sake thy name reprovèd, Lose me not whom thou hast lovèd! Yea, when shame and pain were sorest, For my love the cross thou borest, For my love the thorn-plait worest. By that pain that overbore thee, By those tears thou weepest for me, Leave me strength to stand before thee. For the heart within me yearneth, And for sin my whole face burneth; Spare me when thy day returneth. By the Magdalen forgiven, By the thief made pure for heaven, Even to me thy hope was given. Tho' great shame be heavy on me, Grant thou, Lord, whose mercy won me, That hell take not hold upon me. Thou whom I have lovèd solely, Thou whom I have lovèd wholly, Leave me place among the holy! When thy sharp wrath burns like fire, With the chosen of thy desire, Call me to the crownèd choir! Prayer, like flame with ashes blending, From my crushed heart burns ascending; Have thou care for my last ending. ODE TO MAZZINI I A voice comes from the far unsleeping years, An echo from the rayless verge of time, Harsh, with the gathered weight of kingly crime, Whose soul is stained with blood and bloodlike tears, And hearts made hard and blind with endless pain, And eyes too dim to bear The light of the free air, And hands no longer restless in the wonted chain, And valiant lives worn out By silence and the doubt That comes with hope found weaponless and vain; All these cry out to thee, As thou to Liberty, All, looking up to thee, take heart and life again. II Too long the world has waited. Year on year Has died in voiceless fear Since tyranny began the silent ill, And Slaughter satiates yet her ravenous will. Surely the time is near— The dawn grows wide and clear; And fiercer beams than pave the steps of day Pierce all the brightening air And in some nightly lair The keen white lightning hungers for his prey, Against his chain the growing thunder yearns With hot swift pulses all the silence burns, And the earth hears, and maddens with delay. III Dost thou not hear, thro' the hushed heart of night, The voices wailing for thy help, thy sight, The souls, that call their lord? ‘We want the voice, the sword, We want the hand to strike, the love to share The weight we cannot bear; The soul to point our way, the heart to do and dare. We want the unblinded eye, The spirit pure and high, And consecrated by enduring care: For now we dare not meet The memories of the past; They wound us with their glories bright and fleet, The fame that would not last, The hopes that were too sweet; A voice of lamentation Shakes the high places of the thronèd nation, The crownless nation sitting wan and bare Upon the royal seat.’ IV Too long the world has waited. Day by day The noiseless feet of murder pass and stain Palace and prison, street and loveliest plain, And the slow life of freedom bleeds away. Still bleached in sun and rain, Lie the forgotten slain On bleak slopes of the dismal mountain-range. Still the wide eagle-wings Brood o'er the sleep of Kings, Whose purples shake not in the wind of change. Still our lost land is beautiful in vain, Where priests and kings defile with blood and lies The glory of the inviolable skies; Still from that loathsome lair Where crawls the sickening air, Heavy with poison, stagnant as despair, Where soul and body moulder in one chain Of inward-living pain: From wasted lives, and hopes proved unavailing; In utterance harsh and strange, With many a fitful change, In laughter and in tears, In triumph and in fears, The voice of earth goes heavenward for revenge: And all the children of her dying year Fill up the unbroken strains From priestly tongues that scathe with lies and vailing The Bourbons' murderous dotard, sick of blood, To the ‘How-long’ of stricken spirits, wailing Before the throne of God. V Austria! The voice is deepening in thine ears And art thou still asleep, Drunken with blood and tears! A murderer's rest should hardly be so deep Till comes the calm unbroken by the years, And those, whose life crawls on thro' dying shame, A thing made up of lies and fears, more vile Than aught that lives and bears a hateful name, For the crowned serpent, skilled in many a wile, Charmed with the venomous honey of its guile The guards until they slept, And only fawned and crept Till Fortune gave it leave to sting and smile! Have not the winds of Heaven and the free waves A voice to bear the curses of thy slaves And the loud hatred of the world! O thou Upon whose shameless brow The crown is as a brand, The sceptre trembles in thy trothless hand; Shrinks not thy soul before the shame it braves, The gathered anger of a patient land, The loathing scorn that hardly bears to name thee? By all the lies that cannot shame thee, By all the memories thou must bear In hushed unspeakable despair; By the Past that follows thee, By the Future that shall be We curse thee by the freedom living still, We curse thee by the hopes thou canst not kill, We curse thee in the name of the wronged earth That gave thy treasons birth. VI Out of a court alive with creeping things A stench has risen to thicken and pollute The inviolate air of heaven that clad of yore Our Italy with light, because these Kings Gather like wasps about the tainted fruit, And eat their venomous way into its core, And soil with hateful hands its golden hue; Till on the dead branch clings A festering horror blown with poison-dew; Then laugh ‘So Freedom loses her last name And Italy is shamèd with our shame!’ For blindness holds them still And lust of craving will: A mist is on their souls who cannot see The ominous light, nor hear the fateful sounds; Who know not of the glory that shall be, And was, ere Austria loosed her winged hounds These double-beak'd and bloody-plumaged things, Whose shadow is the hiding-place of kings. VII Behold, even they whose shade is black around, Whose names makes dumb the nations in their hate, Tremble to other tyrants; Naples bows Aghast, and Austria cowers like a scourged hound Before the priestly hunters: 'tis their fate, Whose fear is as a brand-mark on men's brows, Themselves to shrink beneath a fiercer dread; The might of ancient error Round royal spirits folds its shroud of terror, And at a name the imperial soul is dead. Rome! as from thee the primal curse came forth So comes the retribution: As the flushed murderers of the ravening north Crouch for thine absolution. Exalt thyself, that love or fear of thee Hath shamed thine Austrian bondsmen, and their shame Avenges the vext spirits of the free, Repays the trustless lips, the bloody hands, And all the sin that makes the Austrian name A bye-word among liars—fit to be Thy herald, Rome, among the wasted lands! VIII For wheresoe'er thou lookest, death is there, And a slow curse that stains the sacred air: Such as must hound Italia till she learn Whereon to lean the weight of reverent trust, Learn to see God within her, and not bare Her glories to the ravenous eyes of lust; Vain of dishonour that proclaims her fair. Such insolence of listless pride must earn The scourge of Austria—till mischance in turn Defile her eagles with fresh blood and dust. For tho' the faint heart burn In silence: yet a sullen flame is there Which yet may leap into the sunless air And gather in the embrace of its wide wings The shining spoil of kings. IX But now the curse lies heavy. Where art thou, Our Italy, among all these laid low Too powerless or too desperate to speak— Thou, robed in purple for a priestly show, Thou, buffeted and stricken, blind and weak! Doth not remembrance light thine utter woe? Thine eyes beyond this Calvary look, altho' Brute-handed Austria smite thee on the cheek And her thorns pierce thy forehead, white and meek; In lurid mist half-strangled sunbeams pine, Yet purer than the flame of tainted altars; And tho' thy weak hope falters, It clings not to the desecrated shrine. Tho' thy blank eyes look wanly thro' dull tears, And thy weak soul is heavy with blind fears, Yet art thou greater than thy sorrow is, Yet is thy spirit nobler than of yore, Knowing the keys thy reverence used to kiss Were forged for emperors to bow down before, Not for free men to worship: So that Faith, Blind portress of the gate which opens death, Shall never prate of Freedom any more; For on a priest's tongue such a word is strange, And when they laud who did but now revile, Shall we believe? Rome's lying lips defile The graves of heroes, giving us in change Enough of Saints and Bourbons. Dare ye now Receive her who speaks pleasant words and bland And stretches out the blessing of her hand While the pure blood of freemen stains her brow? O dream not of such reconcilement! Be At least in spirit free When the great sunrise floods your glorious land. X For yet the dawn is lingering white and far, And dim its guiding star; There is a sorrow in the speechless air, And in the sunlight a dull painful glare; The winds, that fold around That soft enchanted ground Their wings of music, sadden into song; The holy stars await Some dawn of glimmering fate In silence—but the time of pain seems long, But here no comfort stills This sorrow that o'erclouds the purple hills. XI The sun is bright, and fair the foamless sea; The winds are loud with light and liberty: But when shall these be free? These hearts that beat thro' stifled pain, these eyes Strained thro' dim prison-air toward the free skies: When shall their light arise? XII Thou! whose best name on earth Is Love—whose fairest birth The freedom of the fair world thou hast made; Whose light in Heaven is life, Whose rest above our strife— Whose bright sky overvaults earth's barren shade; Who hearest all ere this weak prayer can rise, Before whose viewless eyes Unrolled and far the starry future lies; Behold what men have done, What is beneath thy sun— What stains the sceptred hand, sin lifts to thee In prayer-like mockery— What binds the heart Thou madest to be free. Since we are blind, give light— Since we are feeble, smite— How long shall man be scornful in thy sight, ‘Fear not—He cares not, or He does not see?’ XIII We keep our trust tho' all things fail us— Tho' Time nor baffled Hope avail us, We keep our faith—God liveth and is love. Not one groan rises there Tho' choked in dungeon air But He has heard it though no thunders move— And though no help is here, No royal oath, no Austrian lie, But echoes in the listening sky; We know not, yet perchance His wide reply is near. Ah, let no sloth delay, No discord mar its way, Keep wide the entrance for that Hope divine; Truth never wanted swords, Since with his swordlike words Savonarola smote the Florentine. Even here she is not weaponless, but waits Silent at the palace gates, Her wide eyes kindling eastward to the far sunshine. When out of Naples came a tortured voice: Whereat the whole earth shuddered, and forbade The murderous smile on lying lips to fade; The murderous heart in silence to rejoice; She also smiled—no royal smile—as knowing Some stains of sloth washed by the blood then flowing; Their lives went out in darkness—not in vain; Earth cannot hear, and sink to bloodless rest again. And if indeed her waking strength shall prove Worthy the dreams that passing lit her sleep, Who then shall lift such eyes of triumph, who Respond with echoes of a louder love Than Cromwell's England? let fresh praise renew The wan brow's withered laurels with its dew, And one triumphal peace the crownèd earth shall keep. XIV As one who dreaming on some cloud-white peak Hears the loud wind sail past him far and free, And the faint music of the misty sea, Listening till all his life reels blind and weak; So discrownèd Italy With the world's hope in her hands Ever yearning to get free, Silent between the past and future stands. Dim grows the past, and dull, All that was beautiful, As scattered stars drawn down the moonless night: And the blind eyes of Scorn Are smitten by strange morn, And many-thronèd treason wastes before its might: And every sunless cave And time-forgotten grave Is pierced with one intolerable light. Not one can Falsehood save Of all the crowns she gave, But the dead years renew their old delight. The worshipped evil wanes Through all its godless fanes, And falters from its long imperial height, As the last altar-flame Dies with a glorious nation's dying shame. XV And when that final triumph-time shall be, Whose memory shall be kept First of the souls that slept In death ere light was on their Italy? Or which of men more dear than thee To equal-thoughted liberty, Whom here on earth such reverence meets. Such love from Heaven's pure children greets As few dare win among the free! Such honour ever follows thee In peril, banishment, and blame, And all the loud blind world calls shame, Lives, and shall live, thy glorious name, Tho' death, that scorns the robèd slave, Embrace thee, and a chainless grave. While thou livest, there is one Free in soul beneath the sun: And thine out-laboured heart shall be In death more honoured—not more free. XVI And men despond around thee; and thy name The tyrant smiles at, and his priests look pale; And weariness of empty-throated fame, And men who live and fear all things but shame, Comes on thee; and the weight of aimless years Whose light is dim with tears: And hope dies out like a forgotten tale. O brother, crownèd among men—O chief In glory as in grief! O throned by sorrow over time and fate And the blind strength of hate! From soul to answering soul The thunder-echoes roll, And truth grows out of suffering still and great. To have done well is victory—to be true Is truest guerdon, though blind hands undo The work begun too late. God gives to each man power by toil to earn An undishonoured grave: The praise that lives on every name in turn He leaves the laurelled slave. We die, but freedom dies not like the power That changes with the many-sided hour. Though trampled under the brute hoofs of crime, She sees thro' tears and blood, Above the stars and in the night of time, The sleepless watch of God; Past fear and pain and errors wide and strange The veil'd years leading wingless-footed Change; Endure, and they shall give Truth and the law whereby men work and live. XVII From Ischia to the loneliest Apennine Time's awful voice is blown; And from her clouded throne Freedom looks out and knows herself divine. From walls that keep in shame Poerio's martyr-name, From wild rocks foul with children's blood, it rings; Their murderers gaze aghast Through all the hideous past, And fate is heavy on the souls of kings. No more their hateful sway Pollutes the equal day, Nor stricken truth pales under its wide wings, Even when the awakened people speaks in wrath, Wrong shall not answer wrong with blind impatience; The bloody slime upon that royal path Makes slippery standing for the feet of nations. Our freedom's bridal robe no wrong shall stain, No lie shall taint her speech: But equal knowledge shall be born of pain, And wisdom shaping each. True leaders shall be with us, nobler laws Shall guide us calmly to the final Cause: And thou, earth's crownless queen, No more shalt wail unseen, But front the weary ages without pain: Time shall bring back for thee The hopes that lead the free, And thy name fill the charmèd world again. The shame that stains thy brow Shall not for ever mark thee to fresh fears: For in the far light of the buried years Shines the undarkened future that shall be A dawn o'er sunless ages. Hearest thou, Italia? tho' deaf sloth hath sealed thine ears, The world has heard thy children—and God hears. LINES [I thought it would be pain to see] I thought it would be pain to see Her face grow thin for love of me, Her lips shut closer and turn grey If words of anger came that way From men that spake harsh things of me. I knew it would be strange to hear In talk or song that voice of her That shook me sleeping as awake, Changed with new music for my sake If I came face to face with her. I thought it would be sweet to know At night, when wind lets the foam blow From grass to sand and rock to weed In bitter flakes that fall like seed, She with shut eyelids feels it blow. I knew it would be sweet to hold And strain between my hands the gold Of her long hair in heavy bands; This one tress left between my hands Seems now too pale to look like gold. ODE TO THE NIGHT Goddess dark bosomed, from thy mystic cave Sounds strange and sad we hear, Unfit for mortal ear! Ever and ever do the bleak winds rave About thy throne, in fits and gusty flaws: Save when thou sittest in thy musing mood With calm eyes full of meditation grave, And from grey memory's secret hoarded stores Callest strange thoughts to ponder on: Beneath thee lies the circling ocean flood, Above thy head is vaulted the deep sky; But thou art still alone— There is a mystery in thine eye! What spirits dost thou commune with, strange queen? Do the unblinded stars in whispers airy Murmur unknown things in thine ear divine? Or do the spirits, that in their cloudy shrine Write fearful warning on the sky serene In letters of red lightning, tell thee all The mysteries of mysteries? In the starry Hollow of thine eternal throne, Where thou dost sit in lone divinity, Thou hearest them one to another call; And fraught with musing all alone Thy curvèd brows are bent with thought Whose treasures were by those strange spirits brought From the inner radiance of the inner sky. O ancient mother of the holy moon, Whose veilèd brows are only bare To kiss thy daughter the chill air, Wert thou in some deep cavern never lighten'd Nor seen of day, but deepening down From depth to airy depth, in chaos lorn Fram'd out of silence, so that when the morn Kissed all things else and made them laugh with light, Thou only wast not brighten'd, But crowned with thine own darkness, mystic night! MEMORIES I know not if the word she said to me Were false or true; I know not if she meant More than my sense could see. Perchance in scorn of mine obscure intent She answered, with no care for pain to be. Now pain is come indeed; and many a year, Like a blown flake of snow, has sunk between These memories and her. No leaf hath motion now that then was green, And sorrow hath forgotten her last tear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[VOL. II] THE TWO KNIGHTS Two knights rode on along the dark, Quietly, without word; By lawn and copse, by pale and park, With hands on rein and sword; And ever one would lean to mark If aught beyond them stirred. The sea had wailed itself to sleep Through cloud and blurrèd fire, The sad moon seemed to shiver and weep Like a thin face; but higher Pure midnight made the stars seem deep Fierce eyes of wide desire. The ragged skirts of flame that mar The sick moon's disk they saw; The trembling splendour of a star Took them with patient awe, And all those glories fair and far Had strength to touch and draw. One looked upon the earth and smiled As his grave lids drew down; The other, earnest as a child, With brows that could not frown, Stared heavenward, till his eyes were filled With star, and shade, and moon. The first spoke slowly; o'er his head A rent plume flickered pale In the vague wind that shook and fled Inward from sea to vale. In a low voice and cold he said: ‘To-day were we to sail. ‘Now the far vessel strains in storm, Stretching to alien isles, And she that looked for me may charm New men with her old wiles; Mine eyes take not her perfect form, My heart her settled smiles.’ Then spake the other; bare he rode Unhelmed in the sharp night: ‘To-day I tread the path she trod Patiently, out of sight. She went a holy name to God; I walk within her light.’ Said one: ‘Thou wert to sail with me.’ Soft the brief answer fell, As clouds drop rain on the slow sea: ‘I would have served thee well, But love, I knew, was not in thee; And with love should I dwell.’ Here the wind made a sullen rent In the stained cloud, and all The pale fierce moon glared at them, blent With vapour like a pall. The sea's moan woke again; there went Through night a stormy call. The plumed knight turned; in his close hand The bridle strained and shook; He looked across the long low land With a forsaken look; Then flushed his drawn face of command, Pale as a grey sea rock. Never a word he spoke again, But smote the helmless head. Silent as falls the slow, tired rain, The knight fell; then he said: ‘I loved not!’ and his face of pain Grew quiet as the dead. But the knight rose and looked at him: ‘Go, bid them speed thy sail! My heart is sick, my eyes turn dim, I hear the waters wail. Death fills my spirit to the brim With wine of Lethe pale. ‘I hear the soundless steps that fall Far on a golden floor, I hear the voiceless words that call Above us evermore. I climb to enter in where all Have passed in love before. ‘She puts her rose into my hand, Her pure face blesses mine. I tremble; shall I ever stand Where she stands up divine? I tremble in the holy land, I see her forehead shine.’ Then died he. And the sea-birds came Nor rent him, lying there, In white robes by the taper's flame, They robed the dead limbs fair. Then passed and found his face the same, Upturned, white and bare, In virginal white robes set round With fringe and crimson hem. On the bare head that took the wound They set his diadem, And watched him, weeping without sound. He seemed to smile at them. His face shone like a flame; all knew The wonderful dead face. So was he buried where the dew Falls thick in a green place, Planted with flowers purple and blue. Christ took him into grace. THE DREAMER Glad, but not flushed with gladness,— Since joys go by; Sad, but not bent with sadness,— Since sorrows die; Faint in the gleaming glass She sees all past things pass, And all sweet life that was, Lie down and die. And glowing ghosts of flowers Draw down, draw nigh, And wings of swift dead hours Take flight and fly; And seeing she hears what seems Lulled sounds of straying streams, Dead mouths of many dreams That sing and sigh. A painted dream, beholden Of no man's eye, Framed in far memories, golden As hope when nigh Holds fast her soul that hears Faint waters flow like tears By shores no sunbeam cheers From all the sky. Face fallen and white throat lifted With sleepless eye, She sees old loves that drifted Sink low, soar high. Old loves and faded fears Float down a shore that hears The flowing of all men's tears Beneath the sky. THE RIDE FROM MILAN As we rode into the day, riding silent all the way, Through the dark a pulse of grey throbbed and ran; Till a sunrise white and lowly smote athwart the shadows holy As we rode on, riding slowly from Milan. Then we saw their eagles glisten—saw the gloom recede and lessen, Paused as one might pause to listen what were said— Saw the white points burn together, saw the Devil's colours gather, In a pause of thunderous weather overhead. Black with doubtful fluctuation shone the streamen from their station, In a sullen hesitation of the light; Under these the grey mass thickened; and our eyes with wrath were quickened, And our hands with hatred sickened at the sight. Face to silent face was turned, hands against the sword-hilt yearned, All the breathless anger burned in a smile, As we stood up face to face, as we stood up race by race, In that bloodless battle-place for a while. Ah, but soon we smiled no longer; soon our hearts felt hard and stronger, With the blind and murderous hunger that they knew; There was just a pause to wonder—there was noise of iron and thunder— Then the ranks were rent in sunder as it flew. For the cannon solemn-lipped spake in tones that rose and dipt, Rose and dipt through clouds they ripped into smoke; And before us all the field like a stormy water ruled, While the grave slow thunder peeled as it spoke. Close our dear three colours drew; deeper all the battle grew; Face to face we smote and slew, man by man; And the sullen palpitation of a live and trampled nation On from station into station throbbed and ran. Straight upon them next we sallied, mute as wrath and somewhat pallid, As their long lines broke and rallied far away; Hands grew tighter, lips grew whiter, till the press seemed slowly lighter, As the cannon's mouth burnt brighter through the day. Then our hearts began to thicken for our brothers that were stricken, And the wrath began to quicken into pain, For the holy limbs downtrodden, for the grasses red and sodden, Where the feet of death had trodden in the plain. Vain were horse and rider then, vain the might of many men, For the place was as a fen—wet and red; And the faces heaped beneath could not turn to cry or breathe, For the close, dim weight of death overhead. All the blind war, like a devil, seemed to mutter through his revel, Seemed to mutter words of evil very low, As the cannon paused for breath in its middle speech of death, And more vague the noise beneath seemed to grow. Not one word of hope was spoken; eye to lighted eye gave token, Till the grey great mass was broken with our steeds; And the set wrath seemed to utter in a vague and weighty mutter, Fainter than a hurt bird's flutter when it bleeds. Then for one red hour we heard stroke of steel nor spoken word, Beat of hoof nor blow of sword as it sunk, But an anger half divine deepened on from line to line, And a thirst for blood-red wine to be drunk. Ever as we strove and smote till the dense dead air grew hot, The flat smoke would flow and float overhead; Till a blind black weight of weather right above began to gather, And the banners blown together seemed of red. As an eagle reeleth smitten through the vapours thunder-litten, Reeled their army, blind and smitten with great fear; Far to northward went the clangour of their trumpets in their anger, Till the wail died into languor thin and clear. Ho, ro, Austrians! was this hidden, that ye stand so white and chidden? To this pledge of ours was bidden prince and priest; Each grand name your blazons carry where the Devil's colours marry, Ho, our masters! will ye tarry for the feast? As we rode into the night, red with respite of the fight, Through the dark a line of white leapt and ran; Every heart was softened wholly, every lip with praise made holy, As we rode back very slowly to Milan. THE ITALIAN MOTHER Is there any to weep for the dead, For the dead that are glorious and slain? Shall the mother be sad for her son, Or the bride for the bridegroom's head That her eyes shall embrace not again? There is none to lament, not one. O beautiful mother of men, Have we seen thee indeed rearisen, Thee rent by the Austrian rods, From the depth of the wild beast's den, From the place of the spirits in prison, O mother of men like gods? O happy beyond all praise, O noble beyond all fame, Of whom it shall alway be said That none to the end of days, Shall glorify Italy's name And not the names of her dead. Yea, glad beyond word of mine, Yea, proud beyond word, O brothers, The lowest and least of you all. His memory shall warm as wine The spirit and sense of the others, Shall ring as a clarion's call. Forgotten the name, the place, Forgotten the mortal hour, The pang, and the fugitive breath; The mother's withering face Bowed low like a broken flower, At the sound of the last son's death. Forgotten the eyes of the bride That the news left wan, not wet, Till awhile they relaxed in tears. And again grew goodly with pride; But thee she will not forget, Thy mother, in all these years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[VOL. III] AFTER MANY DAYS As though the billows of the breaking years Rolled back reversed, And sounds and sights came back on eyes and ears Unknown since first Youth quenched at fountains bright as angels' tears His great glad thirst, Deep drinking down dreams of transfigured grief And figured joy, And gave his heart up as a shaken leaf, The first wind's toy, To the first wind of song, with all belief That fires a boy, Whom hope and passionate wonder and delight Thrill as they throng Confused and consummated; so to-night Before the strong Bright wind of memory wakening with the bright Keen sound of song My spirit spreads full sail to take again That old sweet sense, Which yet is strange and is not: now as then, For all the dense Years interposed with change of times and men And things passed hence, I know the joy known first when years were less By full a score, And find the same song's very loveliness Beloved before As bright and sweet and fit for praise to bless As then of yore. No praise may give sweet song a blessing worth The gifts it gives, Joy, passion, pity brighter-eyed than mirth, Whose heart forgives The painless pain that seems not born of earth Where scarce it lives, The soft swift pang that hurts not; these the years, Change not nor slay: The same sense gathers what the same soul hears The same song say, As though the day when first it thrilled our ears Were yesterday. May 23, 1881. LORD SOULIS Lord Soulis is a keen wizard, A wizard mickle of lear: Who cometh in bond of Lord Soulis, Thereof he hath little cheer. He has three braw castles to his hand, That wizard mickle of age; The first of Estness, the last of Westness, The middle of Hermitage. He has three fair mays into his hand, The least is good to see; The first is Annet, the second is Janet, The third is Marjorie. The firsten o' them has a gowden crown, The neist has a gowden ring; The third has sma' gowd her about, She has a sweeter thing. The firsten o' them has a rose her on, The neist has a marigold; The third of them has a better flower, The best that springeth ower wold. The kisses that are her mouth within, There is no man knoweth of any one; She is a pure maid of her body, The best that standeth under sun. And Estness was a bonny castle, It stood upon a sea; The green for Annet, the yellow for Janet, The brown for Marjorie. And Westness was a bonny castle, It lay upon a lea; Red wine for Annet, and white for Janet, And water for Marjorie. But Hermitage is a fair castle, The fairest of the three; Saft beds for Annet, silk sheets for Janet, Nane sheets for Marjorie. He made them a' by strong cunning, That wizard great of hand; The twain to fall at his life's ending, The third alway to stand. He made them a' by hell's cunning, That wizard full of ill; They burnt up Estness and cast down Westness, But Hermitage standeth still. There be twenty lords in that border, Full twenty strong lords and three, They have sworn an oath for Lord Soulis, Weel wroken of him to be. They have set a meeting at Emmethaugh, And upon the Lilienshaw, They will be wroken of Lord Soulis, His body to hang and draw. They have broken bread between them a' At Ottershawe that's ower the lea, They wad plunder Estness and harry Westness, But Hermitage they let be. They watered steeds by the wan Wellhaugh Under the sweet leaves green; Frae the Yethburn head to Christenbury, To ride they were full keen. When they were come to the Yethburn spait, I wot their knees were wet; When they were come to the Yethburn head, There was no porter at tha yett. When they had won to the Bloody-bush, I wot their sides were sair: Before they were well upon that border They had mickle sorrow and care. ‘O gin we were at the sweet Wellhaugh, Under the merry leaves fair!’ Before they were well on the other side He set a sair cast them between— ‘O gin we were by the Emmetburn Under the little leaves green, Between the birks and the Emmet water, We had the better been.’ When they came on that weary border, He sent an ill thing them amang; ‘We winna ride ower to Hermitage, The wa's they are too strang; But we will ride to the low castles, Though the ways be ill to gang.’ Out then spak Burd Marjorie's lover, He was a fair man of his face; ‘Gin I may be wroken of Lord Soulis I have sma' care of my place; ‘Gin I may be wroken of Lord Soulis I have sma' care of ony thing; Of the wine for shedding, the sheets for wedding, The kirk for christening. ‘I have sma' care of my sad body Upon the ground to gang; Gin I wist where I might be wroken of him I wad give it to him strang.’ Out then spak may Janet's brother, He was a stout knight and a keen; ‘He has sent his devils us amang To work us trouble and teen. ‘Gin I wist where I might be wroken of him, Betwixen dark and day, I wad give baith my soul and body To hell to fetch away.’ Out then spak Burd Annet's father, He was a good man full of age; ‘Ye'll speir at Estness, ye'll speir at Westness, But no at Hermitage.’ They turned their horse-heads round about, Rode low down by the sand; And a' the way they went upon, The devil went at their hand. The first castle they came to, It stood upon a sea; The least worth chamber in a' that castle, It was a' whalestooth and sandal-tree. ‘O whatten a may is yonder may, Sae fair to see upon?’ ‘O yonder is my daughter Annet, Out of my ha's was gone. ‘Gin ye'll come hither to me, Annet, God's grace of me ye 'se have.’ ‘I wadna gang out, my auld fool father, Gin ye were graithed in your grave.’ ‘Give me three kisses, my daughter Annet, Before my mouth is cold.’ ‘I winna come forth for nae man's grey beard, Till my bairn be a sennight old.’ He turned his face against the sea, His heart brak right atwain; ‘The fire of hell for your body, Annet, Ere ye behold me again.’ ‘Pull off the green, and the goodly green, Put on the black, the black, For my father is ridden to Wearyland, I doubt he'll never win back.’ They turned their horse-heads round about, Rode high upon a hill; And a' the gate they gaed about, The devil them garred gang ill. The neister castle they came to, It was hard upon the low champaign; The least worth bower in a' that castle, It was a' white siller and green stane. ‘O whatten a may is yonder may That is sae great of her body?’ ‘O yonder is my sister Janet, Was stolen by night frae me. ‘Gin ye'll come hither to me, Janet, God's love of me ye 'se hae.’ ‘I wadna gang out for aye, brither, Though ye were dead the day.’ ‘O ye'll gang down to me, Janet, For God's sweet mercy and mine; For I have sought ye the lang lands ower, These eight months wearing nine.’ ‘I winna gang forth for nae brither, Though his body should be lorn; I winna gang forth for nae man's face, Till Lord Soulis' bairn be born.’ He turned his face against the brigg, His heart brak right in three; ‘The sorrow of hell for you, Janet, And the warld's sorrow for me.’ ‘Take down the red, and the bonny red, Set up the black, the black: For my brother is ridden to Wearieswood, I wot he'll never win back.’ They turned their horse-heads round about, Rode back a day and twain: And a' the rivers they rode upon The devil rode at their rein. The third castle they came to, It was the castle of Hermitage; There is nae man may break the sides of it, Though the stanes therein are great of age. ‘O whatten a may is yonder may, That looks like ony flower?’ ‘O yon is my very love, Marjorie, Was borne out of my bower.’ The bower Lady Marjorie was in, It had neither white cloths nor red, There were nae rushes to the bower floors, And nae pillows to the bed. ‘O will ye come down but a very little, For God's sake or for me? Or will ye kiss me a very little, But six poor kisses and three?’ She's leaned hersell to that window, For sorrow she couldna stand; She's bound her body by that window, With iron at her hand. She's sworn by tree and by tree's leaf, By aits and rye and corn, ‘Gin ye hadna come the night,’ she says, ‘I had been but dead the morn.’ She's kissed him under the bower-bar Nine goodly times and ten; And forth is come that keen wizard In the middest of his men. And forth is come that foul wizard, God give him a curse and care! Says ‘the life is one time sweet to have And the death is three times sair.’ Forth is come that strong wizard, God give him a heavy day! Says ‘ye shall have joy of your leman's body When April cometh after May.’ Between the hill and the wan water In fields that were full sweet, There was riding and running together, And many a man gat red-shod feet. Between the wa's and the Hermitage water, In ways that were waxen red, There was cleaving of caps and shearing of jack, And many a good man was there dead. They have taken that strong wizard To bind him by the hands: The links of airn brast off his body Like splints of bursten birken wands. And they have taken that keen wizard To bind him by the hause-bane; The links of airn brast off his body As blossom that is burst wi' rain. And they have taken that foul wizard To bind him by the feet: The links of airn brast off his body As berries that are burst with heat. They have putten fire upon his flesh, For nae fire wad it shrink: They have casten his body in the wan well-head, For nae water wad it sink. Up then gat the fiend Borolallie, Bade them ‘Give ower and let be: Between warld's fire and warld's water He gat a gift of me; Till fire come out of wan water, There's nane shall gar him dee.’ ‘A rede, a rede, thou foul Borolallie, A good rede out of hand; Shall we be wroken of Lord Soulis By water or by land? Or shall we be wroken a great way off, Or even whereas we stand?’ And up it spak him, foul Borolallie, Between the tree and the leaf o' the tree, ‘Ye maunna be wroken of Lord Soulis By land neither by sea; Between red fire and wan water Weel wroken ye shall be.’ And up it spak him, foul Borolallie, Between Lord Soulis and them a': ‘Ye maunna be wroken of Lord Soulis Betwixen house and ha'; But ye maun take him to the Ninestane rigs And take his life awa'.’ They have taken him to the Ninestane rigs His foul body to slay; Between the whins and the whinstanes He had a weary way. They have taken him to the Ninestane rigs His foul body to spill: Between the green broom and the yellow He gat a bitter ill. They had a sair cast with his foul body, There was nae man wist what to do; ‘And O gin his body were weel sodden, Weel sodden and suppit in broo!’ And out it spak him, foul Borolallie, Says ‘whatten a coil's this coil? Ye'll mak a fire on the Ninestane rigs, For a pot thereon to boil.’ And out it spak him, foul Borolallie, Says ‘whatten a din's this din? Ye'll boil his body within the brass, The brass to boil him in.’ They boiled his body on the Ninestane rigs That wizard mickle of lear; They have sodden the bones of his body, To be their better cheer. They buried his bones on the Ninestane rigs But the flesh was a' clean gane; There was great joy in a' that border That Lord Soulis was well slain. LORD SCALES Lord Randal lay in low prison, He looked against the wa'; ‘Gin the big wa' stanes were linen bands, I'd win weel through them a'.’ Lord Randal sat by a low lattice, He looked against the sea; ‘Gin the foul bed straws were bonny ships, I wot weel wad I be.’ Lord Randal stood by a strang window He looked against his hand; ‘Gin my twa wrist chains were hempen threads, I'd win weel to the sand.’ ‘Ye'll take the rings frae my fingers, The silk knot frae my hair: Ye'll gie them to the bonny knight That cries on me sae sair. ‘Ye'll take the gowd bands frae my back, The covers frae my bed: Ye'll gie them to the Lord Randal, To put beneath his head. ‘Hae silk into your hands, Randal, And gowd twine to your feet: And braw pillows about your head To keep your lang hair sweet. ‘For the rain rins through the rank bed straw, And the wet drips in the wa'; And the wee red worms in this prison Wad gar your gowd hair fa'.’ ‘I had liefer hae my ain twa hands, And keep my body cold; I had liefer hae my own twa feet Than twa sic shoon of gold. ‘But I had liefer hae my lady's mouth Than the silk and the siller bands; But I had liefer hae her sweet body Than a' the gowd in land. ‘I had liefer kiss my lady dead Than a live woman should kiss me: I had liefer hae my lady dead Than a fair woman's live body.’ ‘O ye 'se hae twine o' gowd for hemp, And twine o' silk for thread; And ye shall hae her fair body, But no' her body dead.’ She's loosed the knot upon his back, The knot upon his throat: She's clad him with a suit of samite, And red silk to his coat. She's washed him well wi' sweet waters, Put spice into his hair; She's set his feet in a narrow side chamber, Upon a sideway stair. He's ta'en him to her, Lady Helen, Where she sat by a bed, The least cloth upon her body, It was of the noble red. The insides of her bed curtains, The gold was gone them through; The outsides of her bed curtains, They were full merry and blue. The silk side of her bed pillows, It was of the summer green; The gold was bound in her gold hair, That now should tell them twa between. ‘O came ye for my lord's land, Or for my lord's fee; Or came ye for my lord's hate, Or yet for the love of me? ‘O gin ye come like a land robber, Full soon shall ye hang; But gin ye come like a woman's lover, Full sweetly ye shall gang.’ ‘O it was never for no hate, For lord's love nor for fee: But a' the weird that is me on It was a' for your body.’ ‘Gin ye set nae scorn by me, Randal, To dree a weird and a pain, It's no Lord Scales my auld husband That shall depart us twain. ‘Gin this be sooth of you, Randal, That ye have good will to play; It's no Lord Scales my auld husband Shall be better of us twey. ‘For I hae reapers to the land, And sailors to the sea; And I hae maidens to my bower That wait by three and three; And it's no Lord Scales my auld husband Shall part my will and me. ‘The first draw rapes upon the ship Between the sea and the sea sand; The neist they lie in the lang corn, Wi' the reaphooks to their hand; And between the lang beds and the wa', It's there the maidens stand.’ She's had him to her bonnie bed, She's laid it warm and wide; He's clipped that lady by the middle waist, And by the middle side. There was neither light nor fire them by, And they twain were set to sleep, When she's turned her chin to the pillow side Made her a space to weep. He kissed her on her fair twa breasts, And hard upon her chin; He's kissed her by her white halse-bane The little salt tears fell in. The small tears fell about her face Between her lips and his; From side to side of her gold hair Her face was full sad to kiss. ‘Lie down, lie down now, Lady Helen, Lie still into my hand; I wadna gie ane o' the pillow-beres For ten measures of land. ‘Lie still into mine arms, Helen, Betwixen sheet and sheet: I wadna gie ane o' the cods of silk For ten measures of wheat. ‘Lie still into mine arms, Helen, The gold side of the bed; I wadna gie ane o' thy kaims o' lammer For the gold on the queen's head.’ ‘It's I lie saft the night, Randal, With my head against your face; But gin ye had slept in my stables, It had been the sweeter place. ‘It's I lie saft the night, Randal, But ye'll lie hard the morn; For I hear a mouse rin by the straw, And a bird rin by the corn.’ ‘O whatten a bird is that, Helen, I wad fain ken what it ails?’ ‘It's an auld bird and an ill, Randal, Gin it be no Lord Scales.’ Then in and came her auld husband, I wot a fu' lean bird was he; ‘It's wake ye or sleep ye now, madame, Ye 'se gar mak room for me.’ ‘O are ye sick the night, Lord Scales, In the head or else the side? Or are ye fain to sleep, Lord Scales, For the fear ye have to ride?’ Randal's taen out her girdle knife, He's stricken him amang his een; It was mair for the lady's love Than it was for his proper teen. Out came a' her bower maidens, In their night smocks and night rails; It was a' for sorrow of their lady, It was naething for Lord Scales. Out came a' her bower maidens, In their sma' coats green and white; With a red rose wrought for the left breast, And a rose wrought for the right. Lord Scales had on a goodly coat, It was a' bound wi' steel thickly; Lord Randal had but a little shirt Between the wind and his body. The first good straik Lord Randal strak, The red blood sprang upon his face; It was mair for his lady's love Than it was for her lord's grace. The neist good straik Lord Randal strak, The bright blood sprang upon his nails; It was mair for love of Lady Helen Than pity of Lord Scales. Lord Scales he strak a fu' straight straik, But Randal strak a sair; Lord Scales had a little joy of it, But Lady Helen had mair. ‘Gar set my ships into the sea And my hooks into the corn; For gin I have lost a man the night, I'll get a man the morn.’ BURD MARGARET ‘O wha will get me wheaten bread And wha will get me wine? And wha will build me a gold cradle To rock this child of mine? ‘There's nane will drink of bitter wine, Nor eat of bitter bread; There's nane will ca' me a clean maiden When my body is dead. ‘Nae silk maun come upon my feet, Nae gowd into my hair; My brothers smite me on the mouth, Where nae man shall kiss mair.’ She held her hands in the wan water Till the fingers were a' red; Her face was like nae fair burd's face That has her maidenhead. She's streekit the water on her hair, She's signed it ower her chin, She's streekit the water on her lips To let the draps gang in. The tears ran through her fair sma' mouth; The white bones small and thin Were waxen sharper in her lang throat, And in her wrist and chin. ‘Gin my mither had wist o' this When she was left wi' me, I wot these arms that are waxen lean Had ne'er gaun round a man's body. ‘Gin my mither had dreamed a dream That sic a kail should fall on me, She had bound me between her smock and her kirtle And cast me ower the sea. ‘She had row'd me between her smock and her kirtle, Left me to swim or sink; And I had drunken o' the saut water Instead of tears to drink. ‘The bairn that is waxen me within, It is waxen a pain to me; But weel lie he and ever weel That made my bairn's body. ‘The white that was in my twa brows, I wot it is waxen red; But weel lie he and ever weel That had my maidenhead. ‘O weel be to the fair red roses Stood high against my chin; But ill be to the good green leaves, For they were half the sin. ‘O weel be to the little bird Sang low against my knee; But ill be to my fause nourice, She had sma' reck of me. ‘O weel be to the fair red roses Stood high against my face; But ill be to the bonny rowan, I wish it never grace.’ Burd Margaret lay in the rank water-grass By the fairest ford in Tyne; And between the grass and the aspen leaf She saw their armour shine. The first of them had fair Milan coats, The second had but pikes and jacks; The third had coats of fair scarlet, And gold across their caps. There were three and three wi' bits of steel, And three and three wi' siller fine, And three and three wi' bits of gold, Was red as fair new wine. ‘Whatten men be these that rin,’ she said, ‘Or whatten men be these that ride? Either ye be thieves frae the north border, Or men that look a bride.’ ‘Gin I be rid frae the north border And my braw bride won south, I'll gar her clip me round the body And kiss me on the mouth.’ ‘I think ye be nae knight,’ she said, ‘Nae knight that wons about; There was never man but a devil That had sae lang a snout. ‘Gin I should kiss your mouth,’ she said, ‘I wis I had kissed a loon; I think ye be some clouted carter, Albeit ye wear steel shoon.’ ‘I am Lord Hugh of Burnieshaw, Ye may weel ken the face o' me; And I wad hae back the bonnie lad bairn That I left here wi' thee.’ ‘Gin ye be Hughie of Burnieshaw, As I trow a better may have been, Tell me what words I said to you, When the rowans were green.’ ‘O first ye pu'd the green berry, And syne ye pu'd the red; And the first word that ever ye spak Was to complain your maidenhead. ‘O first ye pu'd the red hollin, And syne ye pu'd the green: And the first word ye spak to me Ye grat fu' sair between.’ ‘Gin ye be Hughie of Burnieshaw, As I think weel ye'll never be, Here have ye back your bonny lad bairn, That sair has troubled me.’ She's caught her hand to his bridle-rein, Held up her mouth to touch his chin; ‘Ye garred me pu' the girdle straight That the fair knave bairn was in.’ ‘What needs ye flur and mock, Margaret? What needs ye scorn at me? Ye never gat harm of your fause brothers, But ye gat aye the mair gude o' me.’ He's put his hands to her body, He's laid her thwart his selle; And ye that hae gotten a bonny sister Gar keep the neist yoursell. Aye they rode weel, and aye better, Until the moon was nigh to sheen; And aye the tears ran in her breast, And aye in the gold between. ‘O whether is yon a cry of corbies, Or men that cry on me?’ ‘Bide still, bide still now, Burd Margaret, For ye hear nothing but the sea.’ ‘O whatten is yonder noise,’ she said, ‘That I hear cry on us behind?’ ‘Haud ye by my sleeve now, Burd Margaret, For ye hear naething but the wind.’ Aye they rode weel, and aye better, Until the moon was waxen weak; And aye she laid her face to his, And her tears ran by his cheek. Aye when he kissed her bonny een, I wot they grat fu' sair; Aye when she laid her head to his, I wot the tears ran through his hair. Aye they rode slow, and aye slower, Till the moon's time was a' done Between the road and the saddle She thought to bear a son. There she saw her first brother, Stood back to a fair tree; Said ‘Grace go with our bonny sister To ride in sic a companie.’ Said ‘Grace go with our bonny sister, To wear her gown aside; It is not meet for a good woman To set her girdle wide.’ He's stricken the first across the neck, Shorn clean his beard and hair; ‘How haud ye weel, my fair brother, Ye 'se get of me nae mair.’ He's cloven the second through the chin, The third upon the knee; ‘Now haud ye weel, my three brothers, Ye 'se get nae mair of me.’ They set her in a fair bride-bed, Full glad she was the morn; And between the silk and the braw geld claith The fair knave bairn was born. THE WORM OF SPINDLESTONHEUGH Lady Helen sat in Spindlestonheugh With gold across her hair; For every plait was on her head, I wot a gold piece was there. Lady Helen sat in Spindlestonheugh With gold across her head; The green gown on her fair body Was woven with gold thread. Lady Helen sat in Spindlestonheugh Wi' silk below her breast; The best pearl in the queen's girdle Was lesser than her least. Lady Helen sat in Spindlestonheugh With silk upon her feet; The seams were sewn wi' cloth of scarlet To keep them frae the weet. ‘O wha will keep the keys for me Until the lord be hame? Or wha will ca' his kye for me, To see gin ony be lame?’ She hadna bided a month but three With silk bands to her side, When word is come to Lady Helen To meet her father's ae new bride. ‘Ye'll bring the owsen and the sheep to stall, Ye'll bring the kye to stand; Ye'll set the first key in my girdle, The neist key at my hand.’ ‘But gin he has wedded a witch woman To work sic teen on me, I'll come nae mair to Spindlestonheugh Till green grow in a dry tree.’ And she's done on her braw girdle, Between the sun and moon; And she's done on her kaims of gold, Her gold gown and her shoon. She's tied her hair in three witch knots, I wot, abune her bonny een; And for her hair and her body, I wot she might have been a queen. ‘I wish the sickle was in the rye, And the rye was ower my head; And aye the next rose I shall gather, I wish the white may be the red.’ She's tane the keys intil her hands Between the red sun and the moon; The rain ran down upon the grass, And stained in her silk shoon. She's tane the keys to her girdle-tie Between the warm sun and the weet; The rain that was between the grass and rye Ran down upon her feet. ‘O whatten a burd is yonder burd That shines about her head?’ ‘It is but Helen my ae daughter Has clad hersell wi' red.’ ‘O where gat she thae stones of price, The warst might serve a queen?’ ‘It is but for the summer season She's clad hersell wi' green.’ Lady Helen knelt upon her knees, She knelt upon her yellow hair; ‘Hae back your keys, my dear father, God give you weel to fare.’ Lady Helen knelt into the dust, She knelt upon the roadway stane; ‘And God you keep, madame, my mither, As I shall be your ain.’ Out then spak the new-come bride, I wot she spak wi' pain and care; ‘O some hae gold to weave, Helen, And some hae gold to wear.’ Out then spak the witch-mother, I wot she spak fu' little worth; ‘Look where my saddle sits, Helen, Ye'll stand against the saddle-girth.’ She's tane the red kaims frae her hair, The red shoon frae her feet; She's set her face to the saddle-stirrup, That nane should hear her greet. And aye she ran, and weel she ran Till her sides were waxen sair; And the sun that was upon the ways Had burnt her through her hair. They hadna ridden a mile but three When she was fain to bide; For the blood was come upon her feet And the pain upon her side. And whiles she ran, and whiles she grat, In the warm sun and the cold, Till they came to the bonny castle Was bigged upon with gold. ‘O see ye not thae towers, Helen, Where ye gat meat and wine? It's I maun ligg in the braw bride-chamber, And ye maun ligg wi' swine. ‘O see ye not thae halls, Helen, Where ye gat silk to wear? It's I shall hae the gold gowns on, When your body is bare.’ ‘O ye'll sit in the braw guest-chamber, And ye'll drink white and red; But ye'll gar them gie me the washing water, The meats and the broken bread?’ ‘Ye'll get nae chine o' the broken loaves, The white bread wi' the brown; Ye'll drink of the rain and the puddle water My maids shall cast ye down.’ ‘O ye'll sit in the braw guest-chamber Wi' the gowd braids on your hair; But ye'll gie me a poor coat and a smock For my body to wear? ‘O I shall ligg i' the trodden straw, And ye in a gold bride-bed; But ye'll gie me a claith to hap my feet, And a claith to hap my head?’ ‘Ye'll get no claith to hap you in, Ye'll get no coats of me; Ye'll get nae mair but a riven smock To wear on your body.’ And she's ate of the foul swine's meat With her saft lips and fine; She's put her mouth to the rank water, Was poured amang the swine. Never ae word spak Lady Helen, Never ae word but twa; ‘O gin my mither had hands to help, I wad be weel holpen awa'.’ Never ae word spak Lady Helen, Never ae word but three; ‘O gin my mither had lips to kiss, Sae weel she wad kiss me! ‘She wad kiss me on my ravelled hair, The foul cheek and the chin; She wad kiss me on the weary mouth, Where the rank water gaed in.’ Out then came the witch-mother: ‘What ails ye now to greet? Here's grass to hap ye dry, Helen, And straw to hap ye sweet.’ The rain fell frae her feet and hands, Frae her lang hair and fine: ‘What ails ye at the baked meats, Helen, The brown wheat bread and the wine?’ She's turned her by the waist about, She's turned her by the knee; She's witched her body to a laidley worm, A laidley worm to be. ‘The red fruit shall grow in green river water, And green grass in the wet sea, Ere ye shall come to a fair woman, A fair woman to be.’ And she's garr'd bigg her seven swine-trows, She's made them wide and lang; She's tane the kail and the meal pocks That the foul worm might feed amang. Aye she roupit and aye she croupit And aye she soupit the mair; And for the breath of her laidley mouth The sweet land stank fu' sair. Word is come to Lady Helen's brother, In God's town where he lay, His father had gatten a braw new bride And his sister was stown away. Word is come to Lord Richard, Where he was in God's land, There were nine men out of the north Would fain be to his hand. ‘Whatten word is this, ye good sailors, This word ye hae to me? Gin it be a word of the good land, A dear word it maun be.’ ‘O there is a worm in Spindlestonheugh, A laidley worm to see; It has the tongue of a maid-woman, And a worm's foul body. ‘For nine mile out of Spindlestonheugh Of grass and rye there is nae routh; There is sma' routh of the good red corn, For the breath of her rank mouth.’ ‘Whatten word is this, ye carlish caitives? For this word ye hae to me, There shall never meat come in my mouth Till I be put to sea.’ And he's garr'd bigg him a fu' fair ship, He's biggit it a' of the rowan tree; It was neither hasped wi' gowd nor airn, To haud it frae the sea. It was neither hasped wi' gowd nor airn, Nor yet wi' siller wan; But a' the wood it was biggit wi' Was of the white rowan. And they sailed lang, and they sailed sair, And they drave ower to south; And a wind was in the ship's side, And a wind in the ship's mouth. And when he came by Spindlestonheugh He's tane the vervein in his hand; ‘Now God have heed of the fair ship, For we must row to land.’ ‘Have pity of us, O Lord Richard, For we dare no further gang.’ ‘Gin I may come by a goodly gallows, The best of ye a' shall hang.’ But when he saw the seven swine-trows, He weened a sair thing to have seen; And when he saw the laidley worm, The tears brast ower in his een. ‘O gin ye'll kiss my laidley mouth For the love of God's body, I winna do ye scaith, brother, Though I be a foul thing to see.’ He's put his mouth to her laidley mouth, He's kissed her once and twice; ‘I had liever lose God's dear body Than kiss this foul worm thrice.’ He's put his mouth to her laidley mouth, He's kissed her kisses three; The flesh fell frae her laidley mouth And frae her rank body; And it was but his sister Helen Stood at Lord Richard's knee. She was clad all in the fair red samite, Her mouth was red and fair; There was nae burd in the good land That had such yellow hair. He's tane him to the witch-mother That sat by her bairn's bed; The gold was gone in her grey hair, Her face was heavy and red. ‘O wae be wi' you, ye ill woman, And the young bairn at your knee; There's never a bairn shall die abed That comes of your body.’ ‘Now God you save, my fair brother, For his dear body that was dead; Now God you save and maiden Mary, That kept me of her maidenhead.’ DURIESDYKE The rain rains sair on Duriesdyke, Both the winter through and the spring; And she that will gang to get broom thereby She shall get an ill thing. The rain rains sair on Duriesdyke, Both the winter and the summer day; And he that will steek his sheep thereby He shall go sadly away. ‘Between Crossmuir and Duriesdyke The fieldhead is full green; The shaws are thick in the fair summer, And three well-heads between. ‘Flower of broom is a fair flower, And heather is good to play.’ O she went merry to Duriesdyke, But she came heavy away. ‘It's I have served you, Burd Maisry, These three months through and mair; And the little ae kiss I gat of you, It pains me aye and sair. ‘This is the time of heather-blowing, And that was syne in the spring; And the little ae leaf comes aye to red, And the corn to harvesting.’ The first kiss their twa mouths had, Sae fain she was to greet; The neist kiss their twa mouths had, I wot she laughed fu' sweet. ‘Cover my head with a silken hood, My feet with a yellow claith; For to stain my body wi' the dyke-water, God wot I were fu' laith.’ He's happit her head about wi' silk, Her feet with a gowden claith; The red sendal that was of price, He's laid between them baith. The grass was low by Duriesdyke, The high heather was red; And between the grass and the high heather, He's tane her maidenhead. They did not kiss in a noble house, Nor yet in a lordly bed; But their mouths kissed in the high heather, Between the green side and the red. ‘I have three sailing ships, Maisry, For red wheat and for wine; The maintopmast is a bonny mast, Three furlongs off to shine. ‘The foremast shines like new lammer, The mizzenmast like steel: Gin ye wad sail wi' me, Maisry, The warst should carry ye weel.’ ‘Gin I should sail wi' you, Lord John, Out under the rocks red, It's wha wad be my mither's bower-maiden To hap saft her feet in bed? ‘Gin I should sail wi' you, Lord John, Out under the rocks white, There's nane wad do her a very little ease To hap her left and right.’ It fell upon the midwinter, She gat mickle scaith and blame; She's bowed hersell by the white water To see his ships come hame. She's leaned hersell against the wind, To see upon the middle tide; The faem was fallen in the running wind, The wind was fallen in the waves wide. ‘There's nae moon by the white water To do me ony good the day; And but this wind a little slacken, They shall have a sair seaway. ‘O stir not for this neid, baby, O stir not at my side; Ye'll have the better birth, baby, Gin ye wad but a little abide.’ WESTLAND WELL ‘Ye maun mak' me a scarlet gown, Lord John, A scarlet gown to the knee; It maun be sewn wi' a gowd needle, To mak' fit wear to me. ‘It maun be sewn wi' a gowd needle, And spun o' silk for thread; And ye maun gie me a band of silk, To tie upon my head. And ye maun gie me a sheet of silk To put into my bed.’ ‘O wha was 't made ye proud, Janet, Or ever ye were born? There's nae gowd in the land, Janet, Is redder than the corn. ‘O wha was 't taught you words, Janet, Or wha was 't learned you pride? There's mony a better face than yours Would fain lie neist my side.’ ‘O haud your tongue, Lord John o' the Mains, I doubt ye hae drunken wine; There is not a maid that wons in heaven Wi' sic a face as mine. ‘Gin I were set in the high heaven, And God's mother were set below, I wad be queen of the high heaven, And she wad be let go.’ When she cam in Lord John's bower, She never had kissed man: When she cam frae Lord John's bower She was but his leman. ‘O ye'll gar mak' me a bonny bed, Ye'll make it warm and sweet, Ye'll set a pillow to my head, mither, And a pillow to my feet.’ It fell about the middle May time When the apple flowers wax red, Her mither began to chide with her She kept sae lang abed. ‘I canna stand to walk, mither, But I'm just like to die, And wae be to your bonny bloodhound That bit me by the knee. ‘Yestreen my maids took off the sheet To wash i' the Westland Well, And lest the bonny web suld ravel, I set a hand mysell. ‘We washed the blue thread and the brown, The white thread and the black; And sae cam ben your fause bloodhound, And bit me in the back. ‘Sae sair it rent and bit, mither, Sae sair it bit and clang, And ever I hope in God, mither, Ye'll gar that bloodhound hang.’ ‘What's this o't now, maiden Janet? What's this o't now?’ quo' she; ‘There's nae such hound that bites women, There's nae such langs to me. ‘Tell me now, Janet,’ she says, ‘And I winna gar ye lee, Is this a hound's tooth or a child's shaping That mars your straight body? ‘O where your cheek was red, Janet, Your cheek is sick and wan; And where your back was right and flat, It bows like a loaden man. ‘O where your throat was round, Janet, It's lean and loose by this; And where your lip was sweet, Janet, It's grown too thin to kiss.’ The blood sprang in her cheek, fair Janet, The blood sprang in her chin; ‘I doubt there's ane wad kiss me, mither, Though I be sick and thin.’ About the time of moon-rising They set her saft in bed, About the time of star-setting They streekit her for dead. ‘O ill be in your meat, Lord John, And ill be in your wine; Gin the bairn be none of your getting, I'm sure it's none of mine. ‘Ill be in your bed, Lord John, And ill be in your way, Gin ye had been hangit a year agone, I had been the merrier May.’ EARL ROBERT ‘O some ride east and some ride north, And some ride west and south; But the ae best gate that ever I rade Was a' for her red mouth. ‘O some wear blue and bonny scarlet, And some wear green and red; And it's a' for love of her yellow hair I'll wear but golden thread.’ ‘Gin this be Annie of Waterswa' That gars ye speak sae hie, There's nae man of your name, Earl Robert, Shall get her fair body.’ O then he came by Waterswa', The rain was sair and strang; Fair Annie sat in a bower-window, And her gold hair was grown lang. ‘Gin I might swim to ye, Robert, I wad never spare for gloves or gown; I wad never spare for the cold water, But I have sore fear to drown.’ ‘Now God thee hold, thou fair Annie, The wa's are hard to leap; The water is ill to swim, Annie, And the brigg is ill to keep.’ ‘Gin I should open to ye, Robert, I wis it were open shame: It were great pity of me, Robert, For I gang but sick and lame. ‘O twice I cuttit the silk string through That was upon my back; And twice I cuttit the gown away That wadna haud me slack. ‘It's ill wi' me the night, Robert, It's weel wi' my leman; For the wine that comes in my fingers, I spill it on my han'; And the meat that's in my very mouth, I wot it feeds a man.’ ‘Gin I may win to ye, Annie, I think ye'll keep me weel.’ ‘I were the liefer of you, Robert, But for the doors of shut steel.’ ‘Gin I may win to ye, Annie, The tane o' us should weel fare.’ ‘There's three men keep the ways, Robert, Between the gate and the water-stair.’ ‘I wot the night there's deep water, Runs red upon the brim: It's full between the wa's, Annie, This were but ill to swim. ‘There's rain the night in Carrilees, I wot the rain is rank; There be twa fathoms of strang water Between it bank and bank.’ But he's rid out through Carrilees' brow, I wot, baith wet and wan; Annie lay in her chamber-window, She was a glad woman. Between the gate and the water-stair He made him room to stand; The wet ran frae his knees and feet, It ran upon his hand. And he's won through to her chamber, He's kissed her neist the chin: ‘O gin ye'll keep me out, Annie, Is there ony will take me in?’ Up then gat her auld father, Between the wall and her bed feet; ‘Is there ony breath in your lips, Earl Robert, To gar a dead mouth smell sweet?’ He's tane her by the gold girdle, He's garr'd it break atwain; There's nae room here for Earl Robert, The ways are sae fu' o' rain. He's tane a keen sword in his hand, He's set him to the wa'; And the very heart's blood of Earl Robert, I wot he's garr'd it fa'. Out then spak she, fair Annie, At the bed's foot where she lay; ‘There's a time for you the night, father, And a time for us the day. ‘O gin ye dig na deep, father, I wot ye maun dig wide; And set my lord to the nether hand, And my bairn to the green side. ‘Ye'll set my head to his foot, father, That he be neist the sun; For a' that was between us twa, I think it's a' weel done.’ THE KING'S AE SON Quo' the bracken-bush to the wan well-head, ‘O whatten a man is this man dead?’ ‘O this is the King's ae son,’ quo' she, ‘That lies here dead upon my knee.’ ‘What will ye do wi' the King's ae son?’ ‘The little fishes shall feed him on.’ ‘What will ye strew for his body's bed?’ ‘Green stanes aneath his head.’ ‘What will ye gie for his body's grace?’ ‘Green leaves abune his face.’ ‘What will ye do wi' the rings on his hand?’ ‘Hide them ower wi' stane and sand.’ ‘What will ye do wi' the gowd in his hair?’ ‘Hide it ower wi' rushes fair.’ ‘What shall he have when the hill-winds blow?’ ‘Cauld rain and routh of snow.’ ‘What shall he get when the birds fly in?’ ‘Death for sorrow, and sorrow for sin.’ ‘What shall come to his father, the King?’ ‘Long life and a heavy thing.’ ‘What shall come to his mother, the Queen?’ ‘Grey hairs and a bitter teen.’ ‘What to his leman, that garr'd him be slain?’ ‘Hell's pit and hell's pain.’ LADY MAISIE'S BAIRN ‘Gin ye winna cease for the pity of him, O cease for the pity of me; There was never bairn born of a woman Between the sea-wind and the sea, There was never bairn born of a woman That was born so bitterly.’ The ship drove hard upon the wind, I wot it drove full mightily; But the fair gold sides upon the ship They were bursten with the sea. ‘O I am sae fain for you, Lord John, Gin ye be no sae fain; How shall I bear wi' my body, It is sae full of pain? ‘O I am sae fain of your body, Ye are no sae fain of me’; But the sails are riven wi' the wind And the sides are full of sea. O when she saw the sails riven, The sair pain bowed her back; But when she saw the sides bursten, I wot her very heart brak. The wind waxed in the sea between, The rain waxed in the land; Lord John was happéd wi' saut sea-faem, Lady Maisie wi' sea-sand; And the little bairn between them twa That was to her right hand. The rain rains sair on Duriesdyke To the land side and the sea; There was never bairn born of a woman That was born mair bitterly. WEARIESWA' The wind wears ower the Wearieswa' To the right and the left hand; The wind wears ower by the Wearieswa' And under by the sea-sand. Every bolt in Wearieswa' Wi' siller was it sparred; Every gate in Wearieswa' Wi' red gold was it barred. Every window in Wearieswa' It was hasped in nickel keen; Every bower in Wearieswa' It was set wi' rushes clean. There wonneth a woman in the Wearieswa', A strong spell is her upon; He that shall kiss her mouth for love Of his life he is fordone. There is nae man made of a woman As the grass grows and the corn, But gin he have kissed that lady's mouth Of his lips he is forlorn. Lord Robert is ridden to the Wearieswa' Between the low ling and the heather hie; A wind was comen out of Wearieswa' Between the hielands and the sea. ‘O whatten a wind is this weary wind A weary wind to me? It's neither a scart o' the mill-water, Nor yet a wind o' the sea.’ Lady Janet looked ower by a little window, She was fain of any man; For the lack of love that was her in All her body was wan. She's laid her chin out ower the wa' stanes, All her body was weak; The tears fell over in her face wan, Betwixen mouth and cheek. ‘Gin I kissed that lady on her lips, The better man would I be; Gin I kissed that lady on her hands twain 'Twere pain of my body.’ ‘O gin ye should kiss my weary hands Your teen would be fu' sair; And gin ye should kiss my heavy mouth Your teen wad be mickle mair. ‘But ye'll gae down to yon wan water-side, Gar make a ship of ashen tree; And ye maun sail by seven ways Between the faem and the green sea. ‘The first water ye'll sail upon Men call it Wearieswyte; Whoso cometh to that water He shall have little delight. ‘The neist water ye'll sail upon Men call it Wearieswan; Whoso cometh to that water He is nae sicker man. ‘The neist water ye'll sail upon Men call it Weariesway; Whoso cometh to that water He wins the better away. ‘The neist water ye'll sail upon Men call it Wearieswoe; Whoso cometh to that water He shall neither stand nor go. ‘The neist water ye'll sail upon Men call it Weariesween; Whoso cometh to that water Of his body he shall have teen. ‘The neist water ye'll sail upon Men call it Weariesyett; Whoso cometh to that water An ill wonning he shall get. ‘The last water ye'll sail upon Men call it Wearieshead; Whoso cometh to that water It were better for him to be dead. ‘And gin the sair sea scathe you not Nor the sea-worms in the sea, This weary weird that is me upon Ye shall take off from me. ‘And gin the water win you not upon Ye shall have good harbouring, When ye come back to Wearieswa', About the fair birk flowering. ‘And ye maun be yoursell alane And I with a' my men, And ye maun stand low down them amang To see if I shall you ken.’ ‘Gin the wan water win me not upon Between the sea-banks and the sea, Then I'll come back for your sake, Janet,— A token I'll hae wi' me.’ ‘But how shall ye be seen, Hynd Robert, O how shall ye be known, Amang so mony gentlemen That wear the gold alone?’ ‘O where they wear the goodly bright gold I shall wear yellow and black; And a little green hood behind my hair To hang down at my back. ‘But how shall ye be kent, Janet, Or how shall ye be seen, Amang so many goodly ladies That ye maun gang between?’ ‘O where they wear a ring, Robert, I shall wear two and three, And a girdle with a fair white stane, And by that ye shall ken me. ‘And where they wear but yellow lammer, I shall wear siller sheen; And where they gang like a queen's handmaids, I shall gang like a queen. ‘A kell o' gowd abune my head And a band abune my eebree, And in every o' them a jewel stone My witness for to be; ‘And half my kirtle of red sendal To hang down at my knee; And half my kirtle of brown sendal That shall be wrought to me. And the shoon on my feet of yellow samite And by that ye shall me see.’ He's made him a ship o' the goodly ash The sides thereof were wan; The first water he sailed upon He was the heavier man. A' the oars were wrought of gold And a' the sails of red; The last water he sailed upon He seemed he was but dead. But he's won back to Wearieswa' That was hard on a great sea; His hair was fu' of the wan sea-water And he halted of his knee. Between the sea and the sea-banks He's let his bonny ship stand; His clothes were fu' of the wan rain-water And he halted of his hand. ‘O I will draw to me a weed, A weed baith poor and low, And I will gang before my lady's face, To see if she will me know.’ And he has drawn to him a weed A weed of yellow and black; But there was nae hood behind his hair To hang down at his back. The first gate that he came to It was little for his delight; The knappies that were that gate upon They were hewn of siller white. The last gate that he came by It was little for his ease; Before he had well won ower it, The blood ran frae his knees. The neist gate that he came by His comfort was waxen cold; Every bolt that gate within It was carven of red gold. And he's gane up to the high chamber, He's found that lady there, The red sendal on her body, And the red gold in her hair. And as he stood low and very low Amang thae goodly men; He stood amang them hoodless, There was nae man did him ken. And she spied him weel and very weel Gin she might his body see; ‘O wha is yon gangs hoodless, For my love it mauna be.’ And she sought weel and very weel Gin she might him behold; She was mair fain of his fair body Than the rain is of the mould. And a' the men that were her before They were red and nothing wan; And when she saw his goodly face, She weened it was another man. And when she looked his face upon, It was wan and nothing red, And a' his hair was riven wi' rain That rained upon his head. ‘O ye'll take out yon hoodless man, That hirples on the marl; I thought it were my love, Hynd Robert, It is but a hireman carl. ‘And ye'll take out yon gangrel fellow That hirples on the clay; I thought it were my love, Hynd Robert, That has been lang away.’ He's taen him down to yon wan water-stand, The tears fell ower his een; Before he was weel in his goodly ship The wind began to ween. He's turned his face to the fair leeland, He was right fu' o' care; Before he was weel upon the sea, The water was waxen sair. ‘Ye'll cast me in the heavy water That is both green and black, And ye'll bind my feet with a twine of silk; Pray for the storms to slack. ‘Ye'll cast me in the weary water That is both green and grey, And ye'll bind my arms upon my back; Pray for the rains to stay.’ And they've cast over his fair body In the water that was sae white; And they drove over before the wind A day's space and a night. The first wave that cam nigh the ship It smote her in the side; And ever alas! quo' the ae first man, ‘This water is ill to bide!’ The neist wave that cam nigh the ship, It smote her in the head; ‘Haul round, haul round,’ quo' the eldest man, ‘This water maun be our deid!’ And they spied ower the wan sea wide To see gin ony help might be; And there they saw him, Hynd Robert, That fleeted upright in the sea. And they spied out upon the sea, It was a weary water and wan; And there they saw him, Hynd Robert That fleeted as a living man. ‘O whatten a weird is this, Hynd Robert, That is of your body, To fleet out ower in the easterin' wind That thraws upon the sea?’ ‘The wind shall blaw in the wan water, It shall never slack for me, Till ye bring my lady to yon sea-sand, Cast her body in the sea. ‘The wind shall thraw in the wild water; I wot it shall never bide, Till ye bring that lady to yon sea-banks, Cast her body ower the ship's side.’ They've had that lady to yon sea-banks And ower by yon heather hie; They bound her hands before her face, Cast her body in the sea. THE EARL OF MAR'S DAUGHTER It was intill a goodly time, The first morning in May, The bonny Earl of Mar's daughter Went forth hersell to play. She's tane her to the bonny birkenshaw Amang the fair green leaves; There she saw a bonny doo Sat on the leaf o' the tree. ‘O Coo-me-doo, my love sae true, Gin ye'll come down to me, I'll gie ye a cage of good red gowd For a cage of greenshaw tree. ‘Gowden hingers roun' your cage, And siller roun' your wa', I'll gar ye shine as bonny a bird As the bonniest ower them a'.’ She hadna weel these words spoken, Nor yet she hadna said, Till Coo-me-doo flew frae the leaves And lighted on her head. And she's tane hame this bonny bird, Brought him to bower and ha'; She's garred him shine the bonniest bird That was out ower them a'. When day was gane and night was come In ae chamber they were that tide; And there she saw a goodly young man Stood straight up at her side. ‘How cam ye in my bower-chamber, For sair it marvels me, For the bolts are made o' the good red gowd And the door-shafts of a good tree.’ ‘O haud your tongue now, May Janet, And of your talking let me be; Mind ye not on your turtle-doo That ye brought hame wi' ye?’ ‘O whatten a man are ye,’ she said, ‘Fu’ sair this marvels me; I doubt ye are some keen warlock That wons out ower the sea. ‘O come ye here for ills?’ she says, ‘Or come ye for my good? I doubt ye are some strong warlock That wons out ower the flood.’ ‘My mither is lady of strange landis Stand far out ower the sea; She witched me to a birdie's shape For the love of your body. ‘My mither is queen of the witch-landis Lie baith to north and south; She witched me to a birdie's body For the love of your goodly mouth. ‘She can well of witches' work, She maketh baith mirth and meen; She witched me to a little bird's body For the love of your twa grey een. ‘It was a' for your yellow hair That I cam ower the sea; And it was a' for your bonny mouth I took sic weird on me.’ ‘O Coo-me-doo, my love sae true, Nae mair frae me ye 'se gae. The stanes shall fleet on the wan waters Before we twain be twey. ‘O Coo-me-do, my love sae true, It's time we were abed.’ ‘O weel for you, my ain sweet thing, It's be as ye have said.’ Then he's dwelt in her bower-chamber Fu' sax lang years and ane, And seven fair sons she's borne to him, Fairer was there never nane. The first bairn she's borne to him He's tane him ower the sea; He's gien it to his auld mither, Bade well nourished it should be. The seventh bairn she's borne to him, He's tane him frae his make; He's gien it to his auld mither, Bade nourice it for his sake. And he's dwelt in her bower-chamber Fu' six years thro' and three, Till there is comen an auld grey knight Her wed-lord for to be; She had nae will to his gowden gifts Nor wad she to his fee. Out then spak the bonny bird, He heard what they did say; Says: ‘Wae's be to you, ye auld grey man, For it's time I were away.’ Then Coo-me-doo took flight and flew, He flew out ower the sea; He's lighted by his mither's castle-ha' On a tower of gold fu' hie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[VOL. V] POETA LOQUITUR If a person conceives an opinion That my verses are stuff that will wash, Or my Muse has one plume on her pinion, That person's opinion is bosh. My philosophy, politics, free-thought! Are worth not three skips of a flea, And the emptiest of thoughts that can be thought Are mine on the sea. In a maze of monotonous murmur Where reason roves ruined by rhyme, In a voice neither graver nor firmer Than the bells on a fool's cap chime, A party pretentiously pensive, With a Muse that deserves to be skinned, Makes language and metre offensive With rhymes on the wind. A perennial procession of phrases Pranked primly, though pruriently prime, Precipitates preachings on praises In a ruffianly riot of rhyme Through the pressure of print on my pages: But reckless the reader must be Who imagines me one of the sages That steer through Time's sea. Mad mixtures of Frenchified offal With insults to Christendom's creed, Blind blasphemy, schoolboylike scoff, all These blazon me blockhead indeed. I conceive myself obviously some one Whose audience will never be thinned, But the pupil must needs be a rum one Whose teacher is wind. In my poems, with ravishing rapture Storm strikes me and strokes me and stings: But I'm scarcely the bird you might capture Out of doors in the thick of such things. I prefer to be well out of harm's way When tempest makes tremble the tree, And the wind with omnipotent arm-sway Makes soap of the sea. Hanging hard on the rent rags of others, Who before me did better, I try To believe them my sisters and brothers, Though I know what a low lot am I. The mere sight of a church sets me yelping Like a boy that at football is shinned! But the cause must indeed be past helping Whose gospel is wind! All the pale past's red record of history Is dusty with damnable deeds; But the future's mild motherly mystery Peers pure of all crowns and all creeds. Truth dawns on time's resonant ruin, Frank, fulminant, fragrant, and free: And apparently this is the doing Of wind on the sea. Fame flutters in front of pretension Whose flagstaff is flagrantly fine: And it cannot be needful to mention That such beyond question is mine. Some singers indulging in curses, Though sinful, have splendidly sinned: But my would-be maleficent verses Are nothing but wind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[VOL. VI] THE WHITE MAID'S WOOING ‘How will you woo her, This white maid of thine? With breaking of wastel, Or pouring of wine?’ Not with pouring of cups, Or with breaking of bread; But with wood that is cloven, And wine that is red. With rings will I woo her, With chains will I wed; With ships that are broken, With blood that is shed. Not with gold for a ring, Nor with kisses on lips, But with slaying of sailors, And breaking of ships. ‘And how will you tame her, This mad maid of thine? With kisses for seal, Or with gold for a sign?’ With a bit for the mouth, And a ring for the hand; With a neck-chain of foam, Or a waist-chain of sand. With the wind for a seal, And the sun for a sign; And so will I wed her, This white wife of mine. EVENING BY THE SEA It was between the night and day, The trees looked weary—one by one Against the west they seemed to sway, And yet were steady. The sad sun In a sick doubt of colour lay Across the water's belt of dun. On the weak wind scarce flakes of foam There floated, hardly borne at all From the rent edge of water—some Between slack gusts the wind let fall, The white brine could not overcome That pale grass on the southern wall. That evening one could always hear The sharp hiss of the shingle, rent As each wave settled heavier, The same rough way. This noise was blent With many sounds that hurt the air As the salt sea-wind came and went. The wind wailed once and was not. Then The white sea touching its salt edge Dropped in a slow low sigh: again The ripples deepened to the ledge, Across the beach marsh and fen Came a faint smell of rotten sedge. Like a hurt thing that will not die The sea lay moaning; waifs of weed Strove thro' the water painfully Or lay flat, like drenched hair indeed, Rolled over with the pebbles, nigh Low places where the rock-fish feed. GENTLE SPRING WRITTEN FOR A PICTURE BY FREDERICK SANDYS O Virgin Mother! of gentle days and nights, Spring of fresh buds and gentle soft delights, Come, with lips kissed of many an amorous hour, Come, with hands heavy from the fervent flower The fleet first flower that feels the wind and sighs, The tenderer leaf that draws the sun and dies; Light butterflies like flowers alive in the air Circling and crowning thy delicious hair, And many a fruitful flower and floral fruit Born of thy breath and fragrant from thy foot. Thee, Mother, all things born desire, and thee Earth and the fruitless hollows of the sea Praise, and thy tender winds of ungrown wing Fill heaven with murmurs of the sudden spring. AUTUMN ROUNDEL From spring to fall the year makes merry With days to days that chant and call: With hopes to crown and fears to bury With crowns of flowers and flowers for pall, With bloom and song and bird and berry That fill the months with festival From spring to fall. Who knows if ever skies were dreary With shower and cloud and waterfall? While yet the world's good heart is cheery, Who knows if rains will ever brawl? The storm thinks long, the winds wax weary Till winter comes to wind up all From spring to fall. THE CONCERT OF EUROPE Sharp the concert wrought of discord thrills the tune of shame and death, Turk by Christian fenced and fostered, Mecca backed by Nazareth: All the powerless powers, tongue-valiant, breathe but greed's or terror's breath. Though the tide that feels the west wind lift it, wave by widening wave, Wax not yet to height and fullness of the storm that smites to save, None shall bid the flood back seaward till no bar be left to brave. 1st March 1897. IN THE TWILIGHT Lord, is it daytime or night? Failure, Lord, or success? Speak to us, answer us, thou: Surely the light of thy brow Gave us, giveth us, light, Dark be the season or bright, Strong to support or suppress. Thou, with eyes to the east, Beautiful, vigilant eyes; Father, Comforter, Chief, Joy be it with us or grief, Season of funeral or feast, Careful of thine, of thy least, Careful who lives and who dies. Soul and Spirit of all, Keeping the watch of the world, All through the night-watches, there Gazing through turbulent air Standest; how shall we fall? What should afflict or appal, Though the streamers of storm be unfurled? All the noise of the night, All the thunder of things, All the terrors be hurled Of the blind brute-force of the world, All the weight of the fight, All men's violent might, All the confluence of Kings; Rouse all earth against us, Hurl all heaven against thee? Though it be thus, though it were, Speak to us, if thou be there, Save, tho' indeed it be thus Then that the dolorous Stream sweeps off to the sea. Lift up heads that are hidden, Strengthen hearts that are faint; Lighten on eyes that are blind To the poor of thy kind, Courage their lives over-ridden, Smitten how sorely and chidden Sharply with reins of restraint. Peace, it may be he will say, Somewhat, if yet ye will hear Some great word of a chief, Ask not of joy, neither grief, Ask nothing more of the day, Not whether night be away, Not whether comfort be near. Seek not after a token; Ask not what of the night, Nor what the end of it brings: Seek after none of these things. What though nothing were spoken, Nothing, though all we were broken, Shewn as seen of the light? What if the morning awake Never of us to be seen? Yet, if we die, if we live, That which we have will we give, That which is with us we take, Borne in our hands for her sake Who shall be and is and hath been. She though we die we shall find Surely, though far she be fled, Nay, if we find not at last, We, though we die and go past, Yet shall we leave her behind, Leave to the sons of our kind Men that come after us dead. These shall say of us then; ‘Freedom they had not as we, Yet were none of them slaves; Free they lie in their graves, Our fathers, the ancient of men, Souls that awake not again Free, as we living were free.’ Then, if remembrance remain, Shall we not seeing have said Out of the place where we lie Hearing, rejoice and reply; Men of a world without stain Sons of men that in vain Lie not for love of you dead. 1867. A CAROL FOR CHARITY Winter, friend of health and wealth, Hailed of goodly girls and boys, Slays the poor by strength and health, Makes their lives his lifeless toys. One boy goes galloping over the moorland, Wild with delight of the sunshine and speed, Blithe as a bird on his bleak bright foreland, Glad as the wind or his own glad steed. One, with darkness and toil fast bound, Bound in misery and iron fast, Drags his nakedness underground, Sees the mine as the world at last. Winter, lord of laughing Yule, Winter, weeping on his dead, Bids us ease his iron rule, Bids us bring his poor men bread. A SONG FOR MARGARET MIDHURST God send the sea sorrow And all men that sail thorough. God give the wild sea woe, And all ships that therein go. My love went out with dawn's light; He went down ere it was night. God give no live man good That sails over the sea's flood. God give all live men teen That sail over the waves green. God send for my love's sake All their lovers' hearts break. Many sails went over sea; One took my heart from me. All they, saving one, Came in landward under the sun. Many sails stood in from sea; One twinned my heart and me. Waves white and waves black, One sail they sent not back. Many maidens laughed that tide; I fell down and sore sighed. Many mouths I saw kiss; No man kissed there mine, I wis. Many gat there brooch and glove; I gat but loss of love. I rose and sighed sore; I set my face from the shore. On my fingers fair gold rings, In my heart bitter things. In mine hair combs of pride, I stood up and sore sighed. I looked out over sea; Never a man's eye looked to me. I cried out over the tide; Never a man's mouth on me cried. I came there a goodly thing; I was full wan ere evening. I came there fresh and red; I came thence like one dead. I came there glad and lief; I came thence with heart's grief. God give all men grief, I say, That sail over the seas grey. I laid my head to the sea-stone; I made my bed there alone. I made my bed into the sand, Betwixen sea and green land. Betwixen land and green sea Sorrows and sorrows fell on me. In yellow sea-sand washen well, Weary watches on me fell. There all a night I lay: I would I had died ere day. There in the young light I looked over the waves white. There all a day I stood Looking over the sea's flood. I saw waves black and green, But no man's sail between. I saw waves blue and white, But no sails under the light. There was no wind passed me by, But I was like to die. I sought long and I sought sore, And aye my tears fell more. I found sorrow and much pain, But not my lover again. God gave me a green bed, And no pillow to my head. God gave me brief life's breath, And a good sleep after death. SAIREY GAMP'S ROUNDEL A baby's thumb, the little duck's, Is fitter food than crust or crumb, In baby's mouth when baby sucks A baby's thumb. It gives delight to all and some Who wish the child the best of lucks That ever to a child may come. Its mien is pleasanter than Puck's, Its air triumphant, placid, dumb, Benignant, bland, when baby sucks A baby's thumb. SONG INTENDED FOR CHASTELARD Though ye be never so fair a May As Queen Marie that is so sweet, I am so bounden in love's way I may not go upon my feet. Though ye be never so true a thing As Saint Marie that is so clean, Yet I am so taken in your loving I wis ye be the better queen. Though I be never so good in face As Absalom that was callèd fair, Give me so much of your least grace As I may kiss your neck and hair. Though I be never so wise a king As Solomon that woned out south, Do so much for me, good sweeting, As I may kiss upon your mouth. TO JAMES McNEILL WHISTLER Fly away, butterfly, back to Japan, Tempt not a pinch at the hand of a man, And strive not to sting ere you die away. So pert and so painted, so proud and so pretty, To brush the bright down from your wings were a pity— Fly away, butterfly, fly away! 1888. THE CENTENARY OF SHELLEY Now a hundred years agone among us came Down from some diviner sphere of purer flame, Clothed in flesh to suffer, maimed of wings to soar, One whom hate once hailed as now love hails by name, Chosen of love as chosen of hatred. Now no more Ear of man may hear or heart of man deplore Aught of dissonance or doubt that mars the strain Raised at last of love where love sat mute of yore. Fame is less than love, and loss is more than gain, When the sweetest souls and strongest, fallen in fight, Slain and stricken as it seemed in base men's sight, Rise and lighten on the graves of foeman slain, Clothed about with love of all men as with light, Suns that set not, stars that know not day from night. 1892. RECOLLECTIONS TO WILLIAM BELL SCOTT Years have sped from us under the sun Through blossom and snow-tides twenty-one, Since first your hand as a friend's was mine, In a season whose days are yet honey and wine To the pale close lips of Remembrance, shed By the cupbearer Love for desire of the dead: And the weeds I send you may half seem flowers In eyes that were lit by the light of its hours. For the life (if at all there be life) in them grew From the sun then risen on a young day's dew, When ever in August holiday times I rode or swam through a rapture of rhymes, Over heather and crag, and by scaur and by stream, Clothed with delight by the might of a dream, With the sweet sharp wind blown hard through my hair, On eyes enkindled and head made bare, Reining my rhymes into royal order Through honied leagues of the northland border; Or loosened a song to seal for me A kiss on the clamorous mouth of the sea. So swarmed and sprang, as a covey they start, The song-birds hatched of a hot glad heart, With notes too shrill and a windy joy Fluttering and firing the brain of a boy, With far keen echoes of painless pain Beating their wings on his heart and his brain, Till a life's whole reach, were it brief, were it long, Seemed but a field to be sown with song. The snow-time is melted, the flower-time is fled, That were one to me then for the joys they shed. Joys in garland and sorrows in sheaf, Rose-red pleasure and gold-eared grief, Reared of the rays of a mid-noon sky, I have gathered and housed them, worn and put by These wild-weed waifs with a wan green bloom Found in the grass of that old year's tomb, Touched by the gleam of it, soiled with its dust, I well could leave in the green grave's trust, Lightly could leave in the light wind's care Were all thoughts dead of the dead life there. But if some note of its old glad sound In your ear should ring as a dream's rebound, As a song, that sleep in his ear keeps yet, Tho' the senses and soul rewaking forget. To move so fitly the sprays I send Could come as at hail of the hand of a friend. LANDOR AT FLORENCE The stateliest singing mouth that speaks our tongue, The lordliest, and the brow of loftiest leaf Worn after the great fashion close and brief, Sounds and shines yet; to whom all braids belong Of plaited laurel that no weathers wrong, All increase of the spring and of the sheaf, All high delight and godliness of grief, All bloom and fume of summer and of song. The years are of his household; Fate and Fame Observe him; and the things of pestilence Die out of fear, that could not die of shame, Before his heel he set on their offence: Time's hand shall hoard the gold of such a name When death has blown the dust of base men thence. 1864. MEMORIAL ODE ON THE DEATH OF LECONTE DE LISLE On the first of June 1885, the greatest poet of the nineteenth century was borne to his rest amid the lamentations and the applause of his countrymen, and of all to whom either the example of a noble life or the triumph of a genius inaccessible and unapproachable seemed worthy of honour and regard. Many earnest and cordial and admirable words of tribute and thanksgiving and farewell were uttered over the hearse of Victor Hugo; none more memorable than those in which a great poet became the spokesman of all his kind in honour of the greatest of them all. Short and simple as was the speech of M. Leconte de Lisle, none of the longer and more elaborate orations was more genuinely eloquent, more seriously valuable, than the admirably terse and apt expression of gratitude and reverence with which he bade ‘farewell and hail’ in the name of all surviving poets to their beloved and beneficent master. Nor could a fitter and a worthier spokesman have been imagined or desired by the most exacting or the most ambitious devotions or design. —A. C. S. I Beside the lordliest grave in all the world, A singer crowned with golden years and fame Spake words more sweet than wreaths of incense curled, That bade an elder yet and mightier name Hail, for whose love the wings of time were furled, And death that heard it died of deadlier shame. Our father and lord of all the sons of song, Hugo, supreme on earth, had risen above Earth, as the sun soars noonward: grief and wrong Had yielded up their part in him to love; And one man's word came forth upon the throng Brief as the brooding music of the dove. And he now too, the praiser as the praised, Being silent, speaks for ever. He, whose word Reverberate made the gloom whereon he gazed Radiant with sound whose song in his we heard, Stands far from us as they whose souls he raised Again, and darkness carolled like a bird. II Golden eastern waters rocked the cradle where he slept Songless, crowned with bays to be of sovereign song, Breathed upon with balm and calm of bounteous seas that kept Secret all the blessing of his birthright, strong, Soft, severe, and sweet as dawn when first it laughed and leapt Forth of heaven, and clove the clouds that wrought it wrong. Calm and proud and patient even as light that bides its hour All night long till night wax weary, shone the soul Crowned and girt with light, sublime in peace and sure in power, Sunlike, over tidal years and changes; whole, Full, serene, superb as time that kindles fruit from flower, Lord alike of waves that rest and waves that roll. Sunlight round the soft Virgilian meads where sunbeams sleep Lulled not overlong a spirit of strength to strive Right against the winds that stormier times heard strain and sweep Round the rocks whereon man crucified alive Man, and bade the soul of manhood cower and chant and weep, Strong in vain to soar and seek, to delve and dive. III Time and change and death made music as of life and strife and doom When his lyric spell bade ope the graves of ages dead as dust. Cain, a shadow like a sunrise clad in fire whose light was gloom, Towered above the deepening deluge, crying on justice held unjust, Whence his giant sons should find the world their throne become their tomb, And a wider world of waters hide the strongholds of their trust. Soiled with desert sand and lit with fire of wrath from heaven, the seer Spake for Naboth slain the sentence of the judgment of the Lord: Age on ruining age and year as rolling thunder crashed on year Down the measures of the mighty song that glittered like a sword: Truth and legend strange and fierce as truth or dreams of faith and fear Made their lightnings one to crown it, flashed from stormy chord to chord. Now the lyre whose lord's wise mastery gave its notes reverberate skill Whence to give again the grace of golden gifts or hands long dead, Now the deep clear soul that all the lore of time could scarce fulfil, Now the sovereign voice that spake it, now the radiant eye that read, Seem to sleep as sleeps the indomitable imperishable will Here, that haply lives and sleeps not, though its word on earth be said. 1894. MEMORIAL VERSES ON THE DEATH OF KARL BLIND Across the wide-wing'd years Whose sound no hearkener hears Passing in thunder of reverberate flight, Nor any seer may see What fruit of them shall be, Shines from the death-struck past a living light, And music breathed of memory's breath Attunes the darkling silence born of earthly death. Through all the thunderous time, Now silent and sublime, When Right in hopeless hope waged war on Wrong, His head shone high, his hand Grasped as a burning brand The sword of faith which weakness makes more strong, And they for whom it shines hold fast The trust that Time bequeaths for truth to assure at last. Not prison, not the breath Of doom denouncing death, Could make the manhood in him burn less high For one breath's space than when It shone for following men, A sign to show how man might live or die With freedom in triumphant sight, And hope elate above all fluctuant chance of fight. The German fame of old, By Roman hands inscrolled As bright beyond all nations else borne down, Shone round his banished head, As round the deathless dead With light bequeathed of one coequal crown: And now that his and theirs are one No time shall see the setting of that sovereign sun. All this must all time know While memories ebb and flow Till out of blind forgetfulness is born Fame deathless as the day, When none may think to say Her light is less than noon and even and morn: When glories forged in hell-fire fade, And warrior empires wither in the waste they made. When all a forger's fame Is shrivelled up in shame; When all imperial notes of praise and prayer And hoarse thanksgiving raised To the abject God they praised For murderous mercies are but poisonous air; When Bismarck and his William lie Low even as he they warred on—damned too deep to die. For how should history bid Their names go free, lie hid, Stand scathless of her Tacitean brand? From them forgetfulness, Too bright a boon to bless Crime deep as hell, withholds her healing hand; But while their fame was fresh and rank The old light of German glory here nor sank nor shrank. Here, where all wrongs find aid, Where all foul strengths are stayed, Where empire means not evil, here was one Whose glance, whose smile, whose voice Bade all their souls rejoice Who hailed in sight of English sea and sun A head sublime as theirs who died For England ere her praise was Freedom's crowning pride. Not even his head shone higher, Whose only loftiest lyre Were meet to hail faith pure and proud as his: A pride all praise must wrong Less high than soared the song Wherein the light that was and was not is: The lyric light whence Milton lit The darkness of the darkling days that knew not it. Less high my praise may soar: But when it lives no more Silent and fervent in the secret heart That holds for all time fast The sense of time long past, No sense of life will then therein have part. No thought may speak, no words enshrine, My thanks to him who gave Mazzini's hand to mine. Our glorious century gone Beheld no head that shone More clear across the storm, above the foam, More steadfast in the fight Of warring night and light, True to the truth whose star leads heroes home, Than his who, loving all things free, Loved as with English passion of delight our sea. The joy of glorious age To greet the sea's glad rage With answering rapture as of bird or boy, When sundawn thrilled the foam And bade the sea's flock home, Crowned all a foiled heroic life with joy Bright as the light of living flame, That glows, a deathless gloriole, round his deathless name. 1907. SONNET [Ah, face and hands and body beautiful] Ah, face and hands and body beautiful, Fair tender body, for my body's sake Are you made faultless without stain or break. Locks close as weed in river-water cool, A purer throat and softer than white wool, Eyes where sleep always seems about to wake. No dead man's flesh but feels the strong sweet ache, And that sharp amorous watch the years annul, If his grave's grass have felt you anywhere. Rain and the summer shadow of the rain Are not so gentle to the generous year As your soft rapid kisses are to men, Felt here about my face, yea here and here, Caught on my lips and thrown you back again. BALLAD OF THE FAIR HELMET-MAKER TO THE GIRLS OF JOY FROM VILLON Now think hereof, fair Gloveress, That wast my scholar constantly, And you too, Blanche the Cobbleress, 'Tis time to walk now warily, Take right and left; I pray you, see Ye spare no man in any place; For old girls keep no currency, No more than coin cried down for base. And you, my dainty Flesheress, So light in dance of heel and knee, And Winifred the Weaveress, Despise not low your master free; Ye too must shut up shop, all ye When ye wax old and bleak of face; Of no more use than old priests be, No more than coin cried down for base. Take heed too, Joan the Hatteress, That no friend lime your liberty; No more, fair Kate, the Spurrieress, Bid men go hang or pack to sea; For whoso lacks her beauty, she Gets scorn of them, and no good grace, Foul age takes no man's love for fee, No more than coin cried down for base. Girls, hearken and give heed to me, Why thus I wail and weep my case 'Tis that I find no remedy, No more than coin cried down for base. 1872. CONSTANCE AND FREDERICK Fred. Why should it hurt you that he goes to Rome? Now I am glad; I can sit close to you, Feel my hand put away and lost in yours, And the sweet smell of your long knotted hair Laid on my face and mouth; can kiss you too And not be smitten; that is good for me. Con. Poor child, I love you; yea, keep close by me, So am I safe. Ah! yet no woman here Would pity; keep you closer to me, boy! Fred. Is not this well? now I can touch your sleeve, Count over the thick rings and fair round stones About your neck and forehead, and on mine Lay down the soft palm of your smooth long hand; If I were as my father I would reach Both hands up—so—to bow your head quite down, Pulled by the hair each side, till I could touch The rows of gracious pearl that part your hair. Then I would kiss you, your lips would move to cry And I would make them quiet; ah! but now I cannot reach your lips—not so! alas, And then they shiver and curl sideways, see, And your eyes cry too. Con. There—sit gravelier now! Nay, child, you twist my finger in the ring. Fred. I wonder if God means to leave us so? If he forget us, and my father die, How well that were for you! dear mother, think How we would praise him! Con. Child, no words of it, Let us forget him. Come, I'll spoil a tale, With idle remembrance. There was a king once Lived where the trees are great and green, with leaves The white midwinter keeps alive; there grew All red fruit and all flowers full of gold In the broad low grasses: from the poppy-root Came lilies, and from lily-stems there clomb Tall roses, with close petals, and the stalk Was heavy gold, solid and smooth, the wind Was full of soft rain gathered in the dusk That fell with no clouds near; so this king Grew past a child. Fred. Taller than I? so tall? Con. Ay, where the sun divides the olive-shade; And on his head—Rise, here are men, I think. Enter Massimo and Lucrezia. Mas. What do these here? Hush! now, Madam, I pray you, Though we put on some outer show of man, Think us no more than beast: What certainty is there Or in our faces, in our brows' mould, or In the clear shape and colour of our speech, Sets this word man upon us? We, as you, Are the king's ware, his good necessities; (I'll teach you shortly what this babble means, Fear we not there) good chattels of his use For one to handle; I beseech you, let not The outside of our speech condemn us; else Had we kept mouth shut ever. Con. My fair lord, I know not what ungracious day of mine Hath given you tongue against me. Fred. What says he, mother? May I not kill him? tho' he speaks so high, This is no father: I may kill him then? Con. Hush, boy! this insolence has changed you. Sir, I pray you let me understand; you said (I think) and there was a secret in your speech I must unriddle. Lady Lucrezia, What madness hurts our friend? he speaks awry With a most broken action. Fred. Speak, sir: I Stand for my mother. Mas. So you have set him words To work out, to spell over, each as loud As any threat the mouth makes like a blow? Ay, must his father praise him too? Luc. My lord, It seems that change can make the face of hope Grey as his own thin hair; I loved you well, Put honour on you, which you seemed to wear With natural apprehension and keen grace Past blame of any, over praise of me: Now either my hurt sense is sick to death, Or I conceive such meaning in your talk As makes me faint with shame; I would fain be angry; But shame has left me bare of even will To seem so angry, and to say this out With your set eyes so fast upon my face Grows like shame to me. Mas. Nathless I believe Since you shook hands with shame's last messenger And felt her hand's mark hot along your cheek, Some years have made it whiter. Luc. Pardon me! I know not, Madam, what he speaks. Mas. Nor you? I spoke to Tancred's kinswoman, the queen Who wears the blood of holy centuries In her fair palms and forehead; their blue curves Royally written; nay, this boy's soft lip So red and fair by that imperial sign, By your most gracious warrant; else I'll say The name you had was bastarded, and you Some wicked season's error. Luc. Are you mad? See, her mouth trembles, tears drop over it, Her brows move: now, be silent! Mas. Then I'll end! I held this lady so past service, yea Past man's approval or the keenest feet Of his obedience: You're my kinswoman, And the dear honour that I have of you Hath borne some witness; now for her, I'll say I would forget you, and unclothe my soul Of its strong reverence and opinion That makes you to me as the music is To the dead cithern there, as the live smell To some quick flower midways the lily-row. So I hold you—well, I'd forget all this To serve her; that was Lady Constance here, When she was no mere German ornament Scrawled broad with some gold flourishes at top Above some Austrian document to prove Our lord a liar, some stale letter, say, To be just fingered by Pope Celestin Before he tears it, tears her name and all. No witness of that devil's assurance made Between our masters, that strong bond that holds Treason each side—no empress of this mould, But just the lady we had just to serve, Live by or die for—oh, not when she bade But when God thought she might have need of him, Tancred's own blood, the king's own very flesh, Made for our sakes so beautiful and weak That we might even help God by serving her— The maiden face more gracious than was need To keep it perfect—yea, more love in the lip Than what sufficed us to accredit her As only Constance, more repose i' the eyes Than had alone constrained her worship out— For certes no man ever wondered much Why she wants worship! (to complete her, say) And what were love's work? yea, thus verily God wrought her with good cunning; and our part Was to be patient—some day this might end, She might pray God to find us room, suppose— So many as we were, and such poor blood As this might wash her floorèd palace clean— I talk that old way! See how pale she is, Her eyes more narrow, and with shallow lights Filling them, broken hints of purposes, How pain has worn the golden secret out Some strange grand language wrote upon her face. All this more wasted than a flame that fails On sick lamp lit at daybreak—more rebuked, Chastened and beaten by the imperious time, Than my words last year spoken! Con. Oh, not so: Not the soul—let the body wear so thin Each feature shows of it by this— Mas. I said No man's change that we are ruled by does much harm, God overlines it, shall not the queen live? But this so new and bitter thing to taste That poisons me—this curse that changes her I saw not ever. Con. This— Mas. That you should turn A woman none of those men pay to find The costliness of such a golden sin As loves by hire and loves not—no such thing Would praise or pity, would despise or hate— A shame familiar on the pander's lip, Smiled out by courtiers from their slippery mouth, Laughed over, chattered over by the page A groom might spit on—handled, breathed upon By the spent breath in his mid office, worn As garb and badge of his necessity On one permitted shoulder, by this king . . . POPE CELESTIN AND GIORDANO Gio. These matters are but shadows of the truth, Mean indications; time will shew, my lord, Our wrong lies deeper. Cel. Proofs—ay, proofs you say— Let me see that, sir: I'll believe your proof: What must I do? what stirs you up to give This dead dissension teeth to bite again? And I am old; my body is no wall For you to shoot behind at emperors: Ay, the keen spirit eats the flesh like fire, It's mere slow poison, this my dignity, Consumes me; ah, you're just a man, my Count, Cannot conceive how God's will overcomes, How the Church bears one's very soul to hold And stoops the shoulders; then, we're set to pray Save you your souls, gather you fruit of prayer, Not whet you fresh blades when blood mars the old: Ah, what must we do? Gio. But, your Holiness Imagines not we seek your wrong in this: Our words are meant to save God's Church and you From this man's red and insolent hands, put forth To pluck you out of kingdom, set you up But as a dead thing, as a monument That boys may spit at. Sir, if you speak of peace, Best cover up the face of you and weep Till he be here: it may be he will say ‘Throw me that hoar scalp to the dogs,’ or else ‘Nay, find him some low cell not overboard And slip the chain's knot close enough to press The lean old wrist and elbow’: this may be. Cel. This! Oh, God help me, but how cold it gets! Why—but I think, by Venus, it's no spring But winter comes to pinch us by the chin. —Are not we vicar of the Son of God? Are not we lord of you and him? Ha, see How the flames twinkle when my hand goes up! The fingers are but lank as sprays of wood In the late snow-time, eh, or blades embrowned On some lean field this bitter March—see, Count, This grey hair comes on all! ay, well I know The blessèd tonsure came on it before— Ay, thin scalp, said you! yea, but, sir, no Count Keeps always dark hair, not so thick as yours, God help it! Gio. I beseech your Holiness Even by the sweet blood of your Lord the Christ, Believe me this is perilous to say: You talk of things that either you must kill Or they will smite you on the sacred face, Discredit you, despoil the chosen gold On the dear bosom of this mother Church, Uncover— Cel. Ah, sir, tell me not of these! An old man—ere the blessèd knife had shorn One black top curl, I might have answered you; I was too young—eh, well, suppose men talk, What matter? there's a lie in each man's mouth. Yea ‘dixi’ said God's blessed Psalmist once, ‘Dixi,’ that's where the choir breaks out full breath, Makes half the sweet smoke ripple graciously, Praising God's mother in delicious wise. Ah, sir, be very tender of such words; The trampled flesh is like a hurt snake's head, Most quick to peer up sharply—ah, sir, then It stings the blood thro', verily! Gio. My lord— Cel. Ay, then begins to stir and strike and more God keep us—worries as with angry teeth, This sensual serpent of the evil flesh, With its bruised head alive and such keen eyes, And such a large mouth with lean lips astir, Ah, sir, be very tender of the flesh! Gold said you, gold? there was hair once she had Most like a Byzant painter makes For some saint's face—alas, the hair she had Which now red worms have eaten to the roots! Ah, flesh is weaker than a rich man's breath, An old man's hand with fingers shut like these— The mouth she had which years ago black earth Filled to the lips that used to kiss me once, Which Mary pardon! so shall I too die And have my body eaten of cold worms As Herod—so Christ pardon me the sin! Gold said you, on her bosom? ah, she wore An armlet of thin gold, and on her neck There was a plait she had of threaded yellow silk— And all this has been done with many years, And will not come again. I grow so old, So old and sick, alas the evil flesh! Gio. I told your Holiness of Henry's aim, His aim assured and evident, to seize The Church lands and the Church's wealth, if you Confirm not, sir, his tyrannous dignity By the mere seal of strong permission: think I do beseech you by Queen Mary's might, What shame, what utter peril there should be If this thing fall! That henceforth one may say Trust in the Church and trust, and find no place Where truth makes head against the violent world— If you do this: yea, men will violate Things hidden with securest insolence; So that between the slayer's bearded mouth And the chaste lip of reverence there will be Even such communion as the traitor's kiss, A present lie for ever. Cel. Ay, woe's me, A lie to say—a very bitter lie To take upon the tongue we pray withal. Alas, sir, while God keeps us scant of grace, The body and the body's frail thin sense Is liable to most dangerous attributes, Is vulnerable to any sword of sins, To any craft of Satan's; we should think We are made of most frail body and weak soul Mere tools for diabolic usages, For ministration of man's enemy Whom God confound! nathless it hath been kept. I say, sir, there be men have seldom sinned Since the pure vow made clean their fleshly lips: To God ascribe the praise, my son, not me; Yea, be it written for me in God's book What have I done—whereof I take but blame Seeing there is no profit in me, none, Nor in my service: verily, I think The keeper of God's house is more than I, Who have but served him these hoar eighty years With barren service. Gio. (Ay, past help of mine!) I pray you then, my lord, that of your grace I may speak with the Cardinal Orsino As in your name; he loves me well, there's none Of more swift judgment and deliberate act, Nor who serves justice better. Cel. Yea, my lord, You shall have letters to the Cardinal; A good man, who hath slain the flesh of sin— A good man, certainly no son of Christ Hath done more service, is more ripe for grace. He hath looked seldom on the evil thing To hunger for it in the bond of lust, Or violence of the keen iniquitous will: I'll send him letters—yea, a man of grace, A pillar fairly carven of wrought stone All builded without hammer, clean and fair To do God honour, and accredit us The builder of him: for his judgment, sir, That shall you test, but all grow old in time. Ay, soon or late God fashions us anew By some good pattern; so shall all get made Fit to be welded stone by shapen stone Into the marvellous Jerusalem wall That shall be builded. A good man, I said, But somewhat older than he was, meseems, That shall you notice; let him not suspect That I misdoubt him, sir; he hath been wise, Fulfilled of grace and wisdom: but our time Is as a day—as half a day with God: Yea, as a watch that passeth in the night And is not honoured. Come, sir, you shall go: I pray God prosper you, and overcome The evil of your body, by his grace. Also the Cardinal, that he may speak Things worthy, which shall worthily be heard, For without wisdom are we as the grass Which the sun withers: yea, our sojourn here Is as a watch that passeth in the night. KING BAN A FRAGMENT These three held flight upon the leaning lands At undern, past the skirt of misty camps Sewn thick from Benwick to the outer march— King Ban, and, riding wrist by wrist, Ellayne, And caught up with his coloured swathing-bands Across her arm, a hindrance in the reins, A bauble slipt between the bridle-ties, The three months' trouble that was Launcelot. For Claudas leant upon the land, and smote This way and that way, as a pestilence Moves with vague patience in the unclean heat This way and that way; so the Gaulish war Smote, moving in the marches. Then King Ban Shut in one girdled waist of narrow stones His gold and all his men, and set on them A name, the name of perfect men at need, And over them a seneschal, the man Most inward and entailed upon his soul, That next his will and in his pulses moved As the close blood and purpose of his heart, And laid the place between his hands, and rode North to the wild rims of distempered sea That, crossed to Logres, his face might look red [sic] The face of Arthur, and therein light blood Even to the eyes and to the circled hair For shame of failure in so near a need, Failure in service of so near a man. Because that time King Arthur would not ride, But lay and let his hands weaken to white Among the stray gold of a lady's head. His hands unwedded: neither could bring help To Ban that helped to rend his land for him From the steel wrist of spoilers, but the time A sleep like yellow mould had overgrown, A pleasure sweet and sick as marsh-flowers. Therefore about his marches rode King Ban With eyes that fell between his hands to count The golden inches of the saddle-rim, Strange with rare stones; and in his face there rose A doubt that burnt it with red pain and fear All over it, and plucked upon his heart, The old weak heart that loss had eaten through, Remembering how the seneschal went back At coming out from Claudas in his tent; And how they bound together, chin by chin, Whispered and wagged, and made lean room for words, And a sharp mutter fed the ears of them. And he went in and set no thought thereon To waste; fear had not heart to fear indeed, The king being old, since any fear in such Is as a wound upon the fleshly sense That drains a parcel of his time thereout, Therefore he would not fear that as it fell This thing should fall. For Claudas the keen thief For some thin rounds and wretched stamps of gold Had bought the tower and men and seneschal, Body and breath and blood, yea, soul and shame. They knew not this, at halt upon a hill. Only surmise was dull upon the sense And thin conjecture sickened in the speech; So they fell silent, riding in the hills. There on a little terrace the good king Reined, and looked out. Far back the white lands lay; The wind went in them like a broken man, Lamely; the mist had set a bitter lip To the rimmed river, and the moon burnt blank. But outward from the castle of King Ban There blew a sound of trouble, and there clomb A fire that thrust an arm across the air, Shook a rent skirt of dragging flame, and blanched The grey flats to such cruel white as shone Iron against the shadow of the sky Blurred out with its blind stars; for as the sea Gathers to lengthen a bleached edge of foam Whole weights of windy water, and the green Brine flares and hisses as the heap makes up, Till the gaunt wave writhes, trying to breathe, Then turns, and all the whited rims of steel Lean over, and the hollowed round roars in And smites the pebble forward in the mud, And grinds the shingle in cool whirls of white, Clashed through and crossed with blank assault of foam, Filled with hard thunder and drenched dregs of sand— So leant and leapt the many-mouthèd fire, So curled upon the walls, dipt, crawled, smote, clung, Caught like a beast that catches on the flesh, Waxed hoar with sick default, shivered across, Choked out, a snake unfed. Thereat King Ban Trembled for pain in all his blood, and death Under the heart caught him and made his breath Wince, as a worm does, wounded in the head; And fear began upon his flesh, and shook The chaste and inly sufferance of it Almost to ruin; a small fire and keen Eating in muscle and nerve and hinge of joint Perilous way; so bitter was the blow Made on his sense by treason and sharp loss. Then he fell weeping tears, with blood in them, Like that red sweat that stained Gethsemane With witness, when the deadly kiss had put Shame on the mouth of Judas; and he cried, Crying on God, and made out words and said: Fair lord, sweet lord, most pleasant to all men, To me so pleasant in clean days of mine That now are rained upon with heavy rain, Soiled with grey grime and with the dusty years, Because in all those tourneys and hot things I had to do with, in all riding times And noise of work, and on smooth holidays Sitting to see the smiting of hard spears, And spur-smiting of steeds and wrath of men, And gracious measure of the rounded game, I held you in true honour and kept white The hands of my allegiance as a maid's, Being whole of faith and perfect in the will. Therefore I pray you, O God marvellous, See me how I am stricken among men, And how the lip I fed with plenteousness And cooled with wine of liberal courtesy Turns a snake's life to poison me and clings— DISGUST A DRAMATIC MONOLOGUE A woman and her husband, having been converted from free thought to Calvinism, and being utterly miserable in consequence, resolve to end themselves by poison. The man dies, but the woman is rescued by application of the stomach-pump. —[A. C. S.] I Pills? talk to me of your pills? Well, that, I must say, is cool. Can't bring my old man round? he was always a stubborn old fool. If I hadn't taken precautions—a warning to all that wive— He might not have been dead, and I might not have been alive. II You would like to know, if I please, how it was that our troubles began? You see, we were brought up Agnostics, I and my poor old man. And we got some idea of selection and evolution, you know— Professor Huxley's doing—where does he expect to go! III Well, then came trouble on trouble on trouble—I may say, a peck— And his cousin was wanted one day on the charge of forging a cheque— And his puppy died of the mange—my parrot choked on its perch. This was the consequence, was it, of not going weekly to church? IV So we felt that the best if not only thing that remained to be done On an earth everlastingly moving about a perpetual sun, Where worms breed worms to be eaten of worms that have eaten their betters— And reviewers are barely civil—and people get spiteful letters— And a famous man is forgot ere the minute hand can tick nine— Was to send in our P.P.C., and purchase a packet of strychnine. V Nay—but first we thought it was rational—only fair— To give both parties a hearing—and went to the meeting-house there, At the curve of the street that runs from the Stag to the old Blue Lion. ‘Little Zion’ they call it—a deal more ‘little’ than ‘Zion.’ VI And the preacher preached from the text, ‘Come out of her.’ Hadn't we come? And we thought of the shepherd in Pickwick—and fancied a flavour of rum Balmily borne on the wind of his words—and my man said, ‘Well, Let's get out of this, my dear—for his text has a brimstone smell.’ VII So we went, O God, out of chapel—and gazed, ah God, at the sea. And I said nothing to him. And he said nothing to me. VIII And there, you see, was an end of it all. It was obvious, in fact, That, whether or not you believe in the doctrine taught in a tract, Life was not in the least worth living. Because, don't you see? Nothing that can't be, can, and what must be, must. Q.E.D. And the infinitesimal sources of Infinite Unideality Curve in to the central abyss of a sort of a queer Personality Whose refraction is felt in the nebulæ strewn in the pathway of Mars Like the parings of nails Æonian—clippings and snippings of stars— Shavings of suns that revolve and evolve and involve and at times Give a sweet astronomical twang to remarkably hobbling rhymes. IX And the sea curved in with a moan—and we thought how once—before We fell out with those atheist lecturers—once, ah, once and no more, We read together, while midnight blazed like the Yankee flag, A reverend gentleman's work—the Conversion of Colonel Quagg. And out of its pages we gathered this lesson of doctrine pure— Zephaniah Stockdolloger's gospel—a word that deserves to endure Infinite millions on millions of infinite Æons to come— ‘Vocation,’ says he, ‘is vocation, and duty duty. Some.’ X And duty, said I, distinctly points out—and vocation, said he, Demands as distinctly—that I should kill you, and that you should kill me. The reason is obvious—we cannot exist without creeds—who can? So we went to the chemist's—a highly respectable church-going man— And bought two packets of poison. You wouldn't have done so?—Wait. It's evident, Providence is not with you, ma'am, the same thing as Fate. Unconscious cerebration educes God from a fog, But spell God backwards, what then? Give it up? the answer is, dog. (I don't exactly see how this last verse is to scan, But that's a consideration I leave to the secular man.) XI I meant of course to go with him—as far as I pleased—but first To see how my old man liked it—I thought perhaps he might burst. I didn't wish it—but still it's a blessed release for a wife— And he saw that I thought so—and grinned in derision—and threatened my life If I made wry faces—and so I took just a sip—and he— Well—you know how it ended—he didn't get over me. XII Terrible, isn't it? Still, on reflection, it might have been worse. He might have been the unhappy survivor, and followed my hearse. ‘Never do it again?’ Why, certainly not. You don't Suppose I should think of it, surely? But anyhow—there—I won't.</field>
