      <field name="fulltext">A new Drol. Let that Majestick Pen that writes, Of brave K?Arthur and his Knights, And of their Noble feats and fights Be silent. And now let each one listen well, While I the Famous battel tel, In Woodstreet-Counter that befel, In high Lent. In which great Scuffle only twan, Without much hurt, or being slain, Immortal Honor did obtain, by Merit. One was a Captain in degree, A strong and lufty man was he, T'ther a Trades-man bold and free, Of Spirit. And though he was no man of force, He had a stomack like a Horse, And in his Rage had no Remose, Or pitty. Full nimbly could he cuff and clout, And was accounted without doubt, One of the prettiest Sparks about, The City. And at his Weapon any way, He could perform a single Fray, Even from the Long Pike, to the TAY- LOR'S Bodkin. He reckt not for his flesh a jot, He far'd not Englishman nor Scot, For Man or Monster, car'd he not A Dodkin. For fighting was his Recreation, And like a man in Desperation, For Law, Edict, or Proclamation, He car'd not. And in his anger (cause being given) To lift his hand 'gainst good Sir Steven, Or any Justice under Heaven, He fear'd not. He durst his Enemy withstand, Or at Tergoos or Calis Sand, And bravely there with Sword in hand Would greet him. And Noble Ellis was his name, VVho amongst his foes to purchase fame, Nor car'd though the Devil came To meet him. And this brave Gold-smith was the man, VVho first this worthy brawl began, Which after ended in a Can Of mild Beer. But had you seen him when you fought, How eagerly for blood he sought, There's no man but would have him thought a wilde Bear. Imagine now yon see a score Of Mad-cap Gentlemen or more, Boyes that did use to Royst and Rore, and swagger. Among the which were three or foure, That Rul'd themselves by Wisdoms Lore, Whose very Gransires scarcely wore. a Dagger. A Priest and a Lawyer, men well read, In wiping Spoons, and chipping bread, And falling too, a short Grace being sed, Fill roundly. Whose hungry Mawes no Sallets need, Good appetites therein to breed, Their Stomacks without Sauce could feed, Profoundly. 'Twas ill that men of sober Diet, Who lov'd to fill their Guts in quiet, VVere plac'd with Ruffins that to Royot Were given. And (O great grief!) even from their Food, (Their Stomacks too, being strong and good) And that sweet place whereon it stood, be driven. But here 'tis sitting I repeat, VVhat Food our dainty Prisoners eat, But if in placing of the Meat, and Dishes. From curious Order I do swerve, 'Tis that themselves did none observe, For which no flesh they did deserve, nor Fishes. But some (perhaps) will say, that Lent Affords them not what here is ment, So much, so good, and that they went Without it. 'Tis like, but if I add a Dish Or twain, or three, of Flesh, or Fish, They either had, or did it wish, Ne're doubt it. Then wipe your Mouthes, while I declare, The goodness of this Lenten fare, Which is in Prison very, Rare, I tell ye. The Supper.Furmity as sweet as any Nut, As good as ever swil'd a Gut, And Butter sweet as ere was put In belly. Eggs by the dozen, new and good, VVhich in white Salt upright stood, And meats which heat and stir the blood. To action. As butter'd Crabs, and Lobsters Red, VVhich send the Married pair to bed, And in loose bloods have often bred, a Faction. Fish buttered to the Platters brim, And Parsnips did in butter swim, Strew'd ore with Pepper neat and trim, Salt Salmon. Smelts cride, come eat me, do not stay, Fresh Cod, and Maids full nearly lay, And next to these a lusty Ba? con Gammon. Stuck thick with Cloves upon the back, VVell stuft with Sage, and for the Smack, Daintily strew'd with Pepper black, Saus?d Gurnet. Picktel, Sturgeon, Tench, and Trout, Meat far too good for such a Rout, To tumble, toss, and throw about, and spurn it. The next a Neats-tongue neatly dryde, Mustard and Suger by his side, Rochets butter'd, Flounders fryde, Hot Custard. Eeles boyl'd and broyled; and next they bring Herring that is the Fishes King, And then a Courtly Poll of Ling, and Mustard. But stay, I had almost forgot, The flesh that still stands piping hot, Some from the Spit, some from the Pot New taken. A shoulder, and a Leg of Mutton, As good as ever Knife was put on, VVhich never were by a true Glutton, Forsaken. A Loyn of Veal, that would have dar'd One of the hungriest of the Guard, And they sometimes will feed full hard, Like tall men. And such as love the lusty Chine, But when that I shall sup or dine, God grant they be no Guests of mine, Of all men. Thus the descriptions are compleat, Which I have made of Men and Meat, Mars aid me now, while I repeat The battle. VVhere pots and stools were us'd as Gins, To break each others Heads and Shins, Where blows did make bones in their skins To rattle. VVhere men to madness never ceast; Till each (furious as a beast) Had spoild the fashion of a Feast, Full dainty. VVhereon had they not been accurst, They might have fed, till bellies burst, But Ellis shew'd himself the worst, Of twenty. For he began this monstrous brall, VVhich afterward incens'd them all, To throw the meat about the Hall, That Even. And now give ear unto the Jar, That fell between these men of VVar,, VVherein so many a harmless Scar Was given The board thus furnisht, each man sate, Some fell to feeding, some to prate, 'Mong whom a jarring Question strait Was risen. For they grew hotly in dispute, VVhat Calling was of most Repute, 'Twas well their VVits were so accute In prison. But after a deliberate pause, The Lawyer spoke, as he had cause, In commendation of the Laws Profession. The Law, quoth he, by a just doom, Doth censure all that to it come, And still defends the innocent from Oppression. It favours Truth; it curbs the hope Of Vice; it gives Allegiance scope; Provides a Gallows and a Rope For Treason. This doth the Law, and this is it Which makes us here in Prison sit, Which grounded is on holy VVrit And Reason, To which all men must subject be, As we by daily proof do see, From highest to lowest degree, The Schollar, Noble, and Rich: It doth subdue The Souldier, and his Swaggering crew, But at that word the Captain grew In Choller. He look't ful grim, and at first word Rapt out an Oath, that shook the board, And struck his fist, that the Sound roar'd Like thunder. It made all skip that stood him near, The frighted Custard quak'd for fear, And those that heard it striken were With Wonder. Nought did he now but frown and puff And having star'd and swore enough, Thus he began in Language rough. Thou cogging, Base foisting Lawyer, that dost set Thy minde on nothing, but to get Thy living by thy damned pet- [illeg.] A Slave that shall for half a Crown, With Buckram-bag, and daggled-Gowne, Wait like my Dog obout the Town, And follow A business of the Devils part, For Fees though not with Law nor Art, But head as empty as thy heart, Is hollow, You stay at home and pocket fees, While we abroad our bloods do leese, And then with such base terms as these, You wrong us: But Lawyer, it is safer far For thee to prattle at a Bar, Than once to shew thy face i'th VVar, Among us. VVhere to defend such thankless Hinds, The Souldier little quiet finds, But is expos'd to stormy winds, and Weather. And oft in blood he wades full deep, Your throats from forraign Swords to keep, And wakes when you securely sleep In feathers. VVhat could your Laws, or Statutes do, Against invasions of the foe, Did not the valient Souldier go To quell 'em! And to prevent your further harms, With Ensign, Fife, and loud Alarms Of Warlike Drum, by force of Arms Repell 'em. Wer't not for us thou Swade, quoth he, Where would'st thou fog to get a Fee? But to defend such things as thee, 'Tis pitty. For such as thou, esteem us least, Who ever have been ready prest, To guard you, and the Cuckowes nest, Your City. That very word made Ellis start And all his blood ran to his heare, He shook, and quak'd in every part With hunger. He lookt as if nought might asswage The heat of his enflamed rage, His very countenance did presage Some danger. A Cuckowes nest, quoth he: and so, He hum'd, and held his head full low, As if distracted thoughts did overpress him. At length, quoth he, my Mother sed, At Bristow she was brought to bed, And there was Ellis born and bred, (God bless him.) Of London City I am free, And there I first my Wife did see, And for that very cause, quoth he, I love it. And he that calls it Cuckowes nest, Except he sayes, he speaks in jest, He is a Villain, and a Beast, He prove it. For though I am a man of Trade, And free of London City made, Yet can I use Gun, Bill, and blade In battle, And Citizens, if need require, Themselves can force the Foe retire, VVhatever this Low-Country Squire do prattle For we have Souldiers of our own, able enough to guard the Town, And Captains of most fair renown, about it. If any Foe should fight amain, and set on us with all his Train, VVee'l make him to Retire again,â Nere doubt it. We have fought well in Dangers past, And will do while our Lives do last, Without the help of any Castâ Commanders That thither come, compel'd by want, With Rusty Swords, and Suits Provant, From Utrich, Numigen, or Gantâ In Flanders. The Captain could no longer hold, But looking fiercely, plainly told The Citizen, he was too bold,â and called him Proud Boy, and for his sawcy Speech, Did shortly vow to whip his Breech: Then Ellis snatcht the pot, with whichâ He mall'd him. He threw the Jugge, and therewith-all (The Scuffle.)He gave the Captain such a mall, As made him thump against the wallâ His Crooper, With that the Captain took a Dish That stood brim ful of butter'd fish, As good as any heart could wishâ To Supper. And as he threw, his foot did slide, Which turn'd his arm and dish aside, And all be-butter-fishisideâ Nic Ballat. and he good man, did none disease, But sitting quiet: and at ease, With buttered Rochets, sought to pleaseâ His Pallat. but when he felt the wrong he had, He Rag'd, and swore, and grew stark mad, Some in the Room been better hadâ without him; For he took hold of any thing, And first he caught the Poll of Ling, Which he couragiously did flingâ aboat him. Out of his Hand it flew a pace, And hit the Lawyer in the face, Who at the Board in highest placeâ was seated. and as the Lawyer thought to rise, The Salt was thrown into his Eyes, Which him of Sight in woful wiseâ defeated. all things nere Hand, Ne Ballat threw: At length his butter'd Rochets flew, And hit by chance, amongst the Crew,â The Parson. The Sauce his Coat did all be-wet, The Priest began to fume and fret, The Seat was butter'd which he set, Hisâon, He knew not what to do or say, It was in vain to preach or pray, Or cry you are all gone astray, Good people. He might as well go strive to teach Divinity beyond his reach, Or when the Bells ring out, go preach I'th Steeple. At this mischance the silly man, Out of the room would fain have ran, and very angerly began To mutter. Ill luck had he, for after that, One threw the Parsneps full of fat, VVhich stuck like Brooches in his Hat with Butter. Out of the place he soon repairs, And ran half headlong down the stairs, and made complaint to Master Ayres With crying. Up ran he to know the matter, and found-how they the things did scatter, Here a Trencher, there a Platter, Were lying. I dare not say he stunck for wo, Not will, unless I did it know, But some there be that dares say so that smelt him. Nor could ye blame him, if he did, For they threw dishes at his head, and did with Eggs and Loaves of bread bepelt him, He thrust himself into the throng, and us'd the vertue of his tongue, But what could one man word among So many? The Candles all were shuffled out, The Victuals flew afresh about; VVas never such a Combat fought by any. Now in the dark was all the coyl, Some were bloody in the broyl, and some lay steept in Sailet-Oyl and Mustard. The fight would make a man a feard: another had a buttered Beard, Anothers face was all besmeard with Custard. Others were dawb'd up to the knee, VVith buttered Fish and Furmitee; and some the men could scarcely seeâ that beat 'em. Under the board ?Eluellen? lay, Being sore frighted with the fray, and as the vveapons flew that way,â be eat 'em. The bread stuck in the vvindows all, Like bullets in a Castle-wall, VVhich furious foes do seek to scaleâ In battle. Shoulders of Mutton, and Loyns of Veal, Appointed for to serve the meal, about their eares full many a pealâ did rattle. The which when Mr. Blany spide, Oh, take away their arms he cryde, Lest some great hurt do them betide,â Prevent it. And then the knave away did steal, Or food that fell, no little deal, and in his house at many a mealâ He spent it. The Captain ran the rest among, as eager to revenge the wrong Done by the Plot which Ellis flungâ So stoutly. And angry Ellis sought about, To finde the furious Captain out, at length they met, and then they foughtâ devoutly. Now being met, they never lin, Till with their loud robustuous din, The room and all that was thereinâ did rumble. Instead of VVeapons made of Steel, The Captain took a salted Eele, and at each blow made Ellis reel,â and tumble. Ellis a pippin-pye had got, A sorer vveapon than the Pot: For lo, the apples being hot,â did scald him. The Captain laid about him still, As if he would poor Ellls kill, and with his Eele with a good willâ He mall'd him At length quoth he, Ellis thou art a fellow of couragious heart, Yield now, and I will take thy partâ hereafter. Quoth Ellis, much I scorn to hear, Thy words of threats, being free from fear, VVith which he hardly could forbearâ from laughture. Together then afresh they flie, The Eele against the Pippin pye. But Blany stood there purposelyâ To watch them. The vveapons wherewithall they fought, VVere those for which he chiefly sought, and with an eager stomack thoughtâ To catch 'em. But scap't not now so well away, as that the Veal and Mutton-fray: He thought to have with such a preyâ His jawes fed. But all his hope did turn aside, He lookt for that which luck deny'd, For Ellis all be-pippin-pydeâ His Calves head. Wo was the case he now was in, The apples hot, did scald the skin, His Skull, as it had rotten bin,â did coddle. VVith that one fool among the rout, Made out-cry all the house about, That Blany's brains were beaten outâ. his noddle. VVhich Lockwood hearing needs would see, vvhat all-this coyl and stir might bee, and up the stairs his Guts and heâ went wadling. But when he came the Chamber near, Behind the door he stood to hear, but in he durst not come for fearâ of swadling. There stood he in a frightful case, and as by chance he stir'd his face, Full in the mouth a butter'd Playceâ did hit him. Away he sneakt, and with his tongue, He lick'd and swallowed up the wrong, and as he went the room alongâ Beâhim. For help now doth poor Lockwood cry, O! bring a Surgeon, or I die, My Guts out of my Belly fly:â Come quickly. Blany with open mouth likewise, For present help of Surgeon cryes, Pitty a man, quoth he that liesâ So sickly. Philips, the kilful Surgeon then, vvas cal'd, and cal'd, and cal'd agen, If he had skill to cure these men,â To shew it. At length he comes, and first he puts His hands, to feel for Lockwoods Guts vvhich came not forth so sweet as Nuts,â all know it. He cries for water. In the mean One calls up Madge the Kitchin-quean, To take and make the Baby cleanâ and clout 'it. Fast by the Nose she took the Squall, and led him softly through the Hall, Least the perfume through knees should fallâ about it. She turn'd his Hose beneath the knee, Nor could she chuse but laugh to see, That yellow which was wont to beâ a white-breech. She took a Dish-clout off the shelf, and with it wipt the dirty Elf, vvhich had not wit to help it selfâ Poorâbreech, Thus leaving Lockwood all be-raid, Unto the mercy of the Maid vvho well deserved to be paydâ for taking. Such homely pains, Now let us cast, Our thoughts back on the stir that's past, and them whose bones could not in hastâ leave aking. And like the Candles, shall my Pen Shew you these Gallants once agen, vvhich now like Furies, not like menâ appeared. Fresh Lights being brought t'appease the braul, Shew twenty mad men in the Hall, vvith Blood and Sauce their faces allâ besmeared. Their Cloaths rent and sows'd in drink, Oyl, Mustard, Butter, and the stinck, vvhich Lockwood left, would make one thinkâ in sadness. That these so monstrous creatures dwell, Either in Bedlam, or in Hell, Or that no tongue or Pen can tellâ their madness. They were indeed disfigured so, Friend knew not friend, nor foe-man foe, And each man scarce himself did know:â But after. A frantick staring round about, They suddenly did quit their doubt, And loudly all at once brake out in Laughter. The heat of all is now alaid, The Keepers gently do perswade; And (a before) all friends are made full frankly. Ellis, the Captain doth imbrace, The Captain doth return the grace, And so do all the men in the place, as friendly. By Jove I love thee, Ellis cry'd, The Captain soon as much replyed, Thou art, quoth he, a man well try'd, and Vulcan With Mars at ods again shall be, E're any Jars 'twixt thee and me: And there upon I drink to thee a full Can. And then he kneel'd upon the ground, Drink't off (quoth Ellis) for this Round For ever shall beheld Renown: and never. May any quarrel twixt us twain Arise, or this renew again, But may we loving friends remain for ever Amen, cry'd Captain so did all, And so the health went through the Hall, And thus the Noble Counter-brall was ended. But hunger now did vex 'em more, Then all their anger did before: They searcht i'th Room how far their Store extended, They want the Meat which Blany stole, One finds a HERRING in a hole. With durt and dust, black as a Cole, and trodden All under feet; The next in post Snaps up, and feed on what was lost, And looks not whether it be Rost, or Soddon. A third finds in another place, A piece of LING in durty case, And Mustard in his fellows face; Another Espies, that finds a Loaf of bread: A dish of Butter all bespread. And stuck upon anothers Head I'th Poother. Thus what they found, contented some, At length the Keeper brings a Broom, Meaning therewith to cleanse the Room with Sweeping. But under Table, on the ground, Looking to sweep, by chance he found Luellin, faining to be sound- ly sleeping. He pull'd him out so swift by the heels, As if his Arse had ran on wheeles. And found his pockets stuft with Eeles: His Codpiece Did plenty of provision bring, Somewhat is held of every thing, Smelts, Flounders, Rochets, and of Ling a broad piece. at this discovery, each man Round; Took equal share of what was found, VVhich afterwards they freely drown'd In good Drink; For of good Beer there was good store, Till all was glad to give it or'e, For each man had enough, and more That would drink. And when they thus had drunk and fed, (As if no quarrel had been bred) They all shook hands, and to bed did shuffle. Ellis, the glory of this Town, VVith that brave Captain of Renown, And thus I end this Famous COVN- TER-SCUFFLE. FINIS.</field>
