      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS The DUKE of YORK. To Miss Catherine Yeo. What passion dictates, and what love recites, See my hand tremble while my heart indites; Health to my dearest maid, these strains I send, Health, which my dearest maid, alone can lend; Believe the honest verse, or let my blood Write the sad accents in a purple flood; Believe the falling tear, the rising sigh That heaves my breast, and swells upon my eye: On the fair page see briny drops appear, Anxious to drown the tidings which they bear. Did fate propritious to my vows incline, And kindly fix my golden lot with thine, With how much rapture would the moments roll, Blest with the darling object of my soul; But now accurs'd, by ill-starr'd fate's decree, I fly my country, my content, and thee. Farewell my charmer, oh! these lines review, Then judge what pangs I feel to bid adieu! To Mr. S. Go, virtuous S. and with you ever go, All you can taste of happiness below: By time at length grown wiser, I resign A bliss, for me too perfect and divine; As bounteous clouds, that teem with liquid show'rs, Now here, now there, diffuse their useful stores, So you, from place to place should ever range, Rejoicing every climate with the change; For, wheresoe'er your devious footsteps stray, The spot must glow with intellectual day; Blest with the beams of knowledge which you shed, And rich with treasures of your virtue bred. But must I then, whose soul like lightning flew, To meet the kindred soul it found in you, (Forgive my pride) so soon alas! resign The new-born joy, nor call it longer mine? It must be so, stern fate will have its way; My tyrant stars command, and I obey. [E'er to thy cause or thee my heart inclin'd] E'er to thy cause or thee my heart inclin'd, Or love to B? had attach'd my mind; In female joys I plac'd my sole delight, The morn was pleasing, peaceful was the night. But now no interval of bliss I see, My hopes, my pleasures all are fled with thee. No gen'rous effort my complaints to hear, No sigh to mitigate the streaming tear. Oh wherefore shoud'st thou trust the aweful deep, Distract my soul, and give me cause to weep. To hardy seamen leave that doubtful state, Nor trust the winds with my impending fate. Methinks I see, for lovers always fear To lose the object which they hold most dear; Methinks I see the vessel mount on high, Her trembling topmasts blending with the sky: Now down she sinks immerg'd in the profound, And watry mountains form the prospect round: A sudden pannick fills the sailor's mind, Who succour seeks, but seeks in vain to find. Reels too and fro, o'erwhelmed with his fear, And like a drunkard staggers here and there: One rope half pull'd, to t'other rope he goes, Nor which to take, nor which to leave he knows. All help seems vain, vain all the help of man, The last effort, 'tis only B? can. 'Tis then I see thee bold amidst the storm, With godlike presence and majestic form; A martial comeliness adorns thy face, Peculiar mark of thy accomplish'd race: Humbly, yet warmly, thou implor'st thy God, He hears—the waves are silenc'd at his nod. [The village maids their garlands bring] The village maids their garlands bring, And April's treasures shed, The choicest sweets of new-born spring, Lie pensive o'er her head. Like them a virgin bloom she knew, Like them as soon declin'd, For love impair'd her rosy hue, And grief depress'd her mind. O born to more exalted fate, Thy absence we bemoan; Not all the splendor of the great, In half thy brightness shone. Thy honest heart, thy friendly soul, Unbiass'd and unbought, Let love be agent thro' the whole, And honour guide each thought. 'Twas great, 'twas noble to aspire, 'Twas glorious e'en to fall, You lov'd the youth whom all admire, And fell belov'd of all. Ode to the author of Pamela, Grandison and Harlowe. While from thy pen's angelic source Sublimest morals flow, To stop each mad licentious course And heav'n-born virtue shew. Thro' each illumin'd well-wrought page, While pow'rful nature glides, And ev'ry scene on life's great stage, A pleas'd review abides. Say Richardson, what wond'rous art Such sentiments inspire? Such bright celestial strokes impart, Of sympathetic fire? Sure from the realms of holy light Some cherubim descends, Assisting dictates what you write, And sacred influence lends. It must be so, no Delphic shrine, No Sybil yet of old, Such great important truths as thine, Prophetically told. Of suff'ring virtue here we find, Some elocusive tale; Fit to alarm a gen'rous mind, And bid the tear prevail. Life's gaudy pomp, the proud man's boast, Here too is finely drawn, Prov'd but an anxious toil at most, Where comforts rarely dawn. Each hallow'd maxim you lay down, To this just period bend, Virtue perpetu'l honours crown, And vice all ills attend. [Down in a scene remote from public view] Down in a scene remote from public view, From tender infancy a virgin grew, To form her, nature lavish'd boundless care, Sweet her deportment, elegant her air, Soft were her words, her sentiments refin'd, Stranger to passions of a lawless kind: These were delights inferior to her taste, Whose mind was modell'd for a nobler feast. Mark what from love unpractis'd souls endure, Love—the disease that Seymour Then a physician at Plymouth. cannot cure. I saw, approv'd, and idoliz'd the maid, My glowing passion coldly she repay'd, Hesper the star of eve' with streaming light, Spangles the sable bosom of the night. Night follows day, day follows night in vain, Nor day nor night can mitigate my pain. Where were ye nymphs, when sunbright Kitty's hate, Pronounc'd my doom, and what she spoke was fate? Left me like sorrow's monumental clay, To weep whole nights, and languish suns away. What charms superior in my rival move, Knows he like me to love, or merit love? Knows he like me, soft numbers to awake, Bid Sappho's lute, or Sion's trumpet speak? Thus hapless Spencer sung his pleasing strain, Might charm an angel—tho' he sung in vain. [Reflection that makes mortals wise] Reflection that makes mortals wise, Gives me incessant pain, From doubts that in my heart arise, Of meeting thee again Absence, an ever foe to love, The thought distracts my mind, Lest you a fairer nymph approve, And she like me prove kind. Then to my humble cot retir'd To search and wish for peace, No more with mortal charms be fir'd, Each earthly bliss shall cease. Secluded far from human sight, Attend my fleecy care, But till my eyes are seal'd in night, Thou shalt partake my pray'r. My cottage on a rising ground Hard by a friendly shade, A ruin shall the prospect bound, And greens that never fade. A murm'ring brook within my view That don't too lifeless flow, Whilst I the paths of truth pursue, Both time and chance shall know. But if thou bring'st thy heart again Untainted and sincere, I'll laugh at all my present pain, And banish ev'ry care. Then like the wretch by tempest tost, I'll hail the welcome shore, Forget the various dangers past, But venture out no more. [Leaving the grammar for his play] Leaving the grammar for his play, Forgetful of the rod, Tott'ring on stilts thro' mire all day, The school-boy stroles abroad. Why does this innocent delight Provoke the pedant's spleen? Fool, round the world exert your sight, And honour this machine. The tricking statesman, propt by these, His virtues loud can boast, On gilded stilts can when he please, O'er stride the murm'ring host. Thro' fields of blood the hero stalks, And fame sits on his hilt, Till fortune throws within his walks An honourable stilt. When quite deserted by his muse, The sinking sonneteer, Hammers in vain what verse to chuse, To please Belinda's ear. Tho' mighty void of wit he stops, With one successful chime, His verse on stilts poetic props, And leans upon his rhyme. With well dissembl'd anguish see, The canting rascal beg, His artful limbs a better fee, Than is his real leg. Yet on the boys instructive play, Is this contrivance built; The source that feeds the wretch all day, What is it—but a stilt? Corinna fair, of stature low, Yet this defect supplies, Her heels like stilts assist we know The conquests of her eyes. See in his second childhood faint, Old Gripus walks in pain, Crutches removing his restraint, He acts the boy again. So well concerted is this art, It suits with all conditions, The buck, the bard, the blood, the smart, Old men and politicians. Thro' ev'ry scene of life that's past, Each artist struts unhurt, But death trips up the stilts at last, And leaves them in the dirt. [This strain young Colin oft rehears'd] This strain young Colin oft rehears'd, Amidst the laurel glade, The nymph that shunn'd the god of verse, Yet gave the bard her shade. Ye dying gales, full oft my sighs Have plum'd your airy flight, Tho' false as Kitty's heart and eyes, Oh! waft these strains aright. Tell the exulting fair, no more I'll wear her galling chains, Free as the swallow's wing I'll soar, And dare be man again. No longer chide the slow-pac'd hour, Each hour an age of woe, No longer haunt the cyprus bow'r, Or swell the river's flow. No longer rob the raven's wing To write th'ungrateful maid, Nor call sweet echo from her spring, And grow like her a shade. For tho' my soul in sighs expire, My being melts in tears, Averse she scorns my chaste desire, And adamant appears. At length the captive breaks his chains, Eludes the arms of death, Enraptur'd liberty regains, And heav'n in ev'ry breath. [Since it will out, for out it must] Since it will out, for out it must, When thou shalt see me laid in dust, Whisper not to the tell-tale reeds, The foolishness of female deeds, Nor let the treach'rous zephyrs bear My weakness thro' the spicy air. The End of the First Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. [The blackest ink of fate was sure my lot] The blackest ink of fate was sure my lot, And when she wrote my name she made a blot. [For ev'ry station of a woman fit] For ev'ry station of a woman fit, Jemmat has sense, vivacity and wit; Nor let the want of stature raise a strife, In less of matter there is more of life. So di'monds polish'd into brilliants rise, And gain in lustre what they want in size. Once we confess, deluded by the throng, She lean'd to folly, but she lean'd not long. By nature lively, she grew wild by art, For sure it was so pretty to be smart. But soon recov'ring, flush'd with mirth and youth; Contented she came home to sense and truth. Of ev'ry foreign idle grace disarm'd, She grew herself,—she reason'd,—and she charm'd. Yet tho' she reasons, she can triflle still, With equal spirit—but superior skill. And with some change of manners and of stile, For folly laughs, when wisdom does but smile. The pertness fled,—the liveliness remains, She then diverted,—now she entertains, With lively humour and with easy sense; Not at her neighbour's, or her own expence. But nice reflections on the present cast; And modest censures on the follies past. Shy to decide, tho' ready to discern, Fond to improve, yet not asham'd to learn; Her reason with the charms of fancy grac'd, She feels a relish, and she shews a taste: Her life by principle and truth she steers, Not turn'd by ev'ry whistle that she hears Like half her sex, from matrons down to girls, With eyes that twinkle and a head that twirls, Now light and giddy, now demure and prim, All pride and passion, prejudice and whim; Her heart still regularly taught to beat, Is warm'd with nature, not with passion's heat; With her own sorrows apt to swell or flow, With gen'rous pity for another's woe; While friendship, piety, compassion move, And ev'ry tender sentiment of love. Yet love's admittance too was gain'd but slow, He was a stranger only—not a foe; Her heart was to be won, but at her price, She was not so insensible as nice: Thus ev'ry virtue shining in its place, And ev'ry virtue follow'd by a grace; She claims our praises—Are our praises due? The picture charms us—Is the picture true? All poets rant, their fancy is their law, They colour brightly what they falsely draw; Or grant that one in twenty speaks his mind, He may not flatter, yet he may be blind; Some praise with art, who cannot judge with skill, And many flourish, who can reason ill; Jemmat, your worth the writer's same insures, He drew the picture, made the picture yours. Shew to the women how their glories sink, Shew to the men, a woman dares to think; Till all confess, discov'ring whom I paint, The image faithful, tho' the copy's faint. [In disappointment not unskill'd] In disappointment not unskill'd, My mind in search of pleasure roves, With hopes of happiness beguil'd, Tow'rd ev'ry fond amusement moves. But fond amusements all are vain, Enchanting Kitty to obtain. Free from ambition's restless fire, My humble soul cou'd live at ease, Nor can the thirst of gold inspire A wish injurious to my peace, Honour and wealth in vain alure, A heart contented to be poor. Not the whole world with all its charms, Cou'd my regardless heart entice, Beauty alone my heart disarms, Proof 'gainst the other baits of vice. Yet here my lovely Kitty's name, Inspires me with the purest flame. Pleasures in these soft colours drest, Attract my unexperienc'd eyes; Until within my youthful breast, Warm thoughts and expectations rise. And with delusive hopes controul, Each wish of my unwary soul. Thus while on earthly bliss my mind Is fix'd, with fancy'd joy elate, Too soon alas my hopes I find, Dash'd by some sudden stroke of fate. My expectations all are vain, I only rise to fall again. No more weak youth direct thy aims, To that which thou can'st never know, A love so pure heav'n only claims, Unrival'd by the joys below, There, there, thou'lt find, what here thou'lt miss, A lasting and substantial bliss.— To Mrs. Jemmat. In thee to blow the flow'r of human kind, Sure ev'ry star and ev'ry pow'r combind, From the full source of whose diffusive heart, Stream the rich currents of each polish'd art, While virtue, sweetness, elegance and grace, Breaths in thy mind, and lives upon thy face. Oh might my verse assume a strain divine, Soft and obliging, as each act of thine, The flowing tinctures of a deathless lay Shou'd all thy excellence of soul display. Thee bounteous heaven, indulgent sent to teach, The summit female eminence cou'd reach; And bid your manners, sense and judgment soar, A pitch unknown to all your sex before. 'Tis thus the princely eagle wings his way, Tow'rds the fix'd orbit of resplendent day. The smaller species of the feather'd race, A while attend him thro' the liquid space. Till soon fatigu'd, reluctant they give o'er, Behold astonish'd, but aspire no more, While he undaunted traces spheres unknown, And views the planetary world alone. Ambitious nymphs by whom perfections sought, May emulate thy dignity of thought. But a consummate majesty of mind, Marks you the first and best of womankind, Where dwell the pity'ng pang, the tender tear, For suff'ring innocence the sigh sincere, The spirit lib'ral, which no bounds controul, And evry social offspring of the soul. Address'd to a very beneficent Nobleman. Whether, my lord, 'tis greater pain, For you to hear or me complain, Has oft my thoughts engrost; I'm vastly troublesome, 'tis true, But still I must appeal to you, Who feels the burthen most? When various blessings you impart, It lightens, it relieves your heart, For virtue is self-pay'd; Here only the exalted mind Can feel how much it is refin'd, And see its pow'r display'd. But I, the sport of adverse fate, Existing in a world I hate, Amidst the sordid cast; Whene'er oppressive ills attend, Must first invoke that only friend, I should sollicit last. Oh with what trembling steps I come, Shame and confusion hold me dumb, Unable to reply; A thousand persecuting foes, With poignant darts the rear compose, Whene'er to thee I fly. Hear then, my lord, my last request, In earnestness of soul express'd, My future shame prevent; A slender annual pittance give, A small but certain means to live, And rest my soul content. Address'd to the right Rev. the Lord Bishop of ?. To breasts like thine paternally that share, In each vicissitude of human care, When friends and fortune from the wretched fly, To ease the heart, and wipe the streaming eye Inspires seraphic extacy of mind, Which the supremely virtuous only find; Not pride or pomp, or luxury or dress, Not all that elocution can express, Such home-felt joy and ravishment impart As warms and elevates a Christian heart. The thund'ring peal that earth's foundation shakes, Peace to the good man's conscious spirit speaks; Shews what magnificence and pow'rs attend That aweful being he esteems a friend; Commission'd angels guard his soft repose, And sweet content his fearless slumbers close: Such calm felicity, such bliss divine, Rewards bright ? a soul like thine, That holy'st sanction to religion gives, And up to each instructive precept lives. 'Tis yours with boundless hand to bring redress, When sickness, want, or nakedness oppress; The mourning widow's anguish to restrain, And kindly mitigate the orphan's pain: To see affliction at her dreadful goal, And vanquish with benevolence the soul; Thro' ev'ry step thy hallow'd master trod, To act the impartial delegate of God. To Cælia, fond of a cat. Who knows but Jove, in this disguise, Once more his deity belies; And from Olympus to thy breast Descends, to be supremely blest? Why wilt thou then, aspiring fair, Indulge the latent danger there; When, were the god confess'd, thy frame, Could not sustain his furious flame? Or grant that form thy fav'rite's own, Who thy mistake would not bemoan? Why on a brute those kisses lost, Which to enjoy e'en Jove would boast? Fair nymph, prefer the safer mean, Man comes familiarly between; Man, not so fiercy bright as Jove, Yet turn'd as happily for love: Man, far above the tabby kind, Yet of a no less humble mind.— Upon thy smiles let Strephon live, And joy at once receive and give. A picture of a good husband. Should Providence present a man of parts, Not learn'dly vain, yet skill'd in lib'ral arts; Whose principles are solid, pious too, Just to himself, and to his monarch true; In conversation grave, but not precise; Unmov'd in dangers, yet in counsel wise: His carriage humble, mix'd with decent pride, Instruct by actions, and as wisely chide; Who hates all flatt'ry, and does truth revere, Deeds prove his words, and ev'ry act sincere; One who the world's temptations can withstand, And all his passions equally command; If this uncommon creature should agree To like an honest dull sincerity, (For wit and beauty ne'er belong'd to me) I could contentedly accept the bliss, And with a pleasure know no will but his. Wrote in a young lady's Milton. Had our first parent known but to controul, And guide, like you, the passions of the soul; In vain had Satan all his arts essay'd; Virtues, like yours, would scorn to be betray'd. Then no such thoughts had Milton's breast inspir'd, Nor you, nor I, his tender lines admir'd: Then learn from hence this female vice to shun, Search not too far, by this was Eve undone. A new simile for young batchelors. As when a mouse that quits her cell, Attracted by the tempting smell Of dainties cleanly Nan has drest, And guarded for to-morrow's feast, Unfortunately meets her fate, By sliding thro' the wiry grate To gain the well-dissembled bait: So the found youth, whose easy heart Falls a quick prey to Delia's art, Despairs, impatient, 'till his rage Finds entrance into wedlock's cage;— Then cancels all the vows he swore, And wonders how he could adore: Like Mus laments lost liberty, And the same fate must set him free. On Chance and Predestination. Three diff'rent schemes philosophers assign; A Chance, a Fate, a Providence divine. Which to embrace of these three diff'rent views, Methinks it is not difficut to chuse; For first, what wisdom, or what sense to cry Things happen so and so, we know not why? Or how are we advanc'd one jot, to know, When things once are, that they must needs be so? To see such order, and deny all laws, Feel such effects, and yet confess no cause, What can be more extravagant and odd? He only reasons, that believes a God. On the May morning. The summer's morn unveils her eyes, And darksome shades dispels away; The dawning glade shines round the skies, And Phœbus smiles at new-born day. Around his orb, the blushing east, With rosy streaks, bedecks his rays; Refulgent thus, he mounts from rest, And all his radiant beams displays. Intensely swift he circling moves Around the skies with flaming blaze; The great creator, God above, Each day renews his constant race. Now pearly dews each flower spreads, And early flocks from coverts rise; The verdant lawn they sporting tread, While western gales around 'em sighs. The lark, with chearful voice on high, Soars up the ætherial way; And views the far extended sky, With songs to greet the happy day. The lusty swains their cottage leave, And to their fleecy flocks repair; And tune their pipes till dusky eve, Diurnal with the tender care. Bright Phœbus, now, the dew exhales, And chears the fainting languid flowers; And smiling nature decks the vales, Around the shady ambient bowers. The feather'd tribes their voices raise, Concordant with each other sing; And whilst they love, they strive to praise Their Maker, heav'n's eternal king! The trees expand their leaves around, All in their bloom, and gay attire; And sylvan maids with garlands crown'd, At thy approach, when love inspire. The purling rills, and flow'ry meads, Their yielding beauties spring around; And nature all her sweetness spreads, O'er the enamell'd vernal ground. Extensive God! supreme essence! Of nature's bounteous blooming store, To thee I laud thy excellence, And sing of thy almighty pow'r! To Miss ? in the country. From town where nought but spleen and spite, And scandals dire prevail, My muse retreats, and in her flight, To you directs her tale. To you who free from hateful strife, Pass the gay hours away, Enjoying still new sweets of life With each suceeding day. Whilst we involv'd in broils and feuds, Of evils sure the worst: So fill'd with idiots, pimps, and prudes, We're doom'd to be accurs'd, Pandora's box, I must confess, I think was open'd here; For where's the place from east to west, Where greater plagues appear? Whilst ?, happy, happy place, With joyous concord rings; There scandal dares not shew her face, Nor spread her sable wings, But all is calm, serene and gay, Quite free from care and strife; Grant me, ye gods, while live I may, Just such a scene of life. The Choice. A man that's neither high nor low, In party or in stature; No noisy rake, or fickle beau, That's us'd to cringe and flatter. And let him be no learned fool, That nods o'er musty books; Who eats and drinks, and lives by rule, And waves my words and looks. Let him be easy, frank, and gay, Of dancing never tir'd; Always t'have something smart to say, But silent if requir'd. The Lover's Resolve. Enrag'd with Delia's coy disdain, Despairing Damon swore, He'd now dispel his am'rous pain, Nor think on woman more. But first each pledge of former love, Each present he'd reclaim, Then hastens to the neighbouring grove, And thus address'd the dame: False fair, thou know'st that taper crook, That faithful dog that guards thy flock, That scrip too, once were mine; But since my love unheeded dies, Since you no more the giver prize, His love and gifts resign. With milder mein and smoother brow, And well dissembled sighs, The fair one meets her shepherd now, And blushing thus replies: Whate'er thy fickle fondness gave, Thine avarice back again shall have: But oh! remember, swain, With ev'ry gift a kiss you join'd, Be then those kisses now resign'd; Nor will I aught retain. Thus saying, to the youth she flew, Around his neck her arms she threw, Her lips to his applied; Her swelling bosom press'd to his, Infus'd her soul at ev'ry kiss, And quite forgot her pride. With raptures, joyful Damon hears His bliss too great to bear: Then thus with fault'ring voice he chears, The penitential fair: Forgive, my love, my life, my joy, Forgive thy rude ill-manner'd boy, Who dar'd his grief display: My crook, my flock, my all be thine! Let this, my fair, be only mine, To love and to obey. Genius, Virtue, and Reputation. As Genius, Virtue, Reputation, Three worthy friends o'er all the nation, Agreed to roam; then pass the seas, And visit Italy and Greece: By travel to improve their parts, And learn the languages and arts; Not like our modern fops and beaus, To improve the pattern of their cloaths: Thus Genius said,—“Companions dear, “To what I speak incline an ear: “Some chance, perhaps, may us divide; “Let us against the worst provide, “And give some sign, by which to find “A friend thus lost, or left behind. “For me, if cruel fate should ever “Me and my dear companions sever, “Go, seek me 'midst the walls of Rome, “At Angelo's, or Raphael's tomb; “Or else at Virgil's sacred shrine, “Lamenting with the mournful Nine.” Next Virtue pausing;—(for she knew The places were but very few, Where she could fairly hope to stay Till her companions came that way:) “Pass by (she cry'd) the court, the ball, “The masquerade and carnival, “Where all in false disguise appear, “But vice, whose face is ever bare; “'Tis ten to one I am not there. “Cælia, the loveliest maid on earth! “I've been her friend, e'er since her birth; “Perfection in her person charms, “And virtue all her bosom warms; “A matchless pattern for the fair; “Her dwelling seek, you'll find me there.” Cry'd Reputation, “I like you, “Had once a soft companion too; “As fair her person, as her fame, “And Coquetissa was her name. “Ten thousand lovers swell'd her train; “Ten thousand lovers sigh'd in vain: “Where'er she went, the danglers came; “Yet still I was her favourite flame. “Till once,—('twas at the public show) “The play being done, we rose to go; “A thing, who long had ey'd the fair, “His neck stiff-yoak'd in solitaire, “With clean white gloves, first made approach, “Then begg'd to lead her to her coach: “She smil'd, and gave her lilly hand; “Away they trip it to the Strand: “A hackney coach receiv'd the pair, “They went to ? but I won't tell where. “Then lost she reputation quite: “Friends take example from that night, “And never leave me from your sight. “For oh! if cruel fate intends “Ever to part me from my friends, “Think that I'm dead; my death deplore, “But never hope to see me more! “In vain you'll search the world around; “Lost reputation's never to be found.” The Heron. A tale for the old maids. A Her'n erect, with stately stride, Was coasting by a river's side; Where gilded carps, in limpid stream, Sported before him, in the gleam; And lordly pikes courted his taste, He needed only stoop to feast: But hoping something nice would offer, Dainty, he slights the present proffer: Not long, but appetite restor'd, Draws him again down to a ford; Here the firm, slimy tench he found, (But nothing better all around) Such low repast with scorn refus'd, Thus proudly with himself he mus'd:— What, tench for me! such wrethed stuff Might serve an otter well enough; But herns thus low to condescend, Like city-mouse with country friend! Unmov'd, he views the homely fare, Nor thinks it worth a single care: The tench swim off.—The gudgeons next Approach our hero—now perplext; But he, who scorn'd their betters so, Scorns them—and lets the gudgeons go; And now all's gone, both good and bad; (A fin on no terms to be had) Poor long-shanks, seeing no great choice, Knew 'twas a folly to be nice; And so, to make his supper sure, Eat snails like any epicure. The lady's resolve. Whilst thirst of praise, and vain desire of fame, In ev'ry age is ev'ry woman's aim; With courtship pleas'd, of silly toasters proud, Fond of a train, and happy in a crowd; On each poor fool bestowing some kind glance, Each conquest owing to some loose advance; While vain coquets affect to be pursu'd, And think they're virtuous, if not grossly lewd; Let this great maxim be my virtue's guide; In part she is to blame that has been try'd; He comes too near, that comes to be deny'd. The gentleman's answer. Whilst pretty fellows think a woman's fame, In ev'ry state and ev'ry age the same; With their own folly pleas'd, the fair they toast, And where they least are happy, swear they're most; No difference making 'twixt coquet and prude; And her that seems, yet is not really lewd; While thus they think, and thus they vainly live, And taste no joys but what their fancies give. Let this great maxim be my action's guide, May I ne'er hope, tho' I am ne'er deny'd; Nor think a woman won, that's willing to be try'd. To-morrow. Thoughtless on fate, tho' of its essence sure, View man the bound'ries of his state explore; The soft, delusive sweets of life avail, To charm (just for a while) the sense of all; In some they raise a discontented mind, In some corrupted, and in some refin'd. Harden'd thro' crimes impenitently gay, See here a man bewilder'd in delay; From time to time defers his mending hour; Bold in his vice, he thinks himself secure. To-morrows with to-morrows blended lye, All his defects to-morrow must supply. To-morrow comes, is but a common day: His sins predominant must still delay. Thus endless series of whole years may fly, To-morrow he's to mend, to-morrow he's to dye; At last cold death approaches with her aweful train, Clasps our bold hero, who submits with conscious pain, To-morrow he wishes, being now too late, to save, Withdraws into the confines of the sleepy grave. Thus liv'd, thus dy'd, and left sufficient ground to say, There's no to-morrow, 'tis happy there is to-day. Wrote on seeing some flowers blow in an apartment. What then will Flora bless my humble cell, And spread her op'ning fragrance to the sun; Deigns she with sighs, with solitude to dwell, And bless the precincts of a wretch undone. Yes, see the pink her beauties wide unfold, She courts not fortune, nor her silken smile; She comes unbrib'd by insolence or gold, Too chaste for human cunning to beguile. Parent of nature, undissembing good, Author of all the comforts thou hast lent, Let but thy mercies well be understood, Then who shall find an hour for discontent. Address'd to a gentleman on seeing his gardens and improvements. Behold the pow'r of elegance and taste, Awake to harmony the dreary waste, Where'er I tread, spontaneous beauties rise, And new form'd wonders captivate my eyes. Is it a scene in paradise I view? Or is Amphion's pow'r devolv'd to you? That rocks and woods, and waters should be taught, A prompt obedience to each happy thought. Whether I wander thro' the artless shade, Where nature's simplest aspect is display'd; Or fill'd with wild imagination, rove Amidst the fragance of thy orange grove; Whether yon Gothic temple I survey, Or mark the waters trickling in their way, My tongue and pen ambitiously contend, One to describe, the other to commend. From such divine improvements we may find Sure means to judge of an accomplish'd mind, Where all the sweets of each remoter land Stand here compil'd by a judicious hand. Address'd to a lady who had two lovely boys. She comes, immortal pleasures to impart, Love in her looks, and honour in her heart, She comes, attended by her native train, That sportive cupids emulate in vain, Those blooming boys, whose lineaments proclaim The long illustrious race from whence they came; Belov'd by all, majestic she appears, Emitting lustre thro' a veil of tears. EPIGRAM. [All agree that a poet can seldom get bread] All agree that a poet can seldom get bread Till age has destroy'd ev'ry tooth in his head, Then why should I be in the dumps; From the maxim 'tis clear, My preferment is near, Since mine are all worn to the stumps. On the death of the Right Hon. Henry Pelham, Esq Say Pelham, say, what now avails thy toil, Thy constant watchings o'er the midnight oil; To read the grave historian's labour'd page, To admire the raptur'd bard, or thoughtful sage; Could all thy knowledge stop thy parting breath? Could all thy grandeur charm the eye of death? Ah no! it could not charm no more than save, 'Tis virtue only triumphs o'er the grave. 'Twas she, kind goddess, soften'd ev'ry care, Allay'd thy anger and dispell'd thy fear, She grac'd thy life, she bid thee bravely die, And guides thee to immortal joys on high. An Acrostick on my brother's going to sea. When tempests with their thousand horrors rise, Inspect th'impending ruin not with eyes Loaded with tears; but when destruction's near Look on and slight it with intrepid air; In gulph of dread uncertainty ne'er know A passion that does in cowards glow; Mindful of heav'n, and that that heav'n design'd, Yield to its providential care resign'd; Eternal gods to them submission show, Oft think on them, as we on thee poor Yeo. By a young gentleman on the death of my brother. To whom shall I my labouring breast disclose, Reveal my tortures, and disclose my woes; To thee, dear Lycidas, surviving friend, To me thy aid, thy pen, thy muses lend; While I in faithful, tho' in humble strain, Deplore my loss, and of the fates complain; No more in pleasing themes the muse delights, Now sadly murmuring, trembles as she writes. Far different thoughts must now my pen employ, And into deepest anguish turn my joy; Let love a while be banish'd far away, Whilst I the last sad debt of friendship pay. Ye virgins listen to this tale of woe, And let the tender tears of sorrow flow; You who once knew the dear departed youth, That he was all made up of love and truth: But oh, the brightest virtues cannot save Their lovely owner from the insatiate grave. For you, ye fair, there may be some amends, All men are lovers, 'tis but few are friends; Your shock of sorrow may in time decline, Time may assuage your grief, but never mine; You for new lovers may new smiles put on, But I for no such friend now he is gone. Who does not mourn this youth's unhappy date, What heart but melts with pity for his fate; Farewell too little and too lately known, Whom I began to think and call my own. Have I not cause, relentless heaven, to mourn; Did ever breast with purer friendship burn, Did ever youth so beautiful appear, Did ever branch so sweet a blossom bear: Death view'd his beauties with unfriendly eyes, Stept proudly forth and snatch'd the glorious prize; Thus does the lovely rose its sweets dispense, Fair to the eye and pleasing to the sense: Till hoary winter with its icy arms, Nips the fair bud and rifles all its charms. Behold his weeping sisters first appear, For ever torn from what they held so dear; Adorn'd with cypress shades and springing flowers, Shining thro' tears, like April suns in showers; And great must be that merit which can draw Streams from the loveliest eyes that ever saw. Lo there she sits, and silent as she crys, A chrystal flood of tears bedew her eyes; Tears which would melt a heart even free to view, How then must mine that's conquered bleed anew: Conquer'd by thee dear maid, some pity shew, Restrain those tears, ah! still alas they flow, Compassion, love, and friendship all combine, Can I resist? no, I'll for ever pine, Sad luxury of grief how will I rove, From sorrow still, to circling sorrow move, From endless glory, kindlest endless love. But why thy untimely fate should we deplore, Sure we shall meet when once this life is o'er; Where op'ning scenes of wonder charm the view, And the soul springs to joys for ever new. Heav'n only calls him to the realms above, To teach the cherubims how they should love. But hark! what voice is that invades my ears? A voice which bids me cast away my fears; Sure I should know the form, so young, so gay; Yes, 'tis his shade, and thus it seems to say: Lament mistaken friend my fate no more, I'm safely landed on a happier shore, And blest to full perfection I can now With pity view whate'er I left below; Indulge no more this sad complaining voice, Nor by intemperate grief disturb my joys. He spoke no more, but wing'd away his flight To the bright mansions of eternal light. Sent to me with a nosegay the latter end of the season. Accept, my fair, this latter bloom, And lay it on thy breast, Where angels would delight to come, Could they be half so blest. Go happy nosegay, sweet as May, To Kitty's sweeter bosom go, And whilst amidst her charms you lay, My secret passion let her know. Sent to Mr. H. by an old gentleman, at the time he courted me. Adam alone could not be easy, But he must have a wife, an't please you; But how did he procure this wife To chear his solitary life? Why from a rib out of his side Was form'd this necessary bride; And how did he the pain beguile? Pho, he slept sweetly all the while: But when the rib was re-apply'd In woman's form to Adam's side, How then, I pray you, did it answer? He never slept so sweet again Sir. Sent me by Mr. S. How long I thought the nights and days When absent from my fair, Who can recount the many ways I strove to ease my care; Sometimes by music's softest charms I try'd to ease my pain, But that gave way to mighty love, Like me its conquer'd swain; At first I thought all things combin'd To wound my tender breast, And that conspiring fates design'd To rob me of my rest; But soon I found I had mistook, And that was not the cause; 'Twas reason had her throne forsook, To stoop to Cupid's laws; But when I did reflect again On all her pow'rful charms, The hopes, the fears, the pleasing pain, When folded in her arms; Then like a lover that pursues The thing he ought to fly, And prizes what's no loss to loose, Just so did foolish I.
