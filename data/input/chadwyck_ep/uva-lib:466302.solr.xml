      <field name="fulltext">Here sylvan touches brighten sacred lays: Nature lends colour, Grace melodious praise. To The Right Honourable and Most Reverend William Thomson, D. D., Lord Archbishop of York, This Volume is, by His Grace's kind permission, Respectfully dedicated. [To The Right Honourable and Most Reverend William Thomson] If in the multitude of public cares And lofty duties which attend thy way, Thine hand perchance should hold a blooming spray, Which lately fluttered in sweet morning airs; Touched by the fragrant message that it bears From peaceful solitudes, thou mightest say, âA simple flower can cheer the burdened day, And rest the wearied spirit unawares:â Then for a poet's privilege I pray, To place this garland underneath thine eye, Fresh from the fields and woods in which I stray; Ambitious that amid thy labours high Haply the blossom of some rural lay Might waken soothing thoughts of earth or sky. To the Reader. In wood and lane I wander free And gather flowers from bank or tree; And with a loving hand entwine The hawthorn, rose, and eglantine; And here I bring the wreath to thee. Thy happy lot it may not be To see the lark spring from the lea; Or breathe the dewy odours fine In wood and lane. But there are other fields Divine, Which in dim city may be thine; Where thou the Flower of flowers mayst see, And catch the Spirit's melody; Nor thine alone, but also mine In wood and lane. Londesborough Rectory, East Yorkshire, 1878. GRACE. The snowdrop round it throws A bright and cheery smile, But lingers like the snows A very little while. The violet lifts its head And sweetly looks around, But soon its bloom is shed, Its fragrance is not found. The yellow primrose peeps In many a sheltered lane, But soon to darkness creeps: We seek its light in vain. Not so with Heavenly Grace: Wherever it takes root, It holds its steadfast place And blossoms into fruit. Its vesture is Divine; A snowdrop white and fair, Grace comes from Heaven to shine In this terrestrial air. But still it keeps its eye Fixed on yon arch of blue, And catches from the sky A soft celestial hue. And soon it will behold Awaiting it above A crown of lustrous gold Wreathed with immortal love. Lord, plant Thy grace in me; So all the world will own, When once the flower they see That Thou the seed hast sown. THE WIND AT MIDNIGHT. O wind, that moanest at the midnight hour Around my chamber, what is thy desire? Now whispering low and ready to expire, Now waxing louder with a fitful power. What wouldest thou? Whence thy mysterious dower To thrill the darkness like a trembling lyre; Or wake sweet music, now far off, now nigher, As of some heavenly bird in secret bower? O Wind, O Bird, I know Thee whence Thou camest, And what soft message lurks beneath Thy wing: When earth is hushed in silence, then Thou claimest With plaintive tones an audience for the King: Speak, Lord, I hearâOh, let Thy Holy Dove Soothe my lone heart with whispers of Thy love. SIGNS OF SUMMER. âAnd He spake to them a parable; Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they now shoot forthâ (âwhen his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leavesâ âS. Matt. xxiv. 32), âye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at handâ (âeven at the doorsââS. Matt.). âS. Luke xxi. 29â31. On the fig-tree vernal And on âall the trees,â Precious fruit eternal Faith's keen vision sees. When the branch is tender, And the budding stem; And each shootlet slender Shows its emerald gem; Then ye know that Summer Must be very near, With each bright new-comer Of the full-blown year. Soon the punctual swallow, And the turtle's voice, On soft wings will follow, Bidding earth rejoice; Morns of dewy pleasure Scatter blooms around, Beauty without measure, Gladness without bound. So when every token In the earth and sky, Which the Lord hath spoken Meets your watching eye; Then, ye may be certain, Dawns the day of doom; He will rend the curtain, And His Kingdom come. Yet to saints, remember, That decisive day Comes, not like December, Clad in stern array, But in all the glory Of a Summer-noonâ Songs and painted story Of the flowery June. Oh, the joy, the singing! Oh, the fadeless blooms! Summer-gladness bringingâ When His Kingdom comes. Now, Lord, send Thy Spirit To my wintry breastâ Pledge I shall inherit That celestial rest, Those sweet songs and roses In Thy Kingdom fair, Where Thy Church reposes Fanned with Summer air! THE VOICE OF OUR CHURCHES. SUGGESTED BY THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK'S SERMON AT THE RE-OPENING OF THE SOUTH TRANSEPT OF YORK MINSTER. âAbide with us, O Lord, our heart's desire, For shadows gather round earth's evening hour.â Such voice, methinks, goes up from Minster tower, From village steeple and from city spire, Loud-clashing belfry and harmonious choir. To Heaven they speak with an appealing power, Our myriad churches, shining with the dower Of Art's adornments, and Devotion's fire. âAbide with us!â unceasingly they cry, âAs through the ages past. The world grows old: The love of many waxes faint and cold: But still we lift our faithful hands on high, And feeling after Thee up the dim sky, Upon Thy cloudy skirts would fain lay hold!â THE PLAIN OF YORK FROM THE YORKSHIRE WOLDS. We gazed upon a mighty sunlit plain Which swept, to right and left, the horizon's bound: In its wide arms was many a battle-ground, But at its heart a glorious Minster-fane. The sky was bright, and a melodious rain Fell from the soaring larks, with silvery sound: No note of discord in the air was found, Nor on the landscape's face one marring stain. Thus, while we sojourn in this world of strife May love to God be still the central thought Which sweetly rules and permeates our life: Thus, may our soul with light and peace be fraught, And all our days with grateful music rifeâ An echo from angelic voices caught! PATRINGTON CHURCH. âTHE QUEEN OF HOLDERNESS.â They toiled the God of Heaven to glorify With lavish ornament of nave and choir, And lofty tower that shoots into a spire Of queenly grace, conspicuous far and nigh. But lo! that slender shaft against the sky, Rosed by the dawn or tipped with sunset fireâ Of home-bound sailors is the dear desire And through the shoals of Humber guides their eye. Those patient builders reared a stately shrine For the sweet sacrifice of praise and prayer, And earthly use grew from a work divine; So the pure life that breathes celestial air And points to Heaven, for man will also shine, A star of comfort 'mid the waves of care! THE SHEPHERD'S REED. âAnd the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? And to what are they like? They are like unto children sitting in the market place, and calling one to another; and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not wept. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. The Son of Man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.â âS. Luke vii. 31â34. O Son of Man, great Shepherd of the sheep, Thou pipest to us, shall Thy children weep? Sheep of Thy pasture, shall we not rejoice, And dance to Thy soft notes and gentle voice? No strain so sweet e'er flowed from Grecian lute, Or pipe of Arcady, or Dorian flute; Of Roman lyre no mention shall be made, And David's harp before this reed must fade. A simple reed by Syrian waters found From human lips took a celestial sound; Through it strange melodies our Shepherd blew, And wondering, wistful ones around Him drew. Of heavenly love with cadence deep it told, Of labours long to win them to the fold, Of bleeding feet upon the mountains steep, And life laid down to save His erring sheep. O loving Shepherd, to that gracious strain We listen and we listen once again, And while its music sinks into our heart, Our fears grow fainter and our doubts depart. Lord, pipe to me, and I will weep no more, But joyful follow to yon happy shore, Where my glad soul shall sing and dance to Thee In the âgreen pasturesâ of Eternity! ON THE LARGE COPY PAINTED BY SELOUS OF LEONARDO DA VINCI'S âLAST SUPPER,â IN THE DINING-ROOM OF MY FRIEND, THE REV. C. F. NORMAN, MISTLEY PLACE, MANNINGTREE. No shadow falls upon the festive room From that pathetic sceneâthat clouded Face Bent on the board with melancholy grace. That glorious picture sheds no touch of gloom, But rather a soft radiance to illume The banquet, as upon the wall we trace The symbol of a happier time and place, When at Heaven's feast immortal flowers shall bloom. âJesus and His disciplesâ let us âcallâ To bless and beautify our brightest hours, And breathe a chastened gladness over all: Thus will He call us to those festal bowers, Where no fair pictured form shall meet the view, But His own Selfâthe Living, Loving, True. BEECH-LEAVES, SNOW, AND VIOLETS. To-day I saw fresh violets blow 'Twixt withered leaves and lingering snow, Autumn above, Winter below, With Spring contending: There lie the beech-leaves brown and sere, The whiteness of the snow is here, Between them purple blooms appear, Their odours blending. Thus, yielding not to dead regrets, Or wintry trouble which besets The presentâlike the violets Our lives shall borrow A brightness for the passing hour From trust in that Almighty Power Which bids us, like the thriftless flower, Fear no to-morrow. Like Autumn leaves joys pass away, And storm-clouds vex us day by day, Present and past have much to say Our souls to sadden: But simple trust will still find grace To sweeten and adorn its place And show a calm, contented face The world to gladden. Then let us leave the past behind, And meet the present with a mind Which breathes a fragrance on the wind Of tribulation: Care, like unseasonable snow, Soon melts before the purple glow Which violets of hope will throw Round any station. AN AUTUMN DAY AT FOUNTAINS' ABBEY. âA perfect day!â we cried, âA perfect day!â As round fair Fountains' winding walks we strayed, Where yellowing leaves and mouldering arches made The valley rich with beautiful decay. The world-famed jewel of those ruins grey Was grandly set in gold and crimson shade; The sylvan glories dazzle as they fade; The crumbling Abbey smiles itself away. âAlas!â I murmured, âthat this earth of ours To wasting Time should its perfection owe, And the brief splendour of autumnal bowers:â But down Faith's vista, then I caught the glow Of fairer landscapes, more enduring towers, And deeper, truer joys than mortals know. TO MRS. CHARLES TENNYSON TURNER. O âLady,â art thou not âelectââto stand And daily minister to one so dear, Who, with his sweet-toned Muse, has won the ear Of many a loving listener through the land: Whose Sonnet-lyre, touched with a cunning hand, Has wakened dulcet echoes, soft and clear, Destined to wander on from year to year, Nor ever fail âfit audienceâ to command. Well may it all thy pious care engage Our fragile Songster to defend from harm, And keep him prisoner in his mortal cage: That still with measured music he may charm The cultured sense, till seasonable age Lays his tired head on an Almighty arm! TO SOME FRIENDS The Rev. Henry Sandwith, M. A., Vicar of Thorpe Salvin, Notts., and Mrs. Sandwith. ABOUT TO WINTER AT CANEA, IN CRETE. O happy, flying to the shores of Crete, From England to the hundred-citied isle, Like the blest birds which follow Summer's smile. What footprints of Old Time your eyes will meet Where classic Ida lifts its head to greet The clustered Cyclades. What thoughts beguile Th' approach to âevery cityâ Titus i. 5. mile by mile, Once tracked by grand Evangelistic feet. Nor blest alone, but blessing will ye go: For on that far-off strand an English home Shines amid alien flowers, warm with the glow Of English hearts, to welcome those who roam: And oh, what genial hours will o'er ye flow, Gazing tow'rds Greece across the Ãgean foam. WINTER-BERRIES. No blossoms now adorn this ruined bower, Nor any leaves. The wind relentless blows Right through the naked branches, which disclose The mossy secret plann'd in happier hour By some fair bird. But Winter has its dower, And many a dainty bead and coral showsâ These clustered berries ruddier than the rose, And gaily dancing, though the storm-clouds lower. Thus o'er the leafless boughs bright wings still flutter, Nor miss the blossoms mid the fruitage red; For which sweet voices, silent now, will utter Melodious thanks when these dark days are fled: Oh, may the Winter of my age be found With timely fruits of ripe experience crowned. THE ARROW-SEED; OR, SOWING UNAWARES. I watched a little bird that unawares With all its might was scattering wingÃ¨d seed, As on a nodding flower it hung to feed. Loosed by its beakâthe breath of Summer airs Those feathered germs across the meadow bears, The while the busy songster takes no heed Whither each arrowy wanderer may speed, Or how in forest or in field it fares. Ah, we are sowing when we little think Wing'd seeds of good or evil all around; We scatter them e'en when we eat or drink; Whene'er we talk they flutter o'er the ground: Oh, âto the Spiritâ let us learn to âsow,â And from small deeds and words fair flowers will grow! THE VICTIM AND THE PRIEST. When as a Lamb, harmless and undefiled, He faced the High-priest's rage with patience mild, Though words, like poisoned arrows, did not cease To fly around Him, âJesus held His peace.â When to His Judge, who bent a scornful look, The Jews their bitter accusations took, And Pilate probed the truth of what he heard With questionsââHe replied to ne'er a word.â When before Herod and his warrior band, Arrayed in gorgeous robe He takes His stand, For all the vehement charges that they bring, âHe answered nothingâ to the mocking king. Thus dumb He stood before His shearers all, And, unresisting, let their fury fall; No word of self-defence He deigned to wield, But wore majestic silence as His shield. As Isaac on the altar speechless lay, When the knife gleamed to take his life away, So no excusing voice from Jesus broke To avert His sorrow or to blunt its stroke. Long since have vanished priest, and judge, and king, As troubled dreams at dawn of day take wing; Their Victim now is on His priestly throne, And mightiest princes His dominion own. Silence now seals His gracious lips no more; He ever lives prevailing words to pour Into our Father's ear, for each and all Who at His kingly feet believing fall. To save Himself no whisper stirred the air, To save His Church He pours perpetual prayer, And pleads aloud to yonder listening skies The virtue of His silent Sacrifice! THE BIRDS' FIRST HALTING-PLACE. âMany of the migratory birds make the Devil's Dyke, near Brighton (containing a deep combe, in the Parish of Poynings) their first halt on their arrival from the Continent: but they do not stay long there; they are soon off and away. This locality is warm for them, and probably produces suitable food.â âBrighton Paper. Escaped from Ocean's highway rough and loud, Our travelled songsters light in this green vale, The whitethroat, blackcap, redstart, nightingaleâ Like showers of music, cloud succeeding cloud. In this soft cradle sinks the wearied crowd, With panting breasts, and plumes that droop and fail; But soon, their ranks reformed, away they sail, To sweep the land in feathered phalanx proud. Sweet favoured nook in which to fold your wing, Ere, like new Conquerors, ye disperse all round To seize the groves, and songs triumphant sing: Well have ye chosen your first camping ground, For One My friend the Rev. T. A. Holland, M. A., Rector of Poynings, Author of âDryburgh Abbey and Other Poems,â and of many beautiful Sonnets on our favourite birds, which have appeared in the âAnimal World,â etc. dwells near, a welcome warm to bring And with your fame bid hill and dale resound. A TIME OF REFRESHING. GLEN CRIPESDALE, LOCH SUNART. I thought to breathe the mountain air, But caught a gale from Heaven above, For lo! the Master met me there With gracious waftings of His love. I thought to hear the ripples lave The heathery rocks on Sunart's shore, But caught the music of a wave Which echoes on for evermore. I thought to hide me in a glen, Far from the haunts of busy feet; But, fairer than the sons of men, He showed to me His presence sweet. I thought with raptured ear to hail The thunder of the waterfall, But heard, behind the silvery veil, The still small whisper of His call. I sought for health and mental power To help me in my onward course, And found an unexpected dower Of peace and spiritual force. I went apart to rest awhile From the dull round of daily toil, And He refreshed me with a smile Which turns earth's tasks to golden spoil. Oh! sweet surprises of His graceâ To lure us to the eternal hill, Where He will quite unveil His face, And our immortal hopes fulfil! ON A HIGHLAND BURYING-PLACE, IN MORVEN, BY LOCH SUNART. On Sunart's lonely shore, after long quest In vain, embosomed in the hills we found An open, undistinguished plot of ground Where Morven's children take their dreamless rest. Headstones and cairns are scattered o'er the crest Of a green height, with plume-like bracken crowned; While pastured sheep repose the dead around, Who own nor date nor name nor symbol blest. But kindly Nature watches o'er those graves; The mountains fold them in their strong embrace; Fair Sunart sings to them with soothing waves; Soft rains and sunshine bless that burial place: The shepherd notes it as he wanders by; And it escapes not the Redeemer's eye. LOCH TEACHUS, BY LOCH SUNART. A loch, within a loch, girdled all round With lofty mountain and with wooded hill, Spreads out its silvery waters, lone and still, Embosomed in tranquillity profound. Only each day, with a soft lulling sound The mighty tides this rocky basin fill, And from the grassy uplands many a rill Brings its fresh tribute with a gladsome bound. Bright image of a consecrated soul, Reposing in the arms of Heavenly Love; Into its depths what tides of blessing roll, What streams of comfort cheer it from above: While Truth and Faithfulness on either hand, Like the eternal hills, serenely stand. SONNETS ON THE FATHERS. IGNATIUS. From Antioch to Rome with eager feet The rugged path of martyrdom he trod: Doomed to the lions by an emperor's nod, The lightning of their eyes he yearned to meet, And thunder of their throats; for death was sweet To one who fain would look upon his God; And so with passionate lips he kissed the rod Lifted at last to make his joy complete. The tyrant's threatening and the wild beast's roar But heralded the music of a Voice, Waiting to greet him on the peaceful shore: His direst anguish was his dearest choice, Since rending teeth the envious curtain tore, And face to face allowed him to rejoice. POLYCARP. He looked on those who looked upon the Lord, Holding familiar converse with St. John; In whom the last soft glow reflected shone From that sad Face by earth and heaven adored. In secret cells of memory he stored Sweet words and deeds of Christ, and passed them on To live in other lips when he was gone, Sealing the truths our Gospel-books record. Christ's breath through holy John still breathed on him, Fanning his heart's devotion high and higher, Which not the mists of fivescore years could dim: With ardent longings did his soul aspire Till from a rounded century's utmost rim He soared to Heaven on cherub-wings of fire. JUSTIN MARTYR. Seeking for goodly pearls from shore to shore, A Heavenly Jewel crowned his weary toil, And he rejoiced as one who finds great spoilâ Treasure which earth or ocean never bore. What were the dreams of philosophic lore To One sweet human Life without a soil? Armed with the simple Cross he now could foil Singly the dark mythologies of yore. His wreath of honour nobly did he earn, A living âwitnessâ for his dying Lord, Wrestling with Jew and Greek in learnÃ¨d strife: Nor shrank he from that last encounter stern, The fatal flashing of the Roman sword, A dying witness for the Prince of life. TERTULLIAN. O fiery Roman spiritâthat first bent The conqueror's language to the Church's use, And where the Eagle ranged the Dove let looseâ How well thy mind befits thy instrument! In iron warfare was thy lifetime spent For facts and doctrines and world-changing views Of Truth; the storm, not silence of the dews, Dear to thy heart and with thy being blent. And what if, in the fervour of the fight, Thy steps might err, through lack of zeal or love In those who fought beside thee for the Right; Still was thine eye fixed on the Lord above, Still didst thou walk beneath the Father's light, And catch the brooding of the mystic Dove. IRENÃUS. Three arches of a bridge our faith sustain O'er two dim centuries to the solid shore, Where floating myths are possible no more, And History's clear, unquestioned steps remain. By three bright links of an unbroken chainâ John, Polycarp, and the industrious lore Of IrenÃ¦usâwe are lifted o'er The chasm, and a steadfast foothold gain. From his far Western home in Christ-lit Gaul Our saint could travel back a lifetime's space, And Orient years in Ephesus recall; And how his martyred master would retrace Dear mem'ries which the lips of John let fall, Sweetly descanting of Incarnate Grace. ORIGEN. Close-linked in youth with apostolic men, And mighty in the Scriptures, thou didst raise A stately fabric of immortal praise, Based on eternal Truth, wise Origen. And though we tremble lest thy daring pen Venture too near the veil which hides God's ways, We crown with evergreen thy restless days, Thy pious insight and far-reaching ken. For ivy-like thy busy hand hath wound Unfading wreaths about the holy shrine In which the Oracles of God are found; Where Scriptures Old and New their voice combine Through all the listening ages to resound The full-toned thunder of the Word Divine! EUSEBIUS. LearnÃ¨d, devout, and liberal, he possest The heart's love of imperial Constantine; Who, dying, whispered of that luminous Sign, The Cross in heaven with which his eyes were blest; Of that repeated Vision which addrest To his uncertain faith the words divineâ âWith this Cross conquerâââLet this symbol shine A glorious standard o'er thy warrior-crest.â Thus of the Cross above Eusebius told, On the blue sky inscribed with golden glow; But his laborious chronicles unfold How that same Cross was writ in blood below, Until, through pain and prayer and witness bold, Earth saw the trampled Church to empire grow. ATHANASIUS. When Athanasius faced a frowning worldâ Emperor and priest against the truth arrayedâ He grasped the precious Pearl, nor felt dismayed, Though all earth's pride to shake him was unfurled. What if from his high station he was hurled, The jewel of the Faith he ne'er betrayed, But kept it, hidden in sepulchral shade, Or where from hermit's cell the blue smoke curled. Then, when the storm retired, the triple bow Was seen in perfect beauty on the cloud Each mingling hue defined with clearer glow; Thus through dark years of doubt and conflict loud To one man's strenuous faithfulness we owe The Creed to which all after time has bowed. THE CROSS AND THE MOSS, IN THE WEST WINDOW OF MY CHURCH. I saw red berries and the twinkling gloss Of pointed holly leaves, which ordered lay On a deep lancet-window's sloping splay; Where the stern symbol of the ensanguined Cross Reclined on a green bed of cushioned moss. I pondered on the sight. 'Twas Christmas day, And the Church smiled in festival array To welcome Him who counted all things loss That He might win our souls. Alas! I saidâ 'Tis thus we pluck the thorns from the sharp crown Which pressed upon the Saviour's drooping head: We take our cross, and softly lay it down; We love the Sign and honour it; and there We leave the burden which we ought to bear. MY PAINTED WINDOW, BEING A WEST LANCET-LIGHT IN LONDESBOROUGH CHURCH, OVERSHADOWED BY A BEECH TREE. No mortal hand, with cunning art, could paint My window; for its colour comes and goes With the revolving seasons. Now it glows Bright as the emerald robe of pictured saint: Now burns like gold: and now, through traceries quaint, Sweet sunset-touches of the ruby shows: Now the pure whiteness of the Christmas snows, Or gemmy lustres of the starlight faint. Like that fair window may my life be seen, Rich with successive graces in God's sight; Now let me serve in manhood's vigour green, Now peaceful sink in roseate evening light; Then upwards soar above yon starry sheen, And through the Golden City âwalk in white.â CHRISTMAS FARE FOR THE BIRDS. Thanking the God of Harvest we adorn The pillars of His House with flowers and leaves, And on His Table lay our votive sheaves. The garlands wither, but we store the corn, A bounty for the birds on Christmas morn. Thus, when the icy hand of Winter weaves Its wreaths of snow, and decorates our eaves With ornaments fantastic and forlorn; The sheaves we gave to God we give again To feed the birds which live beneath His eye, Raising upon a pole the mystic grain, Round which a hundred wings hover and fly; While to the God of Grace ascends on high From men and birds a grateful Christmas strain. A PRAYER FOR THE NEW YEAR. Lord, fill my life with service or with song To Thee my Master, through the gliding year; For daily praises let my voice be clear. For daily labours let my hands be strong. Thy sovereign ownership let me not wrong, Or that sweet love which cost my Lord so dear; Touch Thou my heart and tongue, mine eye and ear, Let all this breathing frame to Thee belong. Oh! may the leaves of Life's new volume shine With holy thoughts and deeds, like radiant flowers Meet for the hand and eye of Love Divine: So shall they vocal be, like vernal bowers, With songs of hope, the earnest and the sign Of that long Summer See Luke xxi. 29â31. which will soon be ours. THOUGHTS FOR NEW YEAR'S DAY. THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST. On New Year's day the God-sent Name Was spoken first o'er the âYoung Child,â His saving errand to proclaim, While yet a speechless Babe He smiled; Jesusâthat ear-alluring word, Jesusâthat âjoyful soundâ was heard. Thus on the forefront of the year, As on the high-priest's brow of yore, The Name of names is written clear; Thus Christâour Captainâgoes before, And not one day that looks to Him Can be all desolate or dim. On New Year's day the âHoly Childâ Gave the first drops of âprecious bloodâ From His fair body undefiled; Prelude of that atoning flood Which poured from hands and feet and side, When as our Paschal Lamb He died. And thus the sprinkled blood is seen Upon the lintel of the year; Days, weeks, and months flow on serene And no destroying angel fear: For who the humblest soul can harm That hides behind that crimson charm? On New Year's day the touch of pain Bedewed with tears that Infant's cheek; He suffered, though He knew no stainâ Able to weep though not to speak: Too soon the âMan of sorrowsâ found The pangs which crowd this grief-strewn ground. And thus a glittering crown is worn Upon the brow of the New Year, But it is made of twisted thorn, And every point has its own tear: âSufficient evilâ each day knows, But âgrace sufficientâ Christ bestows. May I each day of this New Year, âLook unto Jesusâ and be blest; His Name each day become more dear: His Spirit sprinkle on my breast The blood which quiets every fear, And brightens every falling tear! PALM SUNDAY. âAnd many spread their garments in the way; and others cut down branches off the trees, and strewed them in the way. And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.â âSt. Mark xi. 8â10. Behold our King in meek array Comes riding on His prosperous way, His lips distilling truth and grace, And pity sitting on His face: His willing people own the power That breathes o'er His triumphant hour, And heavenward drawn by cords of love In jubilant procession move. As He rides on His people bring Their offerings to the Saviour King; Beneath His feet their garments lay, And scatter branches in the way: With praises and hosannas loud Around Him men and children crowd, And thus the Lord is borne along As on a heaving sea of song. Lord, as Thou passest by this way My ready tribute I would pay: The deep-dyed sins which wrap me round I cast before Thee on the ground, And like a crimson garment spread, On which Thy conquering feet may tread; Knowing for raiment vile of mine Thou wilt bestow a robe divine. And Lord, before Thee I would strew Green branches wet with early dewâ The palm, the olive, and the vine, A garland sweet for Thee entwineâ All holy aspirations high, All duties aiming at the sky, The unction of prevailing prayer, And praise's cheering clusters rare. And let me join the marching crowd That gird Thee with rejoicings loud, Bringing some loved ones in my train To wave their boughs and add their strainâ Fair olive-branches clinging near In dew of youth, an offering dear: Thus as of old shall children raise Glad hand and voice to swell Thy praise. For, Lord, if we should hold our peace, Earth's adoration would not cease, The very stones would cry to Thee, And music flow from every tree. So never shall our lips be dumb Till to Thy Temple, Lord, we come, And mingle with the blissful throng Who raise to Thee the eternal song! GOOD FRIDAY. A COINCIDENCE. When the Church-tower, at the âthird watchâ forlorn With triple stroke had ushered in the day On which the Saviour trod the Dolorous Way, And meekly climbed for us the hill of scorn; Lo! the shrill warning of the bird of morn Startled the silence, as awake I lay, And bade me think how in the twilight grey Friends joined with foes to wreathe the crown of thorn. And bird and belfry seemed to me to say, âWould'st thou in word or action never grieve The Lord who died for thee, oh, âwatch and pray;â That if at midnight, cockcrow, morn, or eve, The Master comes, robed in divine array, His hand for thee a crown of joy may weave.â EASTER DAY. âTHE LORD IS RISEN INDEED.â âTHAT I MAY KNOW HIM, AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION.â The Lord is risen indeed! The chains and bars of Death are swept aside: Our debt is fully paid, our Surety freed, And we are justified. The stone is rolled away: Sin's huge obstruction is no longer seen; Our manifold transgressions are to-day As though they had not been. Wide open stands the door: Eternal Justice smiled, and it was done; The powers of darkness could prevent no more The rising of our Sun. He shows His glorious face And scatters mortal shadows with His eye: Earth is all radiant with the light of grace Beneath a cloudless sky. And still, as years roll round, Nature prepares to welcome this glad day, With early blossoms strewn along the ground And birds on every spray. His resurrection power Oh, may I feel stirring within my soul; As rising sap through all the vernal bower Quickens the sleeping bole. And oh, may I be seen Clothed in the glorious robe which justifies, As now the trees array themselves in green To greet the vernal skies. And let me hear the voice Of Peace, as of a bird, within my breast, Which sweetly sings, O weary one, rejoiceâ His righteousness thy rest. Be mine the inward seal To certify my Saviour's crowning Sign, And make me, not believe alone, but feel That Jesus is Divine. That He is risen indeed, The outward proofs are neither few nor dim: Such witness I accept, but do not needâ My heart is risen with Him! Then let my life display The Spirit's fruit of self-forgetting love, That all the world may know from day to day My Treasure is above. So, at the Trumpet's sound, My slumbering dust Christ's quickening power shall share, And rise again immortal from the ground To meet Him in the air. A PRAYER FOR WHITSUNTIDE. âAnd Jesus breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.â âJohn xx. 19â22. The breath from Thy dear mouth, Thy Spirit sweet and free, Is fragrant as the genial Southâ Lord Jesus, breathe on me! Breathe, Lord, and I shall feel Thy peace within my breast; A balmy gale will o'er me steal From Paradise the blest. Breathe, Lord, and I shall see Thy wounded hands and side; The veil which hid Thy face from me Will suddenly divide. Breathe, Lord, and I shall hear The whisper of Thy voice, Putting to flight my guilty fear And bidding me rejoice. Breathe, Lord, and power will thrill This faltering mortal frame, And clothe me with the steadfast will To magnify Thy name. Lord, breathe upon me now! Thy Spirit comes and goes Like wind upon the fluttering boughâ Its method no man knows. But, whence it comes, I knowâ From that dear mouth of Thine: Oh, hither, hither may it blow On this poor heart of mine! The gift is promised, Lord; 'Tis pledged as well as free; I hang upon Thy gracious Wordâ Lord Jesus, breathe on me! MACHÅRUS. ENGLISH TRAVELLERS AT THE CASTLE OF MACHÅRUS, THE SCENE OF JOHN THE BAPTIST'S IMPRISONMENT. I read Canon Tristram's âLand of Moab.â how that dark prison they had found Beneath the ruins of MachÅrus grey, Where John the Baptist languished many a day, And his bowed head with martyrdom was crowned. To those thrill'd travellers, methought, all round That dungeon dim a glory seemed to play; On every stone a tender radiance lay, In vaulted roof, or walls, or pavÃ¨d ground. For o'er that stonework favoured eyes had pored, And honoured feet across that floor had trod;â Eyes which had gazed with rapture on the Lord, Feet which had gone before the Incarnate God; And Earth's grand Fact more solid seemed and clear, By means of that stone-vaulted dungeon drear. LIVINGSTONE'S LAST PRAYER. On his bent knees, in attitude of prayer, They found him,âthose brave Africans; his head Bowed low between his hands upon the bed. They listened, but no voice stirred the night air; They looked, but saw no motion anywhere; Awe struck, they touched himâhe was cold and dead; His noble spirit up to Heaven had fled, And left his weary body kneeling there. And there through all the ages will he kneel, As if for his loved Africa to plead; And with his out-poured hero-life appeal To Heaven and earth till God and man give heed; And that dark continent from East to West, With rising beams of Gospel light is blest. ON THE DEATH UPON SNOWDON OF FREDERICK R. WILTON, B.A., ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, ONE OF THE MASTERS OF THE CITY OF LONDON SCHOOL. With buoyant step he climbed the mountain side, Alone, but not alone, for One On his way up the mountain he met with a gentleman, to whom among other things he said, âI never felt so near to Christ as I do on this mountain to-day.â was near Who made that misty morning bright and clear. What though no glorious prospect was descried From Snowdon's brow, but veiling clouds denied One glimpse of earthly beauty to appear; And erring footsteps down that slope of fear With awful suddenness began to slide: The Master whom he loved and served was there, To bear his spirit up, and gently show Visions of beauty infinitely fair, And glories unimagined here below. O favoured youth, to whom the bliss was given To climb a mountain and to find itâHeaven! AT HIS FEET. Mary âsat at Jesus' feet,â Luke x. 39. Rapt in contemplation sweet, Gazing up into His face, Drinking in His words of grace, By no earthly murmur moved From the posture that she loved: Lord, be this my daily choice At Thy feet to hear Thy voice. Mary âfell at Jesus' feetâ John xi. 32. When her brother, through the street By the mourners borne away, Folded in death's darkness lay; All her sorrow forth she sighed, Christ with answering groans replied: Lord, in trouble let me fall At Thy feet and tell Thee all. Mary stood at Jesus' feet, John xii. 3. Offering as He sat at meat Costly gift of spikenard rare, Glistening tears and flowing hair; Speechless love and thanks she gave To the Master strong to save: Lord, when gladness lights my days At Thy feet I'll give Thee praise. At Thy feet once pierced for me Always shall my station be; By Thy Spirit and Thy Word To Thy servant speak, O Lord; In my sorrow succour bring; Hear me when Thy praise I sing; Till 'mid Heaven's high joys at last At Thy feet my crown I cast! Rev. iv. 11. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. A hand to labour and a heart to loveâ That is my mortal destiny and dower; To âserve my generation,â hour by hour, And emulate the unselfish joys above;â A hand to minister, a heart to move The hearts of others by the gentle power Of sympathy, which opens like a flower, And soothes all discords like a brooding dove. A Hand to labour, and a Heart to bleed, In Nazareth's workshop and on Calvary's Tree: Ah, that was God-like sympathy indeed! There my example and my hope I see; A mighty Hand for every human need, And a large Heart to bless and use even me! REVOLVING YEARS. The years rush on with quick-revolving wheel; Like planets round their central sun they flyâ Obedient to the will of God Most High: Their crescent orbs to light they now reveal, And now their face in darkness they conceal. This new year, dawning fresh upon the eye, Already it begins to hasten by, And out of sunshine into shadow steal; But though the years depart, they cannot dieâ âTheir works do follow themâ in gloom or glow: The planets leave no tracks upon the sky, But the swift years will lasting footsteps show; And little words let fall for Christ below Will send their ripples through Eternity! SEARCHING THE SCRIPTURES. Wandering together in the fields Divine, We glean among the sheaves, and daily beat Out from our store the precious âCorn of Wheat,â Whose grace and truth for patient seekers shine. Working together in the sacred mine, We trace the veins of ore beneath our feet, Till riches unimaginable greet Our searching eyes, concealed in every line. Sweet is the Word that âif but two agreeâ Touching some pearl of hope they fain would find, The rich fulfilment they shall surely see; Thus then, Thy promise and our prayer combined, Shall lead us to the vision, Lord, of Thee, And more and more inform us with Thy mind. SONNETS ON THE TYPES. THE BRAZEN ALTAR. Fashioned of shining brass, God's Altar stood Four-squareâits pointed corners raised on high, Like lifted hands appealing to the sky In silence, touched with sacrificial blood. Here, through the ages, on the typic wood A myriad shadows of One Victim lie, Feeding the sire which nought could satisfy Till Calvary quenched it with a crimson flood. âWe have an Altar;â unto which we fly Guilty for refuge. Glorious, strong to endure, By faith we grasp it, and can never die; For in God's ear it speaketh mightily Of One whose sinless life and offering pure Wrought for our souls a hope Divinely sure. THE LAVER OR MOLTEN SEA. A molten sea beneath the open sky, With fruit and lilies carved around its rim, And filled with crystal water to the brim, On twelve symbolic oxen is raised highâ Which face the four winds with prophetic eye. Is it from sunset clouds that o'er it swim The water blushes, or prefiguring Him Who came to shed His precious blood and die. Lord, I would bathe me in that crimson sea, And leave it, like the lilies, white and fair, To go about and bring forth fruit for Thee, While the dear burden of Thy Name I bear; With patient labour lifting to the light The Grace which passes thought in breadth, depth, height. THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK. From suns that set or moons that change no light Entered the Holy Place; but utter gloom Pervaded that mysterious ante-room, Till from the Candlestick there burst a bright And sevenfold stream of glory, day and night; And, like a lamp that burns within a tomb, The golden branches, olive-fed, illume The darkness with a flame that soothes the sight. So not from light of Nature but of Grace The lamp of Truth, with branches manifold, Shines brightly in the Churchâearth's holy place: Oh, may it shed a lustre clear and bold, The world to illumine and the Lord to greet, Whene'er we hear approach His priestly feet! THE TABLE OF SHEWBREAD, (OR, HEBREW, BREAD OF FACES.) May gifts of mine encounter that dread Face? And will the holy eye of God endure My faulty service and account it pure? Yes, if my life and ordered works I place Upon the golden Table of His grace: Once laid in faith on that foundation sure, Of God's approving smile they are secureâ The building precious for its glorious base. Lord, I would bring Thee not the casual ears Of faint desires, but the compacted bread Of loving labour, godly toils and tears, Of consecrated heart and hand and head: Thus would I live as in Thy presence, Lord, Thy presence my âexceeding great reward.â THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE. The royal purple and the heavenly blue With mystic crimson richly intertwine, To weave a cunning veil before the shrine Of glory, all too bright for mortal view. One onlyâonce a yearâmay venture through That curtain, to behold the Light Divine. Not without blood and incenseâtwofold signâ In fear he entered and in fear withdrew. Not yet the way to the Holiest was made plain; Not yet on men might Heaven's full glory shine, Till Christ's last sigh sundered the Veil in twain; And now through His rent âfleshâ the right is mine Fearless to pass yon veil of azure hue, And bask in bliss supreme, eternal, true. MANNA. Morn after morn on Paran's grassy floor Lay Israel's pearl-like food, celestial, sweet; The dew, exhaling, left it at their feet, Circling their tents up to the very door; They only stooped to gather itâno more; No sowing, reaping, threshing of the wheatâ The corn of Heaven came down to them complete, Without their toil or cost, a bounteous store. Thus spiritual Manna now is shed Around our homes, enough for all and each, Without our labour, in abundance spread; Only let Faith her daily hand out-reach And gather for herself the Living Bread, Sweet and refreshing past the power of speech. THE BRAZEN SERPENT. I hear a sharp, âexceeding bitter cry;â I see a wild and horror-stricken crowd, Strong men and children in fierce anguish bow'dâ The writhing limb, drooped head, and filming eye. I see a symbol strange uplifted high, A coilÃ¨d serpent, like a banner proud; I hear a burst of gladness rising loud, Responsive to a look of ecstasy. I see a sinful, suffering, dying worldâ Like ocean, dark with cloud and toss'd with storm; But lo! a blood-red banner is unfurled, Which floats around a gracious, drooping Form: And through the dimness falls a mighty voice, âO earth, earth, earth, behold, believe, rejoice!â THE HYSSOP. Not to the cedar on the mountain height, But to the hyssop springing from the wall; Not to a monarch-tree, broad-branched and tall, But to a lowly herb, fragile and slight, Is faith compared. Yet hyssop, on that night When Death o'er Egypt settled like a pall, Shone as the sceptre of the Lord of all, Outstretched to guard His own with saving might. Lord, with that sacred hyssop, which could give A moment's solace to Thy mortal woe, Purge me from all my sin, and bid me live, And guard and comfort me where'er I go; I seek not high things like the cedar tree, The blood-stained hyssop is enough for me. THE RED HEIFER. What means that victim in procession led Beyond the precincts of the camp, and slain; Unmarked by servile yoke or any stain Discolouring its coat of mystic red? Soon on that holocaust the fire has fed; But stored with care its ashes still remain, And dipt in water once and once again, Like healing dews on souls defiled are shed. Lord Jesus, who âwithout the gateâ didst make Thyself an Offering, crimson, spotless, free, Now let the finger of Thy Spirit take The âwater and the bloodâ and sprinkle me; And daily show me, treasured in the skies, The abiding power of the One Sacrifice! THE SCAPEGOAT. With solemn voice the white-robed priest confesses O'er the devoted Scapegoat Israel's sin; Whileâtoken of the burden felt withinâ With heavy hands upon its head he presses. The sin-bearer departing, new hope blesses The watching, praying host. Straight they begin The peacefulness of pardoned guilt to win; Comfort Divine their thankful heart possesses. The goat has passed beyond the horizon's rim; The guilt is seen to fade away and vanish; So when the hand of faith we place on Him, Who came our myriad sins to blot and banish, Laid on our Surety's head they disappear, And all the horizon of the soul is clear. THE PASCHAL LAMB. Since Christ, our Passover, for us was slain, 'Tis our's to keep perpetual âholy day,â And with a life-long gladness praise and pray: For sin is gone, and peace and joy remain. On the heart's lintel shines the crimson stain Which keeps the fatal terror far away; Secure we rest by night and work by day, While justice sleeps, and love and mercy reign. Oh, worthy, worthy is the Lamb who stood A spotless Victim in the sinner's place, And bought our safety with His innocent blood! And precious, precious is the deathless grace Which gives His flesh to be our daily food, As faith's dim path o'er life's drear sands we trace. âLET US PASS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.â âThe same day, when the even was come, He saith unto them, âLet us pass over unto the other side.ââ âMark iv. 35, and Luke viii. 1â22. The Master, with the Twelve, through Galilee The sower's patient toil had duly plied; Gently He spake, and pointed o'er the sea, âLet us pass over to the other side.â A chain of towns girdled the western shore, Where Commerce poured her wealth with ceaseless tide, And footsteps came and went for evermore, But lonely stillness crowned âthe other side.â Thus oft with wind or oar the Lord withdrew From the loud haunts of Labour, Gain, and Pride, And on those distant mountains, out of view, Communed with God upon âthe other side.â So, mid the busy scenes of daily life, Not always on Care's shore must we abide: From toil and tumult, weariness and strife, âLet us pass over to the other side.â Our home, like Christ's, may be the noisy street, But we, like Him, will cross the waters wide, And climb the heights of meditation sweet, Where we shall meet Him on âthe other side.â Not to forsake our proper work and place, Nor in a selfish solitude to hide, But to secure fresh freights of heavenly grace, âLet us pass over to the other side.â MANSIONS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. What pen can paint those âmansionsâ The same word in the original âJohn xiv. 2 &amp; 23. brave and fine, Which sparkle in our Father's House above, Where for His saints the hand of sovereign Love Prepares a place that they may sing and shine. What pearls and gold and garniture Divine Shall meet our wondering gaze where'er we rove; What strains more sweet than of earth's happiest grove For our eternal joyance shall combine. But when the Lord of glory seeks a place Below the sky, what temple rich and rare For His august abode shall man prepare? âGive me a heart,â He says, âsubdued by grace, With faith for gold, and tears for jewels fair, âAnd we will come and make our mansion The same word in the original âJohn xiv. 2 &amp; 23. there.ââ ON THE MORNING STAR. In the dim twilight of a Winter morn, When the dark earth looks up to the grey sky, One radiant Star attracts the wakeful eye, And sheds a lustre o'er the scene forlorn. And chiefly as the time when Christ was born The Light of a dark world, is drawing nigh, You see it hang its sparkling lamp on high, And with its fairest rays the sky adorn. I sit and gaze upon its light so cheering, Till in the glowing dawn it hides its head, And the thought rises that sweet sight endearing; Whatever mortal mists my soul may sadden, âI am the Morning Star,â my Saviour said, Earth's dimness with Heaven's dayspring sent to gladden. THE FIRST VIOLET. Sweet violet, that out of view, Through snow and sleet and shower, Hast kept a speck of heavenly blue To bless this vernal hour. Oh, could we learn thy gentle art When trouble clouds our skies, To cherish in our secret heart A hope that never dies! Sweet violet, that dost enfold In buds thy fragrance rare, Through weary months of rain and cold, To sweeten now the air. Oh, could we emulate thy skill, To nurse, through days of gloom, A patient faith that watches still To burst in odorous bloom! Not always in this wintry world Shall Hope neglected lie, But soon its grace shall be unfurled Beneath a fairer sky. Not always will the breath divine Of Faith forgotten be, But soon a genial day will shine, To set its sweetness free. Then, in serener climes above, Shall Faith and Hope appear, Decking the brow of sovereign Love Through the eternal year. ON THE BAPTISM OF OUR INFANT. Arrayed in white, we give to God our child, While a fair wreath of snowdrops set in moss (As lilies might the Laver's rim emboss) Circles the Font with blossoms undefiled. From Heaven a white-winged angel is beguiled To see his charge signed with the Saviour's Cross, Token that he shall count the world but loss In soldier-service for the Master mild. Oh, may the âwater and the bloodâ this day, Made efficacious by the Spirit's might, Bedeck our darling's soul in fair array; That here a pilgrim he may âwalk in white,â Till, âWell done, faithful one,â the Master say, âWear the bright garland of the finished fight!â MABEL'S HAT. A little maiden's rustic hat I found With hawthorn flowers and oak leaves twined all over, Golden laburnum, bugle, and red clover. What though her temples now with sleep were crowned, As if the slumbrous poppy wreathed them round; In dreams she still appears a woodland rover, And trips along as happy as a lover, Through leafy shade and field and pleasure ground. Thus daily on thy simple life, dear child, May Nature leave her fair and fragrant traces; And daily round thy soul Religion mild Entwine the blossoms of celestial graces; Making thee âholy, harmless, undefiled,â And meet to range in bliss through starry spaces. CRAB-APPLE GATHERERS. When happy rooks were wheeling overhead, A noisy clanâwe spent a bright half-hour, Children and elders, where, in woodland bower, The clustered crabs were gleaming rosy red. 'Mid shouts and laughter, soon the fruit lay spread Upon the dewy grass, smiling but sour; And soon we filled our baskets with the dower Which Nature from her horn of plenty shed. Then home we hied, with spoils of Autumn laden, And from that fruit a golden syrup drew, The joy of elders as of boy and maiden, At many a merry meal the winter through: Thrice happy who Life's bitters bravely meet, And then through grace and patience find them sweet! HARVEST PRAISE. Fairer than Summer rose, A smile of golden glory meets the view; To right and left, by woodland green it glows, And by the ocean blue. Sweeter than Summer bird, We catch the music of a rippling voice; With a melodious undertone 'tis heard To whisper and rejoice. But soon the standing sheaves Lift up their hands to heaven and shout aloud: Like waves at sunset all the landscape heaves With the exulting crowd. And at that pleasant sight, And joyous sound, we smile, and grateful raise Our song for fields unto the harvest white, And the Creator praise. It is the Lord alone Who calls the tender shoot from the rough clod, And crowns the springing blade with ear full-grown, And bids it graceful nod. 'Tis His kind hand that sheds The rain and sunshine on the yellowing corn, Until a glittering host of helmÃ¨d heads Each glorious field adorn. He sends the genial hour For gathering in the kindly fruits of earth: He flings abroad the bounteous autumn dower Of annual harvest mirth. Oh, then, let all men lift Their heart and voice to God with praises meet; But yield their highest thanks for His best gift, The dying âCorn of Wheat!â CHURCH SCULPTURE. A sculptor I beheld with cunning hand From shapeless stone fair leaves and flowers untwine, Crowning the columns of a lofty shrine. Like trees those pillars rise, a noble band, Their tops of diverse foliage deftly plann'd: While oak and maple, sycamore and vine, With shamrock, lily, passion-flower combine, To emulate some sylvan landscape grand. The God of Nature is the God of Grace: Then bring thy leaves, O sculptor, and thy flowers To shed their woodland beauty o'er this place, Fann'd by the breath Divine of holy hours; Until we almost feel we see His face, Whose voice at eve thrilled Eden's leafy bowers! A CRUCIFORM CHURCH. (ROTHERHAM.) Where the far-stretching nave and glorious choir With stately transepts, intersecting, blend, And form a mighty Cross, I see ascend As with a leap to Heaven the tapering spire. It bids me lift my looks and longings higher Than this world's smoke and cloudâto let them tend To yonder azure Home and gracious Friend, And set on things above my heart's desire. Thus, resting on the Cross as on its base, See the fair fabric of Religion rise, Truth her foundation and her topstone Grace: Thus ever upwards see her point men's eyes Which some celestial ladder seem to trace, Its foot on earth, its summit in the skies. WATER TURNED TO WINE. ââWhate'er He saith to you,â Whene'er He lifts an eye or waves a hand, âServants,â be ready to observe and âdoâ His first, His least command.â Such was the whispered word Of Mary, waiting for the Master's âhour,â Ere yet the Godhead in the manhood stirred, To âmanifestâ its power. But lo! the failing wine The rising gladness of the banquet mars; When, âFill with water,â spake the voice Divine, âYon empty water jars.â It seemed a bootless task; But clear the order, though the drift was dim; It was not theirs the meaning strange to ask: âThey filled them to the brim.â Then at His Word they drew From those full jars, what was not any more Water, but fragrant scent and purple hue Of choicest vintage bore. Oh, fruitful is the toil Of patient workers for the Lord of grace: Duty and tears will yield them joyous spoil, Water to wine give place. Our daily task may seem Like pouring water into jars of earth; But wrought for Him, it wins a roseate gleam And a celestial worth. The cup of sorrow pale Taken from hour to hour by trustful loveâ A deepening lustre in it we shall hail, Caught from a Face above. A simple kindness done To some poor sufferer for the Master's sake, Like a grey cloud fired by the setting sun, Shall into glory break. Here for a season placed, As servants we draw water at His will; There as His guests the new wine we shall taste On the Eternal hill! SOLACE IN SICKNESS. Clouded with sickness, Lord, languid with pain, I cannot work or meditate or pray; The night is dreary, and forlorn the day. From Nature or from Grace I seek in vain Some gleam of comfort. Shall I not complain Of precious golden sands, which slip away Out of Time's hour-glass, touched with no sweet ray Of service, or of spiritual gain? âNot so!â a Voice replied. âFor each dark hour Patiently borne, for each sharp pain and ache, An added jewel in thy crown shall shake, And gathered âweightâ accrue to âGlory'sâ dower. Sufferings are gifts; accept them for My sake, And from earth's sighs Heaven's music shall awake.â A SUFFERING CHRISTIAN'S PRAYER. âMy Father, say âGood nightâ unto Thy child!â And let Thy blessing bring me the repose I sorely need, and my tired eyelids close In balmy slumber and oblivion mild. Oh, banish evil dreams and fancies wildâ Sad shadows, it may be, of bygone woes; And give me restâimage of peace which flows Through Jesus from a Father reconciled. âMy Father, say âGood morningâ to Thy child!â And let Thy smile bring comfort for the morrow; Give me a conscience calm and undefiled, A courage strong to cope with pain and sorrow; âThe day is Thine,â O Lord, âthe night is Thine,â And Thou, through grace and promises, art mine! HOME AND HEAVEN. His feet have wandered where loud cataracts foam In pine-clad dells; or, through the distance clear, White Alps and purple Apennines appear, Grey classic tower, and air-suspended dome. O'er earth's famed regions he has loved to roam, By palm and pyramidâafar and near; But nought now seems to him so fair and dear As that old Church which marks his Childhood's Home. Thus when our mortal pilgrimage shall cease, And eye and ear at length are satisfied With sights and sounds of earth; oh, what deep peace Will rise within us, always to abide, As that blest âHouse not made with handsâ we seeâ Our Home and Temple through eternity! WINTER LESSONS. When o'er the naked trees and shuddering air Relentless Winter sways his sceptre cold; Through the rent curtain of the branches bare The tapering spire, sky-pointing, we behold. So, when our drooping lives lose leaf and flower Beneath the weight of stern affliction's rod; That wintry season is the chosen hour When praying hearts look up and see their God. When o'er the withered grass and leaf-strewn ground Falls softly the fair mantle of the snow; Nought but a robe of white is seen around, Concealing all the stains of earth below. So, when our faith, of Heaven-blest sorrow born, Takes hold of Christ, His mantle pure and white Is put upon our souls, and sweetly worn; And all our deep-dyed sins are lost to sight. Summer and Winter, Thou, O Lord, hast made; Sunshine and storm combine to work Thy will; The barren branches and the leafy shade Thy purposes of love alike fulfil. We take our mercies and we give Thee praise For all the comfort of the Summer glow: And through the dimness of our wintry days We learn the God-sent lessons of the snow! A GETHSEMANE MARIGOLD. A bee crept round my sun-like marigold And sucked the nectar from that Eastern bloom, Whose shining ancestry did once illume The sacred olive-gardenâwhere of old Dark clouds of sorrow o'er the Saviour rolled. How strange this honied brightness to that gloom, That awful shadow of the Cross and tomb, That cup of gall and bitterness untold. O Lord of love, blest Oriental Flower, Casting a gleam on this far western isle, Fain would I seek Thy face from hour to hour, To taste Thy sweetness and to feel Thy smile,â My comfort here, and Plant of rare renown, My glory yonder, and my golden crown. ON A CYPRESS FROM MOUNT SINAI, IN SANDOWN VICARAGE GARDEN, ISLE OF WIGHT. A seedling from the rugged mountain heights Of Sinai, where one lonely Cypress tree Sways to the smiting blast, which wanders free Over those rocky solitudes, and blights The scanty verdure. Here Love's hand delights To tend it amid blossoms, where the bee Mingles its music with the whispering sea, And the Church bell to prayer and praise invites. O tapering Cypress, my aspiring soul In thy symbolic story fain would share; Not where the stormy blasts of Sinai roll May I be found; but in a garden fair, Where Calvary's Cross and Sharon's rose are seen Pointing to Paradise and joys serene. ON A DENARIUS OF TIBERIUS CÃSAR, THE SILVER âPENNYâ OF THE GOSPELS. The Roman âpennyâ in my hand to-day, Stamped with the same imperial âimageâ stern And superscription that I here discern, Once in the open palm of Jesus lay. I gazeâand centuries, dream-like, fade away; The years of that mysterious life return; I see the down-turned Face for which saints yearn, Which dimly floats above them when they pray. But lo! the silver in that gracious palm, Even while I ponder, takes a darker hue; That Face is marr'd, though still divinely calm, That outstretched hand, iron has pierced it through; Not silver now, or gold, but Gilead's balm Of âprecious bloodâ meets my adoring view! THE TEMPLE WINDOWS. âCHRIST IN YOU.â âThat Christ may dwell in your heart by faith.â Since in the temple of the Christian's heart Dwells Jesus, surely through the Christian's eyes As through a window, or the thin disguise Of screen or lattice-work, He will impart Tokens of His dear presence; and will dart Some gentle rays to comfort or make wise A weary world that still in darkness lies, Weighed down by doubts and fears and sorrow's smart. Is âChrist in us,ââbe ours the glorious dower To show the Saviour shining in our face, And through our eyes forth-putting His sweet power To help the weak and wayward with His grace; Oh, let not sin in us those windows dim Through which the world might catch some glimpse of Him. âMEET FOR THE MASTER'S USE.â âMeet for the Master's useââ Be this my guiding star, Which, to things earthly sitting loose, I follow from afar. I have a Master great, His right o'er me supreme, Who did in love my soul create, And with His blood redeem. He has a use for meâ A work beneath the sky, To which, unworthy though I be, He calls me from on high. Lord, at Thy piercÃ¨d feet In humble prayer I bow; Oh, make me for Thy service meet, And deign to use me now. Mine eyes are on Thine hands, To take each task from Thee, Till, having lived for Thy commands, I die Thy face to see! THE CURFEW. 'Mid the sweet voices of the vernal year, Charming and transient as the flowers of May, The solemn Curfew wandered on its way, And through a thousand song-birds held mine ear. It seemed to hail me with vibrations clear From far off ages, lost in shadows grey, When England owned the Norman's iron sway, Which thrills this bell with a forgotten fear. So mid the pleasant sounds of earth and time, Which sweetly occupy the fleeting hour, I catch the cadence of a Heavenly chime: Full eighteen centuries have felt its power, As of a bell melodious and sublime, Fraught not with fear but Love's eternal dower. HILDA'S WOOD, Lady Hilda, the pious and illustrious founder of Whitby Abbey, retired to Hackness in the year 679, and erected a nunnery or cell in that remote valley. The building is quite gone, but its founder's memory lingers in the name given to a wooded hill close by, which is called âHilda Wood.â HACKNESS, NEAR SCARBOROUGH. In green Hackness, where holy Hilda prayed And for her gracious Lord âdid what she could,â No stone of any building has withstood The havoc which twelve centuries have made. Her name has left the valleys where she strayed, Low-lying fields, and streamlet's modest flood; But, like the setting sun, has caught yon wood, Which clothes the girdling heights in pleasant shade. Long as the trees with emerald Spring shall bud, Or burn with yellow Autumn, that fair hill Shall brighten with the memory of the good; Her presence vanished, but a glory still Touches the grove and hallows all the place Blest by the footsteps of a life of Grace. ON AN OLD ASH TREE, NEAR THE SITE OF A FORMER VILLAGE AND DESECRATED CHAPEL IN LONDESBOROUGH PARK. O ancient ash-tree, shattered, gnarled, contorted, But living still, what tales thou hast to tell Since in thy shade at call of holy bell, Hither for prayer the villagers resortedâ Where long the deer have ranged, the lambs disported: No cottage smoke now curls from this green dell, No chapel lifts its cross; but by the swell Of falling waters the lone ear is courted. Man's home and name and memory fade away, While still, like hoary Time, this ash survives; But from the Cross has fallen a cheering ray Beyond the limit of these narrow lives; Not all of man decays before a treeâ We passâto our immortal destiny! AUTUMN LEAVES; OR, âTONGUES IN TREES.â In peaceful solitude they flutter down, And strew the sylvan pool and lichened rock; Deck'd in all shades of orange, red, and brown, Which sober green with painted glories mock. Spring-time can boast its wealth of blossoms fair, The Summer umbrage like an emerald glows; But Autumn's mild decay illumes the air With splendours which no other season knows. Oh, may the hope of my declining hour Be seen to brighten with departing breath; And like the leaves in an autumnal bower Take lustre from the gentle touch of Death. Then, like the leaves, I must my part fulfil Through all the passage of Life's fleeting year; In shine or shade, in stormy days or still, At lightsome noontide, or at midnight drear. Those patient leaves have kept their steadfast place, Or only to Ãolian music stirred; Have fanned with cooling shade the traveller's face, Or screened the secret of a brooding bird. And cannot I some helpful influence shed, Some shelter offer, or some shadow throw; Comfort some anxious heart, or aching head, While from my grateful lips sweet praises flow? And as those arching boughs of crimson tint Give to the light a beauty not its own; While through the coloured leaves the sunbeams glint On shining water or on mossy stone; So when my life sinks low on fluttering wing May light surround me from the ensanguined Tree, Through healing leaves a cheering radiance fling And bathe my soul in hues of Calvary! THE BIRD-COMFORTER. Though from his My friend the Rev. G. Braithwaite, of Beechfield, Yealand Conyers, formerly Sub-dean of Chichester, and author of âSonnets and other Poems.â He was a great lover of birds, and could imitate their notes. sealÃ¨d lips, alas, no word, On this side Heaven, will ever soothe her ear, There lives an echo of his accents dear, Mixed with the music of a warbling bird; Which not in vain from day to day had heard, In happy vernal hours, his whistle clear, But caught the cadence, and repeats it here, In notes by which a widowed heart is stirred. Close to the window, in his favourite beech, It sits and sings to her, at morn and eve, And seems, for vanished tones of human speech, Some wingÃ¨d angel's cheering strains to weave, Chanting of bowery rest beyond the reach Of earth's sharp thorns which mortal bosoms grieve. HOPE FOR OLD AGE. SUGGESTED BY THE WORDS OF AN AGED PARISHIONER. What though the hand of time, with deepening furrow, Has graven on my brow full fourscore years, And oft my path has led through toils and tears, Old age is not to me âlabour and sorrow.â This tent of mine is shattered, but I borrow From failing flesh a brightening hope that cheers; And as Life's sinking sun the horizon nears, I hail the approach of Heaven's eternal morrow. Not down, but up, the hill with footsteps slow, I journey; and behold, a glory rises In the grey East, which makes my cheek to glow, And with strange beauty my dim eye surprises; Joy dawns; the veil rends; and I seeâI see The Face of Him who opened Heaven for me! PARADISE. Adam all day 'mid odorous garden bowers Had lightly toiledâwhile many a tender word, With murmur of the brook and song of bird, Fell on Eve's ear at work amongst her flowers; When lo! where grove of pine and cedar towers, As with a gentle breeze the leaves are stirred, And walking in the garden God is heard, With voice of love charming those evening hours. With conscious innocence, and hand in hand That goodly pair approach their awful Friend, Like children with belovÃ¨d father stand; Then at his feet in adoration bend.â O golden age! O days of heaven on earth! When life was piety and labour mirth. SAMSON'S RIDDLE. Through Timnath's vineyards as alone he strayed, Roused from its secret lair, a lion roared; With his bare hands and help from heaven implored, Lifeless the tawny monster soon he laid. Passing once more he sought the same green shade, When lo! a swarm of bees had strangely stored In the bleached skeleton their fragrant hoard, And there a dainty feast for him had made. Thus in our path when threatening danger rises, Let us trust God and it will disappear; His Providence assumes alarming guises To make us fly to Him, unseen, but near; While Love prepares a thousand sweet surprises God's ways to our weak hearts the more to endear. ON A THRUSH SINGING AT A FUNERAL IN NOVEMBER. What means that softly-piped, melodious strain While yet long months of chilling frost and snow Must intervene before the violets blow, And April sunshine cheers us after rain? Of hope it whispers to that mournful train Which treads the churchyard path with footsteps slowâ Of heavenly hope assuring earthly woe That songs and blooms and rapture yet remain. Ah, who can tell what bower of Paradise May shelter now that dear departed one Whose praises, like sweet music, softly rise? And when the days of waiting all are done What blissful scenes shall fill our ravished eyes While wreathed in flowers the Eternal year shall run! A THOUGHT IN A MARCH ROOKERY. With loud content the rook industrious weaves The fabric of her nest, while March winds blow, And rock the uneasy cradle to and fro, Curtained by no warm canopy of leaves. Fostering her callow young ones, she receives With patient wing the pelting rain and snow: And while her daily food lies spread below, For future wants and woes she never grieves. So let us pass through Life's tumultuous hour With a light heart and ride upon the breeze, Trusting our all to that benignant Power, Who with a Father's loving eye foresees Whatever fears may rise or storms may lower, Controlling all things with Almighty ease! PASSING AWAY. What is the whisper of the dying year? âPassing away,â it sighs, âPassing away:â Nothing below continues in one stay; All earthly glories fade and disappear. The haunts to childhood and to memory dearâ The cherished walls where once we knelt to pray, Our very churches crumble and decay: The touch of Time corrodeth all things here. But 'mid the general wreck two things endure; Nor change shall reach them, nor decay shall wrong; The steadfast stars may fall; God's Word I. Peter, i. 25. stands sure; And whoso does God's will, I. John, ii. 17. he shall prolong His life for ever in those mansions pure, Where men shall be as angels bright and strong. THE PILLAR. âHim that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God.â Rev. iii. 12. Shall I a pillar be Within Thy Courts above, Steadfast and beautiful to see, And crowned with wreaths of love? I am a poor weak reed, Shaken with every gust; Thy kind supporting hand I need To lift me from the dust. Yet, Lord, Thou wilt not break A reed that bruisÃ¨d lies, But gently raise it up to make A pillar in the skies. Erect it there shall stand, Founded upon a Rock; One column of a beauteous band That fear no tempest-shock. 'Tis theirs to rest and shine; 'Tis theirs to work and bear The burden of the House divine, The Heavenly Temple fair. Round them what glories blaze, What songs harmonious roll, As myriad tongues uplift the praise Which stirs each ransomed soul. And mid those pillars bright The Lord Himself is seen Walkingâthe Temple's living Light, The Morning Star serene. O for Almighty Grace, For overcoming love, To win for me a pillar's place In God's great House above! THE ROMAN CAMP. AT CAWTHORNE, NEAR PICKERING. We rested on a green escarpment high, Where heather in luxuriant beauty crowned A Roman Campâits deep-trenched foss and mound Left sixteen centuries since beneath the sky. From this steep hill the conqueror's eagle eye Swept the horizonâhourly glanced around The subject dales, the while he paced the ground With armÃ¨d steps where carelessly we lie. He holds possession in a foreign soil And needsâto keep his restless foe at bayâ A vigilant outlook and unceasing toil: Thus Grace, in sinful hearts, through life's short day Must watch and work the native powers to foil, And her deep prints no time will wear away. ON THE SIGHT OF A SEA-BIRD IN APRIL. Wandering alone in pensive mood, I saw A Sea-bird wing its solitary way; The sunbeams glistened on its fair array Of plumage, white as foam, without a flaw. I felt an admiration mixed with awe, Knowing where'er that gentle bird might stray, Beneath the shield of England's care it lay, Protected by the majesty of Law. And from its wings there glanced a cheering thought, For a lone child by a wise God designed: âThou art a creature of a nobler kind, Thy peace and welfare Heaven itself has sought; A mightier shield defends thee from above, Safe by the law of Everlasting love.â A WHITE CHRISTMAS. A SONNET FOR CHILDREN. Dear English children, fresh from happy dreams, With Christmas carols blended, what a world Of sudden snow before you is unfurled; How like a dream the altered outlook seems. Peaceful it shines beneath the morning beams, And every spray with beauty is impearled; But wildly through the night the storm has whirled, And sadly on some eyes the cold snow gleams. While you slept sweetly in the curtained room, And blithely woke to welcome Christmas morn; Children ill-fed, ill-clad, through hours of gloom Have sighed, to shudder in the light forlorn. You darlingsâtry to soften their sad doom For His dear love Who this white day was born! A LITTLE GIRL AT THE SEASIDE. Her first evening by the sea, Oh, how glad she feels and free; What a freshness in the airâ Joy and beauty everywhere! How the dancing water glows, Bridged with gold or streaked with rose; Golden towards the glorious West, Roseate where the cloud-tints rest. Cliffs and crags, how grand and high, Tower above her to the sky; And how tempting the bright shore For young feet to wander o'er. She could fancy she had wings As from rock to rock she springs; She will run and climb all night In a dreamland of delight. Ah! dear girl, to such as thee Life is but a smiling sea, O'er whose waves Hope gaily throws Lines of gold or tints of rose. Life is but a happy strand Bordered with imaginings grand; And all eager thou to climb Up the dangerous rocks of Time. May the angel-hand of Grace Help thee o'er each slippery place, Guide thee on thine upward way, Year by year and day by day; And across Life's changeful sea May it show that Bridge to thee, Skyward built by One of old Not with silver or with gold! THE RAINBOW, A SYMBOL. When eyes that watched the Flood rise and decline First saw the Bow of beauteous colours braided Which spann'd a threatening cloud, then slowly faded, Each heart relied on that assuring Sign. So when in Christ the dazzling Light Divine Spreads out its heavenly splendours, softly-shaded In cloud of flesh, our trembling faith is aided On God's sure truth and mercy to recline. To see Him once to holy John was given, âClothed in a cloud, a rainbow round His head,â Earth's fair memorial wearing still in heaven; And when God looks upon that blessed token Encircling âHim who liveth, and was dead,â He keeps His covenant of peace unbroken. TAKE UP AND READ. âTolle, lege; tolle, lege.â âSt. Augustine's Confess., viii. 12. When light and darkness in his soul contended, And sighs and tears forced their impetuous way, As prostrate 'neath a fig-tree's shade he lay, A voice melodious on his ear descended. It seemed the tongue of men and angels blended; Commissioned, with repeated strain, to say, âTake up and read,â and soon will shine Truth's day, âTake up and read,â soon will Sin's night be ended. Instant he rose, and seized the sacred scroll: He reads the words which meet his eager eye, Rom. xiii. 13, 14. And God's own finger stamps them on his soul; Absolving peace pervades him from on high, The chains of his besetting sin unroll, And leave him clothed with light and liberty. WINTER WHEAT. As by some leafless hedge or rustic stile Betwixt bare fields I wander, lo, the scene Suddenly flushes with an emerald sheen, Caught from the Winter wheat; a cheery smile Permitted this dark season to beguile With hope of radiant autumn-hours serene: As if December wreathed his brow with green, And whispered through his snows, âA little while.â So in Earth's dreariest Winter-time was seen The new-born lustre of our âCorn of wheat;â An Infant smile, oh, how divinely sweet; Blessing the fields those favoured hills between: And that fair gleam still speaks to Faith's dim eyes Of Harvest-treasure in the peaceful skies. WINTER BLOSSOMS. See how blue violets and the pale primrose Round sleeping Winter's brow securely cluster, Lending the dreary woods unwonted lustre Where his recumbent form he idly throws, While at his feet a shining rivulet flows; But soon the Giant will awake and bluster Among the creaking trees, and frowning, muster His icy winds and clouds and muffling snows. Then with his chilling fingers he will scatter The untimely wreath that graced his tangled hair, Though now the flowers may smile, the sunshine flatter: Let sanguine Hope give heed to sober Reasonâ Of buds that burst precociously bewareâ To everything on earth there is a season. FROM MY STUDY WINDOW. (MILFORD HALL, KIRKBY WHARFE, 1863â1866.) From my Study-window, Down a vista green, In the hazy distance, A grey Church-tower is seen;â Across my quiet garden, Between the elm-trees high, Its dark, shadowy outline Stands forth against the sky;â Across my bowery orchard Upon the horizon blue, O'er field and lane and woodland, It terminates the view. From my Study-window, As from Prophet's bower, Daily I sit gazing On that old Church-tower; While the trains incessant, In the distance seen, Passing and repassing Cross that vista green; And their white smoke curling Hides the Church-tower grey Only for a moment, Then vanishes away. That thin fleeting vapour Daily I behold Blotting out the Church-tower Long centuries old: Like a veil it rises, Hanging in the air, The tower is lost an instant, Then again is there: Thus in that green vista, All the livelong day, Pass the trains incessant, Stands the Church-tower grey. And manifold reflections Strike upon my mind:â In that fleeting vapour Man's brief Life I findâ We are here a moment, Then no more are seen, Quickly disappearing As if we ne'er had been; Like that white smoke curling In the distance blue, Floating there an instant, Then vanishing from view. But that Church-tower ancient, Standing as of yore, Steadfast through past ages, Strong for ages more, Seems of Time a symbol Gazing on the strife, The noise and stir unceasing, And restlessness of life: Above the smoke and discord Rises that tranquil tower, As Time looks down serenely On Life's brief feverish hour. Again, as that white vapour Conceals the Church-tower greyâ Hangs like a veil before it, Then quickly rolls away; So cloudy mists of Error The face of Truth may veil, And triumph for a moment, But Truth can never fail: The smoke of human systems Will vanish into air, But Truth shall stand for ever, Immutable and fair. At times that distant Church-tower Seen clear against the sky Appears to me to beckon My lingering soul on high; It bids me not to loiter In Life's dim avenue, But seek that far off glory Beyond the horizon blueâ Where past Earth's mists and changes The Heavenly Temple stands, Jerusalem the golden, The House not made with hands. Thus from my Study-window I gaze with thoughtful eyes, And gather sacred emblems And calmly moralize; While on the blue horizon, Far down the vista green, That venerable Church-tower Against the sky is seen; And frequent trains resounding Across the vista glide, And with their curling vapour The tower a moment hide. SWEET EGLANTINE. In giving this set of Rondeaux the author thinks it may interest the general reader to know that the Rondeau is an old French form of verse, recently introduced into English literature, and consists of thirteen lines, with only two rhymes, and a refrain composed of the first four words of the poem, which is generally unrhymed. Sweet Eglantine, whose fragrance rare Like incense loads the evening air, How closely do thy arms entwine This forest oak, and like the vine, Enrich the boughs thy weight that bear. Such lowly daring I would share, And hang upon the Strong my care; And imitate thy instinct fine, Sweet Eglantine. And there is One who loves to wear Whatever flowers of praise and prayer Crown this dependent life of mine; And so I grasp His strength Divine, Clinging like thee, as on I fare, Sweet Eglantine. IN TWILIGHT DIM. In twilight dim upon a spray Chanteth a thrush at close of day: A chilly mist pervades the air, And all things seem of comfort bare, But Mavis has a secret gay. What gives such joyance to his lay, And cheers him with an unseen ray, Making the sombre woodland fair, In twilight dim? Something the opening leaves must say, Which lends a glow to evening grey: Perhaps they whisper, âHave no care, Spring's steps are echoing everywhere.â Have we no leaves our souls to stay, In twilight dim? IN SUNSHINE SWEET. In sunshine sweet the happy bee, From Winter's weary durance free, Hums as it sips the nectar fine From golden cups of celandine, And fills the air with vernal glee. And yet a sadness creeps o'er me, Born of that slender minstrelsy, A shadow of regret is mine In sunshine sweet. The bee may roam o'er wood and lea, And murmur blithe round flower and tree, But with its music I entwine Pathetic thoughts of auld lang syneâ Dear faces I no more shall see In sunshine sweet. DOROTHEA. (Baptized April 15, 1878.) As birds in Spring by fresh green leaves Are welcomed, where the woodland weaves A bower for sea-tired wings to rest; So careful Love with open breast Thee, birdie sweet, to earth receives. Nought here our tender nursling grieves; No tossing wave of trouble heaves, Where thou hast found a happy nest, As birds in Spring. Dear joy in thee our heart achieves, Sweet Dorothea, and believes And names thee God's gift, latest, best; Heaven-sent to bless us, and be blest, And sing beneath our sheltering eaves, As birds in Spring. BLUE HYACINTHS. Blue hyacinths with drooping bell, What happy secret do ye tell To all the listening flowers around, Which star-like deck the verdant ground, In sheltered lane and wooded dell? What merry notes around you swell, As if the song-birds loved you well, And made the echoing groves resoundâ Blue hyacinths. Your fragrant beauty can dispel Heart-sorrow for awhile, and quell The thorny griefs which here abound; For where your glowing hues are found On earth there falls a heavenly spell, Blue hyacinths. FROM DESCRIPTION OF HUMAN LIFE. Happy the man who welcoming each day With smiles that answer to its fleeting ray, Pursues with steps serene his purposed way. The alluring snares peculiar to the age His soul enslave not, nor his mind engage; His life with peaceful tenor glides along, By fav'ring breezes fann'd and soothed with song; Inspir'd by Heaven with soul-sustaining force, Seldom he falls or falters in his course; But ever as the eddying years roll round, Bursting through all the perils that abound, A wise asserter of himself is found. JESUS CHRIST'S EXPOSTULATION WITH AN UNGRATEFUL WORLD. I am all fair, yet no one loveth Me; Noble, yet no one would My servant be; Rich, yet no suppliant at My gate appears; Almighty, yet before Me no one fears; Eternal, I by very few am sought; Wise am I, yet My counsel goes for nought; I am the Way, yet by Me walks scarce one; The Truth, why am I not relied upon? The Life, yet seldom one My help requires; The True Light, yet to see Me none desires; And I am merciful, yet none is known To place his confidence in Me alone. Man, if thou perish, 'tis that thou dost choose it; Salvation I have wrought for thee, O use it! To My Book. Go tell thy tale to any ear Which loves the notes resounding clear Through sylvan aisle or winding dale; Where lilies meet the nightingale To bless with scent and song the year. To any heart that holds more dear The sacred thoughts of saint or seer, Embalmed in leaves which never fail, Go tell thy tale. Where souls are sad and homes are drear, Like flowers or singing-birds appear; Breathe comfort to the mourner pale; Say to the lowly-wise, All hail; Thy words are heart-deep; do not fear,â Go tell thy tale.</field>
