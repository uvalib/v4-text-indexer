      <field name="fulltext">DIRGE FOR AOINE AND OTHER POEMS DIRGE FOR AOINE (A Fairy) White and golden here she lies; Mouth-of-Rose was she. Violets hide her sleeping eyes; Leaves of rosemary Keep her from the rainy skies, Winter's cold or spring's surprise, Brawling summer bee. White and golden flowers we bring, Gipsy-rose and broom: Spider shall not snare her wing, Yellow wasp not dare to sting What we cover, while we sing, Under drifts of bloom; But bees bring her, murmuring, Honey and perfume. Oh my grief! her yellow hair Tempts no wind to-day. Folded round her forehead fair All her tresses stay, Stealing from the summer air Half its gold away. Suddenly the woods are bare— Beechwoods that so shining were In the moon of May. She will never rise again, Woman o' the Shee. In the moonlight fair and fain She will never be. Poppies red and bearded grain, Bending, bowing in the rain, Sunrise-gold and sunset-stain She will never see. For her ears all songs are vain, Tossed from tree to tree. 'Tis my grief that we must go (Thus our doom is said) Dancing lightly as the snow, Or as autumn leaves that blow Lightly, lightly to and fro, With no tears to shed, Though we loved her yellow head, Though her yellow head is low Where the tattered ragweeds grow, Though the very squirrels know Aoine's dead. DIRGE FOR PRINCE ART (Desired by the Fairies, and being Cold to Them, Slain by an Elf-bolt) White of skin and brown of hair, Here he lies who has done with care. Goibnu's feast called long for him; Manan's guests made a song for him. He who eats at Goibnu's feast, May not be hurt by man or beast; He who listens to Manan's song, Hears no other his whole life long. Manan's guests, and Goibnu's kin, All in vain they called him in. Naught he heeded the merrows' call, Though soft they sang to him one and all. Naught he heeded of charm or spell, Holy thorn-tree or haunted well, Naught he heeded of sowlth or shee, Or fruit that grew on the quicken-tree. Wandering signs in the sky he knew, Magic of moonlight, rain and dew: Turned his steps not for foul or fair, Long though they for his soul set snare. Neither has won him. Here he lies Sleeping under the wakeful skies. The stars behold him, the wind has ears— Ah! but he neither sees nor hears. Call to him, cry to him, wind and rain, Breath of the clover, o'er him again Pass and tarry, if he should wake; Earth, be moved for his sleeping sake. Here's the beauty we thought to win, And the light is quenched that shone bright within Here's the body we loved and slew: Art, but where is the soul of you? Cover softly the quiet face; Leaves are thick in his sleeping-place. The soul of him goes far and free, And the body's left to the Lianan-sidhe. Empty hands we have folded close Over buds of the gipsy-rose: Over his breast and the arrow there We have laid a mantle of maiden-hair. We that watched at his head and feet, Yield our watch to the meadowsweet. We that loved him and could not win Breathing body or soul within— We, immortal, who cannot weep, Give our grief to the winds to keep. Here we have all we knew of fair— White of skin and brown of hair, Ululu! THE ROWING-SONG OF KING ATLI Row, row, through the darkling sea— One king's daughter is waiting me: Her hair is unbound till I come to land, And gather her hair in my conqueror's hand, And set my crown on her shining head And bear her, crowned, to our wedding-bed. Row, row, under skies of gray— Two kings' sisters I carried away. They sleep in my byre and they milk my kine, And the dreams they dream are servants of mine. Row, row, through the threshing waves— Red cocks crow over three kings' graves. Their wives at my will they saw and knew; Then my mercy spoke and my henchmen slew. Row, row, while the oar-blades hold— Four kings' children I bought and sold: Two that had sucked at the same kind breast I sundered as far as East from West. One that had cursed me I clothed in gold, And into the hand of a sultan sold; One that had silently ta'en my yoke I gave for a slave to my fisher-folk. Row, row, through the sea-fires' flare— Five kings' women gave me their hair; Soft was the flaxen and long the brown, Worthy the black hair to bear a crown, But Gudrun's gold hair shines them all down. Row, row, while the wind holds fair, Six kings' brothers my banner bear: On a golden field black swoops the raven With fear on its wings from haven to haven. Row, row, while the shore-winds blow! Seven queens with my herd-girls go: Fierce and shy are my cattle all, Far must my herds go, long must they call. Row, row, lest the good winds fail! Eight queens shall pour me my wedding-ale, Light the torches and smoothly spread The covers of sendal sewn with red. Row, row, for the shore is nigh; Nine kings I've made; and the tenth am I, And I am little and swart to see, And white is the woman that waits for me. Atli the Hun, I come a-land With the strength of ten kings in my hand; And she that I seek is deadly fair With the beauty of ten in her eyes and hair. AUGUST Red blossoms to the rosy earth I bring: The sharp-thorned briar for me is all aflush. I set red holly-hocks a-blossoming Rosier than ever hawthorn flowered in spring, And every bush of mine's a burning bush. 'Mid sworded leaves the gladioli push Scarlet and crimson; damask roses fling Red leaves upon my pathway. Musicking Before my pageant goes the enamoured thrush; There is no pause of beauty, of song no hush. Red admirals fly about me, light of wing, And love-lies-bleeding for my garland grows With spicy southernwood and gipsy-rose. BEAUTY Beauty was born of the world's desire For the wandering water, the wandering fire. Under the arch of her hurrying feet, She has trodden a world full of bittersweet. The blood of the violet is in her veins; Her pulse has the passion of April rains. Out of the heart of a satin flower God made her eyelids in one sweet hour. Out of the wind He made her feet That they might be lovely, and luring, and fleet. Out of a cloud He wove her hair Heavy and black with the rain held there. What is her name? There's none that knows— Mother-o'-mischief, or Mouth-o'-rose. What is her pathway? None may tell, But it climbs to heaven and it dips to hell. The garment on her is mist and fire, Anger and sorrow and heart's desire. Her forehead-jewel 's an amethyst; The garland to her is love-in-a-mist. Her girdle is of the beryl-stone, And one dark rose for her flower has grown, Filled to the brim with the strength o' the sun, A passionate rose, and only one. The bird in her breast sings all day long A wonderful, wistful, whispering song, The song that is of all passing things: None knows it—wingless or born with wings. THE BLACKBIRD The blackbird has a mouth of gold, though sombre be his feathers; The lark is for the summer noon, the blackbird for all weathers. The lark he sets his heart above all things that are on earth, But the blackbird in the cherry-tree finds rest and food and mirth. The blackbird is a bonny bird despite his mourning colour; He sings but all the merrier when earth and skies grow duller. He whistles and he sings the while he swings from tree to tree, For a rare mate and a fair mate in the cherry-boughs has he. Of all the trees in the orchard the cherry tree's the best, For deep amid its branches, like a blithe heart in its breast, There lilts a hidden blackbird and he's singing to his dear, And who would grudge their cherries so sweet a song to hear? Oh, who would grudge their whitehearts to pay for such a song? God love the merry blackbird who lifts the year along: God shield the blackbird's nestlings and the blackbird's brooding wife, And fill with sweets full measure the days of the blackbird's life. BRIGIT OF THE JUDGMENTS I am Brigit—Wisdom, Light: yea, I am Bride. I loosen all the knots that wrong has tied; I knot all threads that should be woven in one. I am the giver of laws; all evil done Is on my heart until I may unravel Its web with heavy tears and bitter travail. My hair is coloured like the heather honey; My brows are cloudy and my eyes are sunny. Judgment I hold in one hand, in the other Pity; I am both maiden and a mother. I am the judgment-giver; but I give Compassion to all burdened things that live, Struggle, and prey, and so are preyed upon. Because the work-girl's hollow cheeks are wan, Mine are so pale. Because the red ant dies Under a careless foot my deathless eyes Are dark with dool. Because the red fox went Snarling to death, the lilies have no scent That are amid my breast-knots tied, to show I am the mother of all that fade and grow. One man may call me Wisdom who has heard Some darkling midnight stabbed through with my word. One man will call me Light who, ere he dies, Grasps at my hand and looks me in the eyes. I am no Lianan-sidhe; I will not follow The soul that seeks me even in the hollow Lands where the moon is not or any sun, No travail ended and no quest begun. I slay the man who called me Law and strove To slay me, but one name of mine is Love. A CONNAUGHT LOVER'S LAMENT (TO CAROLINE AUGUSTA HOPPER) I will arise and go hence to the west, And dig me a grave where the hill-winds call; But O were I dead, were I dust, the fall Of my own love's footstep would break my rest! My heart in my bosom is black as a sloe! I heed not cuckoo, or wren, or swallow: Like a flying leaf in the sky's blue hollow The heart in my breast is that's mad with woe. Because of the words your lips have spoken (O dear black head that I must not follow) My heart is a grave that is stripped and hollow, As ice on the water my heart is broken. O lips forgetful and kindness fickle, The swallow goes south with you: I go west Where fields are empty and scythes at rest. I am the poppy and you the sickle; My heart is broken within my breast. THE CONNAUGHTMAN RETURNING There's a grey fog over Dublin of the curses, It blinds my eyes, mavrone, and stops my breath; And I travel slow that once could run the swiftest, And I fear ere I meet Mauryeen I'll meet Death. There's a grey fog over Dublin of the curses, And a grey fog dogs my footsteps as they go, And it's long and sore to tread, the road to Connaught. Is it fault of brogues or feet I fare so slow? There's a grey fog over Dublin of the curses, But the Connaught wind will blow it from my way, And a Connaught girl will kiss it from my memory, If the Death that walks beside me will delay. (There's a grey fog over Dublin of the curses, And no wind comes to break its stillness deep; And a Connaughtman lies on the road to Connaught, And Mauryeen will not kiss him from his sleep—Ululu!) THE CUCKOO SINGS IN THE HEART OF WINTER The cuckoo sings in the heart of winter, And all for Mauryeen he tunes his song; How Mauryeen's hair is the honey's colour (He sings of her all the winter long!). Her long loose hair 's of the honey 's colour, The wild sweet honey that wild bees make; The sun herself is ashamed before her The moon is pale for her gold cool's sake. She bound her hair of the honey's colour, With flowers of yarrow and quicken green, And now one binds it with leaves of willow, And cypress lies where my head has been. Now robins sing beside Pastheen's doorway, And wrens for bounty that Grania gave: The cuckoo sings in the heart of winter; He sings all day beside Mauryeen's grave. DALUA If I 'm the faery fool, Dalua— Ay me, the faery fool!— How do I know what the rushes say, Sighing and shivering night and day Over their shadowy pool? How do I know what the North wind cries, Counting his beads of snow: The menace that lies in the Hunter's eyes How do I know? If I 'm the faery fool, Dalua— Ay me, the faery fool!— I cry to those that sent me here, To laugh and jest, to geck and fleer, To scorn at law and rule, “Why did ye also give to me Beauty and peace to know? The ears to hear and the eyes to see And the hands that let all go?” I cry to them that bade me jest “Why made ye me so slight, Yet put a heart within my breast, An evil gift, an evil guest, To spoil me for delight? Made for mere laughter, answer why Must I have eyes for dool? Take from me tears, or let me die, For I am sick of wisdom, I Dalua, the faery fool!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A DEAD GIRL TO HER LOVER AND OTHER POEMS A DEAD GIRL TO HER LOVER I hear the hill-winds. I hear them calling The long gray twilights and white morns through. The tides are rising, the tides are falling, And how will I answer or come to you? For over my head the waves are brawling, And I shall never come back to you! Dark water's flowing my dark head over, And where's the charm that shall bid it back? Wild merrows sing, and strange fishes hover Above my bed o' the pale sea-wrack, And Achill sands have not kept for my lover The fading print of my footsteps' track. Under the sea all my nights are lonely, Wanting a song that I used to hear. I dream and I wake and I listen only For the sound of your footfall kind and dear. Avourneen deelish, your Moirin's lonely, And is the day of our meeting near? The hill-winds coming, the hill-winds going, I send my voice on their wings to you,— To you, mo bouchal, whose boat is blowing Out where the green sea meets the blue. Come down to me now, for there 's no knowing But the bed I lie in might yet hold two! THE DEAD LOVERS (All Souls' Eve, November 1) O good it is to see old love relighted in your eyes, As we meet down by the river beneath October skies! O good it is to touch your hand and know that you forget The grave-dust that has clogged my feet, Margaret! I had not known you, too, were dead, my sweet, until to-day; I wondered that no footstep came to strike fire through my clay; But glad I am to know that Time the Spoiler never set Mark on the flower of your face, Margaret. Did you think long as I thought long before our hands might meet, And are you glad as I am glad that here our wandering feet Are stayed that might have strayed so far afield, and never met On any kind November Eve, Margaret? And are you glad as I am glad that we have died so young, Before the May dew off my feet, the honey off your tongue Had died and dried? And are you glad there is no period set To this, our loving after death, Margaret? And are you glad the wan water rose to your lips, and sealed You to be always fresh and fair as any flower in field? And are you glad the fever lit a fire no wind could fret And burned my body unto death, Margaret? It is my soul that holds your soul, and not my hand of clay That holds your hand, and from your hair wrings the cold dew away, That feels old love alive again and knoweth no regret But blesses Death we died so young, Margaret. THE DEAD WIFE Can you not hear me knocking at midnight on your door? Can you not see my shadow cast on your moonlit floor? To fair and mass and pattern with you I come and go; I scarcely leave you in your dreams and yet you never know. The blind old dog I used to stroke has keener ears to hear; He whines with wistful pleasure to hear my footfall near. Woman or ghost, all 's one to him: his faith knows naught of change, And if you saw and heard me, Dear, would you not find me strange? Could you look deep into my eyes and feel no whit afraid Of wisdom that must come with death to any man or maid? My grief, I think my eyes would blind the gazing soul of you, And you would never find again the colleen that you knew. Call me no more from out my place; you see not when I come. More faithful to my memory is the poor dog that's dumb. Sleep soundly, Ulick, every night: wake gladly every day Because between your soul and mine the links are snapt away. And you shall find a wife more kind, and she shall love you long, But at your passing, Ulick, when I can do no wrong To any timid hope of hers, you'll turn your eyes to me To guide you to the Quiet Place beyond the utmost sea. THE DECADENT Dulness, less comely than grief, has gone over my soul. Sullen and sluggish its waters of bitterness roll; It is naught to me now How the wind-stricken woods to the lash of the nor'-wester bow, How the bubbles are bright on the vanishing track of the vole, How beauty is writ on the world, as a legend is writ on a scroll. It is naught to me, drunken of dulness, an alien here, How the peoples are trodden of anger and sorrow and fear; How lust on the shoulder of love has laid tremulous hand. I am dull, I am slack; And doubt goes before me, and following fast on my track, A ghost I can hear stepping soft o'er the leaf-sodden land. I am old, I am cold. I have trafficked for dreams in the markets where visions are sold! I have bought me a dream, and the dream of my spirit takes toll, And of dreams I am sick. In the place of dead dreams, dead desires, I alone stand up quick— Dulness, less comely than grief, has encompassed my soul. DESIRÉE She had as many loves as she had follies, And all her light loves lightly sang her praises; But now, laid low beneath sharp-leaved sea-hollies And pale sea-daisies, Here at the limit of the hollow shore, Folly and praise are covered meetly o'er. We will not tell her beads of beauty over: All that we say, and all we leave unsaid Be buried with her. There 's no lightest lover But scatters on her bed Pansies for thoughts, and woodruff white as she, And, for remembrance, quiet rosemary. Here is the end of laughter: quenched together Are grief and mirth. Here, dancing feet fall still, Here, where wild thyme and sea-pinks brave wild weather And die at the wind's will. Bring her no dreams here to her quiet home Thou Sea, her sister! bring her weeds and foam. THE DYING SWEETHEART Where are you going, O muirnean, muirnean? Beyond all snowing, Beyond all reach Of tenderest speech, Or waves that break Upon any beach, Or wind's rough blowing On linn or lake— It's there is going Your muirnean O. Where are you going, O muirnean, muirnean? Love is not knowing Why you fell weary, Why you found dreary The way all feet in the world are going. Stay with us, dearie— Ah, muirnean, O! I must be going; Though you stand nearest Of all, and dearest, You cannot keep me, for I must go. Though my heart's breaking That I 'm forsaking The faces kent and the ways I know, I 'll not be staying, For all your praying, For all the gifts in kind Love's bestowing. I must not stay though you hold me so— Ah no, no, no! My bird 's the raven; The doves no more Will I be heeding, Will I be feeding Here at my door, Crooning together, As once of old. My bed 's the heather, My bed is green, And it is not cold. To the quiet haven My boat is going, Where no wind 's blowing Or storm has been. The Ninth Wave 's creeping About my feet; Let me go, Sweet— I'm to my sleeping, And fain to go. O muirnean, muirnean, My muirnean, O! EASTER I am the dream of April, I am the soul of May; The sallows scatter, the sallows splatter their gold upon my way: The gorses swing censers of spring to honour Easter Day. I am the baby April, the woman May will be: I set the berry and hang the cherry on briar and cornel-tree; Mine 's the shut rose, the apple-blows, the rainbow on the sea. My tears are all of April, my laughter is of May, My sorrow's all a cowslip-ball, so light to toss away: My heart is bright with Easter light, my face is fair to see. Because God's risen, and out of prison the whole round world goes free. THE FAIRY FIDDLER (To Caroline Augusta Hopper) 'Tis I go fiddling, fiddling, By weedy ways forlorn; I make the blackbird's music Ere in his breast 'tis born: The sleeping larks I waken 'Twixt the midnight and the morn. No man alive has seen me, But women hear me play Sometimes at door or window, Fiddling the souls away,— The child's soul and the colleen's Out of the covering clay. None of my fairy kinsmen Makes music with me now: Alone the raths I wander Or ride the whitethorn bough, But the wild swans they know me And the horse that draws the plough. FEBRUARY I purify With my clear rain the sombre sky; I wake the snowdrops from their sleep In the earth's bosom brown and deep. I am the stained world's lavender. Because of me The birds make love from tree to tree: I whisper to the daffodil Her hidden cup with gold to fill Since March is on his way to her. I bid the drooping boughs and bare A crown of almond blossoms wear. I call to Earth, Asleep beside her fireless hearth, To rise and come into the air, And shake the snow from feet and hair, What time the new lives in her stir And sap runs sweet in larch and fir. SONG OF THE FOMOROH Who dare set bounds to the Red Wind, The East Wind in his wrath? Lo! we have bitted and bridled him, And turned him from his path! From the waves that beat we have called his feet To the long grass of the rath. He hath heard our call through his tempest fall, And he maketh no delay, Though the house of the Dawn's his homestead Yet there he will not stay; And the voice that compels his coming Is neither of night nor day. The voice blows out of the twilight As thistle-drift is blown. It's light and tender and merry And the seeds that it hath sown Are sin and desire and sorrow; And the world hears, and moves on. From his wings we've taen the scarlet stain, The red plumes from his crest; We've snatched from his hands the sea-pinks Wherewith his cliffs were drest. We have fed our fire to heart's desire With the bird that beat in his breast. Ay, we have bridled the red East Wind With none to say him nay. With his heart's blood red our fires we fed That the sword might be swift to slay, And the ashes at last to his own wind cast That they might be blown away. For we are the dark Fomoroh, And sore we travail that ye May cast off care and grow strong and fair And still our bondsmen be. We shall enter in your souls, our kin, And who shall our slaying see? THE GATE-KEEPER Rough gown, stuff gown, my love hath noble raiment, Silk robes and scarlet robes, pearls of great price: If a man kiss her gown, death is his payment— “Nay: but I keep the gates of Paradise.” Chained hand, stained hand, my love has fingers whiter Than any lily that rocks upon the lake: If a man kiss her hand death falls the lighter— “She sends thee sleeping fast? I bid thee wake.” Bare head, fair head, my love's head on her pillow Black as a bird's wing lies, circled with gold: If a man touch it, he swings from a willow— “Doth her love burn thee so? My breast is cold.” Torn wings, shorn wings, my love goeth wingless: She is wind and water, fire that upward springs. Ere I died praising her I left my harp all stringless. “From my stripped pinions my children make them wings.” Grave eyes, brave eyes, wert thou fain to bear them? Once my love in childbed lay, and cried for pain. I, too, bore dreams with tears, and the four winds tare them. “My children are thy dreams warm with life again.” End me or mend me: heavy is my burden! Years ago we died, and I claim her sins for mine. So she walks heaven's paths hell shall be my guerdon— “I who ope the gate to thee was once that love of thine.” A GEISHA SONG At the sign of the Beckoning Kitten We geishas dwell; Over our doorway is written “Hail and farewell.” Broad is our gateway and litten, Full of sounds as a shell and bright as a star, That all men passing and pausing may surely tell Here lightness and laughter are. Than the foam of the sea we are lighter; No souls have we To lose, or to wane, or grow brighter (Thus say the women that hear us, the men that see). We laugh, though our way be wending, Plain to all sight, Deathwards—away from delight; We laugh, though our world be ending This very night. We dance on the edge of sorrow; We make our song Of yesterday's roses tied with a knotted thong, Of joy that shall end to-morrow. Joy lasts not long, But grief is enduring, and wrong, That man from his evil may borrow Strength, and be strong. We are harps by strange fingers smitten, Broken, and soon cast by; Cups emptied of wine, and dry. We are lamps in the doorway litten And the dawn draws nigh. Soon is our story written Who dance—and die— At the sign of the Beckoning Kitten: Hail and good-bye. GIPSY SONG You are the safe and firelit room, I am the open wold. You are the city, and this your doom— Never to feel the outer cold, Never to fear the inner dark, Never to strain the ears and hark For any foot but the foot of Time, Never to know a loss worth gain Or soul that's worth the birthing-pain, Never to find hill worth the climb Or joy that may be worth the tear— My Dear! You are shut in from snow and sleet, I am out in the wind. My feet are strange to the trodden street As you are strange to the winds that beat, The mists that hover and blind. I cannot stay, you cannot bind: My hands unclasp and let you go, As if you were no more than snow That slips away from me in rain. I love you, yet our souls are twain, For I am knowledge, you are fear, My Dear. GOLD-HEART “Gold of butterflies, gold of bees, Gold of ragweeds and golden seas; Gold on gorses for kissing's sake, Which of these will you touch and take, Moirín, Moirín?” “Golden butterfly's not for me, I'll ha' none o' the golden bee: My heart of gold shall not beat or break, Though I love the gorses for kissing's sake, Mother, Mother!” “Then rest you merry, through heat and cold, Sweet lips of cherry, sweet heart of gold; Yet Gold-Heart surely shall come some day To cry for gray wings to fly away, Moirín, Moirín!” HATHOR I sit beneath my fig-tree, while my kine Pasture around me drowsily, knee-deep In lilies, chewing sweetest cud of sleep, While I sing softly to this wheel of mine. A skein of many-coloured threads I twine And know not why, or why indeed I sing Low, as the bees do in their wandering From lotus unto lotus round my shrine. My light is only sunset's: it burns low And lower yet these seasons till I dread The darkness creeping on me from the skies. I loved the full fair nights of long ago When Sphinx and Sekhet worked their mysteries! Then I rocked Horus: now I rock the dead. HELEN OF TROY I am that Helen, that very Helen, Of Leda, born in the days of old. Men's hearts were as inns that I might dwell in: Houseless I wander to-night and cold. Because man loved me, no God takes pity: My ghost goes wailing where I was Queen! Alas! my chamber in Troy's tall city, My golden couches, my hangings green! Wasted with fire are the halls they built me, And sown with salt are the streets I trod, Where flowers they scattered and spices spilt me. Alas that Zeus is a jealous God! Softly I went on my sandals golden; Of love and pleasure I took my fill; With Paris' kisses my lids were holden, Nor guessed I, when life went at my will That the fates behind me went softlier still. HERTHA I am the spirit of all that lives, Labours and loses and forgives. My breath's the wind among the reeds; I'm wounded when a birch-tree bleeds. I am the clay nest 'neath the eaves And the young life wherewith it brims. The silver minnow where it swims Under a roof of lily-leaves Beats with my pulses. From my eyes The violet gathered amethyst. I am the rose of winter skies, The moonlight conquering the mist. I am the bird the falcon strikes; My strength is in the kestrel's wing, My cruelty is in the shrikes. My pity bids the dock-leaves grow Large, that a little child may know Where he shall heal the nettle's sting. I am the snowdrop and the snow, Dead amber, and the living fir— The corn-sheaf and the harvester. My craft is breathed into the fox When, a red cub, he snarls and plays With his red vixen. Yea, I am The wolf, the hunter, and the lamb; I am the slayer and the slain, The thought new-shapen in the brain. I am the ageless strength of rocks, The weakness that is all a grace Being the weakness of a flower. The secret on the dead man's face Written in his last living hour, The endless trouble of the seas That fret and struggle with the shore, Strive and are striven with evermore— The changeless beauty that they wear Through all their changes; all of these Are mine. The brazen streets of hell I know, and heaven's gold ways as well. Mortality, eternity, Change, death, and life are mine—are me. HUGH, A CHILD Not star or flower, but lovelier than these The child came to us out of mysteries, And to the Giver We prayed that He should lay upon His gift Wisdom and health and sweetness, that his days Might flow like some fair river, Might go as bright and lightly as the ways Of a bird's wing in the blue summer lift. Now all the stars and all the flowers are his Near and dear neighbours; but our portion is Sorrow and discontent, Because so little way the child's feet went In this our twisting pathway, that they knew Only that grass was soft and speedwell blue— Not breath or touch of failure, little Hugh! And I, the stranger, make a song for him, The little child, run truant into dim Countries of dreams fulfilled, More dear and fair Perhaps than here our visions for him were; And I, who knew his love not, share his lack And fain would help his kindred call him back; But, being helpless, stand and see him pass Heavenwards again ere dew dries off the grass Or glow is off the dream-house we did build. I that would speak of comfort give no more Than foolish tears on handle of a door Fast bolted, that drop down like bitter myrrh. My hand is on the latch I dare not move: I stand outside the room of death and love— The mother's sacred room of love and grief. Here comfort withers like an autumn leaf, And hope's sweet eyes are dim, And none save she may seek to comfort him, And none, save God, may pass and pity her, Save God, the Giver, Who has the lambs in charge, and having given, Borrows, but takes not back, and in His heaven Gives the child a long life—yea, for ever and ever! HUGH OF THE HILL He comes from the mountains green To the yellow shore: A thousand years he's seen, And a thousand more. His hair is dark as the night, And gray as the sea Are the wonderful eyes whose light Grows soft for me. Hugh of the Hill has seen Colleens galore, Barefooted on the green Edge of the shore. Now they are laid away Under the earth, Grow neither sad nor gay For a fairy's mirth. Hugh of the Hill has made Some sore hearts glad; He has bidden the strong be afraid And the merry sad. He has given fairy gold To the miser's store: He has kissed the warm mouth cold And the light heart sore. Hugh of the Hill, I know, Loves me to-day. It is not he will go, Grown tired, away. But I shall go from the hearth That 's mine no more To the quiet bosom of Earth That is cradle and door. Hugh of the Hill, to-night Is mine alone. Kiss me, and hold me tight, Lest I be gone Into a chamber dark, Where you cannot come, Where you shall call and hark, And I lie dumb. Now I can hold you close And answer and hear, And kiss as a woman knows When her heart holds fear. So short is my time to flower, So long you will Seek love, and be glad but an hour, Hugh of the Hill! THE INN-KEEPER “My door stands always open— You weary souls, come in! For you that tire of music, Here silence doth begin. You shall not rise for dancing, Or follow wandering loves. Here in my yew-boughs whispers Only the voice of doves. “I 'll quench your thirst with water, Well-water, clear and sweet; I 'll bind about with linen Your weary hands and feet. Lie down upon my couches That are of marble hewn; You shall not lift your eyelids For sun or star or moon. “The wind, howe'er it whistles, Shall pierce no sleeper's ear, The rain, that wails and whimpers Can never enter here. You shall not hear men groaning For things that were divine, Flung to the outer darkness Or trampled down of swine. “Your peace no ghost shall trouble, And cry of beast or foe Shall sound with such a silence As sounds the falling snow. Darkness shall be your dwelling, With all your dreams therein. “Come in,” cries Death, the landlord, “You 'll find no better inn.” JACINTH (DEAF AND DUMB) Jacinth, Jacinth, where do you go With your eyes like spring and your step like snow? Who wrought, my Jacinth, your yellow hair In the self-same colour that daffodils wear When they open first to the kiss of spring And have heard no whisper of withering? Who gave you, Jacinth, your violet eyes Where sorrow close beside laughter lies? Who made your face like a soft white rose And your mouth like a blossom that no bee knows? Who made you timid and sweet and fair As a snowdrop first in the wintry air? Jacinth, turn to us, speak and say Are you fire or air, or sweet human clay? O little dumb mouth, will you never part Your twin red leaves though I break my heart? O small deaf ears, will you open not To any whisper of love begot? My fingers plead, and your fingers say Half in earnest, and half in play, “I 'm half a fairy, and no one knows The way to hold when a fairy goes.” And are you going, and must you pass, Little sweet Jacinth? Then, alas! I said, alas! that the child must go To the light above from the dusk below; I prayed wild prayers, but at last it fell That Jacinth went, and I said “'Tis well.” She never will hearken a cruel word That other women will hear and have heard; She never will say a word less sweet Than the small red mouth that utters it; She never will change from gold to clay. Jacinth, sweet, you are well away!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JACK O'LANTHORN AND OTHER POEMS JACK O'LANTHORN Can you not see me careless? Can you not feel me weak, Dear hands upon my heartstrings, dear lips upon my cheek? Out of a world of wandering men is this the man you seek? These eyes that look through yours, my dear, have looked into the pit, Will look again and yet again and linger over it: For there are lights that shine at nights not all in heaven lit. If I am Jack o' Lanthorn, sweet, a homeless thing am I. I cannot warm you but must see you cold until you die; Will you not choose a homely hearth to sit and warm you by? You choose the wildfire none the less, you'll follow where I go? Ah! steadfast heart and sweet heart, made strong for me to know, Although I go I will return; although I change and grow, Change and lessen, on your soul my wayward soul I stay, Your steady light my wandering light shall draw and feed and sway, And I will love you, sweet, as long as Jack o' Lanthorn may. JANUARY I am a mighty Hunter—a Hunter before the Lord; The lean white bears they know me and come and go at my word. The Northern Lights are my dancing girls; the Hunter Star 's my mate, And we talk o' nights of Diana dead, and the Gaul-folk at the gate. Oh golden head of Diana dead, if I came on your sleep one day And looked on you till passion grew and reason fled away, If I should kneel from your lips to steal, what would your blue eyes do? No arrows smite like your eyes' cold light, as well Orion knew. Oh sweet and stern, would you only turn, sighing amid your sleep, And dream again of some battle-plain and fire on some towered keep, And never dream you were kissed of him who walks in the endless snow, And may not sleep, though the dark be deep, till the Judgment Day doth glow? O stern and sweet, if I kissed your feet, would you wake and smile to foreknow Another life as estranged from strife as joy is estranged from woe? But 'tis best to sleep since the night is deep on Egypt and Greece and Rome And the dust is shed upon Hera's head, and Venus has passed in foam. Diana being silent now as any in the host Of mortals who to Hades have by Charon's ferry crost, Remembrance is not better than a deathless rose that I See bloom in token of the sun upon the evening sky. My servant, Wind, ere Fate did find herself too old to play, All unafraid 'twixt sun and shade, kissed half her gloom away, And gardens green he hath entered in, but counsel close keeps he, And what he knows of the rose, the rose, he will not sing to me. You have sung, God wot, of a hunter's lot, of bears in the ice-caves green, Of silent lips and of goodly ships that are not but have been. You have made a song of my north wind strong, of the track of my feet in the snow, But of strife that's mine and of life that's mine, what word do you rhymers know? You have painted me with a face before and a face that looketh back, But I go as a man to battle goes, and I turn not on my track. The stars 'twixt man and will of man their will may interpose: I do their Maker's pleasure for my own upon the snows. THE JESTER A Jester, a winner of empty laughter, Grew sick of life, and the life hereafter, Of sea, and sky, and the seasons four. “I will die,” he said, “as my mirth is dying, Lie down as the fallen tree is lying On Earth's brown bosom, and hear no more The madman's laughter, the sage's sighing.” The Jester went when his mood was sorest Into the heart of the autumn forest; Round him and past him in nerveless haste The dead leaves whirled in a helpless eddy. “Here,” said the Jester, “the year makes ready To die as gladly as I, to waste Like wine that 's spilled from a cup unsteady.” He lay in the leaves and a sound of laughter Rang through the forest: before him, after, Around, above him, the laughter swept. A girl came berrying down the hedges; The wind dropped dead at the forest edges As a bird from the stone that a slinger fledges. The woman came, and the man that slept In the Jester out of the dead leaves leapt; He caught her hands, and her heart he kept. JESUS AT BETHLEHEM (A Christmas Carol) Baby Christ in the manger Lay, with kine around. Softer than the woven silk, Warm as love, and white as milk Mary's arms He found; Snowflakes through the broken roof Made strewings for the ground. Little Christ in the garden Lay, and laughed to greet Roses of a hundred leaves, Red as skies on frosty eves, Damask-red and sweet. It was but a dying rose Made strewings for His feet. Man Christ into the city Through Hosannas rode: Grey old mothers prayed for Him, Tall centurions stayed for Him, Herds forgot the goad; Man and babe and maid for Him Green palm-branches strowed. Thus have I wrought my carol Out of drifted snow, Strewings of red rose-leaves fair, Palms that greenly grow. Let us make to-night for Thee Cold hearths kind and bright for Thee, Wash our stained hearts white for Thee, Lattices make light for Thee, Child, and Man, and Saviour, As of long ago. JUNE Dark red roses in a honeyed wind swinging, Silk-soft hollyhock, coloured like the moon; Larks high overhead lost in light, and singing; That 's the way of June. Dark red roses in the warm wind falling, Velvet leaf by velvet leaf, all the breathless noon; Far-off sea-waves calling, calling, calling; That 's the way of June. Sweet as scarlet strawberry under wet leaves hidden, Honeyed as the damask rose, lavish as the moon. Shedding lovely light on things forgotten, hope forbidden— That 's the way of June. KATHALEEN NY-HOULAHAN O Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan, your face is like a star, Your face has led me to your feet o'er wastes and waters far; Your face has made a day for me where only twilights are, O Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan, my star! O Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan, why loved I aught but you? I took a woman to my wife, and kind she was and true, But your gray eyes shone out on me within her eyes of blue, And, Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan, my soul went after you. O Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan, it's old I am and gray, I see the dead leaves blown about the closing of my day; The dead leaves, the red leaves, are rotting in my way, O Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan, to-day. O Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan, my Eily's grave is green, And I've grown old a-seeking your face through tears and teen: I 'll turn my feet from this straight path, where your white feet have been And turned the dry ferns young again and green. I'll turn my feet from every path but one—the churchyard way: I'll shut my eyes to every star, and sleep my fill till day; 'Tis Eily will awake me, and you it is will say “Rise up, play up, old piper, 'tis the dawning of the day.” THE KING OF IRELAND'S SON Now all away to Tir na n' Og are many roads that run, But he has ta'en the longest lane, the King of Ireland's son. Where Aongus goes there 's many a rose burns red 'mid shadows dun; No rose there is will draw his kiss, the King of Ireland's son. And yonder where the sun is high Love laughs amid the hay, But smile and sigh have passed him by, and never make delay. And here (and O! the sun is low!) they're glad for harvest won, But naught he cares for wheat or tares, the King of Ireland's son! And you have flung love's apple by, and I'm to pluck it yet; But what are fruits of gramarye with druid dews beset? Oh, what are magic fruits to him who meets the Lianan sidhe? Or hears athwart the distance dim Fionn's horn blow drowsily? The star is yours to win or lose, and me the dusk has won, He follows after shadows, the King of Ireland's son. THE THREE KINGS Out of the East we have followed a star, Gaspar, Melchior, Balthazar. I who am Melchior, bent and gray, Bear not lightly the toilsome way; Bear not gladly the shivering wind, Leagues before us and leagues behind. Crown and orb will not keep from the cold; I was a King, but now I am old. Many a battle and many a scar Marked out my cousin Balthazar: Of Gaspar the boy no harpers sing— Of a flowerless country the deedless King. But age and youth in the quest have met, And journeys come to the good end set; And lighting down by a stable door I bring the homage of Melchior. “I bring and give to the Holy Child Snowy pearls for the Undefiled, Rose-red rubies that put to shame Flower of sunset or flower of flame. Jasper, jacinth, and selenite, Sea-green beryl and malachite, Milky fires that in opals shine; Take, little King, for they all are Thine.” But mine-brought jewel or sea-wrought gem, The fair Child heeded not one of them. Then knelt and greeted Him, Balthazar, Swart and scarred from his last wild war. “Here, little King, is homage free— He knows not Herod who kneels to Thee. Gums I have brought Thee, sweet with spice As winds that blow out of Paradise, A lump of amber that fishers drew Up where the green sea meets the blue, A silver casket, a bag of musk, And a dagger carved from a wild beast's tusk.” But the young Child turned from the spice and gums, And now 'tis Gaspar who greeting comes. “My country lies near the sunrise: thence I have brought but a handful of frankincense And a little flasket of bitter myrrh. Poor is my land and the King of her, And out of our poortith thus I bring Gifts for a slave, not gifts for a King.” But deep in the young Child's quiet eyes We saw a flickering smile arise, And the little hands that were all too frail To grasp red ruby or silver pale, They closed and clung over Gaspar's gift— And we went forth in the blinding drift. The Child was scarce to a lad's height grown, When over my grave they laid the stone, With many a royal and wizard rite, And torches scaring afar the night. He had broken the seals on Lazarus set When Balthazar and his death-hour met. Gaspar wept over Him when He died, Kneeling and mourning the Cross beside, When the veil of the Temple was torn in twain, And the earth was rocking in travail-pain. We are dead and dust, and our realms forget That ever such Kings by a stable met, Yet we remember and rise and ride, Ghosts though we be, each Christmas tide. But the cock crows soon, and it well may be We shall ride Time down to Eternity. The clouds are heavy with more than rain, But we ride, for the Christ is come again, And we must meet Him as once of old, With gifts of frankincense, myrrh, and gold. LAÏS She was the lightest woman in the land; The homeless thistledown into your hand You might charm sooner, or the wild fire thrall, Than bring her wandering fancy to your call. Some few possessed her: many more desired To keep and tame her, but no man grew tired Of this slight thing, more swift to come and go Than a bird's shadow flickering on the snow. Her body's flower died, her soul went out. Poor little gilded taper, blown about By the great wind of Death, you were but meant To light some little room o'erbrimmed with scent. Poor rose, whose last red leaves drop slowly down, Not to smell sweet again in wreath or crown— Mimosa, touched and killed by careless hands, God speed your scared soul in those lightless lands! LAMENT OF THE LAY BROTHER (A.D. 598) Dedicated to Caroline Augusta Hopper Iona, O Iona! My days go sad and slow, For mid your island meadows I hear no cattle low. I miss the fields of Kerry, The green fields and the kine, And in my brothers' chanting Is heard no voice of mine— Iona, O Iona! Iona, O Iona! My mates are glad of cheer, But I, the Kerry peasant, Dwell sad and lonely here. I send an exile's sighing Across the sundering sea; O would I were in Kerry, Or the kine were here with me! Iona, O Iona! The Saint sleeps well, I trow, Nor dreams that one poor brother's Heartbroke for Ireland now— Heartbroke to be a herd-boy And watch the cattle feed, And call the cattle homewards Across the darkening mead. Iona, O Iona! All summer swallows stay About your towers: the sea-gulls To Ireland take their way. And would, I cry with weeping, The sea-gulls' road were mine— To hear the cattle lowing And see their eyes with mine, Iona, O Iona! LAMENT OF THE LAST LEPRECHAUN (To Caroline Augusta Hopper) For the red shoon of the Shee, For the falling o' the leaf, For the wind among the reeds, My grief! For the sorrow of the sea, For the song's unquickened seeds, For the sleeping of the Shee, My grief! For dishonoured whitethorn-tree, For the runes that no man reads Where the grey stones face the sea, My grief! Lissakeole, that used to be Filled with music night and noon, For their ancient revelry, My grief! For the empty fairy shoon, Hollow rath and yellow leaf, Hands unkissed to sun or moon, My grief—my grief! THE LISTENERS I. (To E. Nesbit) Last night, last night, in the dark o' the moon Into my dreams slid a fairy tune. It slew the dreams that I dreamed of him With its moonshine music, faint and dim. What tune should the fairy pipers play But “Over the Hills and Far Away.” The music called to my idle feet, And O! the music was wild and sweet: I left my dreams and my lonely bed And followed afar where the music led, And never a tune did the pipers play But “Over the Hills and Far Away.” Over the hills and far away, What love has tenderer words to say? Love that lifteth or bows the head, Love that liveth or love that's dead? Hills that are far away are fair, And I followed the ghost of my lover there. We danced all night in a silent band, I and my lover, hand in hand; We danced, nor knew till the dew was dry That deep slept Donat and lone slept I. We took no thought of the coming day Over the hills and far away. My eyes are blind with the growing light, And O my grief, that the day was night! For my heart is broke for my lover's eyes, And all day long in my ears there cries The tune of the fairy pipes that play “Over the Hills and Far Away.” THE LISTENERS II. (To Katharine Tynan) There's many feet on the moor to-night, and they fall so light as they turn and pass, So light and true that they shake no dew from the featherfew and the hungry grass. I drank no sup and I broke no crumb of their food, but dumb at their feast sat I. For their dancing feet and their piping sweet, now I sit and greet till I 'm like to die. Oh kind, kind folk, to the words you spoke I shut my ears and I would not hear, And now all day what my own kin say falls sad and strange on my careless ear; For I 'm listening, listening, all day long to a fairy song that is blown to me Over the broom and the canna's bloom, and I know the doom of the Ceol Sidhe. I take no care now for bee or bird, for a voice I 've heard that is sweeter yet. My wheel stands idle; at death or bridal apart I stand and my prayers forget. When Ulick speaks of my wild-rose cheeks, and his kind love seeks out my heart that's cold, I take no care, though he speaks me fair, for the new love casts out the love that's old. I take no care for the blessed prayer, for my mother's hand or my mother's call. There ever rings in my ear, and sings, a voice more dear, more sweet than all. Cold, cold's my breast, and broke 's my rest, and O it's blest to be dead I'd be, Held safe and fast from the fairy blast, and deaf at last to the Ceol Sidhe! THE LONELY BODY It's far away in London I am dwelling now; I hear no more the wind that blows the green leaves on the bough. My cup is strange and bitter with the homeless tears I shed, And bitter in my mouth is the stranger's bread. But about the well I dipped from, in the fields where I played, There cries a voice so like my voice my own folk are afraid— A voice of tears and laughter, a voice that climbs and thrills In the hazel boughs and on the distant hills. 'Tis nothing but my body that dwells in London here, And walks among the endless streets, with neither hope nor fear To quicken listless feet or kindle sullen face With longing for the ended race. We care not much who win or lose, not shining is our goal; It's bread to eat is all our quest. If hungry goes the soul, The body's hunger keener is, and in the city street Pale women strive beside the men for bread to eat. Above our heads the chimneys reek, and if the wet wind blow No labour stops, no eyes look up to watch the rainbow grow. The river turns from gray to black; the stars come out and fade; Beneath the flaring gas-lamps we ply our trade. 'Tis nothing but my body that is so weary now, And eats and drinks and sleeps in spite of hopes that tempt and cow; 'Tis nothing but my body that earns the wage you dole, But far away in Ireland is my free soul. Far away in Ireland, and would that I were there, To feel the wet wind blowing the grayness from my hair, To hear the kind sea calling the gulls that rockward go, And the men to their drowning with its “hush, hush O!” Far away in Ireland, my soul is far away From these your streets that roar by night as restless as by day; It is my lonely body that on the bed I made Lies down to rest, and does not rest, and dreams that it is dead And buried deep in Irish earth with a grey stone overhead. LOVE'S SINGER. I. If I had been a Rose If I had been a rose And not a woman, would your feet have stayed A moment in their passing, and in shade That meeting boughs of lime and lilac made Would you have stood, and softly touched my flower, Making me redder, and breathèd in my dower Of sweetness? Would you gather me, I wonder, Or pass without a word, and leave me under My shading leaves to watch my bloom grow dry. Ah, would you have unkindly passed me by If I had been a rose? If I had been a rose, You had been kinder than to leave me there, Spilling my sweetness out, half in despair, And half because remembering is so rare. 'Tis easy withering roses, even in June! Too rough a wind-touch, or too bright a noon, The red leaves drop and show the gold heart under Past dream or daring, past desire or wonder. Ah, yet be gentle though no rose am I! My tears are in my heart—my heart were dry If I had been a rose. LOVE'S SINGER. II. Elusion What would you do if I should give you roses Who gave you only lilies yesterday? If I should leave my idle pretty play Among my shaded sheltered lily-closes, And give you roses? If in an hour I changed from girl to woman And gave you back your kisses, each for each— And chose, instead of music, passionate speech? Nay, but I will not, seeing Love's but human, Unveil the woman. I 'll keep my mystery and keep my lover; You who have hung with praise and dream my name, Being mere man, would find your praise half blame, If in my soul, full measure running over, You saw my love for you, not flowers, but flame. LOVE'S SINGER. III. A Sleep Song O Sleep, go, Sleep, hasten to my lover; Leave my eyelids all forlorn of thy quiet breath. Where my love lies wakeful, go thou and lean over, Singing low, singing low, dearest child of Death. Fair Sleep, rare Sleep, Death that is thy father, Night that is thy mother, both sow flowers for thee; White poppies dashed with dew, drowsy flowers to gather, Yellow rose that silence saith to the busiest bee. Hear, Sleep, dear Sleep, ere my song be ended, Gather me thy fairest flowers a soft dream to make For my love—a dream of scent and of music blended. Ay, and let me kiss the dream for the dreamer's sake. O Sleep, blow sleep-dust upon his pillow Till he dreams it is my breast, and to dream is fain; Let him think it is my hair, not thy branch of willow, Dark against the little light through the rain-blurred pane. LOVE'S SINGER. IV. The Promise What shall I make of my life, Dear? what shall I bring to you, Flower of fair colour, song of tremulous sweep? Bird that o'er waters of tears on a faithful wing to you Finds out her way, with a roseleaf for you to keep? Shell in whose chamber remembered waves shall sing to you Chimes of sleep? Bird that homes to you, song that shall sigh and sing to you, Flower that knoweth its passion, and knoweth not doubt, Shell that whispers a musical memory out? Nay, I will make of my life a more lovely thing to you, Passionate hands, my Heart, that shall clasp you and cling to you, Daylight and dreaming, living and dying throughout. LOVE'S SINGER. V. A Love Song Are you in the moonlight? No more mine eyes are holden: I see the light that lightens you; the air you breathe I know. The spring is green beneath you and above you all is golden, And while the moon is clear for you I cannot darkling go. Are you in the darkness where voices cry about you? Your darkness makes my pathway blind, your pain is sharp in me. I can hear the tones that trouble you and lure you and flout you; My grief is round about your grief as round a ship the sea. I 'm yours and I love you in dreams and out of dreaming; I am yours when you forget me and yours when you recall. When you are at your weariest, the ravens round you screaming, Am I not close beside you, Dear? I see and hear it all. Am I yours as you're mine? For you cannot put away My faithful soul from your soul, if my body lets it go. My joy is yours, your sorrow mine; and your gloom is on my day, And my light in your night shall be a star for you to know. LOVE'S SINGER. VI. Glamour Out of my window I looked last night; Under my window the world lay white. Strong black shadows marked bush and tree, And I wondered long how this change might be— Had the snow stolen on us when none could see? Whiter and whiter the wonder grew, And the magic of moonlight at last I knew; With her ghostly light she had mocked the snow, And the sleeping houses would never know That the streets beneath them lay glamoured so. And I thought, as I looked at the street grown strange, How the face of the world with a dream can change, How love, like the moon that I could not see, Makes whiter and fairer than snow can be My thought of my lover, his thought of me. LOVE'S SINGER. VII. Comrades Give me the reed you lean on; if a spear My hand shall bleed for 't as your hand has bled I will not cover up my sheltered head While you are houseless in the moonlight here. I must have half your hope and half your fear. I must go shares in all you drink and eat, Though it be bread of sorrow and cup of tears. Sheaves that you gather are my harvest, Dear. Because I glean beside you down the years, Your shadow 's never lonely at your feet. And though all things turn ashes that were sweet, In deeps below and in the deeps above you, In moods that strengthen you and moods that weaken Perplexed in shadow, led by starry beacon, I go with you, my lover, and I love you. LOVE'S SINGER. VIII. A Homing Song Turn your eyes to me, turn your heart to me, Out of the trouble of daily things. Out of your labour your love-thoughts start to me Homing surely as if they had wings, Out of the grimy and garrulous mart to me— Birds that home to my heart that sings. Birds that home through the world of cages To the free sweet heaven where love is light, Come through the crowd that clamours for wages, Kestrel and pyat and crow and kite. Here is the place which the longing of sages Sought and missed, between day and night. Winds are wild when they 're loosed from tether, But the wind that blows you to me is kind. Come then, come, though the evil weather Throw cloud on to cloud till the day be blind. Come to my heart and there together Nestle, my birds, and be glad of night That sets the wrongs of the long day right. LOVE'S SINGER. IX. Love in September The garden lay about us twain, Hoarding its sweets up for the rain; We clung together, you and I, And heard the minutes hurrying by. Heart against heart beat heavily; Your eyes through twilight sought for mine; My lips drank love from yours like wine. Our lips together met and clung— Our love stood beautiful and young And watched us while the minutes spun Webs of delight not yet undone, While our lips, kissing, would not part, While all the night beat like a heart Fuller of fire than is the sun And one great star and only one Above us for a lantern hung. My hand in yours so closely lay, I felt your pulse beat like my own; I breathed your breath, and in my brain The seed of your own thought was sown. The garden walls seemed far away; The scent of flowering mint was blown About us in the gloaming gray. Twilight and scent for us became Delicate dreams, and for our sake No bat or buzzing chafer came The happy silences to break. We kissed, and to the lighted room Came, carrying with us like perfume As lovely as the rose's name, The memory of the twilight sweet In shining eyes and laggard feet. LOVE'S SINGER. X. Southernwood So I have harvested my womanhood Into one tall green bush of southernwood; And if the leaves are green about your feet, And if my fragrance on a day should meet And brace your weariness, why, not in vain Shall I have husbanded from sun and rain My spices if you chance to find them sweet. I have grown up beneath the sheltering shade Of roses: roses' poignant scents have made My sharp spice sweeter than 't was wont to be. Therefore if any vagrant gather me And wear me in his bosom, I will give Him dreams of roses; he shall dream and live, And wake to find the rose a verity. Gather me, gather. I have dreams to sell. The sea is not by any fluted shell More faithfully remembered than I keep My thought of roses, through beguiling sleep And the bewildering day. I 'll give to him Who gathers me more sweetness than he 'd dream Without me—more than any lily could; I that am flowerless, being southernwood. LOVE'S SINGER. XI. A Woman's Marriage-song I have shed my orange blossom: I have put aside my veil, my head is bare. I have doffed my snowy shining satin wear. In my long straight gown of white, With no garland in my hair, Am I fair? Am I fair enough for you, my love, to-night? When the music swelled to meet me did I falter? But my feet kept step with your feet from the altar, And my heart with yours kept beat. Now I stay my questing feet— Now beside your soul mine stands, And my heart is in your hands Beating upwards like a flame, And the sigil set upon it is your name. My veil is off: no more my laces cover The bird that sings so loudly in my bosom. Can you hear it now the wedding hymns are over? Than my veil Does my hair make softer shadow for my face, This shadow that with kisses you displace, Till I grow a rose that came to you so pale? Am I sweet enough without my orange-blossom? I have put aside my veil and orange-blossom. Unclouded, love, I enter into life As gladly as the moon comes from her shadow And floods the fen with silver and the meadow. Now my maids are gone and musicking is over, And without the door stands sorrow Bidding hush the bird that's singing in my bosom. Will my music be as sweet for you to-morrow When Time has paled the kisses of your wife? Is my love so strong that you must be my lover All my life?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE HAPPY MAID AND OTHER POEMS THE HAPPY MAID (To Caroline Augusta Hopper) All the mills in the world are grinding gold grain, All hearts in the world like my heart should be fain, For my foot goes in time to a holiday measure And the bird in my bosom is singing for pleasure. Tall soldiers in gold stand the plumed ranks of corn, And the poppies are dancing for joy of the morn; They 're gipsies and vagrants, the home-keepers say, But my heart is at one with the poppies to-day. I know not what end to my travel shall be, Or what fairy Prince rides a-seeking for me. He may be a Sheogue in graithing of gold, Or a greybeard who tarries for young maids and old. Meanwhile I go tramping the merry world over, With the flower of my heart folded close for my lover: Folded safely and close till my Prince come and claim The bud long asleep, and the flower turn a flame. Meanwhile I go tramping, a masterless maid, With flowers blowing for me in sunshine and shade, White poppies, red poppies, sea poppies of amber, And a wreath for my head of all wild vines that clamber. I am one with the wind and the flowers in the corn, And I and the wind laugh aloud in our scorn At the bedesmen who quarrel earth's meadow-lands over, While there 's roses on bushes and honey in clover. THREE MAIDS We three went out together— Margery, Maud and I, In April's last soft weather, Ere the May dawn drew nigh. We washed our faces in may-dew, And saw the moon fade in the blue Waste highlands of the sky. We maids went out a-maying, To seek what we could find, And fairy pipes were playing Before us and behind. We could not see the Pixy-folk, Or hear the mocking words they spoke, For blowing of the wind. Maud found a black lamb straying, And took the sheep-fold way. Margery went a-maying, Sullen, but came back gay Because she found an amber comb. She took a fairy treasure home; I only brought home may. When in her yellow tresses The amber comb we see, Wives curse, and no man blesses This maid called Margery. Her beauty is a hunter's snare; Men's souls are netted in her hair And cannot come forth free. We three heard Pixies blowing Their pipes. Two of the three Can hear the long grass growing, The winter wind can see. Maud's in her grave, nor cares nor knows Whether the stray lamb comes or goes, And I am as a folded rose Till a Pixy gather me. MARCH I go beneath triumphal arches Of linden-yellow and ash-green: I hang upon the elms and larches The colours of my May, the queen. Before me goes the first wild swallow; For me the daffodils delay: After my feet the flagflowers follow And gorse grows gold about my way. Two wings are pinions at my shoulder; Two wings are plumes upon my feet: The earth that drowsed grows younger, bolder, And with warm mouth my kiss doth meet. MATER DOLOROSA A Winter Song Earth takes but little pleasure to remember— Being a widow now, that was a wife— How sweet May was, how bountiful September, What wayward music April's chanter blew. Her leaping fires of life Burn down beneath the fall of frosty dew, And dwindle slowly to the last red ember That is December. She knows not how it went, the Linus-song Whose burden the brown reapers bore along As they brought home the sheaves. Nay, though the thistle yielded figs, from thorn Though purple grapes were born, She would not wonder. She is past surprise; The certainty of grief is in her eyes, And that she once was glad she scarce believes. She dares not pray for summer to return. Against her eyelids burn The tears that fall not,—for what use are tears? Above her head a naked plane-tree rears Wild arms of all despair, Reaching out blindly through the frosty air For its beloved leaves that rotting lie Where Winter with his ménie has passed by. Under the touch of their empoisoned spears, The fair and gallant wood That all the summer-time green-coated stood, Stands naked to the bone, and wrings its hands Above the altered lands. Earth watches while her little children die— The frozen wasp, the starving butterfly. She has no tears for them, but in her heart Knife-edged the Seven Sorrows wake and start. MONDAY Oh, fair of face stands Monday At threshold of the week, A lily in her breastknots, A rose upon her cheek. In kilted gown of russet Her daily bread to seek, She passes o'er the threshold, Smiling, and does not speak. She bears across her shoulder A bough of blossomed may: Still in her ears are ringing Church-bells of yesterday. She is as glad to labour As Sunday was to pray— But why she goes a-smiling She will not ever say. OCTOBER I 'm shod with mist and crowned with fire; I wear the opal of desire. As grey as water is my gown, That rustles over leaves grown brown. Above my head the kestrels hang, The wild geese go with whirr and clang Of passing wings, the plovers cry Above me in a yellow sky. I have the Scorpion for my star, And all fair things my kindred are, All dreams too sweet for man to bear, All visions builded of despair. I am a queen, yet govern none That laughs or weeps beneath the sun. I wear the opal and I wear The desert sands amid my hair. OSIRIS (To William Beer) O judge us kindly, Thou that judgest rightly All things that mortal are. We are but men who lift our weak hands nightly To every wandering star. Thy sisters are the End and the Beginning; Thine is the empty hearth, Thine, too, the peaceful sleep for all men's winning In kindly earth And Thine the souls that wake from sleep to sinning, Osiris. We saw Thee not, Lord, in the crowded city, And in the market-place Heard not the falling of Thy feet. Have pity; Let thy queen's hidden face Be softened with Thy mercy at our crying. Thy hand that slew painted the lotus-blossom And sowed love's seed in the kind mother's bosom. By Philæ where Thy mortal part is lying, We know Thou livest and that we are dying, Osiris! Thou knowest we are weak: that we are strong We know not, for like waves We fall and shatter, and a bridal song Breaks music round our graves. We are the strings that help Thy harp to sweetness. Alas! we only sing Sweet things o'erthrown, the blow that ends completeness, Artist and King! Thine is the dream, and Thine the dawn that breaks it. We can but dream and die. Thou art the song, Thou Silence that o'ertakes it And answers every cry. Beside the labouring kine the neatherd trudgeth. At noon Thou makest earth of him again. We cry against Thee, “Who art Thou That judgeth, Maker Who marrest men?” OUTLAWS Six good years of sweetness in the greenwood shaw, Sweetness plucked and eaten, spite of God and law; Six good years of loving under sun and rain. Now that law has spoken and not six hours remain, What have we to gird at, now the end is here? Law nor God can take from us those six years, my Dear. God indeed was kind to us, kinder than we knew, For we found forbidden fruit sweetness through and through. Hazel-nuts were brown for us, blackberries were sweet; Little brooks called pleasantly to our homeless feet. Nought we cared though on our track hound and bugle cried: Six years long the shaw itself fought upon Love's side. Glad am I of every sun that we saw arise, Leaves that matched your russet hair, flowers that matched your eyes: Glad am I of every sun that we watched go down, Frost that made the meadows white and the kingfern brown. Glad am I of nights and days full of quick alarms, Winds and rains that made you lie closer in my arms. Winds could never come between in the wildest weather: Desperate days and hunted nights we found sweet together. Rain and hail were good to us, and the leaping thunder; Not a sign in all the sky put our arms asunder, Now our wanderings are done, and the joy we stole We must hence to pay for it, soul by naked soul: We who laughed at law, to-day give law its due, But we go from law to God, dear, I and you. ST. PATRICK'S BLESSINGS Have you heard of good St. Patrick how once he went his way East and west through Ireland for many a night and day, North and south through Ireland? and everywhere he trod The world was better for his feet, and greener was the sod. He saw the dark seals swimming in waters of the west, He lifted up his hands to heaven and all their tribes he blessed; He saw the wicked butcher-birds that their own comrades slew, And none the less he blessed them, for “they know not what they do.” He saw the green sap running in many a forest tree, He blessed them, and he blessed the ships whose masts their stems should be; He blessed the flower for what she was, the beauty of an hour— “Man passes, and he leaves behind less fragrance than a flower.” The gods that were, St. Patrick blessed, and all fair fantasies That have made men more deep of heart, more strange to sloth and ease. He blessed the dreams too beautiful to be made true on earth; He blessed the mystery of death, the mystery of birth. He came back to his clerics, and in his eyes they saw The clear light of God's kindness more lovely than God's law; And to his dying day he bore, for all to understand, The beauty of that time when he went lonely through the land With blessings on the lips of him and blessings in each hand. THE PEOPLE OF THE DEW If you can rokker Romany And wish the gipsy well, Come tramp the fern beside me Up hill and over fell. I'll show you where the deadwort grows, Where witchbells cluster blue, And where the foxgloves ring at night For People of the Dew. They 're wayward folk and wandering And wastrel folk as we— They take their gear where'er it comes; They love no walls to see. They milk the kye and scare the birds, A gay and idle crew— And spae the stars like Romanies, The People of the Dew. Like us, they come from far away, Like us, must wander far; Their kin is Jack o' Lanthorn And every falling star. They 're of the water and the wind, And of the fixed earth, you; But nought can stay and nought affray The People of the Dew. Whoever hears them singing Will love no other song. Whoever sees them dancing Must rise and tramp along, And take the highway for his path Winter and summer through, And follow, follow till he finds The People of the Dew. They're hiding in the elder tree, And in the bracken brown, And one will go in tattered rags, One in a silken gown; But you may know them by their eyes That sorrow never knew. They've looked on life and looked past death, The People of the Dew. THE PIPER The Piper comes and the Piper goes; His pipe is carven of willow-wood. One tune of it changes our beating blood To water: another tune he blows And fire's in our feet, but no man knows If sad or glad be the Piper's mood. He plants sweet grapes and he gathers sloes, Uproots the cherry, and leaves the weed, Leans on a spear, though his hand must bleed, And loveless ever mid lovers goes, Though all hearths listen for him, he knows, And covered for him is the fire's red seed. The Piper's eyes are as deep as the sea, Sea-gray, sea-green; and what man can tell That meets his eyes if 'tis ill or well To look and forget, or remember and be For ever under the Piper's spell, Swayed by him as a wind-swayed tree? Over the world the red wind blows, Darkens the sea and veils the sun. The Piper under the twilight goes And shepherds our wandering wills as one: The web of our thoughts is by him undone. Who leads the Piper there's no one knows. ROBIN HOOD'S GOOD-NIGHT Good-night, good-night, Heart's Dearest. The Hunter holds the sky; There wakes no soul in Sherwood save Little John and I. 'Twixt thee and me the grasses grow thick and soft and green, And falls a drift of hawthorn above thee for a screen. 'Twixt thee and me, Heart's Dearest, the grass is green. Shall I not soon, Heart's Dearest, good-morrow to thee say, And kiss thy lips of kisses forlorn for many a day? Shall I bid thee good-morrow, good-night to Little John, And lay me down beside thee to slumber sweetly on, Nor dream of lonely Sherwood, nor Little John? Shall we go seek, Heart's Dearest, that land of afternoon, Where lovers to their lasses pipe out a sleepy tune, Where care may never enter, and love grow never cold, Where Allan walks, a-harping a tune we knew of old? Shall we not journey thither, O heart of gold? SEPTEMBER I am of many moods and many shapes; I strip the chestnut and I tread the grapes. The pulse of life runs high within my veins; My hands and lips are red with berry stains. I bid the leaves from all their dances cease And die a golden death. And I release The spell of summer, so that all remember Winter and death at beck of me, September. THE PASSING OF THE SHEE And did you meet them riding down A mile away from Galway town? Wise childish eyes of Irish gray, You must have seen them, too, to-day. And did you hear wild music blow All down the boreen, long and low, The tramp of ragweed-horses' feet And Una's laughter, wild and sweet? Oh, once I met them riding down A hillside far from Galway town, But not alone I walked that day To hear the fairy pipers play. They lighted down, the kindly Shee; They builded palace-walls for me. They built me bower, they built me bawn, Ganconagh, Banshee, Leprechaun. They builded me a chamber fair Roofed in with music, walled with air, And in its garden, fair to sight, Grew wallflowers, windflowers, brown and white. Bouchaleen bwee, if you should see One riding with the happy Shee, One with blue eyes and yellow hair, Less light of heart than many there, Ah! tell him that I'm seeking still Our fairy hold by fairy hill, Following the fairy pipes that play Over the hills and far away. SHEEP IN A STORM The herons from the marsh have gone, Beholding how the dark draws on. The beech-tree yonder on the hill, Where silly sheep are feeding still, 'Twixt light and lightning shuddering stands, A landmark between alien lands— Each leaf aghast in the hot breath That whispers to all trees of death. The sheep feed stolidly, nor know How near their heads the lightnings go; The old tower not more careless stands Of human wrath and human hands Than these meek things that without fear The lightnings see, the thunders hear, Nor cease from feeding to and fro. THE SHEPHERD OF THE SEA. I am a mighty shepherd, and many are my flocks; I lead them, I feed them among the weedy rocks; My shepherd's crook is fashioned out of a Norway pine, And there's no sheep-dog in the world will herd these flocks of mine. My fold is wide, and day and night the walls shift of my fold. No upland, no lowland, my lambing ewes withhold From the cry of their shepherd, the beckoning of his hand; For my own desert places they leave the pasture-land. With wild white fleeces surging about me to my knee, I go about my herding, the Shepherd of the Sea; I call to the rock-pastures the white sheep of the waves, For they but find their grazing where sailors find their graves. I am a mighty shepherd, and mighty flocks have I; I lead them, I feed them while stars are in the sky; And when the moon is waning on sheltered shore and lee, I rest not nor slumber, the Shepherd of the Sea. SILK OF THE KINE. I (To Caroline Augusta Hopper) Silk of the kine, do not those great waves grow Weary of lashing granite shores of thine, Shores that decay, and death will never know, Silk of the kine? Are not thy soft eyes tired of shade and shine, And thy kind lips a-weary, drinking so, For many years a black and bitter wine? Take comfort, Gra Machree: the years are slow, Yet bring the day (tho' not for eyes of mine) When thou shalt rise up crowned above thy foe, Silk of the kine! SILK OF THE KINE. II (To Coulson Kernahan) Silk o' the kine, it's long you've strayed away Into the meadows thro' the twilight gray, And though we stand and call when night is near And draws the weary cattle homeward here, You never come, nor any pishogue may Bring you to us at dawning o' the day, Silk o' the Kine. Mannanan drives his cattle from the sea At sundown, but no heart to watch have we For thinking on our own that's strayed so far Beyond the shining of the hunter's star, For thinking on you and your silk coat fine, Silk o' the Kine! We have no heart to heed the thrush's song, The hound's deep note, the blackbird's fluting long (The song Fionn loved at Derrycarn of streams). Our hearts are wandering with you in our dreams, Nor can we turn our sorrow into song. My grief, my grief! we've missed you over-long, Silk o' the Kine. SPRING SONG The Spring is at the door; She bears a golden store, Her maund with yellow daffodils runneth o'er. Her rosy feet are bare, The wind is in her hair, And O her eyes are April eyes, very fair. After her footsteps follow The mullein and the mallow; She scatters golden powder on the sallow. She brings the crocus white And golden aconite: She brings desire and doubting and delight. THE STRANGERS They bought her, not with Irish knife, But with their Danish gold: They brought her from her father's hall, From faces kind to faces cold In her new lord's hold. They laid strange hands on her joyous life, And bade the bird in her breast to sing An altered song with a folded wing; And the Irish maid was a Danish wife In the Strangers' Forts (and she heard, she heard All night the cry of an alien bird That would not sing for the Strangers Who dwelt in Donegal). They took her over running water, And loosed our kindly chain; And Danish son and Danish daughter She bare unto her Dane. She sang their songs, and in the singing Her childish tunes forgot, And she remembered not The kindlier hearts that years were bringing Joy and pain That were none of hers, though deep the gladness And keen the pain; For she knew no grief but the near-hand sadness That vexed the Dane, And her joy was the joy of an outland lord And gay she sat at the outland board In the highest hall. (But it would not sing for a Danish call, The bird in her breast that must make its nest In the Strangers' Forts with the Strangers That dwelt in Donegal.) She bore him three fair daughters, And one tall son, whose name The Danish minstrels lifted up, Even as one lifts a golden cup Filled to the lips with fame. Then over the shadowy waters She saw Hy-Brasail gleam, And she laid her down on her carven bed, Most white and fair and sweet to see As a dream remembered piteously When we grow too old to dream; And “Being but dead,” She said, “I bid you carry me Like a maiden back to my own country, Not like a wife long wed. Take off my girdle and jewels all, My shining keys and my Irish knife: Bid my maids go at my daughters' call, And my heathen thrall May serve my son, for my toils are done, And no other care I have save this, that ye bear me back On the homeward track, With a strait blue gown for my only wear, With folded fingers and unbound hair As I was ne'er a wife; For I cannot sleep, being dead, In the Strangers' Forts, with the Strangers That dwell in Donegal.” (And dead she lay, and above her bed A bird's voice cried, till the light o'erhead Grew dark to the evenfall, And its cry was the cry of the Strangers That dwelt in Donegal.) Now, her alien kin, and her alien mate, We held deep in hate— We that were once her own, We from whose griefs her heart had grown, And whose joys, mavrone, Passed by her door (and she had not known), We that by cold hearths sat alone When her thread was shorn By envious hands of a Danish Norn. And mavrone, mavrone, but we liked it ill That they did her dying will And bore her homeward as she had said With empty hands and unveiled head Like a maiden still; And we hated more when they raised no wail Above her cairn, Standing dumb and stern, Drinking “God-speed” in her burial-ale While our women shrieked and with faces pale Stood and cursed our mountain kerne. And now we are sad, for our hate is shed Abroad on the wings of the wind, and dead As Eivir, as Eivir. And home to his hall Scathlessly goes the Dane. And the cock we reared, the cock that's red, Crows not on his castle-wall. But the bird, the bird we loved best of all, It sits and sings in his lonely hall. Mavrone! for her bosom-bird And its singing voice we have not heard O'er her grave in the Holy Isle, Nor yet in the dusk o'er her maiden bed, In the hold where she was born, Sings it by night or morn. But it sings most sweet and clear For her Danish kin to hear, And its song is sad and its song is glad Like a sigh that grows to a smile; For she loved us both, but death turns love cold, And they bring us back our dead to hold, So they loved her best, the Strangers That dwell in Donegal.) THE SPIRIT OF SUMMER My cap is made of thistledown; Woven of green grasses is my gown. My veil is made of gossamer. Butterflies fan me with their wings, And many shy and timid things, Covered in feathers or in fur, Seek me for safety when the storm Blows up; the hare forsakes her form And in my shadow lieth warm. The squirrel has no thought of fear, He perches on my shoulder here And cracks his nuts; and shrew-mice come To do me suit and service dumb. Once at Heaven's gate I sat all day And sang and harped and would not cease. I was too happy to know peace; But now I walk a better way. Now on the good green earth I dwell And have sweet humble tasks to do, To brim the foxglove's spotted bell With honey, and to fill with dew The honeysuckle's drinking horn, Creamy and crimson. Every morn I bid the buttercups arise And open wide their golden eyes, And every night I shake down sleep On labouring lives. 'Tis mine to keep Earth's little children safe and sound And all the woodland holy ground. THE SUNFLOWER The sunflower bows upon her breast Her golden head, and goes to rest Forgetting all the days that were When she was young and proud and fair And in the glowing August air Bees came and sought and found her sweet. Now earth is cold about her feet, And wasps forsake her, and the sun No longer seeks her for the one Flower in his splendid image made. Her beauty's done, her farewell said. Her large leaves fold in weary wise, And heavy are her great brown eyes. The living rubies that would run Across her discs that mocked the sun— The ladybirds—sleep everyone. The great stalk stoops towards the earth Where all dreams end, whence all have birth. The hive-bee has forgotten quite How once he loved her, for the night Has come wherein no bee can spy Sweet in this flower dead and dry. SWORD AND FIRE It was welded in fire of Eve's own kindling, and tempered in tears that Lilith wept, Fire that was tended of Dhoul and Druid and Gods that woke while the others slept; And the fire was hallowed with prayers and sighing of saints that took it for sleeping-place, With life unborn and with life undying, with prayers unanswered and granted grace. The fire was watched of the dark Fomoroh, from wistful twilight to windy dawn, De Dananns fed it with quicken-branches, the wild Shee came from their dancing lawn! They sang wild songs to the red fire 's flashing; they sang to the red fire 's falling glow, And ours are the fire and the sword it welded, but free for us now the wild songs go. The fire 's forlorn of the wayward singing, but rich it kindles and richer now By crimson stones that the dark Fomoroh stripped for its pleasure from breast and brow. It called for wood and we brought it quicken; it cried for dew and we brought it blood; We sent pale colleens its flame to strengthen, to tread the deeps of its crimson flood. We gave it blood and we gave it blossoms, gold coins and amber and golden hair, King's daughters fed with their flower its hunger, and the sons of kings were its playthings fair. Its eager arms for a Danann princess reached out not long in a vain desire; It has given the sword to be our servant, and we are the servants of the fire. UNA OF THE WEST (To Caroline Augusta Hopper) It's “Una, Una, Una!” The birds cry after me, When I go back at sunset Into my own country. With “Una, Una, Una,” They will not let me be. With Druid leaves they crowned me The mistress of the Shee, East wind and west they gave me, For hounds to follow me. Mine are the yellow ragweeds, And mine the quicken tree. I teach the dreaming colleen How she her love may win: I wake old harps from silence To wail for days of Fionn: I make the long grass greener That folds Saint Idé in. It's “Una, Una, Una,” Birds sing and will not stay; And not a plover whistles Or lark dare greet the day Until I come from westward And bid the night away. VAGRANTS And first the Night, lost in her wild black hair, Came crooning down the valleys to Kenmare, Crooning an old song lost the raths amid, Far fallen from love and grace, Since days when first the darkness Oscar hid And covered Niam's face: Night, moving slowly, lost in visions sweet And all the cabins listening for her feet. And after her came Dawn, As swift and wild and shy as any fawn. A glimmer of grey eyes, and moonlit hair, A flutter in the air— A cry of wakening birds, that hardly may Believe so near the day: Her feet went by like shadows; from her track You saw the dreams draw back. Then Day came, woman grown, and gravely sweet, With steady eyes and undelaying feet: She had no time for dreams, nor yet for song, For all day long Barefooted, 'mid the children born of her, She worked among the fields a harvester.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE WAITING WIDOW AND OTHER POEMS THE WAITING WIDOW In the dark o' the day He shall come to my door, He that died far away From the Irish shore. I'll make to him the bed, And tire my widowed head, When he comes from the dead In the dark o' the day. My hands shall drop with myrrh On door-latch and handle; My sleeping fire I'll stir And quench my watchful candle. I shall be fair and young, And in my mouth a song. Oh, 'tis long, long, long, Till the dark o' the day. In the dark o' the day He will come to my door. No greeting will he say, But cross my threshold o'er. My groping hands he'll take; My heart, long like to break, With full delight he'll slake In the dark o' the day. In the dark o' the day We shall lie down to sleep; I will not see the gray Dawn through the window creep. I'll hold him to my breast So close, so dearly pressed, My life shall be his guest In the dark o' the day. My life shall be his guest, And mine his death shall be, And lying on his breast Death shall come sweet to me. But now I dare not die Because November's nigh, And my dear may yet come by In the dark o' the day. WINDS The wind came crying from the East, And blew the churchyard-grass aside As if to read forgotten names. It tossed the very altar-flames, And like a mourning woman cried Whose sorrow will not be denied; Then in the sea-caves sank and ceased. The wind came singing from the West And through the formal gardens ranged, And suddenly they all were changed. He entered in the rose's breast, Like any bee, and, murmuring there, Sent a new music through the air: Then, in mid-sweetness, fell to rest. The wind came shouting from the North As some armed warrior might come forth Eager to slay, or to be slain. He tore the last leaves from the tree And sped them shuddering o'er the plain; He called to heel the angry sea, And lashed it with his scourge of rain. The wind came sighing from the South, His hair a cloud, a rose his mouth; His eyes beneath the level brows Were shadowy as forest boughs; His voice was like a song one hears In childhood, lost for many years, Heard first with laughter, last with tears. WIND-SONG Blow, blow, winds blow, braggart winds and merry— Blow down the almond snow, toss the flowering cherry. Daffodils ablow, arow, mingle in their dances; Shake the purple flags that grow tall amid their lances; Blow, O winds blow, strip the winter-berry! Far and near, push and peer; here's a nest a-growing. Winds merry, winds dear, hush here your blowing! Trouble not the mother-wren when she comes and goes, Dreaming of the wings and songs that her secret knows. Soft here, winds dear, where the nests are showing. Blow, blow loud and low, wild winds and merry, Hurtling down upon our heads bring a snow of cherry. Bring the yellow kingcups out in the flowerless places; Set the naked woods aflush with the wind-flowers' faces. Make the old briar run with sap ready for the berry; Bring the swallows, April follows, wild winds and merry. THE WIND AMONG THE REEDS (To Caroline Augusta Hopper) Mavrone, Mavrone! the wind among the reeds. It calls and cries, and will not let me be; And all its cry is of forgotten deeds When men were loved of all the Daoine-sidhe. O Shee that have forgotten how to love, And Shee that have forgotten how to hate, Asleep 'neath quicken boughs that no winds move, Come back to us ere yet it be too late. Pipe to us once again, lest we forget What piping means, till all the Silver Spears Be wild with gusty music, such as met Carolan once, amid the dusty years. Dance in your rings again: the yellow weeds You used to ride so far, mount as of old; Play hide and seek with winds among the reeds, And pay your scores again with fairy gold. THE EAST WIND The white wind of the South it blows from far away, The black wind of the North from the gates of Hell is driven, The gray wind of the West, maybe she blows from Heaven, But the red wind, the East wind's the wind of the judgment day. The white wind and the gray wind they bring the kindly rain, The black wind and the gray wind they carry storm and snow; But when the East wind's blowing, the sleeping dead they know By the breath upon their feet that 'tis time to rise again. No ghost can wake from slumber when the North and West winds blow. The dead lie still and stir not, in their yellowing cerecloths bound; But when the East wind rustles the dead leaves above ground, It is the dead men's holiday, and back to earth they go. They open close-sealed chambers, and they rustle up the stairs; They enter hearts that know them and hearts that have forgot: They leave beside love's rosemary tear-wet forget-me-not, For the East's the wind of memory, and nothing else is theirs. WEED-FIRES Now every little garden holds a haze That tells of longer nights and shorter days: Handfuls of weeds and outcast garden-folk Yield up their lives and pass away in smoke. The leaves of dandelions, deeply notched, Burn with the thistle's purple plumes, unwatched Of any eyes that loved them yesterday, And flare in sullen fumes, and pass away. The small fires whimper softly as they burn; They murmur at the hand that will not turn Back on the dial and bring to them again June's turquoise skies or April's diamond rain. “Alas,” the weeds are crying as they smoulder, “We are grown wiser with our growing older; We know what summer is—but ah! we buy Knowledge too dear; we know because we die.” A DEVONSHIRE SONG Rich is the red earth country, and fair beneath the sun Her orchards in their whiteness show when April waters run; Fair show they in their autumn green when red their apples glow, And yet a lovelier country is that I'm wisht to know. The country has no borders, the country has no name; Its people are as homeless as is a marish-flame; But kind they are and beautiful, and in their golden eyes Their lovers see the gleam that drew out Eve from Paradise. O happy Pixy-people that dance and pass away, That hope not for to-morrow nor grieve for yesterday, O happy Pixy-people, would that I went with you The way the red leaves travel when the harvest moon is new. You fear no blight in summer that kills the growing corn; Your hearts have never sunk to see the sun rise red at morn. The brown spate in the river, the drowned face in the Dart, Have never dimmed a Pixy's eye or hurt a Pixy's heart. But I have seen the river rise and draw my lover down And since the Dart has shrunken too low to let me drown And be at peace beside him, why I would lose this soul That makes the daylight dusk to me, since last Dart took her toll. Oh Pixies, take this heavy soul and make me light as you, I care not though one day I pass away like drying dew— I only care to sleep no more, to dream no more, but go Far from the red earth country and the cruel streams I know. IN KEW GARDENS The lake is blue, the lake is gray. Around the lake tall flag-leaves sway And swither in the gentle wind. The sun is strong enough to blind Weak eyes that love a shaded room. The tulips break in scarlet bloom. Blood-red, wine-red, the peonies stand Like purpled flames on either hand. The peacocks spread their splendid fans And flaunt before the pelicans. Wisht doves in yonder elm-trees try To mock the cuckoo's wandering cry With drawling voices sad and soft, Half lost among the leaves aloft. The white moth with the brown moth flies In shadowy silken companies. Blue into amber fades away; The furthest trees are hazy gray; The purple clouds grow tender green; The rosy clouds mass soft between. The wild-fowl by the water-side Cry as if man's first day had died And Adam, naked, stood alone 'Neath the first darkness he had known. PHÆACIA (To W. H. Chesson) To the Phæacian Islands let us go, Let us link hands and go, And bid farewell to all the jealous Gods While almond-flowers muffle up their rods. The Gods who give Long life to such as have no heart to live And shed swift death upon beloved heads, The Gods who give us amaranth and moly And plant our battle-fields with parsley beds, The Gods who shame the proud and scorn the lowly, This also have they given, A little space wherein dull earth turns heaven; But all the while Fate's wheel, beset with eyes, Turns breaking butterflies. Let us rise up and go To the Phæacian Islands where they lie Gray, 'neath a grayer sky, “At the light's limit,” where the light is low And no winds blow. For here the autumn air is sharp with dreams Of snow to come, And on leaf-muffled roads our feet fall dumb By silent streams. After the summer let us turn and go Beyond the deathly snow, Beyond the breath of any winter wind. The hands that hold us back are all unkind. (Ah, hands unkind That fain would hold us when we fain would go To dimmer, dearer lands than these we know Even as we know the faces of our kin!) The gates of ivory that we would win Stand open and we fain would enter in. To the light's limit where the light is low, Sweet, shall we go? There, neither summer burns, nor winter breathes Death's message to the roses, withering; For the Phæacians know perpetual spring; No tempest ever works their meadows wrong. Their year 's one April, always wavering 'Twixt sun and rain; Harvest is naught to them the whole year long. But always these are theirs, The doubtful pleasure that is half a pain, The ghost of sorrow that is almost fain, So old it is, and Hope that turns again Before she takes farewell Of fields that she has sown with wheat and tares. Here in this drowsy land Joy is not known, and Grief takes Sleep by hand, And by the shadowy streams White poppies nodding grow, fulfilled of dreams. Here in green leaves her light the lily sheathes, And here the rose is always in the bud, The silver brook is never vexed with flood Or thinned with drought in slipping through the dry And sunburnt rushes seaward in July. Let us go hence and find those islands fair, Go hence and take no care For Lydian flutes that falter far away. Let us go hence and take no thought for all The Linus-songs whose long lamentings fall Like rain, like rain round our departing feet. These songs are oversweet And we are weary of the homespun day, And we are sick for shadows: let's away, Link hands and let us go, ere we grow old . . . Your hand is cold; Loose hands and let us go, ere we grow old, To mistier meadows and a softer sky, There in Phæacia to live and die. Nay, but not die, alas! no mortal dies Who eats of lotus 'neath Phæacian skies. Who finds life's tune too long May never break the song Though to each note the sick heart rings untrue. But there grow magic flowers wherewith to twine A garland half divine! Eyebright and bitter rue, Mandragore and moly, Hyacinth sweet as sin and lily holy, Pale iris growing where the stream winds slowly Round the smooth shoulders of untrodden hills, White meadowsweet and yellow daffodils. Shall we go there, dear heart, our lives to crown? For all our garlands here are late leaves brown And bitter rue. Shall we go there and lay our burdens down And drink of youth anew? Shall we go there where no one dreams of death . . . Or love or faith? Shall we go there, or shall we rather stay Here, in the common day, And watch Love's eyes grow dim, Love's head turn gray? We will let be those isles of gramarye And magic flowers let be, To pluck our earthly thyme and columbine And stay where love and death are mine and thine. THE SHORT CUT TO ROSSES By the short cut to Rosses a fairy girl I met; I was taken in her beauty as a fish is in a net. The fern uncurled to look at her, so very fair was she, With her hair as bright as seaweed new-drawn from out the sea. By the short cut to Rosses ('twas on the first of May) I heard the fairies piping, and they piped my heart away; They piped till I was mad with joy, but when I was alone I found my heart was piped away and in my breast a stone. By the short cut to Rosses 't is I'll go never more, Lest I be robbed of soul by her that stole my heart before, Lest she take my soul and crush it like a dead leaf in her hand, For the short cut to Rosses is the way to Fairyland. ON RYE HILL Green meadows after the rainfall look like spring: We pass along them, lazily loitering. White flowers in the deep grass move at the touch of a white moth's wing: The cattle are still in the meadow, and high on the hill The sheep are still. A robin sings in the hawthorn that leans so low, Bowed by the weight of its haws, and the blackberries show Delicate blossom, and fruit that deepens from red Into the perfect black, and the deep-thorned branches spread Traps in the yellowing grass for the careless feet that fare This way in the lover's twilight; and up from the alders there A cloud of swallows rises and dances high in the air. Bells leap up and follow with chime upon chime Us as we climb Up past the alder coolness, the hazel screen. Over us now no trees but the oaks stand green; Beautiful, steadfast, grave, they gather and stand, Guarding the dimpling land; And far away where the girdle of oaks slips free— Behold, the sea. ON THE THAMES EMBANKMENT (LONDON) The bridge's loops were full of stars: Across the bridge there went and came A thousand wandering eyes of flame And then the rattle of the cars. A stain of orange in the smoke Rose and turned brown and passed away. A breath of music tossed like spray Against the river-wall, and broke. A new moon looked through rags of cloud; A pigeon mourned among the trees; And what was yesterday a breeze Made the lamps quiver, and grew loud. Invisible the river was: We heard it, but we could not see. However foul its path may be It might have been through river grass. Of gifts it makes to days and nights I took three memories away: The scent of leaves that rotting lay, The pigeon's call, the wandering lights. WICKLOW HILLS (To W. Y. Fletcher) I heard the noise of fairy pipes complaining all night long What time the skies were empty of cloud and star and song. I heard the noise of fairy pipes complaining far away, High up among the Wicklow Hills till dawning o' the day. Oh, far was I from Wicklow Hills, and yet I saw and knew Beneath the feet of dancers there how shone the druid dew: My feet were moving to the tune that fairy pipers play High up among the Wicklow Hills till dawning o' the day. My dead love danced all night with me among the deathless Shee, And we were young and gay again together, I and he. Though he was dead in Devenish, and I was far away, We danced all night on Wicklow Hills till dawning o' the day. It 's O the kindly hands I grasped, the kindly eyes I knew! It 's O to greet the dancing feet to-night amid the dew! But the pipes are still, and never a hill I see but's far away And I turn my head on a widowed bed, at dawning o' the day. A WHITE NIGHT White stand the houses out in the moonless midnight. Here and there a window lighted yet stands plain, Strange as a lifted eyelid in a face that slumbers. The wakefulness behind it, is it grief or sin or pain? Cart on cart moves stealthily, feet on feet follow; Wheels plod on reluctantly, creaking as they go; A snatch of crazy song beats down a baby's crying; But over all and each the silence falls like snow. All sounds flower slowly from the heart of silence, Not as in the daylight, shrieked at ears a-strain: Harsh sounds come less harshly, and fade before they trouble Ears that hear them come and go, and peace grow whole again. One by one the fixed lights grow paler and grow fewer; One by one man quenches what he lit; the stars remain. The gray sky whitens; with a shudder it is daylight; Cocks are crowing sleep away, and day brings rain. A DAWN Streak upon streak of turquoise in a sheet of heavy gray, A space of shining silver where the clouds are torn away, Stars growing pale in heaven o'erhead, and, lower down, A fringe of amber touches the roofs of the sleeping town. Shadowy wains and waggoners steal slow and softly by; There is no sudden swish of whips, there is no carter's cry. Upon the lips that cease from speech, the lids that fain would rest, A little wind comes whispering out of the lightless west. Lamps in the road are quenched and die because the day's begun, Although there's half an hour to wait ere men salute the sun. Steps of a homeless woman sound hollow down the street; Laugh of a man rings noisily where man and woman meet, And change with languid eyes and lips a fire of idle words. . . A cry of foolish laughter. Then silence; and the birds. A FEBRUARY DAY The birds were crying by the lake That Winter's chain would never break; On brittle ice the seagulls slid, And under leaves and mould was hid The secret that will take the air With sudden sweetness everywhere, Proclaimed by daffodils with might From trumpet-flowers of gold and white. Along the edges of the grass, And in the ruts where cart-wheels pass, A border of unmelted snow Lay, that the Spring herself might know 'Twas not yet time for her to keep Tryst with the blossoms still asleep, To wake the squirrel in his hole, From chrysalid to call the soul. Tall rods of winter jasmine stood Naked of leaves, but glad of mood, Covered with golden flowers for sign That Spring would come, and cowslips shine In those brown spaces 'neath the trees Where only last year's leaves one sees Heaped sadly as the last wind drave Them to and fro the lily's grave. A robin on a holly-bough Sang as if pairing-time were now And not a wintry week away: The brightest colour of the day Was on his orange-feathered breast. The silent starlings stepped in quest Of food, where new-cut sods were turned. High overhead a pale sun burned. A JUNE NIGHT The moon is a vampire to-night. She has sucked from the stars Their splendour of silver: they lean to us weary and white Like prisoners' faces pressed pale against window bars, And the wind is full of whispering dust to-night. The roads are spread thickly with velvet that no one may hear Coming or going of June: shattered topaz and pearl Of the chestnuts are shed underfoot, and disappear In dust that follows men's feet and the wheels that whirl. There's a ghost by the hedge that by day is a blossoming elder: A dusty and breathless scent is blown down to me Out of the laurustinus. The sun-smitten guelder Drops her last snowball, and droops as a barren tree. A THUNDERSTORM The sea is full, and over-full; The waves are edged with foam like wool: Does Proteus shear his flocks to-night? It seems so thick with fleeces white. The sky is like a copper shield, Brought broken from a battle-field; Between its rents the lightnings leap, Tryst with the meeting clouds to keep. The wind cries like a child to-night: Its breath has turned the poplars white; The ivy shudders on the wall, And petals of red lilies fall. A moment, and the world is dumb: The moment ere the thunders come. The earth holds breath 'twixt fear and pain, Then, childlike, floods her fear with rain. GRAY SAILS (To John Lane) What do you look for, 'twixt dusk and gloaming, White sails going or gray sails homing? Sunset turns white sails red in the bay; Gloaming finds not the sails of gray. Patched and rotten the gray sails were; White sails gleam in the sunset air. Under the white sails hearts are gay; Sorrow sailed with the sails of gray— Sorrow for pilot and Skipper Sin. What if the gray sails never came in? Peril of ship and soul might be. What if they sailed to a quiet sea, Safe from danger of rock and blast, Where sails of gray might be furled at last? The red wind out of the East blows on O'er white sails going and gray sails gone. Somewhere or other the red wind sees Quiet harbours where ride at ease Ships that were stormbound far away, Ships with white sails and ships with gray. Hush your keen in the windy gloaming, In that good harbour gray sails are homing. A LITTLE CREED Life is a scroll whereon the soul must write Its tale of peace or sorrow or delight. No man may leave it white, But write true words thereon, though these were only “I lived,” “I loved,” “I hoped,” or “I was lonely.” The one false word of life is Ichabod. The glory is not departed: They lie who say it, being heavy-hearted. The glory was here; the glory is hid with God. All glories that we lose, or we forego, Some day shall find us, this I surely know. All lost and lovely things of long ago, Whose living fire grew cold Upon the altars that we built of old, Shall come and warm again The gray and empty places of our pain, Visible gods and fair Breathing immortal promise in the air That, being past sunset, lets all colours go, Gladness and sadness that we put away, And every dim belief of yesterday For which we do not pray, Grown old and cold and tired with long desire, Grown stiff with kneeling in a winter's night In the ghost-ridden place of old delight, Blowing the ashes gray Of youth's extinguished fire, Grace that we dare not hope for, Good that we blindly grope for— A sweet and piteous host Of lovelinesses lost. When we are tired of seeking, and are still, Broken, not in desire, but in our will, Our heart's desire shall come to us, and kiss The lips that lost their colour, seeking this. SOONTREE (A Lullaby) My joy and my grief, go sleep and gather Dreams from the tree where the dreams hang low Rounder than apples, and sweeter than honey, All to delight you, ma creevin cno! My joy, fill your dear hands full of roses, And gather lilies that stand a-row: Pull rush and reed with the Shee's fair children, But eat not, drink not, ma creevin cno! You may not taste of the cups of honey, You may not taste of the wine blood-red. Of the mead and the wine he drank, your father, And the next night's rain wept your father, dead. Reach up to the star that hangs the lowest, Tread down the drift of the apple-blow, Ride your ragweed horse to the Isle of Nobles; But the Shee's wine drink not, ma creevin cno! Shoheen, shoheen, shoheen, sho! AN IRISH LULLABY Husho, husho, winds are wild in the willows, Birds are warm in downy nests, every bird but you. King's children wake and toss on silken pillows. You have but a broken roof to keep you from the dew. Husho! Husho, husho, rain falls cold in the city, Here rain falls kindly, falls warm on sleepy eyes. Husho, husho! even the clouds take pity On my vourneen deelish O and leave you silver skies. Husho! Husho, husho, silver skies to sail in, In a boat of amber, warm as any nest: Ah, but can my cushla find no place to wail in But the warmest place on earth, and that her mother's breast? Husho!</field>
