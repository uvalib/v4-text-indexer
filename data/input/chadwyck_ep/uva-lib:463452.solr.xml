      <field name="fulltext">THE BEGGERS APE. About that Moneth whose name at first begun From great Avgvstvs, that Romes Empire wonne: Wh? the fierce Dog of Heauen, begun to rise To baite the Lyon in th'Olympian skies. Whose hot fire-breathing influence did cracke With too much heate our aged Grandames backe, Lapping vp Riuers with his blaring tongue T'allay the thirst which his proud stomacke stung. Then did each Creature languish pant and beate Vnder the influence of this horrid heate, And I that oft in my low seated Cell Had felt the burning of his fury fell: Vpon a time Aurora shining faire Went forth to take the solace of the ayre. And in those Meades beyond the lofty Towers Of that white Pallace, where the nightly houres Haue oft bin spent in sounds of Musicke sweet And actiue motion of the nimble feet: Where earthly sonnes by night were seene to moue, Whilest many hearts were fir'd with flames of Loue. There I made choyse to walke before the Sunne Had shewne his face, within our Horizon; But on those bankes by which each turning tide Thames louely Isis with calme streames doth glide, I had not walked long ere Dayes bright King T'Olympus top his golden Carre did bring: Whose Steedes with sting of his free lashes driuen With such swift speed did gallop through the heauen, That Natures faire productions heere beneath Did seeme to melt vnder their burning breath, The wing'd inhabitants both of earth and skie That too and fro in th'open ayre did flie To Thickets, Woods, and Groues, swift concourse made To shroud themselues vnder their leauie shade, The bleating Lambe and little wandring Sheepe That in the open fields before did keepe, Forsaking their free laire, all flocking came To seeke for shelter 'gainst Sol's burning flame. And I 'mongst the rest compeld by heate Which on my head did violently beat To seeke some couert shade straight tooke my way Vnto a Groue which neere confining lay. Where when I came the lofty trees, I clad In Summers pride did cast a cooling shade, Vnder whose leaues from PhÅbus burning rayes Sweet birds sate singing their Melodious layes, There sate I downe vpon the grassy ground Amid'st those silent shades encompast round By leauy trees that Arbour wise did spread There goodly armes thicke brauncht aboue my head, But as I there my selfe did closely shroud The chearefull voyce of many laughing loude All suddainely did penetrate myne eare Which did apall my sence with suddaine feare And casting round about my rowling eye Without the wood I chanced to espie A ragged crue of folke all set around About a sunny bancke vpon the ground They all were clad in rags of Beggery Taking no karpe of any faculty Or honest calling to rely vpon, For trade or true profession had they none; And now to passe the tedious time away With pleasant tales as in the Sunne they lay Each one in course the other did succeed Which much content 'mongst themselues did breed And I to be partaker of their mirth Being closely hidden with a hill of earth Vnheard or seene conuey'd my selfe so neare That all their chat I vn-espied did heare; Some told of battailes and of bloody fights, And some of Ladies and of loues delights And some of dire euents and Tragicall And some of Iests and loues sports Comicall: But 'mongst the rout one well I wot there was That all the rest in fluent speech did passe Who with good vtterance that became him well A pretty story of an Ape did tell. All which for that it seemeth vnto mee Worthy their view whose thoughts delighted bee In morrall discipline I will vnfold it And in those tearmes in which the Begger told it. Not many yeares (quoth he) are past and gone Since heauens faire Virgin in her siluer throne From forth her lap such golden blessings threw As if th'old Age againe shee would renew, And at that time the vast worlds Forrest wide Deckt in the Summers coate of Ãstas pride Did flourish and growe proude in lusty prime Beneath the Sunne-shine of sweet summers time There many Iouiall trees shoot vp on high With threatning heads did seeme to vaile the skie Beneath the shade of whose protecting armes The Birds sate singing free from fearefull harmes, The Beasts likewise might all securely goe About the Forrest roaming too and fro, For with the Eagle that skie climing bird And his consorts they late had made accord, And vnto peacefull state all things to bring As meete it was they made the Lyon King; And at that season many beasts found grace That liu'd obscure before and in meane place. 'Mongst whome a beast that was of Secrops brood Whome of a man Ioue in his irefull moode, Detesting his deceitfull guile did make So foule a beast that no man could him take T'haue bin a man, yet was it with such skill That being a beast a man he fauoured still. His limbes in lesser space then mans are knit Beneath his Eyes his Nose more flat doth sit And like the face which crabbed age doth spill Deepe wrinkles frowne-like his front did fill; There to his Apish limbs are euery where Thicke ouer-growne with sallow coloured haire, And him in land of Apes Ile, Ioue did place There to abide and neuer show his face Amongst vs men, where hee not long did stay Ere 'mongst the beasts lewd prankes hee gan to play; For in the golden Age the worlds first spring Euen in the pallace of the Forrests King, His witty wiles he oft in practise put Them to deceiue, for which his taile was cut; Exiling him for euermore from thence To the Ape Jle againe for his offence. But he that long time there liu'd all a mort His taile being cut, for comming to the Court Of better fortunes now gan cogitate And forth he comes to mend his meane estate, His way vnto the Forrest straight he takes And in his iourney this obseruance makes Who liu'd disgracefull, who in fauour were And 'bout the Lyon who cheife Place did beare; The golden fleeced Sheepe he first did spie Patterne of patience, and simplicitie Grasing obscurely 'mongst the meaner sort As being a stranger in the Lyons Court; âFor who so beares simplicities true badge âTo liue in Princes Courts doe seldome fadge. And though the silly Sheepe contented were For that plaine honest life, which he did beare Yet for his golden Fleece against his will Hee was acquainted with the Courtiers still. Fast by the Sheepe the humble Oxe did graise Who for he sought not his estate to raise, Was held in base contempt for his meeke minde âMeekenesse in Greatnesse we so seldome finde. The Ape being glad to see the Sheepes bad case And plaine simplicity in such disgrace Thought with himselfe as true it was indeed That wily wit would stand him in best steed, And on his way he forth gan wend a pace Hoping at Court to finde such future grace; That in the end he doubted not to bring Himselfe in fauour with the Forrest King. Where when he came himselfe he did apply T'obserue all fashions with an heedfull eye, The first on whome he any notice tooke Was that high horned beast who in his looke Beares signes apparant of his secret minde To wit the Goat, a louer borne by kinde For he the habit had of all cheife sleights In wanton loues and Ladies Court delights. On which most Gallants now their wits doe proue To serue their Ladies and their Lemmons loue. But he surpast them all for he could sing In chaunting songs, and on the warbling string Of Vyoll sweet thereto diuinely played The sound of which would charme the chaistest Maide, For which he was of Females so approu'd That they 'boue all the rest him chiefely lou'd; Yet he with whally eyes and shaggy beard And welked hornes so Satir-like appeard That such a grim fac't fellow would affright A lewd Faustinaes selfe in darkest night, Thereto his body did so ranckly smell That he himselfe might not abide it well; But he that fault did hide with pleasing sent Of sweet perfume when ere abroad he went, The Ape him oft beheld in passing by And in his seruice would his fortune try By meanes made by the Monkey, his neere friend Who on the Goate chiefe seruant did attend. But loe not long hee stood thus all a mort, Ere hee beheld at entring of the Court A troupe of Gallants, rushing in the way All proudly clad in strange and rich aray, With wide-big-bason lookes they all did gape In passing by vpon the silly Ape. For mickle pride (sull well I wot) they tooke To daunt a stranger with a scornefull looke; Thereto, from fullest mouthes they tooke delight With horrid Oathes, the golden Starres to smite, Ne gaue they due regard, or Reuerend loue Vnto the King of Gods the thundring Joue, But all their PÃ¦ans consecrated bee To drunken Bacchus on low bended knee. The chiefe 'mongst these that bare supreamest sway Was the fell Bore, who with the least delay Euen for a looke misdeem'd, would hazard life In any furious broyle or bloody strife, With him came many Beasts that did delight In sternefull rage, debate, and bloody fight: And therefore loued euer for to bee Together with the Bore in company. There came the Tyger, who withouten dread Was into any danger headlong lead. The wrathfull Beare, whom in his fiery rage Nought else but blood and vengeance might asswage, The Bull and Ram, who both couragious were But wanted wit in fury to forbeare. Amidst this Crew a simple beast there was To Court being newly come, to wit, the Asse, Whom they with fawning speech and threats withall So wrought vnto their will, that at their call They had both him and his, and sooth to say Inricht with golden store, hee was fit pray For such in Court whose credit waxed bare, So witlesse was hee and so voyd of care; For he of late had left his Countrey home His Sire being dead, and now to Court was come, Where all a flaunt, hee ryots and consumes In gold, in siluer, silke and sweet perfumes His old Sires, ill-got-goods now goes to wracke, Farmes, Forrests, Fields, hee beares vpon his backe, And neuer deemes what Fate will him betide When all is spent by his vnseemely pride. The Ape that had obseru'd with heedfull eye The stout demeanour of this Company, Tooke little liking to this kind of life, For hee ne loued for to bee in strife; Ne fauour would hee with such perill winne, âBut thought best sleeping in the soundest skinne. Long did hee lurke about the Court in vayne, Before his close intent hee could obtayne: âBut hee that doth his Fate with heed attend, âSeldome but findes good Fortune in the end. And at the last good Fortune being his guide, An old acquaintance he in Court espide; To wit, the Fox, who found in Court such grace That he about the King had gotten place. For the Dread Lyon loathing Luxurie âThe Canker-worme of true Nobilitie, T'allay the pride that in the flesh beares sway And banish loathsome Idlenesse away: To spend his golden houres did still deuise In Kingly pastime and faire exercise, There to rich guifts, Prince-like he gaue to those, That did themselues to exercise dispose; Thereby to purge his Court to ease inclin'd, And base sloath banish from the Noble mind. In which the Fox, his Soueraigne did so please, Seeming the common Enemie of ease: That hee himselfe in mickle grace did bring With the bold Lyon, his dread Lord and King. But hee foule Carle (not as his King) did make This vse of exercise for vertues sake, But gaue himselfe thereto with this intent To creepe in fauour with foule blandishment To him the Ape in humble manner came To scrape acquaintance and make knowne his name; But the proud Fox, though him hee well did know, Like a true Courtier gan himselfe to show With Elboe pride, and cast of scornfull eye Hee stoutly stalk't vpon his tiptoes high Disdaining to th'Apes words to lend his eare Though hee of yore his old acquaintance were. And in such proud contempt he passed by, That the Apes former hopes began to dye; Being in despaire his meane estate to mend Forsaken thus of his old fellow friend. But the slye Fox aduising all this while How the Ape being wittie, prompt, and full of guile, âAnd that two working wits will soone preuaile âIn any plot when one may chance to faile; Straight sends vnto the Ape and greets him well, Bidding him come to him his case to tell. The forlorne Ape being almost in despaire With double diligence did make repaire Vnto the Fox, to whom obeysance made These famous words in humble wise hee said. All haile (graue Sir) quoth hee, good fates attend Your steps in Court, still Fortune be your freind And in sweet showers, th'auspicious heau'ns down-shed Their bounteous blessings on your reuerent head. The Fox him thanking, answered in this sort, But say (Sir Ape) what wind brings you to Court? Seemes you haue liued in some barren place And want lifes needements for to doe you grace; For you be growne so meager leane and wan, That scarce your legs your limbs vpholden can. For which, I weene, you want that wonted wit And iudgement sharpe, that seem'd of yore to sit In th'ilke same head, by which you could at need Both helpe your selfe and stand your freind in steed. Ah mee (Sir Reynald) sayd the wretched Ape Of all the Forrest hardest is my hap That I vnhappy wretch, thus as you see Am made the scorne of other beasts to bee; Yet ne'rthelesse Sir, if of your grace you please You of your bounty may my fortunes ease, And set my wit in the old working way âWant of imployment makes best wits decay. Now certes (said the Fox) yee say right well, âFor custome doth in power so excell; âThat vertues selfe in the most liberall minde âFor want of it oft times decay'd we find âAnd vse being common made in vsefull things âVice to inseperable habit brings. Then pitty t'were, so ripe a wit you haue The want of good imploiment should deprane. Read then, Sir Ape, what course you doe intend And if in it my helpe may you befriend: Doubt not to find for old acquaintance sake My furtherance in any course you take. To this the Ape, deepe sighing, thus did say Ah (noble Sir) y blessed be this day, That with such hap good fortune did me greet As with your selfe so happily to meet; For well I weene, I onely hope to rise By sage instruction of your sound deuise. Then read (faire Sir) of fauour I you pray What custome in the Court now beares cheife sway To what thing most is that Heroicke mind Of our dread Soueraigne chiefely now enclind, âFor well I wot the subiect that will bring âHimselfe in fauour with his Lord and King, âWhat his Lord likes at least must seeme to loue âAnd of his fancy must alwayes approue. Surely, said Reynald, this which you haue spoken Of your graue iudgement giues sufficient token, And know, that now the Lyons chiefe delight Is to behold those that in nimble fight, Can best pursue the wilder beasts in chase And such as they be now in speciall grace; For he with idle ease may not away The obstacle to vertues best assay. And therefore least good dayes may be mispent To noble exercise he still is bent: Ne doe I doubt but you by pregnant wit To any exercise your selfe can fit, And though of footmanship you be not slow Yet none amongst the best of beasts I know In all the woods with you compar'd may bee For nimblenes and swift Agility. By which you may in frowning Fates despight Purchase you fauor in your Soueraignes sight. Ah (deere Sir) said the Ape, yblessed be Your life with length of dayes for Charitie To me poore wretch. But say Sir, I you pray By what step shall I make my best assay To gaine the Forests King vnto my friend âA good beginning makes a happy end. To this the Fox replyed, Sir Ape, said hee Well haue you said, yet that my busines bee Meane while your wits for my imployment frame For in the Forrest wee will find good game. âLet Drudges by base toile there liuing get âThe generous borne will onely liue by wit; This said, the subtle Fox in secret wise The Ape gan counsell with such sound aduise That in short space in Court he got much grace When those of more desert could find no place. âFor few there be, that for good guifts of mind âOr vertues bare regard doe fauour find âOnely they rise that can by guilefull wit âSerue their owne turne with gainefull benefit, âThe honest mind from thence is made to flye âWhen shamelesse ribaulds are aduanced high âThe simple-hearted are accounted base, âWhen bold and impudent are most in grace, âVaine boasting Thrasoes, soothing Flatterers, âSly cogging Gnatoes, secret whisperers, âTale-bearing Fleerers, and false accusing lackes, âThere beare best shewes vpon their golden backes. 'Mongst whom the Ape did beare himselfe so well That hee in rich attire did farre excell; And eke his sides with flesh so filled were, That not a bone did any where appeare. Ne, few him knew that knew him well before T'haue bin the wretched Ape he was of yore, For neuer more did Proteus change his shape; For to deceiue, then did this wilie Ape At first with lowly lookes and humble minde, Himselfe in great States fauour he did winde, With Sycophantlike trickes, hee tooke delight, With euery Iacke to play the Parasite, To sooth, to cogge, to fawne, to lye, to sweare, To crouch, to glose, and patiently to beare All grosse abuse, to take vp euery word Falne from the lying lippes of some great Lord: To laugh, looke sad, to like and dislike both, To say and vnsay, sweare and forsweare troth. But when by humble seruice and long suite In Court hee came to bee of some repute, Hee many subtle sleights did quickly find T'exhalt himselfe when others came behind: Then waxt hee proud, and bent his guilefull wit To turne all things to his owne benefit; False of his faith, yet prodigall in word, Darke in his talke, yet seldome would afford Poore Suitors hearing; but vnlesse they came With golden warrants signed for the same: Yet if that Suitors meanes for suites would vse, Whom better, then Sir Ape, could any chuse; For many a Canker-worme of common state Some farming Huckster, or Sea runagate, T'increase their priuate good by publique ill, Might through his helpe with ease obtaine their will. Thus the slye Ape with naturall wit endow'd, Grew great in wealth, by wealth grew wondrous proud. âFor costly wealth euen to the basest wight âGiues golden wings to soare a lofty flight. Now while the Ape did study more and more By daily begging to increase his store, The Fox that idle was, but by his wit For the Apes turne still layd foundation fit, And on a time I weene, aboue the rest, To th'Ape hee commeth with a merry Iest. (Sir Ape) quoth hee, if you my friend will stand, Wee will not want t'haue gold at our command; For I in Court haue found a gallant gull Whom of his gold, (of which hee yet is full) We well may fleece, if you will lend your ayde To which in hast, the Ape this answer made. Say in good sooth, Sir Reynald, I you pray, In what my word and deed you helpen may And of what Mister wight make you report I know him not? spends he his dayes in Court? Yes, quoth the Fox, to Court he came of late And well I wot hee is a Iolly mate; It is to wit, the Asse, whose aged syre Did toyle himselfe and drudge for daily hyre And left his thrifty gaine vnto his sonne To gentilize it here when he was gone. Sayd then the Ape, foule shame such fooles betide That to maintayne their sonnes vnthrifty pride Will bow their labouring backes and take no pleasure For all their paines vpon their hardrackt treasure. The Fox reply'd, you seeme to bee a Foe To gentle kinde; for if it were not so, How should the Forrest in a moment space, Breed so much gentle-blood of meaner race, And sooth to say, this Asse though meanely borne Yet through much wealth, made wondrous full of scorn. An humour strange in his conceit doth feed That by discent hee comes of Noble breed. It was my chance the other day to be With th'horned Goate, and him in company, Who both were clad in goodly rich array: But in attire, the Asse was farre more gay. His head with plume of Feathers was bedight, His trappings all with Bells and Bosses bright Was richly furnished, which with more pride Hung downe vnto the ground on eyther side. These lustie Gallants to increase their fame, In their conceits at Knighthood both doth ayme. Which if for them wee can by friends obtayne, Wee shall not fayle for meed t'haue double gayne; For the Asse so vaine appeares, that he will giue His whole estate, ere he vnknighted liue. And for the Goate, we shall haue golden fee Of Female kind, that they may Ladyed bee. Being dub'd by him; Say then (Sir Ape) I pray Good gaine is oft times lost by long delay. Sir Reynald, said the Ape, my forward mind Brookes no delay, where I a meane may find To worke my will: but know that your intent Makes me much doubt, the sequell of th'euent: For this high Order is to those assign'd, That famous be for vertue of the mind, Or for some high atchiuement; for their meed Haue purchas'd it, to glorifie their deed. How may we then bring such a thing to passe, As purchase Knighthood for the golden Asse. Tush, quoth the Fox, the world now doth not see The thing that is, but that which seemes to bee. And hee whose tongue the tayle of Greatnesse lickes If he will thriue, his Conscience neuer stickes To ouergild, and lift vp to the skies With deepest oathes, inuentions blackest lyes; And that we may our purpose bring to passe, We must obscure the folly of the Asse. The vertues rare that beautifie his mind, Wee must applaud, thereby the world to blind; And say and sweare, that hee amongst the best Of all the Forrest is the hopeful'st beast; So to the world they both shall seeme to bee For vertues sake, much worthy this degree. Now certes, said the Ape, this is good leasing And to the Lyon it will sure bee pleasing: When in the Forrest hee shall heare the fame, Which in their high applause wee can proclaime. Meane time, Sir Reynald, backe returne with speed Vnto them both, and tell them 'tis decreed, That worthy they shall weare the golden Spurre Like two true sonnes of Mars, and ne're incurre The hazard of the Field, but onely this, To haue our fee before, we may not misse. Tush, quoth the Fox, bee confident in mee, A foole hee is that will behind hand bee: If that our purpose haue but good euent The gaine is ours, neere thinke your paines mispent. This said, themselues they both began t'apply T'effect their purpose, all their friends they try; And such applauses daily they impute To the Asse and Goat, for whom they make this suite That in the end both twaine in pompe and pride Were dubd Knights errand, of the Forrest wide Of whom in guerdon of their mickle paines The begging Ape and Fox had golden gaines, So both thinke well themselues apayd to bee They with their Knighthood, th'other with their Fee. But let not such base Lossels that account All merit vayne, and onely hope to mount Themselues with golden wings to such degree That seeke to purchase it with baser Fee; And thinke a siluer silken vestiment A gilded Spurre, or strange acoutrement The fruits of brainsicke fancies fond delight The onely meanes to make a perfect Knight. Let not such dunghil brood of Kestrill kinde That vnto honour neuer cast their minde Dismay the noble spirit that assayes Through deeds of Armes his name on high to raise; For bare degrees that want true vertues merit Shall in fames golden booke no place inherit. When Honour, Meede, and noble vertues praise In Swan-white age findes fresh and youthfull dayes; Then let not fond Sir Asse, disgracefull seeme To those that for their worth and high esteeme In vertues bare regard exalted bee By Princes grace to place of such degree; Let boasting Bragadochioes of our time And golden-handed Churles, that seeke to clime To places of such high credit, inly burne And with the vaine Sir Asse, the Begger spurne; So shall the Ape their follies still deride And fleece their store for their aspiring pride. Who tasting once the sweet delights that came By this his Begging trade, himselfe did frame With golden fees of dayly Begging base, Shamelight on gaine got with so foule disgrace; Yet shamelesse hee continued begging still To glut the gulfe of his vnsatiate will. Which many noble beasts did soone espie On whome the Lyons safetie did relye, To whose great wisdome and fore-casting cares Committed were the Forrests cheife Affaires. But 'mongst them all, that most illustrate beast That worthy Counsellor from heau'n yblest, The noble Elephant tooke speciall heed That out of Court such Beggers he might weed. And sooth to say, as Greekes doe well recite With crooked Trumpet he could truely write, And by the working of his prudent mind Could oft obscure the wits of humaine kind; For on his care the Kingdomes happines Did most depend, and for her worthines To him committed was in custodie The keeping of the common Treasurie. This worthy Peere, who dayly did behold The shamelesse begging of these Beggers bold In wisedome diuers wayes did cast about To finde the wily Apes soule knauery out. But th'Ape so well him bore that long it was E're th'Elephant could bring his will to passe; Meane time like as the Leach vpon the store From greedy sucking ne're desists, before The place be bloodlesse left exhausted dry So did th'Ape to th'Asse himselfe apply. For when the doultish beast ycleped was Through all the Court (by name of hight Sir Asse) Puft vppe with pride, he thought himselfe to bee The fairest beast that euer eye did see, Hee learned had to praunce with stately pace To rayne his Asses head with lofty grace And in each point himselfe so high to beare As if that hee some noble Palfray were; Which pride of his, was laughed so to scorne Of euery beast that knew him to bee borne Of base descent, yet hee through want of wit Swolne proud by wealth, such folly did commit, That he their common Gull accounted was And bore the title of the golden Asse. Which th'Ape did well perceiue, &amp; with vaine showes Of fained friendship gan with him to glose, With soothing tongue his folly he did feed And gaue him counsell by some glorious deed To amplify his name in euery place, Hee knew he was not come of Asses race; But racher sprung of some such noble breed As swift wing'd Pegasus that heau'nly Steed. Hee wisht him therefore in a single race To chalenge th'Horse, thereby to get him grace Ne did he doubt but he should win the day If hee with courage bold but gaue th'Assay. Sir Asse, with selfe conceit being mou'd in minde To heare his praise, forgot himselfe by kinde T'haue bin an Asse, and in this humour sent A chalenge to the Horse with this intent, To runne with him before the Forrest King In hope himselfe in fauour for to bring. The day was set and chosen was the place Vpon the open Plaine to runne this race; Where the dread King of beasts stood to behold The stout Sir Asse, performe his chalenge bold; The time being come forth came the lustie Horse With comely grace to runne th'expected course, Who by his stately gesture gan to show Stout signes in proud contempt of his base foe. His crested necke hee often bow'd to ground With foaming mouth as if he would confound The earth at once, and from his nosthrils came A fierie breath as from a furnace flame; His pricking Eares stood startling on his head And of a common custome inlye bred, In iollity of pride which did abound, His hollow hoofe still played vpon the ground; At last from his strong necke in neighing shrill With sound thereof the Forrest hee did fill, Seeming thereby to call vpon Sir Asse, That in this challenge the appellant was. Who vainely vaunting with a gallant trayne Came proudly prauncing on the ample Plaine; Where when hee came beholding well the Horse His comely grace, braue shape, and wondrous force: Halfe in despaire hee did himselfe repent Of his proud challenge and bold hardiment. Yet with the vayne applause of flattering mates Being proudly prickt, with Courage bold he waites, The time appointed to begin the race Before the Forrest King being then in place; The signe once giuen, Sir Asse, began to runne With greedy hope great fame thereby t'haue wonne. But the braue Horse in pace away did goe Like winged shaft shot from a Tuscan bowe, Or like a Swallow in the welkin bright That sheeres the subtle ayre with nimble flight, Leauing the sluggish Asse with shame behind To know himselfe to be an Asse by kind. With mickle laughter bred in euery place Amongst the beasts that stood to see the race, Which the Ape did well obserue with slye intent As he that knew, what would be the euent; For when the Asse, amongst the better sort Was held in base contempt throughout the Court, And left forlorne for his stupidity The Ape alone, did keepe him company. Whose doltish nature by his cunning wit In all his actions done he did so fit, That in the end by craft and cousening slye Hee gull'd the simple beast and suckt him dry. Who left forlorne returned all a mort Vnto his Country home, from Princes Court. There helpelesse to bewaile in wofull wise His lauish will and wanton riotize; O wretched end of idle vanity, Of misexpence and Prodigality. You younger wits that spend your golden houres, Your selues and substance in great Princes bowers; That quaffe downe Court delights, and dayly swill The seeming sugred Nectar of your ill; That weare your large left patrimonies bare In Drinke, in Dice, Dauncing and dainty fate. That vp and downe in Antick shapes doe jet, And on your golden backs doe beare your debt, And with a vaine bewitching hope struck blind Of idle fame doe watch to catch the wind, Yet thinke your selues all others to surpasse In reaching wit. Behold this forlorne Asse, Who 'mongst the best, once iolly blithe and trim In deepest waues of sweet delight did swim; Now of his golden good he being bereft And driuen home, when scarce no home was left: In stead of stately bower, where he had bin An homely Cottage gladly enters in. Where with sad sighes his wretched eyes doe fill In stead of Arras and sweet paintings skill, Vpon the broken roofe and slender walls Sticks smoakie black and Spiders dusty coales, In stead of sweet perfumes, the bitter smoake With foggy clouds his tender sight doth choake, In stead of Siluer plate, or purest Glasse Hee with the Beggers dish now pleased was, In which for Wine to glad his wofull hart Hee takes cold Whey and water in good part, His Courtly dyet fraught with many a dish Of diuers kindes of dainty Flesh and Fish, Is now become the almes of some good house Or homely morsell of some hungry Mouse. The ground his board, greene grasse his Carpet makes And for his Bed a pad of Straw he takes In which distresse, by his owne folly bred Hee weeps, he sighes, and shakes his wofull head; Blaming his bitter Fate, but all in vaine Since of his wealthy store naught doth remaine. Meane time the Ape that liu'd vpon his losse Seeing the wretched fortune of the Asse, Did laugh to scorne his wofull misery And pitch'd his nets with fraud and subtilty; To circumvent the weake and simple sort That vsed to frequent the Princes Court. But thus while th'Ape such things to passe did bring About the pallace of the Forrest King The greedy Wolfe his part did also play In woods abroad t'obtaine his wished pray, Who was a bloudy beast of wicked brood And sought to liue by spoyle of others good. Yet had hee large possessions of his owne, And in the woods was mighty wealthy growne, Whereby he daily sought in Cruell wise Vpon the poorer Beasts to Tyrannize, The Woods in Common, and th'adioyning Plaine Hee did conuert vnto his priuate gaine; And meaner beasts that nigh his Den did dwell, Hee from their owne abodes did oft expell. 'Mongst whom the Urchin and the Squirrill hight, By the Apes helpe, he robbed of their right: For in close thicket farre from sight of Sunne Where in his darksome Den the Wolfe did wonne, The industrious Urchin in his little Cell, Not farre from thence alone did chance to dwell. At whose good hap the Wolfe did much repine And daily did behold with enuious eyne, How he in sharpest Winter did enioy The fruites of Sommers toyle without annoy; For when Pomona did in winters scorne The Woods greene heads with golden fruit adorne, When fields doe seem to laugh, when flowers doe spring When Beasts doe play, and Birds doe sweetly sing; Then would the Urchin watch with curious eye, When Boreas blasts did cuffe the Clouds in skye And shake the Tree when like thicke showers of raine The Fruit would fall, the which with mickle paine Vpon his brisled backe, the Vrchin bore Home to his Cell to make his winters store, Whereby from winters thrall hee liu'd secure, When other Beasts much sorrow did endure. Now at the entry of the sterne Wolfes denne The place of his abode had long time bin; That 'gainst the State nought could be done or sayd, But by the Vrchin it might bee bewrayed. The Wolfe likewise out of his greedy moode Did seeke t'inlarge the place of his abode, By proud incroaching of that little Cell In which his neighbour, th'Vrchin vs'd to dwell; Wherefore hee sought by death or some disgrace, To dispossesse the Urchin of that place. And on a time from home as th'Vrchin went Abroad into the Forrest with intent As was his wont, to get such labours meed, As Fortune in the Forrest had decreed. Loe in the way the tauening Wolfe did watch This silly beast within his pawes to catch, Whom he did often thinke to make his prey, Yet durst hee not at that time giue th'Assay, So well the Vrchin did his body arme With coate of proofe, 'gainst all intended harme. The Wolfe therefore perceiuing force to faile Did seeke by flattering falshood to preuaile. For in the way finding occasion meet With fawning words, thus th'Urchin hee did greet. Now neighbour, quoth the Wolfe, you be well met Vpon what high atchieuement be you set, That you thus armed bee, seemes you doe stand In dangers doubt, and feare some harme at hand. Nay certes, quoth the Vrchin, nought I feare Of harme t'ensue, this armed coate I weare For no such cause; but that with paine I may Vpon my brisled hide, such fruit conuay To my poore home, which in the woods I find, Least with the sluggard vnto ease inclin'd, On Summers pleasure I doe fondly feed, And want in Winter to sustaine my need. The Wolfe replyed, y blessed be thy paine And labour, that deserues to reape good gaine; Yet let me now disswade thee to disarme Thy selfe this once, and feare no future harme, This day desist from toyle and goe with mee Vnto our friend, where wee will welcome bee; For to all Beasts, this day is by the Bore Kept festiuall, where we shall finde good store Of diuers dainty Fruits, of which at will Withouten labour thou mayest haue thy fill. This sayd, he vsed such kinde courtesie Mix'd with such friendly Importunitie; That the poore Vrchin, thought his meaning good And would with him vnto the neighbouring Wood, Whereas the Bore should wonne; but loe at need A friend was by, to helpe him at that steed. And sure the silly Vrchin that same day Vnto the Rauening Wolfe had beene a prey, But that the Squirrill from the leauie Tree, Vnseene to them the Wolfes intent did see; Who to the Vrchin, call'd with loude exclaime; Fond foole said hee, what madnes is this same? How darest thou credit that same cruell Beast, That on thy Carkasse seekes to make his Feast. Take heed, by his seducements bee not led, If thou disarme thy selfe thou art but dead. For hence I did behold how in the way In secret couert hid, hee lurking lay, And hadst thou not with stiffe quill'd pointed hide Beene arm'd about; by him thou sure hadst dy'd. The Vrchin hearing this, vpon his chin Did set his feet and drew his brisled skin About his body round, as any ball To shield himselfe, and shun his fatall fall. Which when the Wolfe perceiu'd, hee went his way Inrag'd in minde, and vow'd without delay To act a swift reuenge vpon them both, And for his cause, vnto the Ape he goeth; To whom, Complaint against them he doth bring To be preferr'd vnto the Forrests King. Hee told, how th'Vrchin like a theeuish wight Did steale abroad in dead of darksome night, Vsing to sucke the full-fed Kine vnkept, While the poore Neatheard all securely slept: And how the Squirrill to augment his store, Did rob the Forrest of the Fruit it bore; And to his will, that he might better shape The greedy fancy of the Begging Ape, Hee wish'd him begge the forfeit of their Goods, Since none amongst the Beasts about the woods There was, with whom such treasure could be found As with them twaine which chiefly did abound With Nuts, and Aples, which the Wolfe could tell Aboue all things, the Ape lou'd wondrous well. And sooth to say these tidings did so please Th'Apes greedy humor, that with little ease The Wolfe obtain'd his wish for in small space The Urchin and the Squirrill wanting grace Of friends to backe their cause were from those Woods Exil'd for aye, and forfeited there goods; Whereby the Wolfe possession did obtaine Of th'Vrchins little Cell, and th'Ape did gaine By begging Nuts and Aples which of yore By others paines were hoarded vp in store. Thus dayly did the subtile Ape obtaine Pleasure and profit both withouten paine, By which I weene compar'd to all the rest âAmongst all Craftsmen Beggers are the best: For eu'n the proud'st that thinkes paines taking's base To turne oft Begger thinkes it no disgrace. But whilest the Ape lull'd in security Did swim in pleasures and felicity Not wanting ought, for seldome did he craue The guift of ought but he the same might haue, The noble Elephant that in the Court Did beare chiefe sway amongst the supreame sort Like a true Statesman, for the Forrest good Against the Apes incessant begging stood. Whereby the Ape did stoope his gallant minde For though by information he might finde Ought worthy begging, yet the Princes grant Hee did not craue; because by th'Elephant Oft to reuoke his grant the King was mou'd If to the state it preiudiciall stood; Therefore the Ape that liu'd before secure And thought his golden begging would endure For euer certaine: with a heauy cheere Now hung the head; for well it did appeare Hee might goe swinke and sweat to get his liuing Since that the Forrest Prince did cease from giuing, Sir Reynald likewise that same crafty mate That did in the Apes beg'd guifts participate Now wanted meanes, whereby he might support His brauery 'mongst the gallants of the Court For long he watched had and cast about By his fine wit to finde some purchase out Some ancient Ruine of Antiquitie Or ought that might be tearm'd invtilie, But naught he found that in the Forrest stood That was invtilie for common good, Which when he did perceiue: halfe in despaire Vnto the Ape his friend he made repaire Who to each other often though in vaine Their sad mishap in secret did complaine. Yet in the end the Fox did finde a fetch âFor dire constraint, the wit at large doth stretch, Hee well remembred that if any beast Were found offensiue to the Kings beheast Or did infringe the Law through all the Woods By penall statutes lost both Lands and goods, The which without controle, as lawfull gaine Th'Ape for a boone by begging might obtaine, This once being thought vpon the wily Ape As carefull of their good this speech shape. Sir Reynald (said the Ape) wee be in case To be vndone vnlesse by Ioues good grace Against the storme, in time we doe prouide âTime runnes away and no man stayes the tide. You see that wee be needy and in lacke And in the Court, the eyes of euery Iacke Are fix'd vpon vs, and these garments old Cannot in Court our countenance long vphold. Then say (Sir Reynald) as yee be right wise What hopefull course for vs can you deuise Wee must prouide for helpe without delay Or hopelesse leaue the Court and runne away. The Fox reply'd full little did I weene That in this case so witlesse you had beene So long as hope remaines; why should wee doubt Haue wee not working wit to cast about, Then haue good hope, for wee in little space Will worke our selues againe in Fortunes grace, We know right well the Oxe and silly Sheepe Though they themselues from Court in priuate keepe As being but rusticke Chuffes of base account Yet they in wealthy substance farre surmount Whom if by subtilty we can but draw Within the compasse of the Princes law To stop our mouthes we shall haue golden fee So much they feare in danger for to bee. And if this faile; yet we vpon our oath As loyall subiects can appeach them both For speaches spoken 'gainst the Gouernment Or other trespasse, which we can inuent, Which that wee may to better purpose bring We can disgus'd, talke of the Forrest King And aske what tydings in the Princes Court What vice in common they doe most support And in their speech if we them tripping take VVee by addition can the matter make To seeme farre worse; by which if they i'th'end Conuicted bee; then that which we intend, VVee haue obtayn'd; for we their goods haue wonne In recompence of our good seruice done. This said, the Ape approuing Reynald wit In that hee at a pinch, could helpe with it VVith speed in some strange habit, both disgis'd VVould put in practise what hee had deuis'd. They both agreed themselues forthwith to clad Like stranger Countrymen of late decayed; VVhose habit and demeanor had you seene You would haue though the wretched Ape t'haue been Some sturdie Clowne that late had left the Carre And in this strange disguise had come from farre, Hee was y clad all in a Russet gray Of coursest stuffe, yet with such meane aray, He seemed well appay'd as did appeare Being well contented with his Countrey weare, His russet Ierkin, many yeares y worne Was waxen bare, and at the elboes torne: His Breeches of the same made scanty wise So close did sit vnto his brawny thighes, That his fat flankes that plumpe and jolly were, Like two round Balls did through the same appeare; Thereto, his blew round Cap him well became With a plume Feather pendant on the same, Which o'th'one side of his head he euer wore As if in minde some high conceit hee bore. A rusty Sword hee carryed by his side And at his backe a Dagger well ytide, For many hackes therein made long agoe Sufficient proofes did of the mettall show, His woollen Hose were of the purest white Of thicke strong knit, and yet in open sight Were broken 'boue the heeles, and both his Shooes Worne with long trauell out about the toes. And thus he trauayl'd with his fellow Foxe About the Forrest for to finde the Oxe, And silly Sheepe, whom the Ape had first espide In Field farre off, fast by the Riuer side, And said vnto the Foxe; Behold I see In yon same field, where they both grasing bee: Now proue your wit Sir Reynald, if you can, Begin you first, you are the grauer man. This sayd, they came where th'Oxe and Sheepe did grase, Whom thus the Foxe did greet with fawning phrase? All haile (Sir Oxe) said hee, full glad am I To see you beare your lofty head so high, It seemes to vs by this your goodly port You are in fauour in the Princes Court, You can informe vs of some tidings there And 'bout the Lyon who chiefe place doth beare. âThe Oxe reply'd, (good Sir) you deeme amisse âFor your coniecture goes astray in this, âSeeing Courtly fauour is no cause that I âSeeme thus to beare my branched head so hie, âBut humble thoughts, which wounded harts doe heale âIn sweet content, is cause of all weale, âPale enuy poyson to the Statesmans good âNere gnawes my heart ne suckes my vitall blood, âNor greedy Auaries of others shares âDisturbes my sweet content with boundlesse cares; âThese pastures bounds my thoughts doe euer bound, âNe doe I ioy to feed in stranger ground, âBut with my Fate suffic'd I still abide âNot fearing any ill that may betide, âOf Musickes rarest skill I take no keepe âAt any time to summon timely sleepe, âBut sweet voyc'd Birds, and milde Streames gently gushes âMy wear, limbes, in restfull quiet Hushes. âThe often horrid sounds of Court Alarmes âNe're startle me from sleepe for feare of harmes, âBut sleeping till the morne secure of feares, âThe Birds sing sweet Bon-jours about mine eares: âThus liue I happy in content of minde, âWhich wee in Courtly greatnesse seldome finde. Certes, said the Ape, it seemes yee be right wise That can of worldly weale so well aduise, And yet in this me seemes you haue digrest, For 'mongst the best you being a goodly beast To great aduancement, may your selfe soone bring And authorize high Seruice for the King. âAlas, (quoth th'Oxe) How vulgar is affection âIn vainely seeking after fond promotion, âAs well th'Ignoble as the Noble blood âDeeme vading pompe the happie mans chiefe good. âYet view the Court and marke the misery âOf those that swim in Court felicitie, âWhose wretched steps in Princes Court attends âHis slauish will on others wills depends, âHis turn-coat thoughts more light then lightest feather âTurn'd with the winde and return'd with the weather âEu'n as his Masters changing humour is, âMust turne and Change to like of that or this âAgainst his Conscience, praise impietie, âAnd sooth foule sinne with fawning flatterie. âAnd yet suppose thou shouldst exalted bee âTo some place past Court-crouching with the knee, âAnd by the helpe of Greatnesse finde such grace âAs neere the steps of Maiestie t'haue place, âYet marke (fond foole) and see what vnseene woe âWould follow thee though thou in Gold shouldst goe, âTo bee a Partner in the Priuitie âAnd close concealement of Authoritie, âThough to thy second selfe thou shew the same âOft winnes thee Death, and neuer dying shame; âYet in thy Conscience to conceale such things âVVhen life is gone, Death worse then death it brings. âOh then how blest and happy a wight is hee âThat liues from Court though nere so base he bee. T'enlarge this Theame the Sheepe did silence breake, âDeare neighbor Oxe (quoth he) the truth you speake, âYet more then this, doe many vndergoe âThat in the Court doe make a goodly show, âFor many there that beare so bold a face âAnd deeme all vulgars beggerly and base, âThat strut on Tiptoe, and with Elboe pride âAspire to reach the square from side to side, âOft stoope their gallant mindes and proue I weene, âVVorse Beggers farre then those that Beggers beene; âVVith fawning tongue and Court eclipsing guile âThey claw the Great in vices more then vile, âAnd then of this or that in daily begging, âThey still sollicite them with tedious gaping. âBut loe alas, what proues this hardracket store âGot by encroaching on the pined poore. âLifes bitter curse, while heere on Earth wee dwell âAnd Soules sad burthen bearing downe to Hell. âWhy then doe those that tediously importune âThe royall Lyon to aduance their Fortune, âThus base and Begger-like sollicite still âT'increase their profit by a generall ill: âThey knew the noble Lyons Royall minde âTo humble Suitors is by nature kinde, âNor stearne nor statefull to the Subiects base, âBut full of Lenitie and Gentle grace. âThey know hee striues by his benignitie âTo imitate the Gods in charitie, âWhich they will still abuse, being Begger-lipt, âTill from his Court such Beggers base be whipt, This speech so toucht the Ape, that with much paine Hee could himselfe in quiet moode containe. But Reynald thus reply'd. âWell haue you spoken âIn this behalfe, for these your words betoken âYour common care, which nature tyes vs to, âNot for our selues being onely borne to doe. âYet you (me seemes Sir Oxe') without such shift âBy merit may your selfe to honour lift, âSeeing euery where true merit hath her place âAt least it can no where receiue disgrace. The Oxe replay'd. âI would thy words were true âWould merit euery where might haue her due, âThen should I not behold vnto my griefe âThe meritorious want without reliefe. âBut loe, Ah lasse, behold the noble Horse âThat eu'n hath spent the vtmost of his force, â'Gainst th'Ãgle and the Dragon his proud mate âWho both of late made warre vpon our State, âHow oft haue I beheld him with delight âPreparing of himselfe for bloody fight, âWho neuer fear'd what might by foes bee done âWith Ha, ha, ha, the Battaile hath begun, âThe eyes of Gorgon burning in his head âWith feare hath made his fainting foes halfe dead. âAnd proudly prauncing with a side-long pace âLifting his fetlockes vp with nimble grace, âAll Rainbow-like hee bore his crest deckt necke âIn proud contempt of any Counterchecke, âThen on the hard ground hauing made some proofe âOf the strong battery of his hardy hoofe, âWith nimble Capers in a stately daunce âHe towards the battaile bold would proudly praunce, âAnd being come in sight of th'Armed foes âHee snuffes, he puffes, he Boggles, snoarts and blowes, âAnd neighing with shrill voyce, hee seemes to cry âAnd call for Combate with the Enemy. âThen like the Lightning from the Easterne ayre âOr swiftest whirlewind, in his fierce repayre âTo flie 'mongst thickest troupes he hath bin seene âTo lose his life, or worthy Conquest winne, âVVhere in a moment, from the dusty ground âInto the ayre hee vp would lightly bound, âAnd falling downe againe, with sinewie shankes âVVould beat and batter downe the thickest rankes, âFrom whence he oftentimes (though wounded) came âVVith Conquests high renowne, and endlesse fame. âBut now where is the meed of his true merit? âVVho now yeelds comfort to his fainting spirit? âLiue not the sonnes of Mars in euery eye âThe perfect maps of Ragged beggery, âAs often as their wounds they doe behold âThe which they tooke their Countries cause t'vphold, âTheir eyes, lippes, hands, and harts, to heau'n doe goe, âVVishing pale Death to end their helplesse woe; âVVhich being deny'd dire need doth them constraine âTo doe the thing their soules did once disdaine, âEu'n Begger-like one single Mite to craue âPoore life within his halfe-staru'd house, to saue. This said, the Foxe forthwith with winking eyne To th'Ape was decreed gaue priuie signe. Who stepping forth with countenance fell, thus spake âFriend Foxe quoth hee, your witnesse heere I take âOf their disloyall words, which intimate âTheir treacherous thoughts against the Prince &amp; State. âSure sayd the Fox, their speeches doe import âAs much as Treason, if 'twere heard in Court, âBut they perchance will happily repent âLet me disswade you then from your intent, âFor if the Councell of the Lyon dread âBee certified of this, they are but dead. âThey shall compound with you, and 'twere not good âFor you to seeke the shedding of their blood. With this intent the Fox thus spake, as hee That thought thereby to gaine some golden fee To stop their mouths, but both the Sheepe and Oxe, Perceiuing well the knauery of the Foxe, As they that guiltlesse were, withouten doubt Defied both Fox and Ape with courage stout. The Ape perceiuing this swore by his head For those their words, they should ere long be dead. And so enrag'd to Court he went againe With Reynald his slye copesmate to complaine. Where when they came, such Treason they detect Which 'gainst the Oxe and Sheepe they did obiect, That with swift summoning they cyted were Before the Lyons Councell to appeare. The time was set, and loe those Royall Peeres That on their backes the Forrests burthen beares Joue-like in Councell, each one tooke his place To giue their judgement in so weightie a case. The Guard attendant on the Forrest King The Oxe and Sheepe, vnto the Barre did bring; Then with shrill voyce, the Cryer 'mongst them all A generall silence through the Court did call, Which euery where aduisefull audience bred While thus th'Inditement by the Clerke was read. âCome forth Sir Oxe (sayd hee) stand at the Barre, âAnd thou Sir Sheepe, yee both Indited are âFor Treason, 'gainst the Lyon our dread King âWhich th'Ape and Foxe of late to light did bring, âAnd for lewd Speech vs'd 'mongst the vulgar sort âSeeking thereby for to defame the Court; âIntitling those by names of Beggers base, âThat for desert are in the Princes grace: âAnd which is worse for your disloyal hate âAnd treasonable grudging 'gainst the state âOf all which treasons worthy vengefull wreake âIf you be guilty or not guilty speake? âTo this, the Oxe not guilty did reply âAnd therewithall he craued liberty âWith humble suite that he might answer shape â'Gainst this Inditement of the Fox and Ape, âWhich granted after humble reuerence made âVnto the bench, these words he boldly sayd. âRight honored Lords, Peeres of a peerelesse King âFrom whose sole care our common good doth spring, âThe greatest part of treason vrged heere âAs by the inditement read may well appeare âConsists in words which as our foes report âBy vs were spoken 'gainst the King and Court: âBut daigne dread Lords, to marke what we haue sayd âAnd what construction thereof they haue made; âNaught 'gainst the Court or Courtier did wee say âBut 'gainst such Vice as in the Court beares sway. âThe Court where wonnes so many a Iouiall spring âMade famous by the influence of a noble King, âAs like Joues Pallace 'boue the starry skye, âRather to bee admir'd, then judg'd with mortall eye; âYet as in a Paradise of sweet delight âWith rarest Fruits and fairest Flowers bedight, âNe'rethelesse the care the cunning Gardener takes âHis hookes, his sythes, his pickaxe, spade and rakes, âSome fruitlesse weeds are growing on the ground: âSo in our Kings owne Pallace may bee found âAmongst the number that praise-worthy bee âSome wicked Beasts of more then base degree. âAnd 'gainst such Vice, as they doe there support âWee did inueigh; and not against the Court: âNe did we say, that such haue Beggers bin âThat by desert doe Grace or fauour winne: âBut such as dayly vse with restlesse gaping âWith cloaked falsehood and with tedious begging âOf our dread Soueraignes golden guifts to craue âAlthough no merit in themselues they haue; âThis is the summe in briefe of what we spake âAnd this is it which they would treason make. This said, dumbe silence for a certaine space Did shut the lips of all that were in place Till at the last, that great Heroe rose Who of the Forrests treasure doth dispose The noble Elephant, who as he stood From his sweet mouth powr'd forth a fluent flood Of honied eloquence, which wanting skill If I expresse the same, soone should I spill With sharpe inuectiue, first against that sort Of hungry Beggers that frequent the Court Hee did inueigh, then by his powerfull wit Hee shewed since he in Counsels seat did sit; How many priuate States had changed bin Which by obseruance he had mark't and seene, Supplanted all by cousenage of the Ape Or by some falsehood which the Fox did shape. Then 'gainst the Ape, his speech he gan to frame Hee shew'd what Beast he was and whence he came How Joue at first, for his deceiptfull guile Made him, of man a Beast, and in that Isle Call'd Ape Isle of his name, alone him put And how his taile at length for craft was cut. Then question'd he the Fox, to know if hee Against the Oxe and Sheepe would witnes bee And what true depositions he could bring That they intended treason 'gainst the King. The Fox though halfe amaz'd with suddaine feare To heare such words from such a mighty Peere, Yet that his witnes might seeme more t'haue troth Hee did vnbidden seeke to take his oath. The booke was brought; but loe the Eternall Ioue Who by his power protecteth from aboue The cause of Innocence, with dreadfull frowne From Heau'ns high Palace cast his count'nance downe And as the Foxe his oath began to take As Ioue but stirr'd, hee made Olympus shake, And thundring horribly aboue the skie, Through the ayre hee made a sulphurie flash to she, Which fell vpon the Foxe, for his foule sinne; And for his judgement strange, so syng'd his skinne That since, All Foxes smell of it and beare A synged colour euer in their haire. This suddaine change, amaz'd the standers by Who all with one consent, gan glorifie The name of Joue, and 's judgement forthwith gaue Against the Ape, who now no wit could saue From punishment; For 'bout the Forrest wide They whipt him well, and soundly lasht his hide. So did the Begger bluntly end his Tale, In which (your pardon J craue) if ought J faile And if in reading, Beggerly you hold it, Dislike it not, because a Begger told it. FINIS.</field>
