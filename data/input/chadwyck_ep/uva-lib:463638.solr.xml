For dethe wyll nat forgyue/to hye ne lowe his rent But after a yere or two/was gone expresse Kyng Alba from this lyfe/discessed/died and went For whom Custance made/great mone &amp; heuynesse To god she prayed/his soule from payne release And soone after that he/was deed and layde in clay Custance towarde Rome/her dressed on the way. Custaunce aryued at Rome/that riche cyte Wher as her frend? were/on lyue/both hole &amp; so?de Nowe hath she escaped/all harde aduersite And whan she her father/the Emperour had fo?de Upon bothe her knees/she fell vnto the grounde Wepyng in hert for ioye/and with a corage bolde Our lorde she thanked/an h?dred thousande folde. Of all her trouble/her sorowe care and drede Whiche in her most peryle/fr? dethe dyd her def?de And with her frendes there/in quietnesse dyd lede The rest of her lyfe/and neuer dyd entende Tyll dethe to disceuer/and thus I make an ende Of Custauce storie/beseching Christ that he Bring th? vnto his blysse/which shall it rede or se.
