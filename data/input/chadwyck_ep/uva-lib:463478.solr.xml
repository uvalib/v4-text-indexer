      <field name="fulltext">TO THE NOBLE and MOST VERTUOUS LADY, Mrs. Anne Leedes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Noble Friend M? Edmund Prestwich, upon his Elegant POEMS. Sir, You have gently cur'd my fears, and I Congratulate Emergent Poesie, And you her Tutelar Angel, who have made Her live, and by your wit secur'd her shade By you, (his better Seneca) reviv'd Hippolitus is now grown longer liv'd; And Seneca himself that could not dye, Hath gain'd another Immortality Yet here, you but translated; when you chuse An amarous Tract, and speake your own free Muse My admiration over-reads my Eye, And I am last in the full Harmony. Ja: Shirley. To my Worthy Friend M? Edmund Prestwich, on his Translation of Hippolitus. Hard is thy Fate (great wit) thus to advance Thy Poem in this age of Ignorance, To send it forth in such a time as this, Where none must judge but such as judge amisse; Course sordid censurers, that thinke their eyes Abus'd if fixt, on ought but Mercuries, When honest judgements will not doubt to swear Thy work deserves an Amphitheatre. Nor is this piece such as of late hath been The tedious stuffe of Poetasters seen, Wit to a nobler height, doth thine intend; No common labour to no common end: For by thy Version wee are taught anew, T' interpret what we vainly thought we knew But still mistook; so that in this we finde Thou canst do Miracles, and cure the blinde. The Orac'lous mist from Seneca is fled, Which with fresh Laurel, crowns his verdant head, And the black curtain of his clowded sense, Is drawn by thy exact Intelligence. Hippolitus that erst was set upon By all, mangled by mis-construction Dis-membred by mis-prision, now by thee And thy ingenious Chirurgerie; Is re-united to his limbs, and grown Stronger as thine, then when great Theseus son. Go on then wits example, and revive, What none but such as thee, can keep alive; Slack not the work for want of Industry For not a line, of those thou writ'st can die. Char: Cotton. To his most Honoured and most Ingenious Friend, M?. Edmund Prestwich, upon his happy Translation of Seneca, his Tragedy of Hippolitus. VVretched Translators! they who only know How like the Moon reflections faint to show To those benighted Ignorants that dare Not look upon the Sun in his own Sphear; That their Translations are the Authors Hell Where nothing but their ghastly shaddows dwell. Thine's a Pathelion in height and glory Yet not prodigious nor transitorie. By this thy Version Seneca doth get, A better Genius fresher bayes hath met. What can I say, but thou translat'st him even, As God would man from Paradise to Heaven; But sin those coppies blur'd so that but one True Manuscript could find Translation. Hippolitus hath such a handsome Mine Drest by thee; thy Muse, worse than th' Attick queen Will I'm afraid in this transplanted Grove Incestuously her own Issue Love. Hee's truly Virbius, for thou hast done More for him now, then erst did Phœbus sonne; When his torn limbs lay like a shatter'd lute He them patch'd up, with new breath did recruit. In Miracles yet him thou dost out-doe Giv'st other life and that Immortall too. Joves Vengeance damp't his art, that durst controul The Laws of Fate, bring home a once fled soul. Thine to doth thee to Heavens envy raise, But th'art secure from thunder by thy bayes But why translate, gild, hatch, why not appear Thy solid self, sad Ingot, neat, not tear, As when men court the Maidenhead of light, Desire to see the first, first rayie flight Of Phœbus shafts, they face about to th' West There see some cliffe kist by the new-come Guest; So in the ponent of things past must we Look for thy day-break, and lo there we see Thy dawning wit, with early glory play On this Iberian Mount of Corduba. And I'm content, 'cause my weake eyes are able To see thy Sun thus in the water dabble; But risen to his Zenith, Oh, who can Stare at thy Halos, when Meridian? Cromwel Stanhop. To his much Lov'd Friend M? Edmund Prestwich on his Translation of Hippolitus. Dearest, Mistrust not; thy Hippolitus, Will rellish much, with God with Us, And I'm ascertain'd that this Nation, Likes nothing like to a Translation. Ric. Rogers. To his Honoured and Ingenious Friend M?. Edmund Prestwich on his Translation of Hippolitus. To say that now the Pedant understands Words, which no comment open'd to his hands Or sense, his brains less able to obey, Than patience, or the forgotten quarter-day, Were praises of a pestilence more dead Than thunder, t' blast thy Laurel 'bout thy head. To bring thee commendations from their schools Were to translate the wisemen into fools As if we added unto Books more state By Imprimaturs fetch'd from Billinsgate. No, to praise thee's to shew this age of ours How far thy Fancy, outwings Cesars powers, He, who joynd seas, &amp; piniond Neptuns arms Affrighted Nature with the wild alarms Of his Triumphant madness might transfer His hand ore th' life of that Philosopher, Thy Poets Ancestor, which to restore Must make ev'n vanquish'd Nero cry no more Here all my Powers make Alt; but thou hast made Thy Poet a new body to his Shade; Not the long sleep of fifteen hundred yeers, Nor the confusion of inrich't Sepulchers, Where's better part lay gnawn on by those moths Of happy Spirits, ignorance &amp; goths; Affright thy daring Genius thou dost state The laws of Nature, and decrees of Fate Bidst massie Marble, her entomb'd up give: Command'st ev'n dust, re-animate and live: Mak'st this Tragedian, by new life be known Less signall in all Tragedies than's own. He lives in greater beauty than wh? th'throng Of ravish'd Romans fed their ears with's song. Thus Poets, (if their happy thought can clime But to as high an excellence as thine) Like the last Angel in th'dissolvent skies, Bid but the dead awake, and they arise. Edward Williams. To his Honoured and Ingenious Friend M?. Edmund Prestwich, upon his Poems, and Translation of Hippolitus. Most men wil sure mistake when they behold My rustick Muse, thus confidently bold Entruding in your Front; till they shall know Her humbler pride, conceal'd her far more low Until surpris'd, commanded, and confin'd, Unto this height, by your Magnetick minde Which you so richly have Imbodyed here Though in anothers mould; you can appear (I do believe in full as various shapes As Jupiter ere did to act your rapes Upon our Muses, since your curious art Hath wrought a miracle of this desert Which (like a Verger) I would stand and tell Did not its Character too much excell My crepid fancy, whilst by your Translation As by a Magically replantation From the vitriall form, old Seneca y've rais'd In as full verdancy, as his most prais'd, And vigorous youth, h've rendred him before Both Symetry, and Features, and whats more Given life by Tragedy; Founding your Art In true Pilosophy, which you impart In lively Helycon to th' torrid wits Of our poore panting times, where nought befits The raging humour, but what's worthless born Mean as the age; beneath a Poets scorn. Though some there are, whose true born Eagle eies, Will rightly scan it, and return the prize Of ful grown Laurel, to the full blown Muse Of your yet springing brow; none will refuse To add a branch unto that wreath; whilst I Thus like a shade contentedly stand by. A Sable Foil dropt on the beauteous Front And yet not cast the least of Lustre on't Your Humble devoted Mat. Carter. HIPPOLITUS ENGLISHED.Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text.

Chorus. Theseus. Nutrix. Actus Primi. Scena Prima. Enter Hippolitus, and divers servants, as to Hunting. Hip. Go, and surround the shady woods, and those High cliffs, which do impale the mountains brows Disperse, and with your quickest speed descry Those ragged quarries under Parnes tye View the Thriasian vales, and banks which are Worn by the force of rapid torrents, there Clime up these hils, which with obdured snow Are ever crownd. Some of you this way go Where the high aldars into arbours tye The woods, where those embroidered fields do lie Which Zephyr, quickning with his dewie breath Decks with those flowers he called from beneath Where smooth Ilissus runs flank'd on both sides With Isicles, where slow Meander glides Ore th' equall fields, and frets the sterile shore Run with unprofitable waters ore. Take you the left path, whence the woods descry'd To Marathon, where beasts, accompani'd With flocks of yonglings, do their stomacks right Grown bold by the protection of the night. Go you more Southerly, and take the way Leads to frost-thawing Acarnania. The rock of sweet Hymetus you: the small Aphidnæ you must visit; this Part shall Yet rest, where the embowed Ocean doth On Suniori beat it self into a froth. Whoever hath a soul with Glory fir'd Him Philalis doth call Lo here retir'd Lies the fierce Boar, the lab'ring Husbands fear But too well known, now by those wounds they wear Slip you the silent dogs, and you restrain Th' impatient courage of th' Molossian: And let the struggling Cretensian Bitch With her bald neck the stubborn Collar stretch. But have a care that straighter couples hold The fiery Spartane, for the dog is bold And eager after game, the time draws nigh The caves shall Eccho back, the deep mouth'd cry Now may they, while the dawning lasts, while yet The dew retains the figure of their feet, The air examine with a curious guest, And on the nose run to the holds 'oth' beast; While he, bowing beneath the burthen, beares The more unus'd, lay you the lesser snares. The painted counterfeit, from thence will speed The frighted Beasts, into our toils indeed Do you a light and missile javelin shake, But you in either hand a Boar-spear take And so employ your might, in ambush laid Drive you the game, by your loud cryes dismaid Headlong into our nets; and as for you Embowell what we happen to subdue! Assist sacred Virago, for thou art Sole Queen of the worlds solitary part: Thy never-erring shafts the Beasts doe slay That drinks the cold Araxes, or doth play In frozen Ister: Cretan Harts by thee And Lybian Lions persecuted be: Now lightly woundest thou the flying Buck To thee, the spotted Tigre to be struck Proffers his brest; Thou for thy ease mayest take The Buffs broad horns, or the Buls humbled back Whatever feed in deserts, whether they Be known to the rich-grov'd Arabia, Or needy Garamas, let their abodes, Be in Pyrenean Cliffs, or Hircan woods, They and the vagabonding Scythians bear To thy Artillery an awfull fear. Whose Piety hath thee's Associate made, Broke by no feet, his nets have fettered The captiv'd Beasts; the Cart hath seemd to groan, Under the weight of the brave prey thereon. Then the Dogs Snouts in blood are dy'd, then come The glorying Huntsmen, as in Triumph home. Hearken, my Dogges do spend, and the hot cry Assures me I have pleas'd her Deity. I'm summon'd to the woods, this way Ile take Whereby I may the shorter journey make. Exit. Scena Secunda. Phædra. Nurse. Ph. O Crete, great Soveraign of the Seas that be Replete with ships, on each side coasting thee, All such as plough the Deep, and cut their way Thorow these Floods, open t' Assyria; Why am I hostage, where I hate? or why, Given in Marriage to my Enemy, To be drawn out in misery and teares, Hast thou condemnd the remnant of my yeares? My wandring Husband absent Theseus hath Not in his Marriage, lost his wonted faith. Champion to an audacious Suitor now The Hero stalketh in the dark below; Pluck'd from the throne of the infernall King These mad-men Proserpine again will bring. Nor fear, nor sence of shame restrain him: Thus The glorious Father of Hippolitus. In Hell it self endeavoureth to meet With lowless pleasures and forbidden sheets. But (ah) I am with greater weights opprest Not from my cares by Night or sleep releast: The Ill is nourish'd, which too fast doth grow And burns within; so vapours straitned flow From the wombe of Ætna idle stands The loom, the shittle falleth from my hands. Now in their Temples do I take no care To bribe the Gods with vows to hear my prayer Nor 'twixt the Altars, joyn'd with Attick Dames, Shake in those silent Duties conscious flames. Nor with chast Prayers, and pious rites draw near The Goddess, that Præsides by conquest here. I rather would pursue the roused beast My soft hand with a rugged javelin prest. O! whither will my vexed soul? Alas, Why Frantick, doe I thus affect the chase? My mothers crime was fatall now I prove And in the Woods have plac'd my sinful Love. Mother, I doe repent thee now. Thou took A Bull, wild, and impatient of the yoke. Distemper'd with thy ill, thy lust prefer'd The Fierce Conductor of the Salvage herd. Yet did he something love: What God can ease, What Dedalus can quench such flames as these Should he return, whose powerfull Art did build The Labyrinth my Brothers Monster held He could not help, my case admits of none Venus offended with the tell-tale Sun, On us his off-spring doth revenge the Gyves She, and her Mars sustain'd, who ere derives Herself from Sol, Venus depraves her mind None dead with Love, but Love and impious joyn'd. Nu. Thou wife of Theseus, and the child of Jove From thy chaste brest drive this unseemly Love: Quench me these Flames, nor yeeld to such a hope As may affright thee. He who gives a stop And a Repulse to Love at first, hath bin Victor, and Safe: who cherishes the Sin, Too late denyes to undergo the yoke Himself put on: Neither am I mistooke In Princely tumors, how the stubborn mind Scorns truth, and will not be to right inclind, The Fates decrees are welcome, who are old To see their end approaching grew more bold. First wilt t' oppose, nor faulter in that will, 'Tis next to modesty to know in ill A measure. Wretch! what wilt thou do? Ah, why Dost thou increase thy houses infamy, And overact thy Mother? this exceeds Her sin, and more than monstrous be thy deeds. For to compulsive Fate we attribute Monsters, but sins to manners we impute Think'st thou thy crime more safe and void of fear 'Cause Theseus sees not what is acted here? Thou art mistaken, for suppose he dwell For ever there, doom'd t' a perpetuall Hell. What will thy Father doe; thy Father aws The Sea, and gives a hundred Cities Laws: And Parents are quick-sighted; What will he Winke at so horrid an Impiety? But grant our craft, or circumspection might Conceal it from him. What will that great Light Of all things, Father to thy Mother doe? What the Gods fruitfull Seminator, who As he his Thunder brandishes, doth shake The trembling world? are these like to mistake Canst thou yet hope unseen, to keep thy crime From these All-seeing Grandfathers of thine? But say the fav'ring Deities should hide The fact, and (as it does great sins betide) None credited thy incest: yet thou'lt finde A present pain, a self accusing mind, With horror big, and of is self afraid, Some unreavel'd, none sin unpunished. Bridle thy impious love, a crime which yet No barb'rous Nation ever did commit: To Goths, and Scythians, and those who on Inhospitable Taurus dwell unknown. From thy chaste brest expell these strange desires, Thy Mother warnes thee from such uncouth fires: Shall Son, and Father have one common bed, Thy impious womb fill'd with a mixed seed? Well, doe; with thy illicite flames make war 'Gainst Nature, and impose new Laws on her. We are at want of Monsters, and of late Thy Brothers Court (alas) is desolate! Shall unaccustom'd births the world appall And Nature be as oft unnaturall As a Cretense shall love? Ph. I know dear Nurse, Your counsel's good, but I must follow worse; Fury compelleth: Wittingly I stray, Striving in vain my judgement to obey, So when an over-burdened ship receives The unwelcome Buffets of encountring waves, Vain is the Seamans toil, in spite of them The Vessel goes with the prevailing stream. Love reason vanquishes, and countermands Nor will admit a Rivall where he reigns, His Kingdome is the World, he hath great Jove Scorched with the unruly flames of Love. Fired the brest of the stern God of war. And the dread-thunder-forging Mulciber; He, who in Ætna, doth for ever turn, The glowing Embers with a spark doth burne Phœbus himself who aims his shafts so true, By the more skillful Boy is wounded too. Grievous his power in Heaven, in Earth the same. Nu. Lust fav'ring Vice did first this Godhead frame And that it might the greater freedome have The name of Deity to fury gave. Condemn'd (forsooth) by Venus for to live Thorough the World a restless fugitive He, as he through the yeelding air doth sly, Fashions his troublesome Artillery; And now this Little one so great is grown The Gods submit to his dominion. These Vanities were feignd: Some guilty mind To her a Godhead, him a bow assign'd. Swell'd with prosperity who flows in Vice Not daining to admit one pleasure twice; Lust the companion of great Fortunes waits On him: he is not pleas'd with wonted cates Firm-builded houses, nor your grosser meat. Why doth this Pallace-haunting plague retreat From humble roofs? a pious Love dwells there: The Vulgar have affections void of fear. Princes, and rich men will have more than right When meaner men can curb their appetite. Who but too much can doe, yet would that he Could more. Consider thou thy quality And thy returning Husbands Scepter fear. Ph. Alas Love swayes his powerfull Scepter here And I fear no returns, none gone from hence To the dark house of death find passage thence. Nu. Be not too credulous, say the gates of Hell Were shut, and Cerberus the Centinell: Theseus hath forc'd the way hath bin forbid. Ph. Yet he perhaps would pardon, if did. Nu. Why He was cruell to a wife was chaste Antiope can testifie his hast. But grant we might appease thy angry Spouse, Yet who can move the stern Hippolitus? He doth abhor the very name of wife, And obstinately vows a single life. Marriage he shuns, an Amazon thou knows. Ph. Stay, he in mountains crown'd with frequent snows, Or fly he over the sharp rocks; I will Follow him through the woods, and ore the hils. Nu. Will he be tempted who resisteth Love? Will he chaste pleasures for unchast remove? Be kind to thee, for whom (perhaps) alone He hates the sexe? Ph. With prayers he may be won. Nu. Hee's cruell. Ph. Love tameth the cruell too. Nu. Hee'l flie. Ph. Flie he by Sea, I will pursue. Nu. Remember thou thy Father. Ph. We doe call Our Mother too, to memory withall. Nu. All woman-kind he hates. Ph. I am the more Secure, of being rival'd with a whore. Nu. Theseus will come. Ph. And Pyrithous together. Nu. Thy Father'l come. Ph. What Ariadnes Father. Nu. By these dear brests, by these time-dyed hairs, And by this bosome over-worn with cares, I pray thee have compassion on thy selfe. For to desire it is a peece of health, Ph. I have not lost all shame: Nurse I obey. The Love I cannot rule I conquer may. Thou shalt not suffer in thy Fame; this is The onely reason bridles my amiss. My Husband will I follow, and prevent My sin by death. Nu. Dear Madam, some restraint, Give to these passions. I the more esteem Your life, because you do your self condemn. Ph. Yes, dye I will: but whether halter, knife, Or leap from Pallas tower conclude my life I know not yet. Oh that my chastity Can only guarded by selfe-ruine be. Nu. What think'st thou me? so impotent my age To suffer this? yet moderate thy rage. Ph. To such as merit, and resolve to dye Reason in vain doth urge the contrary. Nu. Thou onely comfort of my aged yeares, Since so perverse, a fate thy will ore bears, Contemn thy fame. Fame speaks not as it shou'd Good to the bad, and bad unto the good. Let us assay him, and this Nature prove, So froward, so intractable to Love. This labour shall be mine; Ile undertake The Stubborn youth, and exorable make. Exeunt. CHORUS. Goddess, the off-spring of the troubled floud, And Mother to as troublesome a God, The twin'd Cupid; with what a certain aim, Alike immod'rate in his flames and them, The boy his shafts doth levell! the disease Creeps through the marrow and impoverishes With an insinuating fire the veins. The Wound appeareth not in scars, but pains Within, ransacks the very bones; this boy To peace is a professed enemy. Thorow the world, his shafts are nimbly thrown, Those Coasts that first salute the rising Sun, Or hid him last good night: those that do sweat Under the torrid Crabs consuming heat, And those which doe beneath the cold Bear freeze, Peopl'd but with uncertain Colonies Have felt these flames; in youth he blows the fire, Reviveth age-extinguished desire In crazed limbes, and the cold Virgins snow Melts with a warmth her bosome doth not know. At his command the Gods forsake the skies, And borrowed shapes obscure their Deities. Phœbus his harp layes by; unequall reeds Gather the herd he in Thessalia feeds. How often hath the cloud-dispelling Jove Bin clothed in the meanest shapes for love? Now like a Swan he claps his silver wings, And sweeter than the dying true one sings. Now like a wanton Steer in play doth take The Royall Virgin on his humbled back, With his oare-imitating feet he plyes His brothers waves, and unknown Realms descries; He breaks the Sea with his opposed brest, Of his fair Rape, fear'd to be disposest. The clear-fac'd Goddess of the night hath burn'd, And over her forsaken Chariot turn'd To her unskilful Brother; now the Sun Doth learn to drive two horses, and doth run, A shorter course; day rises slowly, and night, Keeps no proportion with the wronged light Retarded by the unaccustom'd weight. Alcides hath his quiver laid aside, And the Nemæan Lions dreadfull hide; Now he the Emrauld to his finger fits And his neglected hair in order sits. With gold-embroidered buskins he doth bind His legs, his feet, in yellow socks contein'd, And with that hand in which the club was born He twists the threed, and doth the spindle turn. Persia, and fruitfull Lydia saw the skin Of the fierce beast lye by rejected then; And those huge shoulders, which did once support And serve for pillars to the heavenly Court, Clad in a Pall with Tyrian purple dy'd, The fire is sacred, (credit those have try'd) And but too potent; for as far as land By the salt Ocean is invirond, and The scattered Stars illuminate the Skie, Reaches the Kingdom of this peevish boy. Though guarded by the interposed seas, His darts have wounded the Nereides; Nor could the Ocean quench the kindled flame, The feather'd Nation too hath felt the same, By lust provok'd; how the fierce Bull hath warr'd To be the sole Commander of the Herd! The tim'rous Hart his rival once in sight, Fearles, himself addresses to the fight; And testifies his fury with his voice. Then the black Indies tremble at the noise, Of spotted Tigres: Then, all white his mouth. With rage engendred foam, the wild Boar doth His deadly tushes whet: The Lyon when He feels this sting of Love, his horrid mane Tosses on high, the very forrest faints Then with the noise of her inhabitants. The Monsters of the deep this power have prov'd, Both they, and the Lucanian Oxe have lov'd. Nature doth claim a priviledge in all, Her yoke is universall, hate doth fall At the command of Love, that ancient fire Extinguish'd by the new one of desire, Why should I more rehearse? it is enough We see a Step-dames bosome not of proof Against the Strok of Love. What news bringst thou? Speak Nurse, and say, where thou hast left her now. Finis Actus Primi. Actus Secundi. Scena Prima. Nurse. Nu. No hope can salve this sore, nor wil that fire Be ever quench'd which frenzy raizes higher Although no crackling flame, although conceald In her close brest, 'tis by her face reveal'd; Her eies doe sparkle, and her shrunke cheeks flie The light. Best pleased with variety Is her divided soul; her body feels The motion of her troubled sprite and reels. Now her faint limbs a dying measure tread, And scarce her weary neck sustains her head; Now would she rest a while, but straight forbears Forgotten sleep, and spends the night in teares: She rises, and again is laid: Shee looses Her scattered tresses, and again composes; She varies habit, weary of her self, And grows regardles both of food and health; She languishingly goes, her strength decay'd And from her cheeks the wither'd roses fade. Care doth dissolve her joynts: a trembling pace She holds, not near so comely as shee was. And those same eyes, that testified her line From Phœbus, nothing like her Grandsire shine. Still are her cheeks with teares bedewed: so A warm showr melteth the dilated snow Upon the cliffs of Taurus; but behold The Court is ope, where on a couch of gold Leanes the inclined Lover, and her brain Distemperd, doth her own attire disdain. Ph. Good maids these gold and purple garments bear From hence, what should the Tyrian dye doe here? Or wooll, which the trees mollified rind Yeelds to the Sexes? a short Zone shall bind My loins, for expedition girt; no load Of pearl, on us by Indian Seas bestowd, Shall lengthen out my cares, nor will I deck With any Carkanet my widdowed neck. No perfume my dishevel'd hair doth need, Careless upon my neck and shoulders spread, And by the wind displayed, my left shall bear A quiver, and my right hand shake a spear. Such was Hippolita, and as she guides From frozen Tanais, and Mæotis sides Her troops to Attick coasts, her hair collected Into a knot, and then again rejected; A Crescent shield gaurding her side, even so Accoutred I, into the woods will goe. Nu. Complain no more, grief doth not ease (great Queen) The wretched. Wil the fire observe a mean? Invoke the Virgin Goddess of the wood. Hail sacred Queen of forrests, whose abode Alone is on the hills; alone who art There worshipped, these dire portents avert. Thou, the woods awfull Deitie: the bright Planet of Heaven, the ornament of night, One of the worlds alternate lamps, the trine Aspected Hecate favour our design. Tame this hard-hearted youth, that he may learn To love, and with a mutuall ardour burn; Incline his cares, his brest unarme, his mind Ingraft in hers, though froward, harsh, unkind; Let him pay Venus homage, thus thy might Employ. So still unshaded be thy light. Through the dispersed clouds making thy way With thy resplendent horns: so from thy sway May no Thessalian Witches thee constrain, Nor thou thy honour forfeit to a Swain. Goddess invok'd, thou'st heard my prayer, lo now I see him paying of his yearly vow. Alone he is, wherefore are these delayes? Art must be us'd. Fortune gives time and place. What tremble I? 'tis hard for to obey A Crime, but he that fears a prince must lay Conscience aside, and modesty expell, The bashfull never serv'd a Monarch well. Scena Secunda. Hippolitus. Nurse. Hip. Thy weary steps why hither bendest thou With such a clouded face, &amp; troubled brow, Good Nurse? I hope my Father is not dead, Nor Phædra, nor the pledges of their bed. Nu. Fear not, obsequious Fortune, on thy house, Still waits, and still the land is prosperous. But thou, mild as thy houses fate, to me, Give ear, who 'm so sollicitous for thee; Because thou thus afflictst thy self, whom fate Makes wretched, we may wel comiserate; But who court danger, and themselves abuse With needless tortures, they deserve to loose Those blessings which they knew not how to use. Rather in pitty of thy yeers, thy mind Release, and in a festive measure joyn'd, Advance thy torch; in wine thy sorrows drown Enjoy thy youth, which will be gone too soon. Now apt for all Impressions is thy brest, Venus to yong men, is a welcome guest. Now glad thy soul: Why shouldst thou lye alone? Solace thy youth, but too unpleasant grown: Slacken the reins, wholly to riot bent. Nor let thy better dayes be thus mispent. The Gods draw out our lives by their degrees Allotting them peculiar properties. Cheerfull when yong, in age reserv'd. Why doth A hard restraint thus kill thy toward youth? A large encrease shall crown the husbands toil, Whose seed is tightly fitted to his soil: And all the trees are over-grown by those Which still uncropt preserve their maiden boughs. Good dispositions greatest praise doe merit When nat'rall freedom guides a noble spirit. Salvage, and ignorant, thou to a wife Preferr'st a melancholy single life. Dost thou thinke toil a priviledge? to ride The fierie courser till he lose his pride, Or try the bloudy issue of a field? When the eternall providence beheld So many enemies to life he made Fresh off-springs to replenish the decay'd. Go too. Let Venus of humane affaires Dispose, who our diminish'd stock repairs; Should but our youth be barren all thou sees, After an ages standing vanishes. Coverd'with rubbish, the uncultur'd land Would lye, the sea unnavigated stand, The empty forrest; beasts, air, birds would want, The wind being the sole inhabitant. How many casuall deaths on mankind wait, Extinguish'd by the sea, the sword, deceit! But say that these were wanting: yet to all For to pursue their end is naturall. Nature the guide of life, obey'd, frequent The Citty then, and publike meetings haunt. Hip. There is no life more free, void of offence, Or nearer to the pristine Innocence, Than what is to the woods confind, who lives With a clear Conscience on the mountains cliffs Is not enflam'd with avarice, nor draws The aire of seldome merited applause. Is not with envy swell'd, nor kindnes blown, Nor favorite, nor vassall to a crown. He covets not vain honours, nor th' uncertain tide Of wealth, not hope and fear doe him divide Him scarce the poisonous tooth of malice wounds Nor doth he know the usuall crimes of towns, And great concourses, feares not every noise Like guilty persons, nor inventeth lies; A thousand Columes don't his roof uphold, Nor are his rafters fastened with gold. His Altars doe not flow with streams of blood, Nor, with the sacred meal, their foreheads strew'd, A Hecatombe of white oxen expects The stroak of death, and bow their hundred necks. But he the countrey doth enjoy, endu'd With a most sweet and pleasing solitude. Harmless he wanders through the open air, Nor can he any thing but beasts ensnare. And, when with labour faint, his weary limbs Refreshes with Ilissos Chrystall streams. Now he on bankes of swift Alpheus lyes, Now thickest coverts of the wood descries, (Where cool Lerna through her transparent spring Shews her clear bottome,) ever wandering. Here birds complain, there th'ancient Beech receive Some gentle wind, and shakes her tremblng leaves Strech'd on a winding shore he loves to take A nap, and the bare turfe his bed doth make; Whither a fountain falls in scatter'd showers, Or flying streams salute the new-born flowers With murm'ring courtship: Wildings are his food, And strawb'ries gather'd from the underwood. Meats quickly cooked, he delights to fly Far from the Courts excessive luxurie, Let the ambitious drinke in golden cups. With what a gust he the pure fountain sups From his convexed palm; and sleep more sound Securely laid on the obdurate ground. He lewdly seeks not a retired bed, Nor in close corners hides his fearfull head: But he doth the fresh air, and light enjoy, And that he liveth, Heaven can testifie. I verily beleeve those Heroes did Live thus whom after ages Deifi'd. They had no thirst of gold, no sacred stones Did limit their unknown possessions. Bold ships plough'd not the deep, to forreign shores; But kept to their own seas, no lofty towres And ample bulwarks did the city fence, In armes an universall ignorance. No engines forc'd the gates, no oxen plough'd The earth; she wore no badge of servitude, Flelds fruitfull of themselves suffic'd to feed A sparing people that did little need. Woods native riches, and some shadie cave To them unartificiall lodgings gave. First headstrong wrath, a furious love of gain, And lust, which in enflamed minds doth reign, Broke this integrity, then did there come A bloody thirst of Empire in the room. Great men did prey upon the less, and might Was chosen arbitrator unto right. Then with bare hands they fought: untrimed boughs And stones were the first weapons they did use. The cornell was not shod with ir'n, nor ty'd The souldier a long sword unto his side, Nor horses manes crested their helmes; but vext With smart they took the weapons that were next. Dire Mars invented war-like stratagems, And thousand forms of death, hence purple streams Defil'd each land: bloud dy'd the blushing mane Then endles crimes in ev'ry house did reign: No sin but grew a President; the child, His Father, Brothers have their Brothers kill'd, Women their Husbands, wicked Mothers slew Their infant births. What then did Step-dames doe Nothing indeed's more mild than beasts, but this Woman, sins ringleader and Artifice Besets our souls, how many Cities are Fir'd by her Incests, lands ingag'd in war, And peoples by the ruin'd weight opprest Of their own Countries? not to name the rest: Medea speaketh the sexe cruell. Nu. Why. Condemn'st thou all for ones Impiety. Hip. I flie, abhor, curse all. Whether it from Reason, or nature, or meer frenzy come: I love to hate them: Water shall abide Sooner with fire: Vessels securely ride In the devouring Syrtes; the bright day Sooner shall rise from the Hesperian Sea, And wolves be mild to kids, than this my mind Admit a courteous thought of woman-kind. Nu. Love, the perverse oft tameth, and removes All hatred this thy Mother Country proves. Ev'n that fierce Nation did obey the will Of Love, or thou hadst been ungotten still. Hip. In this respect I'm glad my Mothers dead, Because my hate is now unlimited. As a fix'd rock on every side, in vain Assail'd by waves, doth beat them back again; So he despises what I say: but see Where the impatient lover comes (ah me) What Fate attends her? whither falleth shee? Upon the earth her body breathless lyes, And death-like paleness doth benight her eyes, Madam look up, unloose your tongue, behold, Hippolitusses arms do you enfold. Scena Tertia. Phædra. Hippolitus. Nurse. VVho calls me back to grief; my bosome fir'd A new? how sweetly had I here expir'd? But why refuse I life? courage my mind, Try, execute what thou thy self injoyn'd. Speak boldly, she, who fearfully doth crave, Begs a deniall; my worst crime I have Acted long since. Shame commeth now too late, I've lov'd a sin, if in it fortunate, A Husbands name may palliate the deed; Those sins are oft thought honest, which succeed. Go too, begin my soul. Sir, I a while desire Your privacy: let all the rest retire. Hip. See here is none to interrupt us; speak. Ph. But my seal'd lips cannot the silence break. Both urg'd to speech, and forced to be still. I call you Gods to witness that my will. Hip. Can you not speak your mind. Nu. Great griefs are best By silence, little ones by words exprest. Hip. Mother give me the burthen of your cares. Ph. The name of Mother to much distance bears. An Humbler name becomes our Love. Call us Thy sister, or thy maid, Hippolitus. But rather maid. I the most slavish yoke Will wear. Command it shall be undertook. Ile clime the frozen Pindus through deep snows Run through the fire, and armed troops; expose My naked brest to naked swords, receive This Scepter then, and let me be thy slave. To rule becommeth thee, me to obey. It ill becomes a womans arm to sway So great a Nation, thou who 'rt in the pride Of blooming youth, thy Fathers people guide. Protect thy suppliant in thy bosome hid. Take pitty on a widdow. Hip. Heaven forbid: Madam my Father will come safely back: Ph. From Styx, and those insatiate realms no track Doth lead to the forsaken light, shall he Who came a ravisher, dismisled be? 'Lesse Plut'ol sit down a tame Cuckold too. Hip. Heavens far more equall power this will doe. But while it yet rests in suspence, Ile please My Brethren with all fitting offices Protect Thee, that thou seem not widdowed: I The absence of my Father, will supply. Ph. O credulous Lovers! O deceitfull Love! Hath he not said enough? now prayers shall move. O pitty; hear even my silence wooe. I would, yet would not speak. Hip. What ailest thou? Ph. That which thou little thinks a step-dame should Hip. Speak plainly and thy doubtful words unfold. Ph. Why Love within my raging bosome fumes, And with a cruel fire my reins consumes. The flame which in my bowels hid remains Thence shooteth up and down my melting veins, As agile fire over dry timber spread. Hip. What with chast love of Theseus thou art mad? Ph. Thou art in the right: I love that ancient face Which Theseus had when he a stripling was; When first the down budding upon his chin He saw the house the Minotaur was in, And crooked mazes the long thred up wound. How glorious then? his hair with fillets bound, A dainty blush over his cheek was spread, And his soft arms were the securest bed. Like thy Diana, or my Phœbus then; Or rather thee: thus, thus he looked, when He pleas'd his foe; thus loftily did bear His head, but thou art something hansomer; Thou'st all thy fathers parts; and yet against Reason some of thy Mothers too retain'st, A Scythian rigour in a Græcian face; Had'st thou come with thy Father in those dayes, Then Ariadnes clew had sure been thine, Thou, thou my Sister, wheresoere thou shine In spangled skies, a cause so like thine own Assist; one family hath both undone, The Father thee, and me the Son, thou sees A suppliant Princes fallen on her knees; Free from aspersions, innocently good; Chang'd but to thee; I'm sure none else have woo'd This day to grief, or life an end shall bring, Pitty a Lover. Hip. Thou Almighty King Of Gods canst thou so mildly see, so mildly hear Her wickednes? if now the Heavens be clear, When wilt thou thunder? let the troubled air Now run on heaps, and day a Vizard wear. May the reversed Stars now backwards run. And what dost thou, thou the irradiate Sun Behold thy Grandchilds lusts? for shame lay by Thy beams, and into utter darkness fly. And why art thou idle Spectator turn'd Great Jove, the world not yet with lightning burn'd, Thunder at me; let thy quick flame consume Me, I am wicked, and deserve the doom. I've pleas'd my Step-dame, merit I to be Incestuous thought? for this Impiety. Seem'd I most fit? deserves my strictness this? O Women excellent in wickedness! O thou in thy unbounded lusts more wild Than was thy Mother! Shee only defil'd Her self, yet was the wicked theft betray'd By the Prodigious issue which shee had; The doubtfull birth witness'd his Mothers shame With his fierce look, from the same womb thou came Thrice happy are they in their prosp'rous fate Who are by fraud consum'd, destroid by hate; Father I envie thee: this sin, this sin, Is greater then Medeas could have been. Ph. I know our houses Fate; I crave, I know What is forbid, but cannot help it tho, Thee thorough flames, o're rocks; the foaming deep, And heady torrents company I'le keep. Where ere thou goes, there frantick I will be, Behold coy youth, again I kneel to thee. Hi. Keep of, and touch not my chast lims, what now Immodest wretch, wilt thou imbrace me too? Then shall my sword due vengeance take; my hand Wreath'd in her hair, her shameless neck doth bend. Bow-bearing Goddess, never bloud with more Justice was on thy Altars spilt before. Ph. Why now Hippolitus, I have my wish: Thou curst my frenzy; 'bove my hope was this, To perish by thy hand, and chast. Hip. Avaunt, And live; least any thing to thee I graunt, Nor shall this steel, by thee polluted, ere Defile my chaster side by hanging there. What Tanais, what Mæotis, which doth pay His waters tribute to the Pontick sea Can wash me clean? not all great Neptunes flouds Can expiate this crime. O Beasts! O Woods! Nu. Why so dull sulled? now the crime is known Let us plead force and uncompelled own The impious act. Sin is best hid by sinn, Who fear to be accused, should begin. Whether the lewd attempt were ours or his, Since secret, who shall be his witnesses? Help, help, Athenians servants; the obscene Hippolitus is ravishing the Queen; Her with his naked sword he threatneth, And awes her chastity with fear of death. See now he flyes, and by his fearfull speed Hath left his sword, a witness of the deed. First chear the Queen, but let her hair still be Thus torne, and thus disordered as you see. These pregnant testimonies of an act So vile, bear to the City; recollect Your senses; Madam, Why, alas, do you, Afflict your self, and fly the publike view? No Woman ever was from the event Esteem'd immodest, but from the assent. Exeunt. CHORUS. Swift as a tempest doth he fly so fast Cloud-gathering Chorus doth not make such hast A shooting Meteor doth more slowly stream, When rapid winds fan the extended flame. Now may admiring Fame conferr on thee The honour due to all antiquity: For so thy beauty doth all others passe, As Phœbe seemeth fairer then she was, When at the full shee doth her fire combine With meeting horns, and all the night doth shine Blushing she rises, and the lesser starres Doe lose themselves in that great light of hers. The evening star appeareth not more bright When first he ushers in the sable night, Now Hesperus when rising from the main, But in the morning Lucifer again. Nor thou Bacchus for ever young, thy hair Unshorn, and vines wreathed about thy spear, With which thou dost thy sluggish Tigres wound, Thy horned temples with a Mitre bound, Dost his untrimmed locks excell; nor set Thy beauty (Theseus) on too high a rate, Because the rumour generally goes, That Phædra's sister thee 'fore Bacchus chose. Beauty thou most uncertain good, the gay And fading treasure of a short-liv'd day With winged feet how dost thou post away! The scorching heat of summer hath not kil'd So soon, the verdant glory of the field; Ith' middle of the Solstice, when the night Contracts her self, and makes more room for light: As these fair colours that adorn the face Are in a moment gone; no day doth passe But may the ruines of some beauty boast, Form is a fading thing. O! who would trust So frail a good? use it while thou hast power, For time doth steal away, and every houre, Is worse than that which went before, Why lov'st thou deserts? beauty is I'm sure In those untrodden paths, as unsecure If hid from mid dayes heat in woods thou be Loose rings of Naiades will compass thee, Who choicest youths imprison in their streams: And wanton Silvans shall ensnare thy dreams. Or if the Moon thought younger than the old Arcadians from her Starry Orbe behold That she with wonder will be fixed there. Of late she blush'd, nor any clouds appear To vail her naked Lustre, but we grown Sollicitous for th' colour she was on, Our kettles beat against Thessalian spells When besides thee, she had no leasure else; Thou wert her only cause of stay, and shee But stopt her chariot while shee look'd on thee. Let fewer frosts but nip thee, and the rayes Of Phœbus seldomer salute thy face, It will excell the Parian Marble, how That pleasing frown becomes thy manly brow! How grave a Majesty is seated there! Although thy neck might with the Suns compare His flowing tresses on his shoulders spread With which hee's both adorn'd and covered: That rugged front, becoming thee, and those Short curles, which only Nature doth compose Though the most warlike Gods thou mightst defie And from the combate bear the Victory: Though now, while yet a youth thou equallest, Alcides brawnie arms, or Mars his chest. If when thou ridest, Castor never rein'd His Cyllarus with such an even hand. If when thy finger to the loop made fast, With all thy force thou dost thy javelin cast; The Cretans cannot shoot so far, who be Esteemed Masters in Artillery, Or Parthian like, direct thy shafts on high And none return unblouded from the skie; But in her bowels fixt, doe make the bird Thy prey which in the middle region sor'd. Yet (search all ages records for their fate) The fair have seldome proved fortunate. Some milder God protect thee, and may thou Live till thou be deform'd, so aged too. What dare not vexed women do? what snares Shee to entrap the guiltless youth prepares, Her cheeks she doth bedew; her head undresses, And seeks beleef, in her disordered tresses. All guil is com'd by woman, but who's he, That in his face such marks of Majesty Doth bear; his head erected with that state? How like Hippolitus he is! but that His cheeks do such a ghastly paleness wear, And such a filth doth clot his flagging hair. See Theseus self return'd to Earth is there. Finis Actus Secundi. Actus Tertii. Scena Prima. Theseus. To him Nurse. Th. At length returned from nights gloomy coasts And th' Pole which shaddows the imprisond ghosts How light offends mine eies; now is the corn Triptolemusses gift, the fourth time shorn; Four Æquinoctials now hath Libra seen; While I uncertain of my Fate have been, Betwixt the Ills of life and death divided. I Retain'd this part of life, when I did lye Buried my sence remaind. Great Hercules Dragging the dog from hell did finish these Miseries, and brought me thence, but now it wants The prop of strength, my tired courage faints. And my legs tremble; what ado had I To come within the prospect of the skie, From Phlegethons Abyss! the toil did seem Alike to flie from death, and follow him But stay, what sudden out-cryes pierce mine ears? Speak some one: In my gates, complaints, and tears, And sorrow in variety exprest? Indeed fit welcomes for a hellish guest. Nu. Phædra resolves to dye; she doth despise, Our bootless tears, and even now shee dies. Th. What cause of death? why die? now I am come? Nu. Ev'n that doth hasten her untimely doom. Th. Thy doubtful speech some great thing doth presage Speak plainly, whence proceeds so wild a rage? Nu.

Scena Secunda. Theseus. Phædra. Nurse. Servants. O partner of my bed, dost thou receive Me thus? This all the welcome I must have; Lay by this sword; restore my troubled sence, And say, what fury doth perswade thee hence. Ph. Alas great Theseus, by thy Scepter, by The toward hopes of thy Posterity, By thy return, and me now dost permit Me here to die. The. What cause requireth it? Ph. The benefit were lost the cause once known. The. Why none shall hear it but my self alone. Dost thou mistrust thy Husband? never fear My brest will prove a faithful Treasurer. Ph. Conceal thou first, what thou wouldst have conceal'd The. Yet shall all means of dying be withheld From thee. Ph. The willing can't want means. The. Relate, What crime thou with thy death wouldst expiate. Ph. Why that I live. The. Cannot my tears prevail? Ph. That death is welcomest which friends bewail. The. Well she is obstinate; but I will force What she conceals with torments from the Nurse. Load her with ir'ns, stripes shall make her betray What ere she knows. Ph. Now I will tell you, stay. The. Why dost thou turn away thy face, and seek To hide the tears, which trickle down thy cheek? Ph. Thee, thee, Father of gods, and thee from whom Our hours first Originall did come, Dayes brightest Lampe, I call to witness how I neither to his prayers, nor threats did bow, And yet my body did his force sustain, But with my bloud, Ile wash it clean again. The. Say who hath been the ruine of our fame? Ph. One whom thou little thinks. The. Tell me his name, Ph. This sword will tell you, which he left, afeard To be attach'd by the alarum'd guard, The. Oh me! what crimes, what monstrous crimes doe I Behold? rough with the little Imagerie, The Iv'ry hilt with those Illustrious signs, Which glorifie th' Actean Nation shines, But how escaped he? Ph. Why these can say, With what a fearfull speed he fled away. Scena Tertia. Theseus. The. Oh sacred Piety! O King of Gods, And thou who rul'st the second Lot, the floods What rage possest this impious brat? did Greece, Taurus or Colchian Phasis teach him this? His deeds declare his line, and he hath shew'd Whence he first sprung by his degenerate bloud. Those mad Viragos marriage do despise, And weary of their long kept Chastities Turn Prostitutes at last. O cursed root, Which when transplanted bears no better fruit! Yet even they flie Incest; an innate Shame doth keep Natures laws unviolate. Now where's his feign'd austerity, desire To imitate the ancients rude attire, Strictness of manners, gravitie of look? O jugling life, how art thou still mistook? The foulest soul wears the serenest face. The Impudent doth blush, Strife seems at Peace, Sin wears the robes of Piety, Deceit Applaudeth truth, and the effeminate A rigid abstinence doe counterfeit. Thou the fierce Virgin Sylvan wert thou then Reserv'd for this? must thy sins write thee man? And in thy Fathers bed? now on my knees I humbly thanke the carefull Deities That I did kill Antiope: least thou Had'st in my absence forc'd thy Mother too. Fly vagabond to unknown Realms, although Thou to the worlds remotest countries goe, Sever'd from Earth by interposing seas; Or shouldst thou dwell in the Antipodes, Or hide thy self in the obscurest hole, Beyond the Kingdoms of the Northern Pole; The seat of snow and winter left behind, And the cold blasts of that loud-threatning wind; Yet, yet the sword of vengeance should thee find. I will pursue thee every where, search places Remote, Landlock'd, abstuce, confounding mazes, And wayes inexplicable; and where force Cannot arrive, Ile reach thee with a curse. Dost thou know whence I came? great Neptune gave Me Pow'r three times to ask what I would have, And seald his promise by the Stygian floud, Behold how sorrowfull a boon I wou'd. No more let him behold the light, but goe From his wrong'd Father to the Ghosts below. To me thy Son a hated pitty show. This last gift never had bin ask'd, if I Were not oppress'd by such an injury. When in the womb of Hel, where Dis did roar, And threatning Pluto stormed, I forbore. Make good thy promise now, why dost thou stay? Why hast thou still so undisturb'd a Sea? With wind-contracted clouds, put out the light Of Stars, obscure the Heav'ns, and masque the night; Pour out thy Seas, drive all thy Monsters hither, Call from the Deep the waves retired thither. Exit. CHORUS. O Nature Mother to the Gods and Jove Who sway'st the bright Olympus, who doest move The Stars scatterd in their swift Orbe, and force Ev'n those wand'rers to observe a course, And on their hinges turnst the Poles; Why art Thou alwaies busied in the heavenly part? Still ord'ring those Celestiall Forms? why dost Thou take such care that now the winters frost Sould strip the woods, and then again t' adorn, Them with fresh shades; that now the parched corn The rage of the hot Lion should endure, Which the more temp'rate Autume doth mature? But why hast thou, who these dost regulate, And mov'st the Sphears poys'd with their proper weight So little care of man: nor dost provide That good the good, and ill the ill betide. Mortals doe follow the blind-guide of chance Whose hoodwinkt bounty doth the worst advance. The holy perish in the crafty toils Of lust: The Court is governed by wiles. The people love to give the wicked pow'r, And as soon hate whom they doe now adore. Dejected vertue reapeth but a small Reward for doing well; the chaste doe fall Under the curse of want: while potent vice Is crowned for his fam'd Adulteries. Vain Modesty: and empty Fame!—but stay, What doth the breathless Nuncius hast to say, And sadly stopping, what sinister Chance Figures he in his wofull Countenance? Finis Actus Tertii. Actus Quarti. Scena Prima. Nuncius. Theseus. Nun. O the sad Fate of Servants! Why am I The messenger of our calamitie. Th. Speak thy news boldly; custom thou shalt find For all afflictions hath prepard my mind. Nun. My tongue refuses the sad office. The. Say, What fresh Mis-fortunes our declining house oppress? Nun. Ah me, your Son is dead. The. I wept, my Son Long since: now but a ravsher is gone. But speak the manner. Nun. Why as he forsook The City, painting hatred in his look, Away he flieth with redoubled speed, And quickly harnesses his lofty Steeds, Their mettal'd heat, he with the curb allayes, And divers things unto himself he sayes; Curses your throne, oft on your name doth call And fiercely shakes his slackned reins withall; When suddenly the Sea did roar and swell Up to the Stars; not any breathing gale Did crispe the flouds; no thunder tore the air, The Sea it self raised a tempest there. Sicilian Seas are with the South-wind lesse Disturb'd, nor half that fury doe express When Chorus rains, stones tumbling up and down And with white spume doth high Leucates crown. A hill of waves big with a Monster fled Unto the shore to be delivered. Nor is this tempest for the ships prepar'd But for the land, the Sea rolls thitherward With a main speed; nor can we guesse what she Should labour with; what uncouth Prodigie Earth would shew Heaven, a new Cyclas did Rise, Esculapius Temple now was hid, And the famd rocks of Scyron, and with these The land, straightned betwixt two neigh'bring Seas. While these amaz'd we seek, behold the Main Doth roar, and all the rocks resound again; Whose tops are sprinkled with the waves, which he Sucks in, and spouteth forth Vicissively. So through the Ocean as the whirlpool roams A globe of water from his nostrils comes. Anon this mountain bursts, and to the shore Brings something worse, than was our fear before, The Sea doth follow where the Monster lead, And overwhelms the land, we shook with dread. The. What was the shape of this prodigious beast? Nun. He like a Bul erects his seagreen crest, And virid front: tosses his mane, his ears Pricks up, and party-coloured horns he bears: Such as might both the conduct of the herd Become, and the Seas Issues he appear'd: His eies do sparkle, and he vomits flame: His neck curl'd like the Ocean whence he came, His open nostrils snort aloud: his chest And deawlap in tenacious Moss are drest: His ample sides with red are spotted, then Ends in a Monster; his huge slimie train Drag'd after him, in farthest Seas those Whales Have such which swallow up the obvious sails. Earth trembles with the load: astonish'd fly The scatter'd cattle, nor are followed by Th' affrighted Pastor, beasts the forrest clear; And all the Huntsmen are half dead with fear. Only Hippolitus unmov'd remains, And his amazed Steeds with straighter reins, Encourag'd by his wel-known voice retains. Tow'rds Argos lyes a steep and craggy way, Which all the neighb'ring Ocean doth survey: Here this vast bulk doth whet himself, and act In jest first, what he doth intend in fact. But when he felt his rage increase, and had Now long enough with his own fury plaid; Away he flies, scarce any print remains, And just before the trembling chariot stands. Your Son nere changeth colour, but doth rise With angry looks, and thus aloud he cries; I shall not easily be afraid of this; To conquer Bulls hereditary is. But straight his disobedient Steeds, their load Did carry thence, and having mist the road They follow'd as their fury lead, and ore Uneven rocks the jolting Chariot bore. He, as a skilfull Pilot taketh care In a rough Sea to keep his Vessell fair, And with his art beguiles the waves; doth guide His horses, now he draws their mouths aside With the strain'd bit, and now the scourge he uses; Nor all the way his foul companion loses: Now side by side, he keeps an equall pace: Now right before; and terror brings each wayes. But here the flight doth end; just in the way Standeth the horned Monster of the Sea. Th' affrighted Steeds then lost all rule, and strove To run down headlong from the rocks above; Rising before they cast your Son, who, as He fell, within the reins entangled was, Which wound about his body, and the more He struggled held him faster then before. They with the empty Chariot run, this known As their fear guides; commanded now by none So feeling a strange weight, and scorning that Day was committed to a counterfeit, Hurried through the air, the Chariot of the Sun Shook from his seat the unskilfull Phaeton His blood besmears the fields: his head the rocks Doth beat, and Brambles tear away his locks; Sharp stones dis-figure his fair face, and by Whole troops of wounds, his hapless form destroy. The swift wheels drag, his dying limbs at last His corps on an erected stake is fast. Struck through the middle of his groin, a while He staid his chariot fixed on a pile; His steeds made a short halt, but quickly they At once both broke their Master, and delay. Then briers and thorns his half-dead body tear, And evr'y bush, a piece of him doth weare. His wofull servants are disper'st to find, Where his bloud marks the way, he thus dis-joynd Hippolitus; the howling Beagles goe In guest of their dissever'd Master too. Nor all their diligence as yet compleats, The Corps, is this the honour beautie gets? Who now, Partner, and heir unto a Crown, As bright as any Constellation shone; Is gather'd to his Urn in peeces now O Nature, but too prevalent art thou. What tyes of bloud dost thou on Parents lay, Which we, even against our wills, obey! Whom dead I wish'd, now dead I weep for, Nun. None. Enough can weep, for what themselves have done. The. Mortals abide no greater curse, than when Constrain'd to wish what they unwish agen. Nun. Why do you weep, if you retain your hate? The. Not that he's dead, but that I caus'd his fate. Exeunt. CHORUS. How fickle is the state of man! the poor Doe not the fiercest storms of chance endure; She strikes them with her lightest stroaks, they be Crownd with content though in obscuritie; A homely cottage doth the eyelids close With a secure and undisturb'd repose. Those lofty towers neer neighbours to the skie Receive the East and South-winds battery; The rage of the tempestuous Boreas, and The showr-accommpanied Chorus stand. The humble valley is but rarely strook With thunder, when great Caucasus hath shook And Ida trembled. Jove himself afraid Of the seal'd heavens, hath earth his refuge made. Plain homely roofs, and vulgar habitations Have no extraordinary alterations, When Kingdoms totter, on their craz'd foundations Fortune doth flie with an uncertain wing, And none can boast he hath her in a string. He who redeemed from eternall night Again enjoyes the comfort of the light, Now weepeth his return from Hell, and here Meeteth a greater cause of grief than there. Pallas, whom we to reverence are bound That Theseus free'd from the Stygian sound Again reveiws the Heav'ns; chaste Virgin thou Art not beholding to thy Uncle now: The greedy Tyrant hath his number still. What voice of weepings this? what bloody Scene With a drawn sword prepares the frantick Queen. Finis Actus Quinti. Actus Quintus. Theseus, Phædra, Chorus, Servants. Th. What fury doth possess thee? why this sword Wherefore about a body so abhor'd Are these complaints and tears? Ph. On me, on me Pour forth thy wrath hard-hearted Deitie; On me let loose thy Monsters, whatsoere Tethys doth in her hidden bosome bear: Whatever do in farthest Seas remain Embrac'd by the unstable Ocean. Oh Theseus ever fatall to thine own! Now thy returne thy Father, and thy Son, Have purchas'd with their lives; still thou thy house Destroy'st with Love or hatred of thy Spouse; Oh my Hippolitus, and doe I view Thee thus? and must I be the Author too? What Scinis, what Procrustes, what new kind Oh double-visag'd Cretan bulls, confin'd Unto Dædalian Labyrinths, scattered Thy limbs? Oh! whither is thy beauty fled? Whither those eyes my stars! what, dead? Oh stay, A while, and hear me what I have to say. My language shall be chast; this sword shall thee Into my bosome stab'd, revenge of me, And death shall make me be Phædra no more, As my impiety did once before; Then will I follow thee through all the streams Of Hel, through Styx, and channels fil'd with flams, Let me appease thy Ghost, here take this hair, Which thus from the disordered fleece I tear. Though in our wills unequall, we may try An equall fate; if chaste, to Theseus dye: If not, unto thy love; what shall I climbe My Husbands bed defil'd by such a crime? Or was this sin undone, only that I, The abused Vindicator should enjoy Of an unviolated Chastity? O Death, the only cure of Love, who best A broken Modesty recementest To thee I fly: open thy quiet brest. Athenians hear, and thou a Father worse Than I a Stepdame, what I did rehearse Was false and wicked; forg'd in my distracted Bosome: thou'st punished; a sinne unacted. By my incesluous guilt, guiltlesse and chast He fel, now thy deserved praise thou hast. This sword shall pierce my impious brest, and bring My bloud to thy wrong'd Ghost an offering. What thou shouldst doe now thou hast lost thy son, Learn of a Step-dame: Flie to Acheron. The. You dark jaws of Avernus, and you caves Of Tenarus, with you forgetfull waves Of Lethe, gratefull to the wretched, you Dull lakes assist to overwhelm me too; Load me with everlasting plagues, come now You monsters of the deep; whatever thou, Proteus hast hidden in the utmost wombe Of the Ocean, and ev'n that Ocean come, And me glory'ng in such a crime convey To the dark bosome of the profound sea, And thou too prone a Father to my wrath, Now I deserve to dye, by a strange death; I have dispers'd my Son, and while afraid To leave a false offence unpunished, Acted a true; what fourth lot can I try? Heaven, Hell, the sea by my Impietie Are fill'd, already in each portion known Am I: Was my returne for this alone? The way to light unstopt to shew me these Sad and ingeminated obsequies? Widdow'd and childles I that might at once Kindle two fun'rall piles, my wives and sons? O thou to whom this dismal light I ow, Return me back unto those shades below. But, Impious, I doe now in vaine preferre Forsaken death; cruell Artificer, Who findest out new waies of bloud, and death, Now finde a curse thy sin which equalleth. Pines humbled to the earth by force, at their Release, my body shall in peeces teare, Or I will jump from Scyrons rocks. I've seen Worse judgements, what their sufferings have been Girt with a mote of fire. I know what paines, And future mansion for my self remaines. Make roome you sinfull Ghosts; thy endlesse toile Upon these shoulders lay, and rest the while Faint Sicyphus: let that false river slip, When almost caught from this deluded lip. Let Tityus vulture leave him, and for food Prey on my Liver still, to paine renew'd. Rest my Pirithons Father, while I, bound Unto thy Wheele, keep the perpetuall round. Gape Earth, receive me Hell, receive me: this A juster voyage for me thither is; My Son I follow: fear not thou, who sway'st That Ghostly Empire; my intent is chast. In thy Æternall house receive me then, Now never to escape from thence agen. The Gods are not so much as mov'd with prayer; But when I aske a crime, how quick they are! Cho. Now pay the rites of fun'rall, and mourne, These limbes you see so misrably torne; You will have time enough to weep. The. O bear Hither those reliques I esteeme so deare. Give me that burthen, and those limbs, but too Irreverently gathered by you. Art thou Hippolitus? thou art, the deed I doe confess, and I thy Parricide, Least I should sin but once, and that alone, Did call my Father when I slew my Son. See his Paternall Legacy. O rage Which thus unproppest my declining age! Let me embrace these limbs, and what is yet Remaining in my bosome cherish it; Joyn these dissected members and digest Those parts in order which be thus displac'd, Here put his right hand, here his left, once skill'd In moderating of those reins it held. This mark in his left-side, I know how great A part have I to weep unfound as yet. Hold out my trembling hands, and you restrain My thirsty cheeks your ample showrs of rain, While to my Son I count his limbes, and mold His body new. This peece no shape doth hold At all, with wounds so mangled 'tis unknown What part it is, but sure I am 'tis one. Here in this void, although not proper place It shall be laid: Is this that Heavenly face Humbled a Stepdames pride? that Beauty come To this? O Gods how cruell is your doom! Oh bloody fury! to thy Father thus Com'st thou, and by my wish Hippolitus? Here take my Sires last gift that I should bear Thee oft; mean while wee'l burn these members here Open the morning Court, and with loud cryes Let all the Town the fun'rall solemnize. Look you to th'Royall Pile; search you about The Fields to find what yet is wanting out, Give her the buriall of a ditch, where laid, May earth lye heavie on her Impious head. Exeunt. FINIS. DIVERSE SELECT POEMS. By the same Author. On an old ill-favoured Woman, become a young Lover. Love me! Heaven bless me. Hadst thou told me all The common miseries, which can be fall A man, to make him wretched; I had met Them, and embrac'd them with a youthfull heat, Rather then heard thee talke of Love; this newes Is worse then all the plagues the Gods can us, To punish blacke offenders with; to thee Want and continuall sickesse, blessings be. Sure thou dost now like beggars, who to crave Take a delight, though they may nothing have: For I can nere beleeve, thou canst acquaint Thy hopes, with expectation of a graunt. Be thine owne Judge, or call thy partiall glasse To witness; canst thou finde in all that Masse Of monstrous ugliness, one peece that can Render thee fit for the most sinful man, If all the rest were answerable? no, Thou may'st securely boast that none can show So full a harmony, no part of thine Can at his fellows richer form repine, Nor can they for Supremacie contest, When ev'ry part is worst, and none is best. Some, when Pandora's boxe was op'ned doubt, That thou wert all those plagus which thronged out. And most agree, as ev'ry gen'rous God A sev'rall ornament on her bestow'd, The sportive Deities have giv'n to thee Each a particular deformity; Jove gave thee an imperious mind; his Queen Made thee a scold, and gave thee tongue and spleen: Sol tan'd thy skin. Iris did paint thy face: Hermes taught theft: Saturn gave length of dayes, God Momus gave thee a repining soul: Phœbe to keep thee chaste, hath made thee foul; Yet (it seems) Venus whom thou dost adore, Enrag'd at that hath made thy will a whore; And Mulciber, who would not be behind His courteous wife, gave thee a halting mind. But by what chance into the world thou fell None can conceive under a miracle. Thy Mother (hadst thou had one) at thy birth Had frantick run as soon as brought thee forth: The trembling Mid wife from her shaking hands Had let thee fall, killd in thy swathing bands. The timely zeale else of the standers by Had rid the world of such a Prodigy; Or had'st thou, by their feare from present death A while preserv'd, drawn a contemned breath, None would have fatherd thee, nor had'st thou bin Esteem'd the lawlesse progeny of sinne, And of the people. Spurnd from each ones blood Thou so had'st perished for want of food. But thou'rt no humane seed, thy shapelesse age Allowes thee not of mortall Parentage. Yet 'twould almost perswade me to beleeve That (if thou be a woman) thou art Eve: Onely I think man might have stood till now, If Eve had been no hansomer than thou; For 'tis not time or age could change thee thus; Thou wert by Nature made so leperous. I rather think Jove did himselfe transforme To woe the Earth, and got thee in a storme; Or else some grave, fruitfull with dead mens bones, Hath teem'd the off-spring of her Skeletons. Thou art of such a dirty mol'd; a thing, Already so like earth, the grave can bring, No change to thy complexion. I dare sweare, The Wormes would scorn to touch thee wert thou there. Thou'rt a meer Chaos, which I am content To grant that nature for a Woman meant; But either she forgot, or else her store Enriching other Beauties, made thee poore, And of necessity she left thee thus; Some parts defective, some superfluous, And others so misplac'd, Poets would sweare, Jove got thee on Calisto when a Beare; And that the suddennesse of her translation, Gave her no time to lick thee into fashion; And I am halfe perswaded, thou dodst hope, Some wealthy dowry from the skies should drop: For if thou wilt be marry'd, thou hast neede, To have a heav'nly Marriage-good indeede; No temp'rall blessings ever were of force, To countervaile so horrible a curse. What madman dost thou thinke would give consent To cast himself away for thy content. Why this is worse. So would one death suffice; Thus, never dead, continually he dyes. For when thou opes thy sore, and dost relate, Like a curst shrew the rigour of thy fate, Telling what slames are in thy bosom bred, A Feaver entertaines him in his bed: If thy wan lookes for pitty seem to call, Into a deep consumption he doth fall; And when thy lab'ring eyes bring forth a floud Of gore, for teares, he gets the flixe of bloud: When thy rude cough doth shake each aged limbe, An Ague, or the Palsie shaketh him. Then if from thy pale Lips he drink a kiss, Without an Antidote he poyson'd is; But if he doe the Act, he doth mistrust, He's damb'd for dealing with a Succubus; Besides 'tis odds that he the P? doth get, Although thou have them not with meere conceit; And for the Plague, there's none will doubt, but he In a full measure hath it, who hath thee. Now if thou knowest any man, who pleases To marry such a portion of diseases, Take him, for I'le be sworn, if e're I doe it The certainty of Heav'n must woe me to it. What should I doe with thee; unless that I Durst shew thee somewhere to get money by? And then I doe beleeve, thy tongue might come To save me the expences of a drum; But when they had so foule a Monster view'd, Who must appease the frighted multitude? What must I doe, when ev'ry Clowne shall sweare, I raise the Div'l, and am a Conjurer? When by my sufl'rings cheated, I shall neede Perswade my selfe, that it is so indeede: Confess the accusation true, and tell The Judge, thou art not onely the Dev'l, but Hell? Durst they looke on, in truth 'twere pretty sport To see thy cheeks enameled with dirt, And yellow, when thy hollow eyes in red. And white, are gorgeously apparelled; Never Envy Tysiphone; thy haire May with the Gorgons snaggy locks compare, And can (for ought I know) change men to stone; I ne're durst look what colour it was on: Thy long and beaked nose, offended with The neighbourhood of such a tainted breath, Doth drop into thy mouth; belike a Rhewme So salt might season it; though not perfume: Thy teeth (too weak a guard) for to oppose The constant motion of thy tongue (God knowes) All in griefes Liv'ry black, as if they mournd For their departed Fellowes, are adorn'd. Then thy hulch backe, splay foot, and beetle browes I passe, almost afraid to think of those; Nor dare I speak thy name, no more than once The Jewes durst doe their Tetragrammatons. All generally is nought, for though there be Some few things, which are simply good in thee; Yet those blind Pearles, those bloud-shot rubies in Thine eyes, that golden Ore upon thy skin; Thy sable teeth made of unpolish'd jet, Are all like jewels in a Dunghill set: And I to pitty thee shall be inclind, Give me these gems, the dunghill left behind. An Ale-match. Now are they set; by this time is the round Begun, and their ambitious cups are crownd; The health is nam'd the Kings, for the like good Subjects thought that would breed the purest bloud: 'Twas a shrewd argument they should be maim'd, When the first blow thus at the head was aim'd. Nothing too much for's Majesty they thought; Nor could their loves be limm'd in a small draught, They were resolv'd to burne the stream of Fate, And with whole pots, cement his broken state. A deluge the old sinfull world did cleanse, And they (by like) tri'd that authentique means. But with a different successe, for then Th' offended Gods destroy'd both beasts and men. When this prepostrous floud of theirs opprest Only the man, and multipli'd the beast. Thus having rear'd the Standard of the King They shortly after fell to mustering. And first unto this desp'rate service presse, Like carefull Souldiers, their own Mistresses. I doe beleeve they had a plot, to prove Whether worse drunkards made Bacchus or Love. But now they found, consulting on the case, Women were nothing if without their glasse. So is their copie changed, and they took A harder volume, but a lesser book. I know not what temptation might be i'nt, But sure they spoild their eies with the small print. Often they read it, nor a time could find To leave, till seeing double made them blind 'Twas wonderfull to see the Virgins Mothers: Their pregnant healths delivered of others. Fruition's the first born, they cannot scape But their unbridled fancies act a rape. Sure they were bashfull, or the Ladies coy, That only in their drink they could enjoy. Now their conceits are swell'd, and they will give No credit unto Poets, but beleeve Jove courted the Acrysian maid of old, In showrs of Nectar, rather then of Gold. They'r bold to thinke Daphne had never shrunke The Love-sick God had he bin half so drunke With any gen'rous liquor, as with pride, He was before, or Love when her he spide. Had lack'd a tree till now; the Virgin had The guerdion not of wit, but drink bin made. The next is to love me, but in that case, Who could, beyond my understanding was Nor was I much inquisitive, I know What they did drink, no matter then to who. Besides, 'twas plain, who could affect such strange Creatures as they, were then must needs love change Well they goe round in riddles, every pot Was woven now into a Gordian knot, Which they like the great Conquerour divide, And never look how they should be untide. Nor can they thinke but he was sharpned well, When this prompt sword fulfill'd the Oracle, And so, after his Asian conquests, shew'd In being drunke a peece of gratitude. By this time the aspiring juyce doth fume Into their brains, and they condemn the room, With those internall vapours almost choak'd They aske the reason why the chamber smok'd. The helpless windows, and the door in vain By turns are shut, and opened again. The remedy was nearer, had each one Clos'd but his mouth a while it had been gone. But they would lose no time, and now you'd think Their flaming eyes had suck'd those seas of drink; For big with light, they seem'd so many Suns Their faint light dimn'd with exhalations. Now are they scatter'd, every one now chooses Another station which he straight refuses, And so the third; their restless bodies walking, Like the Egyptians in the darknes stalking. Yet as a Lover from his Mistris forc'd (By order of the dance a while divorc'd) Moves slowly, and his speaking eie forbears To guide his feet, and kindly follows hers; But then again with winged speed doth take That hand he was constrained to forsake. So they divided by the envious fume, Doe sadly wander up and down the room But summon'd by some friendly name, fly hither And jointly celebrate the health together; At last these grosser vapours are disperst And quit those parts they troubled at the first; Yet the more subile spirits still remain Working insensibly upon the brain. Encourag'd thus they re-inforce the fight, And the room cleer'd, they cleer the table straight; And for the suddainer dispatch, they by A quaint device, encrease the company; Three multiply to six, while ev'ry one Is by two adversaries set upon: Now this, and now the other they assault Like skillfull Beagles, never at a fault; But still who endeth doth again begin, Their cups dancing a perfect Mattachin. They barr all tedious Lectures; 'tis decreed That there they only fluent stiles should read, And without pausing if a peece of cake Did not by chance a breathing Comma make, While 'twas a chewing; for Tobacco is No point of drinke, but a Parenthesis. But now at length they to a full one come, Each man resolving on a voyage home. They pay their reckoning, yet it seems they staid (As by the sequel prov'd) till they were paid. Still there remain'd for every man a pot, Which they like Foulers ram down after th' shot. Now these mingled with half a pint of sack A prettie peece of Conjuration make; Tis all divided into three times three, And each glasse loaden with a family, Which having swallow'd once, you might have seen 'um Quite altered; their homes were now within 'um They talk no more of parting now, but call For a fresh bale of pots, and roundly fall To their old game, I thinke 'twas In and In For they could find no passage out agen. The room was now a Conjurers Circle, and The pots and Pipes for Mystick figures stand; To one another they Magicians were, And their discourses charms to keep them there. Marry their Host must be the Devill, for he Was truly glad of their Impitie, And most officious in his malice lends 'em A boy-like Mephostophiles to attend 'em Whom they keep in perpetuall motion, still Emploid either to empty, or to fill. For now they'd brought their bodies to that pass That they like Mountebanks with ev'ry glass Run themselvs through: they look'd like unbreech'd guns A scowring, whence the tainted water runs In the same quantity, and doth not wast A jot, tho chang'd in colour, and in tast; Cut into humane figures, I have seen Some water-works have very like them been: So were the Belials tubs, nor they in Hell Ere met with vessels more insatiable; And sure the Poets meant that they were ty'd To give a drunkard drink, till he deny'd. I could not chuse but smile at the old Fable How Hercules did cleanse Augeas Stable; Me thought with that, and them, as the case stood There was a kind of a similitude. You've have heard of the fam'd river that pursues With eager streams the flying Arethuse, And grown impatient of the sad divorce Doth under Earth and Seas a passage force Till she at length is caught, and the fight done, Their frindly waters in one channell run; Take any two of them, and the whole chase Most excellencly represented was. Of Xerxes Armie, Histories relate How they dranke up whole Rivers at a bait, An easie matter for all them to doe; But who by drinking ere created new? Had but the fire in Tower-street hapned there, And they bin peece-meal blown into the air, They had gone nigh to quench it; for an hour At least, their drink would have maintain'd a showr. Mine Host hearing them call for it so fast Came up in a great feare himselfe at last, And seeing all was well, again retir'd; For he beleev'd the chamber had been fir'd. By this time they had made more Ale away Than would have serv'd Faustus to 's load of hay: 'Twould have struck all the gifted Brethren dumb And taught the Bishops how to silence 'um. Yet still their feav'rish appetites encrease The more they drink, they'r satisfy'd the lesse. I'le undertake, had but the Fens been such, They would have drain'd them better than the Dutch. Ten more of their own humour, and in one Halfe year the Navy would be uselesse grown; The King (God bless him) could no shipping lack, The narrow Seas they fordable would make; And think it nothing too. They three had Seas Within them, farre more dangerous than these: So rough, the Pilot, Reason could nor steere, But he himselfe did suffer shipwrack there: They'd made a perfect Microcosme of man; Their bladders were the Midland Ocean; Their bellies the Ægæan Sea, the whiles Their floting entrailes seeme the thick-set Isles: Their troubled brests the Adriatick, and Their mote hearts like Sea-girt Venice stand. Or if you will ascend more high, their brain Swims like the frozen Sea dissol'd again: And their benighted understandings looke Like Green Land men by winter overtook. Yet some who saw them thus diguised, say, They were all a meere Terr' incognita; Nor without cause; well might they be unknown To them, who to themselves were strangers grown. Had they been catechized then 'tis thought That the first question would have put them out; For any thing they of their own Names knew The Minister might have baptiz'd them new. They talk'd like men asleepe, of this and that, And whilst a speaking oft, forgot of what: The rest bound up in frost you would have thought, And the next thaw come to have heard it out. It would have run a good Gramarian mad, To tell how many parts of speech they had, The Noise at Babel was each whit as good, And I beleeve, farre better understood. For they had a confusion too, and worse Than that of tongues, of th' Intellective Powers. In language they were English all, but than In understandings all Ebrician. What is't a clock? sayes one, another cries, You're in the right; with all my heart replies The third; all answ'ring so farre from the matter That mortar brought instead of brick was batter. Yet all this while, they drink, and sometimes take, A whole pot meerely, for variety sake. A whole pot meerly for vari'ty sake. The Boy calls up his Master, and he swears That they are Papists all, and now at prayers; He thinkes their great and lesser Cups are strung In order, 'stead of Beads, upon their tongue: He fancies an Ave Mary in each glass, And ev'ry pot a Pater Noster was. But now both pots and glasses they forbore, Their treach'rous heads (alas) would bear no more, But droop like Tulips overcharg'd with wet, The sleepy Poppy, or the Violet; Yet so much sense even now in them remaines, They break the Weapons that had crack'd their brains. Now they sit still, and not a word doth pass, Like the Disciples of Pythagoras. To do their Mother-tongue a peece of right Their tongues that clip'd it now were silent quite. Mine Host aware of this dumb show doth bring Vp in an Antimasque the reckoning, In which I doe beleeve (were the truth known) He oft saw double and told two for one; But when he drew it, he did much mislike The fallacy of that Arithmetique. Well, they discharge him, or to say more true He first discharg'd himself, and then them too; For all this while they sate like stocks; the Room, It self a quicker motion did assume: For that ran like the Heavens Circular, And them we might to the fixt Stars compare When they sate still, or reeling too and fro Their doubtfull legges like the Errata goe; And stand for Hieroglyphicks of the Sunn's Strange course, that goes so many wayes at once. But now I at a ne plus ultra am, Nor know I how they to their lodgings came; For when they thought of going, then their feet, To speak the truth, had clean forgotten it. On a Talkative, and Stammering Fellow. Thou thine own Pillory, who for thy eares Dost crop thy tongue, and talk'st in Characters; Who words epitomizest, and canst tell How to divide a Monosyllable; Thou that dost quavers speak, and such as are But evill Language, and worse Musique farre, So that thy pleasant Auditors oft make Wagers, thou learnedst of an Owl to speak, Or else that Nature when thou wert but young; Ty'd a perpetuall Ague to thy tongue. How Mountain like thou labour'st to give birth Either to Nonsense, or bring nothing forth? In troth I can but pitty thee that dost Endure such throwes for thy tongues female lust; And wish thy mouth had been so Cannon bor'd, Thou should'st not need a Midwife for each word. Rather than undergoe the grievous pains That wait on such a costive utterance, I would advise thee purge, and aptly vent It backwarks, Excrement with Excrement; Or with thy Pincers pluck thy teeth that doe So ravenously bite thy words in two. I'd scorn to eat a Morsel with those base Grinders that hinder'd me from saying Grace; Would give a generall defie to meat, Ere mine own words so like a Coward eat. Thou chew'st them so, they stick for th' most part twixt Thy teeth, and we must stay till them thou pick'st. When thorough that blind maze of signes and sound, Which so do the intelligence confound, They should conduct us to thy meaning, thou In th'middle of the lab'rinth breakst the Clew. As 'tis, thy tongue is fit for nothing else But to pronounce the Devil's Oracles, And 'twould for that be excellent, all the skil Being to leave the meaning doubtfull still, For which thy canting speech is made so fit, 'Twould pose the Devill himself t'interpret it. It sounds like the tongues Chaos, that same rude Matter that did all Languages include Ere words received form, when there was neither French, Dutch or English, but all heap'd together. Nature in thee did overact her part, And so struck dumb her Adversary Art. Let others boast their Mother Tongue, but she Hath giv'n the Mother of all tongues to thee. Thy speech is much like Bullion that's made fit For any stamp, but hath receiv'd none yet: Though't may to each particular relate, 'Tis when thou speak'st it neither this nor that; But being coined by thy hearers eares, To ev'ry Countrey man his own appeares, As if (not to doe th' Holy Ghost that wrong) He with the cloven foot had cleft thy tongue. 'Tis heathen language, neither circumcis'd After th' old Law, nor after th' new baptiz'd; Hath neither mark whereby it may be known, Nor so much as denomination. 'Tis thought thy Ancestors did fetch their rise From th'time that words were into Colonies Divided, and did band themselves together In sev'rall tongues as birds do of a feather; When men by their example did disperse Plantations thorough the whole Vniverse, Then thy Forefathers did directly fall Vnder no one, but border'd upon all. Hence 'tis that one did thy discourse extoll, And styled it, the Vniversall soule Of Language, as being mingled with that art 'Twas All in All, and All in every part. Hence 'tis thou talk'st such Linsey-Woolsy, and Dost in one word make rodes into each Land, While ev'ry syllable in th' utt'rance fights For thus invading one anothers Rights, And Nature to preserve the publique quiet, Them with the Stocks doth punish for their riot. Thy tongue (and not unwittily perhaps) One likened to th' Almesbasket filld with scraps, It feeds our ears with mix'd and broken words, Iust like the poor with bits from sev'rall boards. Swifter than thought it runneth through each Clime, Visits all Nations in a point of time, And whence the greater miracle doth rise Although so great a trav'ler never lyes. But since mens eares are not so given to roame, 'Twere better that thy tongue too stay'd at home. For as the palate cann't distinguish 'twixt The sev'rall tasts of liquours that are mixt; No more our eares while thou retain'st a spice Of ev'ry tongue can know thy various voice. A suite made up of patterns were both fit To emblemise thy speech, and cloth thy wit; 'Tis like an over busie servant, who With too much hast his errand doth outgoe; Bels jangled without order, or a Clock That strikes at random might be thought to mock Thee; methinks ev'ry word thou dost pronouce Sounds as sev'n Dev'ls spoke in thee at once. Had Noahs Ark upon some Rock been split, When all the Living were embark'd in it, Those many strange, and disagreeing cryes, Could not have made a more confused noise. I oft have walk'd th' Exchange, and must confess The Buzz of all that concourse was both lesse, And lesse perplexed, better than thee I cou'd What every man said there have understood. What a learn'd Di'logue would betwixt you pass Hadst thou like Bala'm but a speaking Asse? Thou hast so rugged and so wilde a phrase 'Tis like a Book stuft witb Et cæteras, Which the Press up in cunning knots doth tye, And yet dissolv'd just nothing signifie, Wert thou but musically giv'n, by thee How rarely Barnaby would chanted be, When as the Drunkard might take all along, His reeling measures from thy stagg'ring tongue? I wonder thou wilt give a beast the head So much, and know'st it such a stumbling jade. Alas consider that men use to stay And rest awhile, who travail a rough way. For mine own part, I'm willing to apply My self to th' study of Cheirology, And talk with thee by signes, so thoul't command Thy tongue give place to th'Rhet'rick of thy hand; But thou'rt (I doubt) too greedily inclin'd To quit so many trades 't expresse thy mind; Besides 'tis naturall to thy disease, Neither to let men speak nor hold their peace. And (a plague take thee) speech he little needs, Who is so plainly spoken by his deeds. Vpon Lucretia Now the chast Matron being left alone, Had leasure to consider what was done; And though the sinfull act committed were Against her wil, she could not chuse but fear Th' uncertaine voice of Fame, which doth but prize Suspected vertue as apparent vice. Then melting into tears, O Gods! saith she, Is this the best reward for Chastity? Or do you hate that vertue, that we must Be forced when we will not yield, to Lust? What balm, what comfort have you to asswage My furious forrow? miserable age! When most doe willingly this sin commit; And such as would cannot live free from it. Then did she wring her hands, and tear her hair, Sighing her body almost into ayr; So true a grief had been enough to make Her innocent, although she did partake Of Tarquin's guilt. But now at length she dries Those wealthy pearls from her o'rcharged eyes, And with a calmer look, these teares, saith she, Are booteless; Childish sorrow cannot free Me from mens censures: Something must be done To expiate his crime, lest thought mine own. There did she stay awhile, and with her eyes Cast down, as studying on her enterprise, By chance she did the Tyrants Ponyard find, Which he at his departure left behind. She took it up, and a sad smile did show Her joy for her approaching overthrow. Yet will I triumph over shame, and by My death (quoth she) confirm my Chastity; And thou polluted steel, which once didst force Me to the breach of wedlock, shalt divorce Me now for ever; then she said no more, But acting what she had resolv'd before, Drove the continu'd wound unto her heart, The noble Spirit hastned to depart; Perhaps it was affraid it might defile It selfe by staying with that Flesh awhile. The Power of Love Poets made the a God, and Love, if thou Be Deify'd, make me a Poet now; Then will I sing thy praises, and reherse Thy feared name th'rough the wide Vniverse; Some faithful grove, where no close spy discovers The strict embraces of enjoying Lovers, Shall be thy Temple, hallow'd by my prayers. The cheerfull Birds shall be the Choristers, A Poet shall be Priest, and I will bring My wounded heart to be the offering; My body shall be th' Altar, and mine eyes Shall feed the flame that burns the Sacrifice. Then in thy powerfull name I will all jars Compose, and once more free the Earth from wars. Beasts hunting after prey shall then grow tame, Arrested by the accents of thy name; The Lyon then shall kisse the Lamb, and keep Him harmless, while the Wolf defends the sheep; The Bear and Dog be friends; the Crocadile Shall weep no more when as he would beguile; The Sirens tempting voice shal then have power Onely to calm the waves, not to devoure, And ravish'd with the tune the rising Seas Shall dance for joy, not gape sor carkasses. The Turtles shall leave off their conrtship, and As listning to the musick silent stand, But at the close of ev'ry melting strain, Approving what they hear, shall Bill again. The Virgin Phœnix shall beleeve a Mate A fitter means than death to propagate; The Nightingale shall change her note, &amp; mourn No longer for her Rape, but for her scorn; The Loving Pelican shall spend her blood More freely to preserve her Mate than Brood; The Salamander feel a hotter fire: The Gennet shall not have the Wind his sire. Rivers to kisse th'embracing banks shall stay, Till forced by the upper streams away, And then with a sad murmure forward creep As loth to intermingle with the deep. All Trees shall grow like Palmes, by two and two, And fade at once as they together grew; None shall be barren, all (thus match'd) shall bear Some gratefull issue to the kindly year. Stil with fresh Verdure shall the Earth be clad, And yield encrease for what she never had, Scorning by her spruce Lover to be found At any time with wither'd Chaplets crown'd. Children, whose tender age as yet affords Them but the Liberty of half-clip'd words, Shall learn the Dialect of Love, and break Their mindes by acting what they cannot speak; While forty Ecchoes (who have onely tongue For that,) shall bear the burthen of my song, And taking it from one another bear Thy praises thorough either Hemisphære, Till the whole Earth with joinct consent approve All things are subject to the power of Love. The new Niobe. Mercy great Love, and hence I'l swear My self a vassall to thy Shrine, And ev'n when th' art raging here My verse shall speak that rage divine, Though my insufferable smart Perswades me thou a Fury art, So thou'lt but cast one other dart. Why should she still unmoved stand, And set at nought thy power and thee, Defying thy dead-doing hand; Her language than her soul more free? While thou her prophanations heares, And, as if thou had'st lost thy eares As well as eyes, to strike forbeares? What was my over-active crime? What Blasphemies have I ere spoke, Which could to Heav'n so nimbly clime, And your quick Fury thence provoke? Perhaps I call'd thee boy, and blind; Scorn'd Love, doth not she bear that minde? Why then in punishment not joyn'd? Are Women privileg'd alone Securely to do ill? or can One trespas be less monstrous grown In Woman than it is in Man? No, no, I see that thou hast sworn We both shall pay the price of scorn With diff'rent passions overborn. Yet am I us'd no worse by thee Than the great ruler of the day; I Love a Stone, and he a Tree; Shee by her prayers became a Bay, And mine like Niobe is grown By often weeping to a Ston, But chang'd by my tears not her own. Love, thou art just, and tis but fit She should into a Statue Freeze, Who in her self the hopes of it Destroys, as well as she that sees Her ofspring, which she glories in Slaine by her pride; but for that sin A Mother too she might have been. Gaine in Losse Away, fond Boy away, What tempts thee for to stay Hov'ring about my brest? Thou canst not hope to sway Whereas disdaines possest With such an interest. And Honour'l not alow That thou should'st lower bow, When daily Conquests post Afresh to Crown thy Brow, And every shaft almost A heart or two can boast. Yet if thou entr'st here, By thine own power I swear, All glory thou must quit; No Bow nor Quiver bear, But unto Scorn submit Thy self an Anchorite. Thus spake Almanna, and Cupid smil'd To think how much she was beguil'd, Then shot, but spite of all his art His blow the little Archer spoil'd: Out flew the Golden-headed dart, But could not pierce her armed heart. Almanna laugh'd, and the God cry'd With fear of whipping terrfi'd, And grieved for his broken Bow; No hope of comfort he espi'd, So that his tears, which seem'd to flow, If not then blind had made him so. Another such he would have bought, But there was none, and if without He went, or this should broken bring Venus would know, that very thought Fresh flouds from the poor boy did wring Lest she should whip him with the string. But th'Virgin not of Marble made All means to comfort him assay'd, And oft his blubber'd cheeks did dry. At last, with pitty overswai'd, She promis'd him that he should lie Among'st the Babyes of her eye. There he the beams of those bright Twins, With which all hearts, all eyes he wins, Hath both for Bow and Arrowes found, And nothing now to think begins, Since his own shafts did once rebound, But selfe-love can Almanna wound. The perfect Love. VVhy should I hold my peace &amp; silent be when my life lies on the discovery? Besides I know, infallibly I know That thus a worser fate attends on me Than beasts, for I unto the Altar goe And fall a sacrifice none knowes to who. All other things with time and age receive That full perfection Nature could not give Them at the first, when only wretched I Am the sole prodigy, and downward thrive, Doe grow into my grave, and (tongue-ti'd) die A very'r child than in mine infancy. Before I could have spoken sure I cou'd Have made a shrewd shift to be understood, When now I stand like one with lightning strook, And almost starv'd cannot make signs for food, Only my wants are writ in a sad look, Which for the rich is but too hard a book. At first I could have prattl'd, and have sed What ever my affection dictated; Talk'd a far off of love, and Hymen, prais'd The Marriage, and condemn'd the single Bed: Extol'd that Beauty she her self debas'd, And sworn the new-made Heav'ns not fairer fac'd. How oft I then have took, and gently strain'd A fragrant balm out of her melting hand, And cherish'd it in that strict fellowship VVith mine, her envious Glove could not withstand, But my expiring Soul hung on my lip Would that rich Nectar up in kisses sip! How have I then feasted my greedy eyes VVith the survey of that brave AEdifice; Examin'd the dimensions of my heart To know if it were able to comprise VVhat I beheld; admir'd the state, and art, And lost my self with wonder in each part Then with a blush, or sigh I could have shown How much I wish'd the fabrick were mine own; And she no question understood me too. But now what a strange Lover am I grown, Who can't so much as wish ('tis strang, but true) Her ty'd to one so'unworthy of her view? O Miracle of Love! or let me be A lover of my self as well as she, Or let this bright and immateriall fire Consume this dross, which thus depresses me, And so render me worthy my desire; Or let me quickly in the flame expire. To a Lady working a Bed with Crewell The Murther. Madam, why should you thus mispend an houre? Leave this uncharitable work, Vnder the shaddow of each new-made flower There will a speckled Serpent lurk, Which (though they hurt not you) wil us devour, Alas how many too advent'rous hearts Will perish by their hidden stings? One touch, one look, is worse than forty darts, And far more speedy ruine brings: A curse on them taught Beauty such black Arts. What may we think your serious exercise, If murther be your recreation? Sure on the universe you then devise To bring a totall desolation, And fire the World with your consuming eyes. I say you might more noble pastimes find For to beguile the lazy time; You answer. Thrift on this had set your mind, Iudging such sports indeed a crime; But sure such thrift's to narrow'r Souls confin'd. Ah! cruell Wanton! now your craft I spy, Your riddle now is understood, That you are covetous I'l not deny, But it is covetous of Blood, And you are saving that you may destroy. Now when this guilty peece shall reared be, The Trophey of your Martyr'd Slaves, It shall be stil'd by all that do it see, Since fruitful with so many graves, Not Crewell Bed, but bed of Cruelty. The Revenge. Then let soft slumbers o'r your eyelids creep, When your disquiet fancy spyes Men shipwrack'd in those Seas they Bleed, and Weep; Heares lulabyes compos'd of cryes, And horror rocks your quaking limbs asleep. And sure as death If I be one that fall, (As much I doubt my froward Stars) Let the slain Lovers make me Generall I'l find a means to heal their scarres, And you at last shall bear the smart of all. First such as of your sparkling eyes complain, Vnder their clouds of flesh I'l place To steal those beams wherewith themselves were slain And armed with those glorious rayes, In the next fight they shall kill you again. Then those were hanged in your jacynth hair Shall rob you of a lock or two, Which, heing twisted with a Lovers tear, Shall make a chain to fetter you, Or string the Bow the God of Love doth bear. Next such as perish'd by a frown shall come Arm'd with the hand of time, with which I'l make them plough such furrows in the room May envy to your anger teach; And all your Beauty'st find a grave at home. He that drinks poyson in a kiss, and dyes, I'l knead with your most Virgin breath, Till he to such a noble structure rise (Shake at the curse I now bequeath) Wonder shall close your lips, till death your eyes. And since I am assured that no part Of yours will be assoil'd of Blood, Thaw'd by a scalding sigh I will convert Your frost and snow into a floud, And drown your Beauty with what guards your heart. Then as th' asswaging waters left behind The Earth with slime and rubbish clad, And the surviving Couple did it find But by themselves inhabited, Till pregnant stones renewed lost mankind. So you this inundation overpast, Shall in no part appear the same, But all this world of Beauty be lay'd wast Till pittying Love renew the frame, And you your stony heart behind you cast. But these are weak revenges, fit for those Who could not stand a single charm; Those feeble spirits beaten without blows, And half-consum'd ere I was warm, Yet never look'd beyond your lip or nose. Then what shall I who have survey'd you round? Read over all this Book of Love; Yet still remain'd unconquer'd, till I found How ev'ry line a chain did prove, And ev'ry point thereof had made a wound? Why first I'l kisse you till my wounds be well, And, made of your inverted name, Bind to your bosome such a powerfull spell As while I kisse shall you enflame, Till your unslak'd desire burn hot as Hell. Nor shall your torments vanish when awake, Like to a fearfull dream of fire; No (if I dye) a brave revenge I'l take, And (if I must in flames expire) Will you a terrible example make. Glad Love shall clap his little wings for joy, Fanning therewith the kindled pile, And, that your self may help for to destroy Your self, convert your tears to Oile, And so raise the aspiring flame more high. Then your sick eyes shall languish after all, And at each vary'd object take New fewel, till what now we suns do cal, Turn into blazing Starrs, or make Torches for your own Beauties Funerall. Then your proud heart shall (into tinder burn'd) Take fire with ev'ry falling sparck, While your fair outside Ethiopian turn'd By your own heat, shall in the dark Be even by Whore-masters &amp; Drunkards scorn'd. Thus these gay testimonyes of your Art, Which now so great a triumph have O'r those produc'd by nature, shall convert Their Geniall bed into your grave, And living death, for their dead life impart. Then leave this work of ruine, and employ The hours you dedicate thereto, In saving whom you have condemn'd to dye; To save, more Honour were for you Than to create; much more than to destroy. To a Lady refusing to unvaile. VVhy not unvail? by Heav'n you are Almost as scrupulous as fair, I'l tell you Madam by your leave These niceties do you but deceive, And while from us you would conceal Your Graces, from your self you steal. It is ridiculous to say That publication takes away From Beauty, that's a Species must To others for a Genus trust. For know 'tis generall consent That makes you Women excellent; Nor is't in yours, but in our eyes Your principall perfection lies; And though you bear such monstrous rates, From us you had your estimates. While prostrat at your feet we lye, Our humbled necks mount you so high; Our breath doth lift you up, though grown Out of our reach, to pluck you down. It is Opinion that must tell Nature if she've done ill or well. If Man did never Court her Face Woman would never Court her Glasse; 'Tis we that make you wise or fair, Or good, or whatsoere you are, And when you give your selves to Man 'Tis but his gift giv'n back again. I'l swear but now I look'd on you As I would up to Heaven doe, And valew'd you at such a rate That all Mankind's to poor to pay't, When had you still been clouded thus I should have thought you Leporous. Whoever will a face extoll None ever saw, for Beautyfull, With as much reason might commend The Child unborn for his brave end. But for the eye no Beauty were, No more than Musick but for th'eare. Your gawdy vessels but for man Had empty and unregarded laine, Rotted upon the Dock where they Were built, and never seen the sea; Or Launched forth been made a sport For ev'ry wind, and known no Port: Or, being driv'n to one by chance, (Cheated by your own ignorance,) Where now you richly fraughted come, Return'd laden with ballast home. Let nature rigge you up with all The trim and state a Prodigall And skilfull builder can invent Either for Vse or Ornament; Double and treble Deck you; arm You with the power of your own charms; Hatch you with Beauty, and endow You with that worth may Anchor you; Streamer you with your own bright hayr, That Crown of Comets which you weare, Which like a Glory aptly place Themselves in curls about your face; Of those most lovely eyes of yours Let her create two Cynosures; And more to dazle our weak sence Gild you with beams are shot from thence; With Honour ballast you, and give You that so large prerogative Of a great fortune, yet you stand Windbound, unladen, and unman'd. Our praises are the only gales That have the power to swell your sailes: We are your Merchants, and you are From us to have your bill of fare; We are your Pilots, who should sit At th'Helm, though by you thrust from it; We (Madam) are your Iudges too, (Though too oft sentenced by you) And gen'rally beleeve that she, (Chuse how Miraculous it be) That any waies declines so just A triall, doth her self mistrust. Then draw this Cypresse cloud which doth Thus both to Beauty wrong, and truth; And since there is no cause for this, Let not the world believe there is. On a lame and scolding Negro Hold me the light a little, what is this, Which both the substance &amp; the shadow is? What work of darkness is't that talks thus loud, Like Thunder, speaking from behind a cloud? Whose face looks like Nights mantle, and the Sun Withdraws himself, if by her look'd upon? Now I conjure thee by Belzebub tel Me what thou art, be thou a Fiend of Hell, Or else some Christian soul, which, thus with smoke And fire all black'd, hath Purgatory broke; Or be thou indeed Mortall, flesh and blood Like us, felt, (heard I'm sure) and understood. If so, why dost thou wear this veyl? from whence Proceeds in Creatures such a difference? Sure Nature, griev'd for some great loss, to shew Her sorrow, cloth'd thee in a mourning hue, And made thee lame, that it might not lye hid How little care she took of what she did: Or else in thee she bountifully show'd Where she her richest treasures had bestow'd; Thy body all compact of golden Ore Taught us where thou wert found to look for more; And by that means thou wert at once a Scorn To us, and Traytor to thy Countrey born. An Epithalamivm Invocation of Hymen, Come Hymen, come, 'tis thou alone Can'st satisfie this longing payr; 'Tis thou must justifie them one, As they in heart already are. Come then and joyn their willing hands, That as their souls long since did kiss, Their bodies may no longer stand Exempted from so great a bliss. Fly, fly, thou snail-pac'd God to Church, And hasten the solemnities: Ne'r trifle time to light thy torch, But rather doe it at her eyes. Thou would'st not use this needless stay, Wert thou but warm'd with half their fire; Then how should Mortals brook delay When they be winged with desire? Come Hymen, come, thou art too slow; Th' impatient Groom is in a rage, He tels the Moments as they goe, And thinks each minute is an Age. The bashfull Bride hangs down her head, And silently she curses thee. Her Cheeks are double-dy'd in red, With Anger and with Modesty. The Turtles on the Altars mourn To see their deaths deferr'd so long, And Cupid in a rage hath sworn Thou dearly shalt repent the wrong. Venus knits her offended brow, And with her angry Son accords No Rites hereafter to allow, But taking one anothers words. Thus, thus will thy cold Altars fall, Thus will thy Temples be defac'd, And thou abandoned of all Wilt be Vndeify'd at last. Then, while some reverence thy name, While thou art yet esteem'd divine, Throw not the remnant of thy Fame Away, but these two Lovers joyn. To a Gentlewoman that sued to her Servant, whom she had formerly forsaken. Thou may'st as well leave off; thy tears, or smiles, I count no better than a Crocadiles, And all thy protestations are but wiles. Thou may'st as easily out-noise the Wind, Deaf the rude Sea, make Love no longer blind, As change the tenor of a setled mind. I'd Lov'd too long should I not know at last How quickly all thy vowes were overpast, And thy old servant by a new displac'd. And should I know all this, and not take heed, 'Twere pity then but I afresh should bleed, And you might begge me for a fool indeed. False Woman no, thy unsuspected fall Hath quench'd those flames, and left, of that great All, Nought but the ashes of Loves funerall. And can'st thou hope to kindle a new fire Where there be left no sparks of old desire, And a Love-broken heart is made intire? Why then I'l yeeld; but, since I cannot be Thy Love, such Miracles shal make of thee A God, and I'l adore thy deity. But thou art far from that, as Heavens from cares, So farre thou can'st not hope for't in thy Prayr's, Nor purchase with thy penitential tears. For my young hate of thee is so improv'd, As I to hate my self am almost mov'd When I but think that I a woman lov'd. Yet I'l not say all Women are untrue, Nor but the bad may mend, but never you, However I wil ne'r beleeve you doe. But if, as thou hast prodigally swore, Thou lov'st me better now than e'r before: Shew it me then and trouble me no more. How to chuse a Mistres. First I would have a face exactly fair; Not long, nor yet precisely circular. A smooth high brow, where neither Age, nor yet A froward peevishness hath wrinckles set, And under that a pair of clear black eyes To be the windows of the Ædifice; Not sunck into her head, nor starting out; Not fix'd, nor rolling wantonly about; But gently moving, as to whet the sight By some fresh object, not the appetite: Their Orbs both equal, and divided by A wel-proportion'd noses Ivory. The nostrils open, fit to try what air Would best preserve the Mansion, what impair. The colour in her cheek so mixt, the eye Cannot distinguish where the red doth lye, Or white; but ev'ry part thereof, as loth To yeeld in either, equally hath both: The mouth but little, whence proceeds a breath, Which might revive one in the gates of death, And envy strike in the Panchayan groves, When their spic'd tops a gentle East-wind moves. The lips ruddy, as blushing to be known Kissing each other, by the Lookers on; And these not to perpetual talk dispos'd, Nor alwayes in a lumpish silence clos'd; But e'vry word her innocence brings forth Sweetned by a discreet and harmles mirth. The teeth even, and white; a dimpled chin; And al these clothed with the purest skin. Then, as good painters ever use to place The darker shadow to the fairer face, A sad brown hair, whose am'rous curles may tye The Pris'ners fast, ta'ne captive by her eye. Thus would I haue her face; and for her mind I'd have it cloth'd in Vertue, not behind The other's Beauty, for a house thus drest Should be provided of a noble guest. Then would I have a body so refin'd, Fit to support this face, enclose this mind. When all these Graces I in one doe prove, Then may Death blind me if I do not love. Yet there is one thing more must needs concur; She must love me as well as I love her. Love without Hope. Hopeless (ah me) I love, nor can I tel Whether my Love, or my Despair, Deserve to be esteem'd the greater Hel, For both alike do breed my care; Despaires cold frost cooleth not hot desire, Nor yet is warmed at the Neighb'ring fire The faculties of my distemper'd mind, Anothers servants are becom, And my corrupted reason hath resign'd To his old enemy his room; There the Vsurper now the tyrant playes. Ill must that kingdom thrive where Faction sways. Too greedily I gaz'd, and through mine eyes My heart did fly unto her brest. She, with her own contented, straight denyes To entertain so poor a guest. With tears it begg'd, that since it had bestow'd It self on her, it might not lye abroad. But, she by this confirmed in her scorn, No tears, no prayers were prevalent; Coldly she did advise it to return, And, proud she'd counsail it, it went. But (ah) in vain; struck blind with too much light, The way was stopt th'rough wch it took its flight. Naked and wounded it lay helpless there, Till, I who once had owned it, Was for the Run'way a Petitioner, I onely begg'd she would permit The wretch a habitation there to have, Though used in the Nature of a slave. Indeed I hoped better, for could I Imagine she would ever brand Her name with breach of Hospitality, Whose credit did so candid stand, As all that knew her thought they might deter Vice from their Childten, if nam'd after her? But what's more free than guift? this empty seat Doth feel the absent Captives pain, And now too late I do her heart intreat Far Hostage, or mine own again. Thus by my folly am I overthrown; Constrain'd to beg for what was once mine own. My heart a Slave; Reason of rule bereft; My Will, and Vnderstanding wait On hers, and unto me is only left Th' sad Memory of a better State. What can I hope for then, who am so poor? Besides my sorrows I can give no more. The dumb Lover Fair Almanna, cruell Maid, Many Shepherds had enflamed, Whose complaints her sport she made, Frowning still when Love was named, Yet those frowns did Love perswade. 'Mong the rest (ah hapless Youth) Annaphil did wish to have her, Though scant of wealth, yet in sooth Passing all that sought her favour, For his passing, passing truth. This poor Wretch sought to suppress With his tears the rising fire, But those tears prov'd witnesses To the World of his desire, And his paines were ne'r the less. Speak he durst not, for he fear'd No death worse than a denyall; Yet in his eyes, still betear'd, A too miserable tryall Of what Love can doe, appear'd. Armes across, unsteady pace, Eyes cast down as in subjection, Broken words, and changed face, A most desperate affection In the wofull youth betrayes. Coward Love, oft would he say, Who thy shafts on slaves bestowest; Wounding such as doe obey, But with Rebels meeting, throwest Down thine arms, and runn'st away: Was it not enough that I Willingly thy yoke took on me? But I must that service buy, Which (I fear) hath quite undon me With fresh cares, fresh misery? Was it not enough that thou With thy proper force refused To succour me, but that now My tongue (th'rough thee speech-disused) Cannot mine own thoughts avow? Art thou a God, who I see Thus thy humblest Vassals wrongest? No, thy weaker Deity Either yields unto her strongest, Or thy sting is lost in me. Then his hearty sighs would show What his tongue had left unspoken, And he beat his brest to know If his heart, already broken, Now were quite consum'd or no. And, as if those windy sighs, Had in him a tempest raised, Flouds would seem to drown his eyes, Because they too much had gazed For unsafe discoveries. Once he in this wofull Plight Had his lovely Saint espyed; But at that unlook'd for sight The storm was lay'd, the flouds dryed, And his eyes beheld the light. How he then amazed stood! With what more than glutton-greediness He devour'd that precious food! Health could not diswade his neediness From what his sence found so good. His eyes left Physicians rules; Measure in such feasts observed Is a lesson fit for fools: They from such nice precepts swerved Traind in Love and Beautyes Schools. Yet his tongue would fain have gat So much leisure from their wonder, As might serve for to relate What a burthen he lay under; But to speak it knew not what. And when he her heart to bow Had fram'd a speech full of passions, Mingling many a faithfull vow With more humble supplications, Then (alas) it knew not how. Yet his other parts did prove Friends to its determination; All his gestures spoke of Love, All did seem to begge compassion; Even his silent lips did move. And in words, which never are Heard but by the understanding, Whisper'd forth, O heav'enly Faire, O Godess all, al commanding, Deign to hear a Caitiff's prayer. Long have I lov'd, loved well, Faithfull Love not hate deserveth. What salvage mind is so fell, As his loving flock he sterveth, If not sav'd by Miracle? Long have I serv'd, service true Requires wages for paines-taking; And, though stipends were not due, What Miser's so given to raking As he would no favour shew? Long have I in fetters lay'n; Misery compassion breedeth; And, though Pity quite were slain, The bloody'st mind never feedeth On such as count death a gain. See but how the Sun displayes His beams on the meanest Creatures; And will you withdraw your rayes From one who admires your features, And knows no light but your face? See our fruitfull Mother earth, How she in her Womb doth cherish The Seed, till a happy birth Makes the Lab'rors fields to flourish; And will you bring forth a dearth? Mark how ev'ry grateful tree Yeelds the Swain a yearly blessing, And will you undressed be Ere you'l either pay for dressing, Or accept the Courtesie? When a fruitfull showr of rain From a melting cloud distilleth, The earth drinks it up again, And it the earths wrinckles filleth; Shall my tears then fall in vain? Breath you forth a fervent Pray'r, Heav'n therewith is straight acquainted, And you hope will ease your care; Should not then my sute be granted, Since you so like to Heav'n are? Love the neighb'ring Elm and Vine In such strict embraces tyeth: Love doth make the Turtle pine When his loving marrow dyeth; And have you no sense of mine? Love his power doth each where prove, Ev'ry thing hath Love about it, Trees, Beasts, Birds, and Gods above, And are you alone without it? The most lovely void of Love? Change, O change this hum'rous mind; Never by a name be fooled, Greater glory will you find, Be by Flesh and Bloud but ruled, If you leave a Babe behind. Were you now laid in your grave, And this beauteous out-side rotten, No monuments your fame could save, Vertue quickly is forgotten, If the world no Pictures have. Then, if Marriage be the best, The best Lover should be chosen. Will you warm a Niggards brest, Whose desire with care is frozen, And his Mistress in his chest? Or shall any sensuall slave Glory in so rich a Treasure; One who covets but to have You to satisfie his pleasure, Which his lust, not Love doth crave? Rather take a man would dye, One who goods and life despiseth, Might he pleasure you thereby; (This from perfect Love ariseth) Such an one (though poor) am I. Thus within himself he pray'd, But receiv'd small satisfaction, For she heard not what be said, And she would not read his action. So the Wretch is quite dismay'd. A Remedy against Love. If thou like her slowing tresses, Which the unshorn Phœbus stain, Think what grief thy heart oppresses, And how ev'ry curls a chain Onely made to keep thee fast, Till thy sentence be o'rpast. If thou'rt wounded by her eyes Where thou thinkest Cupids lie, Think thy self the Sacrifice, Those the Priests that make thee die: If her forehead beauteous show, Think her forehead Cupid's bow. If the Roses thou hast seen In her cheek still flourishing Argue that there dwels within A calme, and perpetuall Spring, Though she never us'd deceit, Believe all is counterfeit. If her tempting voice have power To amaze and ravish thee, Sirens sung but to devour, Yet they sung as well as shee. O beware those poyson'd tongues That carry death in their songs. If the best perfumes seem vile To her odorif'rous breath, And the Phœnix fun'rall pile When she propagates in death, Then remember how that she Lives by that doth poyson thee. If her comly hody ha's Fairest in thine eye appear'd, Think how that a Trophey was Only for thy ruine rear'd. Women oft their beauties praise On their Lovers ruines raise. And if she have ev'ry part May a Woman perfect make, And, without the help of Art, Firmest resolutions shake, Know Pandora had so too, Who was made but to undoe. But if vertue please thee most, And thou like her Beautious mind, Then I give thee o'r for lost; There no remedy I find; Yet if she be vertuous then Sure she will not murther men. Answer to the former. Oh Vain lip-wisdom, that dost make me school Another in those things I cannot learn My self! only this diff'rence I discern To be 'twixt thee and a professed fool; He wears his cognisance, but thou hast hit Asse-like upon the Lyon skin of Wit. Fool that I was! what if those curles be chains, What if her eyes do murther my content, What if her brow be to my ruine bent; Are fear of death, hate of a prisoners pains, Of power to set the wretched captive free, And not (rather) augment his misery? How id'ly have I talk'd! if I could rack My faith till I believed she did paint, Would not the wrong don such a faultless Saint Be a fresh torment to my soul, and make Me hate my self who did so basely err, Rather than have a misconceit of her? Sure too much wit hath made me mad. I said The Sirens only sung to work our harm; But who at any time avoids the charm? Vlisses did. Vlisses was afraid And since he scap'd) may thank his timely fears That taught him (e're he heard them) t'stop his ears. But here's a potent argument indeed, There is (forsoth) such an antipathy Betwixt us two, her breath doth poyson me! I would I might upon such poyson feed; But were it so; have I nor finely brought An Antidote when 't hath already wrought? Here comes more stuff of the stamp; that brave Store-house of Noble worth, Vertues best seat, Where first (like Sisters) she and Beauty met, Made but a Trophey for a Conquer'd slave. And what inferrs all this, but that I am Hers (by the Rule of War) who overcame? Into what errors do poor Lovers slip! But now, I did affirm Pandora made So fayr, that man might better be betray'd. Were the Gods cheated in their workmanship? But that they knew Mans frailty had they sent Her, thus adorned, for a punishment? Here have I mixed truths with falshoods; right Indeed it is that in a vertuous Love The Soul is fix'd, and findeth no remove; But 'twere as base and false for to endite A vertuous Woman for destroy'ng Mankind, As th' Sun when the rash gazer is Struck blind. I Love (alas) I Love, nor all the skill Of my subjected reason can resist His power who Tyrannises as he list; Acknowledging no Law besides his will: And I by striving doe but make my sore Fester, my bondage harder than before. To Almanna, Why She should Marry Me. How comes this suddain change, my Dear? I will be sworn, not full two dayes agoe Thou wert most excellently fayr, But now, I grieve to say't, thou'rt nothing so. No sicknes could disfigure you, Nor sorrow plough such wrinckles in your face, Your happy bosome never knew That sawdy thought, which durst disturb your peace. But yet if grief or sicknes should Have the good Fortune to approach so nigh, Sicknes it self recover would, And sorrow be converted into joy. Nor can I yet believe you owe Ought unto Art for the last face you wore, A Borrow'd Beauty you I know Despise, and would have none at all before. Chuse how it be, methinks that face Appears to me now no such Miracle; Yet still it is the same it was, Only it doth not please me half so well. Then you will say tis evident The change is in my judgment and not you: It is so, but then you must grant 'Tis, 'cause I know more now than then I knew. Sweet! I will tell thee; heretofore I never pierced further than thy Skin; Reading thy body o'r and o'r; Without examining what was within. And then indeed I did esteem Thy matchless Beauty at so high a rate, That ev'ry object else did seem A mere deformity compar'd to that. But now this happy day, I have Discovered a new and richer mine, I all my admiration gave To that most admirable soul of thine, Which so dims all exterior form That now thy Body worthless did appear, And sure had faln beneath my scorn, But that I see thy soul is lodged there. Now, if thy Body in revenge Shall yeeld it self to base desires, thoul't see Another, but a far worse change; Thy Body fair, thy Soul deform'd will be. But if thou wilt give me a right To call them both mine own, thou so shalt make Them both seem precious in thy sight, Yet neither from the others lustre take. For while my soul is thus alone The Iudge both of thy soul and body made, It partially inclines to one And no regard is to the other had. But if my body once were join'd In the Commission with it, then would thine A farre more equall sentence find Being supported by the Love of mine. Like is best judge of like we say, And sure in shape I wondrous like thee am, Since thus by the whole world we may So easily be taken for the same: Then plight me but thy troth, and thou, Both in thy Mortall, and Immortall part, Shalt seem more fair than thou seem'st now; Nay, were it possible, more fair than th' art. Then I all day will gaze on thee, And feast at night on what I then did view, And thou (my Dear) shalt so both be My study and my recreation too. Nor shalt thou yet, though made one flesh With me, lose any thing at all thereby; But grow to more by being less, And even by contraction multiply. Our very souls shall twine and be So close in mutuall embraces knit, They shall grow Parents too, and we New vertues will as well as Children get. Still'd th'rough th' alimbeck of desire Our bodies by degrees shall melt away, And purg'd by a still equall fire From all their dross, grow souls as well as they. But if thou trust to others eyes, And shalt reject so generous a flame, Beleeve it others shal thee prize, Not as the wonder of thy sex but shame. The brighter that the Angels were Before they from their first Creation fel, Each one did afterwards appear By so much the more dark, and terrible. And if thou look but back thoul't find Pride, and Rebellion causes of their fall; Sinnes, to which Murther will be joyn'd In thee, and make thee the great'st Dev'l of all. For know this heart of mine was given Long since up to the power of Love; but he God-like, did still keep state in Heaven, And only ruled there by Deputy. And since he had the faith suspected Or skill, of any one particular, He unadvisedly erected An Aristocracy of ev'ry fair. But thence such evils did ensue, And my poor heart was so in pieces rent, That he at length did fix on you, And made it a Monarchick Government. Then now thou'st All that All they had, Should'st thou turn Tyrant, &amp; with fire &amp; sword Thine own Dominions invade, Would'st thou not be by the whole world abhorr'd? The Angels thinking to depose The Deity, were into Devils turn'd: And fear'st not thou the fate of those, (Whose sin thou imitat'st,) if I be scorn'd? For though thou covet not the Throne, Yet thou dethronest Loves great Deity; And though thou make them not thine own, The Subject kill'st, and kingdom dost destroy. The Meteor. Did you behold that glorious Star, (my Dear) (W?? shin'd but now, me thought, as bright As any other childe of light, And seem'd to have as good an interest there) How suddenly it fell, our Eyes Pursuing it through all the spacious Skies, Through which the now extended Flame Had chalk'd the way to Earth from whence it came? And were you not with wonder struck to see Those Forms, which the Creation had At first in number perfect made, Thus sometimes more, and sometimes lesse to be? Or rather in this second Birth, To see Heav'n copy'd out so near by Earth, As were it not for their own fall, We should not know which were the Original? Fair one, these diff'rent Lights do represent Such as pretend unto the Love Of you, off which some Meteors prove, Some Stars; some high fix'd in Loves Firmament, And some (that seem as bright and fair) More basely humble hover in the Air Of words, and with fine dextrous art, Do act a Passion never touch'd their heart, Yet these false Glow-worm fires a while do shine Equal to the most Heav'n-born flame, And so well counterfeit the same, That they, though almost beastly, seem divine; But should some blinde unlucky chance Deform you any ways, or make your wants Vie Greatnesse with your Beauty, then, They drop to their own Element agen. That Witch self-love is the sole Guide to these, And sets such Charms upon their Bloud, That 'tis with it or Ebb or Floud, According to their own Conveniencies; And now those seem thus clear and high, They also mount and shine, but by and by Not able to maintain that height, Fall over-charg'd with their own sordid weight. That seeming Star which shot but now was made Of Vapors by the Sun exhal'd, When our Meridian he scal'd, And still had stayed there, had he still stay'd; But now its proper Centre is Thus interposed betwixt him and this, In that forc'd height it will remain No longer, but inclines to Earth again. So while your Beauty its bright Rayes projects Vpon these grov'ling sons of Earth, It giveth new affections Birth, And to a nobler height their souls erects; So winging their new-born desire, Their towring thoughts dare at your self aspire, And gotten the half way, do there Hover a while 'twixt yours and their own Sphere. But when the night of Absence doth divide You from their view, and their first base Desires possesse the middle space, And court them back again, their thoughts abide No longer in suspense, nor stay So much as the decision of the Day, But ere that can, with you, return, They all unite themselves to the first-born. Now such as love like me are truly Stars, And even then do shine most bright When most you do absent your light: Let Chance, let Nature place the strongest bars Of wealthy Earth 'twixt you and me, Or masque you with a Cloud of Leprosie, Yet still my Love should be the same, And at some part of your great soul still light its flame. An Epithalamivm Upon T.P. and M.H. Insulting Night proud in her lengthned sway. Hail glorious Maid, whose brighter beams display, And with fresh lustre wing the tardy Day. Phoebus, who worn with Age, now bed-rid lies, Looks out to see what God his room supplies, And takes new vigor from your sparkling eyes. Some, who your morning Blushes saw, did swear The Sun look'd red, and a foul day was near; But all the showre will be a maiden tear. Fair Virgin blush not, (though a Bride) to none Are you beholding for the Light which shone; Guided unto the Temple by your own. No intermedling God can claim a share In this Conjunction; you your selves did pair; They not Assistants but Spectators were. Cupid his Quiver empty'd had in vain; Your Husband did retort his shafts again; But with one glance shot from your eye was slain. The pitying Epidaurian straight was mov'd, But all his Balsams ineffectual prov'd: 'Tis known he dies you wound, if not belov'd. Glad Love with his recovered shafts perswades Himself he easily can conquer Maids, And with his dull Artillery you invades: But his ill-headed Darts did all rebound; Onely soft pity there an entrance found: So Buff daunts Swords, which a weak straw will wound. The blow was double, you your self did grone, When you beheld what you your self had done, And surely lov'd his wound because your own. Hymen the Priest of Heav'n then left the Skies To wait on you in these Solemnities, But had his Torch extinguish'd by your eyes. The busie God, that he might something do Studied a Benediction then; but you Prov'd both the Blessing and the Donor too. Ioves Herald, warned by the Trump of Fame, His Hat and Feet new-winged hither came, To blesse you in his absent Fathers name. Who would have come himself, but that afraid The Gyants of this Age should Heav'n invade, Were they not by his awfull Thunder staid. Thus should the God have spoke; but he doth stand With wonder dumb, &amp; from his trembling hand, The Charmer charm'd, lets fall his snaky wand. Bacchus beheld, who all amazed cry'd, Had Semel' had these Rayes she had not dy'd; But Iove himself (though arm'd with lightning) fry'd. Straight he his wine-press leaves, &amp; bringeth down For you his Ariadnes starry Crown; But findes you wear a richer of your own. The God of War doth from the Battail flie; Hangs up his uselesse Sword and layeth by All other tokens of Hostility. His crimson'd hand from bloud; his brow from sweat, And dust now cleans'd, he humbly doth intreat He may on you to Concora's Temple wait. But while he covets peace, the God doth wage A War within himself, whose potent rage Doth in the Conflict all his Pow'rs engage. The twice repulsed Cupid, who his sight For this days triumph begd, doth curse the light; Before but hood-winckt; now he's blinded quite. Vulcan his Forge in Sicily neglects, And hither his lame steps in haste directs, Heav'ns peril, nor Ioves anger he respects. A thousand Hammers in his brain do beat, And all his study is how he may get You fetter'd in his Artificial Net. But the deceived God while that he plac'd And in conceit already you embrac'd, Was by a look of yours himself chain'd fast. His Wife at once blush'd, wept, and sigh'd, and frown'd, And cri'd, Now is my Paphos unrenown'd, And all her Glory in this Muert-lake drown'd. My Mars hath left me, would she would allow Me but my long despised Husband now; But he is Pris'ner too, I know not how. This said, she yokes her Doves, resolv'd to see If by her Beauty she again might free Whom yours had brought into Captivity. Vain was her Enterprize, she soon confest, The Magick of her Face could not contest With yours, and so stood gazing with the rest. The warlike Pallas knits her martial brows, And as she shakes her trembling spear, she vows Revenge, then her unveiled Gorgon shows: But strait she found her Error, You alone Did more than she determin'd to have done, Medusa's Head and She both turn'd to stone. The bashfull Phoebe with a down-cast look To beg your kinde Reflexion hither took A journey, and her dark'ned Orb forsook: But ready now to utter her Desire, The light was such she durst approach no nigher, Nor yet in that amazement could retire. Great Iuno backs a Cloud, and as she sails Thorow the Air, her blushing Face she vails (Now vanquish'd twice) with her stript Peacocks tails. Her Argos hundred Eyes she hates, and pin'd With Envie wishes that she had been blinde Her self, when first she did your Beauty finde. The Goddess stoops to Earth, &amp; thinks to shrowd You from Ioves view in a condensed Cloud; But you disperst it, and more glorious shew'd. Thus all the Gods this morning suffer'd shame By you alone, and stood as in a Dream, Till you once joyn'd, unto themselves they came. And now Bacchus and Ceres strive who best Shall please your company; for you they ghest Would most on one anothers Faces feast. The others (daring not appear) have sent, By me their Proxy this short complement, Which once delivered away they went. Bright Virgin, though your blooming youth abound With all those Virtues which the Earth adorn; Though ev'ry part be with that Beauty crown'd, May make it noon ere it be fully morn. Though bounteous Heav'n no blessings hath in store Which you deserve not richly to enjoy; Whatever Phoebus doth behold, and more, Even to twist the thread of Destiny. Though you deserve the Seas discovered womb Should unto you her hidden Treasures give, Which when you die should serve to build your Tomb; But all the Gods attend you whilest you live. Though we confesse all this to be your due, Yet do not boast that it is yours alone; Your Husband meriteth both this, and you; What then deserve you now conjoyn'd in one? May you live long and happy, all your dayes Crown'd with a lasting plenty and content; May no disturbance ever cloud the Face; But what one doth, let be by either meant. A fruitfull, and a toward Linage blesse Your youth; the subject to support your age; And when Death summons you, in happinesse May they succeed as well as Heritage. And (if more may be said) may you two have Blessings above your hopes, above your wishes; And when age fits your bodies for the Grave, May then your spirits meet breath'd out in Kisses. Thus the uncaptiv'd Gods do joyntly pray, Yet Iuno vows a chast revenge withall, Swearing (fair Bride) that you a while shall stay, Before you do upon Lucina call. On a Necklace of small Pomander, given him by a Lady. And art thou mine at length? com'st thou to deck My worthlesse Wrist thus persum'd by her neck? Canst thou so freely to my use dispense That precious Odor thou receivedst thence? Couldst thou (alas) such real joys forsake For this sad cause to justifie thy black? Me thought thou wert, while thou didst that invest, The cinders of the Phœnix spiced Nest, Out of whch rose her admirable Face, As the sole species of that Virgin Race. There hadst thou grown immortal; while worn there No day but added to thy Life a Year: But now thou dost with me in Exile live, Each day doth take, what there each day did give. Alas poor Fool! Man might have taught thee this, Death waits on those are banish'd Paradize. Couldst thou have still continu'd there, thou'dst Long-liv'd as he, had he not found out sin. No Fate had cut thy thread, nor chance unstrung bin Thy Beads, till the Worlds Passing-Bell had rung. Pearls had look'd pale with Envy, Diamonds mourn'd, And sparkling forth their prouder anger burn'd, While every grain of thee had grown a Gem Of greater price than the whole Race of them. The wary Prophets mercenary Wife, Who for a Bracelet sold her Husband's life, And thought her Crime excus'd, the flame-fac'd Being such prevalent Temptations, All her so dear-bought Iewels would have thrown stones Down at her feet for the exchange of one Thou'dst grown a Rosary for Angels there, Thy glorious Beads dropt in eternal Prayer. Offer'd in smoke thou mightst have bought the Gods Out of their Heaven to have chang'd Abodes With thee; we should have seen the deathlesse Train About her neck link'd in an endlesse Chain: The emulous Powers contending who should rest On the Swan-downy Pillows of her brest, Where by a more especial favor thrown, They had that Heav'n preferred to their own. And canst thou quit so coveted a place To feel such a sick Pulses frantick pace? To circle this poor arm which still must mourn Because it must not be where thou wert worn? Indeed 'tis true my small Physician, she Taught thee thy skill, but 'tis best shew'd on me. Thanks charitable Friend. For this will I Study a reward great as thy courtesie. No Relique shall be kept more safe, nor be In greater Adoration had than thee: Each morning will I with a trembling kisse Offer my burning Lips in Sacrifice: All day look on thee with that greedy view, As if I meant to string mine Eyes there too: At night my never slumbring thoughts shall keep The Watch, while thou dost in my bosome sleep; And lest my panting Heart alarm thee there, Ile turn it out for to be lodg'd elsewhere: I would not with a minutes absence buy The World, though Heav'n were the Security. I'l tell thy numerous seeds, and know the same Not onely by their number, but by name; Then set a higher price on ev'ry Bead, Than I would ransom upon a Monarchs head; No wealth should fetch thee from me, unlesse she Would be the price her self, who owned thee. When scorch'd by some proud Beauty, I for shade Will flie to the small knots of thy dark brade: And when I'm ready with despair to freez, I will inflame my self by kissing these; Driv'n to Extremity I scarce would stoop To take the Chymists greatest secret up; For with a touch of thee my fancy would Be sure to turn all Metalls into Gold. Thou art my All on Earth, and he that robs Me but of one of these thy little Globes, I in Heav'ns juster Chancery will lay To's charge the stealing the whole World away; But which (when Fate protract) thy time is come, (Hastned with grief to be so long from home) Thou shalt from me again to her depart; For on the flaming Altar of my Heart I'll all the filth thou here contracted'st take Away, and so in Incense pay thee back. Thus Ile requite thy kindnesse; but be sure, Thou dost not wound, where thou pretend'st to cure; 'Twould be a treach'rous and unworthy Art, Thus ty'd about mine arm, to give my Heart. On Himself being Lame. I Prithee tell not me of Pox or Gout; It is my Fancie's fall'n into my Foot. I know her haughty stomack did disdain To lie a soaking in a small-Beer brain; This Salamander doth in flames still dwell, And in a cooling Iulip findes a Hell. Give her a Bowl of Spanish, which might breath A Feaver into the cold Limbs of Death; Might make the Brethrens Marble rise, &amp; dance, Till it had wak'd the drowsie Puritans, And raised their new-molded dust to sing Zealous Encomiums of the Cath'lique King: Then she will knock at Heav'n: this Tavern flie, When throughly drench'd in Sack doth soar most high, And (like the South-winde) from her dropping wings, Shakes the bright showre, which up in numbers springs; Numbers might pose Arithmetick, and teach Dull man what feet will up to Heaven reach; Numbers, which without sweating are distill'd, And writ when you'd believe the Inck was spill'd, And that in so harmonious a strain You'd finde a Musick in the pretious rain. Then might you see her Wine-wet cheeks outshine The Muses washing in their Hippocrene: She were a Wife for Bacchus then but that He must not marry what himself begat. Then she'd out-noise Ioves thunder, that which rent The Womb of Semele for the Firmament: Swear that with Genial Nectar he was warm'd, When's fertile brain brought forth Minerva arm'd, And tell me if I'd heat it well with Wine His should not be more pregnant than should mine; She would be my Minerva, nor afraid To challenge at both Weapons the great Maid; And she would still have swagger'd there no doubt, If I would still have turn'd my Reason out; But when she found her selfe was over-aw'd By that, the ranting Girl her self out-law'd; Then to spite me, she sick (forsooth) doth grow, And onely because I would not be so: Drooping she down into my Anckle fell Angry that I at Night should stand so well, And as she sunk she whisper'd in mine Ear, 'Twas Iustice to lame me who lamed her. Since thou (saith she) wilt needs grow wise, and staid, I'l stay thee within doors till thou grow mad; When businesse shall invite thee forth, or Friends, Thou shalt not stir, not though thy Mistris sends. Keep thy head sober, and mark if thou don't, Ere I have done, wish thou could'st go upon't; There let thy precious Reason rule, while I, To spite her, raise thy humble foot as high. There I, like Bacchus in Iove's Calf, will keep Such Revels, as shall rob thine Eyes of sleep; Run raging up and down, as if I were Turn'd Froe, and kept his frantick Orgies there; There will I quaff cold humors stead of Sack, And dance on th' Ropes till thy tough Sinews crack. Then shalt thou call for Wine, fill, fill again, And not for pleasure drink, but ev'n for pain, Till thou hast been at a more vast expence To drive, than might before have kept me thence. Yet I'l not cripple thee of both, still use One Leg, and stand on't like a studying Goose; Make lamentable Verses, tun'd with Oh, And comma'd with Alas, which could they go But smoothly on a Ballad-singers tongue, Vnto Holla my Fancy, might be sung: But whatsoere thou henceforth writest shall Serve for waste Paper to the Hospitall; Nor shalt thou there finde any parcell man So lame, as he thy halting Rithmes can skan. This is the truth, then never wonder why A harsh low Fancy writes nor smooth, nor high. What do her Numbers then in print, you'll say? Why, Faith, if they be good, I hope they may; If not, she is a Witch, and you'll confesse, The Law condemneth Witches to the Presse. The broken Heart God doth require a broken Heart; 'tis true; But he would have it whole, and broken too: Broken when it on it's own sins reflects; Intire when Him it's Object it respects. Woman will have the same; her Lover's Soul Must also both divided be and whole; Whole in regard none else doth in it share, But yet divided betwixt Hope and Fear. Heav'n and Imperious Woman both lay claim Vnto my Heart, and both will have the same Vnrivall'd, yet the easi'r to decide The bus'nesse I presumed to divide Betwixt them what they sought, &amp; so being loth To displease either, have displeas'd them both. What should I do? I knew I should prefer My God, and therefore could not give it her: And when I would have given him all his due, Me thought in her I saw a Deity too. O Fool! thousands may claim thy Heart, but none Can have a Right unto his Claim but One. And can'st thou not distinguish Titles? He Doth Mercy exercise; she Tyranny. A Love-bred Confidence is the best signe Of a just Monarchy; a Right Divine. And Cruelty grounded upon distrust Is full as sure a note of an unjust. Give God thy broken heart, he whole will make it; Give Woman thy whole heart, and she will break it. To Phoebvs, Seeing a Lady before Sun-rise. Phœbus lye still, and take thy rest Securely on thy Tethy's brest; Thou need'st not rise to guild the East: For she is up whose wakings may Give birth and measure to the day, Although thou hide thy self away. Phœbus lye still, and keep the side Warm of thy chast and watry Bride, Thy useless Glory laid aside: For she is up whose beautie's might Can change ev'n Darkness into Light, When thou can'st but succeed the Night. Phœbus lye still, and shroud thy head Within the covert of thy Bed, Or counterfeit that thou art dead: For she is up, and I do find Gazing on thee doth onely blind The outward eyes, but her the Mind. Yet Phœbus rise, and take thy Chair Once more, shaking dull vapors from thy hair But wink, and look not on my fair: For if thou once her Beauty view, Ere night thou wilt thy self undo, Nor have a home to go unto. And were thy Chariot empty, she But too unfit a guide would be, Having already scorched me: For I'm afraid lest with desire She once more set the World on fire, Making all others Æthiops by her.
