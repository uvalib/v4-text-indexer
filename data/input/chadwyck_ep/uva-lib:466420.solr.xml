PATRICK'S FEAST [A POWER OF SOUND] Then they all got blind drunk, which completed their bliss: And we keep up the custom from that day to this. Lover's History of Ireland. 'Twas at the yearly Feast for Oireland won By Oireland's Sainted Son: The Feast we keep in state, (May be kept up too late), And meet, nor mate alone, But whiskey-fixins, I'll be bound,— Lashins o' that unstinted going round, So should His mimory be crown'd, Wid juicy lemons, sugar lumps beside, An some hot wather too supplied, But more of the potheen our pride. Happy, happy thim who share! Come o'er the wave! Come o'er the wave! Come o'er the wave and we'll drink fair!Chorus — The whiskey wave, and we'll drink fair. Tim O' Thews, placed on high, Amid the tuneful quire, Wid flying fingers touch'd his lyre (It was a bagpipes, by the bye,— The more 'tis to admire). His song began from when The ugly varmint made their den (A power of varmint among men) In Oireland. Dragons there abode And many a sarpient, many a toad, Till Patrick to the work address'd His saintly soul. He smote his breast, And swore the Oirish waists, where curl'd The sarpients, should be sarpient-free, the first floor of the world. The listening crowd admire the lofty swear: St. Pathrick to the fore! they see him there; St. Pathrick! shure he 's here, so all outside declare. Wid ravish'd ears Each Paddy hears, Flings off his hod, And, wid a nod, Repates the moighty shout that seems to shake the spheres.Chorus — Repate, and shake the spheres! The praise of Pathrick then the swate musician sang, Of Pathrick wid the oily wily tongue: The jolly Saint in triumph comes: Blow the trumpets! thump the drums! Flush'd, and wid a purple grace, He shows his honest face: Now give the pipes your wind! he comes! he comes! Pathrick, first of saints among, Whiskey-drinkin did invint: Pathrick's lavings are a treasure, Wid matarials, widout measure: Widout measure Swater pleasure, Swatest pleasure widout stint.Chorus — Swatest pleasure widout stint! Soothed with his drink, he sang amain: Fought the Saint's battles o'er again And thrice he druv the varmints out and nine times slew the slain. Then saw a master madness rise In reddening cheeks and rolling eyes; So, while another mixin he supplied, He changed his hand; his voice it died, Sinking to a mournful muse, The Spirit did infuse. He sang a Dragon purty good Disturb'd by what he ate, Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen into a wakely state, Rejectin of his food. Refusing at his utmost need The wholesome drink, and off his feed, On the bare earth exposed he lies: The divil a headache shuts his eyes. With downcast glance at empty glass they sate, Revolving in each alter'd soul The various turns of chance below; And one did sigh and sighing stole More whiskey for his woe.Chorus — More whiskey for his woe! Then Master Tim he smiled as he Another noggin mix'd, to see He'd but a kindred sound to move, To lade from pity unto love. Softly swate, in ladian measures, Sang he them to dhreamy pleasures. Life, he sung, 's a wathry bubble; Whiskey, is it worth the throuble? Ending almost when beginning. But his joy who loves a maid is Double, striving for and winning: Think, O think then of the Ladies! Lovely They is sits beside ye: Take the first the Gods provide ye! Then many smash 'their glasses wid applause; But others more particular did pause; And one, unable to conceal his pain, Gazed on the Fair Who caused his care, And sigh'd and look'd, and sidelong look'd, sigh'd, look'd, and sigh'd again, Until wid love and whiskey much opprest, His beautiful head droop'd down on his own manly breast.Chorus — His beautiful head droop'd down on his own manly breast. Now blow the bagpipes wonst again! A noisier yet, and yet a noisier strain! Break his bands of sleep asunder, And rouse him wid a rattlin peal o' thunder! Hark! hark! the horrid sound Has pick'd up his head; He awakes from the dead Drunk and dazed looks around. Thread on his coat! Tim O' Thews cries: That will give him a rise. See the bhoys all uprare Their red heads — in the hair! See the jewels that flash from their eyes! By me sowl, it 's a band, Wid shillalagh in hand, To make ghosts o' the kilt and the slain. Faith, he 's hit him again! Inglorious on the plain, Give the bhoys their due, Will be very few. Behold how they toss their shellalaghs on high! How they jump on each other when down! And the Ladies look on and don't swoun, But admire and applaud wid a 'preshative joy, Till Tim went for the gas-jets in zeal to destroy. Then they led him away. Wid no light for his prey, And no end of hurrahs for a rale Oirish bhoy!Chorus — No end of hurrahs for a rale Oirish bhoy! Thus long ago, Long as his bellows had the wind to blow, Till whiskey made him mute, Tim O' Thews could his bagpipes shute To saintly ire Or praises ov the malt's swate juice or rollicking desire. At last good Father Mathew came And well-nigh squelch'd St. Pathrick's game. The Temprate Saint broke all the worms asthore, Doubled the drinker's narrow bounds, Caught him upon teetotal grounds, And stopp'd his native drink with a pledge unknown before. Yet, ould St. Pathrick! keep thy bays, Or each take half a crown! You druv the sarpients to the says; Both put the whiskey down.Grand Chorus — Put the whiskey down! MERRY HANNAH AT HER KITCHEN RANGE Never say die till you're dead!— Good Old Proverb. With blackest soot the chimney pots Were thickly crusted, one and all: The crock was crusted too, and lots Of soot rubb'd from it blear'd the wall: The unwash'd sherds look'd sad and strange, Odd plates and cups that did not match (He in his cups had smash'd the batch) Scatter'd before the kitchen range. She only said — He just was beery: Where is he now? she said: I wish he would not get so beery; It 's time to be a-bed. And yet she had no tears that even; And all the morning had not cried; She was so used to see her Stephen Beery both morn and eventide. So, after flitting of the bats, Before thick dark did trance the sky, She put the half-darn'd stocking by, And skurried off the neighbours' cats. She only said — Again he 's beery; He cometh not, she said: She said — I guess he 's beery, beery, It 's time to be abed. Upon the middle of the night Waking she heard a rooster crow; And half an hour before the light From her near shed she heard the cow Call to her. Without hope of change Awake she lay, alone, forlorn; So got up earlier than the Morn, And laid a fire in her kitchen range. She only said — It 's very queer he Has not come; she said— He must have been so very beery To sleep out of his bed. About a stone-cast from the wall A ditch through willow-pollards crept, Where poor Lord Stephen had a fall, And lay there since, and snoring slept. Hard by his terrier sate alway, With tender whine or rougher bark: For leagues no other dog did mark A sleepier drunkard where he lay. She only said — I 'd best be cheery; And light the fire, she said: She said —It 's best be always cheery, And not die till you're dead. The sun was getting up, though slow; But the quick winds were up and away: The casement curtain to and fro Swung, and she saw the shadow sway, And thought it was for whom she yearn'd; And look'd, and found it was a sell; And then she went out to the well And fill'd her kettle and return'd. And only said — It 's very queer he Stay'd out all night; she said, But in her thought half put the query, Suppose that he were dead? All day within the dreamy house The doors upon their hinges creak'd; A blue fly rapp'd o' the pane, a mouse Jump'd out, and then she almost shriek'd; Her cat went with her all about; They saw him sneaking through the door, They heard his big boots on the floor, They heard him cursing from without,— Not he. And yet she kept her cheery: He cometh not, she said: She said — He 's beery, very beery: Quite a long drunk, she said. She heard the swallows on the roof, Heard the clock ticking, and the sound A horse made with his hinder hoof Against the fore; she did confound All drunkards once — for half an hour: But when the sun at noon of day Was high, and when the sunbeams lay Quite level, even when night 'gan lower, She held her cheer, would not be dreary, He 'll come some time, she said: It 's best all ways to keep one cheery, And not die till one 's dead. HOW THEY BROUGHT THE NEWS TO A GENT Robert's own rhymes. Bob Browning and Timothy Titcombe and Me Had to take him the news: I was boss of the three, For I strode a donkey, they stump'd. Peggy threw, As we left her front gate, for good luck her old shoe; Then we heard the door slam, and we started abreast. Peggy's ass it was lame, and they ran at their best. Not a word to each other, we just went the pace,— Me and jack soon ahead, then them two in our place. I turn'd in my saddle and made the girths tight, Then shorten'd the stirrups and saw each was right, And the rein-buckle fix'd, though I knew not a whit Would that hard-mouth'd old jackass attend to the bit. 'Twas dinner-time leaving: so when we drew near To the end of the common our stomachs felt queer: There was blackberries there, quite a plenty to see; But Tim said he would not be waiting for me, Though I tried to persuade him the berries was prime; Till Bob bursted out with — We sha'nt have no time. In the mid o' the common out came the hot sun, And I thought that my donkey look'd most overdone, And the thought made me wild as the others ran past; But I wallop'd him well till he gallop'd at last, With ram-headed shoulders a-butting away At Bob, which upset him. And I let him lay. Cross the common Tim weaken'd, but choked out — You Sir! You wait or I 'll lick you. I thought that that were A thing to remember; I saw his weak knees As he stagger'd and leant against one of the trees, Out of wind, and then down on his marrowbones sank And Me and Bob went on, we two in one rank. We kept a round trot: Bob did, so did I, Down the hill, up the next one. But Bob he was dry With the dust. So at that I began for to laugh ('Twas the donkey that work'd, I had leisure to chaff), Till at top o' the next hill Bob's gills they turn'd white, And he dropp'd there, quite blown, with the Gent's house in sight There I left Robert fetching his breath on a stone, And Me and my donkey we rode on alone. I was jolly, I 'd time enough even to wait, If I look'd out behind, between that and the gate; But donkey, it hadn't been all play to him, And I saw, as his head turn'd, his eyeballs were dim. So I slid from my jacket, my cap I let fall, Then stripp'd off my pants, my suspenders, and all But my shirt and my tie, so of weight made him clear, And patted his lean ribs and call'd him a dear, And shouted and holler'd and gave him the wood On his ears and his crupper; and he understood. And next I remember was folk standing round, As I sate with my knees in my shirt on the ground, And all of them praising this donkey of mine, As they fed him with thistles and ask'd me to dine. I was voted a brick too by general consent: But nary a nickel I got from the Gent. THE LAST OF THE HERD THE ORIGINAL DRAFT Was it Lamb, or Coleridge in his offical capacity as one of the Queen's Beefeaters, who suggested the unlikelihood of a small family devouring fifty beeves, and reduced the supply to mutton, as in The Last of the Flock. In distant countries have I been, And yet I have not often seen A healthy man, a man full-grown, Weep in the public roads alone: But such a one, on English ground And in the broad highway I met. Along the broad highway he came; His cheeks with tears were wet. Sturdy he seem'd, though he was sad, And at his heels a bullock lad. He saw me and he turn'd aside, As if he wish'd himself to hide Behind the beast, and did essay With sleeve to wipe his tears away. I dodged him though, and said, My friend! What ails you? wherefore weep you so? —Shame on me, Sir! this bullock here He makes my tears to flow. To-day I fetch'd him: on my word He is the last of all my herd. When I was young, a single man, And after youthful follies ran, Though little given to care and thought, Yet so it was a cow I bought; And other cows from her I raised, As healthy cows as you might see; And then I married, and was rich As I could wish to be: Bullocks and cows I told a score, And every year increased my store, Year after year my stock did grow; And from this one, this single cow, Full fifty cows and bulls I raised, As fine a herd as ever grazed! Some black and white and others red! They throve and we at home did thrive. — This lusty bullock of my store Is all that is alive: And now I care not if we die And perish all of poverty. Six children, Sir! had I to feed,— Hard labour in a time of need! And never one of us touch'd beef. So I from the parish sought relief. They said I was a wealthy man: My cattle on the uplands fed, And it was meet that I should cook My beef before I begg'd for bread. “Do this! how can we give to you,” Said they, “what to the poor is due?” I cook'd a bullock, as they said; My children ate it without bread, And they were healthy with their food. For me, it never did me good. A woeful time it was for me To see my bullocks cut in steaks, The pretty bullocks I had raised All slaughter'd for my children's sakes, And melting tallowly away. Ah me! but I was cow'd that day. Another still! and still another! A little calf — and then its mother! It was a vein that never stopt,— Like blood-drops from my heart they dropt Till thirty were not left alone, My dun cows dribbling one by one; And I may say that many a time I wish'd they all were gone: Reckless of what might come at last Were but the bitter struggle past. Sir! 'twas a precious herd to me, As dear as my own children be: For daily with my growing store I loved my children more and more. Alas! it was an evil time, Cursed with diminished beefiness. I pray'd, yet every day I thought I loved my children less; And every week and every day Cows, bullocks, seem'd to melt away. They dwindled, Sir! sad sight to see! From ten to five, from five to three, A calf, a bullock, and a cow; And then at last from three to two; And of my fifty yesterday I had but only one. And here it follows at my heels: Alas! and I have none. To-day I fetch'd it. Seems absurd, But 'tis the last of all my herd! THE PARROT [WORDS! WORDS! WORDS!] Once, upon a midnight skeery, Like an eagle in his eyrie, In my room, a garret cheery (Reckoning sky-from, the first floor), Lo, I heard a sound of screeching, Like some file a saw beseeching, Or some irate school-ma'am teaching Stupid school-girls —half a score: What can that be? said I inly; Some ill-manner'd wind or bore At my key hole, nothing more. In my chamber, yes! my garret,— Truly I am not a parrot, I don't care a pickled carrot To recall it the first-floor,— I had been — I well remember 'Twas the middle of September, Sure it was, and not November, Because August came before And October after, — so I 'm Certain, I need say no more: I remember, nothing more. I remind me of the ballet: 'Twas “The Vision of the Valet,” I had play'd the part of Sally On the very night before. This an off-night was: I sat there In my room, a-skimming fat there Off some broth, and then so pat there Came the screech against my door, Such a screech, my poor ears splitting Through the key-hole of the door, Screech I never heard before. Haply, thought I, 'tis a neighbour (Friends come in to lighten labour), So my heart play'd pipe and tabor Though the screech near split the door; Then again I thought, what wretched Thing is this so to have fetched Such a screech? My breath I catched Thereat, saying — I implore, Wretch or neighbour! sick or welcome, Cease to split my chamber door! Split my screeched ears no more! Presently my soul grew bolder: Looking round then o'er my shoulder, By this broth, I said, I 'll scold her— Her, I knew that, if no more; And I call'd out — You just stop that Screech! if you don't quickly drop that Screech, by this same broth, I 'll whop that Head of yours off on the floor! At my speech there came a scratching, And the screech-split in the door Stretch'd twice open, then once more. Partly bolden'd by the scratching I began the door unlatching, Only first, in haste upsnatching, Spilt the broth upon the floor; Surely, said I, that the cat is, Couldn't pass the window-lattice, She is hungry, knows the fat is Always her's the skimming o'er; Let my heart be still a moment While this mystery I explore,— It is the cat, and nothing more. Quick the chamber door I flung wide; Puss! puss! puss! I with swift tongue cried, Or had, but my tongue, it hung dried, For no cat was at the door: But — before me stood a creature On one leg,— it was the Screecher: Well I knew then every feature Of a bird — Not that of yore, The Raven, Cat-bird then or harpy? What! a lark? No! at my door Was a Parrot, nothing more. But no common parrot, bet you! No such bird had ever met you Though in the Brazils they set you Plump upon that parrot shore: Blazing brilliant in his plumage, That had surely devil-groomage, Like a Jap in it's first bloomage, Stamp'd. wlth colours, three or four. Like a pansy grown to feathers So that it might live all weathers, Proving Darwin's belle of whethers, How the less becomes the more: Pansy-parrot, flower of yore. Why, my last new Sunday bonnet Has not finer feathers on it, Though for taste — my word upon it! Better than a bird e'er wore: French, surpassing parrot fashion: It would move a saint's compassion (Though indeed I may be rash on Saints, I 've known but three or four) For such feathers to be worn on Parrot bodies. Well, no more! But they were feathers at the door. Such this Parrot was that, screeching Of his gentlest, hung beseeching, Sucking-dove-like, and outreaching For the handle of my door: Till my heart; to all things tender, Made to him complete surrender, And I said — I can but lend or Give the entrance you implore; Pray, Sir! enter, screech and feathers! Then I open'd wide the door, And I gave my guest the floor. Though I held the door wide open, This strange bird would sidle, slope in, Just as if he wanted scope in Getting through the chamber door; Then, O Babel, Babelmandel! The wild beast flew in the candle, And then hung on to the handle Of my, — a Lady's chamber door, Claw'd and whirl'd nine times around it, Round the knob inside the door: 'Twill unscrew, a little more. Now I 'm fond of all dumb critturs, Beast or bird, crawls, flies or flitters, Cat whose glaring eyeball glitters, Pig, or puppy blind no more; But a dumb thing that still screeches With an echo that outreaches, I would say to Plymouth beach, is Worse than even the dumbest bore: And he screech'd and stopp'd not screeching And I stopp'd my ears before— Dear! no! he took breath, and swore. I had dropp'd down in my rocking Chair, in hope to mend a stocking While he stay'd, when such a shocking Word came from his repertoire; Swiftly then as thought allow'd me, Fears and feelings getting crowdy, I at him the stocking throw'd; he Never winced, but from the door, From the knob he whirl'd on leaning, Snatch'd it, and again he swore: Darn'd, he said, and nothing more. And since then, since when I threw it (I 'm so sorry I could do it), Nothing I can say unto it Takes this creature from my door: On the door-knob he sits rocking, Whirling, with his beak i' the stocking, Muffling screeches, and half mocking Screeches, swearing, Darn'd! no more. But meseems that 's very shocking: Darn'd! darn'd! darn'd! and evermore That word flung in at my door. There this Parrot, ever whirling Still is swirling, still is twirling, Till my hair forgets its curling, Horrent at the foul uproar; And he hurls his screeches shocking Through a big hole in the stocking, Screeching in his parrot mocking Just the oath I said before. There he hangs from night till morning, My unhappy door adorning— If the landlord gives me warning He 'll not let me pass the door: Darn'd! darn'd! darn'd! for evermore. THE CUMBERLAND STILE [NOT IN THE COLLECTED WORKS] I stood with Robin at the four-barr'd stile: Robin on one side, I stood on the other. We only stood there a brief kissing-while, For Robin, you may know, is not my brother. Rob measures six feet, taking off his shoes; They call me Little Joan because I 'm small; Rob ask'd to kiss me; how could I refuse Him stooping down to me? he is so tall. I gave him back his kiss: it was not right, I thought, to take his kiss and give him none. 'Twas evening time, not dark, nor yet so light, Not light for folk to notice what was done. Rob set me on the top bar of the stile, His arm was round me. Rob is not my brother. We only stay'd there just a kissing-while: Is it not good we should kiss one another? OUR RIDE MILLER CORRECTED, BY OLD REVELS We was out on the prairies— Jo. Miller and me And the girl. So far true! There was only us three. “And Kit Carson?” O no! All of that is a lie. Take the truth of old Revels, the man Jo. “saw die!” This is how it all happen'd. The girl, she was — Well, We 'd play'd for her, Jo. and me. Dern'd but I'll tell The truth all clean out. We had been at the lodge Of her father. He's all-free, is Jo. for a dodge, And had trick'd — But, no matter! you only would learn The rights o' that ride when we 'scaped from the burn, For we all three got through. It was only a skeer, And the girl a bit scorch'd. Master Jo. didn't keer A red cent was she burnt or unburnt: that's the one Touch of truth in the vagabond's tale of the run. For the rest, he was gassing. All that about Kit,— Why, I tell you again, it 's a lie, all of it. Kit Carson would never have left in distress A friend, nor a stranger, a girl too. Ask Jess,— Well, I 'm rough: I mean Madam our general's wife. Bless you, she knew Kit Carson the whole of his life. I'll read you her letter: just wait till I get Where she says that Jo. Miller 's a liar, you bet. Needn't tell you he 'll gas: all us know how he gasses. Let that go! As we lay half asleep in the grasses We saw that the prairie was all in a flame; And the smoke druv before as right on us it came. We jump'd on our horses, we only had two; And Jo. took the best. Now don't say So would you! Though may be I would, for the girl had to ride, And as he had won her and call'd her his bride 'Twas for him to look for her. He leapt in the saddle And — blest but the mean crittur went to skedaddle And leave her, but she was too spry for the varmint And clim up behind with a grip on his garment, So holding him fast, with both arms round his waist. He had flung her off then, but was too much in haste. So we start. What the — “gold-mounted Colt's”! Nary one Had we got. And we stript? The hell, you poke fun At a fellow. The fire was upon us; suppose We 'd stop to be singed while we took off our clothes? We just went as we were, with the fire at our backs, And lost no fool's time, nor no words, to make tracks. Their horse was the best, by long odds, but for load: So I kept close beside them, and onward we rode Well ahead of the fire. 'Twas no great thing to fear, But that lying scoundrel was bound for a skeer; And I saw, as the girl only loosen'd her grip, He was ready and, shifting her hand from his hip, Twist her off and, one moment, she lay on the sward. He turn'd to look at her, then spurr'd on more hard. Damn your soul, you — I leant to catch hold of his rein But miss'd and I knew there was no hope to gain On that beast, so I pull'd in my own; you may bet She was not long awaiting. One moment to get On the crupper, one look of her thanks in my face, And we were again making head in our race With the fire. And we beat. There is no more to say. You see I 'm not dead. Nor the girl. To this day I 've not set eyes on Jo. Yes! perhaps it 's as well. If he meets me, or Betsy, you bet he gets hell. MAUD MULLER AGAIN [LATEST INTELLIGENCE] Maud muller on a summer's day Raked the meadow sweet with hay. And so far all of us agree: Whittier and Bret Harte with me. The rest — Well, only the other day I call'd at the House. I need to say No name but, knowing the family well, Can best inform you how all befell. The Judge did marry her: so Harte 's right, But very far wrong of the after plight. And the Whittier needed not his moan For the left or the poorer leaving one. The Judge was also a man of will: So turn'd where Maud was raking still, And on the wind with the scent o' the grass Fragranter words of love did pass; And ever the hay was housed in hold A llttle circle of purest gold — His mother's, with just one amethyst, Was on the finger the young Judge kiss'd. No Lord of Burleigh he whose pride Stoop'd to make a peasant his bride; But a good republican who knew The growth of a woman simple and true, A woman whose sons might be real men, Such as trod on the old hills when The Sons of Heaven came down to earth, And giants sprang of heavenly birth. Poor and low may be yet not rough: Harte should have better known the stuff Granite and heaven can make out West, Due East too when we take the best. Better than Saratoga knows — Fashion'd of only whims and clothes. Her kin were honest and goodly folk: What if some with an accent spoke? If they hadn't a many fine words tu hum, What is that to the poor outcome From hearts, that are only diamond dust Harden'd under the upper crust, Of those who the human engine shunt Out of life in a brown stone front? This is perhaps o'erflow of spleen: But the thing I want to say, and mean Is this:— The Judge was a judge of life When he took a healthy woman to wife; And Maud, whatever her kith and kin, Was a woman worth a man's while to win. They lived together long years of joy; Fair girls and more than one sturdy boy Our happy Maud to her husband bore. Long ere their heads were silver'd o'er None could have told that higher birth Was his or whose the more native worth: For the soul of a queen inform'd her face And gave to her every motion grace; And the haughtier Judge's dignified mien Mated but well with her port serene. Health she brought to a stock outworn: And all of his sons were gentle born; And her girls had grace to keep their share Of the proud old family's beauty rare, And she and her lover the lesson taught, How Love and Nature have ever wrought, Raising the low, redeeming the high, With strength and beauty for marriage tie. Sad are the words — It might have been: And sadder whenever the will was mean. But a cheerier thought may leap the bar To what may be from the things that are. BALLAD OF A CERTAIN C. KING AND A BEGGAR MAID QUEEN Cophetua king in the days now gone Lived in a brick house, all alone: 'Twas a red brick house just over the way With a lean-to beside for a one-horse shay. Cophetua King leant over his gate, Smoking his pipe in his kingly state; “Give me a penny, kind Sir!” she said,— The beggar maid of whom you have read. She was only a beggar girl; But her cheek was red and her hair did curl, And she stept with a lively hinge in her gait Noticing King in his kingly state. The day it was hot, a day of drouth; Cophetua took the pipe from his mouth; One glance he gives to the beggar's eyes, Scarcely a wink, and the girl replies. Cophetua King thought — Odd's my life! I reckon I'd like this lass for a wife. So he wiped his lips and proffer'd a kiss, Like saying — Madam! you 're not amiss. The girl she was simple enough to frown Till the King he promised her half a crown. It was little perhaps for a wedding gift, But the Queen was one with a single shift. The tale is most true: for I 've heard say, In the red brick house there over the way King and his beggar Queen still reside,— And a one-horse shay if she likes to ride. THE FASHIONS AN ODE When beauty, heavenly made, was young (Time since round Eve the fig-leaves hung) The Fashions had no wares to sell: Young Beauty's charms were known too well. Awaking, sleeping, active, fainting, She needed nought of Fashion's painting: Health to her rounded cheek gave bloom, And freshness was her one perfume; For stays and suchlike woman gear She had no heed, she had no fear; For whalebones to support her round She cared not, and her lungs were sound. No thought had she for “taste” or “art,” Nor dream'd that dress would make her smart, Till (for Madness ruled that hour) The Fashions came to bring her dower. First Love, his loving skill to try, Pluck'd the wild blossoms, and essay'd With trembling hands, he knew not why, To weave a garland for his maid. Then rush'd in Vanity, on fire To invent and do more daring things, That all might envy and admire; And hung her neck with beaded strings. What woeful measures rend the air? What shriek is that from Nature's Child? Poor Nose! the ring is pendant there. The savage mother saw and smiled. But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair, What was thy delightful measure? Still it whisper'd promised pleasure And bade the lovely ornaments All hail! Still would her touch the strain prolong That held o'er natural defects a veil. She made the feet grow less, the ears more long; And when a beauteous form she chose, She hid the native grace in any length of clothes. And Hope enchanted smiled and waved her golden hair. And longer had she smiled, but with a frown More rampant Folly rose, And tore the old Greek robes in tatters down, And with a withering look The shape-distorting corset took And pull'd and pull'd at every thread. Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe! And ever and anon her feet Set to the back, to make it meet. And though at times each labour'd breath between Pains-taking Beauty to her side Her supplicating hands applied, Yet still did Folly's purpose supervene, While each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from her head. Fashion! thy freaks to nought were ever fix'd, Sad proof of thy distressful state! On different modes thy veering wills get mix'd, And what thou affectest now is what thou scorn'dst of late, With eyes upraised as one inspired, Another Fashion walk'd, attired In robes too scanty much to meet; While her high heels, a daring feat, Drove down the narrow shoes her crippled toes, And one stuck small black patches round Her lips and nose, as if unsound; And later Fashions came as strange as those. Some scented in a sort of hybrid way, Round a perfumed air diffusing, Rose or musk or other choosing: No flowers ever stank as they. Among them paced a sprightlier scented one, Hight Full-Dress, nymph-like (some said), pale of hue: Nothing across her shoulders flung, Her jewel'd bust exposed to view, And an imposing air, and voice that loudly rung A hunter's call,— to Nymph or Faun unknown, To oak-crown'd Sisters or their chaste-eyed Queen. Satyrs and sylvan boys were seen. Low peeping there, the jolly green Were exercised, the staider thought it queer; But Sport leapt up and laugh'd and gave a cheer. Last came Joy's ecstatic trial, When with faltering step advancing, And Grecian Bend, the Hump was fully dress'd. One might as well embrace a physic vial, Or a lay figure — which perhaps were best. They who of old admired the virgin train In Tempe's vale, and saw her native maids Amidst the festal sounding shades To some unwearied minstrel dancing, While as his flying fingers kiss'd the strings Love framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round, With tresses flowing loose and zone unbound, Might wonder if such earnest play Could be attempted in this Grecian day By our poor hump'd and high-heel'd fashionable things. O Beauty! heaven-descended Maid! Friend of Fashions, duty paid! Why, Goddess! unto us denied Lay'st thou thy pristine grace aside? As in that loved Athenian bower Unbent thou held'st supremest power, Thy form, O Mimic most endear'd! Appear now as it then appear'd, Where was thy native simple part, Devote to Virtue, Truth, and Art. Arise as in that Golden Time, Warm, energetic, chaste, sublime! Thy wonders in that glorious age Fill thy recording Sister's page: 'Tis said, and I believe the tale, Thy lightest smile did more avail Than all the wiles our schools enact. Thou unadorn'd didst more attract Than all the modern trappings bound A spoil'd and tramell'd figure round. O, bid such vain endeavours cease! Revive the pure design to please; And once again in simple state Attract our love, escape our hate! THE BURGLAR Lady! untaught and without leisure, Where gat you this heroic measure? Wordsworth He was a brick! It may be said Over my noble Burglar — dead. Dead as a herring and — “well hang'd!” I know not. Though at times he bang'd My head about — when he was tight (I 've had his marks a full fortnight), He was kind to me out of drink (I don't care what some folk may think) And gentle as a wild cat is When wild cats one another kiss. He was a brick! I say again. Let worse men contradict: that 's plain. Plain as a stale unbutter'd roll. I loved my Burglar — on my soul! And many an eve when he had plann'd To crack a crib with his own hand, I have said — Jem! do not go to-night! Jem Walker was my master hight. They call'd him Conrad too beside. But no Gullnary was his bride Save only me, Dora 's my name: He call'd me Dolly all the same. He loved me well: he swore my mouth Was roses that had been grow'd South; And said, though he met unawares No end of angels on the stairs, Wide-open-mouth'd to meet his lips, That nary one of them 'd eclipse This mouth of mine. He would not kiss The lips of that Semira miss (A girl, he said, loved him long since) Not if the queen made him a prince, Instead of mine. So wonder not I loved him. And though you may blot His record with an ugly word, He was a brick. Yes! that 's the third. And you had loved him, sitting thar Smoking,— he cared for his cigar; Had loved him for his level brows And eyes — No! not a bit like cows'; Yea! loved him for his manly mouth, Too often drooping in the drouth; And for that sinewy crow-bar, His arm, more nimble-finger'd far Than any arm you ever knew. A vice-like grip his hand had too, A grip that left the griped part blue. And who would shape a Hercules, Looking on limbs and thews like these (I seem to feel them once again) Had tried to match their brawn in vain, Ay! though he built a shrine thereat. And for his spirit: talk of that! A spirit that would surge and swell And lash and boom like — why, like hell. Samoa's heaving seas be blown, Wreck'd, toss'd, himself a sea alone. What strange goat-bearded men were they Who came to him at close of day! Men whom you gave the widest berth; Whose histories, if they were told, Would make the hearer's blood run cold; Men who were often run to earth, But seldom caught, or caught broke loose. Men with Goliath's, Samson's thews, Men of the olden iron time When war and rapine were sublime, Men cursed for every crime and vice Except the one of cowardice. They came, the troop of bearded men, That eve, and rested in our room. But when the night was thick with gloom They took a parting drink, and then Went one by one into the town. What for? I ask'd. Jem, with a frown, Bade me shut up, and follow'd them. I heard the slamming of the door, Shut with an oath, and nothing more. And thought what matter'd it to me? And said — they 've gone out on a spree. And I was anxious about Jem. He held his head down very low, A streak of sadness in his air: Then silent touch'd my yellow hair And took the long locks in his hand, Toy'd with them, smiled, and let them go; And made a sort of awkward bow — And said some words — I hear them now— Of Conrad taken, and the how. He led us up the marble steps: He led, his jemmy in his hand, And closed the door, when down there leaps, Down the hall stairs, an armed band. Though coming on us unprepared, We bore ourselves as men who dared; Burst through the door and in the gap Fought rat-like to escape the trap. Then hot to barter life for life Did Walker thrust his trusty knife Through the first man and to the stone, The brown stone of the outer wall, Stuck him upright: he could not fall, Upheld there by the knife alone. I never saw my man again. Long time in quod for burglary And murder,— so they said to me; And hope to get him off was vain. He swung upon the gallows-tree: An easy death, with not much pain. Speak ill or well of him, he died In all disgrace. Say of the Dead — His heart was black, his hands were red; But add — the Law was satisfied. The captain of a pirate's deck, He might have slain his hundred men; A conqueror, he had murder'd then His thousands, made some land a wreck, And won like his great namesake praise From “poet” lips: but evil days He fell upon, and lieth there In his low grave, with none to care — But one, the widow that he left. And she,— her heart is sorrow-cleft. Yet was he mean'd for better things, had wrong Not warp'd him early, crook'd him right along. Perchance had any taught, the man had known Some better way of living than the one He took with no more feeling of remorse Than redder Walker o'er an Indian's corse. Perchance — O vainly curious fool! be still! The man did but his destiny fulfil Mark'd out from childhood. Ruffian if he were, A woman loved — and loves him, whose despair Has raised the Felon's simple monument. She faithful spite of all, on grief intent, Mourneth the wretch none may lament beside. A SPANISH LADY'S LOVE WORDSWORTH WITH SWINBURNE You have heard of a Spanish Lady: How she would an Englishman; How, lest fond arms should persuade, he From her loving grip outran: Hear now what he said, such grace had he Who would not countenance her love, in no degree. Cold eyelids that hide like a jewel Warm glances! hard eyes for an hour Seeming soft! O most gentle and cruel Young Englishman, conscious of power — But he answer'd — The man you adore is A husband, mayn't marry again: So it 's best he should leave you, Dolores! Young Lady of Spain! O most gallant Captain! have pity! Though thy wives they were seventy times seven, Yet leave me not here in this city, Still sighing for thee unforgiven — But he answer'd — Albeit at core he 's A Mormon and knows not disdain, They 'd not have you at Rydal, Dolores! Sweet Lady of Spain! I am lovely and youthful and tender, And love is likewise my desert: When my hope comes to you in its splendour, Will you call cold despair for my hurt? — But he answer'd — By all thy soft glories, Though I love and to wed you were fain, 'Twould be bigamy. That 's so, Dolores! Fair Lady of Spain! Ah, beautiful passionless body That never has ached with a heart! Ay, kill me! your hands will be bloody; But love me before you depart! — But he answer'd — The love you implore is Not mine: must I tell you again I 've a wife, and strong-minded, Dolores! Fond Lady of Spain! By the hunger for change and emotion, By the thirst for impossible things, If you leave me, across the wide ocean My love will pursue on swift wings. — But he answer'd — A love gone before is The oftenest follow'd in vain: You 'll be safer at home, my Dolores! Dear Lady of Spain! O God of moist seasons and moister! By the pearls on these hot cheeks of mine, Would that I were the pearl of an oyster So he were that bivalve divine! — But he answer'd — The sea I pass o'er is Too stormy for natives: your gain Would be peril, not pearl, dear Dolores! Bold Lady of Spain! Yet break from the bonds that have girt you, And sunder your spirit from clay! Renounce your sub-Rydaline virtue! My father will give me away. — But he answer'd — At Rydal my store is: I go home: no use to complain. Yet I leave you my heart, my Dolores! Loved Lady of Spain! So he left the lovely lady. But he took her chain of gold And her bracelets two, which laid he Down before his helpmate old: Saying smiling,— Presents these for thee. I do not tell my wife who gave them unto me.

IZAAK TAILOR TWO PENN'ORTH O' PROVERBS “Five bunches a penny, Sweet Lavender!” London Cries INTRODUCTION I Martin am, the most enlighten'd Fàkir. Rightly pronounce my name, good folk! and hark here! I wisdom have, although my verses are queer. 1— OF ENDS PROVERBIAL Like to a needle whose point protrudes from the side of a hay-stack, So is the proverb's end, keen but unseen by the eyes of the thousand. Is it the fault of the proverb? Rather the thousands' when they, slack To sight any meaning at all, would miss even a four story house-end. 2— OF TRUSTING IN PROVERBS Put not your whole trust in proverbs even if Solomon seal them! Holes may be pick'd on both sides; in a third may be hollow and wrangle: As this — that keen eyes has Charity, sometimes tho' lashes conceal them. The same was made known to the soldier, for forty tied to the triangle. 3— OF IDLE PRAYING Pax vobiscum! said one to the pedlars, not buying of their wares. So is the soap-less woman would clean her house with the noise and th' esteam of prayers. 4— OF GROUNDS OF PROPHECY A duck laid — an egg (with a hen) that her chicken would turn out a duckling; And it took to the water at once. So a man not a dunce Is much the best fitted for prophet, and a dern'd sight more certain of chuckling. 5— OF WISDOM ALWAYS Every goose counts for sage in due season; the wise one is wise in all weathers; And the wiser may keep himself warm when the fool has been pluck'd of his feathers. 6— OF A DRUNKARD The drunkard hath swallow'd a leak: wherefore is his thirst never sated. Truly the sire of the Danaids this father of sieves may be rated. Through the whole of his life he perceives how man's debts may be all liquidated. 7— OF WOMAN Says David — The virtuous woman is good as a crown to her gaffer; Says Emerson — Happen what may, compensation will probably follor. Good balanceth Evil, albeit the rate of exchanges may differ: Out of Concord the woman not virtuous her holder may rate as a dolour. 8— OF THE WAYS OF INFERIORS It is well, as old Isaac (not Walton) Observes, to be duly observant of the ways of inferior beasts. Is the Ant (Go to, Sluggard!) at fault in His store for his Thanksgiving Feasts? Shall Man, the beasts' hub, Be less wise than a web-footed Spider? Now sit thou beside her, And learn — Will they teach us? the beasts. There's the rub. 9— OF MEANS AND NATURE Though an ass bray in a mortar, yet will the shell not depart; Though a nut 's stript to the kernel, all the same it 's a nut at the heart. Means, I remark, may be many: only do thou choose the right! Nature is one and eternal: her robes fitting loosely or tight. 10— OF TEACHING Thou canst not hope thy fellow's thought to shape to fit thy frame: The brain, yea! of the veriest Ape shall escape thy spinal notions. Wherefore though I should write a book thy need may skip the same: Leaving my words as weeds, flung from my mind's vast oceans. CAUDLE CUPS [A DOMESTIC IDYLL] The speakers' names in this poem are abbreviated as follows: For C. read Caudle For Mrs. C. read Mrs. Caudle Enter from the Club Ferry Caudle, “quite sober.” Caudle —My Dear! Mrs. C. Well, Jerry! C. I say well, my dear! What have you two — you 'nd Jenny been 'nd done With the — with the I say — thstreetdoor key,— I mean the keyhole?

Lay hold o' th' bannisters! I 'll keep you up. — Well, if you will sit down on the stairs, I must. But it is time for bed. You 're drunk, Elithabeth! THE END OF CHILDHOOD [A PROSE POEM] After the manner of Mistress Baabauld Child of artificiality!— whence comèst thou? Thy nose is red with thy dyspepsia, and the curvature of thy spine increaseth daily. I come, O my Mamma! from sweet perusal of a tale of good children, and from other rambles through the Magazine of the Daughter of good King Herod. Truly therein have I found much edificatien and a fostering of a desire for my improvement. I come, O my Mamma! from mailing a conundrum for the Magazine of St. Herodias. And also I have written, O my Mamma! a poem to appear in the forthcoming issue. Finally I come from founding The Good Children's Society, against abuse of the whole inferior creation; and your daughter, O my Mamma! has been elected President of the same. Is not this my ninth birthday? O dearest Mamma! Is it not time I was enrolled among the doers? I come from instructing my ignorant grandparent in the improved method of withdrawing the albumenous particles from a gallinaceous deposit. I come from thankfully reflecting on the happiness of my own youth.. O dearest Mamma! the Magazine of the Daughter of good King Herod was not printed in your childhood. Sweet is knowledge, O my Mamma! sweeter even than either gum or goodies, or than a large amount of the best maple candy. And I looked. And that Mother laid her Child on the lap of her motherly solicitude. There was wailing. Also the Child wept. The face of that Child was hidden from me. What I saw rejoiced me exceedingly. Verily, I said, there is yet a Mother in Israel. Haply a remnant that has not bowed down to the Baalambs. TO A SPIDER Spider! Spider! hid from sight Till some hapless fly alight, What fore-thoughtful brain and eye Fashion'd thy web's nice symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Grew those rare geometries? In what far-off home of fire Forgèd was that slender wire? And what cunning, what wise art, Stow'd all in so small a part, Prompt to weave and to repeat, And gave thee such nimble feet? Not the stars, through myriad years Traveling in appointed spheres, Tell more surely of design Than that frail web's curious line. What the hand and what the brain Made thee, and made not in vain? Did he smile thy craft to see? Did he who made the Fly make thee? Spider! Spider! hanging light On thy web but seen dew-bright, What fore-thoughtful brain and eye Framed that fearful symmetry? BUDDHA If the read writer think he writes, Or if the reader think he reads, He knows not half their subtil sleights Whose written rede is writ in deeds. Read or unread to me is clear, Downside or up to me the same, The words between the lines appear, And understanding is my game. They reckon ill who leave me out, I am the writer's, reader's wings, My voice both whisper is and shout, And silence is the hymn it sings. True knowledge hath with me abode, One word to me is more than seven, But thou, vain thinker! fling thy load And mount upon my back to heaven! THE BEE (CORISCA — NERINA — HYLAS) CORISCA Help me, Nerina! it has stung me. NERINA Where? I see: your lip swells. Dear! I know a charm My mother taught me,— only you must share Its utterance. Silly child! it will not harm, But heal you almost in a moment. — There! Are not you out of pain? HYLAS Help! help! the bee Has stung me too. Nerina! have some ruth! NERINA His lip 's not swell'd: and yet — I would not he Should suffer — Hylas! let me go! In sooth You kiss too close, and leave the sting with me. QUATRAINS The fly that thought he turn'd the coach-wheel round Lies crush'd between the iron and the ground: As silently the wheel revolves again, Must some memorial of the Fly be found? What are we? Grains of the wide Desert's sand; Or as mere rain-drops shaken from Time's hand Into the Ocean. Shall the swallow'd drop Pretend the Ocean-Heart to understand! We live, and work, and through our little day Our parts conspicuous or unnoticed play: Some brief Hours may remember us, and then Oblivion passeth o'er us on its way. THE KINGS' WAKE [A SURPRISE PARTY] Good fellows were they all Who toward Tom King's that winter evening hied, To give friend King a call: With drink — they said 'twas fair — and likewise meat supplied. When leaves nor shade nor strew the street, And underneath unresting feet The crunch'd crisp snow we hear, When in high heaven the stars are hung So bright they seem like diamonds strung To grace the new-come Year, We have a custom like the snow To go a-drifting, to and fro, Among our friends: The when we never let them know, But for amends With baskets and caskets Their tables we throng, And bottles, with throttles Impatient for song. This party was of various clime: Beshrew me, they were worthy rhyme As any of that antique time Your laureate sings. Surprises may not be sublime,— But kings are kings. King (Tom), of royal heart was he, And this same day from o'er the sea Came home: is any doubt that we Shall be well-come? His Wife too 'd like us to make free And feel “tu hum.” So thought our party:—but ere they're astir It may be well to note the kind o' folk they were. Chief of the gang was Enoch, tall and dry, Square-shoulder'd, hatchet-faced, lank-hair'd, and spry: He said Vermont had raised him; others said He was a right New-Yorker, thorough bred. Wherever borh, a level head had he, And spake outside his nose sonorously. Not quite his height was Bull, but fleshier far, And ruddy-cheek'd as Baldwin apples are, With somewhat of a mid protuberance: Yet was he strong and active, and could dance With any girl, and sing in tones so sweet Two or three bars would take you off your feet: Well-featured, with curl'd hair of chestnut hue, And all good in him like a chestnut too. The third was a young German, Ernest call'd By friends: he wore green spectacles, was bald, And beardless, but full pleasant was his face, With kind blue eyes his glasses did disgrace: His figure short, much rounded, not ill-made: Serene his look, and his demeanour staid, And all unlike the Frenchman at his side, Brave Monsieur Jean Belleisle, quick, lively-eyed, And windmill-action'd when he 'gan to talk. Three steps to Ernest's two he took in his walk, Yet hardly kept pace with him. Behind them Sandy McIvor came, a man of phlegm And moods sarcastic,—but he mean'd no harm: A hard dry-manner'd Scot, but with a warm Leal spirit Always he was arm in arm With Denis 'Shaughnessy, his other self, His supplement: for Denis was an elf, Frolicsome, careless, noisy, and o'errun With mirth and jest and unrelenting fun, As champagne flasks are overflow'd with froth. Certes this boy had fun enough for both Himself and Sawney: all with pure intent And consciènce. He shouted as he went And gambol'd like the Bedlamkin he was. This was the jovial crowd that mean'd to pass A quiet night with King, their old-time friend; And, as the fashion bade, a grace to lend To their intrusion, take with them their treat, Some drink material, some odd things to eat: Mere punkin-pies and strawberry-jam short-cake, An oyster stew, and eke a fair clam-bake (“Unseasonable,” but then for friendship's sake): These their regalia. Beside these they bore Crackers and cheese and goodies, a good store, And fixins whereof rooster-tails are made, Apples for Jack, and herald-like display'd A mighty demijohn French—Dame Jeanne. upheld on high As if they thought to flout the temperate sky; And from their pockets out-poked many a neck Of bottles label'd variously. What reck We of the labels till the corks are out? By now the party passes, with a shout, Through King's front gate; he, having drawn aside His window-curtain, look'd forth and espied His pied acquaintance hammering at his door, Clamorous to enter. Did I say before He had that day from a long voyage return'd? And in his early chamber the light burn'd. Scarcely a-bed was he when all this din As of police or burglars breaking in, And he must rise and don his wearied clothes (His bettermost suit unpack'd yet, I suppose) To welcome these invaders, and with thanks: Welcome as sudden floods that o'er low banks Some unexpected thaw with thankless heat Has brought unwanted. On his naked feet Descends he, and assists them to a light; Then turns to put him in more gueslly plight. So enter they. And in a little while King and his Wife bring down a cheerful smile To help the gas; and all the game's a-blaze. Bull first gave tongue: Why, this is like old days. I said we could not come too soon. Leastways, Chimed Enoch, Nary one of us could wait. Too soon? said Denis: shure it's most too late. But pardon, Gentles! I have left too long Our hostess standing these wild men among. A jolly dame King's Better-half, though young: With a sweet mouth and a sweet saucy tongue. Well could she meet the wags at any hour. She came in blooming, fresh as the may-flower, No one had thought that she could be so quick; And, leaning on her husband as a stick, Gave greeting to each unexpected guest, To each her hand, with proffer of the best. The flre was not yet out; would they but sit And wait a while. More silent King; but lit A spill for all in turn. Not fluent of speech Was he, but of most things within his reach Could give account: a fidgety small man, Restless, although 'twas said he never ran,— His gait as suited one whose thoughts were wise: He saw no gain in hurried exercise. Wrizled his face was, his jaw lean; so thin His body too, there was no room for sin If any had suspected him of it. But they who knew th' inside knew there was wit With guilelessness beneath that wrinkled crust. He was a man you might both love and trust: (Might is a wrong word here, I would say must). Grave as he was he could accept a joke; And gravely smiled when Bull the night-hours woke, As 'bacco-laureate for the present time, With hasty snatch like this of Moorish rhyme. I know by the smoke all so gracefully curl'd Round the mouth o' the meerschaum that Lone Jack is lit, And I say, if there's peace to be found in the world With a chimney that smokes, this is it! this is it! And here, if the wine may have leave to come forth We mad devils have brought into this blissful sphere, We would pledge to our Host truest service and love, And the same to our Hostess most charming and dear. With leave, Tom! (Bull went on to say) I will move (As he uncork'd the Clicquot) we start fair with this. And I think you will own, if good wine's to be had, Here it is! here it is! And now, the snow-white damask spread, The viands in fit order placed, With Enoch at the table's head, Tom at his right, the left side graced By Madam — “next his heart” (So Denis for his part Apostrophising as the rest took seats), They pass'd around the dainty meats, The sandwiches of chaff and wine. Admit the chaff is not cut fine: Say badinage! when hearts are young Some waggery's allow'd: the tongue Serves as salt-cellar. While I prate These chafferers empty every plate; And having fully bribed their throats Prepare for warbling. Take we notes! Of course Bull must lay down the law. The Scot remonstrates: Hoot awa! Let me begin! A hieland laddie I was born: A' laaland laws I haud in scorn— Denis breaks in— Och! I was born in Liverpool, And I hate the English laws, For me father was an Irishman: Shure I've the plinty cause. Then Bull, half wroth, with look to make a pause, Be hangd t' ye both! we'll have no politics. Choose other singing! Denis! do you mix! Perhaps Miss Belle will favour us the first With her sweet voice? Whereat a general burst, Applause! Miss Belle bow'd gracefully at this. How came she of the party? I shall miss Her song to tell. A winsome lassie she, Like yet unlike her sister Queen: some see No likeness, Belle being little, as yet slim: If scant of fun, without caprice or whim, And all straight-forward as an arrow is: A maiden many have to love, I wis.— Unhesitating, although used to sing, She trill'd unquaveringly a pretty thing Of love — a man's love-song: it is the way Young virgins teach shy bachelors what to say. That over, praised, Bull clear'd his ample throat, And stuck his thumbs in sleeve-holes of his coat, And closed his eyes, and lay back in his chair, And gave as his opinion Jane was fair But cruel, and his heart was breaking fast, Nigh sixteen stone. And when that woe was past Enoch, all asking, led a college chaunt sublime (Writ by the Sage of Concord in the days Of studious youth and more poetic haze): How the Bull-Frog and the Squirrel Had a quarrel, both one time. 'Twas a mountain of a bull-frog (quite an Og Of Bashan, said our Englishman): the mess Was Squirrel he was riled to be thought less Than this mud-mounting bully of a frog. But here's the strain:— Bull-Frog and Squirrel, turn and turn again. The Bull-Frog and the Squirrel came to blows, Metaphoric: and Skug hit him on the nose.Chorus— In among the sedges, On the edges Where the bull-frogs doze. Then Bull-Frog revenged him: Little Put! You wish you was amphibious. Shade of Phut!Chorus— In among the sedges, The green edges. Who the bull-frog's Phut? Phut was that Egyptian who of frogs first ate, When Moses made them cheap, I calculate.Chorus— In among the sedges, On the edges Of a China plate. Then the Squirrel took his tale up, parabole: Says he — You have a mean and muddy soul!Chorus— 'Mid the dirty sedges On the edges Of the Bull-Frog's hole. You sing? you a bull-frog? you? you're hoarse. Whereat the Bull-Frog croak'd again with forty bull-frog force.Chorus— In among the sedges, All their edges Bow'd to him of course. But Skug in half a second him upshut With — You're not spry enough to crack a nut.Chorus— Down among the sedges, On the ledges Where the Bull-Frog's mouth is shut. Needs not be said, at every pause in this Glasses get emptied, while the refill'd kiss, Lip against lip, as custom stands with friends. The punch was excellent. A good punch lends A fillip to enjoyment. Let them hunch Teetotal shoulders! Tea, well put in punch, Helps temperance, corrects the spirituous part, And cheer'd by it gives warmth unto the heart. Try tea with lemon-juice! a little bit Of sugar added: there's no harm in it. Good lemon aids the tea. Nor is there wrong In some stomachic, taken not too strong. But pass the punch! We wait another song. Our hostess call'd the German forth: She knew that he had quires of worth. He blush'd, but said he vould sing den (The air it vos by Beethoven) A German Lied, perhaps vould please, Translated by an English pen. They vould not mind his qs and ps. Silently, silently, did they embrace, Tenderly, tenderly, face illumed face, Deliciously beam'd her sweet passionate eyes: Fondly confiding the maiden's embrace. Woe for the prize of love easily won! Dark is the nightfall that follows the day. Silently, silently, did they embrace, Gloomily, gloomily, face shadow'd face, Despairingly gleam'd her sweet sorrowful eyes: Sadly, despairingly, did she embrace. Hastily flies the love easily won! Summer has gone and the winter is grey. It's nae so hamely, to my mind, As our ain sangs. Ye ken that one Of Bonnie Poll, a screed of Burns. So Sandy, off fu' yet some turns; And scarcely waiting for his wind, Ere they had ask'd he had begun. Fetch me anither stoup of ale, And froth it in the pewter tassie, That I may drink — I wadna fail — A health to her, my ain wee lassie. The snaw it drives atween my teeth, The cauld keen wind is na so jolly, It's cozie here the neuk beneath; But I'll gang hame to bonnie Polly. I'll tak' nae mair, I'm no that saft, Tho' unco laith to leave guid liquor, The winds may blow as they were daft, And let the snaw be sax-time thicker, And gin I tint the vera best O' barley-bree,— it's aiblins folly,— I'll wrap my plaidie owre my breast, And gang hame, sune, to bonnie Polly. 'Troth, Poll is hamely — wid respect, Quoth Denis, as the Hostess check'd His jeering tone; but by me sowl, It's our own Oirish lovers bowl The worrrld of song from off its legs. Like potheen running out in kegs, And no one axin' them ashore. Jist hear this now, by Ror' O'More! Dermot's Uproar. Och, Norah, me jewel! So keen-eyed and cruel, Yur heart is as hard as a di'mond or purl: Me red and white coral! Ye niver can quarrel Wid Dermot who loves ye, the jew'l of a girl. Like the purl o' the mornin, The daylight adornin, So early uphoister'd from out the salt sea, Like a fresh flowrin sea-weed, 'Ts meself has of thee need: Shure Dermot and Norah were made to agree. Och, Norah, me jewel! You can't be so cruel: Yur heart's like a ruby or tough amethyst. Ye're a rock, I'm a-thinkin, That don't care a winkin How yur purty white throat by the fond waves is kist. Is it waves? I've a notion, Were Dermot the ocean, Or say but a bay batt'rin spray at yur feet, Och, I'd crown ye wid laurel If ye'd make up our quarrel, And whisper — O Say-God! thim kisses are sweet. The Frenchman's turn came next. Pardòn! His hand to ze fair dames he keess, And he vould sing a small chanson He turn himself to Eenglish, Meess! The song, he said, came à-propos, For Meess had tell him that she know French of de Beranger, and he Was proud of taste with hers agree. Belle smiled, but bravely bit her lips. Jean kiss'd again his finger-tips; Then sang, in English beyond quarrel, How Charles the Seventh loved Agnes Sorel. I go combat — thy will, my Own! Adieu, pleasùre! adieu, repose! I will have, to revenge my crown, God and my love and these heròes. Englishmen! may my Lady's name Carry into your ranks terròr! Near her I had forgotten fame: Agnes me renders to honòur. Amidst my games — my idle reign Frenchman and king, from danger far I did my France let to the chain, A captive to the stranger's war. One word my Lady's mous did name My front with redness cover'd o'er. Near her I had forgotten fame: Agnes me render'd to honòur. If Victory my blood must take, Agnes! my blood will all run down. But no! for love and glory's sake Charles will be conqueror of renown. I ought to conquer, in thy name, With thy favòurs and thy colòur. Near her I had forgotten fame: Agnes me renders to honòur. Dunois! La Tremouille! Saintrailles! O Frenchmen! what a day, how sweet, When twenty battles going by Lay laurel crowns at Beauty's feet. Frenchmen! speak gratefully her name Of glory and good-hap donòr! Near her I had forgotten fame: Agnes me renders to honòur One guest, yet undescribed, sat Belle beside: A gentle youth, mustached and tender-eyed, Of nice behaviour, in his Sunday's best. How came he there we will not make iuquest At present. Ere the plausive echoes died, Was it a blush Belle sought to hide That made her turn away? Or something in those youthful eyes That met her own sweet thought, Whereat she started as with shamed surprise? That start the Sister caught, And at her word the gentle youngster brought And sang as a true lover ought A Roundelay. O love! true love, that asks not for return! O love, true love, that asks but leave to love! True love that only lives, and likes, to prove His own sweet wealth, with never need to earn! O love, pure love, still well content to yearn, To stand afar, to pray, yet never move! O most untired desire to give all love For love's dear sake and ask for no return! O love, true love, the loved in vain may spurn! Unheeded love, that in the desert strove! Unchanging, faithful, never-failing love! Be sure some day there shall be fair return! That's in the high-falutin' key, Said Enoch. How in Vairmount we Go courtin', would you keer to know? The words are by Hosee Biglow, Music my own. Yes, Sir! that's so. to query by Sandy. Uncle Zekle came tu woo — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Huldy skeer'd tu buckle tu — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Heer'd him hawkin up the street; Smiled ez apples wern't all sweet; Pucker'd up her mouth tu meet, Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Uncle Zek peep'd thru the glaze — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! She show'd pooty in the blaze — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Peelin apples fast ez sin, Hadn't time tu cry — Come in! He fer parin wuz too thin! Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Uncle's skin wuz crinkled oak — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! And his v'ice a kinder croak — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Wen he dror his cheer and sot Jest too near her she look'd hot: Fire or blushes, which? he tho't. Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Uncle talk'd sum of his hogs — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Huldy heer'd the cracklin logs! Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Uncle kep in Bank, he sed: Huldy wuz too young tu wed: Wintry cold an old man's bed: Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Uncle Zek wuz here tu-night — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Sparkin in the chimbly light — Ha, ha, the wooin o't! Wut does Huldy in the snow? “One more kiss before I go!” Mind if Huldy answer No! — That's our Vairmount wooin o't. By this the punch was like to fail; But Denis cried — A double gale! And echoed all the cry. A shadow o'er the pale Host pass'd, A half-rebuke, his first, his last;— He held his glass on high And, waving it above his head, Sang out, as his heart's blood were shed, Whiskey and liberty! Another bowl before you're gone — Were his last words. And only one! Our Hostess graciously appends: Though seldom such a sheaf of friends (She glanced around upon them all) Comes with such will without a call. And now the final punch was mix'd And every glass refill'd. Then Bull, supremely rising, fix'd His hand upon his heart; And — Ere we must depart, (So spake he) little as I'm skill'd In compliment, you will permit me say — Of our good friend now sitting here before us — Hip, hip, hooray! Was chorus. Who shall count the drinks were had While mad mirth grew more and more as Momus steep'd the moments' noses In the mixture that disposes Even Sorrow to be glad: Softer Sorrow! On the morrow Sick as Pharoah's Court of Moses. Fairer fate my Muse discloses, Lifting of our night the blanket: No wet Banquo at this banquet; King's friends' scullery at the least Brought no death's head to our Feast; Death was not in pot or pottle. Shade of Southey (name is Cottle) Reinspire me, that the end may be Applied to this high theme with fit full dignity! Help, Apollo! for the Hours Are bowling off and, by the Powers, Night's watchman from his misty towers Is hurrying down. Kirke White's the last two lines: I would claim but my own. Thou too, Goddess, fancy free, In heaven clep'd Mnemosynè! Memory, with the slender waist And back-turn'd visage, hither haste! Whether without weight of wage Thou porèst o'er some antique page, Some palimpset whose record Might suffice for thy reward; Whether thy late thoughts explore The prehistoric Cushite shore, Haply looking for some lost Berosian bricabrac; or, tost Back from the sharp Sierras' flanks To muddy Mississipian banks, Thou seekest amid ancient mounds For the earlier river bounds; Or circlest the unwirèd world For forty minutes; or with curl'd And radiant head bow'd to thy knees Dream'st of the far Symplegades: Goddess excellently bright! Thou that makèst day of night! Goddess memorably wise! Help the tale of our Surprise! Benevolent Goddess! plume thy swiftest wing; Attend this fond complaint, and prompt more words to sing. Sandy! you do not drink, said Denis. Dry And sandy's the same thing — was his reply. I'll tak' a mere sup just to moist my mou', Syne croon my verse again. I'm no that fu' But I'll sing brawly, and the sabject's guid, And present Comp'ny! ye'll no ca' me rude For singing out o' turns. I'm like the burns, Aye tuneful. So he hugs Conceit with both arms tightly to his breast, (His glass got leave of rest) And flings ane ither Scotch sang i' their lugs. The ait 's a callant fine and guid To meet i' the mornin' airlie: But gie me for the ingle neuk My gossip — bearded Barley! Kail-brose at noon is weel eneuch, I'll gar it welcome rarely; But ilka hour frae dawn till night For rantin' Bree o' Barley! Is it potheen, scream'd Denis, ye mane? As the song has it, ane o' your ain:— When Pathrick brew'd a power o' malt, And Tim Dahomy cam' to prie, They found the brewin' had one fault: It was not quite enough for three. They were na fu' But yet it's thrue That baith thegither counted three, Whyles each ane saw The ither twa Thru mixins o' the barley-bree. Ye've corrapted the taxt athegither, As ye do wi' our auld bonnie sangs, Meanin' airs. To believe ye the thrang's A' frae Ireland. It's thrue, by the Powers. Then Bull: Why, the most of them's ours. Weel, weel, it's a' made i' the heather: There's little of choice, I'm a-thinking. Only gie me the drinking! Glenlivat or potheen's all one. Bedad, but that's thrue whin all's done. Whereat but they all cried Hear! hear! And Sandy with fresh cheer Loosen'd anither stave. (Holy — Madam! without lave.) I will na ask for silk attire, And siller I can spare, Gin I've a toddy by the fire And on the sideboard mair. For Barley is my darlin,' my darlin,' my darlin'; For Barley is my darlin'— His christen'd name is Beer. Give me our home-brew'd English ales, For breakfast, lunch, or stirrup-cup, And our old English madrigals For music! —May be just a sup O' the brandy poonch? You haven't named your drink. Waal! replied Enoch, Cocktails, not to wink At Cobblers in desult'ry times.— Weel! different drinks suit differing climes. Let ilka poet choose his rhymes! We've nae sae like laws as in France.— The Ladies might prefer a dance, Said Denis, and arose, And tow'rd an Irish jig his toes Accommodating made advance. — But hauding wi' our drappies, Under favour o' the Leddies, Seeing toddy's on the tapis, That's a vile drink, your Bourbon, sae quickly it unsteadies. — Yaas! ze Bourbon is canaille. — Whereon Enoch took a smile, Acting contempt; and Wait awhile Until good Bourbon you've known. Mayn't be good for mixing; take it straight! Then you'll own — But I reckon it's some late. And the Frenchman rose with him: For the dawn a kinder dim Light slid between the blinds. Our Host was playing with the rinds Of lemons; but our Hostess rose serene, Like as the harvest moon is seen, And, standing royal as a Queen, Said — We thank you for your presence here last night — Afforded much delight — King and myself are owing And beholden to your friendship much (The slightest touch Of irony); but King has been A traveler — travel-spent. Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once! We went.</field>
