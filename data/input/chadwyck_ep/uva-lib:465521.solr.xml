      <field name="fulltext">Mecænas optimus, atque Cocceius, missi magnis de rebus uterq; Legati, aversos soliti componere amicos. Hor.: Serm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Earl of Portland, &amp;c. On his Lordships Return from his Embassy in France. My Lord, Mecenas, Mighty in the Arts of Peace, Brought Rest to Rome, and you to Britain Ease. Like his, your Counsels sav'd the Nation's blood, Like his, the Rivals of your Lord Subdu'd. Both made their foes accept the terms they scorn'd, VVent forth for Peace, and Both with Peace return'd. Thus Welcome to your Masters arms you come, Thus Welcome to his Realms, as he to Rome. What man but you, who know the secret Springs Of Princes Councels, and the hearts of Kings, So soon could tame so turbulent a Mind, And calm a Soul as Boistrous as the Wind? Make Lewis, spite of his Ambition, yield, And boasting Victory, forsake the Field, To court the Prince his Envy once abus'd, And sue for Peace, which he before refus'd. You stopt his Glory in its full Career, And made him dread the Prospect of the War. Your Masters Conduct, and his Might declar'd, Which France with Terror and Amazement heard. She thought no more of Universal Sway, Of making Empires yield, and Kings obey; But trembling for the Countries she possest, She gladly gave up part, to save the rest. This who Expected, that had heard her boast, How much their freedom should their Champions Cost? Yet all believ'd her Vast Compliance true, Who knew the Treaty was referr'd to you. With William you were taught th'Important arts, To win the Mild, and quell the Proudest hearts; Bred in his Court, which Fame declar'd afar, The Seat of Wisdom, and the School of War In whom but you could ev'ry State confide, To teach France Justice, and correct her Pride And whom but you, my Lord, could William trust, To make her pleas'd with those that made her Just? You, who before our Monarch fixt his Choice, Had been distinguisht by the Publick Voice, To spread the Nations Glory, and declare, VVe shine in Peace, as we prevail in War. And when among our Rivals you appear'd, They learn'd to love the people whom they fear'd. The Pomp and Presence of your Entry shew'd, Such Hero's were not form'd to be subdu'd. VVith Rapture on the Glorious Train they gaz'd, And scarce were more delighted than amaz'd. So much they Joy to find their dangers cease, You seemd to triumph where you carry'd Peace. And now, methinks, your Chariot I behold, Rich in bright Paintings, and the VVheels in Gold; Eight Africk Steeds that draw the gay Machine, VVith decent Pride resist the Silver Rein. In glitt'ring Chariots next your Friends advance, Next England's youth, and then the Pomp of France. The Heads of Councels, and the Chiefs of VVar, Attend your coming, and its Lustre share. They shew their utmost Gallantry in vain, And look but mean behind so fine a Train; For those whose Honor made 'em Servants there, Like Masters of the Camp and State appear; Mounted on Steeds that neigh against the bit, And deckt with Orange Plumes, comtemn the Gallick white. Nor had our Britains quite forgot the days, VVhich ancient Story speaks with so much praise, When thro the Streets of Gaul their Fathers rode, And our fifth Harry led 'em like a God; When Conquest waited on his Sword, and Death Or Life depended on the Victor's breath; When France of nothing but Obedience spoke, And Swore Eternal homage to our Yoke. This Mighty thought our blooming Hero's warm'd, And their young Courage with bold Prospects Charm'd. This fir'd their Eyes, and made our Rivals fear Another Harry might again come there. But soon their vain and distant terrors cease, For those they fear'd, were those that brought 'em Peace. Forgive the Muses flight, ye Sons of War, Whose Arms have stretcht the Gallick Empire far. So much to our great Ancestors is due, Which we may Pay 'em without wronging you. This little Tribute to their Shades allow, They sleep, alas! and cannot Conquer now. But see! The Grand Procession moves along, And stops th'Impetuous Sallies of my Song. See France, Renown'd throughout the World for Shew, Confesses she's outdone in Splendor now. See, how the Vulgar to their houses cling, Hark, how the streets with Portland's Welcom Ring. Hark, from the Croud repeated shouts rebound, The Steeds Instructed beat the trembling Ground, And ev'ry heart grows Chearful at the sound. They bless the Monarch, whom they once blasphem'd, Their Late unjust and fatal rage Condemn'd. Scarce their own Lewis now is more ador'd, So well the Friend can represent his Lord. Great thoughts of him by you, my Lord, they frame, And on their rude Insults reflect with shame: Abus'd by those who serv'd their cause with Lyes, They see their malice, and our foes despise. A Rout, which at your Presence fled away, As Fogs are scatter'd by the rising Day. They murmur'd horrid Treason, and withdrew, To holes and wilds, to curse their Cause and you. You, by whose Vigilance and Restless Toyl, Our Sov'raign Reigns in Safety o're our Isle. His foes, that were too wicked to be friends, Can only mutter like invet'rate Fiends. Pests of the world, from ev'ry Realm exil'd, They live to want the Peace they would have spoil'd. Like Jews to ev'ry Region they're a curse, But to themselves, and him, they serve a worse. Here let my Muse forbear these Sons of Night, That serve like Shades to give her Picture Light. For now my Fancy is I feel perplext, To draw the shining Scene which follows next. To paint you Led by Princes to Versailles, There to secure our Friendship to the Gauls. And strait before their Master you appear, Who in Sublimest State expects you there. His Sons, the Prop and Safety of his Crown, With their young Queens, stand waiting round the Throne. A Croud of Demi-Gods on either hand, All born to Rule, or destin'd to Command. Their Beauties next in radiant Circles shine, And but our own no forms are more divine. High on his Seat, like Jove, the Monarch sits, Who only when Nassau is nam'd submits. Then moving, with a dreadful grace descends, To meet with Smiles the man that made 'em friends, Swears from this hour the Nations Rage shall cease, And crys with William, Let the World have Peace. Since the blest World, at whose command the Light Broke forth, and Nature loos'd the bonds of Night, Since Peace and Pardon were proclaim'd from Heav'n, No sweeter voice was heard, nor blessing giv'n. VVith Extasie the Royal Audience hear The Kings by you their plighted Friendship swear. Nassau's the subject of their high discourse; His Justice, VVisdom, and his matchless Force, Are all their talk, and ev'ry tongue displays Its utmost Eloquence to speak his praise. Lewis himself at length with pleasure hears Those wonders told which he no longer fears. This awful Scene of Majesty gives way To one, tho not as Stately, yet as Gay. The Heirs of Empire next your Message hear, And in his Fav'rite our Great Lord revere. Their beauteous Princesses your coming wait, And wish your business had been more than state. Their Eyes betray how much their Hearts adore Our Prince, and wish his Friendship something more. So soon Great actions will the Greatest move, And what begets their Wonder kindle Love. This done, the Princes at prodigious cost, Strive who shall honour and divert you most. But Conde's and Chantilly's Charms Invite, To see the Muses, and their Sons delight. Conde, (who early had our Victor seen Make his Sire yield, who ne're would yield till then) Learnt at Seneffe the Hero to esteem, And shews by you his vast respect for him. In those blest Paths by ancient Bourbons trod, Those Groves, the Temple of the Muses God, Which have so oft with Conde's Triumphs rung, By Sarazin and Gallant Voiture sung. Hadst thou, O Prior, try'd thy tuneful Lays, And sung thy Masters, and his Portland's Praise, Thy Lyre as Sounding, and thy Voice as sweet, The Theme sublimer, and thy Art as great, The God had made their names to thine submit, And France been taught Subjection too in Wit.
