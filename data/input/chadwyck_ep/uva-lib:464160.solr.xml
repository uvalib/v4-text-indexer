      <field name="fulltext">To his knowne friende mayster Edward Godfrey Merchaunt. To maister Iohn Harlowe his approoued friende. To the Reader. What age in Infantes is requirde, or ere they should bee taught, What sort of Teachers best agrees, what Schooles bee good, what naught, Dewe meanes also t'instruct them well, all these good Readers here Within this booke (though smal to vewe) in largest wise appeare. With other matters incident, which to my simple skill, For thy delite, I haue discourste and written with good will. My meaning doe accept for good: but pardon thinges amisse. So shall my penne for thy behoofe write greater thinges then this. A Compendious fourme of education, to be diligently obserued of all Parentes and Scholemaisters in the trayning vp of their Children and Schollers in learning. Gathered into Englishe meeter, by Edward Hake. The Speakers. Philopas. Chrisippus. Philopas Chrisippus, in these careles dayes wherin the blinde are bolde To force with wordes the truth of thinges: wherin each man doth hold His owne deuise for reasons rule, his will for perfect lawe, Wherein eache one accountes his words for depthe of learned sawe: What thinkst thou in this case of mine, shoulde Infantes tender yeeres Bee trained vp and taught in booke care wanton Childhood weares, Or staye til time of greater strength, that they then better maye Bee able to sustaine the toyle that learning lookth for aye? And whereby theyr so tender sence more capable maye growe, To bring foorth fruite of better thinges which carefull skill shall sowe? Of truth, it seemthe, twere best that I my litle sonne at home Should keepe a while in childishe race and suffer him to rome, To playe the wanton yet a while vntill such time as hee Through helpe of yeeres may labor beare and more capatious bee. Chrisippus Philopas, I perceaue in you as in eache father nowe: You wishe for fruite of tender soyle and yet forbeare the plowe. At first, at first Philopas, when the minde is voyde of cares, When heape of vice for want of place the witte of wanton spares, While tender age is tractable while minde is apte to take Eache good precept, and it retaine, then then your entraunce make. For olde men nought remember but suche thinges they learnde in youth: If good therefore bee graft in time, good fruite thereof ensuthe. Esteeme for naught the wordes of suche, as holde that infantes age Hath neyther strength to wade with pain ne witte for learning sage. For first of all, thentraunce vn- Memory chiefly regarded to the obtaining of learning. to learning doeth consist In memorye aboue the rest: and all men well it wiste That Children haue the aptest wittes both to retaine and holde. To supple waxe the seale doth sticke, not so to waxe that's olde. And for so muche as nature hath to learning vs begotte, Why should wee thinke y? learnde to sone that nature thinketh not? Why should we deeme the study rashe of that same thing to bee Whereof by Nature seedes are sowne in eache yong Babe we see? Dame Nature in our mindes hath sowne the knowledge of eache thing: Why shoulde wee then make nice those bloomes to better state to bring? Besides al this some thinges there bee though needeful to bee knowne Of elder sort, yet those in Babes more easilye are sowne And soner setled than in such as are of riper time As Christcrosserowe the skill of tongues fine tales and Catoes rime. For briefe, why is that age esteemde for learning so vnfitte Whiche all men see so apte and prone good nourture for to gette? Naye, what wyl children sooner doe which once haue power to chatte When as they see no remedye, than styll to thincke on that? Howe much more profitable ist that that same age shoulde bee Stirde vp with learning than with toyes, so meane haue his degree? For if the Childe haue sense to learne lewde thinges and trifles vaine, Then thinck the same hath sense likewise to learning so againe For as vpon newe white lymde walles Men painte what likes them best (Beet good or ill:) so sure it standes with Infantes tender brest. At first (I saye) eare cares come on, eare vice beginne to growe, Let children learne. Such seedes encrease as men in time shall sowe. Unto the sheepes newe shorne fleese whereon no dye hath fall, You maye such perfect collour cast as likes you best withall. Philopas Alas Chrisippus, small it is (God wotes) that Children can By helpe of tender sence obtaine: and (praye) what bootes it than Therfore the same into theyr heades which they can not retaine? Nowe in good soothe, it seemth to mee but trauaile spent in vaine. Chrisippus Sweete licour may preserued bee as well in brittle glasse As in the pot framde out of stone or vessell made of Brasse. And why should sclender gaine bee lost? to little geue you more: And so shall litle gaine in time increase aboundant store. At least this profite shall ensue to them through studies toyle, Theyr mindes shal haue no place for vice which tender skill doeth foyle. For nothing better occupieth the busye minde of man Then earnest studye wrought with toyle though happing now and than. And sure, this gaine ought not to bee contempnde in any wise: For what though weake the body bee? the witte to strength shall ryse. And then the losse is counteruailde, who would not rather craue. Some losse of strength than losse of witte, if wishing hee might haue? Nayth'lesse it is not ment to make tough Champions of the same: But only for the common weale, good gouernours to frame. Whereto their childish strength wil serue and well suffisaunt be: Far weaker state then Milos strength, will therevnto agree. And yet if daunger ought appeare, through pressing of the minde: Why should not such as haue the charge, some present easement finde? Let nothing stoppe the care of skill, and learning to be hadde: It forceth not for lacke of game, let little childe be sadde. But parents fondely fray their sonnes, Abuse of fonde Parentes. from toyle that study craues: Though vilely they neglect such things, as bring them to their graues. As filthy surfets in their meate, wherethrough to them doe grow Not only in the body hurt, but in the minde also. They bring their infantes vnto feastes of straunge and diuers foode: In banquets that tyll midnight last, their presence doth them good. With salt and fresh they fill their gorge with hote and colde aleeke, Untill the stomacke ouerchargde, through vomite ease doth seeke. They pinche and crooke their bodies in, the little corps they straine With garments far vnmeete such age, and to be thought as vaine. They cocke them vp with coates of pryde they vse them for their squires, They make them Cockneies in their kind and Apes in their attires. Not any wayes more tenderly they doe mistrust their strength, Then when they should be set to schoole, and brought to booke at length. Moreouer parents there be some which when (in tender age) They heare their children likde for ought, they streight their state presage. This child saith one wil proue wel learnd: then sayth the father, sure, I will for him some Prebende or some Prouostship procure. Or else I trust to see him rise to tipe of high degree: To be some Iudge, some man of lawe, or man of dignitie. This childe sayth one will make a man, see how his limmes be pight? The father straight way saith: this childe shall be a courtly knight. Thus thus, to wish in swathing bands before the childe can speake, They thinke it not to soone at all: yet if a man man should breake With them to haue that child brought vp, and traind in learning so, As he with skill might vse such thinges as vnto him might gro, They aunswere that he is to young, though wordes be vtter plaine: Of truth of truth (Philopas) I adiudge these men but vaine. As for the wordes that mothers vse, my childe hath how to liue, He shall (I trust) a liuing get although he neuer giue Himselfe vnto such needelesse toyle and trauell at his booke: I force them not, they are but fonde, good grounde they neuer tooke. But let me see? to aunswere here, (for so I thinke it best) These foolish wordes whereon their fond opinion is increast. Shee sayth hir childe hath how to liue: what, how to lyue right well? Naye, there a strawe. I toulde you I the mother cannot tell. What needeth lawe or logicque ought, (sayth shee) er else such like? My sonne hath landes whereon to liue: hee needth no learning seeke. And hath he so in deede good wife? what, shall he haue such staye? So much the more he learning needth, to shield him from decaye. The larger that the ship is framde, and frayghted vp with wares: So much the more vndoubtedly should be the shipmans cares. Yea, and so much the more it needth, a Steers man hauing skill: Thorow want of whom y? frayghted ship, falth into daunger still. Farre, far, therefore more bountifull is he that learning giues, Then he that yeldeth heapes of coyne whereon the body liues. Which Alexander great declares, if I were not (quoth hee) King Alexander, then I wish, Diogenes to bee. Wherefore, to fine this long discourse, lette infancy be taught: And euen such for whome great wealth hath great preferment wrought. Philopas. Of truth Chrisippus, worthyly you haue dilated this. Now tell me whether priuate schoole or publicke better is. Chrisippus. Philopas to discourse this poynt, what scooles were best to bee: Fewe wordes shal neede the case is cleere: all men may plainely see That many sooner are refor- med by the feare of one, Then one instructed perfitly, by onely one alone. Wherefore I thinke there eyther ought to be no schoole at all. Or else that that same scoole should be a scoole ingenerall. Saue first to tell you by the way, that common scooles require: Such onely as haue gaind their grounds, and greater things desire. For why, where sundry sortes of wits, are linckt in scooles degree, There generall teaching must be vsde, wherewith all though we see Some speciall wittes to profit well and gather skill thereby, Yet common sorte cannot therewith the sondry poyntes espie. But as the mayster holdeth on, as needes he must his course, So doth the scholler still sticke fast and growe from ill to worse. Philopas. Declare this one thing more I pray. if greater profit growe Through many teachers to a childe, or greater else through fewe. Chrisippus As parents ought most carefully herein to make their choyse: And as they ought most earnestly to heare the common voyce, And knowe report of him whome they doe choose t'instruct their childe: Euen so (no lesse) their heede shoulde be, (least hope be soone beguilde) That many teachers they refuse: for (as the prouerbe is) The country Caria was destroyd in such a case as this. So many men, so many wittes, younge infantes are dismayde When that the thing they learne to daye to morrow are vnlayde. To seeke for reasons in this case, no reason vrgeth so: Suffiseth me to haue that proofe that practizde parents know. Yet one thing needely must I ope: Tradendi ratio. the onely meane to teache, How neyther rough nor weery way should tender mindes appeache, For why, at first this infants age with flattery shoulde be traynd, Bycause it hath not skill to knowe what proffite may be gaynd. What honor, fruite, what dignity, what pleasure in the ende May happe to such as haue delyght to learnings lore to bende. Which both the maysters gentlenesse, and eake the schollers witte, For both their partes, may bring to passe, and driue the paine from it. For nothing is more profitlesse, nought looseth labour more, Than whan the maysters cruell trade doth feare the childe before. And make him hate or ere he know wherefore it should be looude. So loue to booke which should be first, through feare is first remooude. The first degree to lerning is, the scoole mayster to loue: Whereby it comes to passe in time, as skilfull teachers proue, That little childe which loued first his booke for maysters sake: In time through loue to learning doth, like loue to mayster take. For as those giftes are loued most, which come from those we loue: So babes that know not why to loue. for maysters cause doe loue. Isocrates hath rightly sayd, that he doth learne most, That hath the most desire to learne, and thinkes no labour lost. And as to learne, we learne best of those we best doe loue: So loue to mayster is the cause, that loue to booke doth moue. For parents euen themselues cannot preuaile if they shall vse To breake them all by feare and force and gentle meanes refuse. Much lesse the maister may through feare through foule and froward meane, Once worke a will vnto the booke, but soone vndoe it cleane. The chiefe regarde is to be looud, then feately doth succeede, No feare, but frindely reuerence, which (to define indeede) Hath greater charge then cause of feare, hath care to shielde fro shame: Hath doubt to drag and drawe behind, not feare to suffer blame. How yll therefore doe they foresee, the safetie of their childe. The bewtifying of his braines with skill and maners milde That tourne him in his tender age, to gastly mazing scoole: Where thronizd sits a mayster straunge blunt, rude, and halfe a foole. Oftetimes infected with disease, inueterate and olde: Which makes the waywarde testie foole with little lambes to skolde. And surely, we doe see there can be none so abiect fooles So base and voyde of sence, but now, men vse them for their schooles. And thinke them meete to bring vp youth, to traine them at their bookes: Where expert men at first doe iudge them Asses by their lookes. And they supposing to haue got a kingdome in their kinde, Aduaunce themselues with fearful lookes and set aloft their minde: Bycause they beare a rule, but not in beastes (as Terence sayth) But in that age which soone (god knowth) a little terrour frayth. A man woulde saye it were no schoole but slaughter house in deede, Whence sauing stripes and roaring out, no learning doth proceede. What else is this than soone to fraye, the silly babes from booke, who wanting pleasaunt flattering words none other pleasure tooke? And some a man shall sooner kill then mende with cruell blowes, Where he by fayre and quiet meanes might bring to learning those. But this lewde kinde of men (for truth) ought not to heare the name Of maysters, but of manquellors, so brutish are the same. And none more fell and frowarde are, than those which nothing haue Wherewith tinstruct and teache a childe: whose doggishe deedes depraue The due successe of forwarde wittes: whose roughnesse doth deface The golden sparkes of natures giftes which in the childe hath place. A gentle Horse is sooner rulde with sticke or litle wande Then with a whippe or digging spurre within the side to stande. The Oxe likewise beeing to much prickt, doeth soone caste of his yoke, And bringes to daunger him that driues, through hap of heauie stroake. So men must handle forward wittes as Lyons do their whelpes: The huige and heauie Elephant the skilfull person helps. What should I saye? no beaste there is, no sauage beaste in fine, Whom violence will not prouoke, and skill to will incline. But some perhappes will here alledge theise scriptures for their turne: VVho spares the rodde, doth hate the childe, and vvho in love doth burne, Eccless. 30 Doth vse the same vnto the vvhippe: againe bovve dovvne in youth His necke, and knocke him on the side eare greater age accruthe. And this correction might perhaps, agree vnto the Iewes: But christians to translate these wordes, far otherwise doe vse. That, if some one woulde binde vs now vnto the letter bare: What more absurdly can be sayd? what wordes worse sounding are, Than thus to bowe a downe the necke of little children, and To knocke and thumpe them on the sides with sticke or with the hande? What, thinkst thou y? we breake an Oxe to frame him to the plowe? Thinkst thou we teache an asse to beare? or else that we seeke howe The tender sence of silly babes to bende to vertuous lore? Whose slender handes with fearefull sute Our fauour doth deplore. Nay, let our roddes that we shall vse, be admonitions mylde: And if we chide, as chyde we must, see bitternesse exilde. This whippe, this whippe accustome wee our children still vnto: That they being wel brought vp &amp; taught, may learne what best to do. Maye finde at home an honest forme of life, and neuer neede To hange vpon our neyghbours sleeue for counsell and for reede. Lycon, that olde Philosopher, doth teache and well declare How that to cheere vp childrens wits, two spurres most sharpe there are. The first is prayse, the seconde shame, with which two spurs must wee Toule on our children if we looke, that learned they should be. And now, if that you seeke to know what thumps we ought to vse: How we should knock our childrens sides take these, the rest refuse. Lets watchfull be ti'instruct them well, no labour let vs spare, To teache and traine them vp to good, Let that be all our care. Some times to reade, and of things redde againe for to require A iust account: loe these be thumpes that tender wittes desire. First lette them learne to loue, &amp; haue in admiration great, Good letters and an honest lyfe. Againe, with ardent heate Fowle ignoraunce and filthy life to hate with single eye: The one to loue and still to seeke, the other to defie. And let their eares be tyckled vp to beare some one for good Tenioy great prayse, and other some of whome is vnderstood Some lewde offence, to haue reproche and still enduring shame: So teache them still dame vertues prayse and vices fowle defame. This man (say thou) through learning skil is come to high degree: This man to welth by learning, this to power and dignity. But this againe, through yll desert through wante of learnings lore, Reproche, contempt, and pouerty hath gaind himselfe therefore. These truely be the very battes, these be the thumpes in deede, That scollers of sweete Iesu Christ, will take to them at neede. Philopas. Chrisippus I doe well allow, eche worde that you haue sayd: And sure I thinke that gentle wittes through terrour are dismayde. And yet to saye that ragged coltes, that rude vnruely boyes Wil be reclaimd through shame or praise No no, they count them toyes. That sauour not of smarting whippes, which yet perhappes in some, So neuer worckes, that they thereby prayse to goodnesse sooner come. Muche lesse through fawning flattering for some much lesse doe waye The losse of prayse, naye losse of skill, than any losse of playe. Chrisippus To such Philopas, vnto suche, whome neyther milde request Nor rough rebuke, nor prayse nor shame to learning will inuest, The smarting rodde (if neede so be) must now and then be hadde But so, as we doe coldely fight, and not as we were madde. Yea, bashefully we shoulde lay bare their bodies when we fight: For nakednesse to gentle boyes if many are in sight, A kinde of great reproche doth seeme. and Fabius doth deny That body of a gentle boy in nakednesse should lye. But some perhaps will say to me, what shall be done with those Whome we to study cannot frame, except it be with blowes? To suche I aunswere in this wise: what would you seeme to doe To asses or to Oxen, if they come the schoole into? What? would you not soone driue them foorth into the country soyle, The one to'th milne, the other with the plowe and cart to toyle? And certainely, no lesse are men vnto the plowstaffe borne, Than is the Oxe: no lesse to'th milne, than th' Asse with laboure worne. Philopas. But so the maysters flocke decayes, and therewithall his gaine. Chrisippus Aha, there goeth the Hare away: by this appeareth plaine, That vnto such, farre dearer is the fare of filthy meede, Then is the care how they should make their schollers good in deede. But such no doubt, the common sorte of Scholemaysters are now: And yet as wise Philosophers, doe flatly teache vs how A wiseman we should well discerne, as Rhetoriciens eke, An Orator doth well discribe, when as they say: go seeke And scarcely finde whome thou mayst call a rightwise man in deede, Whome thou mayst call an Orator, (thereto belongth such heede:) So much, and farre more harde it is that we should well attone What he the mayster ought to be, as who should say such one As scarcely may be founde the lyke: such one as hardely will The due prescribed forme accorde or can the same fulfill. But such should be the publique charge of ciuill magistrates And of the Ecclesiasticall: yea, of the high estates, That as the Souldiour trayned is, and fitted for the fielde, As singing men are taught to tune the counteruerse they yelde: So, much more should they see that man be taught, much more be traynde That to the worthy teaching trade hath any way attaynde. Vespatian from his coffers gaue a certaine yearely see To lerned men: that learning so might well maintayned bee. And Plinius Nepos did the like. But if the publique care Should happe to cease, then euery man at home must needes prepare To haue a priuate teacher. But thou sayst, how then should they That are not able so to doe, their children any way Bring vp to learning? wherevnto I nothing haue to saye But this that Terence doth recorde: when as we cannot doe Euen as we woulde, then as we maye. we shewe the trade vnto Right teaching, as not able we good fortune for to giue, Except we wish the welthies ayde to such as poorely liue. Now to retourne, I doe mislyke that mildenesse should expell That feare and reuerence which a child becommeth very well. But these who nothing else doe know saue fiercely how to fight, How would they doe if they should teache Kinges children whome they might Not iercke nor strike withouten blame? But haplie twill be sayde That children borne of noble race More neerely must be wayde. And is thy sonne or mine in fayth lesse man then any they? Is not eache fathers childe thinkst thou as deere to him, and gaye, As if the same a Kinges sonne were? If fortune be but base, Then learning and good bringing vp must helpe releeue his case. Contrariwise if welthy porte doe happen to his lotte, Then wisdome helpth to guide his welth, and shielde his name from blotte. And though we haue not welth by birth though so not honors glee Nor office, nor renowme, yet sure thereto brought vp we be. And here I leaue to brawle and chyde, with cruell maysters: here I wholy ende that poynt: so as this one thing may appere: Namely, that lawes and magistrates condemned are to be Which euer seeke with paine to pinche, and neuer doe agree T'allure with pleasures and reward: which ponish still but so, As they ne warne the fault whereby the ponishment doth growe. Right so I thinke of that same sort, that common sort I say, Of schoolemaysters which onely seeke their silly boyes to paye, To beate and bounse them for their faults and not t'instruct their minde So as they may both see and know from what offence to winde. Wherein I ende remembring this, that in eche excercise Our mindes delight is chiefest cause that we to skill arise. Lo, here Philopas, you haue hearde, what qualities are meete For him that shall instruct a childe againe, what thinges vnfeete, Are wisely to be lookde vnto, and in the same foreseene: Whereby you may auoyde such faultes, as heretofore haue beene Neglected in that kinde of men. the scoolemayster you see, To winne the childe, should seeme a child and childe againe shoulde be. And yet I wholy doe mislyke that that same crooked age Wherein the second childhood dwelth, should take the roome of sage Instructors: for such men in truth are children euery deale: They faine not childehoode but in truth they childehoode doe reueale. They doe not seeme to stamber, but they stamber plaine in deede. I wish such men to be displast and youngmen to succeede. And howe this young man now shoulde deale what forme the same should vse, What meanes to teach he shoulde retaine and what againe refuse, This resteth here to be discust: and as the proofe doth finde, None otherwise the same should deale in forming of the minde, Then skilfull Nourse or parents deale when they the body frame: Which that he may so imitate, Lo here insueth the same. To teache the Babe to speake, they first doe tattle foorth their wordes: And lispingly they frame their tongue to that the babe afordes. Dad dad for father first they giue, and beade they teache for breade: And when they teach him drinke to aske, then din to him is sayde. And pretily they lispe their wordes Whereto it prates againe: And thus at length as proofe doth teache the Baby speaketh playne. To teache it how to eate, they put the pappe within their lippes And from the spoone oftsoones they seeme to drawe foorth prettie sippes. Which done therwith they feede the babe. And when they teache to go, They bende their corpse, and frame their pase before their infants so. As what therwith, and with such meanes as they with pulpits vse, In time the childe hath perfite pase, he can none other chuse. And this thing worthy noting is, their childe they neuer feede With all that comes to hande, but they obserue with carefull heede Both what to giue and howe to giue: what quantity to vse: And eke to feede it laysurely: for if they should infuse And poure it in with retchlesse handes, they know they eyther should Their baby choke, or at the least, his cloathes woulde be fould. Now therefore, as of lightest meates and meates agreeing best, They oft and little giue them, so the infants tender brest In teaching should be framed like: your selfe (Philopas) may Thexample best apply, for I haue something else to say. You looke (I know) that I shoulde teach what things do best pertayne To childrens wittes: what first to learne which onelye doth remaine At this time to be handeled here. this brieflie therefore knowe, That loue vnto the lattine tongue in childehood first should growe, With vse thereof, which easily without great studies care To children comes: but hardely when the same more aged are. Whereto (as hath bene sayde before) the fables doe inuite With morall sawes in couert tales: whereto agreeeth rite Fine Comedies with pleasure sawst, which (as it were by play) Doe teache vnto Philosophie a perfit ready way, Then sentences and prouerbs choyse and Apothemes of men, Wherin greate wisedome restes, wherin great learning aye hath bene. Which fables and which comedies they better farre shall learne, If once they know the arguments, and summe thereof discerne. The names of Trees, of plants also and names of monsters straunge, With natures of them finely taught, doth cause their mindes to raunge, To seeke abroade for farther sight with longing mindes to know Where this beast lives, where that birde breedes where this straunge tree doth grow. In fine, it helpeth very much the lattin tongue t'attaine, T'associate such with whome good skill in lattine doth remaine. Auoyding still as rockes and clyffes. foule barbarous wordes to name No latin rather lette them speake than so to speake the same. And here concluding, this I note, that in the first degree Of teaching, this aboue the rest must well aduerted bee. That, whatsoeuer pleasaunt is, what thing so euer eake Is easie to be vnderstoode, that children best doe lyke. For surely as it is absurde to looke for grapes in spring, In haruest else to looke for Rose or such like blooming thing: So schoolemaysters must well adapt such thinges as they shall teache, Unto their childes capacity: so as the same may reache And it conceyue, with firme delight: for pleasure profites much, And nothing else but pleasure may allure to learning such: So as na'thlesse we carefull be to auoyde all bawdie rimes And wanton iestes of Poets vayne that teache them flithye crimes. Good stories from the Bible chargde and from some ciuil style, As Quintus Curtius, and such like to reade them otherwhile. Where through by iust degree of skill from reading shall succeede As eke of congrue vse of speach a seemely forme indeede Of writing well: which naythelesse is difficile: but so, As by the maysters skill the same may farre more easie grow. Rewardes he must prescribe for such as shall performe their charge: But such as neyther mylde request, nor prayse nor promise large Can bring to better forme of skill, with those, this practise he Must put in vre: that is to weete though they vnlearned be, To make them thinke and yet beleeue themselues to be of might T'encounter with the better sorte, and put the same to flight. And euermore we must auoyd t'enioyne them thinges to harde, Or things not needefull to be taught or things that may be sparde. For (Lorde) how are their mindes perplext how troubled will they be When thinges they cannot vnderstande, through much obscurity? But though that something of it selfe some hardenesse doth containe, Yet may the maysters policie make easie that againe. For like as good phisitions that doe bitter potions make, With somthing sweete doe smeere the pot that infauntes so may take The Potion that they would haue drunke whereby they are alurde The same to drinke, which else to doe, they coulde not be procurde: Euen so the skilfull mayster ought to deale in eche respect: Thinges difficult with ease to teach and leysure to direct. And yet we may not too too much mistrust our childrens strength: For what they cannot learne at first, that learne they at length. Though strength they haue not as an Oxe yet as an Ant they haue: And oft vnto the Elephant the little Flye doth scath. Conceypt doth chiefly hurt a childe, where if you make but play Of things that you shall teach him, then Conceipt doth neuer fraye. That one and onely scruple nowe remaines to be discust, Which many one full fondely doe against all reason thrust. They say the profite is so small, that children doe obtaine Before the same be fiue yeres olde, that labour is in vayne, And cost ill spent that is bestowde to bring them vp to booke. But these men which will this obiect. these rather seeme to looke More straightly to the parents purse, and more to spare the paine Of maisters, then to well respect their little childrens gaine. But graunt the profite be but small admit it small in deede: Take rather small than nothing yet, for thats the wisemans reede, And slender howsoeare it be that that same age shall gaine, Yet this aduauntage be you sure shall thereunto remaine: That greater thinges they shall atchiue that yere, wherein if they The smaller things had erst not learnd they on the same shoulde stay. I neede not here repeate againe that certaine thinges we see In infantes age farre better learnde than when they greater bee. And graunt we that they trifling are and things of slender skill. Yet they such tryfles first atcheeue that greater thinges fulfill. The painfull Crafts man makes account euen of the smallest coyne, For why in time, to that same small, he greater store doth ioyne. The Goldesmithes rise ere breake of day, before they well can see, To winne some time beforehand still, (though nere so small it be) The Plowman sometimes doth not stick on dayes that holye seeme To binde his sheaues, to shocke and oft to set a worke his Teeme. And shall we way for nothing then the losse of fiue yeres time? Shall we so hange on harder age, that we neglect the prime? When as thers nothing halfe so riche as time, nor halfe so good As learning is: oh nothing may so high be vnderstood. Here here Philopas, here should men most neerely pinch and spare: Euen here (I saye) for losse of time, shoulde be their chiefest care. The husbandeman hath good regarde that no part of his grounde Doe lye vntilde: for looke what peece vnfit for grayne is founde, That he with Osiers sets and plants, Or else to pasture layes: And one way or another still he fruite thereof doth rayse Shall we permit the best part then of all our time to flytte Without all learnings profite had? without increase of witte? New fallowd grounde must needes be sowne with some one kinde of seede, Or else (euen of it owne accorde) it brings forth noisome weede. Like so the tender Infants minde, except the same be taught With good precepts, it will bring foorth the thing that's meerely nought. The minde doth eyther good things yeelde, if good therein be sowne, Or if thou nothing sow therein, with vice tis ouergrowne. And surely he not smally gaynes, that vice can well eschewe: And he that shuts foorth vice doth not to vertue least accrewe. What? wilt thou know how much it helps tinstruct a childe betime? Why, then behold thou Ouid well: marcke Lucan in his prime. Vrsinus but eleuen yeres olde, so wonderfull was founde, That straunge it is to make report, how farre he did abounde Great Alexander in his youth, euen all the partes attainde Of wisedome and Philosophie: and with the same had gaynde Such perfite forme of eloquence, that had not kingdomes pryde Withdrawne his mind from studies care no man could haue denyde But that amongst Philosophers (the chiefest of them then) Not seconde but the very chiefe accounted he had bene. But here to fine this long discourse, your selfe Philopas I Will haue to witnesse all such thinges as earst haue passed by. Epilogus. Consider well what portion and what deere possession eeke A sonne is: and how flittingly mans minde doth knowledge seeke. How wayghtie education is, what hablenesse is founde In tender childes capacity: what quicknesse doth abounde. How easily the same doth learne, how Nature giues consent: And how they profite most when they to learned men are sent, And vnto such as gentle are, which teach them all by play: Thinges easie first, and harder things when harder thinges they may. To these things adde how deere and of what waight our time should be: How much it helps to teache betimes, what fruite thereof we see. Hesiodus doth flytting call the wandring age of man: Whose youth is busy, and whose age is quite from learning gon. These thinges if thou shalt well obserue, sixe yeres, shall not be seene Nor yet three yeres before thy sonne which heretofore hath beene Neglected (as to this intent) shall eyther learning gaine. Or else be well preparde at least, good learning to obtayne. FINIS.</field>
