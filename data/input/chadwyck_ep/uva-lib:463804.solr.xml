[PASSUS I.] In a somere seyson whan softe was þe sonne, Y shop [me] in-to shrobbis as y [a] shepherde were, In Abit as an Ermite vnholy of werkes, Ich wente forth in þe worlde wonders to hure, And sawe meny cellis and selcouthe þynges. Ac on a may morwenyng on Maluerne hulles Me byfel for to slepe for weyrynesse of wandryng; And in a launde as ich lay lenede ich and slepte, And Merueylously me mette as ich may ?ow telle; Al þe welþe of þis worlde &amp; þe woo boþe, Wynkyng as it were wyterly ich saw hyt, Of tryuþe &amp; of tricherye of tresoun and of gyle, Al ich saw slepynge as ich shal ?ow telle. Esteward ich byhulde after þe sonne, And sawe a toure, as ich trowede truthe was þer-ynne; Westwarde ich waitede in a whyle after, And sawe a deep dale deþ, as ich lyuede, Wonede in þo wones and wyckede spiritus. A fair feld, ful of folke fonde ich þer bytwyne, Alle manere of men þe mene &amp; þe ryche, Worchynge and wandrynge as þe worlde askeþ. Somme putte hem to plow and pleiden ful seylde, In settyng and in sowyng swonken ful harde, And wonne þat þuse wasters with glotenye destroyeþ. Somme putte hem to pruyde &amp; parailede hem þer-after, In contenaunce &amp; in cloþynge in Meny kynne gyse; In praiers &amp; in penaunces putten hem Manye, Al for þe loue of oure lorde [lyueden] ful harde, In hope to haue a gode ende &amp; heuene-ryche Blysse; As ancres &amp; Eremites þat holden hem in hure cellys, Coueytynge no?t in contrees to carien a-boute For no lykerouse lyflode hure lykame to plese. And somme chosen cheffare þey [cheuede] þe betere, As hit semeþ to oure syght þat soche men þryueþ. And somme murthes to make as mynstrals conneþ, Þat wollen neyþer swynke ne swete bote swery grete oþes, And fynde vp foule fantesyes and foles hem maken, And hauen witte at wylle to worche yf þey wolde. Þat Paul prechiþ of hem prouen hit ich myghte, Qui turpiloquium loquitur ys lucyfers knaue. Bydders and Beggers faste a-boute ?oden, Tyl hure bagge and hure bely were bretful ycrammyd, Faytynge for hure fode and fouhten atten Ale. In glotenye, [god wot] goth þey to bedde, And aryseþ with ribaudrie tho Roberdes knaues; Slep &amp; synful sleuthe seweþ suche euere. Pylgrimis &amp; palmers ply?hten hem to-gederes, To seche seint Iame and seyntys of rome, Wenten forth in hure way with meny vn-wyse tale[s], And hauen leue to lye al hure lyf-tyme. Eremytes on an hep with hokede staues, Wenten to walsyngham and hure wenches after; Grete lobies and longe [þat] loth were to swynke, Cloþede hem in copis to be knowe fro oþere, And made hem-selue Eremytes hure eise to haue. Ich fond þer frerus alle þe foure ordres, Prechynge þe peple for profit of þe wombe, And glosynge þe godspel as hem good lykede; For couetise of copes contrariede som doctors. Meny of þis maistres of mendinant freres, Hure monye &amp; marchaundise marchen to-gederes; Ac sutth charite hath be chapman and chef to shryue lordes, Many ferlies han fallen in a fewe ?eres; Bote holy churche &amp; charite choppe a-doun swich shryuers, Þe moste myschif [on] molde Mounteþ vp faste. Ther preched a pardoner as he a prest were, And brou?te forþ a bulle with bisshopis seles, And seide þat hym-selue my?te asoilie hem alle Of falsnesse of fastinges of vowes to-broke. Lewede men lyuede hym wel and likeden hus wordes, Comen &amp; kneleden to kyssen his bulles; He blessede hem with hus [breuet] and blerede hure eye[n], And raghte with hus rageman rynges and Broches. Thus ?e ?eueþ ?oure golde glotones to helpe, And leneþ it to loreles þat lecherie haunten. Were þe bisshop blessid oþer worth boþe hus eren, Hus sele sholde no?t be sent in deceit of þe puple. Ac it ys no?t by þe bysshop þat þe boye precheþ, Þe parsheprest and þe pardoner parten þe seluer, Þat poore puple in parshes sholde haue, yf þei ne were. Persones &amp; parsheprestes pleynede to þe bisshop, Þat hure parshen[s] ben poore sitthe þe pestelence tyme, To haue licence &amp; leue in londone to dwelle, And synge þer for symonye [for] seluer ys swete. Bisshopes and bachilers boþe maisters and doctors, Þat han cure vnder cryst and crownynge in tokne, Ben chargid with holy churche charyte to tulie, Þat is, leel loue and lif a-mong lered and lewed; Thei lyen in londone in lentene, and elles. Somme seruen þe kynge and hus seluer tellen, In þe chekkere and þe chauncelrie chalengynge hus dettes, Of wardes &amp; of wardemotes wayues and strayues. Somme aren as seneschals and seruen oþere lordes, And ben in stede of stywardes and sitten &amp; demen. Concience cam &amp; acusede hem and þe comune hit herde, And seide, “ydolatrie ?e soffren in sondrye places menye, And boxes ben [broght] forþ [I-]bounden with yre, To vnder-take þe tol of vntrewe sacrifice. In menynge of miracles muche wex [þer hangeþ]; Al þe world wot wel hit my?te nat be trywe: Ac for it profitiþ ?ow to porswarde ?e prelates soffren Þat lewede men in mysbylyue leuen &amp; deien. Ich lyue wel, by oure lorde for loue of ?oure couetyse, Þat al þe world be þe wors; as holy wryt telleþ What cheste, &amp; meschaunce to [þe] children of israel, Ful on hem þat free were þorwe two false preestes. For þe synne of ophni and of finéés hus brother, Þei were disconfit in bataille and lostenArcha dei; And, for hure syre sauh hem syngen and soffrede hem don ille, And no?t chasted hem þer-of and wolde no?t rebukie hem, A-non, as it was ytold hym þat þe children of israel Weren disconfit in bataille and Archa dei ylore, And hus sones slayen anon he ful for sorwe Fro hus chaire þare he sat and brak hus necke a-tweyne. And al was for veniaunce þat he but no?t hus children; And for þey were preestes and men of holychurche, God was wel þe wroþer and tok þe raþere veniaunce. For-þi ich se?e, ?e preestes and men of holychurche, Þat soffren men do sacrifice and worshepen Maumettes, And ?e sholde be here fadres and techen hem betere, God shal take veniaunce [on] Alle swiche preestes Wel harder and grettere on suche shrewede faderes, Þan euere he dude on ophni and finéés, or [on] here fader, For ?oure shrewede suffraunce and ?oure owene synne. ?oure masse &amp; ?oure matynes and meny of ?oure houres Aren don vndeuotlich drede ys at þe laste Leste crist in hus constorie of ?ow a-corse menye. Ich parceuede of þe power þat peter hadde to kepe, To bynden and vnbynden as þe boke telleþ, How he [hit lefte] with loue as oure lorde wolde, Amonges foure vertues most vertuose of vertues, That cardinales ben callid and closynde ?ates, Ther crist is in kyngdome to closye with heuene. Ac of þe cardinales at court þat [cau?t] han such a name, And power presumen in hem-self a pope to make, To haue þe power þat peter hadde repugnen ich nelle; For in loue and in letterure lith þe grete eleccion; Countrepleide it no?t,” quath Conscience “for holy churches sake.” Þanne cam þer a kyng kny?t-hod hym ladde, The muche my?te of þe men made hym to regne; And þanne cam kynde witte &amp; clerkus he made, And conscience &amp; kynde wit and kny?t-hod to-gederes Caste þat þe comune sholde hure comunes fynde. Kyndewit &amp; þe comune contreuede alle craftes, And for most [profit] to þe puple a plouh þei gonne make, With leel labour to lyue whyl [lif] and londe lasteth. Than kynde wit to þe kyng and to þe comune seide, “Crist kep þe, [sire] kyng and þy kynryche, And [leue] þe lede so þy londe þat leaute þe louye, And for þy ry?tful ruelyng be rewardid in heuene.” Conscience to cleregie and to þe kyng saide, “Sum rex, sum princeps [neutrum] fortasse deinceps; O qui iura regis christi specialia regis, Hoc vt agas melius iustus, &amp; esto pius! Nudum ius a te vestiri vult pietate, Qualia vis metere talia grana sere; Si seritur pietas de pietate metas.” Conscience and þe kyng in-to þe court wenten, Where houede an hondred in houes of silke, Seriauntes hij semede þat seruen atte barre, To plede for penyes and poundes þe lawe, And nat for [loue of oure lord] vnlose hure lyppe[s] ones. Þow my?t bet mete þe myst on maluerne hulles, Þan gete a mom of hure mouth til moneye be hem shewid. Thanne ran þer a route of ratones, as it were, And smale mys with hem mo þan a þousand, Come to on counsail for hure comune profit; For a cat of a court cam whan hym lykyde, And ouer-leep hem ly?tlyche and lauhte hem at wille, And pleide with hem periloslich &amp; putte hem þer hym lykyde:— “And if we grucche of hys game he wol greue ous sarrer, To hus clees clawen ows and in hys cloches holde, Þat ous loþeth þe lyf er he lete ows passe. My?te we with eny wyt hus wil with-sette, We my?te be lordes aloft and lyue as vs luste.” Tho saide a raton of renoun most resonable of tonge, “Ich haue yseie grete syres in Cytees and in tounes Bere by?es of bry?t gold al aboute hure neckes, And colers of crafty werke boþe kny?tes and squiers. Were þer a belle on hure by?e by iesus, [as] me þynkeþ, Men my?te wite wher þei wenten and hure wey roume.

A loueliche lady of lere in lynnen y-cloþid, Cam doun fro þat castel and calde me by name, And seide, “wille, slepest þow syxt þow þis puple, How busy þai ben a-boute þe mase? The most partie of þe puple þat passeþ on þis erthe, Haue thei worship in þis worlde þei willen no betere; Of oþer heuene þan here þei holden no tale.” Ich was aferd of hure face thauh hue faire were, And saide, “mercy, ma dame what may þys be to mene?” “The tour vp-on toft,” quaþ hue “treuthe ys þer-ynne, And wolde þat ?e wrouhte as hus word techeþ.

He ys lettare of loue and lyeth alle tymes; Þat tryst in erthely tresour he by-traieþ sonnest, To en-combrye men with couetyse that is hus kynde.” Thanne hadde ich wonder in my wit what womman hue were, Þat suche wyse wordes of holy wryt shewede; And [halsede] hure on þe heie name er hue þennys wente, What hue were witterly þat wissede me so and tauhte. “Holychurche ich am,” quaþ hue “þow oghtest me [to] knawe; Ich vnder-feng þe formest and fre man þe made.

Hit is as derworthe a druwery as dere god him-selue. For he, is trewe of hus tonge and of hus two handes, And doþ þe werkes þerwith and wilneþ no man ille, He is a god by þe gospel and graunty may hele, And like oure lorde also by seynt lukys wordes. Clerkus þat knowen þys shoulde kennen hit a-boute, For cristene and vncristene cleymen it echone. Kynges and kny?tes shoulde kepen hit by reson, Ryden and rappe a-doune In reames a-boute, And take trespassours and tyen hem faste, Til trewþe hadde ytermenyd here trespas to þe ende; And holde with hym and with hure þat han trewe accion, And for no [lordene] loue leue þe trewe partye. Trewely to take and treweliche to fy?te, Ys þe profession and þe [pure] ordre þat apendeþ to kny?tes; Who-so passeþ that poynt ys apostata of kny?t-hod.

Ne were it for norþerne men a-non ich wolde telle; Ac ich wolle lacke no lyf” quaþ þat lady sothly; “Hit is sykerer by southe þer þe sonne regneth þan in þe north by meny notes no man [leue] oþer. For þider as þe fend flegh hus fote for to sette, Ther he failede and ful and hus felawes alle; And helle is þer he ys and he þer ybounde.

Alle þat worchen þat wikkede ys wenden þei shulle After hure deþ-day and dwelle þer wrong ys; And alle þat han wel y-wroght wenden þey shulle Estwarde to heuene euere to abyde, Ther treuthe is, þe trone þat trinite ynne sitteþ. Lere it þus lewede men for lettrede hit knoweþ, [Than] treuthe &amp; trewe loue ys no tresour bettere.” “Ich haue no kynde knowyng,” quaþ ich “?e mote kenne me bettere, By what wey hit wexith and [wheder] out of my menyng.” “Thow dotede daffe,” quaþ hue “dulle aren þy wittes, Ich leue þow lernedist to lyte latyn in þy ?owthe; Heu michi, quod sterilem duxi uitam iuuenilem! Hit is a kynde knowyng þat kenneþ in þyn herte For to louye þy lord leuest of alle, And deye raþere þan to do eny dedlich synne; Melius est mori quam male uiuere. And þis ich trowe be treuthe who so can teche þe betere, Loke þow soffrie hym to say and so þow myght lerne. For treuthe telleþ þat loue ys tryacle for synne, And most souereyne salue for saule and for body. Loue is þe plonte of pees and most preciouse of vertues; For heuene holde hit ne my?te so heuy hit semede, Til hit hadde on erthe ?oten hym-selue. Was neuere lef vp-on lynde lyghter þer-after, As whanne hit hadde of þe [folde] flesch and blod ytake; Tho was it portatyf and pershaunt as þe poynt of a nelde, May non Armure hit lette noþer hye walles; For-þy is loue ledere of oure lordes folke in heuene, And [a] mene, as þe meyere is by-twyne þe kyng &amp; þe comune, Ry?t so is loue a ledere and þe lawe shapeþ; Vp man for hus mysdedes þe mercement he taxeþ. And for to knowe it kyndeliche hit comseþ by myghte, In þe herte, þer is þe hefd and þe hye welle. Of kynde knowyng in herte þer comseþ a myghte, That falleþ to þe Fader þat formede ous alle. On ous he lokyde with loue and let hus sone deye, Meekliche for oure mysdedes to amendy ous alle. And ?ut wolde he hem no wo þat wroght hym al þat tene, Bote myldeliche with mouthe mercy he by-souhte, To haue pyte on þat puple þat paynede hym to deþe. Her my?t þow see ensample In hym-self one, That he was myghtful &amp; meke and mercy gan graunte, To hem þat henge hym hye and hus herte þerlede. For-þy ich rede ?ow ryche haue reuthe of þe poure; Þauh ?e be myghty to mote beeþ meke in ?oure workes; Þe same mesure þat ?e meteþ amys oþer ellys, ?e shulleþ be weyen þer-with whanne ?e wenden hennes; Eadem mensura qua mensi fueritis, remecietur uobis. Thauh ?e be trewe of ?oure tonge and trewelich wynne, And be as chast as a chyld þat noþer chit ne fyghteþ, Bote yf [?e] loue leelliche and lene þe poure, Of such good as god sent goodliche parte, ?e haue no more meryt in masse ne in houres, Than malkyn of hure maidenhod wham no man desireþ. For Iamys þe gentel [Iuggeþ] in hus bokes, Þat feith with-oute fet ys febelere þan nouht, And ded as a dore-nayle bote yf þe dede folwe; Fides sine operibus mortua est. Chastite with-oute charite worth cheynid in helle; Hit is as lewede as a lampe þat no lyght ys ynne. Meny chapelayns aren chast ac charite hem faileþ; Aren none hardur ne hongryour þan men of holy churche, Auerouse &amp; euel-willed whanne thei ben auaunsed, And vnkynde to hure kyn and to alle crystine; Thei chewen here charite and chiden after more; And encombred with couetyse þei conne nat out crepe, So harde hath aueryce hasped hem to-gederes. And þat ys no treuthe of þe trinite bote trecherie and synne, And luþer ensample, leue me to þe lewede puple. For thees aren wordes wryten in þe euangelye, Date et dabitur uobis [for I dele ?ow alle.] And þat is þe lok of loue þat vnloseþ grace, Þat conforteth alle cristine encombred with synne. So loue ys lech of lyue and lysse of alle peyne, And þe graffe of grace and grayþest [wey] to heuene. For-þy ich may say, as ich seide by syght of þe tixt, Whenne alle tresours ben tryed treuth ys þe best; Loue it,” quaþ [þat] lady “lette may ich no lengere To lere þe what loue ys” and leue at [me] hue lauhte. Explicit passus secundus. PASSUS III. Incipit passus tercius. And þanne ich knelede on my knees and cryede to hure of grace, And seide, “mercy, madame for marye loue of heuene, Þat bar þat blessede barn þat boughte vs on þe rode, Kenne me by som craft to knowe þe false.” “Loke vpon þy lyft half,” quath hue “lo whar he standiþ, Boþe fals and fauel and fykel-tonge lyere, And menye of hure maners boþe men and wommen.” Ich lokid on my lyft half as þe lady me tauhte, And sauh a womman as yt were wonderlich riche cloþed. [Hue] was purfild with peloure non purere in erthe, And coroned [with] a corone þe kynge hath no betere; On alle hure fyue fyngres rycheliche yrynged, And þer-on rede rubies and oþer riche stones. Hure robe was ryccher þan ich rede couthe, For to telle of hure atyre no tyme haue ich nouth. Hure a-raye with hure rychesse rauesshede myn herte, “Whas wyf hue were and what was hure name, Leue lady,” quaþ ich þo “layn nat yf ?e knowen.” “Þat ys mede þe mayde,” quaþ hue “þat hath noyed me ofte, And lowen vp-on my lemman þat leaute ys hoten, And lackyd hym to lordes þat lawes han to kepe, In kynges court &amp; in comune court contrarieþ my techynge. In þe popes paleys hue is pryuy as my-selue, Ac soþnesse wold no?t so for hue is a bastarde; On fauel was hure fader þat hath a fykel tonge, And selde soth seith bote [if] he souche gyle; And mede ys manered after hym as men of kynde karpen, [Qualis] pater, talis filius. For shal neuere brere bere beries as a vyne, Ne on croked kene þorne kynde fygys wexe; Bona arbor bonum fructum facit. Ich ouhte be herre þan hue ich kam of [a] betere, The fader þat me forth brouhte filius dei he hoteþ, Þat neuere lyede ne lauhwede in Al hus lyf-tyme. Ich am hus dere douheter duchesse of heuene; What man þat me louyeþ and my wille folweþ, Shal haue grace to good ynow and a good ende; And what man þat loueþ mede my lyf ich dar wedde, He shal lese for hure loue a lappe of trewe charite. That most helpeþ men to heuene mede most letteþ, Ich do hit vpon dauid þe doumbe wol no?t lye; Domine, quis habitabit in tabernaculo tuo, et cetera. Dauid vn-doþ hit hym-self as þe doumbe sheweþ, Et super innocentem munera non accepit. To-morwe worth mede wedded to a mansed wrecche, To on fals faithles of þe feendes kynne. Fauel þorgh his flateryng speche hath mede foule enchantid, And al is lyers ledyng þat lady is þus ywedded.

Lacke hem no?t, bote lete hem worthe tyl leaute be Iustice, And haue power for to punyshe hem þen put forþ þy reson. For ich by-kenne þe crist,” quaþ hue “and hus clene moder, Encombre neuere þy conscience for couetyse of mede.” Thus left me þat lady lyggynge a slepe. And ich sauh how mede was maried metyng as it were; And al þe riche retynaunce þat roteþ hem on fals lyuynge Were bede to þat brudale on boþe half þe contreie, Of many maner men þat were of medes kunne; Of kny?tes, of clerkes of oþer comune puple, As sysours and somners shereyues and here clerkes, Budels and bailifs and brokours of chaffare, [Forgoers] and vytailers and vokettus of [þe] Arches, Ich kan no?t rekenye þe route þat ran a-boute mede. Ac symonye and ciuile and sisours of contreis Were most pryuye with mede of eny men, [meþou?te]. Ac fauel was þe ferste þat fette hure [out] of chambre, And as a brocour broghte hure forth to be ioynid with fals. Whanne symonye and cyuyle sauh here boþeres wil, Thay assented þer-to at seluers praiere. Thenne leep liere forþ, and seide “lo! here a chartre, That gyle hath gyue to falsnesse and graunted to mede,” And preyþ cyuyle it to see and symonye it to rede. Þanne symonye and cyuyle stoden forth boþe, And vnfeelde [þe] feffement þat fals hadde maked; Þanne sayde symonye þat cyuyl it herde, “Alle þat louen &amp; byleuen vp lykyng of mede, Leueþ hit leelly thys worth hure laste mede, Þat folwen falsnesse fauel, and lyere, And me, and swiche men þat after mede wayten. Sciant presentes et futuri: et cetera. [Witen] alle and witnesen þat wonen here on erthe, Þat mede ys y-maried more for hure richesse Þan for holynesse oþer hendenesse oþer for hye kynde.

The erldom of enuye and yre he hym graunteþ, With þe castel of cheste and chatering-out-of-reson; The countee of couetise he consenteþ to boþe, With vserye and Auerice and oþer false sleithes In bargeyns and in brocages with þe borghe of þufþe, And al þe lordshep of lecherye in lengþe and in Brede, As in workes and in wordes [and] waitynges of eyes, In wedes and [in] wisshynges and with ydel þouhtes, Þer þat wil wolde and werkmanshup faileþ. Glotenye he geueþ hem and grete oþes to-gederes, Al day to drynke at dyuerse tauernes, Ther to Iangle and to Iape and Iuge her emcristine, And fastingdayes to frete by-for noon, and drynke With spicerie, spek ydelnesse In veen speche, and spene, And suwye forþ swych felaushep tyl þei ben fallen in slewþe, And a-wake with wanhope and no wil to amende, For he leyueþ be ylost when he hus lyf leteþ: This lif to folwie falsnesse and folk þat on hym leueþ, After hure deþ [a] dwelling day with-outen ende In luciferes lordshup as þys lettere sheweþ, With al þe portinaunce of purgatorye And þe payne of helle.” In witnesse of þis þyng wrong was þe ferste, And Peres þe pardoner of paulynes queste, Bette þe budele of banneburies sokne, Reynald þe reue and Redyngkynges menye, Munde þe mylnere and meny mo oþere. In þe date of þe deuel þis dede ys a-seled, By syght of syre symonye and cyuyles leue. Thanne [tened] hym theologye whenne he þys tale herde, And seyde to syre symonye “now sorwe mote þow haue, Such a weddyng to worche þat wrathe myghte treuþe. And er þis weddyng be wroughte wo to al ?oure consail! For mede is moillere amendes was here dame; Þouh fals were hure fader and fykel-tonge hure syre, Amendes was hure [moder] by trewe [mennes] lokyng. With-oute hure moder amendes mede may noght be wedded, For treuth plyghte hure treuthe to wedde on of hure douhteres, And god grauntede it were so so þat no gyle were, And þow hast ygeue hure as gyle taughte god ?yue þe sorwe! For cyuyl and þy selue selde fulfilleth Þat god wolde were ydo with-oute som deceite.

And mede ys moillere a maiden of goode, Hue myghte cusse þe kyng as for hus kynswomman. For-þy worcheþ by wisdome and by witte al-so, And ledeþ hure to londoun wher lawe may declare, Yf matrimoine may be of mede and of falshede. And þow Iustice[s] en-ioynen hem þorgh Iurers oþes, ?ut be war of þe weddyng for wytty is treuthe, And conscience is of hus consail and knoweth ?ow alle; And yf he fynde ?ow in defaute [and] with þe false holde, Hit shal sitte ?oure soules ful soure at þe laste.” Her-to a-sentyd cyuyle ac symonie ne wolde, Tyl he hadde seluer for þe seel [and] sygnes of notaries. Tho fette fauel forþ floreynes y-nowe, And bad gyle “go gyue gold al a-boute, Nameliche, to notaries þat non of hem faille; And feffe falsnesse with floreynes ynowe, For he may mede amaistren with hus myry speche.” Tho þis gold was gyuen gret was þe þonkynge That fals and fauel hadde for here faire ?yftes, And comen ful courteislich to conforte þe false.

Thanne lourede leches and letters þei senten, Þat lyer shold wony with hem waters to loke. Spicers to [hym] speke to aspie here ware, For he can on here crafte and knoweþ meny gommes.

Ac Freres þorw fayre speche fetten hym þennes; For knowynge of comers þei copyde hym as a Frere; Ac he hath leue to lepen out as ofte as hym lykeþ, And ys welcome whanne he comeþ and woneþ with hem ofte. Symonye and cyuyle senten to rome, And putte hem þorw a-peles in þe popes grace. Ac conscience to þe kyng a-cusede hem boþe, And seide, “syre kyng, by cryst bote clerkus amende, Thi kyngdom þorw here couetyse wol out of kynde wende, And holy churche þorw hem worth harmed for euere.” Alle fledden for fere and flowen in-to hernes; Saue mede [þe] mayde no mo dorste a-byde.

Now is mede þe mayde and no mo of hem alle Þorw bedeles and bailifs brouht by-fore þe kynge. The kyng kallid a clerk ich can nouht hys name, To take mede [þe] mayde and make here at ese; “Ich shal asaye hure my-self and sothliche apose, What man of þys worlde þat hure is leuest haue? And yf hue wirche wisliche by wys [mennes] counsail, Ich wolle for-gyue hure alle hure gultes so me god helpe!” Cortesliche þe clerk þenne as þe kynge hyghte, Toke mede by þe myddel and myldeliche here broughte In-to boure with blysse and by hure gan sitte. Ther was myrthe [and] mynstralcy mede to plesen; That wenden to westmynstre worshupde hure meny. Gentelich with ioye Iustices somme Buskede hem to þe boure ther þis berde dwellyd, Confortynge hure as þei couthe by þe clerkus leue, And seyde, “morne nat, mede [ne] make þow no sorwe; For we wolle wisse þe kyng and þy wey shape For to wende at þy wil wher þe luf lykeþ, For alle consciences cast [and] craft, as ich trowe!” Mildeliche mede þo merciede hem alle Of hure grete goudnesse and gaf hem echone Coupes of clene gold and coppes of seluer, Rynges with rubies and oþer riche ?iftes, The leste [man] of here meyne a moton of golde. Whenne thei had lauht here leue at þys lady mede, Thenne comen clerkus to comfortye hure samen, And beden here be blythe “for we ben þyn owne, For to worche þy wil þe while we mowe dure.” And mede hendiliche by-hyht hem þe same, To louen hem leellich and lordes hem make, “And porchace ?ow prouendres while ?oure pans lasteþ, And bigge ?ow benefices pluralite to haue, And in constorie atte court do calle ?oure names. Shal no lewednesse lette þe clerk þat ich louye, Þat he ne worth ferst auanced for ich am [biknowe], Ther connynge clerkus shulleþ clocke by-hynde.” Thenne com þer a confessour coped as a Frere, To mede þat mayde myldelich he sayde, “Thauh lered men and lewede had layen by þe boþe, And falshede yfounden þe al þis fourty wynter, Ich shal a-soily þe my-selue for a seem [of] whete, And ?ut be þy bedman and brynge a-doun conscience A-mong kynges and kny?tes and clerkus, if þe lyke.” Thenne mede for hure mysdedes to þis [man] knelyd, Shrof hure of here synnes shameles, y leyue, Told hym a tale and took hym a noble For to be hure bedman and bere wel hure erende, Among kny?tes and clerkus conscience to turne. And he [as]soiled hure sone and setthen he seide, “We haue a wyndow a worchyng wol stonden ous ful hye; Wolde ?e glase þe gable and graue þer ?oure name, In masse and in matyns for mede we shulleþ synge Solenliche and sothlich as for a sustre of oure ordre.” Louelich þat lady lauhynge seyde, “Ich shal be ?oure frende, frere and faille ?ow neuere, The while ?e louyeþ þuse lordes þat lecherye haunten, And lackieþ no?t þuse ladies þat louyeþ þe same. Hit is bote frelete of flesch ?e fynden wel in bokis, And a cours of kynde wher-of we comen alle. Ho may a-scapie þe sclaundere þe scaþe may sone be mendyd, Hit ys synne as of seuene non soner relesed. Haue mercy,” quath mede “on men þat hit haunten, And [ich] shal keuery ?oure [kirke] and ?oure cloistre maken, Boþe wyndowes and wowes ich wolle a-menden &amp; glase, And do peynten and portreyn who paide for þe makynge, Þat euery seg shal see, and seye ich am sustre of ?oure ordre.” Ac god to alle good folke suche grauynge defendeþ, To wryten in wyndowes of eny wel-dedes, Leste prude be peyntid þere and pompe of þe worlde. For god knoweþ þy conscience and þy kynde wille, Thi cost and here couetyse and who þe catel ouhte. For þy leue lordes loue leueþ suche wrytinges; God in þe gospel such grauynge no?t a-loweþ, Nesciat sinistra quid faciat dextera. Let nat þy lyft half oure lord techeþ, Ywite what þow delest with þy ryht syde. ?ut mede myldeliche þe meyre [hue] bysouhte— Bothe shereues and seriauns and suche as kepeþ lawes To punyshen on pillories and on pynyng-stoles, As bakers and brewers bouchers and Cokes— (For þese men doþ most harme to þe mene puple, Richen þorw regratrye and rentes hem byggen With þat þe poure puple sholde putten in hure womben; For toke þey on triweliche they tymbrid nat so heye, Noþer bouhten hem burgages be ?e ful certayn: Thei haue no [pite] of þe puple þat parcel-mele mote biggen; Þauh þei take hem vntydy þyng þei hold hit no treson, And þauh þei fulle nat ful þat for lawe [is seled], He gripeþ þer-for as grete as for þe grete treuthe.

The kynge fram consail cam and callyd after mede, And sente for to see hure ac ich say nat hym þat ladde hure. Corteisliche þe kyng tho as hus kynde wolde, Lackede here a litel wyht for þat hue louede gyle, And wilnede to be wedded with-oute hys leue, Tyl treuth hadde tolde hure a tokne fram hymselue; And seyde, “womman, vnwittylich wrou?t hast þow ofte; Ich haue for-gyue þe meny gultes and my grace graunted Boþe to þe and to þyne in hope þow sholdest a-mende; And ay þe lenger ich lete þe go þe lasse treuthe ys with þe; For worsse wrouhtest þow neuere þan þo þow fals toke. ?ut ich for-gyue þe þis gult godes for-bode eny more Þow [tene me and] treuthe; and þow mowe be y-take, In þe castel of corf ich shal do þe close Ther as an ancre oþer in a wel wors wone, And marre þe with myschef by seint marye my lady, Þat alle wommen wantowen shulleþ be war by þe one, And biterliche banne þe and alle þat bereþ þy name, And teche þe louye treuthe and take consail of reson.

Conscience knelynge to þe kyng loutede, To wite what hus wil were and what he do sholde. “Wolt thow wedde þis maide yf ich wol assente, For hue ys fayne of þy felaushep and for to be þy make?” Quath conscience to þe kynge “Crist it me for-bede! Er ich wedde suche a wif wo me by-tyde! For hue ys freel of hure faith and fikel of hure speche, And makeþ men mys-do meny score tymes. In trist of hure tresour hue teneþ ful menye; Wyues and wodewes wantownesse hue techeþ, And lereþ hem to lecherie þat louyeþ here ?yftes. ?oure fader hue felde fals and hue to-gederes; Hue haþ a-poisoned popes hue apeireþ holy churche; Ys nauht a betere baude by hym þat me made!

Sysours and somners suche men hure preyseþ, Shereues of shires were shent yf hue ne were. For hue doþ men lese here londe and here lyf boþe; Hue leteþ passe prisoners and paieþ for hem ofte, And geueþ þe gailer gold and grotes to-gederes, To vnfetery þe false and fle where hem lykeþ; And takeþ trewe by þe top and tieþ hem faste, And hongeþ [him] for haterede þat harmede neuere. To be corsed in constorye hue counteþ nauht a rusche; Hue copeþ þe comissarie and coteþ hus clerkus, Hue is assoilid þus sone as hure [self] lykeþ. Hue may ney as moche do in a mounthe one As ?oure secret seel in sexscore dayes. Hue ys priuy with þe pope prouisours it knoweþ, For symonye and hure-self seeleþ hure bulles. Hue blesseþ þese byshopys þauh þei be negh lewede, Hue prouendreþ persons and prestes hue menteyneþ To holde lemmanes and lotebyes al here lif-dayes, And bryngeþ forþ barnes a-?ens for-boden lawes; Sunt infelices quia matres sunt meretrices. Ther hue ys wel wyth eny kynge wo ys þe reome, For hue ys fauerable to fals that defouleþ treuthe. By iesus, with hure iewels þe Iustices hue shendeþ; Hue lyth a-?en þe lawe and letteþ hym þe gate, Þat faith may nat haue hus forþ hure floreines goth so thycke; And ledeþ þe lawe as hure lust And louedayes makeþ, Þoruh which loueday ys lost þat leaute my?te wynne, The mase for [a] mene man þauh he mote euere. The lawe ys so lordlich and loth to maken ende, With-oute presentes oþer pans hue pleseth ful fewe.

Ther nys cite vnder sonne ne so riche reome Ther hue ys loued and lete by þat last shal eny while, With-oute werre oþer wo oþer wicked lawes, And customes [of] couetyse [þe] comune to distruye.

For mede hath knyt clerkes and couetyse to-geders, Þat al þe wit of þis worlde ys woxen in-to gyle. Thus þis lady ledeþ [þy] londe now lord ?eue hure sorwe! For pore men der nat pleyne ne here pleinte shewe, Suche a maister ys mede a-mong men of goode.” Thanne mornede mede menyng hure to þe kynge, To haue space to speke spede yf hue myghte. The kyng graunted hure grace with a good wyll; “Excuse [þe] yf þow canst ich can no more seggen; For conscience acuseþ the to congie þe for euere.” “Nay, lord,” quaþ þat lady “leyueþ hym þe werse, When ?e wyten witerliche in wham þe wrong lyggeþ. Ther [þat] myschief ys gret mede may helpen. And þat knoweþ conscience ich cam no?t to chiden, Ne to depraúe [þi] persone with a prout herte. Wel þow wost wyterly bote yf þow wolle gabbe, Thow hast hanged on myn hals elleuen tymes, And al-so grypen of my gold and gaf it where þe lykede. Why þow wratthest [þe] now wonder me þynkeþ, ?ut ich may, as ich myghte menske þe with ?yftes, And menteyny þy manhod more þan þow knowest. Ac þow hast famede me foule by-fore þe kynge here; For culde ich neuere no kyng ne consailed so to done; Ac ich saued my-self and sexty þousand lyues, Boþe her and elles wher in alle kynne londes. Ac þow þy-self sothliche ho [so] it segge dorste, Hast arwed meny hardy men that hadden wil to fyghte, To brennen and to bruten to bete a-doun strengthes. In þe contreis þer þe kyng cam conscience hym lette, Þat he ne felde nat hus foes þo fortune it wolde, And as hus werdes were ordeined by wil of oure lorde. Caytiflyche þow, conscience consailedist þe kyng leten In hus enemys honde hys heritage of fraunce. Vnconnyng ys þat conscience a kyngdome to sulle, Þat ys conqueryd þorw comune helpe; a kyngdome oþer duche May nat be sold soþly so meny here part asken Of folk þat fauht þer-fore and folwed þe kynges wil. Þe lest lad þat longeþ to hym be þe lond wonnen, Lokeþ after lordshep oþer oþere large mede, Wher-by he may as a man for euere-more lyue after. And þat ys þe kynde of a kyng þat conquereþ of hys enemyes, To helpe heyeliche al hus host oþere elles to graunte Al þat hus men mowen wynne to do þer-myd here beste. For-þy ich counsayle no kyng eny counsayle aske At conscience, yf he coueyteþ to conquery a reome. For sholde neuere conscience be my constable, Were ich a kyng ycoroned by marye,” quaþ mede, “Ne be mareschal of my men þer ich moste fyghte. Ac hadde ich, mede, be hus mareschal ouer hus men in fraunce, Ich dorst haue leid my lyue and no lasse wedde, He had be lord of þat londe in lengthe and in brede, And al-so kyng of þat cuth hus kyn to haue holpen, The leste brol of hus blod a barones pere. Vnkyndely þow, conscience consailedest hym þennes, To lete so hus lordshup for a lytel moneye. Hyt by-comeþ for a kyng þat shal kepe a reame, To ?eue men mede þat meklyche hym serueþ, To alienes, to alle men to honoury hem with ?yftes; Mede makeþ hym [be] by-loued and for a man yholde. Emperours and erles and alle manere lordes Þoruh ?iftes hauen ?emen to rennen and to ryde. Þe pope and alle prelates presentes vnder-fongen, And ?euen mede to men to menteynye here lawes. Seriauntes for here seruice mede þey asken, And taken mede of here maistres as þei mow a-corde. Beggers and bedmen crauen mede for here prayers. Mynstrals for here mynstralcye a mede þei asken. Maistres þat techen clerkes crauen hure for mede. Prestes þat prechen and þe puple techen Asken mede and masse-pans and here mete boþe. Alle kyne crafty men crauen mede for here aprentys, Marchaundise and mede mote nedes go to-gederes. Is no lede þat leueþ þat he ne loueþ mede, And glad for to grype hure gret lord oþer poure.” Thou quath þe kyng to conscience “by Cryst, at my knowynge, Mede ys worthy, me þynkeþ þe maistrye to haue.” “Nay,” quaþ conscience [to þe kyng] “clerkes wyten þe soþe, Þat mede ys euermore a meyntenour of gyle, As þe sauter sheweþ by suche as ?euen mede, Þat vnlawfulliche [lyuen] hauen large honden, To ?eue mede to men more oþer lasse. Ac þer ys mede [and] mercede and boþe men demen A desert for som doynge derne oþer elles. Mede meny tymes men ?euen by-for þe doynge; And þat ys noþer reson ne ryht ne no reame lawe Þat eny man mede toke bote he it myghte deserue, And for to vndertake to trauely for anoþer, And wot neuere witterly wher he lyue so longe, Ne haue hap to hus hele mede to deseruen. Ich halde hym ouer-hardy oþer elles nouht trewe, Þat pre manibus ys payed oþer elles paye askeþ. Harlotes and hores and al-so fals leches, Thei asken hure huyre er þey hit haue deserued. And gylours gyuen by-fore and goode men at þe ende, When þe dede ys ydo and þe day yendyd. And þat ys no mede bote a mercede, A maner dewe dette for þe doynge; And bote if yt be payed prestliche the payer is to blame, As by þe bok, þat bit no body to with-holde Þe hure of hus hewe ouer eue til a morwe: Non morabitur opus mercenarij [tui] apud te usque mane. And þer is reson as a reue rewarding treuthe, And boþe þe lord and þe laborer ben leelliche yserued. The mede þat meny prest[es] takeþ for masses þat þei syngen, Amen, amen, Matheu seyth mercedem suam recipiunt. In marchaundise ys no mede ich may it wel avowe; Hit is a permutacion a-pertelich o pene-worth for anoþer. And þauh þe kyng of hys cortesye kaiser, oþer pope, ?eue lond oþer lordshup [or] oþer large ?iftes, To here leelle [and] lyge loue ys þe cause. And yf þe leelle and þe lyge be luther men after, Boþe kyng and kayser and þe coroned pope May desauowe þat þey dude and douwe þer-with oþer, And a-non by-nymen hym hit and neuere [more] after Noþer þei ne here Ayres hardy to cleyme, That kyng oþer cayser hym gaf catel oþer rente. For god gaf to salamon grace vp-on erthe, Rychesse and reson whyle he ryht lyuede, And as sone as god seih he suwed nouht hus wille, He reuede hym of hys richesse and of hus ryht mynde, And soffrede hym lyue in mysbyleue ich leyue he be in helle; So þat god geueþ no þyng þat synne ne ys þe glose. And so ryght sothliche may kyng and pope Boþe gyue and grauntye þer hus grace likeþ, And eft haue hit a-?eyn of hem þat don ille. Thus ys mede [and] mercede as two manere relacions, Rect and indyrect rennynge bothe On a sad and a syker semblable to hym-selue— [As] adiectif and substantyf vnite asken, Acordaunce in kynde in cas and in numbre, And ayþer ys oþeres help— of hem comeþ retribucion, Þat ys þe ?ifte þat god ?yueþ to alle leelle lyuynge, Grace of good ende and gret ioye after; Retribuere dignare, domine deus, omnibus [nobis], et cetera.” Quaþ þe kynge to conscience “knowen ich wolde What is relacion rect and indyrect after, And þanne adiectyf and substantif for englisch was it neuere.” “Relacion rect,” quath conscience “ys a recorde of treuthe, Quia antelate rei est recordatiuum, Folwyng and fyndyng out þe foundement of strenthe, And styuelyche stonde forth to strengthe of þe foundement, In kynde and in case and in cours of noumbre; As [a] leel laborer þat by-leuyþ with hus maistre In hus paye and in hys pyte and in hus pure treuthe, To paye hym yf he performeþ and haue pyte yf he faylleþ, And take hym for hus trauaile al þat treuthe wolde. So of hol herte comeþ hope and hardy relacion Sekeþ and suweþ hus [substantif] sauacion, That ys [god], þe grounde of al a graciouse antecedent. And man ys relatif rect yf he be ryht trewe; He a-cordeþ with crist in kynde uerbum caro factum est; In case, credere in ecclesia In holy [kirke] to byleyue; In numbre, rotie and aryse and remyssion to haue, Of oure sory synnes asoiled and clansed, And lyue, as oure crede ous kenneþ with crist withouten ende. Thus is relacion rect ryht as adiectif and substantif A-cordeþ in alle kyndes with his antecedent. Indirect þyng ys as ho so coueited Alle kynne kynde to knowe and to folwe, With-oute [case] to cacche [to] and come to boþe numbres; In which beþ good and nat good and graunte here noþers wil. Þat is [no?t] reisonable ne rect to refusy my syres sorname, Sitth y, his sone and seruaunt suwe for his ryghte. For who so wol haue to wyue my worldliche daughter, Ich wol feffe hym with hure fayre and with hure foule taylende. So indirect þyng ys Inliche to coueyte To a-corde in alle kyndes and in alle kynne numbre, With-oute cost and care in alle kynne trauaile, [With-oute resoun to rewarde nau?t recching of þe peple]. Ac relacion rect is a ryhtful custome, As, a kyng to cleyme þe comune at his wille To folwe hym, to fynde hym and fecche at hem hus consail, That here loue þus to [him] þorw al þe londe a-corde. So comune cleymeþ of a kyng thre kynne þynges, Lawe, loue, and leaute and hym lord antecedent, Boþe here hefd and here kyng haldyng with no partie, Bote stande as a stake þat stykeþ in a muyre By-twyne two londes for a trewe marke. Ac þe moste partie of þe puple pure indirect semeþ, For þei wilnen and wolde as best were for hem-selue, Thauh þe kyng and þe comune al þe cost hadde. Al reson reproueþ such imparfit puple, And halt hem vnstedefast for hem lackeþ case. [As] relatifs indirect reccheþ þei neuere Of þe cours of þe case so þey cacche suluer, Be þe pecunie y-payed þauh parties chide. He þat mede may lacche makeþ litel tale, Nyme he a numbre of nobles oþer of shullenges; How þat clyentes a-corde mede a-counteþ lytel. Ac adiectif and substantif ys as ich er tolde, Þat ys, vnyte, acordaunce in case, gendre, and numbre; And ys [to] mene in oure mouth more ne mynne, Bote þat alle manere men wommen, and children, Sholde conformye to on kynde on holy [kirke] to by-leyue, And coueite þe case when þei couthe vnderstonde, To [sike] fore hure synnes and suffre harde penaunce, For þat ilke lordes loue þat for oure loue deyde, And coueited oure kynde and be cald in oure name, Deus homo, And nymen hym into oure numbre now and euere more; Qui in caritate manet in deo manet, et deus in eo. Thus is man and mankynde in manere of a substantif, As hic &amp; hec homo [askyng] an adiectif Of þre trewe termysons trinitas unus deus; Nominatiuo, pater &amp; filius &amp; spiritus sanctus. Ac ho so rat of regum rede me may of mede, Hou hue absolon to hongynge brouhte; And sitthe, for saul sauede a kyng for mede A-geyn godes comaundement god toke suche veniaunce, Þat saul for þat synne and hus sone deyde, And gaf þe kyngdome to hus knaue þat kept sheep and lambren: [As] men [rat] in regum after [Ruth], of kynges, Hou god sente to saul by samuel þe prophete, Þat agag of amalek and al hus lyge puple Sholde deye delfulliche for dedes of here eldren. ‘Saul,’ quath samuel ‘god hym-self hoteþ To be boxome at my bidding hus bone to fulfylle. Haste þe with al þyn ost to þe lond of amalek, And al þat lyueþ in þat londe oure lord wol þat þow slee hit, [Man, woman, and wif child, widowe, and bestes]; Mebles and vnmebles man and alle þynges, Bren hit, ber nouht away be hit neuere so riche, For eny mede of moneye al þat þow myght spille; Spar hit nat and þow shalt spede þe betere.’ And for he coueited hyre catel and þe kyng spared, For-bar hym and hus beste bestes as þe byble witnesseþ, Oþerwise þan god wolde by warnyng of þe prophete, God seide to samuel þat saul sholde deye, And al hus for þat synne and shendfulliche ende. Thus was kyng saul ouercome for couetyse of mede, That god hatid hym for euere and alle hus ayres after. The culorum of þis cas kepe ich nat to shewe, An aunter hit nuyede me non ende wol ich make. For so ys þe worlde went with [hem] þat han þe power, That he þat seith most sothest sonnest ys y-blamed. Ich conscience knowe þis for kynde witt me tauhte, Þat reson shal regne and reames gouerne, And ryht as agag hadde happen shulleþ somme. Samuel shal sle hym and saul shal be blamed, And dauid shal be diademyd and daunten alle oure enemyes, And on cristene kyng kepen ows echone. Shal no mede [be maister] neuere more after, Ac loue and louhnesse and leaute to-gederes Shullen be maistres on molde trewe men to helpe; And ho so takeþ a?en treuthe oþer transuerseþ a?ens reson, Leaute shal do hym lawe and no lif elles. Shal no seriaunte for þat seruyse were a selk houe, Ne pelour in hus paueylon for pledyng at þe barre. Muchel yuel is þorw mede meny tyme suffred, And letteþ þe lawe þorw here large ?yftes. Ac kynde loue shal come ?ut and conscience to-gederes, And make of lawe a laborer suche loue shal aryse, And such pees among þe puple and a parfyt treuthe, Þat Iewes shal wene in here witt and wexe so glade, That here kyng be ycome fro þe court of heuene, Moyses oþer messias þat men be so trewe. For alle þat bereþ baselardes bryght swerde, oþer launce, Axe, oþer acchett oþer eny kynne wepne, Shal be demed to þe deþ bote yf he do hit smythie In-to sykel oþer into sithe to shar oþer to culter; Conflabunt gladios suos in uomeres, &amp; lanceas suas in falces; Ech man to pleye with a plouh a pycoyse oþer a spade, Spynnen, and spek of god and spille no tyme: Prestes and persons placebo and dirige, Here sauter and here seuene psalmis for alle synful preyen.

Then waryn wysman and wyly-man his felawe Fayn were to folwen hem and fast ryden after, To take red at reson þat recorde sholde By-fore þe kyng and conscience yf þei couthen pleyne On wily-man and wittiman and waryn wrynge-lawe. Ac conscience knew hem wel and carped to reson: “Here comeþ,” quaþ conscience “þat couetyse seruen; Ryd forth, syre reson and recche nat of here tales, For þer wratthe and wranglyng ys ther þei wolle a-byde; Ac þer loue and leaute ys hit lykeþ nat here hertes: Contricio &amp; infelicitas in uiis eorum, &amp; uiam pacis non cognouerunt; non est timor dei ante oculos eorum.

Corteslich þe kyng þen cam and grette reson, And by-twene hym[self] and his sone sette þo syre reson, And speken þo wise wordes a long while to-gederes. Thenne cam pees in-to parlement and putte vp a bylle, How þat wrong wilffullich hadde hus wif for-leyen, And how he rauyschede rose þe riche wydewe, by nyghte, And margarete of here maidenhod as he mette hure late. “Boþe my [gees] and my grys and my gras he takeþ, Ich dar nouht for his felaweshepe in faith,” pees seide, “Bere sikerlich eny seluer to seint gyles doune; He waiteþ ful wel whanne ich [seluer] take, What wey ich wende wel ?erne he aspieþ, To robbe me and to ryfle me yf ich ryde softe. ?ut he is bold for to borwe and baddelich he payeþ; He borwede of me bayarde and browte hym [hom] neuere, Ne no ferþyng þer-fore for nouht ich couthe plede.

Tho was wrong a-fered wysdome he by-souhte; On men of lawe wrong lokede and largelich hem profrede, And for to haue of here help handy-dandy payede. “Had ich loue of þe lorde litel wolde ich recche Of pees and of hus power thauh he pleynede euere!” Thoruh wrong and hus werkes þer was mede yknowe, For wysdome and wit þo wenten to-gederes, And toke mede myd hem Mercy to wynne. ?ut pees putte forth hus hefd and hus panne blody, “With-oute gult, god wot gat ich þys scaþe; Conscience knoweþ hit wel and alle þe trewe comune.” Ac wyles and wit weren a-boute faste To ouercome þe kynge þorw catel, yf þei myghte. Þe kyng swor þo by crist and by his corone bothe, That wrong for hus workus sholde wo þolie, And comaundede a constable to caste wrong in yrenes, Ther he ne sholde in seuen ?ere see fet ne hondes. “God wot,” quaþ a wis on “þat were nat þe beste; Yf he may amendes do let meynpryse hym haue, And be borw of hys bale and byggen hym bote, And a-mende þat ys mys-do and euere-more þe betere.” Wit a-corded her-with and witnessede þe same; “Betere ys þat bote bale a-doun brynge, Than bale be [y]bete and bote neuere þe betere.” Thanne gan mede meken here and mercy by-souhte, And profrede pees a present al of pure golde; “Haue þis, man, of me,” quaþ hue “to amende þy scaþe; For ich wol wage for wrong he wol do so no more.” Pytouslich pees þo preyede þe kyng To haue mercy on þat man þat meny tyme greuede hym— “For he hath waged me wel as wisdome hym tauhte; Mede hath mad myne amendes ich may no more asken, So alle myne claymes ben quyt by so þe kynge asente.” “Nay, by crist,” quath þe kynge “for consciences sake, Wrong goþ nat so away ar ich wite more; Loupe he so lyghtlich lauhen he wolde, And eft be þe boldere to bete myne hewes; Bote reson haue reuthe of hym he shal reste in stockes As longe as ich lyue for hus luther werkes.” Somme radde reson þo to haue reuthe on þat shrewe, And for to consail þe kyng on conscience þei loked; Þat mede myghte be menepernour reson þei by-souhte. “Red me nat,” quaþ reson “no reuthe to haue, Til lordes and ladies louen alle treuthe, And haten alle harlotrie to huyren oþer to mouthen hit; And purneles porfil be put in þe whucche, And children cherissing be chasted with ?erdes, And harlotes holynesse be an hey ferye; Til klerken couetise be cloth for þe poure, Here pelure and here palfrayes poure menne lyflode, And religious out-ryders reclused in here cloistres, And be as benit hem bad domenik and fraunceis; Tyl þat lerede men lyue as þei lere and techen, And til þe kynges consayl be al comune profit; Tyl bisshopes [ben] bakers brewers and taylours, For alle manere men þat þei fyndeþ nedfol; Tyl seynt Iame be souht þer poure syke lyggen, In prisons and in poore cotes for pilgrymages to rome, So þat non go to galys bote it be for euere; And alle rome-renners for robbers in fraunce Bere no suluer ouer see þat kynges sygne sheweþ, Neiþer graue ne vngraue of gold ne of suluer, Vp forfeture of þe fee ho so fynt hym ouerwarde, Bote it be marchaunt oþer hus man oþer messager with lettres, Prouisour oþer prest oþer penaunt for hus synnes. And ?ut,” quaþ reson, “by þe rode ich shal no reuthe haue, Whyl mede hath þe maistrye þer motyng is atte barre. Ac ich may seye ensamples as ic see oþere; Ich seye it for my-selue,” quath reson “and hit so were, Þat ich were kyng with corone to kepe eny reame, Shold neuere wronge in þis worlde þat ich wite myghte, Be vnpunysshed in my power for peril of my soule, Ne gete my grace þorw eny gyft ne glosyng speche, Ne þorw mede do mercy by marye of heuene! For man, nullum malum mette with impunitum, And bad þat nullum bonum bee irremuneratum. Lete þy confessour, syre kyng construe þis in english, And ?if ?e worchen hit in werke ich wedde boþe myn handes, That lawe shal be a laborer and lede a felde donge, And loue shal lede þy land as þe leef lykeþ.” Clerkus þat were confessours couplede hem to-gederes, To construe this clause kyndeliche what hit menede.

Hic explicit passus quintus. PASSUS VI. Incipit passus sextus. Thus ich a-waked, god wot whanne ich wonede on cornehulle, Kytte and ich in a cote cloþed as a lollere, And lytel [y-lete] by leyue me for soþe, Among lollares of london and lewede heremytes; For ich made of þo men as reson me tauhte. For as ich cam by conscience with reson ich mette In an hote heruest whenne ich hadde myn hele, And lymes to labore with and louede wel fare, And no dede to do bote drynke and to slepe. In hele and in vnite on me aposede; Romynge in remembraunce thus reson me aratede. “Canstow seruen,” he seide “oþer syngen in a churche, Oþer coke for my cokers oþer to þe cart picche, Mowe oþer mowen oþer make bond to sheues, Repe oþer be a repereyue and a-ryse erliche, Oþer haue an horne and be haywarde and liggen oute a nyghtes, And kepe my corn in my croft fro pykers and þeeues?

Hit by-comeþ for clerkus crist for to seruen, And knaues vncrouned to cart and to worche. For shold no clerk be crouned bote yf he ycome were Of franklens and free men and of folke ywedded. Bondmen and bastardes and beggers children, Thuse by-longeþ to labour and lordes [kyn to] seruen Bothe god and good men as here degree askeþ; Some to synge masses oþer sitten and wryte, Rede and receyue þat reson ouhte spende; [Ac] sith bondemenne barnes han be mad Bisshopes, And barnes bastardes han ben archidekenes, And sopers and here sones for seluer han be knyghtes, And lordene sones here laborers and leid here rentes to wedde, For þe ryght of þis reame ryden a-?ens oure enemys, In confort of þe comune and þe kynges worshep, And monkes and moniales þat mendinauns sholden fynde, Han mad here kyn knyghtes and knyghtfees purchase[d], Popes and patrones poure gentil blod refuseþ, And taken symondes sone seyntewarie to kepe. Lyf-holynesse and loue han ben longe hennes, And wole, til hit be wered out or oþerwise ychaunged. For-þy rebuke me ryght nouht reson, ich ?ow praye; For in my conscience ich knowe what crist wolde þat ich wrouhte. Preyers of [a] parfyt man and penaunce discret Ys þe leueste labour þat oure lord pleseþ. Non de solo,” ich seide “for soþe uiuit homo, Nec in pane &amp; pabulo þe pater-noster witnesseþ; Fiat uoluntas tua, fynt ous alle þynges.” Quath conscience, “by crist ich can nat see this lyeþ; Ac it semeth nouht parfytnesse in cytees for to begge, Bote he be obediencer to pryour oþer to mynstre.” “That ys soth,” ich seide “and so ich by-knowe, That ich haue tynt tyme and tyme mysspended; And ?ut, ich hope, as he þat ofte haueþ chaffared, Þat ay hath lost and lost and [atte laste] hym happed He bouhte suche a bargayn he was þe bet euere, And sette hus lost at a lef at þe laste ende, Suche a wynnynge hym warth þorw wordes of hus grace; Simile est regnum celorum thesauro abscondito in agro, &amp; cetera: Mulier que inuenit dragmam [vnam], et cetera; So hope ich to haue of hym þat is al-myghty A gobet of hus grace and bygynne a tyme, Þat alle tymes of my tyme to profit shal turne.” “Ich rede þe,” quath reson þo “rape þe to by-gynne Þe lyf þat ys lowable and leel to þe soule”— “?e, and continue;” quath conscience and to þe [kirke] ich wente. And to þe [kirke] gan ich go god to honourie, By-for þe crois on my knees knocked ich my brest, Sykinge for my synnes seggynge my pater-noster, Wepyng and wailinge tyl ich was a slepe. Thenne mette me moche more þan ich by-fore tolde Of þe mater þat ich mette fyrst on maluerne hulles. Ich sauh þe feld ful of folk fram ende to oþer, And reson reuested ry?t as a pope, And conscience his crocer by-fore þe kynge stande. Reson reuerentliche by-for al þe reame Prechede, and prouede þat þuse pestilences Was for pure synne to punyshe þe puple; And þe south-west wynd on saterday at eue Was pertelich for prude and for no poynt elles. Piries and plomtrees were poffed to þe erthe In ensample to syggen ous we sholde do þe betere; Beches and brode okes weren blowe to þe grounde, And turned vpward here tayl in tokenynge of drede That dedlich synne er domys day shal for-do ous alle.

He bad wastours go worche and wynne here sustinaunce Þorw som trewe trauail and no tyme spille. He preide purnele here porfil to leue, And kepe hit in here cofre for catell at hure nede. He tauhte Thomme stowe to take two staues, And fecche felice home fram wyuen pyne. He warnede watte hus wif was to blame, For hure hefd was worth half mark and hus hod nat a grote. He bad bette go kutte a bowh oþer tweye, And bete beton þer-myd bote hue wolde worche. He charged chapmen to chasten here children, And lete no wynnynge for-wene hem þe while þei ben ?onge; For ho so spareþ þe spring spilleþ hus children; And so wrot þe wise to wissen us alle, Qui parcit uirge, odit filium. And sitthe he preide prelates and prestes to-geders, That hij precheþ to þe puple prouen hit hem-selue; “Lyue ?e as ?e lereþ ous we shulleþ leyue ?ow þe bettere.” And sitthe [he] radde religion here ruele to holde, “Leste þe kyng and hus consail ?oure comunes a-peyre, And be stywardes of ?oure stedes til ?e be [stewed] betere. Gregorie þe grete clerk gart write in bokes The ruele of alle religious ryghtful and obedient. Right as fisshes in flod whenne hem faileþ water, Deyen for drouthe whenne þei drye liggen, Ryght so religion roteþ and sterueth, Þat out of couent and cloistre coueyteþ to dwelle. For yf heuene be on þys erthe oþer eny eyse for saule, Hit is in cloistre oþer in scole by meny skyles ich fynde.

Freres in here freitour shulle fynde þat tyme Bred with-oute beggynge to lyue by euere after, And constantyn shal be here cook and couerer of here churche. For þe abbot of engelonde and þe abbesse hys nece Shullen haue a knok on here crounes and in-curable þe wounde; Contriuit dominus baculum impiorum, uirgam dominancium, plaga in-sanabili.

Thuse solaceþ þe soule til hym-self be-falle In a wel good hope, for he wroghte so a-mong worthy seyntes; Ther flaterers and foles with here foule wordes Leden tho þat lithen hem to luciferes feste, With turpiloquio, a lay of sorwe and lucifers fiþele, To perpetuel peyne oþer purgatorye as wykke; For he litheþ and loueþ þat godes lawe despiceþ; Qui histrionibus dat, demonibus sacrificat. Tho was repentaunce redy and radde hem alle to knele, “Ich shal by-seche for alle synfulle oure sauyour of grace, To a-menden ous of oure mysdedes do mercy to ous alle.

And for þat mochel mercy and marie loue þy moder, Haue reuthe of alle þuse rybaudes þat repenten hem sore, Þat euere þei gulte a?ens þe, god in gost oþer in dede.” Thenne hente hope an horn of deus, tu conuersus uiuificabis nos, And blew hit with beati quorum remisse sunt iniquitates, &amp; cetera, Þat alle seyntes with synful men songen with dauid, Homines &amp; iumenta saluabis, domine, quemadmodum multiplicasti misericordiam tuam, deus! A þousend of men þo þrongen to-gederes, Cryyng vpward to crist and to hus clene moder, To haue grace to go to treuthe god leyue þat þei mote! Ac þer was weye non so wys þat þe way þider couthe, Bote blostrede forth as bestes ouer baches and hulles, Til late was and longe þat þei a lede mette, A-paraild as a paynym in pylgrymes wise. He bar a bordon ybounde with a brod lyste, In a weythwynde wyse ywryþe al aboute; A bolle and a bagge he bar by hus syde, And an hondred hanypeles on hus hatte seten, Signes of syse and shilles of galys, And meny crouche on hus cloke and keyes of rome, And þe fernycle by-fore for men sholde knowe, [And se] by hus sygnes wham he souht hadde. Thys folke frayned hym furst fro whennes he come? “Fro sinay,” he sayde “and fro þe sepulcre. In bethleem, in babilonie ich haue ybe bothe, In ermanie, in alisaundre and in damascle. ?e may see by my sygnes þat sitten on my cappe, Ich haue ysouht goode seyntes for my soules helthe, And walked ful wide in wete and in drye.” “Knowst þow [ou?t] a cor-seynt,” quaþ ich “þat men clepeþ treuthe?

TESTAMENTUM PETRI PLOUHMAN. In dei nomine, amen Ich make hit my-self.

Ich payed hit prestliche for peril of my soule, He is holdinge, ich hope to haue me in hus masse, And menge me in hus memorie among alle cristine. My wyf shal haue of þat ich wan with treuthe, and no more, And dele hit among my douhtres and my dere children. For þauh ich deyde þys day my dettes ben quyted; Ich bar hom þat ich borwede er ich to bedde ?eode. With þe resydue and remenaunt by þe rode of lukes, Ich wolle worshupe þer-with treuthe al my lyf, And be a pilgrym atte plouh for profyt of poure and ryche.” Now perkyn with þe pilgrimes to þe plouh is taren; To eryen hus half aker holpen hym menye. Dykers and deluers diggeden vp þe balkes; Ther-with was perkyn apayed and paied wel here hyre. Oþer werkmen þer were þat wrouhten ful ?urne; Eche man in hus manere made hym-self to done; And somme to plese perkyn pykede aweye þe wedes. Atte hye pryme peers let þe plouh stonde, And ouer-seyh hem hym-self ho so best wrouhte, He sholde be hyred þer-after when heruest-tyme come. Þenne seten some and songen atten ale, And holpen to erie þis half acre with ‘hoy! troly! lolly!’ Quath peers [þe] plouhman al in pure tene, “Bote ?e [a]ryse þe raþere and rape ?ow to worche, Shal no greyn þat here groweþ gladen ?ow at neede; And þauh ?e deye for deul þe deuel haue [þat] recche!” Tho were faitours aferede and feynede hem blynde, And leyden here legges a-lyry as suche lorelles conneþ, And maden here mone to peers how þei mowe nat worche: “Ac we prayeþ for ?ow, peers and for ?oure plouh boþe, Þat god for hus grace ?oure grayn multiplie, And ?elde ?ow of ?oure almesse þat ?e ?euen us here.

And wrang hym by þe wombe þat al waterede hus eyen. He buffated þe brutener a-boute þe chekes, Þat he loked lyk a lanterne al hus lyf after. He bet hem so boþe he barst neih hure guttes, Ne hadde peers with a peese-lof prayede hym by-leue. “Honger, haue mercy of hem,” quath peers “and let me ?eue hem benes; And þat was bake for bayarde may be here bote.” Tho were faitours a-fered and flowen to peersses bernes, And flapten on with flailes fro morwe til euene, Þat honger was nat hardy on hem for to loke, For a potful of potage þat peersses wyf made. An hep of eremites henten hem spades, Spitten and spradde donge in despit of hunger. Thei coruen here copes and courtepies hem made, And wenten as workmen to weden and mowen; Al for drede of here deþ suche dyntes ?af [hunger.] Blynde and brokeleggede he botnede a þousande, And lame men he lechede with longen of bestes. Preestes and oþer peple to peers þei drowen, And freres [of] alle fyue ordres al for fere of hunger. For þat þat was bake for bayarde was bote for menye hungry, Drosenes and dregges drynke for menye beggeres. Þer was [no] lad þat lyuede þat ne lowede hym to peers, To be hus hole hewe þauh he hadde no more Bute lyf-lode for hus labour and hus loue at nones. Tho was peers ful proude and putte hem alle to werke, In daubyng and in deluyng in donge a-feld berynge, In þresshynge, in þecchynge in thwytynge of pynnes, And alle kynne trewe craft þat man couthe deuyse. Was no beggere so bolde bote yf he blynde were, Þat dorst with-sitte þat peeres seyde for fere of syre hunger. And peers was proud þer-of and putte hem alle to swynke, And ?af hem mete and monye as þey myght deseruen. Tho hadde peers pite of alle poure puple, And bad hunger [in] haste hyhe out of contre Home in-to his owen erthe and halde hym þer euere— “For ich am wel awreke of wastours þorw þy myghte. Ac ich praye þe,” quaþ peers “hunger, er þow wende, Of beggers and of bydders what best be to done? For ich wot wel, be þou went worche þei wolle ful ylle; Meschief his makeþ thei ben so meke nouthe, And for defaute þis folke folwen my hestes. Hit is no þyng for loue thei labour þus faste, Bote for fere of famyn in faith,” seide peers; “Ys no final loue with þis folke for al here faire speche; And hit [ben] my blody broþren for god bouhte vs alle.

Now wolde ich wite, or þow wentest what were þe beste, How ich myghte a-maistren hem to louye and laboure For here lyflode; lere me, syre hunger.” “Now herkne,” quaþ hunger “and hold hit for a wysdome; Bolde beggeres and bygge þat mowe here bred by-swynke, With houndes bred and hors-bred hele hem when þei hungren, And a-bane hem with benes for bollynge of here wombe. And yf þe gromes grucche bid hem go swynke, And he shal soupe þe swettere when he hath deserued. And yf þow fynde eny folke wham false men han apaired, Comforte hem with þy catel for so comaundeþ treuthe; Loue hem and lene hem so lawe of kynde wolde; Alter alterius onera portate.

And salamon þe sage with þe same acordeþ, The slowe caytyf for colde wolde no corn tulye; In somere for hus slewthe he shal haue defaute, And gon abrybeþ and beggen and no man bete hus hunger.

And ?ut ich sey, by my saule ich haue no salt bacon; Nouht a cokeney, by cryst colhoppes to make, Ac ich haue porett-plontes perselye and scalones, Chiboles and chiruylles and chiries sam-rede, And a cow with a calf and a cart mare, To drawe a feld my donge þe whyle drouth lasteþ.

Hunger eet al in haste and askede after more; Poure folke for fere þo fedde hunger ?erne With creym and with croddes with carses and oþer herbes. By that yt neihed heruest and newe corn com to chepyng, Thenne was þis folke feyn and fedde hunger deynteuosliche, And gloton þo with good ale gerte hunger to slepe.

Treuthe herde telle here-of and to peers sente To take hus teeme and tulye þe erthe; And purchased hym a pardon á pena et á culpa, For hym and for hus heyres for euere to be asoiled; And bad [hym] halde hym at home and erye hus leyes, And alle þat hulpe hym to erye to setten oþer to sawe, Oþer eny manere myster þat myght peers a-vayle, Pardon with peers plouhman perpetual he graunteþ. Kynges and knyghtes þat holy [kirke] defenden, And ryghtfulliche in reames ruelen þe comune, Han pardon þorw purgatorie to passy ful lyghtliche, With patriarkes and prophetes in paradyse to sitte. Bisshopes yblessed if þei ben as þei sholde, Leel and ful of loue and no lord dreden, Merciable to meek and mylde to þe goode, And bytynge on badde men bote yf þei wolde amende, And dredeþ nat for no deþ to distruye, by here powere, Lecherie a-mong lordes and hure luþer customes, And sitthen lyue as þei lereþ men oure lord treuthe hem graunteþ To be peeres to a-posteles alle puple to ruele, And deme with hem at domes day boþe quike and ded. Marchans in þe margine hadden menye ?eres, Ac á pena &amp; á culpa treuthe nolde hem graunte; For thei holden nat here halydaies as holychurche techeþ, And for þei swere by here saule and ‘so god me mote helpe!’ A?ens clene conscience for couetyse of wynnynge. Ac vnder his secre seel treuthe sente [hem] a lettere, And bad [hem] bygge baldly what [hem] best lykede, And sitthen sellen hit a-?eyn and saue þe wynnynges, Amenden meson-dieux þer-with and myseyse men fynde, And wikkede weyes with here good amende, And brygges to-broke by þe heye weyes Amende in som manere wise and maydenes helpen; Poure puple bedredene and prisones in stockes, Fynde hem for Godes loue and fauntekynes to scole; Releue religion and renten hem bettere; ‘And ich shal sende ?ow my-selue seynt Michel myn Angel, That no deuel shal ?ow dere ne despeir in ?oure deyinge, And sende ?oure soules þer ich my-self dwelle, And þere a-byde body and soule in blisse for euere.’ Tho were merchauns murye somme wepte for ioye, And preyde for peers plouhman þat purchasede hem þis bulle. Alle þe puple hadde pardon ynow þat parfytliche lyueden; Men of lawe hadde lest that loth were to plede, Bote þei pre manibus were payed for pledyng atte barre. Ac he þat speneþ hus speche and spekeþ for þe poure That innocent and nedy is and no man harme wolde, And conforteþ suche in eny cas and coueyteþ nat here ?iftes, And for þe loue of oure lorde lawe for hem declareþ, Shal haue grace of God ynow and a gret ioye after. Beþ ywar, ?e wise men and witty of þe lawe; For whenne ?e draweþ to þe deþ and indulgence wolde haue, Hus pardon is ful petit at hus partynge hennes, That mede of mene men for here motynge takeþ. For hit is symonye, to sulle þat send is of grace; That is, witt and water wynd, and fuyr þe furthe, These foure sholden be fre to alle folk þat hit [nedeþ.] Alle lybbynge laborours þat lyuen with here handes Leelyche and lawefulliche oure lord treuthe hem graunteþ Pardon perpetuel ryght as peers plouhman. Beggers and bydders beþ nat in [þat] bulle Bote þe suggestion be soth þat shapeþ hem to begge. For he þat beggeth oþer byddeþ bote yf [he] haue nede, He ys fals and faitour and defraudeþ þe [nedy,] And also gyleþ hym þat gyueþ and takeþ ageyns hus wyl. For he þat gyueþ for Godes loue wolde nat gyue, hus þankus, Bote þer he wyste hit were wel gret neede to gyuen, And most meritorie to men þat he ?eueþ for. Caton a-cordeþ þer-with cui des uideto; Wot no man, as ich wene who is worthy to haue. The most needy aren oure neighebores and we nyme good hede, As prisones in puttes and poure folke in Cotes, Charged with children and chef lordes rente, That þei [wiþ] spynnynge may spare spenen hit in hous-hyre, Boþe in mylk and in mele to make with papelotes, To a-glotye with here gurles þat greden after fode. Al-so hem-selue suffren muche hunger, And wo in winter-tyme with wakynge a nyghtes To ryse to þe ruel to rocke þe cradel, Boþe to karde and to kembe to clouten and to wasche, To rubbe and to rely russhes to pilie, Þat reuthe is to rede oþere in ryme shewe The wo [of] þese women þat wonyeþ in Cotes; And of meny oþer men þat muche wo suffren, Boþe a-fyngrede and a-furst to turne þe fayre outwarde, And beth abasshed for to begge and wolle nat be aknowe What hem needeþ at here neihebores at non and at euen. This ich wot witerly as þe worlde techeþ, What oþer by-houeþ þat hath meny children, And hath no catel bote hus crafte to cloþy hem and to fede, And fele to fonge þer-to and fewe pans takeþ. Ther is payn and peny-ale as for a pytaunce y-take, Colde flessh and cold fyssh for veneson ybake; Frydayes and fastyng-dayes [a] ferthyng-worth of muscles Were a feste for suche folke oþer so fele Cockes. These were almes, to helpe þat han suche charges, And to comfortie suche cotyers and crokede men and blynde, Ac beggers with bagges þe whiche brewhouses ben here churches, Bote þei be blynde oþer broke oþer elles be syke, Þauh he falle for defaute þat faiteþ for hus lyf-lode, Reccheþ neuere, ?e ryche þauh suche lorelles steruen. For alle þat han here hele and here eyen syghte, And lymes to laborye with and lolleres lyf vsen, Lyuen a-?ens godes lawe and lore of holy churche. And ?ut arn þer oþer beggers in hele, as hit semeþ, Ac hem wanteþ here witt men and women boþe, Þe whiche aren lunatik lollers and leperes a-boute, And mad as þe mone sitt more oþer lasse. Thei caren for no cold ne counteþ of no hete, And arn meuynge after þe mone moneyles þei walke, With a good wil, witlees meny wyde contreys, Ryght as Peter dude and Paul saue þat þei preche nat, Ne myracles maken; ac meny tymes hem happeþ To prophecien of þe puple pleyinge, as hit were, And to oure sight, as hit semeþ suthþe God hath þe myghte To ?euen eche a [wyght] wit welthe, and his hele, And suffreþ suche so gon hit semeþ, to myn Inwitt, Hit arn as hus aposteles, suche puple oþer as his priuye disciples. For he sente hem forth seluerles in a somer garnement, With-oute bred and bagge as þe bok telleþ, Quando misi uos sine pane et pera; Barfot and bredles beggeþ þei of no man. And þauh he mete with þe meyre [amyddes] þe strete, He reuerenceþ hym ryght nouht no raþer þan anoþer; Neminem salutauer[it]is per uiam. Suche manere of men matheu ous techeþ, We sholde haue hem to house and help hem when thei come; Et egenos uagosque induc in domum tuam. For hit aren murye-mouthede men mynstrales of heuene, And godes boyes, bordiours as þe bok telleþ, Si quis uidetur sapiens, fiet stultus ut sit sapiens. And alle manere mynstrales men wot wel þe soþe, To vnder-fonge hem faire by-falle[þ] for þe ryche, For þe lordes loue and ladies þat þei with lengen. Men suffren al þat suche seyn and in solas taken, And ?ut more to suche men doth er þei passe, Gyuen hem gyftes and gold for grete lordes sake. Ryght so, ?e riche raþer ?e sholde, for sothe, Welcomen and worsshepen and with ?oure goode helpen Godes mynstrales and hus messagers and hus murye bordiours; The whiche arn lunatik lollares and leperes a-boute, For vnder godes secre seel here synnes ben ykeuered. For þei bereþ no bagges ne none botels vnder clokes, The whiche is lollaren lyf and lewede eremytes, That loken ful louheliche to lacchen mennes almesse, In hope to sitten at euen by þe hote coles, Vnlouke hus legges abrod oþer lygge at hus ese, Reste hym, and roste hym and his ryg turne, Drynke drue and deepe and drawe hym þanne to bedde; And when hym lykeþ and lust hus leue ys to aryse; When he ys rysen, romeþ out and ryght wel aspieþ Whar he may raþest haue a repast oþer a rounde of bacon, Suluer oþer sode mete and som tyme boþe, A loof oþer half a loof oþer a lompe of chese; And carieþ it hom to hus Cote and cast hym to lyue In ydelnesse and in ese and by oþers trauayle. And what frek of þys folde fiskeþ þus a-boute, With a bagge at hus bak a begeneldes wyse, And can som manere craft in cas he wolde hit vse, Þorgh whiche craft he couthe come to bred and to ale, And ouer-more to an hater to helye with hus bones, And lyueþ lyk a lollere godes lawe hym dampneþ. “Lolleres lyuyng in sleuthe and ouer-londe strykers Beeþ nat in þys bulle,” quaþ peers “til þei ben amendid, Noþer beggers þat beggen bote yf þei haue neede. The bok blameþ alle beggerye and banneþ in this manere, Iunior fui, etenim senui, non uidi iustum derelictum, nec semen eius querens panem; et alibi: Infirmata est uirtus mea in paupertate. Hit needeþ nauht nouthe a-non for to preche, And lere þese lewede men what þys latyn meneþ, For hit blameþ alle beggerie be ?e ful certeyn. For þei lyue in no loue [ne] no lawe þei holden; Thei wedde non womon that þei with delen, Bringeþ forth bastardes beggers of kynde. Oþer þe bak oþer som bon þei breken of here children, And gooþ afaytyng with here fauntes for euere-more After. Þer arn mo misshapen a-mong suche beggers, Than of meny oþer men þat on þis molde walken. Tho þat lyuen þus hure lyf leyue ?e non oþere, Thei han no part of pardon of preyers, ne of penaunces. Ac olde men and hore þat helples beeþ and nedy, And wommen with childe þat worche ne mowen, Blynde men and bedreden and broken in here membres, And alle poure pacientes a-payed of godes sonde, As mesels and mendinauntes men yfalle in myschef, As prisons and pilgrimes paraunter men yrobbed, Oþer by-lowe þorwe luthere [men] and lost here catel after, Oþer thorgh fure oþer þorwe flood falle to pouerte, That taken þese meschiefes meekliche and Myldliche at herte; For loue of here lowe hertes oure lord hath hem graunted Here penaunce and here purgatorie vp-on þys pure erthe, And pardon with peers plouhman a pena &amp; a culpa. [And alle holy hermites haue schal þe same;] Ac eremites þat en-habiten by þe heye weyes, And in borwes a-mong brewesters and beggen in churches;— Al þat holy eremytes hateden and despisede, As rychesses and reuerences And ryche mennes Almesse, These lolleres, lacchedraweres lewede eremytes, Coueyten þe contrarie as cotiers þei lybben. For hit beþ bote boyes [bollers] atten ale, [Neyþer of lynage, ne of lettrure]; ne lyf-holy as eremites, That wonede [whilom] in wodes with beres and lyones. Some had lyf-lode of here lynage and of no lyf elles; And some lyuede by here lettrure and labour of here hondes; Some hadde foreynes to frendes þat hem fode sente; And bryddes brouhten to some bred wherby þei lyueden. Alle þese holy eremytes were of hye kynne, For-soke londe and lordshep and lykynges of þe body. Ac these eremytes þat edefyen thus by þe hye weyes, [Whilom] were workmen webbes and taillours, And carters knaues and clerkus with-oute grace, Helden [ful] hungry hous and hadde muche defaute, Long labour and lyte wynnynge and atte laste aspiden, That faitours in frere cloþynge hadde fatte chekus. For-thi lefte þei here laboure þese lewede knaues, And cloþed hem in copes clerkus as hit were, Oþer on of som ordre oþere elles a prophete; A-?ens þe lawe he lyueþ yf latyn be trewe; Non licet uobis legem uoluntati, sed uoluntatem coniungere legi. Now kyndeliche, by crist beþ suche callyd ‘lolleres,’ As by englisch of oure eldres of olde menne techynge. He þat lolleþ is lame oþer his leg out of ioynte, Oþer meymed in som membre for to meschief hit souneþ. And ryght so sothlyche suche manere eremytes Lollen a?en þe byleyue and lawe of holy churche. For holy churche hoteþ alle manere puple Vnder obedience to bee and buxum to þe lawe. Furst, religious, of religion here ruele to holde, And vnder obedience to be by dayes and by nyghtes; Lewede men to laborie; [and] lordes to honte In frythes and in forestes for fox and oþer bestes That in wilde wodes ben and in wast places, As wolues þat wyryeþ men wommen and children; And vp-on sonedays to cesse godes seruyce to huyre, Boþe matyns and messe and, after mete, in churches To huyre here euesong euery man ouhte. Thus it by-longeþ for lorde for lered, and lewede, Eche halyday to huyre hollyche þe seruice, Vigiles and fastyngdayes forthere-more to knowe, And fulfille þo fastynges bote infirmite hit made, Pouerte [oþer] oþere penaunces as pilgrymages and trauayles. Vnder þis obedience arn we echone; Who-so brekyþ þis, be wel war bot yf he repente, Amende hym and mercy aske and meekliche hym shryue, Ich drede me, and he deye hit worth for dedlich synne A-counted by-fore crist bote conscience excuse hym. Loke now where þese lolleres and lewede eremytes, Yf thei breke þys obedience þat ben so [fer] fro churche? Wher see we hem on sonedays þe seruyse to huyre, As, matyns by þe morwe? tyl masse by-gynne, Oþer sonedays at euesonge seo we wel fewe! Oþere labory for [here] liflode as þe lawe wolde? Ac at mydday meel-tyme ich mete with hem ofte, Comynge in a cope as he a clerke were; A bacheler oþer a beaupere best hym by-semeth; And for þe cloþ þat keuereþ hym cald is he a frere, Wassheþ and wypeþ and with þe furste sitteþ. Ac while he wrought in þys worlde and wan hus mete with treuthe, He sat atte sydbenche and secounde table; Cam no wyn in hus wombe þorw þe weke longe, Noþer blankett in hus bed ne white bred by-fore hym. The cause of al þys caitifte comeþ of meny bisshopes, That suffren suche sottes and oþere synnes regne; Certes, ho so þurste hit segge Symon quasi dormit; Vigilare were fairour for þow hast gret charge. For meny waker wolues ben broke in-to foldes; Thyne berkeres ben al blynde þat bryngeþ forth þy lambren, Dispergentur oues thi dogge dar nat berke; The tarre is vntydy þat to þyne sheep by-longeþ, Hure salue ys of supersedeas in someneres boxes; Thyne sheep are ner al shabbyd þe wolf shiteþ woolle: Sub molli pastore lupus lanam cacat, et grex In-custoditus dilaceratur eo. Hoow! hurde! wher is þyn hounde and þyn hardy herte, For to wyrie þe wolf þat þy woolle fouleþ? Ich leyue, for þy lacchesse þow leest meny wederes, And ful meny fayre flus falsliche wasshe! When þy lord lokeþ to haue a-louaunce for hus bestes, And of þe monye þow haddist þer-myd hus meoble to saue, And þe woolle worth weye woo ys þe þenne! Redde rationem uillicacionis tue oþer [in] arerage falle! Thyn hyre, hurde, as ich hope hath nouht to quyty þy dette, Ther as mede ne mercy may nat a myte auayle, Bote ‘haue þis for þat þo þat þow toke Mercy for mede and my lawe breke, Loke now for þi lacchesse whether lawe wol þe graunte Purgatorie for þy paye oþer perpetuel helle?’ For shal no pardoune praye for ?ow þer noþer princes letteres.” “Peers,” quaþ a prest þo “þy pardoune most ich rede, Ich can construen ech worde and kenne hit þe in englishe.” And peers at hus preyere þe pardon vnfolded, And ich by-hynde hem boþe by-heeld al þe bulle. In two lynes hit lay and no lettere more, And was ywryte ryght þus in witnesse of treuthe. Qui bona egerunt ibunt in uitam eternam: Qui uero mala, in ignem eternum. “Peter!” quaþ þe prest þo “ich can no pardon fynde, Bote ‘do wel and haue wel and god shal haue þy saule, Do vuel and haue vuel and hope þow non oþer Bote he þat vuel lyueþ vuel shal ende!’” The preest þus and perkyn of þe pardon Iangled. Throgh here wordes ich awook and waitede aboute, And seih þe sonne in þe south sitte þat tyme. Meteles and moneyles on maluerne hulles, Musynge on þis meteles a myle-wey ich ?eode. And meny tymes this meteles made me to studie Of þat ich seih slepynge yf hit so be myghte, And of peers plouhman [ful] pensyf in herte, And which a pardon peers hadde the puple to gladen, And how þe preest inpugned hit thorwe two propre wordes. Ac men setten nat by songewarie men seen hit ofte faile, Caton counteþ hit at nouht and canonistres at lasse. Ac for þe bok bible bereþ good wyttnesse, How daniel dyuinede and vndude þe dremeles Of kyng nabugodonosor þat no peer hadde, And sitthe after to hus sones seide hem what þei thouhte:— And Ioseph mette meruelousliche how þe mone and þe sonne And elleuene sterres hailsede hym alle; Thenne Iacob Iuged Iosephes sweuene: “Beau fitz,” quaþ þe fader “we shulleþ for defaute, Ich my-self and my sones seche [þe] for neede;” Hit by-fel as þe fader seide in [pharaoes] tyme, Þat Ioseph was Iustice egipte to saue; Hus eleuene broþeres hym for neede souhte, And hus fader Iacob and al-so hus dame:— Al þis makeþ me on meteles to studie, And how þe preest preuede no pardon to do-wel; And demede þat dowel Indulgences passede, Byennals and tryennals and bisshopes letteres. For ho so doþ wel here at þe daye of dome Worth faire vnderfonge by-for god þat tyme. So dowel passeþ pardon and pilgrimages to rome; ?ut hath þe pope power pardon to graunte To puple, with-oute penaunce to passen in-to Ioye, As lettred men ous lereþ and lawe of holy churche: Quodcunque ligaueris super terram erit ligatum &amp; in celis; Et quodcunque solueris super terram erit solutum &amp; in celis. And so ich by-leyue leelly lordes forbode elles, Þat pardon and penaunce and preieres don saue Saule[s] þat han synged seuene sithe[s] dedliche.

At þe dredful day of dome when dede men shullen ryse, And comen alle by-fore crist a-countes to ?elde, Howe we ladde oure lyf here and hus lawes kepte, And how we dude day by day þe dome wol reherce. A poke-ful of pardon þere ne prouincials letteres, Þauh [we] be founde in fraternite of alle fyue ordres, And haue indulgences doblefolde bote dowel ous helpe, Ich sette by pardon nat a peese noþer a pye hele! For-thi ich counsaile alle cristine to crye god mercy, And marye hus moder be oure mene to hym, Þat god ?eue ous grace here er we go hennes, Suche workes to worche whil we ben here, That after oure deþ-day dowel reherce At þe day of dome we dude as he tauhte. —Amen. Hic explicit uisio willelmi de petro plouhman. Visio eiusdem Willelmi de Do-wel. PASSUS XI. (DO-WEL I.) Incipit uisio eiusdem Willelmi de dowel. Thus robed in russett ich romede a-boute, Al a somer seson for to seke dowel, [And] frainede ful ofte of folke þat ich mette, Yf eny wiht wist wher dowel was at ynne, And what man he myghte be of meny man ich askede. Was neuere wiht in þis worlde þat wisse me couthe, Wher þat he longede lasse ne more; Til hit by-ful on a frydaye two freres ich mette, Maisteres of [þe] menours men of grete witte. Ich hailsede hem hendilyche as ich hadde ylerned, And prayede pur charite ar þei passede forþere, Yf þei knew eny contreie oþer costes a-boute, Wher þat dowel dwelleþ— “dere frendes, telleþ me; For ?e aren men of þys molde þat most wide walken, And knowen contreies and courtes and menye kynne places, Boþe princes paleis and poure menne Cotes, And dowel and do-vuele wher þei dwellen boþe.” “Sothliche,” seide þe frere “he soiourneþ with ous freres, And ay hath, as ich hope and [euer] wol her-after.” “Contra,” quaþ ich as a clerke and comsede to dispute, And seide sothliche “septies in die cadit iustus, Fallynge fro ioye iesus wot þe sothe! ‘Seuene sythes,’ seith þe bok ‘syngeþ day by day The alþer-ryghtfulleste renk þat regneþ vpon erthe.’ And ho so syngeþ,” ich seide “certys, doþ nat wel; For ho so syngeþ sikerliche doþ vuele, And dowel and do-vuele may nat dwelle to-gederes. Ergo, he ys nat al-way at hom among ?ow Freres; He is som while elles-wher to wisse þe puple.” “Ich shal sei þe, my sone,” seide þe frere þenne, “How seuene sithes þe sadde man syngeþ on þe day. By a forbusene,” quaþ þe frere “ich shal þe faire shewe. Let brynge a man in a bot in-myddes a brode water; The wynde and þe water and waggynge of þe bote Makeþ þe man meny tyme to stomble, yf he stande; Stonde he neuere so styfliche þorgh sterynge of þe bote He bendeþ and boweþ þe body is vnstable, Ac ?ut he is saf and sounde; so fareth hit by þe ryghtful. Þauh he falle, he falleþ nat bote as ho fulle in a bote, Þat ay is saf and sounde þat sitteþ with-ynne þe borde. So hit fareþ,” quaþ þe frere “by ryghtful mannes fallynge; Þawe he þorgh fondinge falle he falleþ nat out of charite; So dedliche synne doþ he nat for dowel hym helpeþ. The water ys likned to þe worlde þat wanyeþ and wexeþ; The godes of [þis] grounde aren lyke to þe grete wawes, [Þat] as wyndes and wederes walwen a-boute; The bot ys lykned to oure body þat brotel ys of kynde, That þorgh þe fende and oure flesch and þis frele worlde Syngeþ seuene sithes þe saddest man on erthe, And lyfholiest of lyf þat lyueth vnder þe sonne. Ac free wil and free wit folweþ a man euere To repenten and ryse and rowen out of synne, To contricion, to confession til he come to hus ende. Raþer haue we no reste til we restitue Our lyf to oure lord god for oure lykames gultes.” “Ich haue no kynde knowyng,” quaþ ich “to conceyue al þy speche, Ac yf ich may lyue and loke ich shal go lerne bettere.” “Ich by-kenne þe Crist,” quaþ he “þat on þe croice deide.” And ich seide, “þe same saue ?ow fro meschaunce, And gyue me grace on þis grounde with good ende to deye.” Ich wente forþ wyde where walkynge myn one, In a wylde wyldernesse by a wode syde. Blisse of [þe] briddes a-byde me made, And vnder lynde in a launde lenede ich a stounde, To lithen here laies and here loueliche notes. Murthe of here murye mouthes made me to slepe; And merueilousliche me mette a-myddes al þat blisse. A muche man, me þouhte lyke to my-selue, Cam and callede me by my [kynde] name. “What art þow?” quaþ ich “þat my name knowest?” “That wost þou, wille,” quaþ he “and no wight betere.” “Wot ich,” quaþ ich, “ho art þow?” “thouhte,” seide he þenne; “Ich haue þe suwed þis seue ?er seih þou me no rather?” “Art þow þouhte?” quaþ ich þo “þow couþest me wisse Where þat dowel dwelleþ and do me to knowe?” “Dowel and dobet,” quaþ he “and dobest þe þridde Beþ þre fayre vertues and beeþ nauht ferr to fynde. Who-so is trewe of hys tonge and of hus two handes, And þorw leel labour lyueþ and loueþ his emcristine, And þer-to trewe of hus tail and halt wel his handes, Nouht dronkelewe ne deynous dowel hym folweþ. Dobet doþ al this ac ?ut he doþ more; He is lowe as a lombe and loueliche of speche, And helpeth herteliche alle men of þat he may aspare. The bagges and þe by-gurdeles he hath to-broke hem alle, That þe eorl auerous heeld, and hus eires; And of mammonaes moneye mad hym meny frendes, And is ronne in-to religion and rendreþ hus byble, And precheþ to þe puple seynt poules wordes; Libenter suffertis insipientes, cum sitis ipsi sapientes; ‘?e worldliche wyse vnwyse þat ?e suffre, Lene hem and loue hem’ this latyn ys to mene. Dobest bere sholde þe bisshopes croce, And halye with [þe] hoked ende ille men to goode, And with þe pyk putte adoune preuaricatores legis, Lordes þat lyuen as hem lust and no lawe a-counten; For here mok and here meeble suche men þynken That no Bisshop sholde here byddinge with-sitte. Ac dobest sholde nat dreden [hem] bote do as god hihte, Nolite timere eos qui possunt occidere corpus. Thus dowel and dobet diuinede, and dobest, And crounede on to be kyng to culle with-oute synne That wolde nat don as dobest diuinede and tauhte. Thus dowel and dobet and dobest þe þridde Crounede on to be kyng and kepen ous alle, And reulen alle reaumes by here þre wittes; Bote oþer-wise ne elles nat bote as þei þree assented.” Ich þonked þouht þo þat he me so tauhte: “?ut sauereþ me nat þi sawe,” quaþ ich “so me crist spede, A more kynde knowyng coueite ich to huyre Of dowel and of dobet and dobest of alle.” “Bote wit wolle þe wisse,” quaþ þouht “wher þo þre dwellen; Elles know ich non þat can in none kynriche.” Thouht and ich thus þre daies to-gederes we ?eoden, Disputynge vp dowel daye after oþere; And er we were ywar with wit gan we mete. He was long and lene lyke to non oþer, Was no pruyde in hus aparail ne pouerte noþer; Sad of hus semblant with a softe speche. Ich [dorste] meue no matere to maken hym to Iangle, Bote as ich bad thouht þo be mene by-twene, And putte forth som purpos to prouen hus wittes, What dowel was fro dobet and dobest fro hem boþe. Thenne thouht in þat tyme seide þese wordes, “Wher dowel and dobet and dobest ben in londe Her is on wolde wite yf wit couthe teche, And what lyues thei lyuen and what lawe þei vsen; What þei drede and douten dere syre, telleþ.” “Syre dowel dwelleþ,” quaþ wit “nat a daye hennes, In a castle þat Kynde made of foure kyne þynges; Of erthe, of aier yt is made medled to-gederes, With wynd and water wittyliche en-ioyned. Kynde hath closed þer-ynne craftilyche with alle A lemman þat he loueþ wel lyke to hym-selue; Anima hue hatte to hure hath enuye A prout prikyere of fraunce princeps huius mundi; And wolde wynne hure away with wiles, yf he myghte. And kynde knoweth þis wel and kepeth hure þe betere, And dooþ hure with syre dowel duk of þes marches. Dobet ys here damesele syre doweles douhter, To serue þat lady leelly boþe late and rathe. Dobest ys a-boue boþe a bisshopes peer, And by hus lerynge is ladde þat ilke lady anima. The constable of þat castel þat kepeþ hem alle Is a wys knyght with alle syre Inwit he hatte; And haþ fyue faire sones by hus furste wyf, Syre seewel, syre seiwel syre huyrewel þe hende, Syre worchewel with þyn hand a wight man of strengthe, And syre godfaith gowel grete lordes alle. These fyue ben ysett for to sauye anima, Til kynde come oþer sende and kepe hure hym-self.” “What lyues þyng is kynde?” quaþ ich “can[st] þow me telle?” “Kynde is [a creator],” quaþ wit “of alle kyne þynges, Fader and formour of al þat forth groweþ, The whiche is god grettest þat gynnynge hadde neuere, Lord of lyf and of lyght of lysse and of payne. Angeles and alle þyng aren at hus wil; Man is hym most lyk of membres and of face, And semblable in soule to god bote yf synne hit make. And as þow suxt þe sonne som tyme for cloudes May nat shyne ne shewe on shawes on erthe, Right so letteþ lecherie and oþer luther synnes, Þat god suweþ nat synful men and suffreþ hem mysfare, As somme hongen hem-self and oþer while a-drencheþ; God wol nat of hem wite bote leteþ hem yworthe, As þe sauter seiþ by such synful shrewes, Et dimisi eos secundum desideria [cordis] eorum.

Inwitt and alle wittes closed ben þer-ynne; By loue and by leaute þer-by lyueþ anima; And lyf lyueþ by Inwitt and lerynge of kynde. Inwitt is in þe hefd as Anima [in] þe herte, And muche wo worth hym þat Inwitt mys-speyneþ. For þat is godes owen good hus grace and hus tresoure, That meny lede leeseþ thorw lykerouse drynke, As lot dude and noe; and herodes þe daffe ?af hus douhter for [a] daunsyng in a dissh þe hefde Of þe blessyde baptiste by-fore alle hus gustes. Every man þat hath ynwitt and hus hele boþe, Hath tresour ynow in treuthe to fynde with hym selue. Ac fauntekynes and fooles þe whiche fauten Inwitt, Frendes [schulden] fynden hem and fro folye kepe, And holychurche helpe to so sholde no man begge, Ne spille speche ne tyme ne myspende neiþer Meeble ne vnmeeble mete noþer drynke. And þanne dude we alle wel and ?ut wel bet to louye Oure enemyes entyreliche and help hem at here neede. And ?ut were best to bee aboute and brynge hit to hepe, That alle londes loueden and in on lawe by-leouede. Bisshopes sholde be here-aboute and brynge þis to hepe, For to leese þere-fore here londe and here lyf after. The catel þat crist hadde þre cloþes hit were, Ther-of was [he] ryfled and robbed er he deyede; After þat he les hus lyf for lawe sholde loue wexe. Prelates and preestes and princes of holy churche Sholde doute no deþ noþer dere ?eres, To wenden as wyde as þe worlde were, To tulien the erthe with tonge and teche men to louye; For ho so loueþ, leyue hit wel god wol nat lete hym sterue In myschef for lacke of mete ne for myssynge of cloþes; Inquirentes autem dominum non minuentur omni bono. Ho so lyueþ in lawe and in loue doþ wel As these weddid men þat þis worlde susteynen? For of here kynde thei come confessours and [martyres,] Patriarkes and prophetes popes and maidenes. For god seith hit hym-self ‘shal neuere good appel Þorw no sotel science on sour stock growe;’ And hit ys no more to mene bote men þat buth bygetyn Out of matrimonie nat moillere mowe nat haue þe grace That leelle legitime by lawe may cleyme. And þat my sawe be soth þe sauter bereþ witnesse, Concepit in dolore, &amp; peperit iniquitatem. Caym þe cursed creature conceyued was in synne, After þat adam and eue hadden ysynged; With-oute repentaunce of here rechelesnesse, A rybaud þei engendrede and a gome vnryghtful. As an hewe þat ereþ nat auntreþ hym to sowe On a leye-lond a-?ens hus lordes wille, So was caym conceyued and so been cursed wrecches, That lycame han a-?en þe lawe þat oure lord ordeynede. Alle þat come of caym caytyues were euere, And for þe synne of caymes sed seyde god to noe, Penitet me fecisse hominem; And bad shape hym a schip of shides and of bordes, ‘Thy-selue and þy sones þree and sitthen ?oure wyues, Buske ?ow to þat bot [and] a-bydeþ þer-ynne Tyl fourty dayes be fulfilled and [þe] flod haue wasshe Clene away þe cursede blod that of cayme ys spronge. Bestes þat now beeþ banne shulleþ þe tyme That euere þat cursed cayme cam on this erthe; Alle shullen deye for hus dedes by dales and hulles, And þe foules þat flen forth with othere bestes, Except onliche of eche kynde a peyre, That in þy shynglede schip with the shal be saued.’ Here abou?te þe barn hus belsires gultes, And alle for here for-fadres ferden þe worse. The godspel ys her-ageyn as gomes may reden, Filius non portabit iniquitatem patris, [nec pater iniquitatem filij.] Holy writ wittnesseþ þat for no wickede dede That the sire hym-self doþ by hus owene wil, The sone for [þe] syres synne sholde nat be þe werse. West-mynster lawe, ich wot wel worcheþ þe contrarie; For þauh þe fader be a frankelayne and for a felon be hanged, The heritage þat þe air sholde haue ys at þe kynges wille. Ac þe godspel ys a glose þere hudynge þe greythe treuthe; For god seide ensample of suche manere isshue, That kynde folweþ kynde and contrarieþ neuere; Nunquam colligunt de spinis vuas: &amp; alibi, Bona arbor bonum fructum facit. Ac whi þe worlde was a-drent holy writ telleþ, Was for mariages of man-kynde þat men maden þat tyme. After þat caym þe cursede hadde culled abel, Seth, Adames sone sitthen was engendred. And god sente to seth so sone he was of age, That—for no kyne catel ne no kyne byheste Suffren hus seed seeden with caymes seed hus broþer. And for þat seth suffrede hit god seide, ‘me forþynkeþ That ich man made oþere matrimonye suffrede; For good sholde wedden good þauh þei no good hadde, For ich am uia &amp; ueritas and may auaunce hem alle.’ Ac fewe folke [now] folweþ this for thei ?eueþ here children For couetise of catel and connynge chapmen; Of kyn ne of kynredene a-counteþ men bote lytel. Þauh hue be loueliche to loken on and lofsom a bedde, A mayde wel ymanered of good men [y]spronge, Bote hue haue eny oþer good haue hure wol no ryche.

And euerech manere seculer man þat may nat contynue, Wisliche go wedde and war þe fro þat synne That lecherye is, a lykynge þyng and lym-?erde of helle. And whil þow art ?ong and ?ep and þy wepne kene, Awreke þe þerwith on wyuynge for godes werk ich holde hit: Dum sis uir fortis ne des tua robora scortis, Scribitur in portis meretrix est ianua mortis. ?e þat han wyues, beþ war worcheþ nat out of tyme, As adam dude and eue as ich whil er tolde. For sholde no bed-borde be bote yf þei boþe were Clene of lyf and loue in saule and in leel wedlok. For þat derne dede do no man sholde Bote wedded men with here wyues as holy writ telleþ; Bonum est ut unusquisque uxorem suam habeat, propter fornicacionem.

Ac he þat haþ holy writ aye in hus mouthe, And can telle of treuthe and of þe twelue apostels, Oþer of þe passion of crist oþer of purgatorie peynes, Lytel is he a-lowed þere-fore among lordes [at] festes. Nowe is þe manere atte mete when mynstralles ben stylle, The lewede a-?ens þe lered þe holy lore to dispute, And tellen of þe trinite how two slowe þe þridde, And brynge forth ballede resones and taken bernarde to witnesse, And putteþ forþ presompcions to preouen þe sothe. Thus thei dreuelen atte deyes þe deyte to knowe, And gnawen god with gorge when here guttes fullen. Ac þe carful mai crie and quaken atte ?ate, Boþe a-fyngred and a-furst and for defaute spille, Ys non so hende to haue hym yn bote hote hym go þer god is!

Freres and faitours han founde vp suche questiones To plese with proute men sitthe þe pestilences, [And preching at seint poules in pure enuye of clerkes,] That folk is nouht ferm in þe feith ne free of here goodes, Ne sory for here synnes; so is pruyde en-hansed In religion and al þe reame among ryche and poure, That preyeres han no power these pestilences to lette. For god is def now a dayes and deyneþ nouht ous to huyre, And good men for oure gultes he al to-grynt to deþe; And ?ut þese wrecches of þys worlde is non y-war by oþer, Ne for drede of eny deþ with-draweþe hem fro pruyde, Ne parteþ with þe poure as pure charyte wolde, Bote in gayenesse and in glotenye for-glotten here goodes, And brekeþ nat here bred to þe poure as þe book hoteþ; [Frange esurienti panem tuum; et egenos vagosque induc in domum tuam.] Ac þe more he hath, and wynneþ þe-world at hus wylle, And lordeþ in leedes the lasse good he deleþ. Tobie tauhte nat so takeþ hede, ?e ryche, How he tolde in a tyme and tauhte hus sone dele: Si tibi sit copia, abundanter tribue: si autem exiguum, illud impertiri libenter stude.

When ich was war of hus wille to þat womman ich loutede, And seide, “mercy, ma dame ?oure man shal ich worthe As longe as ich lyue bothe late and rathe, And for to worche ?oure wil the while my lyf dureþ, With þat ?e kenne me kyndeliche to knowe what is dowel.” “For thi meeknesse,” quaþ hue “and for thi mylde speche, Ich shal þe kenne to clergie my cosyn, þat knoweth Alle kyne konnynges and comsynges of dowel, Of dobet and dobest for doctor he is yknowe, And of scripture þe skylful and scryuaynes were trewe.

Ac yf þou happe,” quaþ hue “þat þow hitte on clergie, And hast vnderstondyng what he wolde mene, Sey to hym þy-self ouer-see my bokes, And seye ich grette wel hus wif ich wrot hure a byble, And sette hure to sapience and to þe sauter glosed. Logyk ich lerede hure and al þe lawe after, Alle þe musons in musyk ich made hure to knowe. Plato þe poete ich putte hym ferst to booke, Aristotle and oþere to arguen ich tauhte. Grammere for gurles ich gart furst wryte, And bet hem with a baleyse bote yf þei wolde lerne. Of alle kyne craftes ich contreeuede here tooles, Of carpentrie, of kerueres and contreeuede þe compas, And cast out by squire boþe lyne and leuell. Thus þorw my lore beþ men ylered þauh ich loke dymme. Ac theologie haþ teened me ten score tymes, The more ich muse þer-on the mystiloker hit semeþ, And þe deppere ich deuyne the derker me þynkeþ hit. Hit is no science sothliche bote a sothfast by-leyue; Ac for hit lereþ men to louye ich by-leyue þer-on þe bettere. For loue is a lykynge thyng and loth for to greue; Lerne for to louye yf þe lyke dowel, For of dobet and of dobest here doctor is dere loue.” Tho wente ich my way with-oute more lettynge, And to clergie ich kam as clerkes me seide, And ich grette hym goodliche and greiþliche hym told, How þat wit and hus wif wissed me to hym, To [kenne] and to knowe kyndeliche dowel. “By cryst,” quaþ clergie “yf þow coueyte dowel, Kep þe ten commaundemens and kep þe fro synne; And by-leyf leelly how godes sone a-lyghte On þe mayde marie for mankynnes sake, And by-cam man of þat mayde with-oute mannes kynde. And al þat holy churche here-of can þe lere, By-leyf lelly þere-on and look þow do þer-after. Her-of austin þe olde made bokes and bokes; Ho was hus autor and him of god tauhte? Patriarkes and prophetes aposteles and angeles And þe holy trinite to austyn appeirede, And he ous scide as he seih and so ich by-leyue, That he seih þe syre and þe sone and seynte spirit togederes, And alle þre bote on God and her-of made he bokes, ?e, busiliche bokes; ho [beþ] hus wytnesses? Ego in patre &amp; pater in me [est;] et qui me vidit, patrem meum uidit qui in celis est. Alle þe clerkes vnder crist ne couthe this asoile; Bote thus by-longeþ to by-leyue alle þat lykeþ dowel. For hadde neuere frek fyn wit þe faith to dispute, Ne man myghte haue no merit þer-of myghte hit be preoued; Fides non habet meritum ubi humana racio [prebet experimentum.] Thus by-leyue and leaute and loue is þe þridde, That makeþ men to dowel dobet, and dobest.” [Þanne] scripture scorned me and many skyles shewede, And contynaunce made to clergie to congie me, hit semede, And lakkede me in latyn and lyght by me sette, And seide, “multi multa sapiunt, &amp; seipsos nesciunt.” Tho wepte ich for wo and wraþede of [here] wordes, And in a wynkynge ich worth and wonderliche ich mette. For ich was raueshed ryght þer; fortune me fette, In-to þe londe of longynge and loue hue me brouhte, And in a myrour, hihte myddelerd hue made me to loke, And sutthe seide to me “her myghte þou see wondres, And knowe þat þow coueitest and come þer-to, paraunter.” Thenne hadde fortune folwynge hure two faire maidenes, Concupiscentia-carnis me calde þe eldere mayde, And couetyse-of-eyen ycald was þat oþere. And pruyde-of-parfit-lyuynge! pursewede [me] faste, And bad me for my contynence counte clergies lore lyght. Concupiscentia-carnis comfortyde me in þys wyse, And seide, “þow art ?ong and ?ep and hast ?eris ynowe For to lyue longe and ladyes to louye. And in þis mirour þow my?t see murthes ful menye, That lede þe wol to lykynge al þy lyf-tyme.” The secounde mayde seide “ich shal sewe þi wil; Til þow be a lord of londe leten þe ich nelle, That ich ne shal folwie þy felaushupe yf fortune lyke.” “He shal fynde me hus frende” quaþ fortune herafter; “That man þat me lykeþ helpe myghte nat myshappe.” Thenne was þer on hiht elde þat heuy was of chere; “Man,” quaþ elde, “mete ich with þe by marie of heuene! Thou shalt fynde fortune faile at þy moste neede, And concupiscentia-carnis clene the for-sake! Byterliche shalt þow banne þenne boþe [dayes] and nyghtes Couetyse-of-eyen that euere þow hure knewe, And pruyde-of-parfit-lyuynge to muche peril þe brynge.” “?e, recche the neuere,” quaþ rechelesness stod forth in raggede cloþes, “Folwe forþ þat fortune wol thou hast ful fer to elde; A man may stoupe tyme ynowe when he shal tyne þe corone!” Syre wanhope was sibbe to hym as som men me tolde, For rechelesnesse in hus rybaudrie ryht þus he seide, “Go ich to helle, go ich to heuene ich shal nouht [go] myn one! Were hit al soþ þat ?e seyen thou scripture and clergie, Ich leyue neuere þat lorde ne ladie þat lyueþ her on erthe Sholde sitte in godes sete ne see god in hus blysse; Ita impossibile est diuiti intrare in regnum celorum, sicut camelus foramen acus. For clergie seith þat he seih in þe seynt euangelie, Þat ich man maked was and my name y-entred In þe legende of lif longe er ich were. Predestinat thei prechen prechours þat þis shewen, Or prechen inparfit ypult out of grace, Vnwryten for som wikkednesse as holy writ sheweth, Nemo ascendit in celum nisi qui de celo descendit. Ich leyue hit wel, by oure lorde and no lettrure bettere. For salomon þe sage þat sapience made, God gaf hym grace of wit and of good after, Neuere to man so muche that man can of telle, To rewele alle reames and ryche to make, And deme wel and wislyche wommen bereþ witnesse; Non michi nec tibi, sed diuidatur. Aristotle and he hij tauhten men boþe; Maisters þat techen men of godes muchel mercy Witnessen þat here wordes and here werkes boþe Weren wonder goode and wise in here tyme, And holychurche, as ich huyre haldeþ boþe in helle! Yf we sholden worchen after here workes to wynnen ous heuene, That for hure werkes and witt wonyeþ now in peyne, Then wroghte we vnwisliche for al ?oure wyse techynge. Ac ich countresegge þe nat, cleregie ne þy connynge, scripture; That ho so doþ by ?oure doctrine doþ wel, ich leyue. Ac me were leuere, by oure lorde a lippe of godes grace Than al þe kynde witt þat ?e can boþe and connynge of ?oure bokes. For of fele witty, in faith litel ferly ich haue, Thauh here gost be vngraciouse god for to plese. For meny men of þis molde setten more here herte In worldliche good þan in god for-þy grace hem failleþ. At here moste meschef mercy were þe beste; And mercy of mercy needes mot aryse, As holy writ wittnesseþ godes word in the godspelle; Eadem mensura qua mensi fueritis, remecietur uobis. Ryght wel ywittede men and wel lettred clerkes, Selde arn þei seien so lyue as þei lere; Witnesse on godes wordes þat was neuere vntrewe: Super cathedram moysi [sederunt,] &amp;c. [Ac] ich wene hit worth of menye as was in Noes tyme, Tho þat he shop þe schip of shides and of bordes, Was neuere wright þat þer-on wrouhte ne workman ysaued, Bote briddes and bestes [and] þe blessed Noe, And hus wif with hus sones and hus sones wyues; [Of] wrightes þat hit wroghten was non ysaued. God leyue hit fare nat so by folke that þe faith techen Of holychurche, þat sholde kepe alle cristine saules; For archa noe, nymeþ hede ys no more to mene Bote holychurche, herbergh to alle þat ben blessede. The culorum of this c[l]ause curatores ys to mene, That ben carpenters vnder criste holy [kirke] to make For lewede folke, godes foules and hus free bestes; Homines &amp; iumenta saluabis, domine, &amp;c. At domes day a dyluuye worth of deþ and fuyr at ones; Worcheþ, ?e wryghtes of holichurche as holy writ techeþ, Lest ?e be loste as þe laborers were þat labored vnder Noe. A goode fryday, ich fynde a felon was ysaued, That vnlawefulliche hadde ylyued al hus lyf-tyme; And for he by-knew on þe crois and to crist schrof hym, He was sonnere ysaued þan seynt Iohan þe Baptist, And er Adam oþer ysaie oþer eny of þe prophetes, That hadden leye with lucyfer meny longe ?eres. A robber was y-raunsoned raþer þan þei alle; With-oute penaunce oþer passion oþer eny oþer peyne He passede forth pacientliche to perpetuel blisse. Al-so marie Magdelene ho myghte do worsse As in lykynge of lecherye no lyf denyede? And dauid þe douhty þat deuynede how vrye Mighte slilokeste be slayn and sente hym to werre Leelliche as by hus lok with a lettere of gyle; Paul þe apostel, þat no pite hadde cristene peuple to culle; Now beeþ þese seintes, as men seyen and souereynes in heuene, Tho þat worst wroghten while þei weren here. By þat þat salamon seith hit semeþ þat no wyght Wot ho is worthi for wele oþer for wicke, Whether he is worthi to wele oþer to wickede pyne: Sunt iusti atque sapientes, &amp; opera eorum in manu Dei sunt. Thus ich, rechelesnesse, haue rad registres and bokes, And fond ich neuere, in faith for to telle treuthe, That clergie of cristes mouth comended was euere. For crist seide to seintes and to suche as he louede, Dum steteritis ante reges et presides, [nolite cogitare quomodo aut quid loquamini,] &amp; cetera: ‘Thauh ?e come by-fore kynges and clerkes of þe lawe, Beeþ nat a-ferd of þat folke for ich shal ?eue ?ow tonge, Connynge and clergie to conclude hem alle.’ Dauid makeþ mencion he spak among kynges, And myghte no kynge hym ouer-come as in connynge speche. Sothly,” seide rechelesnesse “ich see by menye euydences, That noþer wit ne wyghtnesse wan neuere þe maistrie With-oute þe grete gyfte of god with hus grace and fortune. For he þat most [seih] and seide of þe sothfast trinite Was Austyn þe olde þat euere man wiste. He saide thus in hus sarmon for ensample of grete clerkes, Ecce ipsi idioti rapiunt celum, vbi nos sapientes in inferno mergimur. This is to mene no more to men þat ben lewede, ‘Aren none raþere raueshed fro þe ryghte by-leyue Cominliche þan clerkes most knowynge and connynge; And none sonnere ysaued ne saddere in þe by-leyue Than plouhmen and pastours and poure comune peuple;’ And lewede leele laborers and land-tylynge peuple Persen with a pater-noster paradys oþer heuene, Passinge purgatorie penaunceles for here parfit by-leyue, Breuis oratio penetrat celum. Selde falleþ þe seruant so deepe in arerages As doþ þe reyue oþer þe conterroller þat rekene mot and a-counte Of al þat þei hauen had of hym þat is here maister. Ac þese lewede laborers of lytel vnderstondynge Selde fallen so foule and so deepe in synne As clerkes of holy churche þat kepen sholde and saue Lewede men in good by-leyue and lene hem at here neede. ‘Homo proponit,’ quaþ [a] poete þo and plato he hihte, ‘Et deus disponit,’ quaþ he ‘let god do hus wille.’ Al þat treuthe a-tacheþ and testifieþ for goode, Thauh thei folwe þat fortune wole no folie ich hit holde. And concupiscentia-carnis shal þe nat greue Gretlich, ne by-gyly þe bote yf þy-self wolle.” “?e, farewel, fyppe!” quath fauntelet and forth gan me drawe, Til concupiscentia-carnis a-corded to alle my werkes. Of dowel ne of dobet no deynte me þouhte, Clergie and hus consail ich countede ful lytel! Hic explicit passus secundus de dowel. PASSUS XIII. (DO-WEL III.) Incipit passus tercius [de dowel.] “Alas, eye!” quath elde and holynesse boþe, “Þat wit shal turne to wrecchednesse for welthe haþ al hus wil!” Couetise-of-eyen confortede me after, And seide, “rechelesnesse recche þe neuere! By so þow riche were haue þow no conscience How þat þow come to good; confesse þe to som frere, He shal a-soile þe thus sone how [so] þow euere wynne hit. For while fortune is þy frend freres wollen þe louye, And fastne þe in here fraternite and for þe by-seche To here priour prouincial hus pardon to haue, And praye for þe, pol by pol yf þow be [pecunyous;] Pena pecuniaria non sufficit, et cet.” By wissynge of þis wenche ich dude hure wordes were so swete, Til ich for-?at ?outhe and ?orn in-to elde. Thenne was fortune my foo for al here fayre by-heste, And pouerte pursuwede me and putte me to be lowe, And flittynge fond ich þe frere þat me confessede, And seide, ‘he myghte me nat a-soile bote ich suluer hadde To restitue resonabliche for al vnryghtful wynnynge.’ “Owh! how!” quaþ ich þo and myn hefd waggede, “By my faith, frere,” quaþ ich “?e fare lik þe wou-were That wilneþ þe wydewe bote for to wedde here goodes. Ryght so, by þe rode,” quaþ ich “rouhte þe neuere Wher my body yburied were by so ?e hadde my goodes!” Thanne lowh leaute for ich lourede on þe frere; “Whi lourest þow?” quaþ leaute “leue syre,” ich seide, “For this frere flaterede me while he fond me riche; Now ich am poure and penyles at litel prys he set me: Ich wolde hit were no synne,” ich seide “to seye þat were treuthe. The sauter seith hit is no synne for suche men as ben trewe For to seggen as thei seen and saue onliche prestes; Existimasti inique quod ero tui similis; arguam te, &amp; statuam contra faciem tuam. Thei wollen a-leggen al-so and by þe godspel preouen hit, Nolite iudicare quemquam.” “Wher-of serueþ lawe,” quaþ leaute “and no lyf vndertoke Falnesse ne faiterie? for som-what þe apostel seide, Non oderis fratrem tuum secrete in corde [tuo.] Thyng þat al þe worlde wot where-fore sholdest þow spare To rehercen hit by retoryk to a-rate dedliche synne? Ac be þow neuer þe furste the defaute to blame; Thauh þow see, sey nat som tyme, þat is treuthe. Thyng þat wolde be pryue publisshe þow hit neuere, Noþer for loue labbe hit out ne lacke hit for non enuye; Parum lauda, uitupera parcius.” “He seith soth,” quaþ scripture [þo] and skypte an hy, and prechede, Ac þe matere þat hue meeuede yf lewede men hit knewe, Þe lasse, as ich leyue louye þei wolde The by-leyue of oure lorde þat lettrede men techen. Of here teme and of here tales ich took ful good hede; Hue seide in here sarmon selcouthe wordes:— “Multi to a mangerie and to þe mete were sompned, And whan þe peuple was plener come the porter vnpynnede þe gate, And plyghte in pauci pryueliche and leet þe remenant go rome.” Al for teene of here tixt tremblede myn herte, And in a weer gan ich wexe and with my-selue to dispute Wheþer ich were chose oþer nat chose; on holychurche ich þouhte, That vnderfong me atte fount for on of godes chosene. “For crist clepide ous alle come yf we wolde, Sarrasyns and scismatikes and so he dude þe Iewes, And bad hem souken of hus brest sauete for synne, And drynke bote for bale brouke hit ho so myghte; O uos omnes sitientes, uenite ad aquas! Thenne may alle cristine [come] and cleyme þer to entre By þat blod þat he boughte ous with and baptisme, as he tauhte, Qui crediderit et baptizatus fuerit, [saluus erit,] &amp; cetera. For thauh a crystine man coueytede hus crystendome to reneye, Ryghtfulliche to reneye no reson hit wolde. For may no cherl a chartre make ne hus catel selle With-oute leue of þe lorde no lawe wolde hit graunte. Ac he may renne in arerage and rome fro home, As a recheles caitif oþer reneyed, as hit semeþ; Ac reson shal rekene with hym and rebuke him atte laste, And conscience a-counte with hym and caste him [in] arerages, And putte hym þenne in prison in purgatorie to brenne, Rewardynge him þer for hus rechelesnesse ryght to þe day of dome, Bote contricion and confession crye, by hus lyue, Mercy for hus mysdedes with mouthe and with herte.’ “That is sothe,” seide scripture “may no synne lette Mercy, þat hue nel al amende yf meeknesse here folwe; Thei boþe, as our bookes telleþ aren aboue godes werkes; Misericordia eius super omnia opera eius.” “Ye, baw for bookes!” quaþ on was broken out of helle— “Ich, troianus, a trewe knyght ich take witness of [a] pope, How ich was ded, and dampned to dwellen in helle For an vncristene creature; seynt gregorie wot þe soþe, That al þe cristendome vnder Crist ne myghte cracche me þennes, Bote onliche loue and leaute as in my lawes demynge! Gregore wiste þis wel and wilnede to my soule Sauacion, for þe sothness þat he seih in myn werkes; And for he wilnede wepynge þat ich were saued, God of hus goodnesse seih hus grete wil; With-oute moo bedes byddyng hus bone was vnderfonge, And ich ysaued, as ?e may see with-oute syngynge of masse.

For-thi lerne we lawe of loue as oure lord tauhte; The poure peuple faile [we] nat whil eny peny ous lasteþ. For in here liknesse oure lorde lome hath be knowe; Witnesse in þe paske woke when he ?eode to emaus, Cleophas ne knew hym nat þat he crist were, For hus poure aparail and pilgrimes cloþes, Til þat he blessede here bred and brak hit by-twyne hem. So by hus werkes thei wiste þat he was Iesus, Ac by hus cloþing þei knewe hym nat so caitifliche he ?ede. Al was ensample sothliche to ous synful here, We sholde be lowe and loueliche and leel, eche man to oþer, And pacient as pilgrimes for pilgrimes arn we alle. In þe parail of a pilgrim and in a poure liknesse Holy seyntes hym seih ac neuere in secte of riche.

And wel sykerour he slepeþ þe seg þat is poure, And lasse drat by daye oþer in derk to be robbed, Than he þat ys ryht ryche reson bereþ wittnesse; Pauper ego ludo dum tu diues meditaris.

Abráám for al hus good hadde muche teene, In gret pouerte [he] was yput; a pryns, as hit were, By-nom hym ys housewif and heeld here hym-self, And abráám nat hardy ones to letten hym, Ne for brightnesse of here beaute here spouse to be by-knowe. And for he suffrede and seide nouht our Lord sente tokne, That þe kynge cride to abráám mercy, And deliuerede hym hus wif with muche welthe after. And also Iob þe gentel what ioye hadde he on erthe, How bittere he hit bouhte as þe book telleþ! And for he songe in hus sorwe ‘si bona [accepimus] a domino, Dere-worthe dere God! do we so mala,’ Al hus sorwe to solas þorgh þat songe turnede, And Iob by-cam a iolif man and al hus ioye newe. Lo, how pacience in here pouerte these patriarkes releuede, And brouhte hem al aboue þat in bale rotede. As greyn þat lyth in þe greot and þorgh grace, atte laste, Spryngeþ vp and spredeþ so spedde þe fader abráám, And al-so þe gentel Iob; here ioie hath non ende. Ac leueþ nouht, ?e lewede men þat ich lacke richesse, Thauh ich preise pouerte þus and preoue hit by ensamples Worthiour, as by holy writ and wise philosopheres. Bothe two [beþ] goode be ?e ful certayn, And lyues þat our lorde loueþ and large weyes to heuene. Ac þe poure pacient purgatorye passeþ Raþere þan þe ryche þauh thei renne at ones. For yf a marchaunt and a messager metten to-gederes, And scholde wenden o way where both mosten reste, And rekene byfore reson a resonable acounte, What one haþ, what anoþer haþ and what hy hadde boþe, The marchante mote nede be lette lengere þen þe messagere; For þe parcels of hus paper and oþer pryuey dettes Wol lette hym, as ich leyue the lengthe of a myle. The messager doþ na more bote [with] hus mouth telleþ Hus [erande], and hus [lettere] sheweþ and is a-non delyuered. And thauh þei wende by þe wey tho two to-gederes, Thauh þe messager make hus wey a-mydde þe whete, Wole no wys man wroth be ne hus wed take; Ys non haiwarde yhote hus wed for to take; Necessitas non habet legem. Ac yf þe marchaunt make hus way ouere menne corne, And þe haywarde happe with hym for to mete, Oþer hus hatt oþer hus [hode] oþere elles hus gloues The marchaunt mot for-go oþer moneye of hus porse, And ?ut be lett, as ich leyue for þe lawe askeþ Marchauns for here merchaundise in meny place to tollen. ?ut þauh þei wenden on way as to wynchestre fayre, The marchaunt with hus marchaundise may nat go so swithe As þe messager may ne with so mochel ese. For þat on bereþ bote a boxe a breuet þer-ynne, Ther þe marchaunt ledeþ a male with meny kynne þynges, And dredeþ to be ded þere-fore and he in derke mete With robbours and reuers þat riche men dispoilen; Ther þe messager is ay murye hus mouthe ful of songes, And leyueþ for hus letteres þat no wight wol hym greue. Ac ?ut, myghte þe merchaunt þorgh monye and oþer ?iftes, Haue hors and hardy men; þauh he mette þeoues, Wolde non suche a-sailen hym for hem þat hym folweþ, As safliche passe as the messager and as sone at hus hostil. ?e wyten wel, ?e wyse men what this is to mene, The marchaunt is no more to mene bote men þat ben ryche Aren a-countable to crist and to þe kyng of heuene, That holden mote þe heye weye euene [þe] ten hestes, Boþe louye and lene þe leelle and þe vnleelle, And haue reuthe, and releue with hus grete richesse, By hus power, alle manere men in meschief yfalle; Fynde beggars bred backes for þe colde, Tythen here goodes treweliche a tol, as hit semeþ, That oure lord lokeþ after of eche a lyf þat wynneþ With-oute wyles oþer wrong oþer wommen atte stuwes; And ?ut more, to make pees and quyte menne dettes, Boþe spele and spare to spene vpon þe needful, As crist [him]self comaundeþ to alle cristene peuple, Alter alterius onera portate, [&amp; sic adimplebitis legem christi]. The messagers aren þe mendinans þat lyueþ by menne almesse, Beþ nat ybounde as beþ þe riche to bothe þe two lawes, To lene ne to lere ne lentenes to faste, And oþere pryuey penaunces þe whiche þe preest wot wel That þe lawe ?eueþ leue suche lowe folke to be excused; As, none tythes to tythen ne cloþe þe nakede, Ne in enquestes to come ne contumax, þauh he worche Haly day oþer holy eue hus mete to deserue. For yf he loueþ and by-leyueþ as the lawe techeþ, Qui crediderit &amp; baptizatus fuerit, [saluus erit,] &amp; cetera, Telleþ þe lord a tale as a trewe messager, And sheweþ by seel and sitthe by lettere with what lord he dwelleþ, [Knowelecheþ] hym cristene and of holy [kirke] by-leyue, Ther is no lawe, as ich leyue wol lette hym þe gate, Ther god is gatwarde hym-self and eche a gome knoweth; The porter of pure reuthe may parforme þe lawe, In þat he wilneþ and wolde ech wight as him-self. For þe wil is as muche worth of a wrecche beggere, As al þat þe ryche may reyme and ryghtfulliche dele; And as muche mede for a myte þat he offreþ As þe riche man for al his moneye and more, as by þe godspel; Amen dico uobis, quia hec uidua paupercula [misit plus omnibus qui miserunt in gasophilacium;] So þat poure pacient is parfitest lif of alle, And alle parfite preestes to pouerte sholde drawe; For spera-in-deo spekeþ of prestes þat han no spendyng seluer, That yf þay trauaile treweliche and tristen in god almyghty, Hem sholde neuere lackye lyflode noþer lynnen ne wollene. The title þat ?e takeþ ?oure ordres by telleþ ?e beþ [auaunced,] And needeþ nat to nyme seluer for masses þat ?e syngen; For he þat tok ?ow title sholde take ?ow wages, Oþer þe bisshop þat blessed ?ow and enbaumede ?oure fyngeres. For made neuere kyng knyght bote he hadde catel to spene, As by-fel for a knyght oþer fond hym for hus strengþe; For hit is a carful knyght and of a caitif kynges makynge, That hath no londe ne lynage riche ne good loos of hus hondes. The same ich seye for soþe by suche þat ben preestes, Þat han noþer konnynge ne kyn bote a corone one, And a title, a tale of nouht to hus liflode, as hit were. Vuele ben þei suffred suche þat schenden masses Throgh hure luþer lyuynge and lewede vnder stondyng! A charter is chalangable by-fore a chief Iustice, Yf fals latyn be in [þat lettere] þe lawe hit enpugneþ Oþer peynted par-entrelignarie parcels ouer-skipped; The gome þat so gloseþ chartres a goky he is yholden So is he a goky, by god þat in the godspel failleþ, In masse oþer in matynes maketh eny defaute; Qui offendit in uno, in omnibus est reus. And ouer-skippers al-so in þe sauter seith dauid, Psallite Deo nostro psallite, quia rex terre deus; psallite sapienter. The bishop shal be blamed by-fore god, as ich leyue, Þat coroneþ suche clerkes as for godes knyghtes, Þat conneþ nat sapienter noþer synge ne rede. Ac neyþer is al blameles þe bisshop ne þe chapeleyn; For ignorantia non excusat as ich haue herd in bookes.”— Thus rechelessnesse in a rage a-resonede clergie, And scornede scripture þat meny skyles shewede, Til þat kynde cam clergie to helpen, And in þe myrour of myddel-erde made hym eft to loke, To knowe by ech creature kynde to louye. And ich bowede my body by-holdynge al a-boute, And seih þe sonne and þe see and þe sand after, Wher þat briddes and bestes by here makes ?eden, Wilde wormes in wodes and wonderful foules With fleckede fetheres and of fele colours; Man and hus make ich myghte see boþe, Pouerte and plente bothe pees and werre, Blisse and biter bale bothe ich seih at ones; And how þat men mede token and mercy refuseden. Reson ich seih sothliche suwen alle bestes In etynge, [in] drynkyng in gendrynge of kynde; After cours of concepcion non tok kepe of oþer As when þei hadde ruteyed; a-non þei resten after. Maules drowen hem to maules on morwenynge by hem-self, And femeles to femeles herdeyed and drow. Ther ne was kow ne kow-kynde þat conceyued hadde, That [wolde bere] after bole ne bor after sowe. Ther was no [kynne] kynde þat conceyued hadde, That ne lees þe lykynge of lust of flesch, as hit were, Saue man and hus make; and þer-of me wondrede. For out of reson þei ryde and rechelesliche taken on, As in durne dedes bothe drynkynge and elles. Briddes ich by-helde in bosshes maden nestes, Hadde neuere weye wit to worche þe leste. Ich hadde wonder at wham and wher þat þe pye Lernede legge styckes þat leyen in here neste; Ther is no wryght, as ich wene sholde worche here nest to paye. Yf eny mason þer-to makede a molde With alle here wyse castes wonder me þynkeþ! And ?ut ich meruaillede more menye of þo bryddes Hudden and heleden durneliche here egges, For no foul sholde hem fynde bote hus fere and hym-self. And some treden, ich tok kepe and on trees bredden, And brouhten forth here bryddes al aboue þe grounde. In mareis and in mores in myres and in wateres Dompynges dyueden; “deere god,” ich sayde, “Wher hadden þese wilde suche witt and at what scole?” And whan þe pocok caukede þer-of ich took kepe, How vn-corteisliche þe cok hus kynde forth strenede, And ferliche hadde of hus fairnesse and of hus foule ledene. And siþþe ich loked on þe see and so forþ on þe sterres, Meny selcouth ich seih aren nouht to seggen nouthe; Ne what on floures in feldes and [of] hure faire coloures, How out of greot and of gras grewe so meny huwes, Somme soure and somme swete selcouþ me þouhte; Of here kynde and of here colours to carpen hit were to longe. Ac þat þat [moste] meuede me and my mod chaungede, Was þat ich seih reson suwen alle bestes Saue man and mankynde; meny tymes me þouhte, Reson rewelede hem nat noþer riche ne poure. Then ich aresonede reson and right til hym ich seide, “Ich haue wonder in my witt so wis as þow art holde, Wher-for and why so wide as þow regnest, Þat þow ne ruelest raþer renkes þan oþer beestes. For ich see noone so ofte sorfeten soþliche so mankynde; In mete out of mesure and meny tymes in drynke, In wommen, in wedes and in wordes boþe Thei ouerdon hit day and nyght and so doþ noon oþere. Bestes ruwelen hem al by reson and renkes ful fewe. And þer-fore meruaileþ me for man, as in [makynge,] Is most yliche þe in wit and in werkes, Whi he ne loueþ þy lore and lyueþ as þow techest?” And reson aresonede me and seide, “recche þe neuere Whi ich suffre oþer nat suffre:”— “certes,” ich seide, “Ech a seg for hym-self salamon ous techeþ; De re que te non molestat, noli certare.” “Ho suffreþ more þan God?” quaþ he “no gome, as ich leyue! He myght a-mende in a mynt-while al þat amys stondes; Ac he suffreþ, in ensaumple þat we sholde alle suffren. Ys no vertue so feyr of value ne of profit, As ys suffrance souereynliche so hit be for godes loue. And so witnesseþ þe wyse and wysseþ þe frenshe, Bele vertue est suffraunce mal dire est petite ueniaunce; Bien dire e bien suffrir fait ly suffrable a bien uenir. For-þi,” quaþ reson, “ich rede the rewele þi tonge euere; And er þow lakke eny lyf loke ho is to preise. For is no creature vnder cryst þat can hym-selue make; And yf cristene creatures couthen make hem-selue, Eche lede wolde be lacles leyf þow non oþere! Man was mad of suche matere he may nat wel a-sterte That som tymes hym tit to folwen hus kynde; Caton a-cordeþ her-with nemo sine crimine uiuit.” Tho cauhte ich colour a-non and comsed to be ashamed, And awaked þer-wiþ; wo was me þenne, That ich ne hadde ymet more so murye as ich slepte, And sayde a-non to my-self “slepynge, ich hadde grace To wite what dowel ys ac wakynge neuere!” And þenne was þer a wi?t what he was ich nuste:— “What ys dowel?” quaþ þat wi?t “y-wys, syre,” ich seyde, “To see muche and suffren al certes, syre, ys dowel.” “Haddest þow suffred,” he seide “slepyng þo þow were, Þow sholdest haue knowe þat cleregye can and more conceyued þorwe reson. For reson wolde haue reherced to þe ryght as cleregie seide; Ac for þyn entermetyng her art þow for-sake: Philosophus fuisses, si tacuisses; et alibi: Locutum me aliquando penituit, tacuisse nunquam. Adam, whiles he spak nat hadde paradys at wylle; Ac whanne he mamelede a-boute mete and musede for to knowe The wisdome and þe wit of God he was putte out of blisse. Ryght so ferde reson by þe for þi rude speche, And for þow woldest wyte why of resones pryuete. For pruyde and presompcion of þy parfit lyuynge Reson refusede þe and wolde nat reste with the, Ne cleregie of hus connynge kepeþ þe nat shewe. For shal neuere, er shame come a shrewe wel be chasted; For let a dronken daffe in a diche falle, Let hym lygge, lok nat [on] hym til hym luste aryse; And þauh reson rebuke hym þenne reccheþ he neuere, Of clergie ne of kynde witt counteþ he nat a russhe; To blame hym oþer to bete hym þenne ich halde hit bote synne. Ac when neede nymeþ hym vp a-non he ys a-shamed, And þenne wot he wher-fore and whi he is to blame.” “?e seggeþ soþ, by my soule,” quaþ ich “ich haue seyen hit ofte, [Þer] smyt no þynge so smerte ne smelleþ so foule As shame; þer he sheweþ hym ech man shoneþ hus companye. Whi ?e worden to me þus was for ich aresonede reson.” “?e, certes,” quaþ he, “þat is soþ”— and shop hym to walke, And ich a-roos vp ryght with þat and reuerencede hym fayre, And yf hus wil were he wolde hus name telle? Hic explicit passus quartus de dowel. PASSUS XV. (DO-WEL V.) Incipit passus quintus [de dowel.] “Ich am ymaginatif,” quaþ he “ydel was ich neuere, Þauh [ich sitte] by my-self suche is my grace; Ich haue yfolwed þe in faiþ more þan fourty wynter, And wissede þe ful ofte what dowel was to mene, And counsailede þe for cristes sake no creature to by-gyle, Noþer to lye noþer to lacke ne lere þat is defendid, Ne to spille speche as to speke an ydel, And no tyme to [tyne] ne trewe þyng to teenen; Lowe þe to lyue forth in þe lawe of holychurche; Þenne dost þow wel, with-oute drede ho can do bet, no forse! Clerkes þat connen al ich hope þei conne do bettere; Ac hit suffiseþ to be saued and to be suche as ich tauhte. Ac for to louye and lene and lyue wel and by-leyue, Ys ycallid caritas kynde loue in english; And þat is dobet, yf eny suche be a blessed man, þat helpeþ [Þat] pees be and pacience and poure with-oute defaute; Beatius est dare quam petere. Ac catel and kynde witt encombreþ ful menye; Woo is hym þat hem weldeþ bote he [hem] wel dispeyne; Scientes &amp; non facientes uariis flagellis uapulabunt. Ac comunliche connynge and vnkynde rychesse, As, loreles to be lordes and lewede men techeres, And holy churche horen help auerous and coueytous, Droweþ vp dowel and distruyeþ dobest. Ac grace is a gras þer-fore to don hem eft growe; Ac grace groweþ nat til [goode wil] gynne reyne, And wokie þorwe good werkes wikkede hertes. Ac er suche a wil wexe god hym-self worcheþ, And sent forþ seint espirit to don loue sprynge; Spiritus ubi uult spirat, et cetera. So grace, with-oute grace of god and of good werkes, May nat bee, bee þow siker þauh we bidde euere. Cleregie comeþ bote of siht and kynde witt of sterres, As to be bore oþer bygete in suche constellacion, That wit wexeþ þer-of and oþere [wyrdes] boþe; Uultus huius seculi sunt subiecti uultibus celestibus. So grace is a gyfte of god and kynde witt a chaunce, And cleregye and connyng of kynde wittes techynge. And ?ut is cleregie to comende for cristes loue, more Þan eny connynge of kynde witt bote cleregie hit ruwele. For moyses wittnesseþ þat god wrot in stoon with hus fynger, Lawe of loue oure lorde wrot longe er crist were. And crist cam and confermede and holy [kirke] made And in sond a sygne wrot and seide to þe Iewes, ‘That seeþ hym-self synneles cesse nat, ich hote, To stryke with stoon oþer with staf this strompet to deþe’; Qui uestrum sine peccato est [mittat in eam lapidem,] &amp; cetera. For-thi ich consaile alle cristene cleregie to honoure; For as a man may nat seo þat mysseþ hus eyen, No more can no clerkes bote [if] hit be of bookes. And thauh men maden bokes god was here maister, And seynte spirit þe saumplarie and seide what men sholde wryte. And ryght as syht serueþ a man to see þe hye strete, Ryght so lereþ lettrure lewede men to reson. And as a blynde man in batayle bereþ wepne to fyghte, And haþ non hap wiþ hus axe hus enemy to hitte; No more can a kynde-witted man bote clerkes hym teche, Come for alle hus kynde wyttes þorwe cristendom to be saued; The whiche is cofre of cristes tresour and clerkes kepen þe keyes, To vnlouke hit at here lykynge þe lewede and lerede to helpe, To ?eue mercy for mysdedes yf men wolde hit aske Buxumliche and benygneliche and bydden hit of grace. Archa dei in þe olde lawe leuites hit kepten; Hadde neuere lewede man leue to legge honde [on] þat cheste, Bote hit were preeste oþer preestes sone patriarck oþer prophete. Saul, for he sacrifisede sorwe hym by-tydde, And hus sones for hus synnes sorwe þey hadden; [And alle lewede þat leyde hond þeron loren lyf after.] For-þy ich consaille alle creatures no clerk to dispise, Ne sette short by here science what so þei don hemselue. Take we here wordes a worth for here wittnesses ben trewe, And medle we nat moche with hem to meeuen eny wratthe, Leste cheste chaufe ous so and choppe ech man oþere; And do we as dauid techeþ for doute of godes veniaunce; Nolite tangere cristos meos, &amp;c. For cleregie is cristes vikery to conforte and to curen; Boþe lered and lewed were lost yf cleregie ne were. Kynde-wittede men han a cleregie by hem-selue; Of cloudes and of custumes þei contreuede meny þynges, And markede hit in here manere and mused þer-on to knowe. And of þe selcouþe[s] þat þei seyen here sones þer-of þei tauhte, Þei helden hit for an hey science here soteltes to knowe. Ac þorw here science soþliche was neuere soule ysaued, Ne brouht þorwe here bokes to blisse ne to ioye. For al here kynde knowyng cam bote of diuerse sightes Of briddes and [of] bestes of blisse and of sorwe. Patriarkes and prophetes reprouede here science, And seide here wordes and here wysdomes ne was bote al folye; As to þe cleregie of cryst þei countede hit bote a trufle; Sapientia huius mundi stultitia est apud deum. For þe hye holygost shall heuene to-cleue, And loue shal leepe out after in-to þis lowe erthe, And clannesse shal cacchen hit and clerkes shullen hit fynde; Pastores loquebantur ad inuicem, et cet. Hit spekeþ of riche men ryght nouht ne of riche lordes, Bote of clennesse and of clerkes and kepers of bestes; Ibant magi ab oriente, et cetera. Yf eny frere were founde þere ich ?eue [þe] fyue shyllinges! Noþer in cote noþer in caytyf hous was crist y-bore, Bote in a burgeises hous þe beste of alle þe toune. To pastours and to poetes aperede þe angel, And bad hem go to bedlehem godes burþe to honoure, And [songen] a song of solas Gloria in excelsis deo! Riche men routten þo and in here reste were, Þo hit shon to þe shepehurdes a shewere of blisse. Clerkes knewen the comete and comen with here presentes, And dude here homage honorably to hym þat was almyghty. Whi ich haue ytold þe al þis ich took ful good hede, How þow contrariedest cleregie with crabbede wordes, Þat is, how lewede men and luþere lyghtloker were saued Þan connynge clerkes of kynde vnderstondyng; And þow seidest soþ of somme ac ich seye in what manere. Take two stronge men and in temese cast hem, And boþe naked as a nelde here noþer heuyour þan oþer; That on haþ connynge and can swimmen and dyuen, That oþer is lewede of þat labour and lernede neuere swymme; Which is, trowest þow, of þo two in temese most in drede?” “He þat can nat swymme,” ich seyde “hit semeþ to alle wittes.” “Ryght so,” quaþ þat renke “reson hit sheweþ, That he þat knoweþ cleregie can sonnere a-ryse Out of synne, and be saf þow he synegy ofte, If hym lykeþ and lust þan eny lewede sothliche. For yf þe clerk be connynge and knoweþ what is synne, And hou contricion with-oute confession conforteþ þe soule, As we seen in þe sauter in psalmes on oþer tweye, How contricion is comended for hit caccheþ a-wey synne, Beati quorum remisse sunt iniquitates, [et quorum tecta sunt peccata,] &amp;c.: And þat comforteþ ech [a] clerk and keuereþ fro wanhope, In whiche flood þe feend fondeþ man hardest, Þer þe lewede lyeth stille and lokeþ after lente, And haþ no contricion ar he come to shryfte; And þan can he lytel telle of on oþer of oþer, Bote as his loresman lereþ hym he by-leyueþ and troweþ; And þat is after person oþer pareshe-preest and paraunter boþe beþ lewede For to lere lewede men as luc bereþ wittnesse; Si cecus ducit cecum, ambo in foueam cadent: For muche woo was hym marked þat wade shal with þe lewede. Wel may þe barn blesse þat hym to book sette; That lyuynge after lettrure sauede hym lyf and soule! Dominus pars hereditatis mee ys a murye verset, Hit haþ ytake fro tyborne twenty stronge þeeues; Þer lewede þeeues ben lollid vp loke how þei been sauede! Þe þeef þat hadde grace of god a goode fryday, as þow toldest, Was, for he ?elde hym creaunt to crist and hus grace askede. And god is ay gracious to alle þat gredeþ to hym, He wol no wickede man be lost bote yf he wol hym-self; Nolo mortem peccatoris, sed ut magis conuertatur &amp; uiuat. And þauh þe þeef hadde heuene he hadde non hye blisse As seynt Iohan and oþer seyntes þat han a-serued bettere. Ryght as som man ?yueþ me mete and set me a-mydde þe floor, Ich haue mete more þan ynowe ac nat with so muche worshup As þo þat sytten at þe syd-table oþer with þe souereynes in halle, Bote, as a beggere, bordles by my-self vpon þe grounde. So hit ferde by þe felon þat a goode fryday was saued; He [sit] noþer with seynt Iohan with symon ne with Iude, Ne with maydenes ne with Martris ne with mylde wydewes, Bote as a soleyn by hym-self and serued vp-on þe grounde. For he þat ys ones a þeef is euere more in daunger, And as þe lawe lykeþ to lyue oþer to deye, De peccato propiciato noli esse sine metu; And for to seruen a seynt and suche a þeef to-gederes, Hit were no reson ne ryght to rewarde boþe [y]liche. Ry?t as traianus, þe trewe knyght tulde nat deep in helle, That oure lord ne hadde hym lyghtliche out so leyueþ of þe þeef in heuene. For he ys in the lowest heuene yf oure byleyue beo trewe, And wel loseliche lolleþ þere as by þe lawe of holy-churche; Et [reddet] unicuique secundum opera sua. Ac whi þat [one] þeef vp-on þe croys creaunt hym ?elde Raþer þan þat oþer þauh þou woldest apose, Alle þe clerkes vnder Crist ne couþe þys asoile; Quare placuit, quia uoluit, etc. And so ich seye by þe þat sekest after weyes, How creatures [han] kynde witt and clerkes comen to bokes, And how þe floures in þe fritth comeþ to feyre hewes; Was neuere creature vnder cryst þat knew wel þe bygynnynge Bote kynde, þat contreeuede hit furst of corteise wil. He tauhte þe tortle to trede þe pokok to cauke, And Adam and eue and oþer bestes alle A cantel of kynde witt here kynde to saue. Of good and of wikke kynde was þe ferste, He seih hit and suffrede hit and seide hit bee sholde; Quia ipse dixit, &amp; facta sunt; ipse mandauit, &amp; creata sunt. Ac whi he wolde þat wikkede were ich wene and ich leyue, Was neuere man vpon molde þat myghte hit aspye. Ac longe-lybbynge men lyknede mennes lyuynge To bryddes and to bestes as here bokes telleþ, Þat the fayrest fowel foulest engendreþ, And feblest fowel of flicht is þat [fleeþ] oþere swymmeþ. That is, þe pokok and þe popeiay with here proude federes By-tokneþ ryght riche men þat regnen here on erþe. For porsewe a pocok oþer a pohen to cacche, And haue hem in haste at þyn owene wil; For þei may nat fleo fer ne ful hye noþer, For here feþeres þat faire ben to fle fer hem letteþ. Hus leedene is vnloueliche and lothliche hus caroigne; Ac for hus peyntede [pennes] þe pocok is honoured More þan for hus faire flesch oþer for hus murye note. Ryght so men reuerenceþ more þe ryche for hus muche meeble Þan for þe kyn þat he cam of oþer for hus kynde wittes. Thus þe poete preiseþ þe pocok for hus federes, And þe riche for hus rentes oþere rychesse in hus [schoppe]. Þe larke, þat is a lasse fowel is loueloker of lydene, And swettur of sauour and swyfter of wynge. To lowe-lyuynge men þe larke is resembled, And to leelle and to lyf-holy þat louen alle treuþe. Þus porfirie and plato and poetes menye Lykneþ in here logyk þe leeste fowel oute. And wheþer hij be saf oþer nat saf þe soþe wot nat clergie, Ne of sortes, ne of salamon no scripture can telle Wheþer þei be in helle oþer in heuene; oþere aristotle þe wise. Ac god is so good, ich hope sitthe he gaf hem wittes To wissen ous weyes þer-with þat wenen to be saued, And þe bettere for here bookes— to bidden we been holde Þat God for hus grace gyue here saules reste; For lettred men were but lewede men ?ut ne were þe lore of þo clerkes.” “Alle þese clerkes,” quaþ ich þo “þat on crist byleyuen, Seggen in here sarmons þat noþer sarrasyns ne Iewes With-oute baptisme, as by here bokes beeþ nat ysaued.” “Contra,” quaþ ymaginatif þo and comsed to loure, And seide, “uix saluabitur iustus in die iudicii; Ergo saluabitur,” quaþ he and seide no more latyn. “Traianus was a trewe knyght and took neuere crystendome, And he is saf, seith þe bok and his soule in heuene. Ther is follyng of font and follyng [in] blod-shedynge, And þorw fuyr is follyng and al is ferm by-leyue; Aduenit ignis diuinus, non comburens sed illuminans.

Hic explicit passus quintus de dowel. PASSUS XVI. (DO-WEL VI.) Incipit passus sextus [de dowel]. And ich awakede þer-with wittlees ner hande; As a frek þat feye were forth gan ich walke In manere of a mendinaunt meny ?eres after. And meny tyme of þis meteles muche þouhte ich hadde; Furst, how fortune me failede at my moste neede, And how elde manacede me so myghte happe, Þat, yf ich lyuede longe leue me by-hynde, And vanshie alle myne vertues and myne faire lockes. And how þat freres folweden folk þat was ryche, And peuple þat was poure at lytel prys setten; Ne corses of poure comune in here [kirke]-?erd moste ligge, Bote yf he quike by-quethe hem auht oþer wolde helpe aquite here dettes. And how þis couetise ouer-cam alle kynne sectes, As wel lerede as lewede and lord as þe bonde. And how þat lewede men ben ladde bote oure lord hem helpe, Thorow vnconnynge curatours to incurable peynes. And how [þat] ymaginatif in dremeles me tolde Of kynde and of hus connynge and what connynge he ?af to bestes, How louynge he [is] to eche lyf a londe and a watere; For alle he wisseþ and ?eueþ wit þat walkeþ oþer crepeþ. And ich meruailede in herte how ymagynatif saide, Þat iustus by-fore iesu in die iudicii Non saluabitur bote uix helpe; And, whanne he hadde seide so how sodeynlich he vanshede; And so ich mused vpon þis matere þat me luste to slepe. Thenne cam conscience and cleregie after, And beden me ryse and rome for with reson sholde ich dyne. And ich a-ros and romed forth with reson [we] mette. We reuerencede reson and romed forth softeliche, And mette with a mayster a man ylike a frere. Conscience knew hym wel and welcomede hym fayre; Þei wisshen and wypeden and wenten to þe dyner. Pacience as a poure þyng cam and preide mete for charite, Ylike to peers plouhman as [he] a palmere were, Crauede and criede for cristes loue of heuene, A meles mete for a poure man oþer moneye, yf þei hadden. Conscience knew hym wel and welcomede hem alle; Þei wisshen and wipeden and wenten and setten. Þe maister was made to sitte furst as for þe most worþy; Reson stod and stihlede as for stywarde of halle. Pacience and ich weren yput to be mettes, And seten by ous selue at a syd-table. Cleregie calde after mete and þenne cam scripture, And seruede hem þus sone of sondrie metes menie, Of austyn, [of] ambrosie of alle þe foure euangelies, Edentes et bibentes que apud illos sunt. Ac of þese metes þis maister myghte nat wel chewe; For-þy he eet mete of more cost mortrewes and potages. Of þat þat men myswonne þei maden hem wel at ese, Ac here sauce was ouere-soure and vnsauerliche grounde, In a morter, post-mortem of meny bitere peynes, Bote yf þei synge for þo soules and wepe salte teeres; Uos qui peccata hominum comeditis, nisi pro eis lacrimas effuderitis, ea que in delicijs comeditis, in tormentis [euometis]. Thenne reson radde ryght a-non after, Þat conscience comaunde sholde to do come scripture, And brynge bred for pacience bytynde apartie, And to me þat was hus mette þo and oþer mete boþe. He sette a soure loof and seide, “agite penitentiam,” And sitthe [he] drow ous drynke diu-perseuerans, “As longe,” quaþ he, “as þe lyf and þe licame may dure.” “This is a semeliche seruice!” seide pacience. Thenne cam contrition þat hadde coked for hem alle, And brouhte forþ a pitaunce waspro-hac-orabit-omnis-sanctus-in-tempore-oportuno. Conscience confortede ous boþe cleregie and scripture, And seide, “cor contritum &amp; humiliatum, deus, non despicies.” Pacience was wel apaied of þis propre seruyse, And mad murye with þis mete; ac ich mournede euere, For a doctor at þe heye deys drank wyn faste—. Ue uobis qui potentes estis ad bibendum uinum— And ete meny sondry metes mortrews and poddynges, Braun and blod of þe goos bacon and colhoppes. Then seide ich to my-self þat pacience hit hurde, “?ut is nat þre daies don þat þis doctor prechede At seint paules by-for þe peuple what penaunce þei suffreden, Alle þat coueitede to come to heuene hye ioye; And how þat paul þe apostle what penaunce he þolede For oure lordes loue as holy lettrure telleþ; In fame et frigore, &amp;c. Ac me wondreþ in my witt whi þat thei ne preche, As paul the apostel prechede to þe peuple ofte, Periculum in falsis fratribus! Holy writ bit men be war and wisliche hem kepe, That no fals frere þorw flatrynge hem by-gyle; Ac me is loþ, þow ich latyn knowe to lacky eny secte, For alle we ben brethren þauh we be diuersliche cloþede. Ac ich wiste neuere freek þat frere is ycalled Of þe fyue mendynauns and made eny sarmon, That took þis for [his] teme and told hit with-oute glose. Thei prechen þat penaunce is profitable for þe soule, And what meschief &amp; what mal ese crist for man þolede. Ac this doctor and diuinour and decretistre of canon, And al-so a gnedy gloton with to grete chekes, Hath no pite on vs poure he perfourneþ vuele; Þat he precheþ he proueþ nat” to pacience ich tolde, And wisshede witerliche with a wil ful egre, Þat in the mawe of that maister alle þo metes were, Disches and dobeleres with alle þe deyntes after! “Ich shal Iangly to þys Iordan with hus Iuste wombe, And a-pose hym [what] penaunce is and purgatorie on erthe, And whi he lyueþ nat as he lereþ!” “let be,” quaþ pacience, And seide, “þow shalt seo þus sone whan he may na more, He shal haue a penaunce in hus paunche and puffe at eche worde; Thenne shulleþ his gottes godelen and [he] bygynne to galpe. Now he hath dronke so depe he wol deuiny sone, And preouen it by here apocalips and by þe passion of seint aueray, Þat noþer bacon ne braun blammanger ne mortreuus Ys noþer fissh ne flessh bote fode for penauntes; And take witnesse of þe trinite and take his felawe to wittnesse, What he fond in a forel of a freres lyuynge; And bote þe ferste leef be lesynge leyf me neuere after! And þenne is tyme to talke and to apose this doctour Of dowel and of dobet and yf dobet do eny penaunce.” Ich sat stille as pacience wolde and thus sone þis doctour, As rody as a rose roddede hus chekes, Kowede and carpede and conscience hym herde, And tolde of a trinite and to-warde me he lokede— “What is dowel, sire doctour?” quaþ ich “is dobet eny penaunce?” “Dowel?” quaþ þis doctour and he drank after, “Do þy neyhebore non harme ne [þy]-selue noþer, Þanne dost þow wel and wisliche ich dar hit wel a-vouwe.” “Certes, sire,” þanne seide ich “hit semeþ nat here, In þat ?e parteþ nat with ous poure þat ?e passeþ dowel, Noþer louyeþ as ?e lereþ as oure lorde wolde, Et uisitavit &amp; fecit redemptionem plebis sue israel. And ?e fare þus with ?oure sike freres ferly me þynkeþ, Bote dowel endite ?ow in die iudicii.” Thenne conscience ful curteisliche a contenaunce he made, And preynte vpon pacience to preye me be stille, And seide hym-self, “syre doctour by so hit be ?oure wil, What is dowel and dobet? ?e diuynours knoweþ.” “Ich haue seide,” seide þe seg “y can seye no bettere, Bote do as doctours telleþ for dowel ich hit holde; Þat traueileþ to teche oþere for dobet ich it holde; And he þat doþ as he techeþ ich halde hit for a dobest; Qui facit et docuerit, magnus uocabitur.” “Now þow, cleregie,” quaþ conscience “carpe what is dowel.” “Haue [me] excused,” quaþ cleregie “by crist, bote in scole, Shal no such motif be meued for me, bote þere, For peers loue þe plouhman þat enpugnede ones Alle kyne konnynges and alle kyne craftes, Saue loue and leaute and louhnesse of herte, And no tixt takeþ to preoue þis for trewe Bote dilige deum &amp; proximum and Domine, quis habitabit in tabernaculo, &amp;c.; And preoueþ by pure skyle inparfit alle þynges, Nemo bonus, Bote leel loue and treuthe þat loþ is to be yfounde.” Quaþ peers þe plouhman “pacientes uincunt. By-for perpetual pees ich shal preoue þat ich seide, And a-vowe by-for God and for-sake hit neuere, That disce, doce, dilige deum and thyn enemye; Hertely þou hym helpe emforth þy my?t, Cast [hote] coles on hus hefde of alle kynde speche, Fonde þorgh wit and with worde hus loue for to wynne, And ?if hym eft and eft euere at hus neede; Conforte hym with þy catel and with þy kynde speche, And leye on hym þus with loue tyl he lauhe on þe; And bote [he] bowe for þis betynge blynd mote [he] worthe!” And whanne he hadde worded þus wiste no man after, Where peers plouhman by-cam so priueliche he wente. And reson ran after [and] ryght with him ?eode; Saue conscience and cleregie ich couþe no mo aspye. And pacience propreliche spak tho peers was thus passed, “That loueþ lelly,” quaþ he “bote lytel þyng coueyteþ. Ich wolde, and ich wil hadde wynnen al Fraunce With-oute bruting of burnes oþer eny blod-sheding; Ich take wittnesse,” quaþ he “at holy writ a partie; Pacientes uincunt. For, by hym þat me made! my?te neuere pouerte, Miseise, ne myschief ne man with hus tonge Tene þe eny tyme and þow take pacience, And bere hit in þy bosom abowte wher þou wendest, [In þe corner of a cart-whel wiþ a crowe croune.] Shal neuere burne be abaisshed þat hath þis a-boute, Neiþer hete ne hail ne helle pouke hym greue, Neiþer fuyr, noþer flod ne be a-fered of enemye; Caritas expellit omnem timorem; Ther nis wyght in þis worlde þat wolde þe lette To haue alle londes at þy lykyng &amp; þe here lord make, And Maister of alle here meeble and of here moneye after, The kynge and alle þe comune and cleregie to þe aloute As for here lorde and ledere and lyuen as þou techest.” “This is a [dido,]” quaþ þis doctour “a disours tale! Al þe witt of þis worlde ne wyghte mennes strengthe Can nat performen a pees of þe pope and of hus enemys Profitable for boþe parties”— and put þe bord fram hym, And tok conscience and cleregie to counsel, as hit were. Ac ich took kepe how conscience [congede] sone þis doctour, And sitthe he seide to cleregie so þat ich hit herde, “By cryst,” quaþ conscience “cleregie, ich wol nat lye, Me were leuere, by oure lorde and ich lyuye sholde, Haue pacience parfitliche þan half þy pack of bokes! Lettrure and longe studie letteþ ful menye, That thei knoweþ nat,” quaþ Conscience “what is kynde pacience. For-thi,” quaþ conscience “christ ich þe by-teche, With pacience wol ich passe parfitnesse to fynde.” Thus þei wente forþ here way with gret wil ich folewede. Thenne hadde pacience, as pilgrimes hauen in here poke vitailes, Sobrete and symple-speche and soþfast-by-leyue, To comforty hym and conscience yf þei come in place Ther vnkyndnesse and couetyse ys hongry contreis boþe. And as þei wente by þe wey of dowel gan þei carpe; Thei mette with a mynstral as me þo þouhte. Pacience a-posed hym and preide he sholde telle What craft þat he couþe and cortesly he seide, “Ich am a Mynstral,” quaþ þis man “my name is activa uita, Peers prentys þe plouhman alle peuple to comfortye.” “What manere mynstralcie my dere frend,” quaþ conscience, “Hast þow vsed oþer haunted al þy lyf-tyme?” “Mynstralcie can ich nat muche bote make men murye, As a waffrer with waffres and welcome godes gistes. Of my labour þei lauhe þe lasse and þe more. The poure and þe riche y plese and payn fynde, And fewe robis ich fonge oþer forrede gounes. Wolde ich lye and do men lauhe þenne lacchen ich sholde Mantels oþer moneye a-mong lordes Minstrales. Ich can nat tabre ne trompe ne telle faire gestes, Farten, ne fiþelen at festes, ne harpen, Iapen ne Iogelen ne gentelliche pipe, Noþer sailen ne sautrien ne singe with þe giterne. Ich haue none gode gyftes of these grete lordes For no bred þat ich by-trauaile to bryng by-fore lordes. Ne were hit þat þe parishe prayeþ for me on sonedayes, Ich am sory þat ich sew oþer sette bote for my-self one. Ac þe prest and oþer peuple prayeþ for peers plouhman, And for me, actyf, hus man þat ydelnesse hate. For lordes and lorelles luthere and goode, Fro myhel-masse to myhel-masse ich fynde mete and drynke. Ich fynde payn for þe pope and praye hym ich wolde Þat pestilences to pees and to parfit loue turne. For founde ich þat hus blessing and hus bulle myghte Letten þis luþer eir and lechen þe syke— As þe booke bereþ wittnesse þat he bere myghte In hus mouth mercy and amende vs alle, Super egros manus imponent, &amp; bene se habebunt— Thenne wolde ich bee busy and buxum to helpe Eche kynne creature þat on cryst by-leyueþ. For sutthe he haþ the power þat seynt peter hadde, He haþ pureliche þe pot with þe same salue; Argentum &amp; aurum non est michi; quod autem habeo, hoc tibi do, &amp;c. Ac yf myghte of miracle hym faile hit is for men beeþ nat worthi For to haue þe grace of god and no gult in þe pope. For may no blessynge do vs bote bote yf we wol amende, Ne mannes preier make pees among cristine peuple, Til prude be pureliche for-do and þat þorw payn defaute; Ex habundantia panis et uini turpissimum peccatum aduenit. Pure plente of payn þe peuple of Sodomye, And reste and riche metes rybaudes hem made.” “Pees!” quaþ pacience “ich praye þe, syre actyf! For þauh neuere payn ne plouh ne potage were, Prude wolde putte hym-self forþ þauh no plouh erye. Hit am ich þat fynde alle folke and fram hunger saue, Thorgh þe heye helpe of hym þat me hyder sente, And seide, ‘lo, here lyf-lode ynowe’ yf oure by-leyue be trewe. For lent was þer neuere lyf bote lyflode were yshape, Wher-of oþere wherfore and wher-with to lyuen; The worme þat woneþ vnder erthe and in water fisshes, The crykett by kynde of fur and corlew by the wynde, Bestes by gras &amp; by greyn and by grene rotes. In menynge þat alle men myghte þe same Lyuen þorgh leell by-leyue as oure lord wittnesseþ, Quodcunque petieritis patrem in nomine meo, dabitur enim uobis; &amp; alibi: Non in solo pane uiuit homo, sed de omni uerbo, quod procedit de ore dei.” “Hast þow ay,” quaþ actyf “suche mete with þe?” “?e,” quaþ Pacience, and hente out of hus poke A pece of þe pater-noster and profrede to vs alle. And ich lustnede, and lokede what lyflode hit were; Þanne was hit fiat-uoluntas-tua þat sholde fynde vs alle. “Haue, actyf,” quaþ pacience “and eet this when þe hungreþ, Oþer whenne þow clomsest for colde oþer clyngest for drouthe; And shal neuere gyues þe greue ne grete lordes wratthe, Pryson ne oþer payne for—pacientes uincunt; By so þow be sobre of syght, and of tounge boþe, In ondyng, in handlyng in alle þy fyue wittes, That þow care for no corn for cloþ ne for drynke, Ne deþ drede, ne deuel deye as god lykeþ, Wheþer þorw hunger oþer þorw hete at hus wil be hit! For yf þow lyuest after hus lore þe shorter lyf þe betere; Si quis amat christum mundum non diligit istum, [Sed quasi fetorem spernes illius amorem.] Þorgh hus breþ bestes woxen and a-brode ?eden; Dixit &amp; facta sunt. Ergo þorw hus [breþ] bestes lyuen boþe men and fisshes, As wytnesseþ holy wryte when we seyn oure graces, Aperis tu manum tuam, &amp; imples omne animal benedictione. Hit is founde þat fourty wynter folke leueden and nouht tylede, And out of flent sprange [þe] flod þat folke and bestes dronken. And in elyes time heuene was yclosed, That no reyne reynede þus redeþ men in bookes, That menye wynter men lyueden and of no mete telden.

And yf men lyueden as mesure wolde sholde neuere be defaute Among crysten creatures yf crystes worde be trewe; Dabo tibi secundum peticionem tuam.” “What is parfit pacience?” quaþ Activa uita. “Meeknesse and Mylde speche and men of on wil, Þe whiche wil loue ledeþ to oure lordes place; And þat is charite, chaumpion chief of alle vertues, And þat is poure pacient alle perilis to suffre.” “Where pouerte and pacience plese more god almyghty Than do ryghtful richesse and resonably to spende?” “?e, quis est ille?” quaþ pacience “quyk laudabimus eum! Thauh men rede of riche ryght to þe worldes ende, [I wist neuere renke þat riche was þat whan he rekne sholde,] And whan he drouh hym to þe deþ þat he ne dradde hym sarrer Than eny poure pacient and þat preoue ich by reyson.

Hic explicit passus sextus de Dowel. PASSUS XVII. (DO-WEL VII.) Incipit passus septimus. Alas! þat [richesse] shal reue and robbe mannes soule [Fro] þe loue of oure lorde at hus laste ende! Thei þat haue hure hyre by-fore aren eueremore poure, And shulle nat deye out of dette to dyne er they deseruen hit. When here deuer is don and his daies iourne, Þen may men wite what he is worþ and what he haþ deserued; And nouht to fonge by-fore for drede of disalouwynge. So ich say by ?ow riche hit semeþ nat ?e shulle Haue two heuenes for ?oure her-beynge. Muche myrthe is in may a-monge wilde bestes, And so forth whil somer lasteþ heore solace dureþ; And muche myrthe a-monge riche men is þat han meoble ynow and heele. [Ac] beggers a-boute myd-somere bredlees þei soupe, And ?ut is wynter for hem wors for wet-shood þei gangen, A-furst and a-fyngred and foule rebuked Of þese worlde-riche men þat reuthe hit is to huyre. Now, lord, send hem somer som-tyme to solace and to ioye, That al here lyf leden in lowenesse and in pouerte! For alle myghtest þow haue maked men of grete welþe, And liche witty and wys and lyue with-oute neode; Ac for þe beste, [as] ich hope aren somme poure and some riche. Ryght so haue reuthe of ous alle þat on þe rode deydest, And amende ous of thy mercy and make ous alle meeke, Louh and leel and louynge and of herte poure; And send ous contricion to clanse with oure soules, And confession, to culle alle kynne synnes, And satisfaccion, the whiche fulfulleþ þe fadres will of heuene. And these been dowel and dobet and dobest of alle; Cordis contricio comeþ of sorwe in herte, And oris confessio þat comeþ of shrifte of mouthe, And operis satisfactio þat for synnes payeth, And for alle synnes soueraynliche quiteþ. Cordis contricio, oris confessio, operis satisfactio; These thre with-outen doute tholen alle pouerte, And lereþ lewed and lered heh and louh to knowe, Ho þat doþ wel oþer bet oþer best a-bouen alle; And holichurche and charite here-of a Chartere maden. Bote þese þre þat ich spak of on domes day [vs] defenden, Elles is in ydel al oure lyuynge here, Oure preyers and oure penaunce and pilgrymages to rome. Bote oure spences and spending sprynge of a trewe wille, Elles is al oure labour lost; lo, how men wryten In fenestres at þe freres yf fals be þe foundement! For-thi cristene men scholde been in comun riche no couetise to hym-selue. For seuene synnes þat þer been þat assailen ous euere, The fende folweth hem alle and fondeþ hem to helpe, And with richesse tho ribaudes rathest men by-gylen; For þer þat rychesse regneþ reuerences foleweth, And þat is plesaunt to pruyde in poure and in riche. The ryche [is] yreuerenced by reson of his richesse, There þe poure is yput by-hynde and can parauntre more Of wit and of wysedome þat fer wey is bettere Than richesse oþer reaulte and raþer yhurde in heuene. For þe ryche haþ muche to rekene and ry?t softe walkiþ The heye wey to-heuene-warde; he halt hit nat ful euene; There þe poure presseþ by-fore with a pak at hus rygge, Opera enim illorum seq[u]untur illos. Batauntlyche, as beggers don and boldeliche he craueþ, For hus pouerte and pacience perpetuel ioye. Also pruyde in richesse regneþ raþer þan in pouerte; Oþer in þe maister oþer in þe man som mancion he shewith. Ac in pouerte þer pacience is pruyde hath no my?te, Ne non of the seuene synnes sitte [ne may] þer longe, Ne haue power in pouerte yf pacience hit folewe. For þe poure is ay prest to plese þe riche, And buxume at his biddyng for hus breed and drynke; And buxumnesse and bost aren euere-more at wratthe, And ayther hateþ oþer and mowen nat dwelle togederes. Yf wratthe wraxle with þe poure he hath þe worsse ende; For yf þei boþe [pleyne] þe poure is bote fyble, And yf he chide oþer chatere hym chyuyþ þe worsse. For loueliche he lokyþ and louh is hus speche, That mete oþer moneye of straunge men mote begge. And yf glotenye greue pouerte he gadereþ þe lasse, For hus rentes wol nat reche ryche metes to bigge; Þauh hus glotenye be of good ale he goþ to a cold beddyng, And hus heued vn-heled vneisyliche ywrye; For when he streyneþ hym to strecche þe straw is hus whitel; So for hus glotonye and grete synne he haþ a greuous penaunce, That is weylawey whan he awakeþ and wepeþ for colde; So is he neuere more ful murye so meschief hym folweþ. Þaugh couetyce wolde with þe poure wraxle þei mai nat come to-gederis, By þe necke nameliche her neiþer may henten oþer. For men knoweþ þat couetise is of ful kene wil, And haþ hondes and armes of a long lengthe, And pouerte is a pety þyng apereþ nat to hus nauele; A loueliche laik was hit neuere by-twyne a long and a short. Thauh auarice wolde angrye pouerte he hath bote lytel my?te; For pouerte haþ bote pokes to putten yn hus goodes, Ther auarice haþ almaries and yre-bounden cofres. And wheþer be betere to breke lasse boost hit makeþ, To breke a beggers bagge þan an yre-bounden cofre? Lecherye loueth none poure for he hath bote lytel seluer, Ne doþ men dyne dylicatliche neyþer drynk wyne ofte. A straw for þe stywes! hy stod nat ful longe And þay hadde non oþer haunt bote of poure peple! Thauh slewþe suwe pouerte and serue nat god to paye, Meschief is ay a mene and makeþ hym to þenke, That [god is] hus grettest help and no gome elles, And he is seruaunt al-way, he seith and of hus secte boþe. And wheþer he be oþer be nat he beriþ þe sygne of pouerte, And in þat secte oure sauyour sauede al mankynde. For-thi alle poure þat pacient is of pure ryght may cleyme After here endyng heere heuene-riche blysse. Much hardyloker may he aske þat her may haue hus will In londe and in lordshepes and lykynge of body, And for goddes loue leueþ al and lyueþ as a beggere. As a mayde for a mannes loue here moder for-sakeþ, Hure fader and hure frendes and gooþ forth with hure paramour; Muche is suche a mayde to loue [of a man þat suche on takeþ] More þan þat maide is þat is ymaried by brocage, As by asent of sondry bodyes and seluer to bote, More for couetice of catel þan kynde loue of þe mariage. So hit farith by ech a persone þat possession forsakeþ, And putteþ hym to be pacient and to pouerte hym weddeþ, Þe whyche is sibbe to cryst self and semblable boþe.” Quath Actyf þo al angryliche and argueynge as hit were, “What is pouerte pacient?” quaþ he “ich praye þat þou telle hit.” “Paupertas,” quaþ pacience “est odibile bonum, Remocio curarum, Possessio sine calumpnia, donum dei, sanitatis mater; Absque solicitudine semita, sapiencie temperatrix, negocium sine dampno; Incerta fortuna, absque solicitudine felicitas.” “Ich can nat construen al this” quath activa uita. “Parfay,” quath pacience “propreliche to telle In english, hit is ful harde ac somdel ich shal telle þe. DISTINCTIO PAUPERTATIS. Pouerte is þe firste poynte þat prude most hateþ; ‘Thanne is pouerte good,’ quaþ good skyle ‘þauh hit greue a lytel, Al þat may putten of pruyde in place þer he regneþ.’ Remocio curarum:— For selde sitt pouerte þe sothe to declare; As a Iustice to Iuge men men enioyneþ þer-to no poure, Ne to be a mayre ouere men ne Mynistre vnder kynges. Selde is þe poure [yput] to punysshe eny peuple, Ergo pouerte and poure men parfournen þe comaundement, Nolite iudicare quemquam. Possessio sine calumpnia:— Selde is þe poure ryght riche bote of hus [ri?tful] heritage, He wynneþ nat with wyghtes fals ne with vnseled mesures, Ne borweþ of his neyghebore bote þat he may wel paye, And lyghtly men leneþ to fewe men and men [wene] hym poure. The feorthe is a fortune þat florisshiþ þe soule With sobrete [from] alle synnes and al-so ?ut more; Hit defendeth þe flessh fro folyes ful menye: And a collateral confort crystes owen sonde; Donum dei. ?ut hit is moder of my?t and of mannes helthe, And Frende in alle fondynges and of foule vueles leche; Sanitatis mater. The syxte, hit is a paþ of pees ?e, þorw þe pas of [altoun] Pouerte myghte passe with-oute peril of robbynge. For þer as pouerte passeþ pees folweþ commenliche, And euere þe lasse þat eny lyf ledeþ the lyghter hus herte is þere, As he þat wot neuere with wham in [nyghtes] to mete; Paupertas est sine solicitudine semita: Seneca. The seueþe, hit is a welle of wysedome and fewe wordes sheweþ, For lordes aloweþ hym lytel oþer leyth ere to hus reisone; He tempreþ hus tonge to-treuthe-ward þat no tresour coueyteþ; Sapiencie temperatrix. The eyhteþe, hit is a leel labour and loþ to take more Than he may sothliche deserue in somer oþer in wynter; And þauh he chaffare, he chargeþ no los mowe he charite wynne; Negocium sine dampno. Þe nyethe, hit is swete to soules [is] no suger swettere; For pacience is hus paneter and payn to pouerte fyndeth, And sobrete ?eueþ here swete drynke and solaceþ here in alle angres. Thus leryde me a lerede man for oure lordes loue, seint austyn, That pure pouerte and pacience was a louh lyuynge in erthe, A blessid lyf with-oute busynesse bote oneliche for þe soule; Absque solicitudine felicitas. Now god þat al þynge gyueþ graunte hus saule reste, That wrot þis to wisse men what pouerte was to mene!” Thenne hadde actyf a ledere þat heyhte liberum arbitrium, That knewe conscience ful wel and clergie boþe; “He þat haþ londe and lordshep,” quaþ he “at the laste ende Shal be pourest of power at hus partyng hennes.” Thenne ich wondrede what he was this Liberum Arbitrium, And prayede pacience þat ich a-pose hym moste. And [he] suffrede me and seide “assay hus oþer name.” “Leue liberum arbitrium,” quaþ ich “of what londe ar ye? ?if þow be cristes creature for cristes loue, tel me.” “Ich am cristes creature,” quaþ he “and cristine in menye place, And in cristes court yknowe and of hus kynne a partye; Is noþer peter þe porter ne paul with his fauchon, That wolde defende me heuene dore dynge ich neuere so late. At myd-ny?t, at mydday my uoise is so yknowe, Þat eche creature þat loueþ criste welcomeþ me faire.” “Wher-of serue ?e?” ich seide “syre liberum arbitrium?” “Of som tyme to fyghte,” quaþ he “falsnesse to destruye, And som tyme to suffre boþe sorwe and teene, Layke oþer leue at my lykynge chese, To do wel oþer wikke a wil with a reyson, And may nat be with-oute a body to bere me wher hym lykeþ.” “Thenne is þat body bettere þan þow,” quaþ ich “nay,” quaþ he, “no betere; Bote as a wode were a fure þenne worchen [þei] boþe, And ayþer is oþeres heete and also of a wil; And so is man þat haþ hus mynde myd liberum arbitrium. And þe whyle ich quyke þe cors cald am ich anima; And whenne ich wilne oþer wolde animus ich hyhte, And for þat ich can and knowe cald ich am ‘mannys þouht;’ And whan ich make mone to god memoria ich hatte; And when ich deme domes and do as treuthe techeþ, Then is racio my ryhte name ‘reson’ in englissh; And whenne ich fele þat folke telleþ my furste name is sensus, And þat is witte and wisedome the welle of alle craftes; And when ich chalange oþer nat chalange chepe oþer refuse, Þanne am ich conscientia cald godes clerk and hus notarie; And when ich wol do oþer nat do goode dedes oþer ille, Then am ich liberum arbitrium as lettrede men tellen; And when ich loue leelly oure lord and alle oþere, Then is ‘leel loue’ my name in latyn þat is amor; And when ich flee fro þe body and feye leue þe caroygne, Then am ich a spirit specheles and spiritus þenne ich hote. Austyn and ysidorus ayþer of hem bothe Nempnede me þis to name þow now myght cheese How þow coueitest to calle me now knowest þow alle myne names. Anima pro diuersis actionibus diuersa nomina sortitur; dum uiuificat corpus, anima est. dum uult, animus est; dum recolit, memoria est; dum iudicat, racio est; dum sentit, sensus est; dum amat, amor est; dum declinat a malo ad bonum, liberum arbitrium est; dum negat uel consentit, consciencia est; dum spirat, spiritus est.” “?e ben as a bischop,” quaþ ich al bordynge þat tyme, “For bischopes blessed thei bereþ meny names, Presul and pontifex and metropolitanus, And oþer names an hepe episcopus and pastor.” “That is soth,” he seide “now ich seo þy wil How þow woldest know and conne þe cause of alle here names, And of myne, yf þow myghtest me þynkeþ by þy speche!” “?e, syre,” ich seyde, “by so þat no man were a-greued, Alle þe science vnder sonne and alle sotile craftes Ich wolde ich knewe and couthe kyndeliche in myn herte.” “Thanne art þow inparfyt,” quaþ he “and on of prydes knyghtes; For suche a luste and lykynge lucifer fel fro heuene; Ponam pedem meum in aquilone, &amp; ero similis altissimo. Hit were a-geyn kynde,” quaþ he “and alle kynne resoun That eny creature sholde conne al excepte cryst one. A?ene alle suche salamon spekeþ and dispiseþ here wittes, And seith, sicut qui mel comedit multum, non ei bonum est: Sic qui scrutator est magestatis, opprimatur a gloria. To englissh-men this is to [mene] þat mowen speke and huyre, The man þat muche hony eet his mawe hit engleymeþ: The wyttiour that eny wight is bote yf he worche þer-after, The biterour he shal a-bygge bote yf he [wel] worche; Beatus, seith seynt bernard qui scripturas legit, Et uerba uertit in opera emforth his power. Couetise to conne and to knowe science[s] Putte oute of paradys adam and eue; Sciencie appetitus hominem immortalitatis [gloria] spoliauit.

Loo, what holy wryt wyttnesseþ of wikked techeres; As holyness and honeste out of holy churche Spryngeþ and spredeþ and enspireþ þe peuple Þorgh parfit preest-hood and prelates of holichurche, Ryght so out of holychurche al vuel spredeþ, Ther inparfit preest-hod is prechours and techours. And seo hit by ensample of trees in somer tyme, Ther somme bowes bereþ leues and somme bereþ none; The bowes þat bereþ nat and beeþ nat grene-leuede, Ther is a myschif in þe more of suche manere stockes. Ryght so persones and preestes and prechers of holy churche Ys þe rote of [þe] ryght feithe to reuwele þe peuple; Ac þer þe rote is roten reson wot þe sothe, Shal neuere floure ne frut wexe ne fair leef be grene. For wolde [?e] letteride leue the lecherie of cloþinge, And be courteis and kynde of holy[kirke] goodes, Parte [with the] poure and ?oure pruyde leue, And þerto trewe of ?oure tonge and of ?oure tail also, And haten harlotrie [and] to vnderfonge þe tyþes Of vserers and of hores and of al vuel wynnynges, Loth were lewede men bote þei ?oure lore folweden, And a-menden hem of here mysdedes more for ?oure ensamples Þan for to preche and preuen hit nat; ypocrisie hit semeþ! Ypocrisie is a braunche of pruyde and most among clerkes, And [is] ylikned in latyn to a lothliche dounghep, That were by-snywe al with snow and snakes with-ynne, [Or to a wal whit-lymed &amp; were blak with-inne.] Ry?t so meny preestes prechours and prelates, Þat beþ enblaunched with bele paroles and with bele cloþes; And as lambes þei loken and lyuen as wolues. Iohannes crisostomus karpeþ þus of clerkes, Sicut de templo omne bonum progreditur, sic de templo omne malum procedit. Si sacerdocium integrum fuerit, tota floret ecclesia; si autem corruptum fuerit, omnium fides marcida est. Si sacerdocium fuerit in peccatis, totus populus conuertitur ad peccandum. Sicut cum uideris arborem pallidam &amp; marcidam, intelligis quod uicium habet in radice, Ita cum uideris populum indisciplinatum &amp; irreligiosum, sine dubio sacerdocium eius non est sanum. Alas! lewede men muche leese ?e þat fynden Vnkynde creatures to beo kepers of ?oure soules! Ac þyng þat wikkedliche is wonne and with false sleithes, Wolde neuere oþer-wise god bote wicked men hit hadde, As imparfit preestes and prechers after seluer, Secutours and sodenes somners and here lemmannes; And þat with gyle was gete vngraciousliche be dispended. Curatours of holychurche and clerkus þat ben auarous, Lightliche þat þei leue loseles hit deuouren. Leyueþ hit wel, lordes boþe lered and lewede, Þat þus goþ here godes atte laste ende, [Þat] lyuen a-?ens holy lore and þe loue of charite.” “Charite,” quaþ ich þo “þat is a þing for sothe That maistres comenden muche; wher may hit be founde? Ich haue lyued in [london] meny longe ?eres, And founde ich neuere in faith as freres hit precheþ, Charite, þat chargeþ nat ne chit, þauh men greue hym, As paul in a pistele of hym bereþ witnesse; Non inflatur, non est ambiciosa, non querit que sua sunt. Ich [knew] neuere, by cryst clerk noþer lewede, That he ne askede after hus and oþer-whyle coueytede Thyng þat needede hym nat and nyme hit, yf he myghte! [For þo? men so?t al sectes of sustren &amp; of breþeren,] And [þow] fynde hym, bote figuratifliche a ferly me þynkeþ; Hic in enigmate, tunc facie ad faciem:— And so ich trowe trewely by that men tellen of charite.” “Charite is a childish thing as holichurche wittnesseþ, Nisi efficiamini sicut paruuli, [non intrabitis in regnum celorum:] [DISTINCTIO CARITATIS.] As proud of a peny as of a pounde of golde, And al-so glad of a goune of a grey russet As of a cote of cammoka oþer of clene scarlett. He is glad with alle glade as gurles þat lauhen alle, And sory when he seeþ men sory as þow seest children Lauhen þer men lauhen an loure þer men loureþ. And when a man swereþ for soþ for soþ he hit troweþ; He weneþ [þat] no wi?t wold lyghe and swere, Ne þat eny gome wolde gylen oþer, ne greue, For drede of god þat is so good and þus-[gates] ous techeþ, Quodcunque uultis ut uobis faciant homines, facite eis. He hath no lykynge to lauhe ne lyghe, men to scorne; Alle siknesses and sorwes for solas he [hem] takeþ, And alle manere meschifs as minstracie of heuene. Of deþ ne of derþe drad was he neuere, Ne mysliked, þauh he loore oþer lenede to þat ilke Þat neuere payed peny a?e in place þere he borwede.” “Who fyndeþ hym his fode?” quaþ ich “oþer what frendes hath he, Rentes oþer richesses to releue hym at hus neode?” “Of rentes ne of richesses,” quaþ he “reccheþ he neuere, [A frend he haþ þat fynt him þat faileþ him neuere]. On aperis-tu-manum alle þynge hym fyndeþ; Fiat-uoluntas-tua festeþ hym eche day. And also he can clergie credo-in-deum-patrem And portreieþ [wel] þe pater-noster and peynteþ hit with auees. And oþer-while hus wone is to wende in pilgrymages, Ther poure men and prysouns beþ and payeþ for here lyflode, Clotheþ hem and comforteþ hem and of crist precheþ hem, What sorwes he suffrede in ensample of ous alle, That pouerte and pacience parfitliche ytake Ys muche merit to þat man þat wel may suffren. Whan he haþ thus visited fetered folke and oþer folke poure, Then he ?erneþ in-to þouht and ?epliche he secheþ Pruyde, with alle þe portinaunce and packeþ hem togederes, And laueþ hem in þe lauandrie laboraui-in-gemitu-meo, And boukeþ hem at hus brest and beteþ hit ofte, And with warme water of hus eyen wokeþ hit [til hit] white; Lauabis me, et super niuem dealbabor. Þanne syngeþ he whanne he so doþ and som tyme wepynge, Cor contritum &amp; humiliatum, deus, non despicies.” “Were ich with hym, by crist,” quaþ ich “ich wolde neuere fro hym, Þauh ich my by-lyue sholde begge a-boute at menne hacches. Wher clerkus knowe hym nat,” quaþ ich “þat kepen holychurche?” “Peers the plouman,” quaþ he “most parfitliche hym knoweþ; Et uidit deus cogitationes eorum. By cloþynge ne by karpinge knowe shalt thou hym neuere, Ac þorw werkes þou myght wite wher forþ he walkeþ; Operibus credite. He is þe muriest of mouthe at metes þer he sitteþ, And compenable in companye as crist hym-self techeþ, Nolite tristes fieri, sicut ypocrite. Ich haue seyen hym my-self som tyme in russett, Bothe in greye and in greys and in gylt harneys, And al-so gladliche he gyueþ to gomes þat hit needeþ. Eadmund and edward ayþer were seyntes, And chief charite with hem and chast al here lyue. Ich haue seyen charite al-so syngen and rede, Ryden, and rennen in raggede cloþes, Ac biddyng as a beggere by-heold ich hym neuere. Ac in riche robes raþest he walketh, Y-called and ycrymyled and hus croune shaue. And in [a] freres frocke he was yfounde ones, Ac it is fer and fele ?eres in fraunceys tyme; In that secte sitthe to selde he haþ be founde. Riche men he comendeþ and of here robes takeþ, Of þo þat leelliche lyuen and louen and by-leyuen; Beatus est diues sine macula. In kynges court he comeþ yf hus counsail be trewe; Ac yf couetise be of hus counsail he wol nat come þer-ynne. Among þe comunes in court he comeþ but selde, For brawelynge and bacbytynge and beryng of false wittnesse. In constorie by-fore þe comissarie he comeþ nat ful ofte, For here lawe is ouere-longe bote yf þei lacche seluer. With bisshopes he wolde beo for beggers sake, Ac auarice oþer-whiles halt hym with-oute þe gate. Kynges and Cardineles knowen hym som tyme, Ac þorw couetise and his consail congeied is he ofte. And ho so coueyteþ to know hym such [a] kynde hym folweþ, As ich tolde þe with tonge a lytel tyme passed; For noþer he beggeþ, ne biddeþ ne borweþ to ?elde; He halt hit a nycete and a foul shame To beggen oþer to borwe bote of god one; Panem nostrum cotidianum [da nobis hodie].” Hic explicit passus septimus &amp; ultimus de dowel. Visio eiusdem Willelmi de Do-bet. PASSUS XVIII. (DO-BET I.) Incipit passus primus de dobet. “Ther is no suche,” ich seide “þat som tyme neborweth, Oþer beggeþ oþer byddeþ beo he ryche oþer poure, And ?ut oþer-while wroþ with-oute eny synne.” “Ho so is wroþ and wolde be awreke holi wryt,” quaþ he, “proueþ. He passeþ chief charite if holichurche beo trewe; Caritas omnia suffert. Holy writ witnesseþ þer were suche eremites, Solitarie by hem-self and in here selles lyueden Wiþ-oute borwynge oþer beggynge bote of god one; Excepte þat egidie an hynde oþer-while To hus selle selde cam and suffrede to be melked. Elles fouweles fedden hem in frythes þer þei woneden, Boþe antonye and erseny and oþer mo fele. Paul primus heremita hadde parroked hym-selue, That no man myghte se hym for muche mos and leues; Foweles hym fedde yf frere austyn be trewe; For he ordeynede þat ordre other elles þei gabben. Paul after his prechynge panyeres he made, And wan with hus hondes al þat hym neodyde. Peter fysshed for hus fode and hus fere Andreu; Som thei solde, and som thei sode and so þei leueden boþe. Marie magdalene by mores leuede and dewes; Loue and leel by-leuye heeld lyf and soule to-gedere. Maria egyptiaca eet in þyrty wynter Bote þre lytel loues and loue was her souel. Ich can nat rekene hem ryght now ne reherce here names, That lyueden þus for oure lordes loue meny longe ?eres, With-oute borwyng oþer beggyng oþer þe bok lyeþ, And woneden in wildernesse a-mong wilde bestes; Ac dorst no best byten hem by daye ne by nyghte, Bote myldeliche, whan þei metten maden louh chere, And feyre by-fore þo men fauhnede with þe tayles. Ac bestes brouhte hem no mete bot onliche þe fouweles, In tokenynge þat trewe man alle tymes sholde Fynde honeste men [and] holy men and oþer ryghtful peuple. For wolde neuere feithful god þat freres and monkes token Lyflode of luþer wynnynges in al here lif-tyme. As wytnesseþ holy writ what thobie seyde To his wif, whan he was blynde [he] herde a lamb blete; ‘A! wyf! be war,’ quaþ he ‘what ?e haue here-ynne; Lord leyue,’ quaþ þe lede ‘no stole þyng be here!’ Videte ne furtum sit: &amp; alibi, melius est mori quam male uiuere. This is no more to mene bote men of holychurche Sholde receyue ryght nau?t bot þat ryght wolde, And refuse reuerences and raueneres offrynges. Thenne wolde lordes and ladies be loth for to agulte, And to take of here tenauns more þan treuthe wolde; And marchauns merciable wolde be and men of lawe boþe. Wolde religiouse refuse raueneres almesse, Then grace sholde growe ?ut and grene-leued wexe, And charite, þat child is now sholde chaufen of [him-]self, And confortye alle cristene wold holy [kirke] amende. Iob þe parfit patriark þis prouerbe wrot and tauhte, To makye a man louye mesure þat monkes beeþ and Freres; Nunquam, dicit Iob, rugiet onager cum habuerit herbam, aut mugiet bos cum ante plenum presepe steterit? Brutorum animalium natura te condempnat, quia cum pabulum sufficiat commune, ex adipe prodiit iniquitas. Yf lewede men knewe this latyn a litel þei wolde auisen hem Er thei amorteisede eny more for monkes oþer for chanons. Alas! lordes and ladies lewede counsail haue [?e] Þat founded beþ to fulle to feffe suche and fede With þat ?oure barnes and ?oure blod by goode lawe may cleyme! For god bad hus blessede as þe book techeþ, Honora patrem &amp; matrem, [ut longeuus sis, &amp;c.] To helpe þy fader formest by-fore freres and monkes, And er prestes oþer pardoneres oþer eny peuple elles. Help þi kynne, crist bit for þer by-gynneþ charite, And afterwarde awaite hoo haþ moost neede, And þer help yf þou hast and þat halde ich Charite. Loo! laurence for hus largenesse! as holy lore telleþ, Þat hus mede and hus man-hede for euere-more shal laste; Iusticia eius manet in eternum. He gaf godes men [godes] goodes and nat to grete lordes, And fedde þat a-fyngred were and in defaute lyueden. Ich dar nat carpe of clerkes now þat cristes tresoure kepen, That poure peuple by pure ryght here part thei myghten aske; Of þat [þat] holychurche of þe olde lawe cleymeþ, Priestes on aparail and on purnele spenen. Men may lykne letterid men to a lussheborgh, oþer werse, And to a badde peny with a good preynte. For of muche moneye þe metal is ryght nauht, ?ut is þe prente pure trewe an parfitliche graue. And so it fareþ by false cristine here follouht is trewe, Cristendome of holy[kirke] þe kynges marke of heuene; Ac þe metal, þat is mannes saule of meny of þese techeres Is alayed with lecherie and oþer lustes of synne, That god coueiteþ nat [þe] coygne þat crist hym-self prentede; And for synne of [þe] soule for-sakeþ hus owne coygne. Thus are þe lithere lykned to lussheborue sterlinges, That faire by-fore folke prechen and techen, And worchen nat as þei fynden wryten and wissen þe peuple. For what þorw werre and wrake and wycked hyfdes, May no preiour pees make in no place, hit semeþ; Lewede men hauen no by-leyue so letterid men erren. Neiþer þe see ne þe sande ne þe seed ?eldeþ As þei woned were; in wham is defaute? Nat in god, þat he nys good and þe grounde boþe; And þe see and þe seed the sonne and þe mone Don her deuer day and ny?t and yf we duden also, Ther sholde be plente and pees perpetuel for euere. [Wederwise] shupmen now and oþer witty peuple Han no by-leyue to þe lyft ne to þe lood-sterre; Astronomyens al day in here art faillen, That whilom warned men by-fore what shoulde by-falle after. Shupmen and shephurdes by the seuen sterres Wisten while and tolden whenne hit shoulde reynen. Tyliers þat tyleden þe erthe tolden here maystres By þe seed þat þei sewe what þei shoulde notye, And what lyue by and lene þe londe was so trewe. Now failleþ þis folke boþe sowers and shupmen, Noþer þei knoweþ ne conneþ o cours by a-noþer. Astronomyens al-so aren at here wittes end; Of þat was calculed of þe clymat the contrarye þey fyndeth. Grammere, þat grounde is of alle by-gyleþ now children; For þer is nouthe non who so nymeþ hede, That can [versifie] fayre oþer formeliche endite, Ne þat can construen kyndeliche þat poetes maden. Gowe now to eny degre and, bote gyle be halde a mayster, And a flaterer for hus vsshere [a] ferliche me þynkeþ! Doctours of decree and of dyuyn maystres, That shoulde þe seuene ars conne and a-soile ad quodlibet, Bote þei faille in fylosophye —and filosophers lyueden, [And wolde wel examene hem— wonder me þynkeþ!] Lord leyue þat þese preestes leelly seyn here masses, That þei ouerhuppe nat for hast! as ich hope thei do nat, [Þogh] hit suffise for oure sauacion sothfast by-leyue; As clerkus in corpus-christi feste syngen and reden, That sola fides sufficit to saue with lewede peuple. Ac yf preestes do her deuer wel we shullen do þe bettere. For saresyns mowe be saued so yf þei so by-leyuede, In þe lengthynge of here lyf to leyue on holychurche.” “What is holychurche, frend?” quoþ ich “charite,” he seyde, “Lyf, and loue, and leaute in o by-leyue [and] lawe, [A loue-knotte] of leaute and of leel by-leyue, Alle kynne cristene cleuynge on o wyl, With-oute gyle and gabbynge gyue and selle and lene. Loue lawe with-oute leaute lowable was it neuere; God lereþ no lyf to loue with-oute leel cause: Iewes, gentiles, and sarrasines Iugen hem-selue That leeliche þei by-leyuen and ?ut here lawe [dyuerseþ]; And on god þat al by-gan with goode herte þei honoureþ, [And eiþer loueþ, and bileuiþ in on lord al-my?ti.] Ac oure lorde loueþ, no loue bote lawe be þe cause; For lechours louen a?en þe lawe and at þe laste beeþ dampned: And theeues [louen, and] leaute haten and at þe laste beeþ hanged: And leelle men louen as lawe techeþ and loue þer-of aryseþ, The which is hefd of charite and hele of mannes soule. Dilige deum propter deum; id propter ueritatem est. Et inimicum tuum propter mandatum; id propter legem est. Et amicum propter amorem; id est, propter caritatem. Loue God, for he is good and grounde of alle treuthe; Loue þyn enemy entyerly godes heste to ful-fille; Loue þy frend þat folweþ þy wil þat is [þy] faire soule. For whanne alle frendes faillen and fleen a-wey in deiynge, Then suweþ þe þy soule to sorwe oþer to ioye, And ay hopeþ eft to be with here bodye atte laste In murthe oþer in mornynge and neuere eft to departe. And þat is charite, my leue childe to be cher ouer thi soule; Contrarie hure nauht, as in conscience yf þou wolt come to heuene.” “[Wher] sarrasyns,” ich seyde “seo nat what is charite?” “Hit may be þat sarrasyns hauen a suche manere charite, Louye, as by lawe of kynde oure lord god al-myghty. Hit is a kynde þyng, a creature hus creatour to honoure; For þer is no man þat mynde hath þat ne meokeþ hym and by-secheþ To þat lord þat hym lyf lente and lyflode him sendeþ. Ac meny manere men þer beoþ as sarrasyns and Iewes, Louyeþ nat þat lorde a-ryght as by þe legende sanctorum, And lyuen oute of leel by-leyue for thei leyue in a mene. A man þat hihte makamede for messye thei hym heolde, And after hus lerynge thei lyuen and by lawe of kynde. And when kynde hath hus cours and no contrarye fyndeth, Þenne is lawe lost and lewete vnknowen. Beaute saunz bounte blessed was hit neuere, Ne kynde saunz cortesie In no contreye preysed. Men fyndeþ þat makamede was a man ycrystned, And a cardinal of court a gret clerk with-alle, And porsuede to haue be pope pryns of holychurche; And for he was lyke a lussheborgh ich leyue oure lord hym lette. For-thi souhte he in-to surrye and sotile[d] hou he myghte Beo mayster ouer alle þo men and on þis manere wroughte. He endauntede a douue day and nyght here fedde; In aiþer of hus eris pryueliche he hadde Corn, þat þe coluer eet when he cam in places. And in what place he prechede and þe peuple tauhte, Then sholde þe coluere come to the clerkes ere, Menynge as after mete thus makamede here enchauntede. And whan þe coluer kam þus þenne [knelede] þe peuple, For makemede to onen swor ‘hit was a messager of heueue, And sothly god self in suche a coluere lyknesse Tolde hym and tauhte hym hou to teche þe peuple.’ Thus makamede in mysbyleyue man and womman brouhte, And in hus lore thei leyuen ?ut as wel lered as lewede. And sutthe oure sauyour suffrede suche a fals crystine Deceyue so sarrasyns sothly me thynkeþ, Holy men, as ich hope thorw help of þe holy gost, Sholde conuerten hem to crist and cristendom [to] take. Alas! þat men so longe on makamede by-leyuen, So meny [prelates] to preche as þe [pope] makeþ, Of Nazareth, of Nynyve of Neptalym, of damaske, That thei ne wendeþ þe wey as holy writ biddeth, Ite in universum mundum sutthe ?e wilneþ þe name To be prelates, and preche þe passion of Ihesus, And as hym-self seyde so lyue and deye; Bonus pastor animam suam ponit pro ouibus suis. Hit is reuthe to rede hou ryght holy men lyueden, How thei defouleden here fleessh for-soken here owen wil, Fer fro kuth and fro kyn vuel-cloþed ?eoden, Baddeliche beddyd no book bote here conscience, Noþer richesse bote þe rode to reioysen hem inne; Absit [nobis] gloriari nisi in cruce domini nostri iesu christi. And þo was pees and plente a-mong poure and riche; And now is reuthe to rede hou þe rede noble Ys yreuerenced by-fore þe rode and receyuyd for þe worthier To a-mende and to make as with men of holichurche, Than cryst, oþer croys þat ouercam deþ and dedly synne!— And now is werre and wo and ho so ‘whi’ askeþ, For couetyse after a croys þe croune stant in golde. Boþe riche and religiouse that rode þei honouren Þat in grotes is y-graue and in gold nobles. For couetyse of þat croys clerkes of holychurche Schullen ouerturne as templers duden þe tyme aprocheþ faste. Mynne ?e nat, lettered men hou þo men honourede More tresour [þan] treuthe? ich dar nat telle þe sothe How þo corsede crystine catel and richesse worshepeden; Reyson and Ri?tful dome þe religious damnede. Right so, ?e clerkus, ?oure couetise er come ouht longe, Shal dampne dos ecclesie and depose ?ow for ?oure pruyde; Deposuit potentes de sede. Yf kny?t-hod and kynde wit and þe comune and conscience To-gederes louen leelliche leyueþ hit wel, bisshopes, [Þe] lordshup of londes leese ?e shulle for euere, And lyuen as leuitici dude and as our lord ?ow techeþ, Per primicias et decimas. Whenne constantyn of hus cortesye holy[kirke] dowede With londes and leedes lordshepes and rentes, An angel men hurde an hih at rome crye— ‘Dos ecclesie this day haþ ydronke venym, And tho þat han petres power aren poysoned alle.’ A medecine moste þer-to þat myghte amende þe prelates, That sholden preye for þe pees and possession hem letteþ; Takeþ here londes, ?e lordes and leet hem lyue by dymes, Yf ?e kynges coueyten in cristene pees to lyuen. For yf posession be poyson and inparfyt hem make, The heuedes of holychurche and tho þat be vnder hem, Hit were charite to deschargen hem for holychurches sake, And purge hem of þe olde poyson ere more perel falle. For were preest-hod more parfyt þat is, þe pope formest, That wiþ moneye menteyneþ men to werren vp-on cristine, A-?ens þe lore of oure lorde as seynt luk wytnesseþ, Michi uindictam, [&amp; ego retribuam, dicit dominus, &amp;c.] Hus prayers with hus pacience to pees sholde brynge Alle londes to loue and þat in a lytel tyme; The pope with alle preestes pax-uobis sholde make! And take hede hou makamede þorwe a mylde doue, He hald al surrye as hym-self wolde and sarasyns in quyete; Nouht þorw man lauht and [mannes] strengthe makamede hadde þe mastrie, Bote þorw pacience and pryuy gyle he was prynce ouer hem alle. In suche manere, me þynkeþ moste þe pope, Prelates, and preestes prayen and by-seche Deuowtliche day and ny?t and wiþ-drawe hem fro synne, And crye to crist þat he wolde hus coluere sende, The whiche is þe holy gost þat out of heuene descendede, To make a perpetuel pees by-twyne þe prynce of heuene And alle manere [of] men þat on þis molde lybbeþ. Yf preest-hod were parfit and preyede thus the peuple sholde amende, That now contrarien cristes lawes and cristendom despisen. For sutthe þat þes sarasyns scribes, and þese Iewes Hauen a lippe of oure by-leyue þe lightloker, me þynkeþ, Thei sholde turne, [who so] trauayle wolde and of þe trinite techen hem. For alle paynymes preyen and parfitliche by-leyuen In þe grete heye god and hus grace asken, And maken here mone to makamede here message to shewe. Thus in a faith lyueþ þat folke and in a false mene; And þat is reuthe for þe [ryghtful] men þat in þe reame wonyeþ, [And perel for þe prelates þat þe pope makeþ;] [Þat] bereþ name of Neptalym of Nynyue and of damaske. For when þe holy kynge of heuene sende hus sone to erthe, Meny myracles he wrouhte man for to turne, In ensample þat men sholde seo by sad reyson, That men myghte nat be sauede bote þorw mercy and grace, And þorw penaunce and passioun and parfyt by-leyue; And by-cam a man of a mayde and metropolitanus, And baptisede, and busshoppede with þe blode of hus herte Alle þat wilnede oþer wolde with inwit by-leue hit. Meny seint sitthe suffrede deþ al-so; For to enforme þe faithe ful wyde-where deyden, In Inde and in alisaundrie in ermanye, in spayne, And fro mysbyleue meny man turnede. In sauacion of mannys saule seynt thomas of Caunterbury Among vnkynde cristene in holychurche was sleye, And alle holychurche honoured for þat deyinge. He is a forbusne to alle busshopes and a bry?t myrour, And souereyneliche to alle suche þat of surrye bereþ name; And nat in engelonde to huppe abowte and halewen menne auters, And crepe in a-monge [curatours] and confessen a-?en þe lawe; Nolite mittere falcem in messem alienam. Meny man for crystes loue was martred a-mong romaynes Er cristendome were knowe þer oþer eny croys honoured. Eueriche busshope, by þe lawe sholde buxumliche wende, And pacientliche, þorgh hus prouynce and to hus peple hym shewe, Feden hem and [fillen] hem and fere hem fro synne; In baculi forma sit presul hec tibi norma, Fer, trahe, punge gregem seruando per omnia legem; And enchaunte hem to charite on holychurche to be-leyue. For as the kynde is of a kny?t oþer for a kynge to be take, [And] among here enemys in morteils bateles To be culled and ouercome þe comune to defende; So is þe kynde of [a curatour] for cristes loue to preche, And deye for hus dere children to destroye dedly synne; Bonus pastor; And nameliche þer as lewede lyuen and no lawe knowen. Ac we crystine conneþ þe lawe and hauen of oure tounge Busshopes and bookes the byleyue to teche. Iuwes lyuen in þe lawe þat oure lord tauhte, Moyses to be maister þer-of til messie come, And in þat lawe þei leyue and leten hit for the beste. And ?ut knewe þei crist þat cristendome tauhte, And for a parfyt prophete þat muche peuple sauede, And of selcouþe sores sauede men ful ofte; By þe myracles þat he made messie he semede, Tho he lyfte vp lazar þat leyde was in graue, Quatriduanus cold quik dude hym walke. Iuwes seyden, þat hit seyn with sorcerie he wrouhte, And [stodieden] hou to struyen [him] and struyeden hem-selue, And here power thourh hus pacience to pure nouht brouhte. And [?ut] thei seien soþliche and so doþ þe sarrasyns, That Iesus was bote a Iogelour a Iaper a-monge þe comune, And a sophistre of sorcerie and pseudo-propheta, And hus lore was lesynge and lacken hit alle, And hopen þat he be to comynge þat shal hem releue; Moyses oþer Makemede here maistres deuineþ; And haueþ suspecion to be saf boþe sarrasyns and Iewes, Thorwe Moyses and makamede and myghte of god þat mad al.

PASSUS XIX (DO-BET II). Hic Incipit Passus Secundus de Dobet. “Leue liberum arbitrium,” quaþ ich “ich leyue, as ich hope, Thou couþest telle and teche me to charite, ich leyue?” Then louh liberum arbitrium and ladde me forþ with tales, Til we comen in-to a contree cor-hominis hit hyhte, Herber of alle pryuytees and of holynesse. Euene in þe myddes an ympe, as hit were, Þat hihte ymago-dei graciousliche hit growede. Thenne gan ich asken what hit hyhte and he me sone tolde— “Þe tree hihte trewe-loue,” quaþ he “the trinite hit sette; Þorgh louely lokynge hit lyueþ and launceþ vp blossemes, The whiche blosmes burnes benygne-speche callen; And þer-of comeþ a good frut þe which men callen werkes Of holynesse, of hendynesse of help-hym-þat neodeþ, The whiche is callid caritas cristes owen fode, And solaceþ alle soules sorghful in purgatorie.” “Now, certes,” ich seide and sykede for ioye, “Ich þonke [?ow] a þowsend sythes þat ?e me hider kende; And suþþen þat ?e fowche-saue to seye me what hit hihte.” And he þonked me þo bote þenne took ich hede, Hit hadde shoriers to shoue hit vp þre shides of o lengþe, And of o kynne colour and o kynde, as me þouhte, All þre yliche longe and yliche large. Muche meruailede me on what more thei growede; And efte askede of hym of what wode þei were? “Thees þre shoryeres,” quaþ he “þat bereþ vp þis plonte, Thei by-tokneþ trewely þe trinite of heuene; Thre persons in-departable perpetuel were euer, Of o wyl, of o wit and here-with ich kepe The frut of þis faire tree fro þre wykkede wyndes, And fro fallyng of stok hit faille nouht of hus myghte. The worlde is a wykkede wynde to hem þat wolde treuthe; Covetyse comeþ of þat wynde and [caritas hit abiteþ,] And for-freteþ þat frut with manye fayre syghtes; And with þe ferste plaunke ich palle hym doune potencia-dei-patris. Þanne is flessh a fel wynde in flouryng-tyme; Þorgh lecherie and lustes so loude he gynneþ blowe, Þat hit norischeþ nyce sy?tes and som tyme wordes, And menye wykkede wormes workes of synne, And al for-bit caritas to þe bare stalke; Thanne sette ich þe secunde plaunke sapiencia-dei-patris, The which is þe passion and penaunce and þe parfytnesse of ihesus, And þer-with ich warde hit oþer-whyle til hit wexe rype. Thenne fondeþ þe feende my frut to destruye, And leith a laddere þer-to of lesynges be þe ronges; With alle þe wyles þat he can waggeþ þe roote Þorw bak-byters and braweleres and þorwe bolde chyderes, And shakeþ hit; ne were hit vnder-shored certes hit sholde nat stande. So þese lourdeines litheren þer-to þat alle þe leues fallen, And feccheth a-way this frut som tyme by-fore boþe myn eyen. Thenne palle ich a-downe þe pouke with þe þridde shoryere, The whiche is spiritus-sanctus and soþ-fast byleyue, And þat is grace of þe holy gost; and þus gat ich þe mastrye.” Ich totide vp-on þat tree þo and þenne tok ich hede, Wheþer þe frut were faire oþer foul to loken on. And þe frut was wonder fair non fairer beo myghte; Ac in þre degrees hit grew gret ferly me þouhte, And askede þo ‘yf hit were al of on kynde?’ “?e, certes,” he seide “and sothliche þow leyue hit. Hit is al of o kynde and þat shal ich prouen; Ac somme ar swettere þan some and sonnere wollen rotye. Men may seo on an appul-treo meny tyme and ofte, Of o kynne apples aren nat yliche grete, Ne of sewynge smale ne of [o] swetnesse swete. Tho þat sitten in þe sonne-syde sonner aren rype, Swettour and saueriour and also more grettoure Than [þo] þat selde hauen þe sonne and sitten in þe north-half; And so hit fareþ sothly sone, by oure kynde. Adam was as tree and we aren as hus apples, Somme of ows sothfast and some variable, Somme litel and some large like apples of kynde. As weddede men and wedewes and ry?t worthy maidenes, Þe whiche þe seynt esprit [seweþ] the sonne of al heuene, Conforteþ [hem] in here continence þat lyuen in contemplacion, As monkes and monyeles men of holichurche; These hauen hete of þe holi gost as crop of treo þe sonne. Wedewes and wedeweres þat here owen wil for-saken, And chast leden here lyf ys lyf of contemplacion, And more lykyng to oure lorde þan lyue as kynde askeþ, And folwe þat þe flessh wole and frut forþ brynge, That lettered men in here langage actiua-uita callen.” “?e, syre,” ich seide, “and sitthen þer aren bote two lyues Þat oure lorde a-loweþ as lered men ous techeþ, That is actiua-uita and uita contemplatiua, Whi groweþ this frut in þre degrees?” “for a good skyle,” he seide; “Her by-neoþe ich may nyme yf ich neode [hadde,] Matrimonye, a moiste frut þat multiplieþ þe peple. Thenne a-boue is a betere frut ac boþe two ben goode, Wedewehode, more worþier þan wedlok, as in heuene. Þanne is virginite, more vertuous and fairest as in heuene, For þat is euene with angeles and angeles peer. Hit was þe furste frut þat þe fader of heuene blessede, And bad hit be [of] a bat of erþe a man and a mayde; In menynge þat þe faireste þyng þe furste þyng sholde honoure, And þe clennest creature creatour ferste knowe. In kynges court and knyghtes þe clennest men and fairest Shullen serue for þe lord selue so fareþ god almyghty. Maidenes and marteres ministred hym her in erthe, And in heuene buth most pryue and next hym by reson, For þe fairest frut by-fore hym as of eorthe, And swete wiþ-oute swellinge soure worth hit neuere.” “This is a propre plonte,” quaþ ich “and pryueliche hit bloweþ, And bryngeþ forþ faire frut folke of all nacion, Bothe parfit and inparfit; pure fayn ich wolde A-saye what sauour hit hadde” ich seide þat tyme; “Leue liberum arbitrium leet som lyf hit shake.” A-non he het elde an hih for to clymbe, And shaken hit sharply þe ripen sholden falle. Elde clam towarde þe crop þan comsede hit to crie; He waggede wedewehode and hit wepte after; He meuede matrimonye hit made a foule noyse. For euere as elde hadde eny doun þe deuel was wel redy, And gederide hem alle to-gederis boþe grete and smale, Adam and abraham and Ysaye þe prophete, Sampson and samuel and seynt Iohan þe baptist, And bar hem forþ baldely no body þo hym lette, And made of holy men hus horde in limbo inferni, Ther is derknesse and drede and þe deuel maister. Þenne meuede hym mod in maiestate dei, Þat libera uoluntas dei lauhte þe myddel shoriere, And hitte after þe fende happe hou hit myghte. Filius, by þe faders wil flegh with spiritus sanctus, To ransake [þat] rageman and reue hym hus apples, Þat fyrst man deceyuede thorgh frut and false by-heste. And þenne spake spiritus sanctus in gabrielis mouthe To [a] mayde þat hihte marie [a] meek þyng with alle, Þat on Iesus, a Iustice sone moste Iouken in hire chaumbre, Til plenitudo temporis tyme [y]come were, That elde felde efte þat frut oþer fulle to be rype, Þat Iesus sholde Iuste þer-fore [in] Iugement of armes, Who sholde fecche þis frut þe feend oþer Iesus self. The maide myldeliche þo þe messager hue answerede, And saide hendyliche to him “loo, me, hus handmayde, For to worchen hus wil with-oute eny synne; Ecce ancilla domini, [fiat michi secundum verbum tuum,]” &amp;c. And in þe wombe of þat wenche he was fourty wokes, And man by-cam of þat mayde to saue mankynde, Byg and abydynge and bold in hus barn-hede, To hauen fouhten with þe feende ar ful tyme come. Ac liberum arbitrium leche-crafte hym tauhte, Til plenitudo temporis hih tyme a-prochede, That suche a surgeyn setthen yseye was þer neuere, Ne non so faithfol fysician; for, alle þat [hym] bysouhte, He lechede hem of here langoure lazars and blynde bothe; Ceci uident, claudi ambulant, leprosi mundantur: And comune wymmen conuertede and clansede hem of synne. And he lyft vp Lazar þat lay in hus tombe, Quatriduanus cold quyke dude hym rome. Ac er he made þat miracle mestus cepit esse, And wepte water with hus eyen the whi witen fewe. Ac þoo þat seyen þat selcouþ seyden þat tyme, Þat he was god oþer godes sone for þat grete wonder. And somme Iewes seiden with sorcerie he wrouhte, And þorwe þe myghte of Mahon and þorw mysbyleyue; Demonium habes. “Thanne sathan is ?oure sauyour,” quaþ Iesus “and haþ saued ?ow ofte; Ac ich sauede ?ow sondry tymes [and] also ich fedde ?ow With fisshes and with fyf loues fyfe þousend at ones, And þer-of lefte baskettes ful of broke mete, Broke bred, to beren hit a-weye hoo so wolde. Vnkynde and vnknowing!” quaþ Crist and with a rop smot hem, And ouer-turnede in þe temple here tables and here stalles, And drof hem out alle þat þer bowten and solde, [Eiecit ementes &amp; vendentes de templo, &amp;c.] And seide, “þis is an hous of orisouns and of holynesse, And whenne þat my wil is ich [wol] hit ouer-throwe, And er þre dayes after edefye hit newe;” [Intra triduum reedificabo illud.] The Iewes tolden þe Iustice how þat Iesus seyde; Ac þe ouerturnyng of þe temple by-tokned þe resureccion. Enuye and vuel will ?orn in þe Iewes, And porsuede [hym] pryueliche and for pans hym bouhte, Ne forte tumultus fieret in populo, Of Iudas þe Iewe Iesus owene disciple. This by-fil on a fryday a litel by-fore paske, Þat Iudas and Iewes Iesus thei mette. “Aue, rabbi,” quaþ þat ribaud and right til hym he ?ede, And custe Iesus, to be knowe þer-by and kauht of þe Iewes. Thanne Iesus to Iudas and to þe Iewes seyde, “Falsnesse ich fynde in þy faire speche, And kene care in þy cossyn[g]s and combraunce to [þi]selue. Thow shalt be myrour to menye men to deceyue; Wo to hem þat þy wiles vsen to þe worldes ende! Ve homini illi per quem scandalum uenit. Sitthe ich by treson am take and to ?oure [wille,] Iewes, Suffreþ myne apostles in pees and in pees gangen;” [Sinite hos abire, &amp;c.] Thus Iewes to þe Iustices iesus thei ladden.— With muche noyse þat nyght ner frentik ich awakede, In Inwit and in alle wittes after liberum arbitrium Ich waitede wyterly, ac ne wiste whider he wente, And þanne mette ich wiþ a man on mydlentens soneday, As hor as an haweþorn and abraam he hihte. “Of whennes art þow?” quaþ ich and hendeliche hym grette. “Ich am with faiþ,” quaþ þat freek “hit falleþ nat me to lye, An heraude of armes er eny lawe were.” “What is hus conysaunce,” quaþ ich “in hus cotearmure?” “Þre persones in o pensel,” quath he “departable from oþer; O speche and o spirit spryngeþ out of alle, Of o wit, of on wil were neuere a-twynne; And sondry to seo vpon solus deus he hoteþ.” “Siþthen thei ben surlepes,” quaþ ich “thei han sondry names.” “That is soþ,” saide he “þe syre hatte pater; And þe secunde is a sone of þe syre, filius; The þridde is þat halt al a þyng by hym-selue, Holigost is hus name and he is in alle.” “This is merk þyng for me,” quaþ ich “and for meny oþer, How o lord myghte lyue a þre ich leyue hit nat,” ich seyde. “Muse not to muche þer-on,” quaþ faith “tyl þow more knowe, Ac looke þow leyue hit leelly al þy lyf-tyme, That þre by-longeþ to on lorde that lygaunce cleymeþ, Mighte, and [a] mene to seo hus owen Mighte, Of hym-self and of hus seruaunt and [what] suffreþ hem boþe. God þat gynnynge hadde neuere bote þo hym gode þouhte, Sente forth hus sone as for seruaunt þat tyme, To okupien hym here til issue were spronge, The whiche aren children of charite and holichurche þe moder. Patriarkes and prophetes and apostles were þe children; And crist and cristendome and cristene holichurche By-tokeneþ þe trinite and trewe by-leyue. O god almyghty þat man made and wrouhte, Semblable to hym-self er eny synne were, A þre he is þer he is and hereof bereþ wittnesse Þe werkes þat hym-self wrouhte and þis worlde boþe; Celi enarrant gloriam dei, &amp; opera manuum eius annunciat firmamentum. That he is þre persones departable ich proue hit by man-kynde, And o god almyghty yf alle men beo of adam. Eue was of adam and out of hym ydrawe, And abel of hem boþe and alle þre o kynde; [Ac] these þre þat ich carpe of adam, and eue, And abel, here issue aren bote on in man-hede. Matrimonie with-oute moillere is nat muche to preyse, The bible bereþ witnesse a book of þe olde lawe, Þat a-corsed alle couples þat no kynde forth brouhte; Maledictus sit homo qui non reliquit semen in israel. And a man with-oute a make myghte nat wel of kynde Multeplie, ne more-ouer with-oute a make louye, Ne with-oute a sowere be suche seede þis we seen alle. Now go we to god-hede; in god, fader of heuene, Was þe sone in hym-selue in a simile, as eue Was, whanne god wolde out of þe wye y-drawe. And as abel of adam and of hus wif eue Sprang forth and spak a spire of hem tweyne, So out of þe syre and of þe sone the seynt espirit of bothe Ys, and ay [was] and worth with-outen ende. And as þre persones palpable is pureliche bote o man-kynde, The whiche is man and hus make and moillere-is issue, So is god godes sone in þre persones þe trinite. In matrimonie aren þre and of o man cam alle þre, And to godhede goþ þre and of o god is alle þre; Loo, treys encountre treys,” quaþ he “in godhede and in manhede.” “Hauest þow seyen þis?” ich seide “alle þre, and o god?” “In a somer ich seyh hym,” quaþ he “as ich sat in my porche, Where god cam goynge a-þre ryght by my gate; Tres uidit et unum adorauit. Ich ros vp and reuerencede god and ryght fayre hym grette, Wesh here feet, and wypede hem and after þei eten, And what ich þouhte and my wyf he ous wel tolde. He by-hihte ous issue and heir in oure olde age, Ful trewe tokne by-twyne ous is what tyme þat ich mette hym; How he fondede me ferst my faire sone ysaac, To make sacrifice of hym he het me, hym to honoure. Ich with-sat nat hus heste ich hope and by-leyue Wher ich walke in þis worlde he wol hit me a-lowe. Ich circumsysede my sone and al-so, for hus sake, My-self and my meyne and alle þat maule were Bledden blod for þat lordes loue ich hope to blesse þe tyme. Myn affiaunce and my feith is ferm [in] hus by-leyue; For hym-self seide ich sholde haue and myn issue boþe Lond and lordshup ynow and lyf with-outen ende. To me and to myn issue more he by-hihte, Mercy for oure mysdedes as meny tymes As we wilnede and wolde with mouth and herte asken. And sitthen he sende me to sayn and seide þat ich sholde Worshupen hym with wyn and with bred boþe At ones on an auter in worshup of þe trinite, And make sacrifice so som-what hit by-tokneþ; Ich leyue þat þilke lorde thenke a newe lawe to make; Fiet unum ouile et unus pastor. Thus haue ich beo hus heraude her and in helle, And comforted menye carful þere þat after hus comyng loken. For-thi ich seke him,” he seide “for seynt Iohan þe baptist Seide þat he seih hym her þat sholde [saue] ous alle; Ecce agnus dei [qui tollit peccata mundi].” Thenne hadde ich wonder of hus wordes and of hus wide cloþes, For in hus bosom he bar a þyng and þat he blessede ofte. And ich loked in hus lappe a lazar lay þer-ynne, With patriarkes and prophetes pleiynge to-gederes. “What waytest þow,” quaþ faith “and what woldest thou haue?” “Ich wolde wyte,” quaþ ich þo “what is in þy lappe?” “Loo!” quaþ he, and leet me seo “lord, mercy!” ich seide, “This is a present of muche prys what pryns shal hit haue?” “Hit is a preciouse present,” quaþ he “ac þe pouke hit haþ attached, And me þer-wiþ,” quaþ þe wye “may no wed ous quite, Ne no bern beo oure borghe ne brynge ous out of daunger, Fro þe poukes poundfalde no maynprise may ous fecche, Til he come that ich carpe of crist is hus name, Þat shal delyuery ous som day out of þe deueles powere, And betere wed for ous wagen þan alle we beon worthi, And þat is, lif for lyf oþer ligge þus euere, [Lollynge] in my lappe þus til such a lord ous fecche.” “Alas!” ich seide, “þat synne so longe shal lette The myght of godes mercy þat myghte ous alle amende!” And wepte for hus wordes; with þat ich seyh an oþer Rappliche renne þe righte wey we wente; And ich fraynede hym furst fro whennes he come, What he hihte, and whider he wolde and wyghtliche he ous tolde.

Hic incipit passus tercius de dobet. “Ich am spes, [a spye],” quaþ he “and spire after a knyght, Þat tooke me a maundement vp-on þe mounte of synay, To ruele alle reames þer-with in right and [in] reison. Loo, here þe lettere,” quaþ he “in latyn and in ebrew, That ich seye is soþe seo ho so lykeþ.” “Ys hit a-seled?” ich seyde “may men seo þe letteres?” “Nay,” he seyde, “ich seke hym þat haþ þe seel to kepe, The whiche is criste and cristendome and a croys þeron to honge. Were hit þer-with a-seeled ich wote wel þe soþe, That lucifers lordshup ligge sholde ful lowe.” “Leet se thi letteres,” quaþ ich “we myghte þe lawe knowe.” He plyghte forþ a patente a pece of an harde roche, Wher-on was write two wordes in þis wise glosede; Dilige deum &amp; proximum [tuum]. This was þe tyxt treweliche ich toke ful good gome; The glose gloryousliche was wryte wyth a gylt penne; In his duobus mandatis pendet tota lex [&amp; prophete]. “Ys her al þy lordes lettere?” quaþ ich “?e, [leue me,” he] sayde, “And ho so worcheþ after þis write ich wol vnder-take, Shal neuere deouel hym dere ne deþ in soule greue. For þauh ich seye hit my-self ich haue saued with þis charme Of men and of wymmen meny score þousend.” “He seiþ soþ,” seide faith “ich haue founde hit trewe. Loo, her in my lappe,” quaþ faith “þat leyuede vp-on þe lettere, Boþe Iosue and Iudith and Iudas makabeus, And sixe þousand mo,” quaþ faith “ich can nat [seye] here names.” “?oure wordes aren wonderful,” quaþ ich “wher eny of ?ow be trewe And leel to be-leyuen on for body oþer for soule? Abraam seith þat he seih holiche þe trinite, Þre persones parcel-mele departable from oþer, And alle þre bote o god; thus abraam bereþ wittnesse, And ysauede þat by-leyueþ so and sory for here synnes, He can no certayn summe telle and somme aren in hus lappe. What neodeþ [hit] þanne a newe lawe to brynge, Sutthe þe furste suffisede so by-leyue and be ysaued? And now comeþ her this spes and haþ aspied þe lawe, Þat of þe trinite ne telleþ ne takeþ mo persones To god-hede, bote o god and o god almyghty, The whiche alle men aren holde ouere alle þyng to honoure; And sitthe to loue and to leue for þat lordes sake Alle manere of men as muche as ous self. And for to louye and to leyue in o lord almyghty. Hit is lyght for lewede and for lerede boþe; Ac for to by-leyue in o lorde þat lyueþ in þre persones, And lereþ þat we louye sholde as wel lyeres as leele— Go þy gat,” quaþ ich [to] spes “so me god helpe, Tho þat leorneþ thi lawe wolle litel while hit vsen!” And as we wente in the way thus [wordyng of] þis matere, Then seih we a samaritan cam syttynge on a mule, Rydynge ful raply þe ryght way þat we wente, Comynge fram a contreie þat men callide Ierico, To Iusten in ierusalem he iacede awey ful faste. Boþe abraam and spes [and] he metten to-gederes In a wilde wildernesse wher theoues hadden bounde A man, as me tho thouhte to muche care þei brouhte. For he ne myghte steppe ne stande ne stere fot ne hondes, Ne helpe hym-selue sothliche for semiuiuus he semede, And naked as a neelde and non help aboute hym. Faith on hym hadde furst a sight ac he fleih a-syde, And wolde nat neyhle hym by nyne londes lengthe. Hope cam hippyng after þat hadde so ybosted Hou he with moyses maundement hade meny men holpen; And whanne he hadde siht of þis sike asyde he gan drawe, And dredfulliche with-drow hym an dorste go no nerre. Ac as sone so þe samaritan hadde sighte of þat syke, He alyghte a-non of lyarde and ladde hym in hus hondes, And to þis wye he wente hus wondes to [be]holde. He perceyuede by his pous he was in peril to deye, And bote he hadde recouer þe raþer þat rise sholde he neuere. He vnbokelede hus boteles and boþe he a-tamede; With wyn and with oile hus wondes he can lithe; Enbaumede hym and bond hus heuede and on bayarde hym sette, And ledde hym forth to lauacrum lex-dei, a graunge, Is sixe myle oþer seuene by-syde þe newe markett, And lefte hym þere a lechinge to lyuen if he myghte. And took two pans to þe hosteler to take kepe to hym, “And þat goþ mor for hus medicine ich make þe good a?enwarde, For [ich] may nat lette,” quaþ [þat] lede and lyarde he bystrydeþ, And rapede hym to ryde þe righte wey to Ierusalem. Bothe faith and hus felawespes folweden faste after; Ac ich suwede þe samaritan and seide hou þei bothe Weren afered, and flowen fro þe man y-wonded. “Haue hem excused,” quaþ þe samaritan “here help wolde nat vaille, Ne medecine vnder molde þe man to hele brynge, Noþer Faith ne fyn hope so festered aren hus wondes; With-oute þe blod of [a] barn he beoþ nouht ysaued, The whiche barn mot neodes be bore of a mayde, And with þe blod of þat barn embaumed and baptized. And þauh he steppe and stande right strong worth he neuere Til he haue eten al þat barn and hus blod dronken, And ?ut be plastred with pacience when fondynges hym prykieþ— For wente neuere [man] þis way þat he ne was here rifled, Saue my-selue sothliche and suche as ich louede— And ?ut be-leyue leelly vpon þat litel baby, Þat his likame [schal] lechen atte laste ous alle.” “A! syre,” ich seide “shul nat we by-leyue, As faith and hus felawe spes enformede me boþe, In þre persones, a parceles departable from oþer, And all þre bote o god? þus abraham me tauhte. And hope afterwarde of god more me tolde, And lerede me for hus loue to louye al man-kynde, And hym abouen alle and hem as my-selue; Noþer lacky ne alose ne leyue þat þer were Eny wickeder in þis worlde þan y were myself, And most imparfit of alle persones and pacientliche suffre Alle manere of men and þauh ich myghte me venge, I sholde tholie and þonken hem þat me vuel wolde.” “He seide soth,” quaþ þe samaritan “and so ich rede þe also. And as abraam þe olde of o god þe taughte, Loke þow louye and by-leyue al þy lyf-tyme. And if kynde witt carpe her-a?en and oþer kynne þouhtes, Oþer heretikes with argumens þyn hond þou hem shewe! For god þat al by-gan in gynnynge of þe worlde, Ferde furst as a fust and ?ut is, as ich leyue, Mundum pugillo continens, As with a fust with o fynger yfolde to-gederes, Til hym liked and luste to vnlose þe fynger, And profrede hit forth as with þe paume to what place it sholde. The paume is þe piþ of þe honde and profreþ forþ þe fyngres, To mynystre and to make þat myght of hond knoweþ, And bytokneþ trewely telle ho so likeþ, The holy gost of heuene; he is as þe paume. The fyngres þat freo beo to folden and to clycchen By-tokneþ sothliche þe sone þat sente was tyl erthe, Touchede and tastede at techynge of þe paume, Seynte marie, a mayde and mankynde lauhte; Natus ex maria uirgine. The fader is þenne as þe fust with fynger and with paume, To huden and to holde as holy writ telleþ; Omnia traham ad me ipsum. Al þat þe fynger gropeþ graythly he grypeþ, Bote yf þat þat he gropeþ greue þe paume. Thus are thei alle bote on as hit an hande were, A fust with a fynger and a foll paume. And as þe fust is ful hand yfolde to-gederes, So is þe fader a ful god þe furste of hem alle. And as my fust is furst er ich my fyngers shewe, So is he fader an former þe furste of alle þynges; Tu fabricator omnium; And alle þe myghte with hym is was, and worth euere. Þe fyngres is ful hand for, failled thei here þombe, Portrey ne peynte parfitliche, ich leyue, Sholde no wry?t worche were he aweye. Ry?t so, faillede þe sone þe syre be ne myghte, Ne holde, ne helpe ne hente þat he louede; Dextre dei tu digitus. The paume is pureliche þe honde and haþ power by hym-self, Oþer-wise þan þe wrythen fust oþer werkmanshup of fyngres. For þe paume haþ power to putten oute þe Ioyntes, And to vnfolde þe fust for hym hit bylongeþ, And receyuen þat þe fyngres rechen and refuse, yf hym likeþ, Al þat þe fyngres and þe fust felen and touchen, Beo he greued with here gripe þe holy gost let falle. Thus is þe holigost god noþer grettoure ne lasse Thenne is þe syre oþer þe sone and of þe same myghte, And alle þre nys bote o god as my hand and my fyngres, Vnfolde oþer yfolde a fust-wyse oþer elles, Al is hit bote on hand hou so y turne hit. Ac ho so is hurt in þe hand euene in þe myddes, He may receyue ryght nouht reson hit sheweþ; For þe fyngeres þat folde sholden and þe fust make, For peyne of þe paume power [hem] failleþ To clucche oþer to clawe to cluppe oþer to holde. Were þe myddel of myn hand with-oute mal ese, In menye kynne manere ich myghte my-self helpe, Boþe meue and amende þauh alle my fyngres oken. By this simile,” he seide “ich seo an euidence, That ho so synegeþ in þe seynt espirit asoilled worth he neuere, Noþer her ne elles-wher as ich herde telle; Qui peccat in spiritum sanctum [neque remittetur ei,] &amp;c. He prikeþ god as in þe paume þat peccat in spiritum sanctum. For þe fader is as þe fust þe sone is as þe fyngres, The holy gost of heuene he is as þe paume. So ho so synegeþ a?ens þe seynte espirit hit semeþ þat he greueþ God, þer he gripeth and wolde hus grace quenche. For to a torche oþer to a taper the trinite is likened, As wexe and a weke [were twyned] to-gederes, And fuyr flaumed forth of hem boþe; And as wex and weke [and warm fuyr] to-gederes Fostren forþ a flaume and a fayre lye, That serueþ þese swynkeres to seo by a nyghtes, So doþ þe syre and þe sone and seynt espirit togederes, Fostren forth a-mong folke fyn loue and by-leyue, Þat alle kynne crystene clanseþ of synne. And as þou suxt some tyme sodenliche, of a torche Þe blase beo blowen out ?ut brenneþ þe weke, With-outen lye and lyght [lith] fuyr in þe macche, So is þe holy gost god and grace with-oute mercy To alle vnkynde creatures þat coueyten to distruye Leel lycame, and lif þat oure lorde shupte. And as glowynge gledes gladeþ nat þese workemen Þat worchen and waken in wynteres nyghtes, As doþa kyx oþer a candele þat cauht haþ fuyr, and blaseþ, No more doþ the syre ne þe sone ne seynte espirit togederes Graunten eny grace ne for-gyuenesse of synnes, Til þe holy gost by-gynne to glowen and blase. So þat þe holy gost gloweþ bote as a glede, Til þat loue and by-leyue leelliche to hym blowe. Thenne flammeþ he as fuyr on fader and onfilius, And melteþ myghte in-to mercy as we may seo a wynter, Isykles in euesynges thorgh hete of þe sonne Melteþ in a mynt-while to myst and to water; So grace of þe holy gost melteþ al to mercy, The grete myghte of þe trinite to mercyable, and to none oþere. And as wex wiþ-oute more vpon a warm glede Wol brennen and blasen beo thei to-gyderes, And solasen hem þat mowe nat seon syttyng in deorknesse, So wol þe fader for-?yuen folke of mylde hertes, That rufulliche repenten and restitucion maken, In as muche as þei mowen amenden and payen, And yf hit sufficith nat for a-seth þat in suche wille deyen, [Mercy, for his mekenesse wil make good þe remenant.] And [as] þe wicke and þe warme fuyr wol make a fayr flamme For to murthen men with þat in merke sytten; So wol crist, of hus curtesye and men crye hym mercy, Boþe for-?euen and for-?uten and ?ut bydde for ous To þe fader of heuene for-?yuenesse to haue. Ac hewe fuyr of a flynt four hundred wynter; Bote þou haue tache to take hit with tunder and broches, Al þy labour is lost and al þy long trauayl; For may no fuyr flamme make faille hit hus kynde. So is [þe] holigost god and grace with-oute mercy To alle vnkynde creatures as crist hym-self wittnesseþ; Amen dico uobis, nescio vos. Beo vnkynde to þyn emcrystene and al þat þow canst bidde, Dele and do penaunce day and nyght euere, And porchase al þe pardoun of paumpelon and of rome, And Indulgences ynowe and be ingrat to þy kynde, The holygost huyreþ [þe] nat ne helpeth þe, be thow certayn. For vnkyndenesse quencheþ hym þat he [can] nat shyne, Ne brenne, ne blase cleer for blowynge of vnkyndenesse. Seynt paul þe apostel proueþ wher ich lye; Si linguis hominum loquar, &amp;c. For-þi beoþ war, ?e wyse men þat with þe worlde deleþ, That ryche beon and reson knowen reuleþ wel ?oure soule. Beoþ nat vnkynde, ich consaile ?ou to ?oure emcristene. For menye of [?ow] ryche men by my saule, ich lye nat, ?e brenneþ, ac ?e blaseþ nat and þat is a blynde bekne; Non omnis qui dicit [michi] domine, domine, intrabit in regnum celorum. Mynne ?e nat, riche men to which a meschaunce Þat dives deyed, and dampned [was] for hus vnkyndenesse Of hus mete and of hus moneye to men þat hit neodede? ?ut wan he hit nat with wrang ne with queynte sleythes, Bote ry?tfulliche, as men [rat] al hus rychesse cam hym, And on hym-self, seith the book sotelede hou he myghte Most lordliche lyuen and leet hus lycame werie Cloþes of most cost as clerkes bereth wittnesse; Epulabatur splendide, &amp; induebatur bisso &amp; purpura. And for he was a nigard to þe neodful poure, For godes treitour he is tolde for al hus trewe catel, And dampned is and dwelleþ with þe deuel in helle. Suthþe he with-oute wiles wan and wel myghte atemye Lordliche for to lyuen and likyngliche be cloþed, And is in helle for al þat how wole riche nouthe Excuse hem þat beþ vnkynde and ?ut here catel wonne With wiles and with luther wittes and ?ut wollen nat atemye To gon semliche ne sitte sith holy writ techeþ, That þat wikkedliche is wonne to wasten hit, and to make frendes? Facite uobis amicos de mammona iniquitatis. Eche a riche man, ich rede reward her-of take, And ?eueþ ?oure good to þat god þat grace of ariseþ. For ?e þat ben vnhende to hyse hope ?e none oþer, Bote to dwelle þer dives dayes with-outen ende. Thus is vnkyndenesse [kid] and aquencheþ, as hit were, The grace of þe holygost godes owene kynde; For þat þat kynde doþ vnkynde for-doþ. Acorsede þeoues, vnkynde cristene men for couetise and enuye Sleeþ a man for hus meobles with mouth oþer with handes; For þat þe holy gost haþ to kepe suche harlotes destruyen, The whiche is lyf and loue the lye of mannes body. For euery maner good man may be lykned to a torche, Oþer elles [to] a taper to reuerence with þe trinite; And ho so morþereþ a good man me þynkeþ, [by] myn In-witt, He for-doþ þe light þat oure lorde lokeþ to haue worsshep of. And ?ut in mo maneres men offendeþ þe holy gost; Ac þis is þe worste wise þat eny wight myghte Synegen a-?ens þe seynt espirit assenten to destruye For couetyse of eny kynne þyng þat cryst dere boughte. How myghte he aske mercy oþer eny mercy hym defende, That wikkidliche and wilfulliche wolde mercy anyente? Innocence is next god and nyght and day hit cryeþ, ‘Veniaunce! veniaunce! for-?eue be hit neuere, That shende ous and shadde oure blod for-shupte ous, as hit semede; Vindica sanguinem iustorum!’ Thus ‘veniaunce! veniaunce!’ verray charite askeþ, And suthen charite, þat holychurche is chargeþ this so sore, Leyue ich neuere þat oure lorde atte laste ende Wol louye þat lyf þat loue and leel charite destruyen.” “Ich pose ich hadde syneged so,” quaþ ich “and shold nouthe deye, And now am ich sory þat ich so þe seynt espirit agulte, Confesse me and crye hus grace god þat al made, And myldeliche hus mercy aske myghte ich nat be saued?” “?us,” seide þe samaritan “so þou myghtest repente, That ryghtwisnesse þorgh repentaunce to reuthe myghte turne. Ac hit is bote selde seyn ther sothnesse bereþ wittnesse Eny creature be coupable by-for a kynges Iustice, Be yraunsoned for repentaunce þer al reson hym dampneþ. Ther þat partye porsueþ þe apeel is so huge, May no kynge mercy graunt til boþe men a-corden, Þat ayþer partye haue [equite] as holy writt witnesseþ; Nunquam dimittitur peccatum, &amp;c. Thus hit fareþ by suche folke þat folwen here owene wil, Þat vuel lyuen and leten nat til hem for-sake synne. Drede of desperacion þenne dryueþ a-wey grace, Þat mercy in here mynde may nat þenne falle; For good hope þat hem helpe sholde to [wanhope] turneþ, And nat of þe [nounpower] of god þat he nys ful of myghte To amenden al þat amys is and hus mercy grettour Than alle oure wikkede werkus as holy writ telleþ, Misericordia eius super omnia opera eius. Ac er hus rightwisnesse to reuthe turne restitucion hit makeþ; As sorwe of herte is satisfaccion for suche as may nat paye. Ac þre þynges þer beoþ þat doþ a man to sterte Out of his owene hous as holy writ sheweþ. That on is a wikkede wif þat wol nat be chasted; Hure fere fleeth fro huere for fere of huere tounge. And yf hus hous be vnheled and reyne [on] hus bedde, He sekeþ and sekeþ [til] he slepe drye. Ac when smoke and smorþre smyt in hus eyen, Hit doþ hym wors þan hus wyf oþer wete to slepe. For þorw smoke and smorþre smerteþ hus syghte, Tyl he be bler-eyed oþer blynde and þe borre in hus þrote, Koweþ and corseþ þat crist ?yue hym sorwe That sholde brynge yn bettere wode oþer blowe til hit brente. These þre þat ich telle of thus beoþ to vnderstonde; The wif is oure wikkede fleshe [þat] wol nat be chasted, For kynde clyueþ on hym euere to contrarie þe soule. And thauh he falle, he fynt skyles þat frelete hit made. And þat is lyghtliche for-?yue and for-?ute boþe To man, þat mercy askeþ and amende þenkeþ. Ac þe reyn þat reyneþ þer we reste sholde, Beoþ syknesses and oþer sorwes þat we suffren [ofte], As seynt paul þe apostel in hus pistles techeþ, Virtus in infirmitate perficitur. And þauh men maken muche deol in here angre, And beo inpacient in here penaunces pure reson knoweþ, That þei han cause to contrarien by kynde of here syknesse; And lightliche oure lorde at here lyues ende Haþ mercy of suche men þat vuel may suffrye. Ac þe smoke and þe smorþre þat smyt in oure eyen, Þat is couetise and vnkyndenesse which quencheþ godes mercy. For vnkyndnesse is contrarie of alle kynne reson; For þer ne is syk ne sory ne non so muche wrecche, Þat he ne may louye, and hym lyke and lene of hus herte Good wil, good worde boþe wusshen and wylnen Alle manere of men mercy and for-?euenesse, And louye hem yliche hym-sylf þat hus lyf a-mende. Ich may no lenger lette,” quaþ he and lyarde he prykede, And wente away as þe wynde and þer-with ich awakede. Hic explicit passus tercius de dobet. PASSUS XXI. (DO-BET IV.) Hic Incipit passus quartus de dobet. Wo-werie and wetschod wente ich forth after, As a recheles renke þat reccheþ nat of sorwe, And ?eode forþ lyke a lorell al my lyf tyme, Til ich wax wery of þis worlde and wilnede efte [to] slepe, And lenede me til lenten and longe tyme ich slepte. Of gurles and of gloria laus gretliche me dremede, And how osanna by org[o]ne olde [folk] songe. On was semblable to þe samaritan and somdel to peers plouhman, Barfot on an asse bak bootles cam prykye, With-oute spores oþer spere and sprakliche he lokede, As is þe kynde of a knyght þat comeþ to be doubed, To geten hus gilte spores and galoches y-co[u]ped, Then was faith in a fenestre and cryde, “a! filij dauid!” As doþ an heraud of armes when auntres comeþ to Iustes. Olde Iewes of ierusalem for ioye þei songen, Benedictus qui venit in nomine domini. Þenne ich fraynede [at] faith ‘what al þat fare bymente, And ho sholde iusten in ierusalem?’ “iesus,” he seide, “And fecche þat þe feond cleymeþ peers frut þe plouhman.” “Ys peers in þis place?” quaþ ich and he preynkte vpon me, “Liberum dei arbitrium,” quaþ he “for loue haþ vndertake That þis iesus of hus gentrise shal Iouste in peers Armes, In hus helme and [in] hus haberion humana natura; Þat crist be nat knowe for consummatus deus, In peeres plates þe plouhman this prykiere shal ryde; For no dint shal hym dere as in deitate patris.” “Ho shal Iouste with iesus,” quaþ ich “Iewes, oþer scrybes?” “Nay,” quaþ Faith, “bote þe feond and fals dom to deye.

Lyf seith þat he lyeþ and haþ leyde hus lyf to wedde, Þat for al þat deþ can do with-Inne þre dayes, To walke and fecche fro þe feonde peers frut þe plouhman, And legge [hyt] þer hym lykeþ and lucifer bynde, And [forbete and bringe adoun] bale [and] deþ for euere; O mors, ero mors tua!” Thenne cam pilatus with muche peuple sedens pro tribunali, To seo hou douhtiliche deþ sholde do and deme here beyer ryght. The Iuwes and þe iustices a?ens iesus þey were, And alle þe court cryede ‘crucifige’ lowde. Thenne put hym [forth] a pelour by-for pilat, and seyde, “Thys iesus of oure Iuwen temple Iapede and despisede, To for-don hit on a day and in þre dayes after Edefien hit efte newe— her he stant þat seyde hit— And ?ut make [hit] as muche in alle manere poyntes, Bothe as longe and as large aloft and a-grounde, And as wyde as hit euere was this we witnessen alle.” “Crucifige,” quaþ a kachepol “he can of wicche-crafte.” “Tolle, tolle,” quaþ anoþer and toke of kene þornes, And by-gan of a grene þorne a garlaunde to make, And sette hit sore [on] hus hefd and suthe seyde in enuye, “Aue, rabbi,” quaþ þat ribaud [and] reodes shotte at hus eyen:— And nailede hym with þre nayles naked on þe rode, And with a pole poyson putten to hus lippes, And [beden] hym drynke, hus deþ to lette and hus dayes lengthen; And seide, “yf he sothfast beo he wol hym-self helpen; And now, yf þow be criste godes sone of heuene, Come a-doune of þis rode and þenne wol we leyue That lyf þe louyeþ and wol nat lete þe deye.” “Consummatum est,” quaþ Crist and comsede for to sounye Pitousliche and paal as prison þat deyeþ; The lord of lyf and of light þo leyde hus eyen togederes. The day for drede þer-of with-drow and deork by-cam þe sonne; The wal of þe temple to-cleef euene a two peces; The hard roche al to-rof and ryght derk nyght [hit] semede; The erthe quook and quashte as hit quyke were, And dede men for þat deon comen oute of deope graues, And tolden why þat tempest so longe tyme durede. “For a byter bataile” þe dede bodye seyde, “Lyf and deþ in þis deorknesse her on for-doþ þat oþer, Ac shal no [wi?t] wite witerliche ho shal haue þe mastrye, Er soneday, a-boute sonne-rysynge” and sank with þat til erthe. Somme seiden he was godes sone þat so faire deyede; Vere filius dei erat iste: Some seiden, “he can of sorcerye good is þat we a-saye Wher he be ded oþer nat ded doun er he be take.” Two þeoues þer wer þat þoleden deþ þat tyme Vpon crois by-side crist so was þe comune lawe. Quikliche cam a cacchepol and craked a-two here legges, And here armes after of euerich of þo þeoues. Ac þer was no boye so bolde godes body to touche, For he was knyght and kynges sone kynde for-?af þat tyme Þat no boye hadde hardinesse hym to touche in deyinge. Ac þer cam forth a blynde knyght with [a] kene spere y-grounde, Hihte longeus, as þe lettere telleþ and longe hadde lore hus sight. By-fore pilat and oþer peuple in þe place he houede. Ac maugre hus meny teþ he was mad þat tyme To Iouste with iesus this blynde Iuwe longeus; For alle hij were vnhardy þat houede þer oþer stode, To touche hym oþer to tryne hym oþer to take hym doun and graue hym, Bote þis blynde bachelere þat bar hym þorw þe herte; The blood sprang doun by þe sper and vnsperrede þe knyghtes eyen. Tho fel þe knyght vpon knees and cryed iesu mercy, “A-?ens my wil hit was,” quaþ he “þat ich ?ow wonde made!” He syghede and seide “sore hit me for-þynkeþ, Of þe dede þat ich haue don ich do me in ?oure grace. My londe and my lycame at ?oure lykynge takeþ hit, And haue mercy on me, ryghtful Ihesu!” [and] ryght with þat he wepte. Thenne gan faith foully þe false Iewes to despisen, And calde hem ‘caytifs a-corsed’ for þis was a vil vilanye:— “Veniaunce is to ?ou falle þat makede þe blynde Beten hym þat was ded hit was a boyes dede!” [Þus faith bi-gon to fare wiþ þe false Iewes]— “Corsede caityfs! knyghthod was hit neuere To bete a body ybounde with eny bri?t wepne, Þe gree ?ut haþ he geten for alle hus grete wondes.

Now beoþ ?oure goode dayes don as daniel of ?ow telleþ, When crist with crois ouercam ?oure kyngdom shal to-cleue; Cum uenerit sanctus sanctorum, cessabit unctio uestra.” What for fere of þis ferly and of the false Iewes, Ich drow in þat deorknesse to descendit ad inferna, And þer ich seyh sothliche secundum scripturas, Out of þe west, as it were a wenche, as me þouhte, Cam walkynge in þe way to helleward he lokede. Mercy hihte þat mayde a mylde þyng with-alle, And a ful benygne burde and buxum of speche. Heore sustre, as hit semede cam softly walkynge Euene out of þe est and westwarde he þouhte, A comely creature and clene treuthe [he] hihte. For þe vertue þat here folwede afered was he neuere. Whan þeos maydenes metten mercy and treuthe, Ayþer axed of oþer of þis grete wonder, Of þe deone and deorknesse and how þe day [rowed], And whiche a light and a leom lay by-fore helle. “Ich haue ferly of þis fare in faith,” seide treuthe, “And am wendyng to wyte what þis wonder meneþ.” “Haue no meruayle þer-of,” quath mercy “murthe hit by-tokneþ. A mayde þat hatte Marie and moder with-oute felynge Of eny kynde of creature conceyuede þorw speche And grace of þe holygost waxe gret with childe, With-oute [wommanes] wem in-to þis worlde brouhte hym; And þat my tale is trewe ich take god to witnesse. Sutthen þis barn was ybore beoþ þritty wynter passed, Deyed and deþ þolede þis day a-boute mydday; That is þe cause of þis eclipse þat ouer-closeþ now þe sonne, In menynge þat man shal fro meorknesse beo drawe, The while þis light and þis leom shal Lucifer a-blende. For patriarkes and prophetes han prechede her-of ofte, That þyng þat tynt was þorw treo treo shal hit wynne, And þat þat deþ doun brouhte deþ shal releue.” “That þat þou tellest,” quaþ treuþe “is bote a tale of walterot! For adam and eue and abraham with oþere, Patriarkes and prophetes þat in peyne liggen, Leyf hit neuere þat ?on lyght hem a-lofte brynge, Ne haue hem out of helle; hold þy tonge, mercy, Hit is trufle þat þou tellest; ich, treuthe, wot þe sothe, That þyng þat ones was in helle out comeþ hit neuere. For iob þe parfit patriarke repreoueþ þy sawes, Quia in inferno nulla est redempcio.” Thenne mercy ful myldeliche mouþed þese wordes, “Þorgh experience,” quaþ heo “ich hope þei shulle be sauede. For venym for-doþ venym þer vecche ich euydence, That adam &amp; eue haue shullen bote. Of alle fretynge venymes þe vilest is þe scorpion; May no medecyne amende þe place þer he styngeþ, Til he be ded, ydo þer-to and þenne hit destroieþ The ferst venemoste thorgh vertu of hym-selue. And so shal this deþ for-do ich [dar] my lyf legge, Al þat deþ and þe deuel dude formest to eue. Ryght as þe gylour þorw gyle by-gylede man formest, So shal grace þat al by-gan make a good ende, And by-gyle þe gylour and þat is a good sleithe; Ars ut artem falleret.” “Now suffre we,” seide treuthe “ich seo, as me thynkeþ Out of þe nype of þe north nat ful fer hennes, Ryghtwisnesse come rennynge; reste we þe whyle; For he wot more þan we he was er we boþe.” “That is soth,” seide mercy “and ich seo her by southe, Wher comeþ pees pleyinge in pacience [y]cloþed. Loue heore haþ coueyted longe leyue ich non oþer Bote loue haue sent heore som lettere what þis light bymeneþ That ouere-houeþ helle þus; he shal ous telle.” Whenne pees, in pacience [y]cloþed aproched ayþer oþer, Ryghtwisnesse reuerencede pees in heore riche cloþinge, And prayede pees to tellen huere to what place he wolde, In heore gay garnemens wham he gladie þouhte? “My wil is to wende,” quaþ Pees “and wel-come hem alle, Þat meny day myghte ich nat seo for meorknesse of synne.

And crist haþ conuerted þe kynde of ryghtwisnesse In-to pees and pyte of hus pure grace. Lo, here þe patente!” quaþ pees “in pace in idipsum, And þat þis dede shal dure [dormiam et requiescam].” “Rauest þou?” quaþ ryghtwisnesse “oþer þou art ryght dronke! Leyuest þou þat ?on light vnlouke myghte helle, And saue mannes soule? suster, wene hit neuere! At þe begynnynge of þe worlde god gaf þe dom hymselue, Þat adam and eue and hus issue alle Sholden deye doun-ryht and dwelle in peyne euere, Yf þei touchede þe treo and of þe frut eten. Adam afterwarde a-?ens hus defense, Faste fret of þat frut and for-soke, as hit were, The leel loue of oure lorde and hus lore boþe, And folwede þat þe feonde tauhte and hus fleshes wil, A?ens reson and ryghtwysnesse; recorde þis with treuþe, That here peyne is perpetuel no preyere may hem helpe. For-thi let hem chewe as thei chose and chide we nat, susteres, For hit is a botles bale þe byte þat þei eten.” “And ich shal preye,” quaþ pees “here peyne mote haue ende, Þat here wo in-to wele wende mote atte laste. For hadde þei wist of no wo wele hadde þei nat knowe; For wot no [wight] what wele is þat neuere wo suffrede, Ne what is hot hunger þat hadde neuere defaute.

And after auntrede god hym-self and tok adams kynde, To wite what he hadde suffred in [þre] sondry places, Boþe in heuene and in erthe; and now to helle he þenkeþ, To wite what alle wo is þat wot of alle ioye; Omnia probate; quod bonum est tenete.

May no deþ þis lord dere ne no deoueles queyntise, And wher he wole, is hus wey; ac war hym of þe periles; Yf he reue me of my ryght he robbeþ me by mastrie. For by ryght and reson þe renkes þat beon here Body and soule beþ myne boþe good and ille.

And sutthe we han beo sesed seuene þowsend wynter, And neuere was þer-a?eyn and now wolde by-gynne, He were vnwrast of hus worde þat witnesse is of trewþe.” “That is soþ,” seide satan “bote ich me sore doute, For þow gete hem with gyle and hus gardyn breke, A-geyn hus loue and hus leue on hus londe ?eodest, Nat in forme of a feonde bote in forme of an Addre, And entisedest eue to ete by heore on, Ve soli!

And as þow by-gyledest godes ymage in goynge of an addre, So haþ god by-gyled ous alle in goynge of a wye.” “For god haþ go,” quaþ gobelyn “in a gome lyknesse This þritty wynter, as ich wene and went a-bowte and prechede. Ich haue asailid hym with synne and som tyme ich askede Wher he were god oþer godes sone he gaf me short answere.

Ich rede we fleo,” quaþ þe feond “faste alle hennes; For us were betere nat beo þan abyde in hus syghte. For thi lesynge[s], lucifer we loste furst our ioye, And out of heuene hider thi prude made ous falle; For we [leyuede] on þy lesinges þer losten we [oure] blysse.

A lytel ich ouer-lep for lesynges sake, Þat ich ne segge as ich seih suynge my teme!— For eft þat light bad vnlouke and lucifer answerede, “What lord art þu?” quaþ lucifer; a voys a-loud seyde, “The lord of myght and of [mayn] þat made alle þynges. Duke of þis dymme place a-non vndo þe ?ates, That crist mowe comen In þe kynges sone of heuene.” And wiþ þat breþ helle brake with alle beliales barres; For eny wye oþer warde wyde openede þe gates. Patriarkes and prophetes populus in tenebris, Songen with seint Iohan ecce agnus dei! Lucifer loke ne myghte so lyght him a-blente; And þo þat oure lord louede with þat lyght forth flowen. “Lo, me her,” quaþ oure lorde “lyf and soule bothe, For alle synful soules to saue oure beyere ryght. Myne þei were and of me ich may þe beter hem cleyme. Al-þauh reson recorde and ryght of my-selue, That yf þei eten þe appel alle sholden deye, Ich by-hihte hem nat here helle for euere. For þe dedliche synne þat þei duden thi deceite hit made; With gyle þow hem gete ageyn alle reson. For in my paleis paradis in persone of an Addere Falsliche [þou] fettest þere þat me by-fel to loke, By-glosedest hem and [by]gyledest hem and my gardyn breke, A-?eyns my loue and my leyue; þe olde lawe techeþ, þat gylours [be] by-gylid and in here gyle falle. And ho so hitteþ out a mannes eye oþer elles hus for-teþ, Oþere eny manere membre maymeþ oþer hurteþ, The same [sore] shal he haue þat enye so smyteþ; Dentem pro dente, &amp; oculum pro oculo. So lyf shal [lyf] lete þer lyf haþ lyf anyented, So þat lyf quyte lyf þe olde lawe hit askeþ. Ergo, soule shal soule quyte and synne to synne wende, And al þat man mys-dude ich, man, to amenden hit; And þat þat deþ for-dude [my] deþ to releuen, Boþe aquyte and aquykye þat was aqueynt þorw synne; And gyle be by-gyled thorgh grace atte laste, Ars ut artem falleret, &amp;c. So leyf hit nat, lucifer þat ich a-?eyns þe lawe Fecche here eny synful soule souereynliche by maistrie; Bot þorgh ryght and reson raunson here myne lige; Non ueni soluere legem, sed adimplere. So þat þorgh gyle was geten þorwe grace is now y-wonne. And as adam and alle þorw a treo deyden, Adam and alle þorgh a treo shal turne to lyue. And now by-gynneþ thi gyle a-gayn on þe turne, And my grace to growe ay wydder and wydder. The biternesse þat þow hast browe now brouk hit þyself; That art doctour of deþ drynk þat þow madest! For ich þat am lord of lyf loue is my drynke, And for þat drynke to-daye deyede, as hit semede; Ac ich wol drynke of no dich ne of no deop cleregie, Bote of comune coppes alle cristene soules; Ac þi drynke worth deþ and deop helle þy bolle. Ich fauht so, me fursteþ ?ut for mannes soule sake; Sicio. May no pyement ne pomade ne presiouse drynkes Moyste me to þe fulle ne my þurst slake, Til the vendage valle in þe vale of Iosaphat, And drynke ryght rype most Resurreccio mortuorum. Then shal ich come as a kyng with coroune and with angeles, And haue out of helle alle menne soules. Feondes and feondekenes by-for me shullen stande, And be at my byddyng at blysse oþer at peyne. Ac to beo merciable to man þenne my kynde askeþ; For we beoþ breþeren of blod ac nat in baptisme alle. Ac alle þat beoþ myn half-breþeren in blod and in baptisme Shal neuere eft in helle come beo he ones oute; Tibi soli peccaui, &amp; malum contra te feci, &amp;c. Hit is nat vsed on erthe to honge eny felones Ofter þan ones þauh þei weren treitours. And yf þe kyng of þe kyngdom come in þe tyme Ther a þeof þoly sholde deþ oþer Iuwise, Lawe wolde he ?eue hym lyf and he lokede on hym. And ich, þat am kynge ouer kynges shal come suche [a] tyme, Ther þat dom to þe deoþ [dampneþ] alle wyckede; And yf lawe wol ich loke on hem hit lyth in my grace, Wheþer þei deye oþer deye nat dude þei neuere so ille. Be hit eny þyng [dere abou?t] þe boldness of here synne, Ich may do mercy of my ryghtwisnesse and alle myne wordes trewe. For holy writ wole þat ich be awreke of hem þat wrouhte ille; As, nullum malum impunitum, &amp; nullum bonum irremuneratum. And so of alle wyckede ich wolle here take veniaunce, And ?ut my kynde, in my kene yre shal contrarie my wil— Domine, ne in furore tuo arguas me, neque in ira tua corripias me— To beo merciable to menye of my half-breþeren. For blod may seo blood boþe a-þurst and a-cale, Ac blod may nat seo blod blede, bote hym rewe. Audiui archana verba, que non licet homini loqui. Ac my ryghtwisnesse and my right shal regnen in helle, And mercy and mankynde by-for me in heuene. For ich were an vnkynde kynge bote ich my kyn holpe, And nameliche at suche a neode þat neodes help askeþ, Non intres in iudicium cum servo tuo, domine. Thus by lawe,” quaþ oure lord “lede ich wol fro hennes Alle þat ich louye and leyuede in my comynge. Ac for þe lesynge þat þow, lucifer lowe til eue, Þow shalt abygge bitere,” quaþ god and bond hym with cheynes. Astrot and alle oþere hudden hem in heornes, Thei dorst nat loken on oure lorde þe leste of hem alle, Bote [leten] hym leden forth which hym luste and leue whiche hym lykede. Mony hundrede of aungelis harpeden þo and songen, Culpat caro, purgat caro, regnat deus dei caro. Thenne pipede pees of poetes a note, “Clarior est solito post maxima nebula phebus; Post inimicitias clarior est et amor. After sharpest shoures,” quaþ pees “most sheene is þe sonne; Ys no weder warmer þan after watery cloudes, Noþer loue leuere ne leuere freondes, Þan after werre and wrake whanne loue and pees beon maistres.

For impossible is no þyng to hym þat is al-myghty.” “Þow seist soþ,” quaþ ryghtwisnesse and reuerentliche heo custe Pees, and pees heore per secula seculorum. Misericordia &amp; ueritas obuiauerunt sibi; Iusticia &amp; pax osculate sunt. Treuthe trompede þo, and song “Te deum laudamus.” And þen lutede loue In a lowd note, “Ecce quam bonum &amp; quam iocundum est, habitare fratres in unum!” Tyl þe day dawede these damseles daunsede, That men rang to þe resurreccioun and with þat ich awakede, And kallyd kytte my wyf and kalote my doughter, “A-rys, and go reuerence godes resurreccioun, And creop on kneos to þe croys and cusse hit for a Iuwel, And ryghtfullokest a relyk non riccher on erthe. For godes blesside body hit bar for oure bote, And hit a-fereþ þe feonde for such is þe myghte, May no grysliche gost glyde þer hit shadeweþ!” Hic explicit passus quartus et ultimus de dobet. Visio eiusdem Willelmi de Do-best. PASSUS XXII (DO-BEST I). Hic Incipit passus primus de dobest. Thus ich awakede and wrot what ich hadde dremed, And dyhte me derly and dude me to churche, To huyre holliche þe masse and be housled after. In myddes of þe masse þo men ?eden to offrynge, Ich fel eft-sones a slepe and sodeynliche me mette, That peers the plouhman was peynted al blody, And cam yn with a croys by-fore þe comune peuple, And ryght like in alle lymes to oure lord ihesu; And þenne calde ich conscience to kenne me þe soþe. “Is this ihesus þe Iouster?” quaþ ich “þat Iuwes duden to deþe, Oþer is hit peers plouhman? ho peynted hym so rede?” Quaþ conscience, and kneolede þo “þese aren cristes armes, Hus colours and hus cote-armure and he þat comeþ so blody, Hit is crist with his crois conquerour of crystine.” “Whi calle ?e him crist siþthen Iuwes cald hym ihesus? Patriarkes and prophetes propheciede by-fore, Þat alle kynne creatures sholden kneolen and bowen, A-non as men nempned þe name of God ihesu. Ergo is no name to þe name of ihesu, [Ne] non so neodful to nempne by nyghte ne by daye. For alle deorke deoueles dreden hit to huyre, And synful ben solacede and saued by þat name. And ?e callen hym crist for what cause, telleþ me? Is Crist more of myght and more worþiere name Than iesu oþer iesus þat al oure ioy come of?” “Thow knowest wel,” quaþ conscience “and þow conne reson, Þat knyght, kyng, conquerour may be o persone. To be cald a knyght is fair for men shal to hym kneole; To be cald a kyng is fairour for he may knyghtes make; And to be cald conquerour that comeþ of special grace, Of hardynesse of heorte and of hendeness [boþe], To make lordes of laddes of londe þat he wynneþ, And fre men foule þralles þat folwen nat hus lawes. The Iuwes þat weren gentel-men ihesu þei dispiseden, Boþe hus lore and hus lawe now aren þei lowe cheorles. As wide as þe worlde is wonyeþ þer none Bote vnder tribut and taillage as tikes and cheorles. And þo þat by-comen cristine by consail of þe baptist, Aren frankelayns and freo þorgh fullyng þat thei toke, And gentel-men with ihesu for ihesus was yfulled, And vp-on caluarie [on] croys [y-crouned] kyng of Iuwes. Hit by-comeþ for a kyng to kepen and defende, And conquerour of hus conqueste hus laies and hus large. So dude ihesus þe Iuwes he Iustifiede and tauhte hem The lawe of þe lykyng lyf þat laste shal euere; And fendede hem fro foule vueles feueres and fluxes, And fro feondes þat were in hem and false by-leyue. Þo was he ihesus of Iuwes cald gentel prophete, And kyng of here kyngdom and corone bar of þornes. And þo conquered he on croys as conquerour noble; Myght no deþ hym for-do ne adoun brynge, Þat he ne aros and regnede and rauesshede helle; And þo was he conquerour called of quyke and of dede. For he ?af adam and eue and oþer mo blisse, Þat longe hadde leye by-fore as luciferes cheorles; And tok lucifer þe loþliche þat lorde was of helle, And bond hym as he is bounde with bondes of yren. Ho was hardier þan he? hus heorte blode he shadde, To maken alle folk freo þat folwen hus lawe. And sutthe he ?af largeliche all hus leel lege Places in paradis at here partyng hennes, He may beo wel cald conquerour and þat is crist to mene. Ac þe cause whi he comeþ þus with croys and hus passion, Ys, to wissen ous þer-with þat when we beo tempted, Ther-with to fighten and fenden ous fro fallyng in-to synne, And seo by hus sorwe þat ho so loueþ ioye, To penaunce and to pouerte he mot putte hym-selue, And muche wo in þis worlde wilnen and suffren. Ac to carpe more of crist and how he cam to þat name, Faithly for to speke hus furste name was ihesus. Tho he was bore in bethleem as þe book telleþ, And cam to take mankynde kynges and aungeles Reuerencede hym ryght faire with richesse of eorthe. Aungeles of heuene comen kneolede and songen, Gloria in excelsis deo. Kynges comen after kneolede and offride Muche gold and murre with-oute mercy askynge, Oþer eny kynne catel bote knewelechede hym souereyn Boþe of sand, sonne, and see and sitthen þei wente In-to here kyngene kutthe by counsail of aungeles, And þer was þat word fulfild the which thou of speke; Omnia celestia, terrestria, flectantur in hoc nomine ihesu. For alle þe aungeles of heuene at hus burthe kneolede, And al [þe] wit of þe worlde was in þo þre kynges; Reson and [ryghtwisnesse] and reuthe þei offrede; Where-fore and whi wise men þat tyme, Maistres and lettred men magi hem calde. That on kynge cam with reson keuered vnder sense; The secounde kyng sitthen sothliche he offrede Ryghtwisnesse, vnder red gold resones felawe. Gold is likned to leaute þat laste shal euere, And reson to ryche gold to right and to treuthe. The þridde kynge cam þo and kneolede to iesu, And presentide hym with pite aperynge by mirre; For mirre is mercy to mene and mylde speche of tonge. Eorthliche honeste þynges was offred þus at ones Þorgh þre kynde kynges kneolyng to ihesu. Ac for alle þese preciose presentes oure lord [prince] ihesus Was noþer kyng ne conquerour til he comsede wexe In þe manere of [a] man and þat by muche sleithe, As hit by-comeþ for a conquerour to conne menye sleithes, And menye wiles and wyt þat wol be a ledere; And so dude ihesus in hus dayes ho so dorste tellen hit. Som tyme he suffrede and som tyme he hidde hym, And som tyme he fauhte faste and fleih oþer-while; And som tyme [he] gaf good and grauntede hele, Boþe lyf and lyme as hym luste, he wrouhte; As [kynde] is of a conquerour so comsede ihesus, Til he hadde alle hem þat he for bledde. In hus Iuuente þis Ihesus at [þe] Iuwene feste Turned water in-to wyn as holy writ telleþ, And þer by-gan god of hus grace gretliche to dowel. For wyn is lykned to lawe and lyf-holynesse; And lawe lackede þo for men louede nat here enemy[s]; And crist counsaileþ thus and comaundeþ boþe To lerede and to lewede for to loue oure enemys. So at þat feste furst as ich by-fore tolde, By-gan God of hus grace and of hus goodness [to] do-wel; And þo was he cleped and cald nat onliche crist, bote ihesu, A fauntekyn ful of wytt filius Marie. For by-fore hus moder Marie made he þat wonder, That sheo furst and formest sholde ferme by-leyue, That he thorgh grace was gete and of no gome elles. He wrouhte þat by no wyt bote by worde one, After þe kynde þat he cam of þer comsede he dowel. And whenne he was woxen more in hus modres absence, He made lame to leepe and ?af light to blynd, And fedde with two fisshes and with fyue loues [Sore] a-fyngred fele folke mo þan fyf þousand. Thus he comfortede careful and cauhte a grettere name, The whiche was dobet wher þat he wente. For deue þorgh hus doynges and dombe speke and herde, And alle he heled and halp þat hym of grace askyde. Tho he was callyd in þe contreo of þe comune peuple For þe dedes þat he dude fili david, iesus! For dauid was þe douhtiest of dedus in hus tyme; The buyrdes [þo] songen saul interfecit mille, &amp; dauid decem milia; For-þi þe contreye þer ihesu cam cald hym fili dauid, Nempnede hym of nazareth and no man so worthi To beo caiser oþer kyng of þe kyngdom of Iuda, Ne ouer Iuwes Iustice as ihesus [was], hem þouhte. Her-of had cayfas enuye and oþere Iuwes, And for to do hym to deþe day and nyght þei casten, And culled hym on croys-wyse at caluarye, on a fryday, And sutthen buriede hus body and beden þat men sholde Kepen hit fro nyght-commeres with kyghtes y-armed, For no freonde sholde hit fecche for prophetes hem tolde That þat blessed body of buriels sholde aryse, And gon in-to galile and gladen hus apostoles, And hus moder Marie; thus me by-fore deuynede. The knyghtes that kepten hit by-knewen hem-selue, Þat aungeles [&amp;] archaungeles ar þe day spronge, Comen kneolynge to þat corps, and songen, ‘Christus rex resurgens’ and hit aros after, Verrei man by-fore hem alle and forþ with hem ?eode. The Iuwes preyede hem of pees and preyede þo knyghtes Telle þe comune, þat þer cam a companye of hus aposteles, And by-wicched hem as thei woke and a-way stelyn hit. Ac marie magdalene mette [him] by þe weye, Goynge to-ward galile in god-hede and man-hede, And lyues and lokynge and heo aloud cryede, In eche companye þer heo cam ‘christus resurgens.’ Thus cam hit out þat crist ouer-cam rekeouered, and lyuede; Sic oportet Christum pati, &amp; intrare gloriam suam, For þat [þat] wommen witeþ may nat wel be consail! Peter parceyuede al þis and porsuede after, Boþe Iames and Iohan Ihesu to seke, Taddee and ten mo with thomas of ynde; And [as] alle þese wise wyes weren to-gederes In an hous al by-shutt and here dore barred, Crist cam yn, and al was closed boþe dore and ?ates, To peter and to hus aposteles and seyde, ‘pax uobis!’ And took thomas by þe hand and tauhte hym [to grope] And fele with hus fyngres hus fleshliche heorte. Thomas touchede hit and with hus tunge seyde, ‘Dominus meus &amp; deus meus, Thow art my lord, ich by-leyue god, lord ihesu, That deydest and deþ þoledest and deme shalt ous alle, And now art lyuynge and lokynge and laste shalt euere.’ Crist carpede þenne and corteisliche seide, ‘Thomas, for thou trowest this and trewely by-leyuest hit, Yblessed mote þou beo and beo shalt for euere; And blessed moten þei beo in body and in soule, Þat neuere shullen seo in syht as þou seost nouthe, And leelly by-leyuen al this ich loue hem and blesse hem; Beati qui non uiderunt, &amp; crediderunt.’ And when þis dede was don dobest he þouhte, And ?af peers power and pardon he grauntede To alle manere of men mercy and for?yuenesse, And ?af hym myghte to asoylye men of alle manere synnes, In couenaunt þat þei come and kneweliched to paye To peers pardon [þe] plouhman Redde quod debes. Thus haueþ peers power beo hus pardon payed, To bynde and vnbynde bothe here and elleswher, And assoille of alle synnes saue of dette one. A-non after an hyh vp in-to heuene He wente, and woneþ þere and wol come atte laste, And rewardy [him] right wel þat Reddit quod debet, Payeþ now parfitliche as pure treuthe wolde. And what persone payeþ hit nat punysshen he þenkeþ, And demen [hem] at domesday boþe quyke and dede; The gode to þe god-hede and to grete ioye, And wyckede to wonye in wo with-outen ende.” Thus conscience of crist and of þe croys carpede, And consailede me to kneole þer-to And þenne cam, me þouhte, On spiritus paraclitus to peers and to hus felawes, In liknesse of a lyght[n]ynge a-lyghte on hem alle, And made hem [conne] and knowe alle kynne languages. Ich wondrede what þat was and waggede conscience, And was a-fered for þe lyght for in fuyres lyknesse Spiritus paraclitus ouer-spradde hem alle. Quaþ conscience tho, and kneolede “this is cristes messager, And comeþ fro þe grete god grace is hus name. Kneole now,” quaþ conscience “and yf þow conne synge, Welcome hym and worshupe hym with ‘veni, creator spiritus.’” And ich sang þat song þo and so dude meny hondred, And cryden with conscience “help ous, god of grace!” Tho by-gan grace to go with peers the plouhman, And consailede hym and conscience the comune to someny— “For ich wolle dele to day and diuyde grace To alle kynne creatures þat can hus fif wittes; Tresour to lyue by to here lyues ende, And wepne to fight with þat wol neuere faille. For antecrist and hise shal al þe worlde greue, And encombry þe, conscience bote yf crist þe helpe. And fele false prophetes flaterers and glosers Shullen come, and be curatours ouer kynges and Erles. Thanne shal pruyde be pope and pryns of holychurche, Couetise and vnkyndenesse cardinales hym to lede. For-þi,” quaþ grace, “ar ich go ich wole gyue ?ou tresour, And wepne to fyghte with whanne antecrist ?ou assaileþ.” And gaf ech man a grace to gye with hym-self, Þat ydelnesse ne encombre hem nat ne enuye, ne pruyde; Diuisiones graciarum sunt. To somme men he ?af wit [wiþ] wordes to shewe, To wynne with truthe þat þe worlde askeþ, As preostes and prechours and prentises of lawe, Thei to lyue leelly by labour of tounge, And by wit to wyssen oþere as grace wolde hem teche. And somme he kende craftes and connynge of syghte, With syllynge and byggynge here by-lyue to wynne. And somme he lerede to laboure a londe and a watere, And lyue by þat labour a leel lyf and [a] trewe. And somme he tauhte [to] tulye to theche and to coke, As here wit wold when the tyme come. And somme to dyuyne and dyuyde numbres to kenne, And [craftely] to compassen and colours to make. And somme to seo and to seye what sholde by-falle Bothe of wele and of wo and be war by-fore, As astronomyens þorw astronomye and philosophers wise. And somme to ryde and rekeuere þat vnryghtfulliche was wonne; He wissede men wynnen hit a?eyn þorgh wyghtnesse of handes, And fecchen hit fro false men with foleuyles lawes. And somme he lerede to lyue in longynge to be hennes, In pouerte and in pacience to preye for alle crystyne. And alle he lerede to beo leell and eche a craft loue oþere, Nother bost ne debat beo among hem alle. “Thauh somme be clannere þan some ?e seon wel,” quaþ grace, “That alle craft and connynge cam of my ?yfte. Loke þat non lacken oþer bote louye as breþeren, And he þat most maistries can beo myldest of berynge. And coroneþ conscience kyng and makeþ craft ?owre stywarde, And after craftes consail cloþeþ ?ow and fedeþ. For ich make peers plouhman my procuratour and my reue, And registrer to receyuen redde quod debes. My prower and my plouhman peers shal beo on erthe; And for to tulye treuthe a teome shal he haue.” Grace gaf to peers a teome of foure grete oxen; That on was luc, a large beest and a louh-chered, Marc, and matheu þe þirde myghty beestes boþe; And Ioyned til hem on Iohan most gentil of alle, The prys neet of peers plouh passynge alle oþere. And sutthe grace of hus goodnesse gaf peers foure stottes, Al þat hus oxen ereden thei to harwen after. On hihte austyn and ambrosie anoþer, Gregori the grete clerk and Ierom þe goode. Theose foure, the faith to teche folwede peers teom, And harowede in an hand-whyle al holy scripture, With to eythes þat thei hadden an olde and a newe; Vetus testamentum et nouum. And grace gaf to peers greynes cardinales uertues, And sewe hit in mannes soule and sitthen he tolde here names. Spiritus prudencie þe furste sed hihte; Þat ho so eet þat seed ymagenye he sholde, Er he dude eny dede deuyse wel þe ende; And lerede men a ladel bygge with a long stele, That cast for to kele a crokke and saue þe fatte aboue. The secunde seed highte spiritus temperancie; He þat eet of þat seed hadde suche a kynde, Sholde neuere mete ne myschief make hym [to] swelle; Ne sholde no scornere out of skyle hym brynge, Noþer wynnynge, ne welthe of worldliche richesse, Wast word, ne ydelnesse ne wyckede speche meoue. Sholde no curiouse cloþe come on hus rygge, Noþer mete in hus mouthe þat maister Iohan spicede. The þrydde seod þat peers sewe was spiritus fortitudinis; And ho so eet of þat seed hardy was he euere To suffren al þat god sente syknesses and angres; Myghte no lyere with lesynges ne loos of wordly catell Make hym for eny mournyng þat he ne was mury in soule, And bold of a-bydyng busemares to suffren, And plede with pacience and parce michi, domine; And keouered hym vnder consail of caton þe wise, Esto forti animo cum sis dampnatus inique. The furthe seed þat peers sewe was [spiritus iusticie]; And he þat eet of þat seed sholde be [euere] trewe With god, and nat a-gast bote of gyle one. For gyle goþ so priuely þat good faithe oþer-whyle May nat be aspied þorw spiritus iusticie. Spiritus iusticie spareþ nat to spille Hem þat beoþ gulty and for to corecte The kyng, and þe kyng falle in eny þynge gulty. For counteþ he no kynges wraþthe when he in court sytteþ To deme as a domesman; adrad was he neuere, Noþer of duk ne of deþ þat he ne doþ þe lawe. For present oþer for preyoure oþere eny princes letteres, He dude equyte to alle euene-forth hus knowynge. Theese foure seedes peeres sewe and sutthen he dude hem harwen With olde lawe and newe lawe þat loue myghte wexe Amonge þese foure vertues and vices destruyen. For comunliche in contreies cammokes and weodes Fouleþ þe frut in þe felde þer þei growen to-gederes; And so doþ vices vertues “and for-thi,” quaþ peers, “Harweþ alle þat conneþ kynde wit by counsail of theose doctours, And tulyeþ after here techynge þe cardinale vertues.” “A?eynst þat þi greynes,” quaþ grace “bygynneþ to growe, Ordeyne þe an hous, peers to herberghen in thi cornes.” “By [god], grace,” quaþ peers “?e mote gyue me tymber, And ordeyne þat hous er ?e hennes wende.” And grace gaf hym þe croys with þe corone of þornes, Þat crist vp-on caluarie for mankynde on peynede; And of hus baptisme and blod þat he bledde on rode He made a maner morter and mercy hit hihte. And þer-with grace by-gan to make a good foundement, And watelide hit and wallyde hit with hus peynes and hus passion, And of alle holy writt he made a roof after, And cald þat hous vnite holychurche in englishe. And whanne þis dede was don grace deuysede A cart, hihte cristendome to carien home peers sheues; And gaf hym capeles to hus cart contricion with confession, And made preosthood haiwarde the while hym-self wente As wide as þe worlde is with peers to tulye treuthe, And þe londe of by-leyue þe lawe of holychurche. Now is peeres to þe plouh; pruyde hit aspide, And gadered hym a gret ost greuen he þenkeþ Conscience, and alle cristene and cardinale uertues, To blowen hem doun and breken hem and bite a-two þe rotes; And sente forþ sourquidours hus seriauns of armes, And hus aspie spille-loue on speke-vuel-by-hynde. These to-comen to conscience and to cristyne peuple, And tolden hem tydynges “þat tyne þey sholde The seedes þat syre peers sewe þe cardinale uertues; And peers bern worth to-broke and þei þat ben in vnite Shullen come out, and conscience and ?owre two capeles, Contricion and confession and ?oure cart bi-leyue Shal be colered so queyntely and keouered vnder oure sophistrie, That conscience shal nat knowe by contricion, Noþer by confession ho is cristyne oþer heþene, Ne no manere marchaunt þat with monye deleþ, [Wheþer] he wynne with right with wrang, oþer with vsure. With suche colour and queyntise comeþ pruyde [y]-armed, With þe lord þat lyueþ after þe lust of hus bodye, To wasten, in welfare and in wickede kepynge, Al þe worlde in a while þorugh oure wit,” quaþ pruyde. Quaþ conscience to alle crystyne tho “my consail is, we wende Hastiliche in-to vnite and holde we ous þere; Preye we þat a pees were in peers bern þe plouhman. For wyterly ich wot wel we beoþ nat of strengthe To go a-gayn pruyde bote grace with ous were.” And þenne cam kynde wit conscience to teche; He criede, and comaundede alle cristyne people To delue and dike a deop diche al aboute vnite, Þat holychurche stod in holynesse as hit were a pile. Conscience comaundede þo alle crystyne to delue, And make a muche mot þat myghte be a strengthe, To helpe holychurche and hem þat hit kepeþ. Thenne alle kynne crystyne saue comune wommen, Repentede and refusede synne saue thei one; And [a sisour] and a somenour þat weren for-swore ofte, Witynge and wilfulliche with þe false þei helden, And for seluere were for-swore sothly þei wisten hit. Ther ne was cristyne creature þat kynde wit hadde, Þat he ne halp a quantyte holynesse [to] wexe; Some by bedes byddyng and somme by pilgrimages, Oþer oþere pryueie penaunces and somme þorw pansdelynge. And þenne water wellede for wyckede werkes, Egreliche ?ernynge out of mennys eyen. Clannesse of the comune and clerkes clene lyuynge Made unite holychurche in holynesse stonde. “Ich care nat,” quaþ conscience “thauh pruyde come nouthe, The lord of lust shal beo lett al þis lente, ich hope. Comeþ now,” quaþ conscience “?e cristyne, and dyneþ, Þat han labored leelly al þis lente tyme. Her is bred yblessid and godes body þer-vnder. Grace gaf þorw godes worde to peers plouhman power And myghte to maken hit and men for to eten hit, In help of here hele ones in a monthe, Oþer as ofte as thei hadde neode thei that hadden payed To peers pardon [þe] plouhman Redde quod debes.” “How?” quaþ alle þe comune “consailest thou ous to ?elde Al þat we owen eny wyght er we go to housele?” “That is my consail,” quath conscience “and cardinale vertues, [Þat iche man for?iue oþer &amp; þat wile þe pater-noster]; Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut &amp; nos [dimittimus], &amp;c.: And so to beo asoilled and sytthen beo housled.” “?e, bawe!” quaþ a brewere “ich wol nat beo rueled, By iesu! for al ?oure iangelynge after spiritus iusticie, Ne after conscience, by crist for ich couþe selle Boþe dregges and draf and drawe at one hole Thicke ale and þynne ale and þat is my kynde, And nat to hacke after holynesse; hold þy tonge, conscience! Of spiritus iusticie þow spekest muche an ydel!” “Caitif,” quaþ conscience “corsede wreche! Unblessed art þow, brewere bote yf god þe helpe; Bote þow lyue by þe lore of spiritus iusticie, The chef seede þat peers sewe saued worst þow neuere. Bote conscience þe comune fede and cardinale vertues, Leyf hit wel, we beon lost boþe lyf and soule.” “Then is meny man ylost” quaþ a lewede vicory; “Ich am a curatoure of holy[kirke] and cam neuere in my tyme Man to me, þat couthe telle of cardinale uertues, Oþer þat acountede conscience a cockes feþer oþer an hennes! Ich knew neuere cardinal þat he ne cam fro þe pope, And we clerkes, when thei comeþ for here comunes payeþ, For here pelure and palfrayes mete and pylours þat hem folwen. The comune clamat cotidie eche man to oþere, ‘The countrey is þe corsedour þer cardinales comeþ ynne; And ther thei liggen and lengen most lecherie þer regneþ:’— For-þi,” quaþ þis vicory “by verrai god, ich wolde Þat no cardinal come a-mong þe comune peuple, Bote in here holinesse [holden] hem stille At Auenoun, a-mong Iuwes cum sancto sanctus eris, &amp;c., Oþer in rome, as here ruwele wolde þe relikes to kepe; And thow, conscience, in kynges court and sholdest neuere [come] þennes, And grace þat thou so gredest of were gyour of alle clerkes, And peers with hus newe plouh and his olde boþe Emperour of alle þe worlde þat alle men were crystyne! Imparfit is þe pope þat al þe peuple sholde helpe, And soudeþ hem þat sleeþ suche as he sholde saue; Ac wel worthe peers plouhman þat porsueþ god in doynge, Qui pluit super iustos &amp; iniustos at ones, And sent þe sonne to saue a corsed mannes tulthe, As bryght as to þe beste man oþer to þe beste womman. Ryght so peers plouhman peyneþ hym to tulye As wel for a wastour oþer for a wenche atte stuwes, As for hym-self and his seruauns saue he is furst yserued; So blessed beo peers plouhman þat peyneþ hym to tulie, And trauaileþ and tuleþ for a tretour al-so sore As for a trewe tydy man alle tymes [y]lyke. And worsheped be [he] þat wrouhte al boþe good and wykke, And [suffreþ] hem þat synful beon til tyme þat thei repenten. And god amende þe pope þat pileþ holichurche, And cleymeþ by-fore þe kyng to beo kepere ouere cristyne, And counteþ no?t þauh cristene men be culled and robbed, And fyndeþ folke to fighte and cristene blod to spille, A?eyn þe lawe boþe old and newe as luk bereþ wittnesse, Non occides: [Et alibi], Michi uindictam, [&amp; ego retribuam].

And crist of hus cortesye þe cardinales saue, And turne here wit to wisedom and welþe for þe soule! For þe comune,” quaþ þis curatour “counten ful litel The consail of conscience oþer cardinale uertues, Bote hit soune as by syght som what to wynnynge; Of gile ne of gabbynge gyueþ þei neuere tale.

Hic explicit passus primus de dobest. PASSUS XXIII. (DO-BEST II.) Hic Incipit passus secundus de dobest. And as ich wente by þe waye when ich was þus awaked, Heuy-chered ich ?eode and elynge in heorte; For ich ne wiste wher to ete ne in what place. And [hit] neyhede ny þe noon and with neode ich mette, That afrontede me foule and faitour me calde. “Couþest þou nat excuse þe,” he seide “as dude þe kyng and oþere, That þou toke to lyue by to sustinaunce and cloþes, As by techinge and tellynge of spiritus temperancie, And þat þow nome no more þan neode þe tauhte? Neode haþ no lawe ne neuere shal falle in dette For þre þynges þat he takeþ hus lyf for to saue; That is, mete, whanne men hym werneþ for he no monye weldeþ, And wot þat non wol be hus borgh noþer haþ wed to legge; And he cacche in þat cas and come þer-to by sleithe, Soþeliche he syneweþ nat þat so wynneþ hus fode. And þauh he come so to [a] cloþ and can no betere cheuesaunce, Neode nymeþ hym a-non vnder hus mayn-pryse.

So Neode at grete neode may nyme as for hus owene, With-oute consail of conscience or cardinale uertues, So þat he suwe and saue spiritus temperancie. For is no vertue by-fore to spiritus temperancie, Noþer spiritus iusticie ne spiritus fortitudinis. For spiritus fortitudinis forfeteþ ful ofte, He shal do more þan mesure meny tyme and ofte, And bete men ouere bittere and som body to lyte, And greue men grettour þan good faith wolde. And spiritus iusticie shal Iugen, wol he, nul he, After þe kynges counsaile and þe comune lyke. And spiritus prudencie in menye poynt shal fayle Of þat he weneþ wolde falle yf his wit ne were. Wenynge is no wisedome ne wys ymaginacion, Homo proponit, deus disponit god gouerneþ alle goode vertues. Next hym is neode for a-non he meokeþ, And is as louh as a lomb for lackynge of þat hym neodeþ; For neode makeþ neody for neode louh-herted. Filosofres for-soken welthe for þei wolde be neody, And wonede wel elyngliche and wolden nat be riche. And god al hus grete ioye gostliche he lefte, And cam and took man-kynde and by-cam ful neody. He was so neody, seith þe bok in meny sondry places, Þat he seide in hus sorwe on þe selue rode, ‘Boþe fox and fowel may fleo to hole and crepe, And þe fisshe haþ fynnes to flete with to reste, Þer neode haþ ynome me so þat ich mot neode abyde, And suffre sorwes soure þat shal to ioye turne.’ For-þi beo nat a-basshed to bydde and to beo neody, Sithe he þat wrouhte al þe worlde was wilfulliche neody; Neuere non so neody ne non so poure deyede.” When neode hadde vnder-nome me thus a-non ich fel a sleope, And mette ful merueilousliche þat, in a mannes forme, Antecrist cam þenne and al þe crop of treuthe Turned tyte vp-so-doun and ouer-tilte þe rote, And made fals to springe and sprede and [spede] menne neodes. In eche contreie þer he cam he cutte away treuthe, And gert gyle growe þer as he a god were. Freres folweden þat feonde for [he ?af] hem copes, And religiouse reuerencede hym and rongen here belles; Al þe couent þo cam to welcome [þat] tyraunt, And alle hise as wel as hym saue onliche fooles; The whiche fooles weren gladdere to deye Þan lyue lengoure, suþe leaute was so rebuked. And a fals feond anticrist ouer alle folke regnede, That were mylde men and holye þat no meschief dradden, Defieden al falsnesse and folk þat hit vsede; And what kyng comfortede hem knowynge here gyle, Thei corsede and here consail were hit clerk oþer lewede. Anticrist thus sone hadde hundredes at hus baner, And pruyde bar þat baner boldeliche aboute, With a lorde þat lyueþ after lykynge of hus body, And cam a-?eyns conscience þat keper was an gyour Ouer kynde cristyne and cardinale uertues. “Ich consail,” quaþ conscience þo “comeþ with me, ?e fooles, In-to unite holichurche and halde we ous þere. And crye we to kynde þat he come and defende Ous fooles fro þe feondes lymes for peers loue þe plouhman. And crye we on al þe comune þat þei come to unite, Ther to abyde and bykere a?eyns beliales children.” Kynde huyrde þo conscience and cam out of þe planetes, And sente forþ his [foreyours] feuers and fluxes, Couhes and cardiacles [crampes] and toþ-aches, Reumes and Radegoundes and roynouse scabbes, Bules and bocches and brennyng Aguwes; Frenesyes and foule vueles these foragers of kynde Hadden pryked and preyed polles of people; Largeliche a legion lees þe lyf sone. Ther was—“harow and help! her comeþ kynde, With deþ þat is dredful to vn-do ous alle!” The lord þat lyuede after lust þo aloud criede After comfort, a knyght to come and bere hus baner. “Alarme! Alarme!” quaþ þat lorde “eche lyf kepe hus owene.” Thenne mette þese men er mynstrales myghte pipe, And er heraudes of armes hadden discriued lordes. Elde þe hore was in þe vaunt-warde, And bar [þe] baner by-fore deþ by right he hit claymede. Kynde cam after hym with menye kynne sores, As pockes and pestilences and muche people shente; So kynde þorgh corupcions culde ful menye. Deþ cam [dryuyng] after and al to douste [paschte] Kynges and knyghtes caysers and popes; Lered ne lewide he lefte no man stande; That he hitte euene sterede neuere after. Many a [louely] lady and here lemmanes knyghtes Sounede and swelte for sorwe of deþes dyntes. Conscience of hus cortesie þo kynde he by-souhte To cessen and to suffren and seo wher þei wolde Leue pruyde pryueliche and beo parfit cristene. And kynde cessede tho to seon þe peuple amende. Fortune gan flaterie þenne thaym fewe þat were a-lyue, And by-hyght [hem] long lyf and lecherie he sente Amonges alle manere men wedded and vnwedded, And gaderede a gret ost al ageyn conscience. This lecherie leyde on with lauhynge chere, And with pryuey speche and peyntede wordes, And armede hym [in] ydelnesse and in hy beryng. He bar a bowe in hus honde and manye brode arwes, Were fetherede with faire by-heste and many a fals treuthe. With vntidy tales he teonede ful ofte Conscience and hus companye of holy churche þe techers. Thenne cam couetise and caste how he myghte Ouercome conscience and cardinale uertues, And armed hym in auarice and hungriliche lyuede. Hus wepne was al wiles to wynne and to huyden; With glosynges and with gabbyngs he [gylede] þe peuple. Symonye hym sewede to assaile conscience, And pressede on þe pope and prelates thei maden, To holde with Antecrist here temporalite to saue; And cam to kynges consail as a kene baroun, And knockede conscience In court by-fore hem alle, And gerte goode faith to flee and fals to a-byde, And baldeliche bar adoun with meny a bryght noble Muche of þe wit and wisdom of westmynster halle. He iogged til a iustice and iousted in hus ere, And ouertulte al hus treuthe with ‘tak-this-on-amendement.’ And to þe arches in haste he hyede a-non after, And turnede cyuyle in-to symonye and suth he tok þe official; And for a menyuer mantel he made leel matrimonye Departe er deþ come and a deuors shupte. “Alas!” quaþ conscience, and cride “wolde crist, of hus grace, That couetise were cristyne þat is so kene to fyghte, And bold and [abydynge þe] while hus bagge lasteþ.” And þanne lowh loude lyf and let dagge hus cloþes, And armyd hym in haste in harlotes wordes, And held holynesse a Iape and hendynesse a wastour, And let leaute a cherl and lyere a freo man; Conscience and consail he countede [hit a] folye. Thus relyede lyf for a litel fortune, And prykeþ forth with pruyde preyseþ he no vertue, Ne careþ nouht hou kynde slouh and shal come atte laste, And culle alle erthly creatures saue concience one. Lyf tho leep asyde and lauhte hym a lemman, “Hele and ich,” quaþ he “and hihnesse of herte Shal do þe nat drede neiþer deþ ne elde, And [to for-?ete] ?outhe and ?yue nauht of synne.” This likede lyf and fortune hus lemman, And geten in here glorie a gadelyng atte laste, On þat muche wo wrouhte sleuthe was hus name. Sleuthe wax wonder ?erne and sone was of age, And wedded on wanhope a wenche of þe stewes; Here syre was a sysour þat neuere swor treuthe, On [tomme] two-tounged ateynt at eche enqueste. This sleuthe was sleyh of werre and a slynge made, And þrew drede of dispayr a doseyne myle a-aboute. For care conscience [þo] cryede vp-on elde, And bad hym fonde to fighte and afere wanhope. And elde hente good hope and hastiliche shrof hym, And wayueþ away wanhope and with lyf he fighteþ. And lif fleyh for fere to [fisik] after helpe, And by-souhte hym of socour and of [his] salue hadde, And gaf hym gold good won þat gladede here hertes, And þei gauen hym agayn a glasene houe. Lyf leyuede þat leche-craft lette sholde elde, And to-dryue away deþ with [dyas and] drogges. Elde auntred hym on lyf and atte laste he hitte A fisician with a forrede hod þat he fel in a palsye, And þer deiede þat doctour er thre dayes after. “Now ich seo,” saide lyf “þat surgerye ne phisike May nat a myte availle to medlen a-?ens elde.” And in hope of hus hele good heorte he hente, And rod so to reuel a ryche place and a murye; The companye of comfort men cleped hit som tyme. And elde hastede after hym and ouer my hefde ?eode, And made me balled by-fore and bar on þe croune; So harde he ?eode ouer myn hefde hit wol be sene euere. “Syre vuel-ytauht elde,” quaþ ich “vnhende go with þe! Suþþe whanne was þe hey wey ouer menne hefdes? Haddest þow be hende,” quaþ ich “þow woldest haue asked leue.” “?e, leue lordeyn!” quaþ he and leyde on me with age, And hitte me vnder þe ere vnneþe may ich huyre. He boffatede me a-boute þe mouthe and bete oute my wang-teþ, And gyuede me wiþ goutes ich may nat go at large. And of þe wo þat ich was yn my wif hadde reuthe, And wisshede wel witerlyche þat ich were in heuene. For þe lyme [þat] she louede me fore and leef was to feele, And a nyghtes nameliche when we naked were, Ich ne myghte in none manere maken hit at heore wille, So elde and [hue] hit hadde a-feynted and forbete. And as ich sat in þis sorwe [ich] sauh how kynde passede, And deþ drow neyghynge me for drede gan ich quaken, And criede carfully to kynde [out] of kare me brynge, “Lo, hou elde þe hore haþ me byseye; Awreke me, yf ?oure wil beo for ich wolde be hennes.’ “Yf þow wolt beo awreke wende in-to unite, And hold þe þare euere til ich sende for þe, And loke þou conne som craft er þou come þennes.” “Consaileþ me, kynde,” quaþ ich “what crafte be best to leere?” “Lerne to loue,” quaþ kynde “and lef alle oþer þynges.” “Hou shal ich come to catel so to cloþe me and to feode?” “And þow loue leelliche lacke shal þe neuere Wede ne worldlich mete while þy lyf lasteþ.” And ich þorgh consail of kynde comsede to rome Thorgh contricion and confession til ich cam to unite; And þer was conscience constable crystine to saue. He was byseged soþliche with seuene grete geauntes, That with Antecrist helden harde a?eyns conscience. Sleuthe with hus slynge an hard saut he made. Proude preostes cam with hym passend an hundred; In paltokes and pikede shoes and pissares longe knyues, Thei come a?eyns conscience with couetise þei helden. “By þe marie,” quaþ a mansed preest was of þe marche of yrelonde, “Ich counte conscience no more by so ich cacche seluer, Than ich do to drynke a drawt of good ale!” And so seide syxty of þe same countreo, And shotten a?eyns hym with shot [many a schef of] oþes, And brode-hokede arwes godes herte and hus nailes, And hadde almost vnite and holychurche a-doune. Conscience cride, “helpe cleregie, oþer ich falle, Thorgh imparfit preestes and prelates of holychurche.” Freres herde hym crie and comen hym to helpe, Ac for þei couþe nat wel here craft conscience for-soke hem. Neode neyhede þo ner to conscience he tolde Þat þei came for couetise to haue cure of soules, And for thei aren poure, paraunter for patrimonye hem failleþ, Thei wolle flaterie to fare wel to folke þat ben riche. And sitthen þei chosen chile and c[h]aytif pouerte, Let hem chewe as þei chosen and charge hem with no cure. For lommere he lyeþ þat liflode mote begge, Than he þat laboreþ for lyflode and leneþ hit beggeres. And sitthen freres for-soke þe felicite of erthe, Lat hem be as beggers oþer lyue by aungeles fode.” Conscience of þis consail tho comsede for to lauhe, And cortesly confortid hem and cald yn alle freres, And seide, “sires, sothly wel-come be ?e alle To unite and to holichurche ac o þing ich ?ow preye, Holdeþ ?ow in unite and haueþ non enuye To lerede ne to lewide bote lyueþ after ?oure reule. And ich wol beo ?oure borw ?e shulleþ haue brede and cloþes, And oþer necessaries ynowh ?ou shal no þyng lakke, With þat ?e leue logyk and lerneþ for to louye. For loue lefte þei lordshupes boþe londe and scole, Frere fraunceis and domynyk for loue to be holy. And yf [?e] coueiteþ cure kynde wol ?ow telle, That in mesure god made alle manere þynges, And sette hit at [a] sertayn and at a syker numbre, And nempnede hem names and nombrede þe sterres; Qui numerat multitudinem stellarum. Kynges and knyghtes þat kepen and defenden, Hauen officers vnder hem and ech of hem a certayn, And yf þei wage men to werre thei wryten hem in numbre; Wol no treserour take hem wages trauayle þei neuere so sore, Bote hij beon nempned in þe numbre of hem þat ben ywaged. Alle oþere in bataille beeþ [yholde] brybours, Pilours and pyke-herneys in eche parshe a-corsede. Monekes and monyales and alle men of religion, Here ordre and here ruele wol to haue a certayn numbre; Of lered and lewede þe lawe wole and askeþ A certayn for a certayn saue onliche of freres! For-thi,” quaþ conscience, “by crist kynde wit me telleþ, Hit is wickede to wage ?ou ?e wexeþ oute of numbre. Heuene haueþ euene numbre And helle is with-oute numbre; For-thi ich wolde witerly þat ?e were in registre, And ?oure numbre vnder notarie signe and noþer more ne lasse.” Enuye herde þis And het freres go to scole, And lerne logik and lawe and eke contemplacion, And preche men of plato and prouen hit by seneca, That alle þyng vnder heuene ouhte to beo in comune. He lyeþ, as ich leyue þat to þe lewede so precheþ, For god made to men a lawe and Moyses hit tauhte, Non concupisces rem proximi tui. And vuel is this yholde in parshes of yngelonde, For persones and parshe-preestes þat sholde þe peuple shryue, And thei beon curatours cald to knowe and to hele, Alle þat been here parshenes penaunces [to enioyne], And beo ashamede in here shryft; ac shame makeþ hem wende, And fleo to [þe] freres as fals folke to westmynstre, Þat borweþ and bereþ hit thuder And thenne byddeþ frendes ?eorne of for-?euenesse oþer lenger ?eres leue. Ac while he is in westmynstre he wol be by-fore, And maken hym myrie with oþer menne goodes. And so hit fareþ by muche folke þat to freres hem shryueþ, As asisours and executours þei shal ?eue þe freres A parcel to preye for hem and maken hem [murye] With þe remenant of þe good þat oþer men by-swonke, And suffre þe dede in dette to þe day of dome. Enuye here-fore hatyde conscience, And freres to philosophie he fond hem to scole, The while couetise and vnkyndenesse assailede conscience. In vnite holichurche conscience held hym, And made pees portor to pynne þe ?ates. Alle tale-tellours and titereres in ydel, Ypocrise and thei and hard sawt thei ?euen. Ypocrise at þe ?ate harde gan fighte, And wondede wel wickedly meny a wys techere, That with conscience acordede and cardinale uertues. Conscience calde a leche þat couthe wel shryue, To salue þo þat sik were and þorgh synne y-wonded. Shruft shupte sharpe salue and made men do penaunce For here mysdedes that thei wrouht hadde, And þat peers pardoun were ypaied Redde quod dedes. Some likede nat þis leche and lettres þei senten, Yf eny surgeyn were in þe sege þat softere couþe plastre. Sire lyf-to-lyue-in-lecherie lay þere and gronede; For fastynge of a friday he ferde as he wolde deye. “Ther is a surgen in þe sege þat softe can handle, And more of fisik by fer and fairer he plastreþ; On frere flaterere is fisician and surgien.” Quaþ contricion to conscience “do hym come to unite, For her is meny man hurt þorgh ypocrisye.” “We haue no neode,” quaþ conscience “ich wote no bettere leche Þan person oþer parshe-prest penytancer oþer busshup, Saue peers the plouhman þat hath powere ouere alle, And indulgence may do bote yf dette lette.” “Ich may wel suffry,” quaþ conscience “sutthe ?e desiren That frere flaterere be fet and fysyke ?ou syke.” The frere here-of herde and hyede faste To a lorde for a lettere leue to haue to curen As he a curatour were and cam with hus letteres Baldely to þe bushope and hus breef hadde, In countreyes þer he cam confessions to hure; And cam ther conscience was and knockede atte ?ate. Pees vnpynnede þe dore þat was portour of vnite, And in hast he [askede] ‘what hus wil were?’ “In faith,” quaþ þis frere “for profit and for helthe, Carpe ich wolde with contricion and þer-fore cam ich hyder.” “He is syke,” seide pees “and so aren meny oþere; Ypocrisye haþ hurt hem ful hard is yf [þei] keuere.” “Ich am a surgen,” seide þe frere “and salues can ich make, Conscience knoweþ me wel and what ich can don.” “Ich preye the,” quaþ pees þo “er þow passe forþere, What hattest þow? ich praye [þe] hele nat þy name.” “Certes,” seide his felawe “syre penetrans-domos.” “?e, go þi gate,” quaþ pees “by god, for al þy fysike, Bote þow conne [oþer] craft þou comest nat here-ynne. Ich knew such on ones nat eyhte wynter passede, Cam yn thus y-coped at a court þere ich dwellede. He was my lordes leche and my ladies boþe, And atte last þis lymytour þo my lord was oute, He saluede so oure wommen til somme were with childe.” Hende-speche het pees þo opene þe ?ates— “Lat yn þe frere and hus felawe and make hem faire chere. He may seo and huyre here so may by-falle, That lyf þorgh hus lore shal leue couetise, And to beo a-drad of deþ and wiþ-drawe hym fro pruyde, And acorde with conscience and cusse here aiþer oþere.” Thus þorgh hende-speche entrede þe frere, And cam to conscience and corteisliche hym grette. “Thou art welcome,” quaþ conscience “canst þou hele syke?” “Here is contricion,” quaþ conscience “My cosyn, ywonded; Conforte hym,” quaþ conscience “and take kepe to hus sores. The plastres of þe person and þe pouderes beoþ to sore, And lat hem lygge ouer-lange and loþ is to chaungen; Fro lente to lente he let hus plastres [byte].” “That is ouerlonge,” quaþ þis lymytour “ich leyue ich shal amende hit.” He goþ [&amp;] gropeþ contrition and gaf hym a plastre Of “a pryue payement and ich shal preye for ?ow, And for hem þat ?e aren holden to al my lyf-tyme, And make ?ow my lady in masse and in matynes, As freres of oure fraternite for a litel seluer.” Thus he goþ and gadereþ and gloseþ þer he shryueþ, Til contrition hadde clene for-?ute to crie and wepe and wake For hus wickede werkes as he was wonded by-fore. For comfort of hus confessour contricion he lefte, That is þe souereyne salue for alle kynne synnes. Anon sleuthe seih þat and so dude pruyde, And comen with a kene wil conscience to assaile. Conscience criede eft “cleregie, come help me!” And bad contricion to come to helpe [kepe] þe ?ate. “He lith [adreynt],” saide pees “and so doþ meny oþere; The frere with hus fisik þis folke haþ enchaunted, And doþ men drynke dwale þat men dredeþ no synne.” “By crist,” quaþ conscience tho “ich wol by-come a pilgryme, And wenden as wide as the worlde regneþ, To seke peers þe plouhman þat pruyde myghte destruye, And [þat] freres hadden a fyndynge þat for neode flateren, And counterpleideþ me, conscience; nowe kynde me a-venge, And sende me hap and hele til ich haue peers plouhman!” And suthe he gradde after grace til ich gan a-wake.
