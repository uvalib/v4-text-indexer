      <field name="fulltext">Part I. 1823–1830 I. A FREE TRANSLATION OF A LETTER FROM PRINCE HILT TO A FRIEND AT PARIS. From climate hot and hot campaign I write, ma chère amie, To let you know how nobly Spain Agrees with France and me; All folks misled by false pretences Recover now their chains, and senses, And all the crowds I see Adore, without the slightest shyness, The Inquisition, and my Highness. Whene'er we meet a whiskered foe He's sure to be defeated, (My bulletins have told you so) Yet corpses have retreated; And every day the battle-slain, Substantial ghosts, start up again, And Hell and I are cheated, And blade and ball begin to soften, We kill the brutes so very often! We pass our time delightfully; I like, as I'm a sinner, My laurels after victory, My claret after dinner; Yet mirth and meat are very dear, And pursuivant and pioneer Are looking rather thinner; And though I love the Spanish ladies, I wish they'd let us into Cadiz. I also like Madrid nobility Where Dons and Dames abound, And patronize Madrid civility Where drums and Vivas sound; I also like the Friars and Nuns, The cowls, the Canons—not the guns— And look in rapture round When all the Counts and all their wives Damn the Guerrillas and their knives. The peasantry seem quite content; The King has got the gout; The Cortez seem securely pent— The devil may drive them out! Old Moncey has been often bit; But he has length of beard and wit, And knows what he's about; While Mina swears in every weather, And cuts his jokes and throats together. You know O'Donnel's plot was blown; And General Morillo Might just as well have left alone His little peccadillo. They did not, sweetest love, amuse, And were not of the smallest use; And I must wear the willow, And mourn that two such glorious traitors Could only bring their grins and gaiters. Adieu! you'll understand my story From this right royal rhyme; I've gained a deal of ground and glory, And lost a deal of time. My uniform is much admired: (I'm getting wonderfully tired) My boots are quite sublime; And I remember in my prayer Paris—kid gloves—et vous ma chère! II. CHANCERY MORALS. “Round, around, about, about, about: All ill come running in, all good keep out.”—Macbeth. Bold Benbow rubs his jovial eyes, And lauds the Law's refinement; Dense Dugdale is in ecstasies, Though Carlile's in confinement; And guilt hath wed legality; And useful through the nation Is prurience to publicity And sin to circulation. “Don Juan was a horrid beast, And that was why we selled 'un:” So say the Statutes; or at least So says the Earl of Eldon. Pert Poll has come from Kentish Town With sixpence in her pocket, Red Rose has sold her yellow gown, Meek Meg her little locket, And Molly, who with Mrs. Fry Has crammed a deal of cant, goes To pawn her prayers for poetry, Her canticles for Cantos. “‘Don Juan’ is a very feast, So wicked 'tis and well done, We thank Heav'n for it—or at least We thank the Earl of Eldon!” The City hath its myriads sent To learn what Byron's pen does, And bakers study sentiment, And butchers innuendoes; And big Bow bells unheeded chime, And Beaux and Belles grow tender; And Taste admires a double rhyme And Ton a double entendre; And frail ones, whose illicit trade Could never else have held on, Cry “Bless my soul! our fortune's made! Long live the Earl of Eldon!” The girls of the Academy, With empty heads and purses, Bless Charity and Chancery For cheapening naughty verses; And Mauds and Marys peep and pay With sigh and shilling ready, And Anna envies “Julia,” And Araminta “Haidee”; And Gouvernantes are furious quite— “Lord! what have Bet and Bell done? They've read ‘Don Juan’ through to-night, And blest the Earl of Eldon!” Bad Byron loathes the legal Fence, The guardian of good order, The conqueror of common sense From Cornwall to the Border; And damns his doubts and his delays, His quibbles and quotations, His knowing nods and solemn says, His robes and revelations. “This piracy will never do! I'll send you down to Hell, Don; The devils have a right to you— So says the Earl of Eldon.” III. LETTERS TO ILLUSTRIOUS CHARACTERS. I.—A COMPLIMENTARY EPISTLE TO THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA. Great Sire, since Princes sometimes ask— For Princes are but men— Respite from table and from task, From Petersburg's enlivening flask And Pozzo's patent pen, Don't give your Royal brain the vapours By opening Opposition papers; Leave Prince and Parliament alone, To squabble for their barren bone; While Pittites pout and Foxites fume, And Mr. Peel drubs Mr. Hume, Mind only how your Guards are laced, And pinch your subjects, and your waist, And put embroidery on your breeches, And read no more of Tierney's speeches. For me, I am a loyal wight, And love to flatter Princes; The Treasury triumphs when I write, And all the faction winces; And I am going to compare Your father's honourable heir With Philip's less resplendent son, The glory of old Macedon. Look very grand and very gracious, And smooth your brow and your mustachios, And let a would-be Laureate tell a Few stories of the Prince of Pella. Philip and Paul, your sire and his, Both found a gory bier; He shed the murderers' blood for this, And you—the mourner's tear; He rooted up, you down—the weed; And sage was your adviser, For his might be the holier deed, But yours was far the wiser; Your boasting, like his bowl, mounts high; He poured his long libations As quickly as your Majesty Can pour your protestations; And Greece was ever fond of whim, And fond of falsehood too, And, as she swallowed wine for him, She swallows lies for you. Both made a bonfire in the land, For love's—or glory's lures; Sweet Thais lit the Grecian brand, And sour Rostopchin yours. Your torch was dipped in grief and gore, And his in mirth and laughter; He drank a drop or two before, You wept as many after. You both were swift in letting blood, And both were swift in swearing, And, if he passed Granicus' flood, Why, you have passed all bearing; So both have made a monstrous fuss, And made the barbers prate, And you are dubbed Magnanimous, And he was voted Great. And lauded and bespattered thus By gazers and by gapers, He lies in his sarcophagus, And you—in your state-papers. And so farewell! Live on, in all That decks a crown with gladness, In tented field and tapestried hall, In majesty and madness; Enjoy the tailor's cunning toil, And patronize Macassar Oil, And never heed how Canning frets, And plan your soldiers' epaulettes; And sleep, begirt by vows and verses, And bowing Counts, and bitter curses. IV. LETTERS TO ILLUSTRIOUS CHARACTERS. II.—TO LA DESIRÉE OF LE DESIRÉ. Fair Lady, from whose lips and eyes The Royal Bourbon snatches Oblivion of rebellious cries, Thick legs and thicker Deputies, Short wit and long despatches, Sweet Sorceress, at whose smile or frown, The Father of all France Sinks all the sorrows of the Crown, And leaves the Duke to take the town, Or else—to take his chance; Forgive me if I dare intrude On your exalted station, And venture—I was always rude— To greet you in your solitude With song and salutation. Queen of the play-house and the Press, Of operas and of odes, Supreme o'er dances and o'er dress, All-influencing patroness Of ministers and modes, 'Tis yours—'tis yours to bring again Legitimacy's glorious reign, And fill again the arms of kings With liaisons and twenty things Which fled in horror from the scene Of Sansculotte and Guillotine. Yours is the great and varied sway Which politics and pins obey; Yours is the empire, as is fit, O'er Church and Senate, war and wit, Curés and canons, marshals, misses, Cards, compliments, charades, and kisses, The soldier's sash, the poet's dream, New bonnets, and the old régime. The fair and faded Marquis flies To tell his griefs to you, With dingy coat and twitching eyes, Cold sentiments and burning sighs, Long stories and long queue. To you the happy author brings His dry though dripping sheet, And reads, and raves, and swears, and sings, And eulogizes limping kings In very limping feet; And advocates fill up the crowd Immensely ignorant and loud, And officers with bloodless blades, Who practise grins and gasconnades, And doat on laces and liqueur, Love, glory, and the Moniteur; And the Prince-Prelate—for he knows How all the pageant comes and goes, Looks on in silence all the while With shaking head and quiet smile, And smothers, till a proper season, His studied jest and plotted treason. Thrice blest is he for whom you deck Your boudoir and your curls, For whom you clothe your snowy neck In perfumes and in pearls; Thrice blest, for he remembers not That horrible Convention, The perils of his exiled lot, His patrons, and his pension; And Spain is low, and Rentes are high, In spite of Lafayette; And Paris is in ecstasy, And England is in debt; And Soult and Suchet fret and grieve, And pretty Poissardes bellow “Vive!” And Murder sleeps in St. Helena, And Moncey is besieging Mina; And that dark day can ne'er come back, When stars and ribbands went to wrack, When Gallia lost her lord and master, And Peace fled fast, and he fled faster; And all the fops who drank and dressed, And wore a trinket at the breast, In peril of their life and limb, Packed up their trunks, and followed him. V. LOVE'S ETERNITY. “Cum Paris Enone potuit sperare relicta Ad fontem Xanthi versa recurrit aqua.”—Ovid. What need of wit? What need of wile? I know your eyes are killing; But oh! he isn't worth a smile, Who isn't worth a shilling! And yet, by all the gods of rhyme, And by your lips I swear, Though all my love is loss of time And all my hope despair, The glittering stream shall cease to stray, The wind refuse to rove, All solid things shall melt away, Before I cease to love! Fair Freedom shall be found in Quod, Stern Justice in the Quorum, Carlile shall praise the grace of God, John Bull shall learn decorum, Loyal addresses shall omit “Our fortunes and our lives,” The Commons shall be famed for wit, The Lords for virtuous wives, The Tenth shall dress without a glass Or dine with one remove, All monstrous things shall come to pass Before I cease to love. Young widowhood shall lose its weeds, Old kings shall loathe the Tories, And monks be tired of telling beads, And blues of telling stories; And titled suitors shall be crossed, And famished poets married, And Canning's motion shall be lost And Hume's amendment carried, And Chancery shall cease to doubt, And Algebra to prove, And hoops come in, and gas go out, Before I cease to love. And Peel shall sink his Popery-cry, And Buxton lay his plans down, And Bankes shall vote with honesty, And Liverpool with Lansdowne; And hungry knights shall lose their steak And never talk of pairing, And county members keep awake Through half an hour of Baring; And not a soul shall go to grin When Martin goes to move, And Mr. Cobbett shall get in, Before I cease to love! Good sense shall go to Parliament, The tithe shall be abated, A Papist shall be innocent, A slave emancipated, A French gallant shall break his heart, A Spanish Count his fetters, A fortune-teller trust her art, A Radical his betters; A pretty face shall like a veil, A pretty hand a glove, And Reason win, and bribery fail, Before I cease to love. In short, the world shall all go mad, And saints shall take to masquing, And kisses and estates be had For nothing but the asking; And beauty shall be ugliness, And ocean shall be dry, And passion shall be passionless And truth itself a lie, And “Stars” shall cease to shine below, And stars to shine above, And Cunningham be left for Lowe, Before I cease to love. VI. A SONG OF IMPOSSIBILITIES. “Ici finit le roman; où l'on remarquera que je ne suis pas heureux dans la conclusion de mes amours.”—Rousseau. Lady, I loved you all last year, How honestly and well— Alas! would weary you to hear, And torture me to tell; I raved beneath the midnight sky, I sang beneath the limes— Orlando in my lunacy, And Petrarch in my rhymes. But all is over! When the sun Dries up the boundless main, When black is white, false-hearted one, I may be yours again! When passion's early hopes and fears Are not derided things; When truth is found in falling tears, Or faith in golden rings; When the dark Fates that rule our way Instruct me where they hide One woman that would ne'er betray, One friend that never lied; When summer shines without a cloud, And bliss without a pain; When worth is noticed in a crowd, I may be yours again! When science pours the light of day Upon the lords of lands; When Huskisson is heard to say That Lethbridge understands; When wrinkles work their way in youth, Or Eldon's in a hurry; When lawyers represent the truth, Or Mr. Sumner Surrey; When aldermen taste eloquence Or bricklayers champagne; When common law is common sense, I may be yours again When learned judges play the beau, Or learned pigs the tabor; When traveller Bankes beats Cicero, Or Mr. Bishop Weber; When Sinking Funds discharge a debt, Or female hands a bomb; When bankrupts study the Gazette, Or colleges Tom Thumb; When little fishes learn to speak, Or poets not to feign; When Dr. Geldart construes Greek, I may be yours again! When Pole and Thornton honour cheques, Or Mr. Const a rogue; When Jericho's in Middlesex, Or minuets in vogue; When Highgate goes to Devonport, Or fashion to Guildhall; When argument is heard at Court, Or Mr. Wynn at all; When Sidney Smith forgets to jest, Or farmers to complain; When kings that are are not the best, I may be yours again! When peers from telling money shrink, Or monks from telling lies; When hydrogen begins to sink, Or Grecian scrip to rise; When German poets cease to dream, Americans to guess; When Freedom sheds her holy beam On Negroes, and the Press; When there is any fear of Rome, Or any hope of Spain; When Ireland is a happy home, I may be yours again! When you can cancel what has been, Or alter what must be, Or bring once more that vanished scene, Those withered joys, to me; When you can tune the broken lute, Or deck the blighted wreath, Or rear the garden's richest fruit, Upon a blasted heath; When you can lure the wolf at bay Back to his shattered chain, To-day may then be yesterday— I may be yours again! VII. ODE TO THE CHANCELLOR. IMITATED FROM HORACE, III., XV. Old Lady of Chancery, why do you tarry So long on the throne of your vanishing reign? The neighbourhood titters whene'er you miscarry, And hints that your labours are labours in vain. There is one thing at least, which your closest endeavour Will hardly discover a reason to doubt, That be candles and statesmen how wicked soever, All candles and statesmen at last must go out. When girls in their summer begin to grow willing, Their grandmothers think about making their wills; And oh, you had better be done with your billing, Before your old lovers say “no” to your bills! 'Tis all very pretty, when love or defiance Is breathed from the lips of a younger coquette; When Peel is seduced by the Holy Alliance, Or Robinson flirts with the National Debt. But it is not for you, when the grave gapes before you, To be scaring gilt stars with those wrinkles of awe; Giving garters and ribbands to fools who adore you, And stealing silk gowns from your daughters-in-law. Sweet Gifford, I grant, as your tenderness taught her, May flaunt in rich suits, and be kind to appeals; And dabble her scull in the dirtiest water, Like a Greenlander, all for the love of the seals; But you—put your salary up in your full sack, And go to your grave with a gentle decline; Take a nightcap of woollens instead of a wool-sack, And leave to George Canning his roses and wine. VIII. WISDOM OF THE GREAT COUNCIL. I. “Ere our measures we move, our facts we must prove,” Says the solemn official Goulburn; And proceeds with grave face to establish his case, Like a meagre octavo from Colburn: Undertaking to show that a vigorous blow, Struck home by the heads of the nation, In the name of the Crown, ought at once to put down The Catholic Association. “Sir, they never were sent to misrepresent Our counties, ports, boroughs and cities; Yet they constantly ape our voice, manner and shape, Standing orders and standing committees; Self-convoked, self-returned, self-controlled, self-adjourned, Without more than six weeks' vacation, They make such a fuss, not a soul cares for Us: This impudent Association! “How freely they sent their Catholic “Rent” (A Popish misnomer for taxing), While Robinson burns at their easy returns Who pocket the money for axing! Very true, they're not willing to part with a shilling; Their subscriptions are mere affectation, By menaces made up—though readily paid up— Hypocritical Association! “Our reliance how just, that the law we could trust For protecting our wives and our daughters— Though we very well know, only three years ago Ireland lay like a log on the waters! What monsters are those, who dare interpose In our criminal administration! Though all the committed are tried—and acquitted; What a culpable Association! “Sir, turning from Law, we must listen with awe To the sounds of confusion and riot; But if all tamely sit, and in silence submit— They are still more alarming when quiet! Of all evils accurst, civil war is the worst, And fiery insubordination! Better bloodshed and rout, than a peace brought about By this damnable Association! “Sir, I hold that the priests are no better than beasts— In spite of some trifling varieties; And beg to disclaim all this fury and flame On the part of the Bible Societies. The Ass in the Fable was quite as much able In Heaven to produce agitation, As aught this side Hell—but the soul-shaking bell Of the Catholic Association! “Without throwing dirt, I most fully assert— Contradict me who dare or who can, Sir— That our foes are plunged in incompatible sin! Let the votes of this House give the answer Most humble, yet proudest—most silent, yet loudest— The greatest—and least—in creation, The strongest—the weakest, the fiercest—the meekest, Is the Catholic Association. “We must check by main force their dangerous course, Put them down by the sword of the Law, Sir! But if our Act fail, our mere wish will prevail, And our enemies, bowing, withdraw—Sir!” He ceased. Mr. Butterworth, a preacher from Lutterworth, Stood as clerk to his clear predication; Most pious of laymen, he groaned a grave Amen! So good-night to the Association! IX. WISDOM OF THE GREAT COUNCIL. II. “So help me God!”—Speech of the Duke of York. “God help thee, silly one!”—Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin. “My lords, since things at last are come To such a situation, That members of the Church of Rome Grow weary of starvation; Since in the Commons House for once Some common sense is seated, Since Mr. Bankes is called a dunce And Mr. Peel defeated; Since Noble Lords begin to joke When Orthodoxy preaches, And toil profanely to provoke Meek prelates to make speeches; Since Plunket is not deemed a thief; Since placemen talk of reason; Since freedom is not unbelief, Nor toleration treason, Nought but a Godhead, or an ass, Can mar this wicked work. My Lords, this Bill shall never pass, So help me God!” said York. “Though Mr. Leslie Foster winced From what he once asserted; Though Mr. Brownlow is convinced, And Mr. North converted; Though even country gentlemen Are sick of half their maggots, And rustics mock the Vicar, when He prates of fiery faggots; Though Hume and Brougham and twenty more Are swaggering and swearing, And Scarlett hopes the scarlet whore Will not be found past bearing; Though Reverend Norwich does not mind The feuds of two and seven, And trusts that humble prayer may find A dozen roads to Heaven; Till royal heads are lit with gas— Till Hebrews dine off pork— My Lords, this Bill shall never pass, So help me God!” said York. “Let England from her slumbers wake To greet her best adviser, And know, that nought on earth can make The Heir Apparent wiser. I care not how the seasons fly; How circumstances alter; I care not for necessity, Which makes Olympus falter; I care not for a Parliament; I care not for a people; I care not for an argument As long as Strasburg steeple; I care not who are faithful still, I care not who are failers, In short, I care for Burdett's bill As much as for my tailor's; And though the rebels rise en masse With bludgeon and with fork, My Lords, this Bill shall never pass, So help me God!” said York. “Oh, yes, let English wrath appal The Irish brutes and Catos; And let the curse of famine fall On all who eat potatoes; Let gold, my Lords, be spent like dust, Let blood be spilt like water, Let churchmen preach by cut and thrust, And educate by slaughter; Let Bradley King and Harcourt Lees Awake their zeal and learning, And nib their pen for rhapsodies, And light their torch for burning; Let Paget choose a proper stand Against the Pope's invaders, And Chester raise his reverend hand To bless the Lord's crusaders; Let Ireland read a mournful mass From Holyhead to Cork: My Lords, this Bill shall never pass, So help me God!” said York. “And think, my Lords! when kings are crowned A solemn oath is plighted; Which he who thinks an empty sound Is grievously benighted; And sure, my Lords, that noble lord Has very little breeding Who asks a king to break his word To save a little bleeding! I speak my own peculiar creed; I answer for no other; Of course I don't presume to read The conscience of my brother; But I, where'er my head may rest, Whate'er my lot or station— I pledge myself to do my best To plague the Irish nation. There once a clever fable was About a Log, and Stork: My Lords, this Bill shall never pass, So help me God!” said York. X. THE LAY OF THE CHEESE. “Does your Honour like cheese?” “Like it!” said the Duke, whose good-nature anticipated what was to follow, “cakes and cheese are a dinner for an Emperor!”—Heart of Midlothian. The Pope, that pagan full of pride, From whom may Heaven defend us, Did lay one summer eventide, A horrid plot to end us; O'Connell came and talked his fill; Sir Francis Burdett made a Bill; And honest men felt great alarms, Both for their faiths and for their farms, Solid men of Cheshire! We heard around the savage cries Of men with ragged breeches, Who practised the barbarities Of making hay—and speeches; And Popish priests, disguised like Whigs, Prepared to steal the Parson's pigs, To overthrow the Church and steeple And break the backs of upright people, Solid men of Cheshire! Then up the Heir Apparent got Of Britain's wide dominion, And said that Heaven and Earth should not Demolish his opinion; That Heirs Apparent were not meant To listen to an argument, And bringing Royal Dukes to reason, He thought, was little short of treason— Solid men of Cheshire. And what reward did men devise For such a peroration, Which saved their lives and liberties From transubstantiation? A long address, filled full of beauties, Expressive of their loves and duties; And also a prodigious cheese, As heavy as Sir Harcourt Lees— Solid men of Cheshire. Rank makes a virtue of a sin; Small labour it would cost one To prove that Peers a cheese may win, As Æsop's magpie lost one. The Prince and pie perhaps inherit A voice of nearly equal merit; A fox induced the bird to puke; A lawyer bammed the Royal Duke— Solid men of Cheshire. “Blest cheese,” said girls in grogram vests, “Rub off your rural shyness; And feast his Royal Highness' guests, And feast his Royal Highness. 'Tis thine to catch the sweets that slip From Mr. Peel's melodious lip, The Chancellor's Bœotian thunders, And Blomfield's Æschylean blunders— Solid men of Cheshine. “The Parmesan upon the board Shall tasteless seem before thee, And many a spiritual lord Shall breathe a blessing o'er thee; A hallowed spot the shrine shall be, Where'er a shrine is made for thee, And none but Reverend Rats shall dare To taste a single morsel there— Solid men of Cheshire.” Alas, the fatal sisters frowned Upon the promised pleasure; The creditors came darkly round, And seized the ponderous treasure! But yet, to ease the Duke's distress, They forwarded the long address, Because—to strip the fact of feigning— The paper was not worth detaining! Solid men of Cheshire! XI. ROYAL EDUCATION. A NURSERY SONG. I am a babe of royalty; Queen Charlotte was my grannam; And Parliament has voted me Six thousand pounds per annum; To teach me how to read and write, To teach me elocution, To teach me how to feast and fight For the king and constitution, As a well-taught Prince should do, Who is taught by contribution. I'll have a doll of porphyry With diamonds in her curls, And a rocking-horse of ivory, And a skipping rope of pearls; I'll have a painted paper kite With banker's bills for wings, And a golden fiddle to play at night With a silver wire for strings, As a well-taught Prince should have, Who is sprung from the German kings. My woman of the bed chamber Shall dress in the finest silk; And a nobleman of Hanover Shall boil my bread and milk; My breeches shall be of cloth of gold, My night-cap of Mechlin lace, And Cologne water, hot and cold, Shall be ready to wash my face, As a well-taught Prince should wash, Who is come of a royal race. And when my coach and six shall jog, With horns, huzzas, and banners, To some gaunt German pedagogue Who teaches Greek and manners, How very ready I shall be To show that I'm fit for ruling, By gaming and by gallantry, And other kinds of fooling Which a well-taught Prince should learn, Who costs so much in schooling. I'll learn of Uncle George to make A sword-knot, and a bow, And I'll learn of Uncle York to take The long odds, and a vow; And Uncle Clarence shall supply The science of imprecation, And you, my own papa, shall try To teach me fabrication, Which a well-taught Prince should study, Whose tutors are paid by the nation. I'll learn of Peel his lunacy About the priests and popes; From ... to live in infamy, From Canning to talk in tropes; From Blomfield to discern new lights, To darken the old, from Scott, From Liverpool the chartered rights Which an Englishman has not, As a well-taught Prince should know, Who is born for a kingly lot. While education day by day My native wit enlarges, Oh shall I not at last repay The country's heavy charges! As wise as any other Guelph, As useful and as dear, Oh shall I not procure myself A people's scorn and fear, Which a well-taught Prince should earn, With six thousand pounds a year! XII. THE CORONATION OF CHARLES X. I. THE JOURNEY TO RHEIMS. “Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ipsi.” Oh was it not a glorious day For all the mighty nation, When Charles set out—le bien aimé— To act his coronation! All people left their old abodes To aid the celebration, And purchased flowers, and studied modes, In glad anticipation Of such a day. Oh who shall sing the motley hordes Of women and of warriors; Or count the Counts, or laud the Lords, Who started from the Barriers! Canaille was mixed with Cavaliers, And fair ones jostled farriers, And gouty limbs and feeble years Cried shame upon the tarriers At home that day. The student started from his books, The farmer from his stubble; The belle bestowed upon her looks Then times her usual trouble; Monsieur for once forgot to swear At being made a bubble, And gaily charged his tabatière, When conducteurs charged double Their fare that day. And there were shouts of deputies Awaking from the Session, And Presidents of Colleges To grace the King's procession; And mayors of little towns came out To read their faith's profession, Which might have been improved, no doubt, By half an hour's compression The previous day. The peasants on the journey showed Their loyalty was hearty, By flinging laurels on the road Before the Royal Party; They waved old banners to the skies Inscribed “Non minor Marte,” And scratched from their transparencies The name of Bonaparté, To suit the day. And right and left upon the way They made the cannons rattle; And babes in arms cried out “O gai! The French have won a battle!” And rockets flew about like rain, And frightened all the cattle; Three dukes were very nearly slain, Which would have made a tattle For many a day. The king, whose steeds had made a start, Composed the fright he woke in, And gave of his benignant heart A most bewitching token: “Mon Dieu!” the gracious monarch said, Before the leech had spoken; “Mon Dieu! Has Damas broke his head? I wish it had been broken Some other day!” But oh, at Rheims, the day before, A hundred prayers were canted, And dull addresses mumbled o'er, And naughty ballads chaunted; The capital's debauchery Was all at once transplanted, And Etienne fils brought eau de vie, And Vérey's scullion panted At Rheims that day. The cool Café, the cabriolet, Cigars and macaronis, And Rouge et noir, and eau sucré, And conversaziones; The loungers of the Tuileries Find here their ancient cronies, And ladies, hot with ecstasies, May hurry to Tortoni's For ice to-day. And Father Paul, the Capuchin, Is damning all his flock—O! And pretty little Adeline Percurrit pulpita socco; And rich and poor and peer and boor May find at eight o'clock—O! “Les premiers soupirs d'Amour”— Les derniers de Jocko— Or both, to-day. So when Apollo from the skies Drove down his coach and four—O! He did not leave one pair of eyes Bedewed in Rheims with sorrow; While those who could not buy a bed, And those who could not borrow, Lay down upon the floor, and said “I wish it were to-morrow, And not to-day!” XIII. THE CORONATION OF CHARLES X. II.—RHEIMS. “Wherefore come ye not to court? Certain 'tis the rarest sport.”—Skelton.” “God save the king!”—What God? What king In sooth it hardly matters; For Fortune is a fickle thing, And as she builds she batters, The world goes round; the daintiest guest May live to gnaw the platters, And he that wears the purple vest May wear the rags and tatters Some other day. An exile looked with signs of grief Upon his foreign letters, And sighed—“Now hang the little thief! He bullies all his betters!” The dirge is shifted for the dance, The creditors are debtors, The exile reigns in merry France, The bully dies in fetters, Alas the day! Rheims! midwife of French Royalty! In thy age-hallowed towers Reviving Aristocracy Sits garlanded with flowers; And Order smiles her placid smile In spite of Satan's powers, And sweet Religion all the while Rains down benignant showers Of Priests to-day. But thou didst see another sight In that terrific season When mobs pulled down the matron—Right, And crowned the harlot—Reason; When raving cobblers mended creeds, And fishwives babbled treason, And honest men who told their beads Were like to find their weasand Cut through some day. Thou saw'st the painted goddess led In triumph through the city; While monks looked blue and maids looked red Before her fierce banditti; Thou heard'st the drums and trumpets roll, When Horror, growing witty, Made greybeards dance the Carmagnole, And virgins sing the ditty Of blood that day! A butcher with unholy feet Profaned the shuddering altar; His surplice was a winding sheet, His girdle was a halter. Alas, where massacre was mass, And blasphemy was psalter, Those hands of iron, throats of brass, Did never fail or falter At church all day! Those times are changed. Thy sacred shrine Its ancient worship blesses, And lords and ladies gaily shine Amid thy carved recesses; Long whiskers come, and longer ears, False hearts and falser tresses, Court pages and Court pamphleteers, Court follies and Court dresses, All new to-day. There's Marshal Lauriston, quite gay In bobbins and in buckles; And Moncey, who in Spain one day Was rapped upon the knuckles; Chateaubriand, who bawls and broils, Villêle, who talks and truckles, And Talleyrand, who sets the toils, And holds his tongue, and chuckles, And bides his day. And Pozzo, whose intruding tread Makes such a plaguy racket, When nations, weary of their Head, Lift up a club to crack it; And Percy's formidable coat, And Esterhazy's jacket, And other clothes of lesser note, Sent over by the packet To grace the day. But where's the king? The king's asleep. Go, seek our Royal Master, And tell him that his humble sheep Are waiting for their pastor. The king was sitting in a gown As white as alabaster; “Sire,” said the Bishop, with a frown, “You should have been much faster Asleep to-day!” And then—the usual farce began, And multitudes were staring To see an old and ugly man A velvet night-cap wearing; The Moniteur declares “the whole Was solemn beyond bearing;” And quantum suff. of rigmarole, And quantum suff. of swearing Hallowed the day. He swore to keep his Royal word, He swore to keep the Charter, He swore in no unjust accord His creed or Crown to barter; He swore in all the Church's wars To give and take no quarter He swore to be a modern Mars, Or else a modern martyr For God some day. He swore to slay all heresies Without the least compunction, And understand the Trinity's Mysterious conjunction; And having oiled his hands and face With Heaven's soul-cleansing unction, Lay on his belly, full of grace, And so obtained the function Of KING that day. “May blessings fall immensely thick On him whom Heaven sets o'er us! And may he be a wall of brick Behind us and before us!” So prayed a paralytic priest Most solemn and sonorous; The people, anxious for the feast, Responded in full chorus “Amen!” that day. Then comes the dinner and the dance, And rustic sports and games, Sir; And peasants drink the health of France, And peers dispute for claims, Sir; And some are calling “Vive le Roi!” And some are calling names, Sir; And some are calling “Suivez moi!” We've had enough of Rheims, Sir, For one fine day. XIV. THE LONDON UNIVERSITY. A DISCOURSE DELIVERED BY A COLLEGE TUTOR AT A SUPPER-PARTY. Ye Dons and ye doctors, ye Provosts and Proctors, Who are paid to monopolize knowledge, Come make opposition by voice and petition To the radical infidel College; Come put forth your powers in aid of the towers Which boast of their Bishops and Martyrs, And arm all the terrors of privileged errors Which live by the wax of their Charters. Let Mackintosh battle with Canning and Vattel, Let Brougham be a friend to the “niggers,” Burdett cure the nation's misrepresentations, And Hume cut a figure in figures; But let them not babble of Greek to the rabble, Nor teach the mechanics their letters; The labouring classes were born to be asses, And not to be aping their betters. 'Tis a terrible crisis for Cam and for Isis! Fat butchers are learning dissection; And looking-glass-makers become sabbath-breakers To study the rules of reflection; “Sin: ?” and “sin: ?”—what sins can be sweeter? Are taught to the poor of both sexes, And weavers and spinners jump up from their dinners To flirt with their Y's and their X's. Chuckfarthing advances the doctrine of chances In spite of the staff of the beadle; And menders of breeches between the long stitches Write books on the laws of the needle; And chandlers all chatter of luminous matter, Who communicate none to their tallows, And rogues get a notion of the pendulum's motion Which is only of use at the gallows. The impurest of attics read pure mathematics, The ginshops are turned into cloisters, A Crawford next summer will fill you your rummer, A Coplestone open your oysters. The bells of Old Bailey are practising gaily The erudite tones of St. Mary's; The Minories any day will rear you a Kennedy, And Bishopsgate blossom with Airys. The nature of granites, the tricks of the planets, The forces of steams and of gases, The engines mechanical, the long words botanical, The ranging of beetles in classes, The delicate junctions of symbols and functions, The impossible roots of equations— Are these proper questions for Cockney digestions, Fit food for a cit's lucubrations? The eloquent pages of time-hallowed sages Embalmed by some critical German, Old presents from Brunckius, new futures from Monckius, The squabbles of Porson with Hermann, Your Alphas and Betas, your Canons of Metres, Your Infinite Powers of Particles, Shall these and such-like work make journeymen strike work And 'prentices tear up their articles? But oh! since fair Science will cruelly fly hence To smile upon vagrants and gipsies, Since knights of the hammer must handle their grammar, And nightmen account for eclipses, Our handicraft neighbours shall share in our labours If they leave us the whole of the honey, And the sans-culotte caitiff shall start for the plate, if He puts in no claim to plate-money. Ye Halls, on whose dais the Don of to-day is To feed on the beef and the benison, Ye Common-room glories, where beneficed Tories Digest their belief and their venison, Ye duels scholastic, where quibbles monastic Are asserted with none to confute them, Ye grave Congregations, where frequent taxations Are settled with none to dispute them— Far hence be the season when Radical treason Of port and of pudding shall bilk ye, When the weavers aforesaid shall taste of our boar's head, The silk-winders swallow our silky, When the mob shall eat faster than any Vicemaster, The watermen try to out-tope us, When Campbell shall dish up a bowl of our bishop, Or Brougham and Co. cope with our copus. XV. AN EPITAPH ON THE LATE KING OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS. BY CRAZEE RATTEE, ESQ., HIS MAJESTY'S POET LAUREATE. Beneath the marble, mud, or moss, Whiche'er his subjects shall determine, Entombed in eulogies and dross, The Island King is food for vermin. Preserved by scribblers and by salt From Lethe and sepulchral vapours, His body fills his father's vault, His character the daily papers. Well was he framed for royal seat; Kind—to the meanest of his creatures, With tender heart and tender feet, And open purse and open features; The ladies say who laid him out, And earned thereby the usual pensions, They never wreathed a shroud about A corpse of more genteel dimensions. He warred with half-a-score of foes, And shone—by proxy—in the quarrel; Enjoyed hard fights and soft repose, And deathless debt, and deathless laurel; His enemies were scalped and flayed Whene'er his subjects were victorious, And widows wept, and paupers paid, To make their Sovereign ruler glorious. And days were set apart for thanks, And prayers were said by pious readers, And laud was lavished on the ranks, And laurel lavished on their leaders. Events are writ by History's pen, Though causes are too much to care for; Fame talks about the where and when, While Folly asks the why and wherefore. In peace he was intensely gay, And indefatigably busy, Preparing gewgaws every day, And shows, to make his subjects dizzy; And hearing the report of guns, And signing the report of gaolers, And making up receipts for buns And patterns for the army tailors, And building carriages and boats And streets and chapels and pavilions, And regulating all the coats And all the principles of millions, And drinking homilies and gin, And chewing pork and adulation, And looking backwards upon sin, And looking forwards to salvation. The people, in his happy reign, Were blest beyond all other nations: Unharmed by foreign axe or chain, Unhealed by civil innovations; They served the usual logs and stones With all the usual rites and terrors, And swallowed all their father's bones, And swallowed all their father's errors, When the fierce mob, with clubs and knives, All swore that nothing should prevent them, But that their representatives Should actually represent them, He interposed the proper checks, By sending troops, with drums and banners, To cut their speeches short, and necks, And break their heads, to mend their manners. And when Dissension flung her stain Upon the light of Hymen's altar, And Destiny made Hymen's chain As galling as the hangman's halter, He passed a most domestic life, By many mistresses befriended, And did not put away his wife, For fear the priest should be offended. And thus at last he sank to rest Amid the blessings of his people, And sighs were heard from every heart, And bells were tolled from every steeple; And loud was every public throng His public character adorning, And poets raised a mourning song, And clothiers raised the price of mourning. His funeral was very grand, Followed by many robes and maces, And all the great ones of the land Struggling as heretofore, for places; And every loyal Minister Was there, with signs of purse-felt sorrow, Save Pozzy, his lord-chancellor, Who promised to attend “to-morrow.” Peace to his dust. His fostering care By grateful hearts shall long be cherished; And all his subjects shall declare They lost a grinder when he perished. They who shall look upon the lead Wherein a people's love hath shrined him, Will say—when all the worst is said, Perhaps he leaves a worse behind him! XVII. THE CHAUNTS OF THE BRAZEN HEAD. II. Bet half the British Parliament To twice the British Forum; Or Sugden's lengthy argument To Brocard's scant decorum; Or Mori's most astounding art To Robin's rustic tabor; Or twenty bars from old Mozart To twenty scores from Weber. Bet giants' clubs to kitchen brooms, Or swords to kitchen pokers, Or Canning's wit to Mr. Hume's, Or Scott's to Mr. Croker's; Or Laura's smile, so bright and gay, To ocean's richest jewel, Or Brougham's desire of place and pay To Brougham's desire of duel. Bet honest Wisdom's lightest thought To Folly's deepest knowledge; Or what is proper to be taught To what is taught—at college; Or rotten eggs to rotten votes, Or Englishmen to Germans, Or half-a-dozen of Wentworth's notes To half a quire of Burmann's. Bet turtle-soup to vulgar tripe, Or Regent Street to Holborn Or puffs from a tobacco-pipe To puffs from Mr. Colburn; Or venison to a crust of bread, Or perigords to fritters, Or Friar Bacon's Brazen Head To all the gold that glitters. XVIII. THE CHAUNTS OF THE BRAZEN HEAD. III. The world pursues the very track Which it pursued at its creation; And mortals shrink in horror back From any hint of innovation; From year to year the children do Exactly what their sires have done; Time is—Time was—there's nothing new— There's nothing new beneath the sun! Still lovers hope to be believed, Still clients hope to win their causes; Still plays and farces are received With most encouraging applauses; Still dancers have fantastic toes, Still dandies shudder at a dun; Still diners have their fricandeaus— There's nothing new beneath the sun. Still cooks torment the hapless eels, Still boys torment the dumb cockchafers; Lord Eldon still adores the seals, Lord Clifford still adores the wafers; Still asses have enormous ears, Still gambling bets are lost and won; Still opera dancers marry peers— There's nothing new beneath the sun. Still women are absurdly weak, Still infants dote upon a rattle; Still Mr. Martin cannot speak Of anything but beaten cattle; Still brokers swear the shares will rise, Still Cockneys boast of Manton's gun; Still listeners swallow monstrous lies— There's nothing new beneath the sun. Still genius is a jest to Earls, Still honesty is down to zero; Still heroines have spontaneous curls, Still novels have a handsome hero; Still Madame Vestris plays a man, Still fools adore her—I for one; Still youths write sonnets to a fan— There's nothing new beneath the sun. Still people make a plaguy fuss About all things that don't concern them, As if it matters aught to us What happens to our grandsons, burn them! Still life is nothing to the dead; Still Folly's toil is Wisdom's fun; And still, except the Brazen Head, There's nothing new beneath the sun. XX. THE DEATH OF CANNING. VIII. AUGUST MDCCCXXVII. Ay, mourn to-day! but mourn for those Whose rights his arm defended; Whose foes were his and Freedom's foes Where'er the names were blended; For the serf, whose rest from toil and pain His mercy might have spoken; For the slave, whose cold and galling chain His vengeance might have broken; For Helle's stream, where the Pasha's flag Still waves o'er the sacred water; For Erin's huts, where the Orange rag Is still the sign of slaughter. Ay, mourn to-day! but not for him; His name is writ in story, Ere a single cloud could make more dim The noon-day of its glory. Victor in boyhood's early game And youth's career of gladness, Victor in manhood's lists of fame O'er envy, hate, and madness, What could he hope in other years, If the longest life had crowned him, But thus to die, with a nation's tears And a world's applause around him? The laurel wreath upon his brow Might have looked less green to-morrow; But the leaves will bloom for ever now, They are newly twined by sorrow. The sighs that are whispered o'er his clay May weary Heaven's Recorder; But none are glad, save the Turk's Serai, And a few of Lord Grey's “Order”! XXI. THE RIDDLES OF THE SPHINX. 'Twas night; the House was cleared, And hushed the fierce debate, And robed in clouds the Sphinx appeared Before St. Stephen's gate. A virgin's face above, A lion's form beneath, Upon those lips was maiden love, Within those claws was death. She look'd on that high Hall With a grim and scornful smile; And vapours passed like a funeral pall O'er Heaven's expanse the while; And the moon went back that hour In an unforetold eclipse, As the words of mystery and power Fell from the marble lips. “Can ye teach the Owl to meet The light of the morning skies? Can ye make the rays of reason sweet To a bigot's blinking eyes? Can ye bar the lightning's track With a canopy of cloth? Can ye beat a nation's fury back With Bibles and cheap broth? “Can ye count the grains of sand On Ocean's stormy beach, Or the blunders that Lord Westmoreland Makes in a single speech? Can ye read what words are writ On the tombs of sacred Nile, Or construe Mr. Bankes's wit, When he makes the gallery smile? “What drove Lord Melville out? What made Lord Bexley stay? And why does Londonderry spout? And why do asses bray? Why does the morning dawn When Phœbus takes his seat? And why does all the peerage yawn When Redesdale talks of wheat? “How shall the blind discern That black is never white? How shall a rotten borough learn That wrong is never right? How shall fair health be sought In the shade of a upas tree, Or how shall honest deeds be wrought In Sarum or Tralee? “Why does the Earth turn round? And why does the Morning Post? And when will the longitude be found, Or the art of reigning lost? And when will ice be warm? And when will wrath be cool? And when will love be not a charm, And a minstrel not a fool?” While cards were cut in the Hell, And capers on the stage, While night on the monarch's palace fell, And on the student's page, The riddling Sphinx thus sung Her how, and when, and why, And like Sir Thomas, questions flung With none to make reply. XXII. THE OUTS. When Eldon can a judgment pass In less than half an age, When Westmoreland eschews a lass, And Melville patronage, When Peel forsakes his bigotry And gives free thought the rein, When Bathurst rears a colony— They may come back again. When Bexley ceases to be saint, And Wetherell to prose, When Manners, free of Orange taint, Shakes hands with Popish foes, When Lethbridge, dropping thoughts of pelf, In patriotic vein, Can England substitute for self, They may come back again. When Londonderry, matchless peer, His pension-hope outlives, When Newcastle the cause shall hear Before he verdict gives, When Ellenborough's sage replies Shall rival Canning's strain, And beardless Castlereagh grow wise, They may come back again. When Cobbett, guiltless of hard names, Pays debts with effort stoic, And when the Post Fitzgerald shames In spouting mock heroic; When Southey, fixed at last in creed, Shall other change disdain, When Lees from Romish fears is freed, They may come back again. When honest men in lawyers thrive, And Law knows no delay; When Tory institutes outlive The Chart of Liberty; When Britons, pining for his rule, Import a King from Spain— The worthy head for such a school, They may come back again. XXIII. THE RETROSPECT. When Pitt was Premier, well-a-day! I chanted Io Pœans, And held the loftiest Whigs at bay As well as base plebeians. I filled old Jacobins with awe, Distorting fact and reason, Whene'er 'twas wished to twist the law Or find constructive treason. I raved at all Republicans, Detested snobbish hooters, Got flattery from partisans, And fees from Chancery suitors; Reform I constantly decried, Pronounced the truth a libel, On working days to briefs applied, On Sundays read my Bible. At length my loyalty was such It could but be rewarded; And, as I ne'er expected much, A trifle was accorded. Content the humble boon I took, A coronet and pension, And on the woolsack proudly shook An Earldom's full dimension. I kept the conscience of the king With Protestant discernment; And showed that freedom was a thing Fit only for adjournment; That granting rights to Catholics Would be a dreadful omen, And millions—say some five or six— Were positively no men. In short, there's nothing more required Than bayonets and bullets, At reasonable prices hired, To stop those Irish gullets; But God forbid I e'er should be Like that vile Popish Bonner, Who roasted folks for heresy, And for the Church's honour! I would not burn the wretches—faugh! But hanging, drawing, quart'ring Are quite agreeable to law Which disapproves of tort'ring; And really, if they will persist In actions contumacious, Why then increase the Army List, And shoot the most audacious! But ah, the times are changed! and now, Repenting old oppressions, Majorities are bound to bow In favour of concessions; Yet I will still consistent be, Intolerant and Tory, And go down to posterity In pure and perfect glory, XXIV. BIGOTRY'S REMONSTRANCE. 'Twas dead midnight, when Bigotry came With Philpotts for her guide, And shook her torch of sulphury flame At old John Scott's bedside. “Awake!” she said, “for my soul is sick, Our throne is crumbling fast, And Common Sense the heretic Is rending my chain at last. “Yet Lethbridge is peacefully going to sleep, As most of his hearers do, And Goulburn sits in a reverie deep, Dreaming of two times two. “And dandies are carelessly sipping the froth From the Sillery in Pall Mall, And Crocky is happily laying the cloth For the layers of odds in Hell. “They are blinded all by Priests and Popes, They do not pity Peel; They have ceased to fear O'Connell's tropes, And the metaphors of Sheil. “Awake, John Scott; once more advance For the Church and Constitution, The Champion still of Ignorance, The Child of Persecution. “And quail not thou for wrath or scorn; I bring thee arms to-night Of stouter mould than ever were worn By Thetis' son in fight: “The sword of falsehood, to contend That Lansdowne's white is black; The shield of dulness strong, to send The jests of Holland back: “Abuse, which seems to the Tory host The language of sobriety, And cant, which sounds to the Morning Post Like the tone of the truest piety. “Go feign and flatter, preach and croak, Beseech, reprove, upbraid; And ever and anon invoke Thy Frederic's holy shade. “Tell of the faggots of ancient years Lit up by Monk and Friar, Shed, if thou canst, appropriate tears, And call Lord King a liar. “Then lull their Lordships to repose With a quibble or a pun; There's a proper theme in a nation's woes For a Merry-Andrew's fun. “His Majesty shall clasp thy hand When the hallowed strife is o'er, And the princely lungs of Cumberland Shall give thee one cheer more!” XXVI. WATERLOO. “On this spot the French cavalry charged, and broke the English squares!”—Narrative of a French Tourist. “Is it true, think you?”—Winter's Tale. Ay, here such valorous deeds were done As ne'er were done before; Ay, here the reddest wreath was won That ever Gallia wore; Since Ariosto's wondrous Knight Made all the Paynims dance, There never dawned a day so bright As Waterloo's on France. The trumpet poured its deafening sound, Flags fluttered on the gale, And cannon roared, and heads flew round As fast as summer hail; The sabres flashed their light of fear, The steeds began to prance; The English quaked from front to rear— They never quake in France! The cuirassiers rode in and out As fierce as wolves and bears; 'Twas grand to see them slash about Among the English squares! And then the Polish Lancer came Careering with his lance; No wonder Britain blushed for shame, And ran away from France! The Duke of York was killed that day; The king was sadly scarred; Lord Eldon, as he ran away, Was taken by the Guard; Poor Wellington with fifty Blues Escaped by some mischance; Henceforth I think he'll hardly choose To show himself in France. So Buonaparte pitched his tent That night in Grosvenor Place, And Ney rode straight to Parliament And broke the Speaker's mace; “Vive l' Empereur” was said and sung From Peebles to Penzance; The Mayor and Aldermen were hung; Which made folks laugh in France. They pulled the Tower of London down; They burnt our wooden walls; They brought the Pope himself to town And lodged him in St. Paul's; And Gog and Magog rubbed their eyes, Awaking from a trance, And grumbled out, in great surprise, “Oh mercy! we're in France!” They sent a Regent to our Isle, The little King of Rome; And squibs and crackers all the while Blazed in the Place Vendôme; And ever since, in arts and power, They're making great advance; They've had strong beer from that glad hour, And sea-coal fires, in France. My uncle, Captain Flanigan, Who lost a leg in Spain, Tells stories of a little man Who died at St. Helène; But bless my heart, they can't be true; I'm sure they're all romance; John Bull was beat at Waterloo! They'll swear to that in France. XXVII. MARS DISARMED BY LOVE. Ay, bear it hence, thou blessed child, Though dire the burden be And hide it in the pathless wild, Or drown it in the sea! The ruthless murderer prays and swears— So let him swear and pray! Be deaf to all his oaths and prayers, And take the sword away. We've had enough of fleets and camps, Guns, glories, odes, gazettes, Triumphal arches, coloured lamps, Huzzas and epaulettes; We could not bear upon our head Another leaf of bay; That horrid Buonaparte's dead; Yes, take the sword away. We're weary of the noisy boasts That pleased our patriot throngs; We've long been dull to Gooch's toasts, And deaf to Dibdin's songs; We're quite content to rule the wave Without a great display; We're known to be extremely brave; But take the sword away. We give a shrug when pipe and drum Play up a favourite air; We think our barracks are become More ugly than they were; We laugh to see the banners float; We loathe the charger's bray; We don't admire a scarlet coat; Do take the sword away! Let Portugal have rulers twain, Let Greece go on with none, Let Popery sink or swim in Spain While we enjoy the fun; Let Turkey tremble at the knout, Let Algiers lose her Dey, Let Paris turn her Bourbons out; Bah! take the sword away. Our honest friends in Parliament Are looking vastly sad; Our farmers say with one consent It's all immensely bad; There was a time for borrowing, And now it's time to pay; A budget is a serious thing; So, take the sword away. And oh the bitter tears we wept In those our days of fame— The dread that o'er our heart-strings crept With every post that came— The home-affections waged and lost In many a far-off fray— The price that British glory cost! Ah, take the sword away! We've plenty left to hoist the sail, Or dare the dangerous breach, And Freedom breathes in every gale That wanders round our beach. When Duty bids us dare or die, We'll fight, another day; But till we know the reason why, Take—take the sword away!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part II. 1830–1834. I. THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS. “Incipient magni procedere menses.”—Virg. We're sick of this distressing state Of order and repose; We have not had enough of late Of blunders, or of blows; We can't endure to pass our life In such a humdrum way; We want a little pleasant strife— The Whigs are in to-day! Our worthy fathers were content With all the world's applause; They thought they had a parliament, And liberty, and laws. It's no such thing; we've wept and groaned Beneath a despot's sway; We've all been whipped, and starved, and stoned— The Whigs are in to-day! We used to fancy Englishmen Had broken Europe's chain, And won a battle, now and then, Against the French in Spain; Oh no! we never ruled the waves, Whatever people say; We've all been despicable slaves— The Whigs are in to-day! It's time for us to see the things Which other folk have seen; It's time we should cashier our kings, And build our guillotine; We'll abrogate Police and Peers, And vote the Church away; We'll hang the parish overseers— The Whigs are in to-day! We'll put the landlords to the rout; We'll burn the College Halls; We'll turn St. James's inside out, And batter down St. Paul's. We'll hear no more of Bench or Bar; The troops shall have no pay: We'll turn adrift our men of war— The Whigs are in to-day! We fear no bayonet or ball From those who fight for hire; For Baron Brougham has told them all On no account to fire. Lord Tenterden looks vastly black; But Baron Brougham, we pray, Will strip the ermine from his back— The Whigs are in to-day! Go pluck the jewels from the Crown, The colours from the mast, And let the Three per Cents. come down— We can but break at last. If Cobbett is the first of men, The second is Lord Grey; Oh must we not be happy, when The Whigs are in to-day! II. THE CONVERT. Good Lady Grace, the charming Blue, Who lately loved, in Grosvenor Square, To lecture to a favoured few On birds and fishes, light and air, Now flings her learned toys away, And spells the wisdom of the Sun, And whispers fifty times a day, “Dear cousin, something must be done!” She fears the rabble scarcely grow A jot less apt to drink and swear; She vows that Hume and Brougham and Co. Are just as shocking as they were; What once she said of Mr. Grey She says as plainly of his son; She talks of Cobbett with dismay; But bless her! something must be done. She thinks as fondly as she thought Of those that sailed with old Pellew; She can't conceive that bondsmen fought With Wellington at Waterloo; She boasts of Britain's old renown, Her dangers dared, her laurels won, Her blameless Church, her bloodless Crown; Alas! but something must be done. She finds that speeches still are made, And laws, and quartern loaves, and rhymes; She finds the Three per Cents. are paid, As they were paid in olden times; She don't believe she's older now Than when she laughed at Canning's fun; But yet, no matter why or how, She's sure that something must be done. Come, ye who have been blind so long, And see, by wisdom's modern light, Whatever has been, may be wrong, Whatever is not, must be right. Lord Brougham is in Lord Eldon's place; The Whig millennium is begun; Who would not vote, with Lady Grace, That somehow something must be done? III. ODE TO POPULARITY. “Quis multâ gracilis te puer in rosâ Perfusus liquidis urget odoribus, Grato, Pyrrha, sub antro?” —Hor., I. 3. O fondest—and O frailest fair That ever made a poet swear, Bewitching Popularity! O patroness of songs and scents, Of budgets and disfranchisements, Of treason and vulgarity— Tell me whom now your fickle pen Pronounces first of mortal men In magazine or journal? For whom the golden lute you wake, And whose renown you mean to make For just nine weeks eternal? Dote you on Grey's experienced brow, Because he's quite as silly now As erst our fathers found him? Or do you lead the approving cheer When Baron Brougham, the peerless peer, Is flinging dirt around him? Does soft Sir James, by talking big Of rope and cable, sloop and brig, Persuade you he's a hero? Or does Sir Thomas please you more By telling, as he told before, The history of Nero? O Waterloo! You used to say You never would forget the day That cracked the French cuirasses; But Wednesday last, at half-past ten, You let the ragged gentlemen Smash all his Grace's glasses. You know you've jilted St. John Long, And bidden Southwark's noisy throng Send poor Sir Robert packing; You know, without a reason why, You're burning Hunt in effigy, And leaving off his blacking. Happy on whom untried you smile! He dreams not for how short a while You solemnize the wedding; How soon you jump from wreaths to stones, From Wellington to Colonel Jones, From kissing to beheading. Such stormy waves are not for me; As Graham says, I've seen the sea Suck down the struggling packet; And I renounce the sail and oar, And hang to dry upon the shore My trousers and my jacket. IV. THE COMPLAINT OF LIBERTY. “Lord!” said the little woman, “this can be none of I”—Old Song. “O Liberty! whose radiant charms Were so adored by Thebes and Sparta— Bright patroness of arts and arms, And authoress of Magna Charta— Nymph! for whose sake, as we are taught, In Plutarch's entertaining stories, Speeches were made, and battles fought, By Greek and Roman, Whigs and Tories; “Come hither with your pen and sword, Your russet garb and mess of pottage; Leave the wild Arab's wandering horde, Or the rude Switzer's humble cottage; Let Lafayette console Lafitte; Let Congress sit a day without you; Smile, smile, for once, on Downing Street I want to write an ode about you!” She came—she answered. Well I know The Speaker's awful call to order; I heard, some thirteen years ago, A sentence from the late Recorder; I know how hoarse the cheerers are, When Whig lords prate of right intention; But, oh! that fearful voice was far More fearful than the sounds I mention. “I come,” she said, “the same who erst Held talk with Xenophon and Plato; Taught Brutus to be firm, and nurst The fire of high resolve in Cato; The same who on your island rock Have mocked the hand of sceptred power; Who went with Sidney to the block, And with the Bishops to the Tower. “Alas! my handmaids, in such days, Were Wisdom, Order, and Sobriety; What loathsome change! My Broughams and Greys Have dragged me into strange society; Treason and Strife invoke my name In their dark plots and drunken quarrels; I'm growing weary of my fame; And Jove! how ill I look in laurels! “I am not what I was; I throw Prodigious stones in Clare and Kerry; I cheat the Greeks with prudent Joe; I maximize with sapient Jerry; Last winter, I confess, I taught The labouring class the art of arson, And oft on Sundays I've been caught With Taylor screaming out “No parson!” “It's true that still the schoolboy's prayers Come up to me in so-so Latin; And still the lying Courier swears That all my rags are silk and satin; And I've a friend at Court, I think; But he will doom me to the halter, When once he hears me in my drink Speak out about the throne and altar. “Farewell! my anguish would defy E'en Althorp's powers of clear expression; I'm quite convinced that I shall die Before the closing of the session; I'd go with pleasure to the grave; But oh! the thought is overpowering— They tell me I am sure to have An epitaph from Doctor Bowring!” V. WHY AND WHEREFORE. “Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.”—Shakespeare. I was a Tory once, you know, A king and constitution man; But that was many years ago, Before the march of mind began. 'Twas very well to be a dunce When no one asked me why or how; I own, I was a Tory once; But Lord! I'm not a Tory now. The schoolmaster's abroad, you see; And, when the people hear him speak, They all insist on being free, And reading Homer in the Greek; The Bolton weavers seize the pen, The Sussex farmers scorn the plough; One must advance with other men; And so, I'm not a Tory now. Look at the papers! There you'll find The Courier full of Cobbett's taunts; Lord Palmerston has changed his mind; And what's become of both the Grants? How should I hope to stem the storm Which makes such mighty statesmen bow? Why, Goderich is for this Reform! And who would be a Tory now? And then, the people are stark mad! They go about with sticks and stones! And these accounts are very bad Of broken glass and broken bones; Poor Cockburn had some shocking hurts; I never could endure a row; They tore Sir Roger Gresley's skirts! No, no, I'm not a Tory now. You know my nephew—clever youth— He came last year from Harrow school; He's done a pamphlet which, in truth, Makes out that I've been quite a fool. Pray read this little page, about The healthy trunk and rotten bough; It proves, beyond the smallest doubt, No patriot is a Tory now. I'll introduce you to my wife; She brought me fifty thousand pounds; And she's the blessing of my life, Although she made me cut the hounds. She reads the Herald every day, And talks—'twould do you good, I vow; She's very partial to Lord Grey; How can I be a Tory now? Tom wants a living—what of that? Brougham never heard me urge his claims. And Hal's appointed to the Rat! But—Sir! I never asked Sir James. Oh no! I like the Church and Laws; And—candidly, you must allow That I have shown sufficient cause Why I am not a Tory now. VI. KING ALFRED'S BOOK. “His mighty genius prompted him to undertake a most great and necessary work, which he is said to have executed in as masterly a manner;—no less than to new model the Constitution,—to rebuild it on a plan that should endure for ages.”—History of England. I saw in a dream, on a summer day, The tomb where the Saxon Solon lay; And thither the prince of the land was led, With the robe on his shoulder, the crown on his head; And they bade him draw from its secret nook The volume of law, King Alfred's Book. He held the tome in his feeble grasp; He broke the seals, and he snapped the clasp. Long years had marred on the dim, dim page The treasured truth of the Chief and Sage; And whose were the hands that undertook To write new words in the holy book? A laurelled warrior thither came; How the deep heart thrilled as they named his name! He gazed on the volume of right and law, And he turned away from the sight he saw, Falsehood and blame he would rather brook, Than sully one page of the time-worn book. A statesman came, and through the crowd The murmur of hope was heard aloud; “Let him trace but a line, and the peril is o'er, And the leaves shall sleep where they slept before.” Power and praise his heart forsook; He turned away from the fearful book. I saw a hoary dotard stand, And grasp the pen in his feeble hand; He had written a rare bold text, they said, Ere the white snows fell on his plotting head; But now he was grey, and his fingers shook, As he scrawled and scrawled on the sacred book. “I have brought,” quoth a schoolboy, “this ruler of mine, To rule for the letters a fair straight line.” He babbled of parish, he babbled of town, And the ruler went up, and the ruler went down; So crooked was never the crookedest crook As the line he drew on the wondrous book. There came a sallow penman now, With a sneer on his lip and a scowl on his brow; So quick was his hand, that you saw at a glance He had learned of the cunning scribes of France: “Might” for “right” his haste mistook, And “treason” for “reason” he wrote in the book. And there was a schoolmaster, tall and thin, With a solemn smile on his nose and chin; He smoothed the leaf, and he mended the pen, And he rapped the knuckles now and then; “How scared,” quoth he,” the dolts will look If ever they read what they write in the book!” “Oh, write what ye may, or write what ye will,” Said the cry of a mob from a cotton-mill; “The words may be grave, and the wit may be good; But we're building the gallows, and lighting the wood: The bird to the snare, and the fish to the hook, And a rope for the clerks, and a fire for the book!” VII. INTENTIONS. A REMONSTRANCE IN THE VENTILATOR. Now don't abuse us, Fanny, don't; You're really too provoking! I won't sit by, I vow I won't, To hear your idle croaking. You seem to think the world is mad For places and for pensions, And won't believe—it's quite too bad— That Whigs have good intentions. I know that Denman is too rash, And Graham not too witty; I know we hear prodigious trash From members for the City; Young Thomson is a financier Of rather small dimensions; Lord Althorp is not vastly clear: But all have bright intentions. The Budget was a slight mistake; You call it quite correctly; But then confess, for candour's sake, We gave it up directly. They laughed it down on every side, Forgetting their dissensions; But not a single man denied It shewed the best intentions. The Premier has been kind, I own, To most of his connections; But Hunt, you see, was quite alone In making harsh reflections. The blockhead ought to go to school And study his declensions; Then he would judge by better rule A statesman's grand intentions. It's true we've not been doing much To make the Frenchman humble; And after all those dear, dull Dutch Have cause enough to grumble. We cannot see—who says we can? Through Talleyrand's inventions; For he's a wicked, clever man; And we—have pure intentions. And Fanny—as for this Reform, Which Peel pronounces treason, Indeed I think you make a storm Without sufficient reason. The Bill is full of faults no doubt, But, as my husband mentions, One would not have a fault struck out Which flows from just intentions. Some say the Bill destroys the Crown; Some swear it galls the people; Some see the peerage tumbling down, Some fear for Church and steeple. There may be good substantial cause For many apprehensions; But coûte que coûte, in every clause There's proof of right intentions. We can't expect that Brougham and Hume Will lay their horrid plans down. But, dearest love, you won't assume The fault is with Lord Lansdowne! They can't do harm—or if they do, In spite of wise preventions, I hate their schemes, but, entre nous, I honour their intentions. VIII. THE BEGGAR'S PETITION. “Extremum Tanain si biberes, Lyce,” etc.—Hor., III. 10. If you were placed in some rude station Where no man sighs for stars or garters, Where Papists shrink from agitation, And Whigs have some respect for charters, Still, still, Lord Grey, I'd not be guessing Why, in your foolish prides and glories, You'd keep a friend without a blessing, Placeless and payless, with the Tories. Ah, don't you see with what barbarity The members all around me treat me? Knight's look is not a look of charity; Sir Edward Sugden longs to beat me; Croker, bad luck to him, is witty, And Wetherell is entirely teazing, And Peel, without a spark of pity, Sets, now and then, my heart's blood freezing. Och! don't be proud! Sure, cool reflection Should cure your scoffing and your scorning; The wheel may turn, and my affection, Just like the Bill, get lost, some morning: And though the Duke might look severely On me and my Associators, Musha! your father's son should dearly Esteem all demagogues and traitors. Be warned; though you are cold and cruel, Though deputations don't persuade you, Though you are yet unshaken, jewel, By all the compliments I've paid you; Though you are deaf to Grattan's speeches Which flow as ceaseless as the Shannon, And blind to those unwilling breaches Of discipline in sad Duncannon, Be wise in time. O stubborn-hearted! Regardless, as an oak, of blarney! Deaf, as the adders, that departed Some years ago, from sweet Killarney! Be wise in time! You won't? Oh murther! An't we all patriots, stout and manly? My Lord, we won't put up much further With bows, and frowns, and Master Stanley. IX. SPEECH OF THE IRISH SECRETARY IN DEFENCE OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT. “On, Stanley, on.”—Marmion Sir, we have closed our long campaign Against the troops of Cold Blow Lane; We've done with Mr. Grattan's votes, Their venal hearts and ragged coats; And it is time for me to show The Castle folk are unsunned snow, And prove, howe'er the case appears, His Lordship never interferes. One Long, a mean and paltry knave, By reason of the vote he gave, Has lost most justly, as he feels, The mending of his Lordship's wheels. Out on the villain! By my troth, We won't believe a tradesmen's oath, When he, the Prince of British Peers, Declares he never interferes! As for the lines his Lordship wrote, To say that every honest vote Was, as was very right and fair, Requested here, expected there— I own it was extremely wrong To be so kind to Mr. Long; Yet in that letter, who that hears Will say, his Lordship interferes? And then, the melancholy fates Or those poor perjured magistrates, Who were so wonderfully rude, And talked of friends, and gratitude: The men, it's certain, went and did Exactly as the men were bid; But Sir, with Mr. Tyndale's tears The Castle never interferes. Honest Basseggio next attacks— The barber—with his battle-axe! Who vomits speeches brave and big Against whate'er is wise and Whig; I'm sure that none who know the case, And how the barber lost his place, Can deem with such plebeian fears His Lordship ever interferes. Oh, I appeal to all the fame That crowns that noble person's name; And I appeal to Captain Hart, Who could not play the bully's part; And I appeal to Baron Tuyll, Who sealed his lips up all the while; And I appeal to those loud cheers— His Lordship never interferes. All people, Mr. Speaker, know Which way his Lordship's wishes go; And Government, it's also known, Do as they will with what's their own: And since my noble friend is right To interfere with all his might— I care not for those vulgar sneers— He never, never interferes. X. SPEECH DELIVERED BY A WORTHY ALDERMAN, SEVERAL TIMES, IN COMMITTEE ON THE REFORM BILL. I do not rise—I never will— To make a speech about the Bill; I only want to urge once more What I have often urged before; It can't be doubted or denied, That members on the other side Are talking, talking, day by day, Just for the purpose of delay. Why, Sir, the nation, as we know, Passed all the Bill some months ago; And my constituents, Sir, object To any members who reflect; And therefore I am bold to state I disapprove of all debate, And sit in absolute dismay When I observe so much delay. Oh Mr. Bernal, don't forget The burden of our monstrous debt! Consider, Sir, how every year Taxation's growing more severe; I must assert that I, for one, Believe the country quite undone; Some fools dispute it—so they may; But I protest against delay. Why, Sir, I'll venture to advance We were some years at war with France; And now Britannia's flag is furled, And we're at peace with all the world. All honourable members ought To think as much as I have thought; Then they would work the shortest way, And pass the Bill without delay. And I'm prepared to prove, I trust, That every word is true and just In all the speeches I have made On import and on export trade. Official values, I admit, Are things beyond my humble wit; But all these things, I'm sure, display The dangerous folly of delay. And Sir, I don't dislike a clause Because it's full of faults and flaws; And Sir, I think it's most perverse To prate of better, or of worse; And Sir, I find, though members laugh, Too many lawyers here, by half; And Sir, I shall advise Lord Grey To gag them all without delay. I should be very glad to touch Upon the French, the Poles, and Dutch And tell you why I think it sin To let the foreign silks come in; But I have always thought it right To keep the question full in sight And I should be ashamed to play The game of men who want delay Sir, I conclude, as I began, By begging every honest man To end the nation's doubts and fears, And hold his tongue, and stop his ears. Of argument we've had enough; It's very sudorific stuff; And I have one thing more to say— I can't account for this delay. XI. THE BILL, THE WHOLE BILL, AND NOTHING BUT THE BILL. Come listen, come listen, I'm going to sing A song that's much newer than “God save the King;” All about what I think of this wonderful Bill, Which hasn't passed yet—can you guess when it will? Derry down. I hear it's to work us more wonders, some day, Than Harlequin's wand ever did in the play; It's to make kings and queens out of Jack and of Jill: Will it ever do this? Why, I don't think it will. Derry down. It's to make us new clothes, as I've heard people tell: A shirt for myself, and a bonnet for Nell; A bonnet with ribbands, a shirt with a frill; Will it come to be true? I'll be hanged if it will! Derry down. It's to light us a fire, and lay us a bed; It's to pave Holborn Hill with the best wheaten bread; It's to bring down fine Hollands to nothing a gill— Believe, if you like; I'll be whipped if I will. Derry down. It's to heal all disorders, wherever it goes, In the feet and the hands, in the eyes and the nose; It's to cure gout and ague, instead of a pill. Some folks say it won't; but Lord John says it will. Derry down. It's to give to the troops, and the tars of the fleet, No jacket to wear, and no pudding to eat; When we've just done away with the mess and the drill, Will we lick the Mounseers? Ask the Duke if we will. Derry down. It's to get us a parson, as good as St. Paul, Who won't want a lodging or dinner at all; He'll teach us our duties and preach us our fill, But as for his tithes—he may starve, if he will. Derry down. It's to give us—good luck to it! freedom and trade; Our goods will be sold, and our debts will be paid. It will conjure up wealth for the ledger and till— I wish I could only find out how it will! Derry down. It will bring health to sickness, and warmth to the cold, And wit to the foolish, and youth to the old, And soup to the saucepan, and grist to the mill— Fine words, honest friends! But I doubt if it will. Derry down. It's to change, in a minute, one guinea to ten; It's to marry our daughters to handsome young men; It's to make me a singer of science and skill. If you trust all the rest, don't you trust that it will? Derry down. And now here's success to the ancient old cause Of the King and the People, the Land and the Laws; And the Devil fly away with the Whigs and the Bill! (Don't say that I said it) I fancy he will! Derry down. XII. REASONS FOR NOT RATTING. “Sound opinions are like sound wine, they are the better for keeping.”—Speech of Lord Dudley, 5th October, 1831. It was my father's wine. Alas, It was his chiefest bliss To fill an old friend's evening glass With nectar such as this! I think I have as warm a heart— As kind a friend as he. Another bumper ere we part! Old wine—old wine for me! In this we toasted William Pitt, Whom twenty now outshine; O'er this we laughed at Canning's wit, Ere Hume's was thought as fine. In this “The King!” “The Church!” “The Laws!” Have had their three times three. Sound wine befits as sound a cause; Old wine—old wine for me! In this, when France in those long wars Was beaten black and blue, We used to drink our troops and tars— Our Wellesley and Pellew. Now, things are changed. Though Britain's fame May out of fashion be, At least my wine remains the same. Old wine—old wine for me. My neighbours, Robinson and Lamb, Drink French of last year's growth: I'm sure, however they may sham, It disagrees with both. I don't pretend to interfere; An Englishman is free; But none of that cheap poison here! Old wine—old wine for me. Some dozens lose, I must allow, Something of strength and hue; And there are vacant spaces now, To be filled up with new; And there are cobwebs round the bins, Which some don't like to see; If these are all my cellar's sins, Old wine—old wine for me! XIII. THE OLD TORY. “Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem Testa diu.”—Hor. Aye, chatter, chatter, brother Sam; Call Thomson deep and Sheil divine; And tell us all that Master Cam Is quite a Tully in his line. I'm near threescore; you ought to know You can't transplant so old a tree; I was a Tory long ago; You'll hardly make a Whig of me. Lord Palmerston may turn about, And curse the creed he held so long; And moral Grant may now find out That Canning was extremely wrong: Lansdowne with Waithman may unite, And Ministers with mobs agree; Truth may be falsehood, black grow white, But, sir, you make no Whig of me. You know I never learned to trust The wisdom of the Scotch Review; I worshipped not Napoleon's bust; I could not blush for Waterloo: I'm proud of England's glory still, Of laurels won on land and sea; Call me a bigot if you will, But pray don't make a Whig of me. I cannot march with Attwood's ranks, I cannot write with Russell's pen, I have no longing for the thanks Of very loyal tithing-men; I cannot wear a civil face When Carpue just drops in to tea; I cannot flatter Mr. Place; You'll never make a Whig of me. I can't admire the Bristol rows, Nor call the Common Council wise; I cannot bow as Burdett bows, Nor lie as great O'Connell lies; And if I wanted place or pay, A Baron's robe, or Bishop's see, I'm not first cousin to Lord Grey— Why should you make a Whig of me? Good brother, 'twere an easier thing To make a wit of Joseph Hume, To make a conjuror of Lord King, To make a lawyer of Lord Brougham. No, Howick will be half his sire, And Althorp learn the Rule of Three, And Morpeth set the Thames on fire, Before you make a Whig of me! XIV. THE YOUNG WHIG. Oh yes, he is in Parliament, He's been returning thanks; You can't conceive the time he's spent In giving people franks; He's grown a most important man, His name's in the Gazette; And, though he swears he never can— I'm sure he will—forget. He talks quite grand of Grant and Grey; He jests at Holland House; He dines extremely every day On ortolans and grouse: Our salads now he will not touch, He keeps a different set; They'll never love him half so much As those he must forget! He used to write the sweetest things, In all our Albums, once; But now his harp has lost the strings; His muse is quite a dunce. We read his speeches in the Times, And vast renown they get; But all those dear, delicious rhymes All hearts, but mine, forget. He flirts this year immensely ill; His flattery don't improve; When Weippert plays a gay quadrille, He sighs, “I rise to move;” And when I sing “The Soldier's Tear,” The song he called his “pet,” He comes and whispers “Hear, hear, hear! How can he so forget? I'm studying now, to please his taste, MacCulloch, Bentham, Mill; To win his smile, I'm making haste To understand the Bill; I read the stuff Reviewers write Of corn, and funds, and debt; Alas, that all I read at night With morning I forget! I wish he'd leave his friend, Lord Brougham, The realm's disease to cure; Wherever else, in him there's room For some reform, I'm sure! His borough is in Schedule A, And that's some comfort yet; 'Twill hardly give him time, they say— Poor fellow! to forget! XV. ODE ADDRESSED TO THE RT. HON. POULETT THOMSON, ON HIS DISCOVERY OF THE FRUCTIFYING PRINCIPLE. Poulett, our ancestors were fools; But we have lectures, pamphlets, schools, Lord Brougham and Gower Street College; All patriots learn to read and write; And bigots shudder at the light Of newspapers and knowledge. Immortal men our Earth have blest; Great Kitchiner invented yest, And made mysterious gravy; In jet is blazoned Warren's name; The safety lamp lights up the fame Of good Sir Humphrey Davy. But round thy temples, Thomson, played (Young Solon of the Board of Trade) A blaze of brighter glory; When thou didst make, with wondrous wit, A surplus of a deficit, To bother Whig and Tory. “Let not the creditor be grieved, Although his cash be not received;” Oh bliss to hear thee say it! “How can his interest be worse? 'Tis fructifying in the purse Of those who ought to pay it!” The gallery shook at that dark word; The chief clerk trembled as he heard; Up started Mr. Speaker: And thou didst smile on poor Lord A., A mild, meek smile, that seemed to say “Eureka! Lo, Eureka!” “Henceforth,” Long Wellesley Long Pole said, “Henceforth I shall not hear with dread The echoes of my knocker!” Quoth Joseph Hume, “I'll bet a pound The clever boy has somewhere found My own new notes on Cocker!” Harvey and Schonswar cried, “Hear, hear,” Only poor Waithman did not cheer; Ah, whence was Waithman's sorrow? “I wish,” he sighed, “that eight or nine Good liberal customers of mine Mayn't see the Times to-morrow!” Hail, happy Thomson! Fraud and debt Shall mock the Fleet and the Gazette, By grace of thine orations; Fierce Captain Rock, in Clare and Louth, Shall leave off oaths, and learn to mouth Thy limpid lucubrations. Prate on, prate on, oh! not in vain; So long as London shall contain A seller and a buyer— Perish Ricardo, perish Mill! Thy praise shall be recorded still, Poulett—the Fructifier! XVI. THE DREAM OF A REPORTER. “Dreams being, as plays are, the representation of things which do not really happen.”—Johnson's Dictionary. The speech was dull, the speech was long; Deep languor o'er my senses crept; I know it was extremely wrong, But there I nodded, yawned and slept. I slept. By Lethe's drowsy lake! I hold him not of woman born, Who can contrive to keep awake Through more than half an hour of Horne. I dreamed a dream. There came a change On day and night, on heaven and earth; Whate'er I saw was new and strange; All Nature had a second birth; Antiquity began to stare, Arithmetic was all aghast, For round was turning into square, And two and two were five, at last! Above, below, methought I saw More marvels than the Muse can name; A Denman with a little law; A Harvey with some sense of shame. Methought I heard Lord Althorp say A thing which Canning might have said, And found that Lord John Russell's play Was pretty generally read. Calley was sober; Hunt was dumb; Sir Henry Parnell had no plan; Sheil reasoned; Stanley was become A most good-natured gentleman; There were no robbers left in Greece; There were no papists left in Rome; And Clare and Kerry were at peace; So, also, was thy nose, Lord Brougham! I too was changed. I wrote a speech To prove my grandfather a slave; I taught what Scotch Reviewers teach; I raved as Bowring's pupils rave. At city feasts I learnt to bless The memory of immortal Cade, And “fructified” with great success, One morning, at the Board of Trade. I felt that Whiggism was divine; I bowed immensely low at Sheen; I praised Lord Holland's wit and wine; I wrote a libel on the Queen. I whispered that the Bishops want The schoolmaster's instructive rod, And vowed that it is monstrous cant To talk of Providence or God. Apt student in the Liberal school, I earned my patron's worthless pay; I took a cheque from Wellesley Pole, And worse, a title from Lord Grey. Alas, it was a dream of fear, A dream of guilt, a dream of pain; For all O'Connell bagged last year I would not dream that dream again! XVII. THE NEW LIGHT. BY AN ADMIRER OF JOSEPH HUME, ESQ., M.P. “Te sequar, O Graiæ gentis decus.”—Lucr. I must confess I like the plan Which Joseph Hume has taught, For saving to an honest man The toil and time of thought. I used to have a foolish way Of doing what was right; But now, I'm all for Brougham and Grey; I'll vote that black is white. That Russian Loan, in proper place, I own a sad faux pas; In spite of Palmerston's grimace, In spite of Denman's law. But why should either fret and fume, Smooth Lord or learned Knight? It's wasting words. I'll follow Hume, I'll vote that black is white. When Goulburn talks, to make a shine, Of income falling off, Sometimes I go away to dine, Sometimes I stay to cough. Let dear Lord Althorp fructify To Thomson's great delight; I'll keep my Cocker in my eye, I'll vote that black is white. The Whigs may move in Parliament That Jones has filled Gazettes, That Grecian scrip pays ten per cent., Or Wellesley Pole his debts; That all O'Connell says is true, That good is bad, day night; Move what they will, I'll help them through I'll vote that black is white. If Plenty leaves our land to-day, I'll say she comes in showers; If we fall down to Gallia's sway, I'll swear she bends to ours; If heavy taxes gall you, sir, I'll prove to you they're light; And if you blame the minister, I'll vote that black is white. I know that Joseph's full of fear, I'll vote that he is brave; I know his fame's not very clear, I'll vote he is no knave; I know that Joseph is a quack, I'll vote he's Solon, quite; In short, I know that black is black, I'll vote that black is white. XVIII. LONG AGO. To the Editor of the “Morning Post.” Sir,—The sentimental song of which I send you a copy has just been published by Mr. Chappell. The author of it has most impudently, and without any acknowledgment, adapted to his own purposes the words of an affectionate effusion which I poured forth some months ago upon occasion of the triumphant exaltation of one of my fellow-radicals to those honours and emoluments to which we all aspire. I beg you to insert the original stanzas, and to aid me in the exposure of the plagiary. My servile imitator may have the applause of the boarding-school, but justice will be done me at the Free-and-Easy. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, A Westminster Elector. “We were children together! Oh, brighter than mine,” etc. We were patriots together; Oh, placeman and peer Are the patrons who smile on your labours to-day; And Lords of the Treasury lustily cheer Whatever you do, and whatever you say. Go, pocket, my Hobhouse, as much as you will; The times are much altered, we very well know; But will you not, will you not, talk to us still, As you talked to us once, long ago, long ago? We were patriots together! I know you will think, Of the cobblers' caresses, the coal-heavers' cries, Of the stones that we threw, and the toasts that we drink, Of our pamphlets and pledges, our libels and lies! When Truth shall awake, and the country and town Be heartily weary of Althorp and Co., My Hobhouse, come back to the Anchor and Crown, Let us be what we were long ago—long ago! XIX. PLUS DE POLITIQUE. “Je n' en parlerai plus.”—de Béranger. No politics! I cannot bear To tell our ancient fame; No politics! I do not dare To paint our present shame. What we have been, what we must be, Let other minstrels say; It is too dark a theme for me: No politics to-day! I loved to see the captive's chain By British hands burst through; I loved to sing the fields of Spain, The war of Waterloo, But now the Russian's greedy swords Are edged with English pay; We help—we hire the robber hordes: No politics to-day! I used to look on many a home Of industry and art; I gazed on pleasure's gorgeous dome, On labour's busy mart: From Derby's rows, from Bristol's fires, I turn with tears away; I can't admire what Brougham admires: No politics to-day! I've often heard the faithless French Denounced by William Pitt; I've watched the flash, from this same bench, Of Canning's polished wit; And when your Woods and Waithmans brawl, Your Humes and Harveys bray— Good Lord! I'm weary of them all! No politics to-day! Let's talk of Coplestone and prayers, Of Kitchiner and pies, Of Lady Sophonisba's airs, Of Lady Susan's eyes; Let's talk of Mr. Attwood's cause, Of Mr. Pocock's play— Of fiddles—bubbles—rattles—straws! No politics to-day! XX. THE MAGIC BENCH. I have heard of a lamp, whose virtue makes Pearls of pebbles, and lawns of lakes; I have heard of a wand, whose mystic gold Turns lovely to loathsome, young to old; But there is a Bench, of power to change Far more rapid, and far more strange, Than ever was given to mortal hand By the mightiest charms of Fairyland. A dull lord breathed a bitter curse On the knaves that were robbing the public purse; For nobody now, he was bold to declare, In castle or cot, had a guinea to spare; And the debt and the taxes made him fear That the nation would all be starved next year. But he sits on the Bench, and people say He has flung five millions of money away. A Baronet came from the far far North, And he poured huge rivers of rhetoric forth, Prating of fetters, and prating of thrones, With serious looks, and solemn tones; And quoting bits of Latin lore To make the country members roar. But he sits on the Bench, and he's as dumb As an unstrung lute, or a broken drum. A little man with a hooked nose came; His voice was thunder, his glance was flame; He said he had seen, and he heaved a sigh, A hero flogged who was six feet high; And he thought it a horrid, heathenish plan, To punish the faults of so tall a man. But he sits on the Bench, and the drummers vow He carries a “cat” in his pocket now. I saw a wise Lord John, who took, Wherever he went, a learned book; It treated of Commons, it treated of Crown, Of building up, and of pulling down; All cried who could—or could not—read, The book was a charming book indeed. But he sits on the Bench, and it's quite absurd, He has eaten the volume every word. Many I see who, years ago, Were as white and fair as the new fallen snow; But they sit on the Bench, and lo! they're black As the plumage on the raven's back; And many whom we measured then, Were found to be enormous men; But they sit on the Bench, and it's pretty well known How very little they all are grown. Would'st thou go thither? Oh study well How thou may'st break the perilous spell! Heed not a threat, and hear not a gibe; Shun no labour, and touch no bribe: Let the bright dame Honour be Ever a guard and a guide to thee; Love not the traitors, and trust not the French; And so be safe on the Magic Bench! XXI. PLEDGES. BY A TEN-POUND HOUSEHOLDER. When a gentleman comes With his trumpets and drums, And hangs out a flag at the Dragon, Some pledges, no doubt, We must get him to spout To the shop-keepers, out of a wagon. For although an M.P. May be wiser than we Till the House is dissolved, in December, Thenceforth, we're assured, Since Reform is secured, We'll be wiser by far than our member. A pledge must be had That, since times are so bad, He'll prepare a long speech, to improve them; And since taxes, at best, Are a very poor jest, He'll take infinite pains to remove them. He must promise and vow That he'll never allow A Bishop to ride in his carriage; That he'll lighten our cares By abolishing prayers, And extinguishing baptism and marriage. He must solemnly say That he'll vote no more pay To the troops, in their ugly red jackets; And that none may complain On the banks of the Seine, He'll dismast all our ships, but the packets. That the labourer's arm May be stout on the farm, That our commerce may wake from stagnation, That our trades may revive, And our looms look alive, He'll be pledged to all free importation. And that city and plain May recover again From the squabbles of Pitts and of Foxes, He'll be pledged, amidst cheers, To demolish the Peers, And give us the balls and the boxes. Some questions our wit May have chanced to omit; So, for fear he should happen to stumble, He must promise to go With Hume, Harvey, and Co., And be their obedient and humble. We must bind him, poor man, To obey their divan, However their worships may task him, To swallow their lies Without any surprise, And to vote black is white, when they ask him. These hints I shall lay, In a forcible way, Before an intelligent quorum, Who meet to debate Upon matters of State, To-night, at the National Forum. XXII. HUME TRANSLATED. “Oh Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?” “Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! thou art translated.” Midsummer Night's Dream. The cunning man has scowled on me Who changes black to white; There never came wizard from over the sea More strong to blast and blight; He breathes his spell in a dark dark den, The Chancellor well knows where; His servants are devils, his wand is a pen, And his circle is Printing House Square. Many a strange and quaint disguise The crafty conjuror wears; Sometimes he mutters blasphemies, Sometimes he mumbles prayers; And if he rides to burn a town On a galloping Broom to-day, To-morrow he quakes from the sole to the crown Like a Friar of Orders Grey. I once was fair; not Waithman's face Was a fairer face than mine, Ere the sorcerer's eye had marred the grace Of the features so divine; On my brow a few black drops he threw, And a few fierce words he said, And lo—and lo—wherever I go I wear an ass's head! My hands were once extremely clean, I was an honest man; No purer patriot ever was seen In Freedom's glorious van. He has withered my arm with a fearful charm; It was wrought in Greece, they say; And folks look grave and call me a knave, In the public streets to-day. I used to cast accounts so fast That they called me Cocker's son; The Board of Trade was all aghast When I rose to carry one; But since that seal on my fate was set, I'm as dull as dull can be; I've quite forgot my tare and tret, And I've lost my Rule of Three. A mighty man that juggler is, So gloomy and so grim; You shall not find a task, I wis, Too difficult for him; He can make Lord Althorp half a wit, Lord Morpeth not a bore, And give Lord Palmerston hope to sit In the seat where he sat before. Would you retain for a twelvemonth's space The self-same hue and shape? Would you shun to change your natural face For the face of an owl or ape? Would you pray, through life's uncertain span. The fame you win to wear? Avoid, if you can, the cunning man, Whose circle is Printing House Square! XXIII. THE OLD SOLDIER. I saw to-day an ancient man, An ancient man and poor; And he was sitting with his can Before his cottage door. Right kindly he made room for me Upon the oaken bench, And “Here's Old England's health” quoth he, “And sorrow take the French!” “Good friend,” said I, “you're vastly wrong, Your wits are all awry; Mounseer, whom we abused so long, Is now our best ally.” He laughed outright in merry glee, And, winking to his wench, “Why, how his honour jests,” quoth he, “To say so of the French!” “In sooth it is a sober tale;” So I to him replied: “Together now our navies sail, Our troops charge side by side.” He stroked his head, which I might see Long years began to blench; “It's hard to swallow, Sir,” quoth he, “Such stories of the French.” “Nay, comrade, it were really best To let these errors sleep; French patties are superbly drest, French wine is very cheap.” He sipped his grog; could better be A soldier's thirst to quench? “Unwholesome is the mess,” quoth he, “Whene'er the cook is French!” “All this,” I cried, “is idle cant; To-day new lights advance; Lord Palmerston and Mr. Grant Can find no fault with France.” He knocked his pipe against his knee, The ashes made a stench; And, “Sir, there was a time,” quoth he, “They both disliked the French.” I gave it up: 'twas all in vain: The veteran had his way; He talked of Portugal and Spain, Of Marmont and of Ney; He talked of tempests on the sea, Of grape shot in the trench; “God bless the Duke!” so ended he; “How he did beat the French!” XXIV. A CABINET CAROL. “The statesman shews little practical wisdom, who obstinately adheres to his old opinions, when the circumstances which justified them exist no longer.”—Speech of Lord Palmerston. There was a time when I could sit By Londonderry's side, And laugh with Peel at Canning's wit, And hint to Hume he lied; Henceforth I run a different race, Another soil I plough, And though I still have pay and place, I'm not a Tory now. I've put away my ancient awe For mitre and for crown; I've lost my fancy for the law Which keeps sedition down; I think that patriots have a right To make a little row; A town on fire's a pretty sight: I'm not a Tory now. When Howick damns with bitter sneer The friends of that vile war, I whisper into Grant's dull ear “How just his strictures are!” When Burdett storms about expense, A smile comes o'er my brow: Sir Francis is a man of sense. I'm not a Tory now. I learn to be extremely shy With all my early cons; I'm very cold at Trinity, And colder at St. John's; But then, my Falmouth friends adore My smile, and tone, and bow; Don't tell them what I was before— I'm not a Tory, now! I'm always pleased with Jeffrey's prose, And charmed with Little's rhymes; I'm quite convinced the nation owes Its welfare to the Times. When people write the K? a fool, And call the Q? a frow, I'm philosophically cool; I'm not a Tory now. If Harvey gets Brougham's seals and seat, My friend will Harvey be; If Cobbett dines in Downing Street, He'll have my three times three; If Hunt in Windsor Castle rules, I'll take a house at Slough; Tories were always knaves and fools. I'm not a Tory, now! XXV. STANZAS. BY A TEN POUNDER OBJECTED TO. Sanctarum inscitia legum.—Hor. I'm quite amazed! Twelve months and more I've taken monstrous pains To raise my friends from shore to shore, And make them break their chains; And much I've plotted, much I've planned, With energy and skill, And yet I cannot understand The clauses of the Bill. The patriots in the papers wrote To say the fight was won; Yet some maintain I have a vote, And some aver I've none; And bless me! do whate'er I can, And ask where'er I will, I never find a gentleman Who comprehends the Bill. Attorney Fleece is very good At anything obscure; If nonsense can be understood, He'll understand it, sure; There's no man better at a lease, Or sharper at a will; But bless your heart! Attorney Fleece Is bothered by the Bill! At Greek or Latin, you may swear, The schoolmaster is quick; They say he'll construe, I declare, Right through a wall of brick; But he's been poring for a week, And may be poring still; It's infinitely worse than Greek— He can't translate the Bill. My landlord, old Sir Charles, was sent, In the most flattering way, From Hocus Hall to Parliament To help Reform, and Grey. He sat, Sir, for the nation's sake, Till sitting made him ill: And then—'twas easier to make, Than to make out—the Bill. At last, to set the matter right, Two counsellors came down; And each, to make our darkness light, Has brought a wig and gown. But one says “yes,” and t'other “no,” A—“black,” B—“white,” until I don't think either seems to know The meaning of the Bill. They say Lord Brougham has power to teach All sorts of puzzling things, From alphabets and parts of speech Down to the crimes of kings. If yet, in pamphlets and reviews, He loves young minds to drill, Some day, perhaps, he will diffuse Some knowledge of the Bill. XXVI. AN EPISTLE FROM AN OLD ELECTIONEERER TO A YOUNG SECRETARY. I've canvassed, dear Charles, since we parted, Our friends in this beautiful town; But really, I'm quite broken-hearted To find the good cause going down. Some pestilent, profligate Tory Has done all the mischief, no doubt; The voters are all in one story; They ask what the war is about. I tell them of Gatton and Sarum; I cut up the Bishops and Peers; I ring the old useful alarum Of negroes and whips in their ears; I point out the manifold mercies We've had since Sir Robert went out: They all put their hands on their purses And ask what the war is about. When they drink my success at my dinners, I speak in an eloquent strain; And then, sir, the weavers and spinners Cry “bravo!” and “bravo!” again; But just in the midst of the cheering Some brute at the bottom will shout— “We all of us want to be hearing What all this here war is about!” Some come with inquisitive faces, Some come with inquisitive tones; One grumbles—another grimaces— Here pamphlets are flying—there stones. If I go to a market or masquing, If I'm one at a row or a rout, Belles, butchers, all long to be asking— Ah me! what the war is about. The Aldermen pause in their feeding To babble of dam and of dyke; My Lady insists upon reading The lines in her book on Van Speyk Sir Andrew jumps up to abuse me, In spite of his years and his gout, And his little girl lisps, to amuse me, “Tell Ma what the war is about.” We'll carry poor Palmerston through, Charles, Whatever the country may say; But his Lordship, between me and you, Charles, Behaves in a very odd way; He's clever at jesting and joking, Which surely we might do without; But he won't—it's extremely provoking— Explain what the war is about! XXVII. THE BEGGAR'S THANKS. “He was grateful for the plan, though he admitted he desired much more.”—Speech of Mr. O'Connell, K.C. He mutters no threat, he points no gibe, He speaks in civil tone; It's truly puzzling to describe How loyal he is grown. He owes a debt—it's very sweet To have such debts to pay; He owes his thanks to Downing Street— He's grateful to Lord Grey. In yon green isle it is averred That treason has been hot; Some houses have been burnt, I heard, And some old parsons shot. But bless my heart! I'm quite prepared To hope a fairer day; The great O'Connell has declared He's grateful to Lord Grey! He always rises to protest If people prate of law; A statute is to him a jest, An oath a wisp of straw. Oh surely 'tis a charming plan, Whatever bigots say, Which makes so excellent a man So grateful to Lord Grey! Go on, my lords and gentlemen! Pull down what yet remains; Drive to the Holy Pontiff's pen His flock of Bourkes and Shanes; In honest men you'll hear and see Some anger, some dismay; But Daniel and his friends will be More grateful to Lord Grey. XXVIII. A NURSERY SONG. “I had forgot Waterloo.” —Joseph Hume. Hume has been dotting and carrying one, Hume has been helping O'Connell and son, Hume has been proving that wrong is right, Hume has been voting that black is white; Hume has so many things to do, Hume has forgotten Waterloo. Hume has been studying tare and tret, Hume has been summing the national debt, Hume has been babbling of silk and grain, Hume has been poring o'er Cocker and Paine, Hume is a sage and a patriot too— Hume has forgotten Waterloo. Hume has been jobbing with infinite skill, Hume has been treating the poor Greeks ill, Hume has been rivalling Bowring's crimes, Hume has been chid in the fierce old Times, Hume has been reading the Yellow and Blue— Hume has forgotten Waterloo. Hume for his toils has a wide wide scope; Hume is a friend to the friends of the Pope, Hume has a pleasure in Antwerp's fall, Hume has an eye on Greece and Gaul, Hume has a heart for a Quaker or Jew— Hume has forgotten Waterloo. Hume has been praising Bentham's schemes, Hume has been puffing Thomson's dreams, Hume has been hinting that piety's cant, Hume has been frightening good Charles Grant; Hume is to me what he is to you; Hume has forgotten Waterloo. XXIX. STANZAS ON SEEING THE SPEAKER ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR, DURING ONE OF THE DEBATES OF THE FIRST REFORMED PARLIAMENT. Sleep, Mr. Speaker; it's surely fair, If you don't in your bed, that you should in your chair; Longer and longer still they grow, Tory and Radical, Aye and No; Talking by night, and talking by day; Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sleep, sleep while you may! Sleep, Mr. Speaker; slumber lies Light and brief on a Speaker's eyes. Fielden or Finn, in a minute or two, Some disorderly thing will do; Riot will chase repose away; Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sleep, sleep while you may. Sleep, Mr. Speaker; Cobbett will soon Move to abolish the sun and moon; Hume, no doubt, will be taking the sense Of the House on a saving of thirteen pence; Grattan will growl, or Baldwin bray; Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sleep, sleep while you may. Sleep, Mr. Speaker; dream of the time When loyalty was not quite a crime, When Grant was a pupil in Canning's school, And Palmerston fancied Wood a fool. Lord, how principles pass away! Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sleep, sleep while you may. Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sweet to men Is the sleep that comes but now and then; Sweet to the sorrowful, sweet to the ill, Sweet to the children who work in a mill. You have more need of sleep than they; Sleep, Mr. Speaker; sleep, sleep while you may. XXX. PATRIOT AND PLACEMAN. A NEW SONG, INSCRIBED TO THE ELECTORS OF WESTMINSTER. Sir John was a patriot, who talked to the town In a very fine style at the Anchor and Crown; Sir John was a placeman, who went to entrench His wisdom and wit on the Treasury Bench. Derry Down. Sir John was a patriot, all stutter and storm, Who promised the people a ton of Reform! Sir John was a placeman, who thought it would do To give the poor people a bushel or two. Derry Down. Sir John was a patriot, whose scorn was immense For the vermin who plundered the poor of their pence; Sir John was a placeman, who whispered a wish To honest Lord Grey for a loaf and a fish. Derry Down. Sir John was a patriot, who used to exclaim That flogging tall men was a horrible shame; Sir John was a placeman, who handled a whip, And softly requested the privates to strip. Derry Down. Sir John was a patriot, who swooned when he saw A soldier called out in support of the law; Sir John was a placeman, who sent, I declare, The Colonels and Captains to Cork and to Clare. Derry Down. Sir John was a patriot, who valiantly swore My windows and house should pay taxes no more; Sir John was a placeman, who fled like a mouse, When Althorp was taxing my window and house. Derry Down. Sir John was a patriot, who happened one day To creep from his seat and his office away; Sir John was a placeman, who laboured in vain To creep to his seat and his office again! Derry Down. XXXI. WHISTLE. INTENDED TO BE SUNG BY SIR JOHN CAM HOBHOUSE, AFTER HIS RE-ELECTION FOR WESTMINSTER. Oh whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Whatever you do, and whatever you say, Oh whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey! I promise, of course, what I promised before; I speak as I spoke, and I swear as I swore; But honest Lord Althorp to-morrow shall see, A promise is pie-crust to Burdett and me. So whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Whate'er be the pledges I swallow to-day, Just whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey. Perhaps I must talk, as I've talked long enough, Of taxes, and ballot, and flogging, and stuff; But Joseph, and Grote, and wise Alderman Key, You know, will have little assistance from me. So whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; I'm a popular man, and I talk for display, But whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey. It's a terrible bore when the Radicals bring Addresses, Petitions, and that sort of thing; But a shake of the head, and a bend of the knee, Is all they will get, if they bring them to me. Then whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Just wait till I've sent Mr. Wakley away, Then whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey. Though vanished and lost are the praises you won, Though I see you abused in the Times and the Sun, Though they laugh, my dear lord, at your Family Tree, These things are of little importance to me. So whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; Whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey; As long as you've places, as long as you've pay, Oh whistle, and I'll come to you, Lord Grey! XXXII. THE ADIEUS OF WESTMINSTER. When first you came courting, John Cam, John Cam, When first you came courting, John Cam, You came with Old Glory, Who hated a Tory As much as a Hebrew hates ham, ham, As much as a Hebrew hates ham. Oh, then you were charming, John Cam, John Cam, Oh, then you were charming, John Cam; As noisy and merry As Charley and Sherry, And almost as wise as Sir Sam, Sam, And almost as wise as Sir Sam. Fine presents you brought me, John Cam, John Cam, Fine presents you brought me, John Cam; A score of good reasons For tumults and treasons, Imported de chez Nôtre Dame, Dame, Imported de chez Nôtre Dame. You prated and plotted, John Cam, John Cam, You prated and plotted, John Cam; And at clubs played the knave, Till Rogers looked grave, And gave you the title of Pam, Pam, And gave you the title of Pam. How oft on my hustings, John Cam, John Cam, How oft on my hustings, John Cam, You preached Revolution With grand elocution, Which maddened me just like a dram, dram, Which maddened me just like a dram. And that was your triumph, John Cam, John Cam, And that was your triumph, John Cam; When I kicked up a row, You made a low bow, Which in Turkey they call a salaam,—laam, Which in Turkey they call a salaam. You smiled approbation, John Cam, John Cam, You smiled approbation, John Cam, When I cudgelled their backs well Who voted for Maxwell, And flung filthy turnips at Lamb, Lamb, And flung filthy turnips at Lamb. And great were your praises, John Cam, John Cam, And great were your praises, John Cam; And the trumpet of fame Blew Hobhouse's name As far as Seringapatam,—tam, As far as Seringapatam. Ah! why did you ever, John Cam, John Cam, Ah! why did you ever, John Cam, Get into disgrace, By taking a place, And proving your principles sham, sham, And proving your principles sham? Go back to your cronies, John Cam, John Cam, Go back to your cronies, John Cam; To Althorp, so funny In matters of money, And Thomson, who tattles of tram, tram, And Thomson, who tattles of tram. To Grant, the religious, John Cam, John Cam, To Grant, the religious, John Cam, Whose soul it annoys, That the little black boys Should work for their cocoa and yam, yam, Should work for their cocoa and yam; To Russell the rhymer, John Cam, John Cam, To Russell the rhymer, John Cam; To Graham, who stutters Of frigates and cutters, And Campbell the Prince of Qui Tam, Tam, And Campbell the Prince of Qui Tam. We're parted for ever, John Cam, John Cam, We're parted for ever, John Cam; You can't think—oh heavens! With tall Colonel Evans— You can't think how happy I am, am, You can't think how happy I am! XXXIII. THIRTY-TWO AND THIRTY-THREE. “Nous avons changé tout cela.”—Molière. I often think it's very strange That people are so very slow In finding out how all things change Which mortals think, or feel, or know. What fools have done, they still will do; What fools have been, they still will be; As if the world of thirty-two Had been the world of thirty-three. When wise Lord Milton fiercely screamed “No taxes till the Bill is law,” To all the Whigs Lord Milton seemed The noblest lord they ever saw: At Michaelmas, if I and you Should plead, my friends, Lord Milton's plea, As he was puffed in thirty-two We sha'n't be puffed in thirty-three. Where patriots met a year ago To wave their hats, and strain their throats, Lord Althorp took his pen, you know, And wrote them vastly civil notes; But bless us, if a chosen few Are found admiring Lee and Mee, They feel the thanks of thirty-two Are turned to thumps in thirty-three. Of old, when long petitions came From Tom and Dick, who brew and bake, We used to hear the Press proclaim That all the nation was awake. If Dick and Tom, who bake and brew, To-day petition to be free, “The nation” roared in thirty-two, It's just “the mob” in thirty-three. Our Pyms and Hampdens made their bow To millions, or to myriads, then; But Lord! they only babble now To half-a-score of drunken men. Then, nothing into numbers grew; Now, numbers into nothing flee; For one was ten in thirty-two, And ten are one in thirty-three. What fairy with her liquid song— What sorcerer with his mystic spell Turns wrong to right, and right to wrong, And Hell to Heaven, and Heaven to Hell? Brougham says—and what Brougham says, is true— “Don't marvel at the things you see; For we were Whigs in thirty-two, And we are Whigs in thirty-three!” XXXIV. THE WASHING OF THE BLACKAMOOR. “Vivant qui nigra in candida vertunt.”—Juv. There was a little man, And he had a little plan To set the West Indies all right, O; And quoth he, “The House I'll teach In a pretty little speech, How to wash the Blackamoor white, O.” There was a House wherein Were Fielden, Faithfull, Finn, And they listened with infinite delight, O, When in Biblical quotation He breathed his expectation Of washing the Blackamoor white, O. There was a grave philosopher Who vowed the plan to toss over, Which seemed all his visions to blight, O; Fowell Buxton was his name, And he muttered “Fie for shame! This won't wash the Blackamoor white, O.” There was Lushington, the Doctor, That very learned Proctor Who in speaking spits fire and spite, O; He at this was discontented, And to nothing less assented Than washing the Blackamoor white, O. There was a youthful Tully, Determined not to sully His laurels so green and so bright, O; And he sighed, “With heartfelt sorrow I must leave my place to-morrow, If you won't wash the Blackamoor white, O.” There was a lord, sad-hearted Since from office he departed, And he rose in a melancholy plight, O, To say that he had rather Go himself and teach his father How to wash the Blackamoor white, O. There was a band which marched, Four hundred, stiff and starched, To Downing Street, to fight the good fight, O; Saints, sinners, all came forth, From the south and from the north, All to wash the Blackamoor white, O. There was a private room Where they laboured to illume Dark councils with sparks of new light, O; And stunned the Administration With excommunication, If it wouldn't wash the Blackamoor white, O. There was a mortgage deed, As fair a thing to read As ever a lawyer could write, O; But the parchment, people say, Lighted fires for Brougham and Grey, While they washed the Blackamoor white, O. There was a merchant ship Returning from a trip, And her owner was sad at the sight, O; Despairing of Barbadoes, For rum and muscovadoes, After washing the Blackamoor white, O. There was a hungry nation, Which heard with much vexation That her ministers meant, if they might, O, To tack to that long debt of hers The price of Stanley's metaphors, And of washing the Blackamoor white, O. XXXV. MR. LITTLETON'S FRIENDSHIP. “He proceeded to explain the motives which had led him most reluctantly to accept office; it was solely on public grounds, and to relieve the Ministry from the embarrassment in which they were then placed.” Report of Mr. Littleton's Speech. Oh yes, the gentleman has place, The gentleman has pay; His worth has found its proper grace With Althorp, Brougham, and Grey; But don't suspect the patriot cares For any private ends; For—hear him—hear him—he declares It's all to serve his friends. Pert Kennedy looks wondrous blue; Spring Rice detests a mob; There's nobody disposed to do This pretty Irish job: O'er all the Whigs in Downing Street, A sudden fate impends; Our member has a nice snug seat, Why mayn't he serve his friends? Alas, it is a weary toil To find a proper man To break a lance with Doctor Doyle, To change a cuff with Dan! A luckless life the man will lead Whom Grey to Dublin sends! He would refuse—he would indeed— Except to serve his friends. You see, in country and in town— I own it, if I must— They're tearing Althorp's picture down, And breaking Russell's bust; When far and near there's hardly one Who likes them or defends, How kind of Mr. Littleton To go and serve his friends! We want the good to come to pass They promised us last year; We want to see through cheaper glass, To swallow cheaper beer. But never mind, our idle whim Our member's taste offends; What are our little wants to him? He wants to serve his friends. Some day, no doubt, they'll pay the debt Which they're incurring now; Some day he'll wear a coronet Upon his lordly brow; Though Radicals and Tories sneer, The country comprehends That whenso'er he's made a Peer, 'Twill be—to serve his friends. XXXVI. THE REMONSTRANCE. “He added, in agitated but emphatic tones, ‘Mr. Attwood, I have not deserved this from you!’”—See Mr. Attwood's account of the Skirmish at Gateshead. Mr. Attwood—we're going to dinner; Mr. Attwood—the time, and the place! Mr. Attwood—as I am a sinner, The thing is too long for a grace. Ten columns! it's out of the question; Go out, Mr. Attwood, pray do; You'll ruin his lordship's digestion! He has not deserved it of you! The voice of the people, Heaven bless it, Is sweet to us all, as you know; But, really sometimes, we confess it, It's terribly mal-à-propos: To-morrow, no doubt, he'll be able To talk with you, many or few; But just when the turtle's on table— He has not deserved it of you. You see there are gentlemen present Who have come to our party from far; Consider—it's vastly unpleasant— Consider how hungry they are! From Newport and Hull they have posted, With speeches, and appetites too; They came to be toasted, not roasted— He has not deserved it of you! Last year, when your orators spouted, They spouted in rapture his fame; Last year, when your multitudes shouted, They shouted in riot his name; Last year you came up with caresses; Last year you were licking his shoe; Away with your ill-bred addresses! He has not deserved it of you! And surely you'll listen to reason! Who is it you come to put down? The noblest of traders in treason, The first of the foes of the Crown; The pilot who sits in the steerage With Faithfulls and Finns for his crew; His lordship—the Hunt of the Peerage— He has not deserved it of you! Oh never! Lord Durham has others To censure, to scorn, to condemn; But you, his dear friends and sworn brothers, Should never take service with them. The good may despise and detest him, The honest, the loyal, the true; But why should the traitors molest him? He has not deserved it of you! XXXVII. THE RUSSELL MELODIES. NO. I. OH SNATCHED AWAY IN THY FIRST QUARTER. Note by Lord John Russell.—I am indebted for the idea of these stanzas to one of the Hebrew Melodies. I mention it that the reader may see my melody is as much superior to Byron's, as my play was to Schiller's. “Oh snatched away in Beauty's bloom,” etc. “We have often been reproached for the unkindness of our allusions to Lord John Russell's poetical works. We confess we do think Don Carlos the worst tragedy extant, and we never found anybody of a different opinion, except one sallow gentleman who writes in the Edinburgh Review, and visits occasionally at Holland House. But we readily admit that many of his lordship's unpublished jeux d'esprit and vers de société possess merit; and we are willing to make amends to the noble lord by presenting a few of them to the public. The affectionate pathos of the following stanzas, which were addressed to the late member for Westminster, on his retiring from place and parliament, has made them very popular in fashionable circles.” Oh snatched away in thy first quarter, Note by Mr. Joseph Hume.—Sir John appears to have held the Irish Secretaryship for thirty-three days. The salary of the office being £5,500 per annum, the baronet will be found to have earned £197 5s. 4½d —errors excepted. We have for thee nor star nor garter; But Grey and Brougham make jests about Thy taking in and turning out, And call thee, in the Cabinet, their Martyr. And in the Borough, where our game Note by Lord Althorp.—This is a mistake. In many parts of the country, I must candidly confess, the late Act rendered game scarce. But in Westminster I may venture to assure my noble friend it can have done little harm, because, in point of fact, for many years there has been in Westminster no game at all. But His Majesty's Government will not oppose the appointment of a committee to inquire into the subject. Note by Sir Francis Burdett.—It is no mistake at all. Is all at sixes and at sevens, De Vear, deep fellow, sings thy fame, Note by dear De Vear.—I never sing. And swears he'll move the earth, the heavens! Note by ditto.—I never swear. As if there were a chance with Colonel Evans! Away! We know we've lost our Hobby; We know close seats exist no longer; Note by the Duke of Bedford and Earl Fitz William.—Pooh! Will this console us in the lobby, Or make Wood's list one vote the stronger? And thou—who laughest at my vapours— Thyself art packing up thy papers! Note by Earl Durham.—This apostrophe is addressed to me. The papers alluded to are the rough drafts of the Clauses of the Reform Bill, the preparation of which was entrusted to me by my noble father-in-law. Note by Mr. Joseph Hume.—I suspect that Lord Durham's share in the Reform Bill will turn out a monte mus. XXXVIII. THE RUSSELL MELODIES. NO. II. ODE ON THE PASSING OF THE REFORM BILL. Note by Lord John Russell.—As in my Don Carlos I imitated Schiller, and in my Reform Bill took a leaf from the Abbé Sièyes, I have, in the following stanzas, appropriated many ideas, without hesitation, from one of the Odes of old Horace. The Roman poet has been accused of vanity in the application of extravagant panegyric to his own works. If such an imputation is cast upon me, I answer briefly that, except by a poetical licence, I am not the author of the Reform Bill; it was framed by Lord Durham; Sir James Graham and Lord Duncannon were consulted by him on some important points. For my own part, I gave him advice upon nothing, except a trifling matter connected with the well-doing of the borough of Tavistock. I may venture to subjoin Horace's Ode, since, under the Reform Act, all country gentlemen understand Latin:— “Exegi monumentum ære perennius,” etc. “We are happy to learn that our commencement of this series of papers has delighted, in no ordinary degree, the friends of the noble poet, to whose effusions we thus give a circulation which his own amiable diffidence would have denied them. “Oh snatched away,” has already been set to music by a distinguished amateur composer; and a certain secretary of State, residing not twenty miles from Carlton Gardens, has been heard to say that the Russell Melodies deserve a second reading much better than the Russell Bills. Encouraged by these circumstances, we present to our readers a second selection from the MSS. entrusted to us, a selection made, of course, in compliment to the not unnatural preference of the illustrious author, since it cannot be expected that we should sympathize in the exultation he expresses upon the event which is his theme.” 'Tis done! I have finished my monument now; What tidings of transport for Sutton and Bernal! Take the brass—all the brass—of the chancellor's brow, You won't build a monument half so eternal. 'Tis as tall as a pyramid—wonderful edifice— Though it threatens the stars—(see the book of Belzoni); 'Tis as tall as Lord Grey, though that classical head of his Brushes down a nice star, now and then, for a crony. Note by ? Esq.—I was in the Fifth Form at Eton with the First Lord of Treasury. I remember his making a pun about an often-quoted line—Stellæ sponte sua jussæne vagentur et errent.—“The question don't admit of discussion,” said he; “the Stars would be good for nothing without the Orders!” It shall last, for the weal and the strength of the nation, Unharmed by the changes of destiny's weather; No flight of the times shall impair its foundation, Note by a poor Author.—Horace did not live in the days of newspaper criticism, or he would not have been so bold as Lord John. A flight of the Times is a very serious thing. While Hume and the tides go on moving together. And me, its wise author, the world shall remember, As long as a talkative mayor shall preside At Guildhall, o'er the turtle and toasts, in November, With a mute Lady Mayoress perched by his side. Of me they shall say on the banks of the Tweed, Of me they shall say on the banks of the Shannon, “Lord John, whom we used to think little indeed, But who grew a great man by the help of Dun cannon, Note by Lord Duncannon.—England will understand, sooner or later, how much she owes me. Ostensibly, indeed, I am content to be, like the chaste Diana, Silvarum potens, First Commissioner of Woods and Forests; but I am more than meets the eye; “no waiter, but a Knight Templar;” a Legislator in disguise—a Lycurgus under a domino. Lord Durham can explain this. “To his praise be it told, was the first to bring over A new and original French Constitution, Importing the treasure from Calais to Dover On board of His Majesty's ship Revolution.” Oh crown me, Melpomene, nymph of sad numbers! Note by the Quarterly Reviewer of Miss Burney's Memoirs.—We have found in the Registry of the Parish of Parnassus, that this “nymph,” the daughter of Thespis and Mnemosyne, was baptized b.c. 539; so that she was two thousand three hundred and seventy-two years old when this Ode was composed. Though over my play, if you ever begin it, You slumber as sound as the President slumbers Note by one of the Commissioners of the Board of Control.—The Rt. Hon. Charles Grant is a psychological curiosity. He is the drowsiest philosopher of his own or of any day. He writes in his sleep, reads in his sleep, eats in his sleep, drinks in his sleep. He sleeps at the Board, he sleeps in the house, he sleeps at Court, and he sleeps in the Cabinet. He sleeps while you talk to him, and he sleeps while he talks to you. He is the seven sages and the seven sleepers in his own proper person. At the Board of Control, o'er an eloquent minute, Yet crown me with laurel; to-night at Old Drury You may look at a case like my own, if you will; The play is but so-so; yet let me assure ye, You'll find some magnificent things in the Bill! XXXIX. THE RUSSELL MELODIES. NO. III. FLY NOT YET. “We do not know by what negligence on our part it has happened that this interesting series has been so long discontinued. We were reminded of our error on Saturday by the circulation of the little effusion which we present to our readers to-day. It has been composed by the noble author on occasion of the expressed disposition of Lord Grey to escape from the fatigues of office; and we are assured that the strong pathes with which it has been sung to the noble Lord by the various members of his family who are qualified to take part in it, has produced a wonderfully tranquillizing effect upon the Premier's mind. We do not flatter the author of Don Carlos too much, when we express our conviction that the present stay of Earl Grey in office is attributable not more to the favour of his Sovereign, or the cordiality of his colleagues, than to the seductive harmony of the Russell Melodies, No. III. “We omit the variorum notes. The little poem is sufficiently intelligible without them, and their insertion would trench too much upon our space. Selection is an invidious task; if we take one note, we are forced to take as many as are brought to us. The Chancellor of the Exchequer denies this; but we think him wrong.” Fly not yet! We're all agreed That office, like a noxious weed Which nicer taste rejects, disdains, Grows sweeter for its stings and stains To Goderich, Grant and Co. 'Twas but that we might hold it fast, The Bill, the glorious Bill, was passed, For whose fourscore immortal clauses The people gave three penny vases; Oh stay! oh stay! Whigs so often vainly long For pay and place, that oh, 'twere wrong So soon to let them go. Fly not yet! The thief that stood Of yore beneath the fatal wood Now tried the rope, now paced the cart, But seemed unwilling to depart When the doomed hour was near; And thus a Whig, much cuffed about, Will often talk of “going out;” Will hint he's done—will vow he'll do it, But will not, till they drive him to it. Oh stay! oh stay! When did Premier ere bring in So many of his kith and kin, To serve their country here? XL. THE RUSSELL MELODIES. NO. IV. ODE TO A NOBLE LORD. “In the Ode which we select for the fourth number of the Russell Melodies, the noble author imitates the spirited remonstrance addressed by Horace to the Roman coquette Barine. Horace complains that the adoration which is still offered to the false flirt, in spite of her repeated perfidies and perjuries, makes him doubt the existence of a retributive Providence. We think the noble author, in many recent examples of popular profligacy, has good grounds for questioning the existence of any sense of justice or feeling of decency, in the minds of those by whom praise or blame is in our times awarded to political character. “Lord Palmerston is utterly unable to inform us to what noble lord his friend's stanzas are addressed.” If you, my dear lord, had been ever the worse For the profligate things you have done; If the title you bear were a scoff and a curse To the scribes of the Times and the Sun, Perhaps I might learn, in your sorrow and shame, Whate'er the Rotunda might say, To fancy consistency more than a name, And truth a good thing in its way. But you—when you've babbled your jests and your gibes At all that you've lived by for years, When you've shuddered at sinecures, shivered at bribes, And shaken your head at the Peers, Go back to your seat amid shouts of applause In every possible tone, And your principles seem to the friends of our cause As pure, I suspect, as my own. It's a glory for you to be racking your brains In showing to Pease and to Pryme That Englishmen used to wear infamous chains In Pitt's and in Percival's time; In proving of taxes and proving of trade Whatever you used to deny, And sneering at blunders by Castlereagh made Since he cannot get up to reply. Bright Venus, you know, my lord, laughs from above At the sad things her votaries do; And surely, the falsehoods we pardon in love May be pardoned in politics too; For the ribbands—the garters love maddens to touch, Ambition as gracefully kneels, And lovers don't long for their letters so much As ministers long for their seals! Hail, light of the House! The new Parliament men Support you in all you have done; The old, though they meant to be going at ten, Say “Aye” to your motion at one; The well-studied trope, which with Calvert succeeds, As surely with Codrington thrives, And the “Hear” is as loud from your Marshall of Leeds, As it is from your Halse of St. Ives. When you say “Mr. Speaker,” and stand on the floor, And wave your rhetorical wrist, Poor Ross in despair hurries down to the door, And mournfully looks at his list; At the sound of your voice, at the beam of your smile, The Big Beggarman is aghast; Such wisdom, such wit, he's afraid, will beguile His Maurice and Morgan at last. XLI. THE RUSSELL MELODIES. NO. V. “The Bill was not intended to destroy the legitimate influence of property.”—Speeches of Lord John Russell (passim). Sir John to Dudley is gone away With a confident tone, and a visage gay; Sir John from Dudley is coming back, With an altered tone, and a visage black; The dolts at Dudley are very dense, And deaf to “legitimate influence.” How shall we manage their fault to mend? The Earl Fitzwilliam is my friend; Though Wetherell scold, though Croker scoff, We'll send the knight in his chariot off; At Malton none are known to fence Against “legitimate influence.” If Earl Fitzwilliam will not smile, I have a colleague, Lord Carlisle; He knows, I fancy, a thing or two Of what the folk at Morpeth do; They have a horror of pounds and pence, But a taste for “legitimate influence.” If Lord Carlisle will not be won, I am his Grace of Bedford's son; Our own ten-pounders in the West Will be happy to see their learned guest; Tavistock men are men of sense; They love “legitimate influence.” For true Reformers there will be In Downing Street a jubilee, When the champion proud of Freedom's cause Shall come to manufacture laws, Chosen—no matter how or whence— M.P. for “legitimate influence.” XLII. THE RUSSELL MELODIES. NO. VI. “The poem we present to our readers to-day, is one in which the noble author invites the First Lord of the Treasury to dinner, in a loose imitation of Horace's pretty Ode, ‘Œli, vetusto nobilis ab Lamo.’ “We have formerly illustrated his lordship's adaptations from the classics by quotations from the originals. Some of our fair readers have been angry with us for this; but their frowns would scarcely have moved us to substitute the clumsy English of Francis for the exquisite Latin of Horace, if a more reverend adviser had not supported their petition. The Bishop of Chichester assures us ‘he cannot be comfortable without a translation.’” Illustrious Premier! noble Peer, From Lamus,” ... Whose family will live in story, “From whom the illustrious race arose,” etc. While yon Red Book from year to year Immortalizes Whig and Tory, (Since in that wondrous book to-day We scarcely read of any others, As touching power, or tasting pay, But Earl Grey's sons, and Earl Grey's brothers), Next spring—if any part is true Croak not her boding note in vain.” Of what that arch wag, Brougham, is croaking In his dark Court, of me and you, With malice that is quite provoking— Next spring we must, alas! give o'er Our pretty plans, our pleasant places; And hide, upon Life's weedy shore, ..... with weeds the shore.” Our most uncomfortable faces. Let us be merry, ere our sin By such rebuke is overtaken; Bring Wood “Then pile the wood while yet you may.”—to tell us, with a grin, How vastly well we've saved our bacon; “Feast upon the fatted swine.” The Grants shall join us, half alive; “Give to your slaves one idle day” Tired Melbourne shall tie up his knocker; And dear dim Althorp shall contrive To steal one afternoon from Cocker. XLIII. MAXIMS. “Lord Auckland is understood to be appointed permanently on constitutional grounds.”—Globe, January 14th. If a Tory is ever found out In pocketing twenty pence, The thing is a job, no doubt; It admits of no defence: If a Whig has the luck to secure Some twenty thousand pounds, It is all arranged, be sure, On “Constitutional grounds.” If a Tory dares distrust The faith of our fiercest foe, Suspicion is quite unjust, And jealousy vastly low: If a Whig with a bold blockade Our ancient friend confounds, It is done for the good of trade, On “Constitutional grounds.” If a Tory punishes crimes In Kerry or in Clare, The wisdom of the Times Proclaims it quite unfair: If a Whig with a troop of horse The Murphys and Macs astounds, He cuts and thrusts, of course, On “Constitutional grounds.” If a Tory gives a place To a nephew, or a son, Good lack! a thing so base Was never, never done! If a Whig with his countless kin The nation's purse surrounds, They slip their fingers in On “Constitutional grounds.” Then take, my lord, oh take The gift the Greys provide, For the Constitution's sake, And for no end beside; And think, on quarter-day, Of the friend who thus expounds The rights of place and pay, On “Constitutional grounds.” XLIV. THE SONG OF THE NURSE. EXTRACTED FROM THE FORTHCOMING EDITION OF “GAMMER GURTON'S GARLAND.” Hush, my baby! if you don't, I shall find a way to treat you: Hush, my baby! if you won't, Gaffer Grey shall come and eat you! Lullaby! do not cry! Gaffer Grey is coming by! Gaffer Grey has jaws, they say, Like a ramping roaring lion; Masticating every day Whatsoe'er he casts his eye on. Lullaby! etc. Greedily he swallows up All his friends can buy or borrow; Bolts to-day a little cup, Gulps a long address to-morrow. Lullaby! etc. Oh the dainties he has got In his terrible refectory! Here a colonelcy, all hot, There a nicely roasted rectory. Lullaby! etc. Though its perfume, he protests, Is of sulphur and of nitre, He discusses and digests Now and then, a Bishop's mitre. Lullaby! etc. Whensoe'er he wags his lip Just to chat, or just to chatter, Down a score of trifles slip, No man caring for the matter. Lullaby! etc. Clerkships, lordships, there they are; Half a hundred every quarter; Now a ribbon, now a star, Here a cross, and there a garter. Lullaby! etc. Pages at the palace say They have seen him—sad disaster! Nibbling all the gems away From the sceptre of his master. Lullaby! etc. When good people stop and stare, Saying to themselves, “Good gracious! Did we e'er—oh no, we ne'er Saw a creature so voracious!” (Lullaby! etc.) Mid the murmurs of the town, On the Times the monster gazes; And, to wash his supper down, Swallows half a pipe of praises. Lullaby! etc. Hush, my baby! if you don't, I shall find a way to treat you: Hush, my baby! if you won't, Gaffer Grey shall come and eat you! Lullaby! do not cry! Gaffer Grey is coming by! XLV. THE STATE OF THE NATION. “We are now a trampled nation.”—Times. We have been some years reforming, Chattering, cheering, stamping, storming; Cutting bludgeons from the hedges, Asking for all sorts of pledges; Breaking heads, and breaking glasses, Calling people knaves and asses; After all our agitation, We are now a “trampled nation”! Mr. Croker's thrusts are parried, Schedules A and B are carried; Vain is Wetherell's long alarum, There is no reprieve for Sarum; All the money in our pockets Went to purchase squibs and rockets; Oh, what foolish exultation! We are still “a trampled nation”! Buckingham is quite a Tully, Solon was a fool to Gully; Pryme's a lecturer, caught at college, Pease, a Quaker, full of knowledge; Fielden is extremely clever, Finn can talk, and talk for ever: What a glorious constellation! Yet we are “a trampled nation.” We have got Lord Grey to ease us Of the taxes that displease us; We have got, besides, some dozens Of his lordship's sons and cousins: They are blest with places, pensions, And the very best intentions; It's against their inclination That we are “a trampled nation.” We have got the Times adorning Facts with figures every morning; Now denouncing right and reason, Now defending guilt and treason; Raving, ranting, blustering, blundering, Pro and con alternate thundering; It has wondrous circulation; Why are we “a trampled nation”? XLVI. A MEMBER'S MUSINGS. “Lord Althorp made a reply, but, as is almost invariably the case, the noble lord was perfectly inaudible in the gallery.” “The reply of the noble lord was again perfectly inaudible to any one in the gallery” —House of Commons Report, Tuesday, March 11th. “Order, order!”—“Bar, bar!”—“Door, door!” Such are the cries as he stands on the floor, Waving his hand for a little while, And wreathing his lip in a gentle smile: We stoop our head, we strain our ear; Nobody hears him;—“Hear, hear, hear!” What is he talking of?—figures or facts? Liberal principles?—Algerine acts? The rise of the unions, or of stocks? The weight of the debt, or the last prize ox? Crops or cholera?—Jews or beer? All of them!—none of them!—“Hear, hear, hear!” Quick is O'Connell in debate; Cunning is Hume to calculate; But Hume and O'Connell their way will miss, Trying to answer a speech like this! “When it's a proper time to cheer, Wake me, dear Ellice!”—“Hear, hear, hear!” There is a lady in a play, Who speaks, though she does nothing say; Fortune has brought us a lord in her freaks, Who just says nothing, though he speaks. What in the papers will appear? Only “Lord Althorp,” and “Hear, hear, hear!” XLVII. COUNSELS OF A FATHER TO HIS SON. “Down, Derry Down!'—Old Song. When I at last shall sleep in peace, When life's consumption shall be o'er, When I shall fill that payless place Where none shall plot or plunder more Remember on what wings I soared To infamy's unfading crown, How I became a noble lord, And you became the Dean of Down. Professing disregard of self, I won the ermine of a Peer; Avowing carelessness of pelf, I earned some thousand pounds a year; I caught the favours of the Court, And seemed as honest as a clown; And though I fathered a “Report,” I fathered, too, the Dean of Down. By turns with every party leagued, As each by turns might rise or fall, I blustered, bullied, schemed, intrigued, Was loved by none, was used by all; Placeman and patriot, both for pay, I flinched not from the general frown— I am the Chancellor to-day, And you to-day the Dean of Down. If I on this world's busy stage Had worshipped honour, followed truth, Less praise would gild my hoary age, Less hope would greet your sanguine youth. If blameless I my gown had worn, I still might wear my plain stuff gown; If I had shrunk from public scorn, You would not be the Dean of Down. Go forth and do as I have done, Like glory on your pathway shine; Mine be your principles, my son, And be your profits more than mine; Haste, worthy of your sire's embrace, To emulate your sire's renown; Be false and factious, bold and base, And make your son the Dean of Down! XLVIII. THE WHISPERS OF THE RUE RIVOLI. “He points to Lord Durham in the salons, and whispers, ‘That is the man!’”—Morning Post. Who will come to the place some day— The pleasant place, where dear Lord Grey Just now so tenderly feeds some dozens Of patriot sons and patriot cousins? Who from the national purse will draw All that is left by his father-in-law? Who will end what Grey began? That is the man! That is the man! Who in due time will make of me, Though in the city I may be “Very discreditably known,” Because of my share in a certain loan, Who in due time will make me yet A member of the Cabinet, Ruling with him his dark divan? That is the man! That is the man! Who, though I ought with Hume and Co. To have shrunk into privacy long ago, Will bring me the book, over whose long leaves Honest Lord Althorp growls and grieves, The ledger of the bankrupt state, That I may carefully calculate And glean from the ruin all I can? That is the man! That is the man! Who will saunter to Court, and sing A pretty song to our Lord the King, Of peers in treason foul arrayed, Of wicked plots by bishops laid, Of loyalty spouting from Radical Clubs, Of piety driven to preach from tubs? Who will Royalty's wits trepan? That is the man! That is the man! Who by and by, when a maiden Queen Shall on our tottering throne be seen, All too weak to stem the storm Which we philosophers call “Reform”— Who will condescend to hold Robe of state and sceptre of gold, Leaving her Majesty frock and fan? That is the man! That is the man! Who will abolish the mitre and crown, And pull the Church and the Palace down? Who will burn, at the public charge, The Bible and Prayer-book and statutes at large? Who will annul and annihilate quite All the old maxims of wrong and right, And govern the world on a nice new plan? That is the man! That is the man! XLIX. THE FALSE REPORT. “We must condole with the Post. Lord Palmerston has not resigned.' Globe, May 16th, 1834. There's no foundation for the news, Whate'er the sanguine Post may say; England has commerce yet to lose, And friendships yet to cast away. Dead are her laurels, dim her fame; But destiny has yet behind A darker doom, a fouler shame; Lord Palmerston has not resigned! What happy tidings these must be For all who hate our name and race! King Leopold is full of glee, Don Pedro wears a cheerful face; And yon old man with ringlets white, The lame, who loves to lead the blind, Is merry o'er his cards to-night; Lord Palmerston has not resigned! The scornful look, the angry tone, Are vain in our degenerate days; Resigned? Oh no! high hearts alone Can rightly value blame or praise. A nation's sneer, a nation's frown, Might awe, might fire, a noble mind; Pitt would have flung his office down!— Lord Palmerston has not resigned. L. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE. FROM DUDLEY TO EDINBURGH. “Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.”—As You Like It. Sir John is a terrible man, He is born pretty towns to beguile; Beware—oh beware—if you can, Of the magic that lurks in his smile: Though soft his entreaties may be, I've heard him as tenderly sue: For he used to come courting to me, As now he goes courting to you. A tricolor banner he bore To render his principles plain; A tricolor ribbon he wore; He'll probably wear it again. With his conduct, I quickly could see, His colours had little to do; But oh! they were lovely to me, And oh! they'll be lovely to you. He taught me, the villain, to hope, Such blessings as eye never saw; Cheap raiment, cheap victuals, cheap soap, Cheap learning, cheap churches, cheap law. You'd have thought that he spoke for a fee, So moving his eloquence grew; The arts that could fascinate me— Oh will they not fascinate you? He promised the people his aid, He gave it to Althorp and Grey; A Radical here while he stayed, A Whig when he trotted away. He swore that the Press should be free, And straight an indictment he drew; A sad disappointment to me, A sad disappointment to you! But take him; a seat must be had For Mr. Attorney, no doubt: Do take him; Lord Althorp is sad While his learned adviser is out. Since “off with the old love” is he, It's time to be “on with the new;” Detected, rejected by me, Pray take him—I leave him to you! LI. COLLOQUIES OF THE CANONGATE. “Rem populi tractas.”—Pers. Whence do you come, Sir knight, Sir knight, So gloomy and glum, Sir knight, Sir knight? “From Dudley, where stories Invented by Tories Have ruined my character quite, quite, Have ruined my character quite.” Who bade you appear, Sir knight, Sir knight, To dazzle us here, Sir knight, Sir knight? “Lord Althorp, in trouble That Pepys, my double, Is not very ready to fight, fight, Is not very ready to fight.” What have you got, Sir knight, Sir knight, To bother the Scot, Sir knight, Sir knight? “A bow and a bag And a tricolor flag And speeches well sprinkled with spite, spite, And speeches well sprinkled with spite.” What have you done, Sir knight, Sir knight, About the True Sun, Sir knight, Sir knight? “I've shown that with reason A Lord may talk treason Which a Commoner ought not to write, write, Which a Commoner ought not to write.” What shall we see, Sir knight, Sir knight, If we make you M.P., Sir knight, Sir knight? “You'll see me depart With my hand on my heart, Very grateful and very polite,—lite, Very grateful and very polite.” How will you cure, Sir knight, Sir knight, The ills we endure, Sir knight, Sir knight? “I've just got a notion Of making a motion That black shall in future be white, white, That black shall in future be white.” LII. THE LATE RESIGNATIONS. “Vivant Arturius illic Et Catulus.” —Juv. 'Twas time for this; too long, too long, In sad communion of disgrace, The right have banded with the wrong, The pure have herded with the base, Sense should not be to Quackery tied, Nor Piety be linked with Cant, Nor Graham sit by Thomson's side, Nor Stanley share the shame of Grant. 'Twas time for this; they are not fit To flatter Finn, conciliate Grote, To shake their sides at Whalley's wit And strain their voice for Gully's vote; To covet Burdett's ready smiles, To credit oaths by Harvey sworn, And soothe with diplomatic wiles The burly beggar's hate and scorn. 'Twas time for this; when general gloom Enwraps whate'er we deem divine, When madness speaks the common doom Of crown and mitre, throne and shrine, 'Twas time to leave yon shameful seat To men of fitting heart and head; The drum should be by Ellice beat; The march should be by Durham led! LIII. THE SONG OF THE BELLS. “Turn again, Whittington.' Oh, whither does your Lordship run In such a fume and fret? Your task is only just begun, We cannot spare you yet: You know there's nothing half so sweet As power, and place, and pay; You can't be tired of Downing Street; Oh, turn again, Lord Grey. And you will have your Peers, no doubt, To serve you, thick and thin; To wait upon your going out And on your coming in; And fools and flatterers, slaves and thieves, Will play a pretty play With little balls and strawberry leaves; So turn again, Lord Grey. And you'll be lauded in the Globe, And laurelled in the Times; And painted in a Roman robe, And sung in scurvy rhymes: The spouting-clubs will play their pranks To make their master gay; They'll smother you with votes of thanks— Quick, turn again, Lord Grey. And Hume and Harvey will declare You speak their very tone; And Duncombe will devoutly swear Your heart is like his own: For you will noisy Denman bawl And empty Waithman bray; And you will learn to love them all— There, turn again, Lord Grey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Editor of the “Morning Post.” Sir,—The sentimental song of which I send you a copy has just been published by Mr. Chappell. The author of it has most impudently, and without any acknowledgment, adapted to his own purposes the words of an affectionate effusion which I poured forth some months ago upon occasion of the triumphant exaltation of one of my fellow-radicals to those honours and emoluments to which we all aspire. I beg you to insert the original stanzas, and to aid me in the exposure of the plagiary. My servile imitator may have the applause of the boarding-school, but justice will be done me at the Free-and-Easy. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, A Westminster Elector.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part III. 1839. I THE CONTESTED ELECTION. TO VISCOUNT MORPETH, M.P. 'Tis sweet, when winds are lashing ocean Into a terrible commotion, Amidst the elemental roar To fold one's arms upon the shore, And see another, friend or stranger, Tossed to and fro in mortal danger. 'Tis sweet, when on a field of battle The sabres flash, the bullets rattle, To choose an elevated spot, Beyond the reach of shell or shot, And watch the heroes taking pains To batter out each other's brains. In language somewhat more sublime So said a fine old Roman poet; But had he lived to know our time As you, my lord, already know it, Another verse he might have wrought, Not less sonorous, to assure us That of all sweets 'tis sweetest thought By all the herd of Epicurus, When writs are flying up and down, And folk, in country and in town, With drums and trumpets, feasts and fights, Are making burgesses and knights, To drive from Malton, quite delighted At finding Malton so united, And mark how people rob and gull Some luckless friend at York or Hull. Hard, very hard, the patriot's fate, Whom Brooks's and the stars send down To be the Liberal candidate For some extremely liberal town! Who quits his house in sweet May Fair In vain regretting and repining, While Fashion in her glory there Is fiddling, flirting, dancing, dining— Who drops the visit that was planned To Naples by his wife and daughters, Or that which Clarke and Keate command To Cheltenham for a course of waters— Who rattles from his country seat When hounds are meeting all about him, Or steals away from Lombard Street When business can't go on without him— Who leaves, in short, by hurried stages Whate'er amuses or engages, And, hanging out a ponderous flag On Crown or Castle, Star or Stag, By speech and placard makes it clear To all who see, and all who hear, That he's the man to represent The march of mind in Parliament, And play the champion or the martyr, Next session, for the People's Charter. Hark, 'tis a fine barouche and four! The ostlers to the gate are springing; Bright eyes peep out at every door; From every tower the bells are ringing. Awakened to his country's call, His broadsides say to all who read 'em, Sir Felix Froth, of Frothy Hall, Invites us, one and all, to freedom! Sir Felix Froth we must admit A moderate Whig, of moderate wit; He sips his wine, he taps his box, And lauds the memory of Fox; He thinks all jobs extremely dirty, But has not heard of one since 'thirty; He hailed Reform with pride and pleasure, But calls the Act a “final measure.” Like great Earl Grey, whose nerves were shocked One day when Doctor Carpue knocked, Sir Felix looks with dread and doubt Upon the “pressure from without;” Like small Lord John, who now grows sick Of argument by stone and stick, Sir Felix cries, “The Constitution Don't want an annual Revolution.” If Knatchbull's doctrine seems to him A superannuated whim, It does not follow he should vote With Mr. Ward or Mr. Grote; And if he'd lend his help with joy To stifle Shaw or gag Lefroy, That can't imply an approbation Of all O'Connell's agitation. In short, Sir Felix would suggest That movement's safest when at rest, And hint that Freedom would be better For here a bolt, and there a fetter. Alas! Sir Felix will discover, Ere half his canvass shall be over, That sound opinions on demand Advance, recede, contract, expand; That choice of right and wrong depends Upon the wishes of one's friends; That all from time must wisdom borrow; That white to-day is black to-morrow; And that it's hard, in public station, Midst all the changes of creation, While winds and waters veer and vary, Super antiquas vias stare. Old Shears the tailor, who has long Been sagest of the clubroom sages, Learned in Paine, in Cobbett strong, And deep in Bentham's lucid pages— In whose mysterious shop are wrought, Not vests alone, but systems, newer Than any that have yet been taught By any Westminster Reviewer— Protests that Whig and Tory both Are cut from just the selfsame cloth; Avows that from his very heart he Abhors the name of either party; And, when his man begins to wheedle, Is quite intent upon his needle. Harmodius Nibbs, the fierce conductor Of every poor man's “best instructor,” Who by an inch of odorous taper Compiles the Independent Paper, And racks his brain and dims his eyes In calling names and coining lies, Through two laborious columns simmers Against all waverers and trimmers; Applauds his own impartial pen, And roars for “measures,” not for “men.” And soon the Union frankly states By half a dozen delegates— Undaunted patriots, who assemble In council at the Cato's Head, To make confederate tyrants tremble And deprecate the tax on bread— That they've prepared a little string Of questions about everything, To which they're anxious he should say His “yes,” or “no,” without delay; And, since they all desire to show How very deeply they respect him, They'll pelt him if he answers “no,” And if he answers “yes,” elect him. Sir Felix fancies that he sees Clearer and clearer by degrees. Six years ago, he hoped and trusted, The franchise had been well adjusted; But yet the virtue of the invention May be improved by some extension; He's quite convinced—he may be wrong— That Parliaments don't last too long; But their duration, on reflection, May be curtailed without objection; He feels that every honest man Will poll in public, if he can, But votes for ballot, when he's bid, As meekly as Sir Hussey did. These trifles settled—presto, pass! The Baronet becomes a hero, And sees his hopes in fortune's glass Mount up to summer heat from zero. And now he valorously fights The battle of the many's rights; Surfeits at taverns, smokes at clubs, Harangues from wagons and from tubs; Delights all hearers and beholders, And rides on independent shoulders. Whene'er he speaks, the gazers own He speaks with Wakley's silver tone; Whene'er he stops, the gazers vow He stops with Duncombe's graceful bow. The ladies take prodigious pride In broidering banners six yards wide; The schoolboys, hurrying from their broth, Shout “Froth for ever, vote for Froth!” War's sinews are of gold, they say; Since never yet from empty pockets Came spear and shield in Cæsar's day, In Wellington's, grenades and rockets: And soon Sir Felix is afraid, In spite of chairing and of cheering, That not of cheaper stuff are made The sinews of electioneering. “Another thousand!—bless my heart! Upon my life you make me start; You can't persuade me, in my senses, It's all ‘legitimate expenses.’ When Parliament with such applause Destroyed St. Michael's and St. Mawes— Excuse me, Sir—I really thought, That seats were never to be bought; That candidates were not to hear Of flagmen, stavesmen, breakfasts, beer; In short, that we had full security For perfect principle and purity.” Fine phrases! but it seems the game Continues pretty much the same; And Liberal sentiments don't weigh, Unless combined with liberal pay. “For Queen and Country one is willing, Of course, to lavish every shilling; But, Sir, one's family, 'tis true, Must sometimes be remembered too. Miss Froth—my Lady hints, with reason— May want a settlement next season; And Harry will be begging soon Papa to make him a dragoon. I don't complain—the honour's such— But, hang it! it might cost too much.” When first from hand of truant Will A stone goes rolling down a hill, So slow it starts, with every hop You think it's coming to a stop. If in the middle of its journey You touch it, it may chance to burn ye: And do but look how very fast It leaps to level ground at last. Thus wise Sir Felix, first intending The greatest caution in descending, Quickens his pace as he advances, Discards his conscientious fancies, Sends tickets out as thick as hail, Floods all the market place with ale, Sells out his tranquil Three per Cents, Anticipates his Christmas rents, And thinks as lightly of his purse As Mr. Smith or Mr. Nurse. Yet after all the cost and pain Bestowed on dinners and on speeches, Some few are found, whose stubborn brain Nor rhetoric nor rhino reaches: Some few incorrigible Tories, Who fancy all they read is true Of Britain's liberties and glories, Of Trafalgar and Waterloo; Who say a nation ought to be Contented to be great and free, And call it sin to seek aught further By arson, robbery and murder; Who hold the country of their birth The finest country upon earth, And will not for instruction go To Jefferson or Mirabeau; Odd men, and willing to be odd, Who read their Bible, serve their God, And snap their fingers at the Pope, And wish O'Connell in a rope. On such dull bigots soft coercion May work, perhaps, a late conversion. When logic fails in grave debate, A brickbat often carries weight; When prejudice is proof 'gainst wit, A club may make a happier hit; Where these no good effect produce, A horse pond will be found of use. Sir Felix, most humane of men, Looks vastly serious now and then; Assures the Mayor he hates a riot, And begs reformers to be quiet; But yet his stiff respect for law In proper time begins to thaw; He vows it's monstrously ill-bred To take a friendly joke in dudgeon; He half suspects that Tory head Was only made for Liberal bludgeon; He sees, as plain as noonday sun That might is right, when Whigs employ it; And finally, enjoys the fun As Johnny Elliot might enjoy it. A minute more—another second— The poll is closed; the votes are reckoned. What if Sir Felix finds his place Is just the hindmost in the race? Repulsed to-day, he yet may rally His forces for to-morrow's sally. Soon, to redeem his lost position, Coppock shall frame him a petition; A Whig Committee, nothing loath, Shall at the table take the oath; Hired witnesses with tales shall ply 'em For only two pounds two per diem; While Hill shall jumble law and fact, Misstate the case, misquote the Act; And lest some unit of the quorum Should have a fancy for decorum, And stumble on the least pretence To Common Law, or common sense, The Fates shall take peculiar care To put a Strickland in the chair. II. THE POLITICAL DRAWING-ROOM. TO LADY?. Fair Lady, nor less good than fair, When I have watched your various bounty Diffusing, like the liberal air, Its love and life through half the county; When I have seen, in hut or shed, By which your fairy foot has glided, The supper dressed, the pillow spread, The fuel stored, the drug provided; When I have witnessed round your path Averted vengeance, softened wrath— The sluggard roused to honest labour, The miser won to clothe his neighbour, The tears of sorrow wiped away, The lips of childhood taught to pray; Thus, I have thought, to clasp the tie That links the humble to the high, To make the coronet more bright Before a grateful people's sight, And show in wealth the copious source Whence mercy takes its constant course— This, more than sharp and shrill debate About the sins of Church or State, Is noble Woman's public duty— The patriotism of British beauty. But belles there are, whose proud enjoyment Affects a more sublime enjoyment; Who love their country with such kindness, Despite its baseness and its blindness, That, not content to charm and bless it, They must reform it and redress it; Who, bright with every natural grace, With ?'s figure, ?'s face, To make themselves quite overpowering, Must write like Bentham, talk like Bowring. Go, gaze on all the wondrous things, The skinny, scaly, feathery, furry, Which science from the wide world brings To pine in Middlesex and Surrey— Read tomes of travels—Clarke's and Cook's— And lounge through gallery and Museum, And open all the folio books Of pictures at the Athenæum; You'll own at last, of all the creatures, With various forms and various features, That daily walk, and swim, and fly About the earth, the sea, the sky, You find the oddest on your notes— A Radical in petticoats. Thanks to Sir Matthew's useful Bill, Once more the house is counted out; We'll step to George Street if you will, And look at Lady Daisy's Rout. Since every beast and every bird In the huge Ark together trembled, Oh when was such a motley herd Of living creatures e'er assembled? Quacks, knaves of every rank and station And creed and tongue and hue and nation, Precursors, Liberators, Chartists, Christinos, Masons, Bonapartists, Cigar consumers, opium chewers, Bad novelists and worse reviewers, Commissioners, inspectors, clerks, John Wood, John Mill, Joe Hume, Joe Parkes! Sweet Lady Daisy, formed by Venus Best specimen of all the genus— For since man's ears by trash were tickled Trash ne'er from lips more lovely trickled— Oh what could make her, with those eyes As deeply blue as summer's heaven, So sagely witty, gaily wise, And hardly—hardly twenty-seven, With such a person, such a purse, So many thousand pounds and graces, With such a pen for prose and verse, Such taste in lovers and in laces— Oh what could make her bear to be The very curious thing we see? A radiant jewel vilely set, Half Jacobin and half coquette, A rebel in the softest silks, A kind of muslin Mr. Wilkes, Bright student, but of dullest knowledge, Fair scholar, but in foulest college, In spite of nature's lavished store— Youth, beauty, talent, wit—a bore! When Johnny Campbell, in a queer rage, Denounces all the British Peerage, And tears to rags the robe his heir A few years hence intends to wear— When Joseph Hume, the cunning man, The wondrous Cocker of Kilkenny, Elucidates the newest plan To spend a pound and spare a penny— When Colonel Thompson's loyal warning Reminds us of the hallowed morning On which prophetic cricks perplex The stiffness of all royal necks— When Lord John Russell vents his spleen Against a Bishop or a Dean— When great O'Connell dubs at once Wellesley a dastard, Peel a dunce, The world admits, in all such cases, How well the work the workman graces; But out alas!—'tis what in France Our neighbours call a “false position,” When elephants will hornpipes dance, Or Lady Daisy lisp sedition! What strange and unconnected matter You hear the lovely lady chatter! 'Tis now the Spirit of the Time, And now the fashions of the season, And here a little bit of rhyme, And there a little bit of reason; That clever paper in the Globe, And Lady Jersey's charming robe; Ingenious Carson's newest toque, And funny Buller's latest joke; Deep thoughts upon the nation's debt, Fine praise of Elsler's pirouette, [Sermons] against patrician vices, And eulogies of Gunter's ices! III. THE TREASURY BENCH. TO VISCOUNT PALMERSTON. King George the Third in Cockspur Street Sits fast and firm upon his seat, Though wickedly the rabble chat About his coat and queue and hat, Though boys, irreverently pert, Bespatter him with mud and dirt, And men of proper taste declare The creature has no business there. But we, my Lord, confess at last, Though you've your spiteful critics too, That quite as firm and quite as fast Upon the Treasury Bench are you. Opinions pass with years away; A doctrine is but for a season; If loyalty's in vogue to-day, The rage to-morrow will be treason; But whether Britain's favourite hue Be pink or orange, red or blue, We see your lordship still arrayed In party's most triumphant shade; And whether Fortune's smile or frown Set Whig or Tory up or down, We find your lordship's public views Precisely what the Dame would choose. What if in other times you fought For Church and State with Londonderry? In all he said, in all he thought, Lord Melbourne's very like him—very! What if, by Percival led on, You marched sedition's threats to stifle? From Percival to dear Lord John The step is, after all, a trifle! Canning, of course, was all divine, But Shiel to-day is just as fine; Vansittart's sums were neat and nice; But Heaven! the ciphers of Spring Rice! Though Mr. Hobhouse, as you know, Was half a rebel long ago, Sir John Cam Hobhouse now may be A man with whom you quite agree; And though 'tis certain Hume was once Blockhead and blunderer, dolt and dunce, Of late we may perhaps presume There's something to be said for Hume! Oh what a light will history shed Hereafter round your lordship's head! How consecrate to deathless fame Your great forgetfulness of shame; Of whom it must be gravely writ By pen of Whig and pen of Tory, That after making praise of Pitt, And twining wreaths for Wellesley's glory, You, that the State, through storm and calm, Might still have hands and heads to speed her, Heard Evans brag without a qualm, And polled, without a blush for Leader! Sure none should better know how sweet The tenure of official seat, Than one who every session buys At such high rate the gaudy prize; One who for this so long has borne The scowl of universal scorn, Has seen distrust in every look, Has heard in every voice rebuke, Has shrunk from Stanley's quick retort, Has winced at Wakley's cool support; Exulting yet—as home he goes From sneering friends and pitying foes— That shun him—loathe him—if they will, He keeps the seals and salary still. And truth to say, it must be pleasant To be a minister at present; To make believe to guide the realm Without a hand upon the helm, And wonder what with such a crew A pilot e'er should find to do; To hold what people are content To fancy is the Government, And touch extremely little of it Except the credit and the profit; To feel secure, when peril's near, By shutting up the eye and ear; To stop sedition's rude advances By printing Normanby's romances; To keep the Czar from mischief brewing By never minding what he's doing; To guard our colonies from harms By slyly coaxing them to arms; To share vacation's joyous hours 'Twixt Brighton's domes and Windsor's towers, And gossip here, and gossip there, With ladies dark, and ladies fair; To sketch, when Fancy prompts exertion, A note for Metternich's diversion, Or protocol, so smoothly rounded It must by twenty be expounded; When Follett presses, Sugden poses, To bid gay Stanley count the noses, And leave the Cabinet's defence To Bulwer's wit, and Blewitt's sense! To hear demands for explanation On India, Belgium, trade, taxation, And answer, that perhaps they'll try To give an answer by-and-by; To save the Church and serve the Crown, By letting others pull them down; To promise, pause, prepare, postpone, And end by leaving things alone; In short, to earn the people's pay By doing nothing every day— These tasks, these joys, the Fates assign To well-placed Whigs in 'thirty-nine. We ascertain on looking back In Plunket's tattered almanack— Where, though we know there's nothing in it To charm his lordship for a minute, A student of more humble breeding May find some scraps of curious reading— That to the noble and the wise The trust of England's destinies Appeared, when George the Third was King, To be a very serious thing. Then statesmen found in State affairs Laborious studies, anxious cares; The joyless meal, the sleepless bed, The aching heart, the plodding head; Unheeded sacrifice of wealth, Unpitied forfeiture of health; Oft, tasked beyond its utmost strength, The frail machine gave way at length, And, fainting at his post of pride, The nation's weary servant died. But things are changed. The march of knowledge Proceeds in Court as well as College. The freshman on the banks of Cam, Shall master, in a fortnight's cram, Truths which, beside those waters muddy, Cost great Sir Isaac years of study. The lisping girl, who half conjectures The meaning of a course of lectures, Shall tell you tales of gas and steam, Of which Lord Bacon did not dream. What marvel, if the art to rule Discoveries of the modern school Have made so simple, as to fit The compass of the largest wit? What marvel, if on land and sea Our destiny should guided be With hardly half as much expense Of time or trouble, thought or sense, As Mr. Meynell may be able To lavish yearly on his stable, Lord Albert on his perfumed locks, Lord Spencer on a Durham ox, Sam Rogers on his beauteous books, Or Holland on his corps of cooks? While crowds expect him and abuse, Long hours, at his official quarters, Patrons of negroes and of Jews, Whig pamphleteers and Church-rate martyrs, While drowsy clerks at last despair, And Young begins to think of dining, In lovely Sappho's elbow chair Behold our gay First Lord reclining. Forgetful in his dreamy trance Which way the noisy world is going, Of Turk or Russian, Spain or France, As little as his lackey knowing, With his bright colleague he debates The Keepsake of the coming winter, Admires the poems and the plates, Applauds the painter and the printer; Lends, too, his judgment to revise Some startling tale or soothing sonnet, Embellishes some “Scene of Sighs,” Or points some “Ode to Cynthia's bonnet;” Yet now and then a respite asks From all the literary labour, To share the sweet domestic tasks Of her, his fair fantastic neighbour; And turns from Mulgrave's dreary prose, Or wakes from Morpeth's drowsy verses, To measure baby's chin and nose, And sip his caudle with the nurses. Pity that Scandal should come by, With pointing finger, squinting eye, To hint reproach, to whisper harm, To kindle doubt, to rouse alarm; That such a course of faultless pleasure, So very proper to engage In his long listlessness of leisure A Premier—of a certain age— Should furnish food for jest and frown To Themis in her wig and gown, And entertain remotest climes, Recorded in the Globe and Times. Cruel to her, whose sullied fame Scarce yet redeems its early whiteness! Cruel to him, whose hearth became Void, void of all that gave it brightness! And cruel to the orphaned ones Whose slumber often will recall Those witching looks and winning tones! Cruel, in short, to each and all But plain John Campbell, who with ease Bore off the verdict, and the fees. Shift we the scene. More safely now The Minister shall buzz and bow In regions, where no comment rude From lip or pen shall e'er intrude. There he, the fond and favoured guest, Shall look his liveliest, gloze his best, On everything, or nothing, chatter, And smoothly fawn, and softly flatter. In curious tints shall he pourtray, To make the royal listener gay, Her pious Grandsire's stiff devotions, Her moral Grandam's serious notions, Her Uncle Frederic's bigot zeal, Her Uncle William's wish for Peel. Oft shall he whisper, deep and low, The things he whispered long ago, When in saloons he first began To be a fascinating man, 'Ere yet the high ambition rose To deal religion “heavy blows.” Oft shall he picture, with an air Not very much the worse for wear, How noble through the park she rides, How graceful through the dance she glides, How wonderful it is to see Her fingers touch the ivory key; And still, while Britain stands or falls By dint of banquets and of balls, While badinage directs the nation, And politics are all flirtation, Quick Ridicule shall smother half Of her inexorable laugh; Stern Censure, just prepared to preach, Like Gibson Craig, shall lose her speech; The Muse herself shall take upon her The prudence of a Maid of Honour, And, hushing her uncourtly spleen, Sigh gently forth, “God save the Queen!” That she may see, our Bright and Fair, How arduous is her path to fame, How much of solemn thought and care An empire's interests fitly claim; That she may know how poor 'twould seem In one who graces Britain's throne To patronize a party's scheme Or make a favourite's cause her own; That she may feel to Whom belong Alike the contest and the prize, Whence springs the valour of the strong, Whence flows the counsel of the wise; That she may keep in womanhood The heaven-born impulses of youth, The zeal for universal good, The reverence for eternal Truth; That she may seek the right and just; That she may shun the false and mean; That she may win all love and trust, Blessing and blest—God save the Queen!
