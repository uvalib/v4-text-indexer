Explicit ST PATRICK'S PURGATORY OWAYNE MILES COTTON VERSION (OM2) God Ã¾at ys so full myght, That mendede wronge and made ryght, He sente men vs to wysse The ryght way to heuen-blysse. Fyrste hys prophetys Ã¾at wer bold, Off Ã¾at was comyng Ã¾ey vs told; But Ã¾e folke Ã¾at wer yn londe Ne myght hem not vnÃ¾urstonde. To teche vs more redylye, He come hymself full pryuely, And almoste Ã¾re and Ã¾rytty ?er Sothefaste mon he dwelled here. Both yn wordes and tokenes fele He taw?te men her sowles to hele, And at Ã¾e laste, for monnus goode He dyed hymself vpon Ã¾e rode, And bow?te vs wyth hys blody syde [Fro hym that was] lorn Ã¾orow pryde; And hys apostelus forsoÃ¾e he sende, That Ã¾ey shulde Ã¾e folke amende, And to tell hem of heuen-ryche, ?ong and olde, pore all ylyche. He hadde bysshoppus gode also And oÃ¾ur prechorus mony mo, That shewed her mony a tokenyng That he ys God and sothefast kynge; Holy byschoppus somtyme Ã¾er w[o]re; That taw?te men of Goddes lore. In Irlonde preched Seynt Patryke, In Ã¾at londe was non hym lyke. He prechede Goddes worde full wyde, And tolde men what shullde betyde. Fyrste he preched of heuen-blysse, Whoeuur go Ã¾ydur may ryght now?t mysse; Sethen he preched of helle-pyne, Howe wo Ã¾em ys Ã¾at comeÃ¾ Ã¾erinne; And Ã¾en he preched of purgatory, As he fonde in hys story. But ?et Ã¾e folke of Ã¾ys contre Beleued not Ã¾at hyt my?th be, And seyde, but ?yf hyt were so, That eny mon myth hymself go And se all Ã¾at and come ageyn, Then wolde Ã¾ey beleue fayn. Seynt Patryke hymself beÃ¾ow?th, And Jhesu faste he besow?th, That he wolde som tokyne shewe, So Ã¾e pepull my?th Ã¾e bettur knowe, And Ã¾at he my?th Ã¾orow hys leue Turne hem ynto Ã¾e ry?th beleue. Our lord come to hym vpon a day, As he yn hys bedys lay; Two ryche Ã¾ynkes he hym ?af, A booke of gospellus and a staf. Wyth full glad chere Ã¾e byschop hem toke, BoÃ¾e Ã¾e ryche staffe and Ã¾e booke, And ?et be Ã¾o ryche relyquus Ã¾ere, And at euery feste-day yn Ã¾e ?ere They ben bore yn processioun Wyth full gret deuocioun. The archebysshop of Ã¾at lond Shall bere Ã¾at staffe yn hys honde. Whoso wyll wyte what hyt hatte, âJhesu staffeâ men calle hyt ?ette. God spakke to Saynt Patryke Ã¾o By name, and badde hym wyth hym go. He ladde hym ynto a wyldernesse, Wher was no reste, more ne lesse, And shewed, Ã¾at he my?th se Into Ã¾e erÃ¾e a pryue entre; Hyt was yn a depe dyches ende. âWhat mon,â he sayde, âÃ¾at wyll heryn wende, And dwelle Ã¾eryn a day and a ny?th, And holde hys byleue [a]ry?th, And come a?eyn Ã¾at he ne dwelle, Mony a meruayle he may of telle; And all Ã¾o Ã¾at doth Ã¾ys pylgrymage, I shall hem graunt for her wage, WheÃ¾ur he be sqwyer or knaue, OÃ¾ur purgatorye shall he non haue.â Als sone as he hadde sayde hym so, Jhesu wente Ã¾e bysshoppe fro. Seynt Patryke Ã¾en anon ryght, He ne stynte ner day ne nyght, But gatte hym help fro day to day, And made Ã¾er a fayr abbey, And chanonus gode he dede Ã¾erinne, VnÃ¾ur Ã¾e abbyt of Seynt Austynne. Seynt Patryke lette make ryght well A dore bow[n]den wyth iren and stele; Lokke and key he made Ã¾erto, That no mon shulde Ã¾e dore vndo. The key he betoke Ã¾e pryour And badde hym lokke hyt as tresour, And euur close Ã¾e entre so, That no man my?th Ã¾eryn go, But ?yf hyt were Ã¾orow Ã¾e assente Of Ã¾e pryour and Ã¾e couente; Of Ã¾e bysschop he moste haue a lettur, Elles hym were neuur Ã¾e better. ?et ys Ã¾at stede called yn memorye Seynt Patrykus Purgatorye. In hys tyme some were Ã¾eryn, To haue for?euenesse of her synne, That come a?eyn on Ã¾e morow; I wote, Ã¾ey tolde of mykell sorow, Of peynus, Ã¾at Ã¾ey sy? Ã¾oo, And of mykyll joye also. What Ã¾ey sen Ã¾er as Ã¾ey wente yn, ForsoÃ¾e, hy[t] was yn book wryten. Some wente yn Ã¾at bolde wore, But out come Ã¾ey neuurmore. In Steuenes tyme, y vnÃ¾urstonde, That was kyng of Inglonde, Ther was a kny?t men called Oweyn; He was Ã¾eryn and come agayn. What he Ã¾er sy?, y wyll ?ou telle, Bothe of heuene and of helle. Thys kny?t was dow?ty mon and bolde, And among [men] mykyll of tolde; But Ã¾ys kny?te fell ynto synne, And long tyme he lay Ã¾erinne. At Ã¾e laste hym rependede soore, And Ã¾ow?te he wolde do no more, But to Ã¾e bysshoppe of Ã¾at countre He wente and fonde hym yn hys se. To hym he gon hym forto shryue Of all Ã¾e synnus yn hys lyue. The bysshoppe blamede hym yn Ã¾at hete For hys synnus mony and grete. Sethen he sayde to hym at Ã¾e laste, That all hys lyf he moste faste, Forto amende her hys mysdede, Of Ã¾at he hadde mysdone and sayde. âSyr,â he sayde, ây Ã¾e beseche, As Ã¾ou art my sowles leche, Graunte me Ã¾at y mote gone To Saynt Patrykes Purgatorye anone; And when y am comen agayn, All ?our wyll y wyll do fayn.â The bysshoppe sayde, âDyÃ¾ur shalt Ã¾ou now?th, For mony a fole hath Ã¾ydur sow?th; To moche vpon hemself Ã¾ey tryste, WhyÃ¾ur Ã¾ey wente, no mon wyste.

He hyt redde and stode full stylle; Sone he wyste Ã¾e kny?th[es] wylle, And wellcomed hym yn fayr manere. âSyr,â he sayde, âÃ¾ou art wellcome here.

Then may Ã¾y sowle to heuen wende, And haue Ã¾er blysse wythowten ende.â âSyre,â he sayde, âÃ¾ou redest me well, But for my synnus, dyÃ¾ur y wyll. ThyÃ¾ur y wyll, for my synnus alle, To haue for?euenesse, what so befalle.â Then sayde Ã¾e pryour, â?yf Ã¾ou wylt so, God kepe Ã¾e fro kare and wo. But a lytyll whyle Ã¾ou moste dwelle, And Ã¾e perelles we shall Ã¾e telle.â Fyftene dayes he dwelled Ã¾ore In almesse-dedes and holy lore. At Ã¾e fyftene dayes ende, The kny?th began forth to wende. Fyrst amorow he herde masse, And afturwarde he asoyled was Wyth holy water and holy book, And ryche relykes forth Ã¾ey toke. Euury prest and euery [chanoun] Wente wyth hym yn processyoun, And as lowde as Ã¾ey my?th crye, For hym Ã¾ey songe Ã¾e letanye, And browte hym fayre ynto Ã¾e entre, Ther as Syr Owen wolde be. Ther Ã¾e kny?th kneled adown, And Ã¾er [toke] al Ã¾ur benesoun. The pryour onlokked Ã¾e dore Ã¾o, In Goddus name he badde hym go, And lokked Ã¾e Ã¾ore and turned agayn, And lafte Ã¾er Syr Owayne. Forth wente Syr Owayne, Ã¾at bolde kny?th, A whyle he hadde a lytull ly?th, But he wanted hys ly?th full sone, For Ã¾er shone neyÃ¾ur sonne ner mone. Hee hadde no mon hym to lede, He groped hys way, as he moste nede. When he come furÃ¾ur wythinne, A lytull ly?th Ã¾er gan begynne, Sone Ã¾eraftur a lytull more: Glad was Syr Oweyn Ã¾erfore. Such was hys ly?th whan hyt was beste, As in Ã¾e wynter when Ã¾e sonne goth to reste. Then wente he faste, when he my?th se, Tyll he come to a grete countre. Hyt semed well Ã¾e more wyldernesse, For Ã¾er grewe noÃ¾ur tre ner grasse. As he behelde an hys ry?th honde, A swyde fayr halle he sy?e Ã¾er stonde; Hyt was both longe and wyde, And hyt was open on euery syde, As a cloyster yn all wyse; Hyt was made yn selkowth wyse. As he Ã¾er stoode and loked abowte, Ther come fyftene vpon a rowte. The eldest of hem, Ã¾at he Ã¾er sye, Furste he sayde, âBenedycyte!â To Owayne Ã¾ey ?af har benesoun, And aftur by hym Ã¾ey sette hem down. All hadde newe crownes shafe, As prestes oweth forto haue. The eldest mon, as hyt wolde falle, He spake anon for hem alle. âKny?th,â he sayde, âfor Ã¾y synne A grete aventur Ã¾ou art inne; But God, Ã¾at dyed on Ã¾e rode, Fulfylle Ã¾y wyll yn all gode.

Ne hadde he be well ytaw?te byfore, He hadde ben loste for euurmore, For fle my?te he naw?te, but moste abyde. Then come Ã¾er deueles on euury syde, Wykked gostes, I wote, fro helle, So mony Ã¾at no tonge my?te telle; They fylled Ã¾e hows yn two rowes, Some grenned on hym and some made mowes.

We shull Ã¾e sende wynde full goode That shall Ã¾e caste ynto Ã¾e floode.â Syr Owayne kneled Ã¾er adowne, To God he made hys orysowne: âLord God,â he sayde, âfull of my?te, Haue mercy on me, synfull kny?te. Wynde and rayne ys at Ã¾y wyll, And all wederes lowde and styll. Thow kanste make wynde to blowe, And when Ã¾ou lyst, to lye full lowe. Sende me, lorde, Ã¾y swete grace, That y may Ã¾ys brygge passe. Help, lorde, Ã¾at y Ã¾erin not falle, Forto lese my labour all.â To Ã¾e brygge anon he ?ede, âJhesu,â he sayde, âhelp at Ã¾ys nede.â Hys on foote he sette fyrste Ã¾eron, And called to Jhesu ry?th anoon. He felte hys foote stonde stedfastly, And Ã¾at oÃ¾ur foote he sette Ã¾erby. He called to helpe yn Ã¾at place Jhesu, Ã¾at euur shall be and euur was. The brygge wax a lytyll bradder Then waxe Syr Owayne gladder; But when he come ynto Ã¾e mydde, Euury deuell wyth oÃ¾ur chydde, And for he sholde falle by, All Ã¾ey toke vp a grete cry. That crye, hym Ã¾ow?t, greuede hym more Then all Ã¾e payne he hadde before. NeuurÃ¾elatter, forth he wente, In God was all hys entente. So brode Ã¾e brygge wax Ã¾oo, That waynes my?th Ã¾eron haue goo. Ouur Ã¾at he come full sone, Then was Ã¾e deuell power done. He Ã¾onked God yn all hys Ã¾ow?th, That hadde hym harmelese ouur brow?th. Forth he wente a lytull whyle, The mowntenance of halfe a myle. He sawe a wall wondyr fayr, Hym Ã¾ow?te hyt lasted ynto Ã¾e ayr; Hyt was whyte and bry?th as glasse, He cowÃ¾e not wyte what hyt was. When he was ny? Ã¾erat, Agayne hym openede a fayr ?ate, Full craftyly for Ã¾e nones, Of metall and of presyous stones. Out at Ã¾e ?ate come a smell, Well ny? for joye downe he fell. As Ã¾er hadde ben all maner of flourres, Such w[er] Ã¾[e] swete sauourres; Non erdely sauour, be a Ã¾owsandfolde, My?th not to Ã¾at sauour be tolde. Then hym thow?te he was so ly?te, Off Ã¾at sauour and of Ã¾at sy?te, That all Ã¾e sorow Ã¾at he hadde sene, And all Ã¾e payne Ã¾at he hadde yn bene, All was for?eten yn hy[s] Ã¾ow?th, And of hyt he sette ry?th now?th. As he stode and was so fayne, Hym Ã¾ow?th Ã¾er come hym agayne A swyde fayr processyoun Of all maner men of relygyoun. Fayre vestymentes Ã¾ey hadde on, So ryche sy? he neuer non. Myche joye hym Ã¾ow?te to se Bysshopes yn her dygnyte. Ilkone wente oÃ¾ur be and be, Euery man yn hys degre. He sy? Ã¾er monkes and chanones, And freres wyth newe shauen crownes; Ermytes he sawe Ã¾eramonge, And nonnes wyth full mery songe; Persones, prestes and vycaryes, They made full mery melodyes. He sy? Ã¾er kynges and emperoures, And dukes Ã¾at hadde casteles and tourres; Erles and barones fele That sometyme hadde Ã¾e worldes wele. OÃ¾ur folke he sy? also, Neuur so mony as he dede Ã¾oo. Wymmen he sy? Ã¾er that tyde, Myche was Ã¾e joye Ã¾er on euery syde, For all was joye Ã¾at wyth hem ferde, And myche solempnyte Ã¾er he herde. Fayre Ã¾ey wellcomed Syr Oweyne, All Ã¾at Ã¾er was of hym were fayne. Then come to hym Ã¾ore Two bysshoppus, as hyt wore. They welcomede hym and ?ode hym by, Forto bere hym company, And schewede hym, Ã¾at he my?th se, The fayrnesse of Ã¾at cowntre. Hyt was grene and full of flowres Of mony dyuers colowres; Hyt was grene on euery syde, As medewus are yn someres tyde. Ther were trees growyng full grene, Full of fruyte euurmore, y wene; For Ã¾er was frwyte of mony a kynde, Suche yn Ã¾ys londe may no mon fynde. Ther Ã¾ey haue Ã¾e Tree of Lyfe, Theryn ys myrthe and neuur stryfe. Frwyte of wysdom also Ã¾er ys, Of Ã¾e whyche Adam and Eue dede amysse. OÃ¾ur maner frwytes Ã¾er were fele, And all manere joye and wele. Moche folke he sy? Ã¾er dwelle, Ther was no tonge Ã¾at my?th hem telle. All wer Ã¾ey cloded yn ryche wede, What cloÃ¾ hyt was he kowÃ¾e not rede, But shapte Ã¾ey hadde yn all maner As folke Ã¾at wonede somtyme her. By Ã¾e cloÃ¾us men my?the hem knowe, As Ã¾ey stode vpon a rowe, ?onge and olde, more and lasse, As hyt her owene wyll was. Ther was no wronge, but euur ry?th, Euur day and neuer ny?th; They shone as bry?th and more clere Then ony sonne yn Ã¾e day doth her. The two bysshopes turnede a?eyne, And speke fayr to Syr Owayne. âBlessed be Ã¾ou,â Ã¾ey sayden Ã¾oo, âThat haddeste wyll Ã¾ys way to goo. Purgatorye Ã¾ou haste ben inne To haue for?euenesse of Ã¾y synne; Loke Ã¾at Ã¾ou do synne no more, For Ã¾ou shalt neuur efte come Ã¾ore. We haue gone Ã¾e way Ã¾er Ã¾ou was, And we haue passed Ã¾at ylke plas. So shall yche man aftur hys day, Pore and ryche, go that way, For Ã¾er ys mony a mon alyue, That hath no power hym to shryue, Tyll at Ã¾e laste he shryueth hym for drede; Somme penaunce Ã¾ey mote suffre nede: If Ã¾ey woll now?th do here, They shall do hyt elleswhere. Suche maner men, erly or late, To purgatorye Ã¾ey mote algate. Ther mote Ã¾ey dwelle stylle, And abyde Goddes wylle, But somme frende for her mysdede, For hem do oÃ¾ur synge or rede; For Ã¾us may man Ã¾orow suche dyuyne, The soner come out of hys pyne. And Ã¾ou art mon ?et alyue, And haste gon Ã¾orow swythe; Thorow grace of God and good entent Thow art passed Ã¾at turnement, And Ã¾ou arte comen to joye and blysse; I shall Ã¾e telle what hyt ys: Thys ys ErÃ¾ly Paradyse. Her wer Adam and Eue Ã¾at wer not wyse; For an appull Ã¾at Ã¾ey ete, All her joye Ã¾ey forlete, And nyne hondredde ?er and fyftene He lyued aftur yn erÃ¾e wyth sorow and tene, And fowr Ã¾owsande and vi hondred and iiij. ?ere He was yn helle wyth Lucyfere, Tyll Ã¾at Goddes wyll was To fecche hym out of Ã¾at place, And all hys kynde Ã¾at were hym by, That wordy were to haue mercy; And ledde hem forth wyth hem, ywysse, Ry?th ynto hys owene blysse. And at hys ordynaunce we be, In joye and blysse wyth solempnyte. But when we come hym byfore, Then shall our joye be mykyll more. And euery day we wexen moo, But angeles called some vs froo. All ?yf we be out of penance ylle, Her we abyde Goddes wylle, For ?et haue we not Ã¾at dygnyte To come before hys mageste; But oon and on, as he wyll calle, At Ã¾e laste we shall come all. Euery day comeÃ¾ our fode Of hym Ã¾at for vs shedde hys blode, And Ã¾at Ã¾ou shalte fele or Ã¾ou go.â As he stode and sayde hym so, Ther come a gleme anon full bry?th, And spradde ouur Ã¾at lond ry?th. Hyt was swete and hyt was hote; Into euery monnus mowÃ¾e hyt smote. The kny?te felde Ã¾at yn glyde; He ne wyste wher he was Ã¾at tyde, Ne wheÃ¾ur Ã¾at he was qwykke or dede, Such hym Ã¾ow?te Ã¾at ryche brede. Then sayde Ã¾e bysshoppe Ã¾at be hym stode, âHow Ã¾owstedest Ã¾ou, kny?te, was Ã¾ys gode?â âOo, lorde,â he sayde, âÃ¾yn oore! Let me dwelle her euurmore.â âNay, sone,â he sayde, âÃ¾ou may not so. Agayn Ã¾ou moste algate go, And telle oÃ¾ur men what Ã¾ou haste sene, And yn what aventure Ã¾ou haste bene, For yn Ã¾e worlde Ã¾ou most dye onus, And leue Ã¾er Ã¾y flesh and Ã¾y bonus, And come yn sowle hydur agayne, Then wyll we of Ã¾e be fayne.â The kny?te sye Ã¾at he moste go, And wepynge Ã¾en he ?ode hem fro. Anone ry?te Ã¾er he fell adowne, And toke all Ã¾er benesowne, A redy way anon he fonde Ry?th ynto hys owene londe. To Ã¾e hole hys way lay, That he come fro Ã¾at oÃ¾ur day. The fyftene men he fonde Ã¾ore That he hadde speken wyth before. They wellcomede hym anon ry?th, And Ã¾onked God full of my?te. They prayde faste he sholde gon, And so he wente forth anon Home ynto hys owne contreye, For ry?th now spronge Ã¾e day. âTo pryme Ã¾ey wyll Ã¾e belle rynge, And afturwarde Ã¾e masse synge. Aftur masse, wythoute delaye, The pryour of Ã¾e abbey, Bothe wyth preste and chanoun, They wyll come wyth processyoun To Ã¾e entre the agayne, And of Ã¾y comynge be full fayne. And now be good forth all Ã¾y lyue, And loke Ã¾at Ã¾ou de ofte shryue, And when Ã¾ou art dede, Ã¾en shalt Ã¾ou wende To Ã¾e blysse wythouten ende.â Thenne swyÃ¾e to go well hym lyst, And he come hom er he wyste. To Ã¾e dore come Syr Owayne, And Ã¾er Ã¾e pryour come hym agayne, And chanonus wyth mery songe, Wyth mony a wepynge tere amonge. All Ã¾ey wer both gladde and blyÃ¾e That God hadde saued Ã¾e kny?te alyue. Fyftene dayes he dwelled Ã¾ore Wyth Ã¾e chanonus, and somdele more, And tolde what he hadde sene, And in what payne Ã¾at he hadde bene; And ofte he tolde hem, to make Ã¾em wyse, Of Ã¾e joyes of paradyse. Thenne Ã¾ey wryten aftur hys mowth, That yn londe now hyt ys kowÃ¾e. Then he toke Ã¾e crosse and Ã¾e staf yn honde, And wente forth ynto Ã¾e Holy Londe. Agayn he come, hole and sownde, And aftur Ã¾at lyuede a grete stownde In bedes and yn holy orysowne, As a mon of goode deuocyoun. And aftur, when he wexede olde, And hys body wex vnboolde, He dyede, and wente Ã¾e ry?te way To Ã¾e blysse Ã¾at lastes aye. To Ã¾at blysse he vs brynge, That of all ys lorde and kynge.
