      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST ILLVSTRIOVS AND most excellent Charles, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornewall, Earle of Chester, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Principium &amp; Mutabilitas rerum. CONTAINING A BRIEFE DESCRIPTION OF THE PALACE of old Cronos or Time; and Logos his speech concerning Mutation. Cronos, Time. Moria, Folly. Logos, Reason. 1 Be still a while yee Wolues that me deuoure, You sadder thoughts and sorrowes of my hart Which through my soule an Icy numnes powre, And wholly rob me of that better part, Which God and Nature did me once impart, Vntill I briefly can vnfold and show An accident befell me long ago. 2 Which Storie that I here intend to write, A Dreame or Vision is that me befell, When drown'd in deepest sleepes of Darksome night, I seem'd transported (how I cannot tell) Into a Palace, which did so excell For glorious structures, that mine Artlesse pen Must passe their praise, vnfit to vtter them. 3 A stately Hall me thought I entred, The Pauement set with Marble and pure Gold; An Azure roofe, with Starres illumined, And in the same a Sunne I did behold, Which seem'd by Art about the Center rold; And Siluer Cinthia thirteene times the yeare, Seeming quite darkned, and as often cleare. 4 All sorts of creatures proper to the Land, All those the watry deepe inhabiting; Or such as twice them both indifferent stand: All those the Airie Region trauelling: All Shrubs or Trees in Earth, or Sea, that spring, Framd for Mans pleasure, and his vse alone, Within these walles were wrought in wood and bone. 5 Where whilest I wandred with no small content, Gazing about, aloft I chanc't to spie These lines: Thou Mortall that art hither sent To Cronos house, prepare thy selfe to die. This toucht me deepe: for often heard had I Of cruell Cronos, and his cutting Sithe, Oft (tho I felt it not) th'effects did lithe: 6 But streight there did before mine eyes appeare, A wanton Dame that came with follick grace, Moria vaine, who scoft my drooping cheare: Faint Heart (quoth she) what meanes this sorrow base? Can lustie Youth teare Cronos wrinckled face? This Dotard shall not find thee many a yeare. Loe, while he sleeps, Ile steale his Wings and's Geare. 7 This said away she went, and streight return'd, Bringing a Reade whereon she got astride. Me thought 'twas braue to see her thus adorn'd. Two wings she fitted then with nimble pride To her owne shoulders hanging downe each side; And to be sure Times Glasse should not run out, She broke that all, and strew'd the sand about. 8 Then (quoth she) for thy Hat (and reacht her wing) Pluck out this feather 'tis an ornament For all my followers well fashioning; And such as scorne old Cronos detriment. Come, let vs spend our time in merriment; Let's laugh, let's gather Flowers Here many a Dance She learnt me, and much wanton Dalliance. 9 But streight she vanisht euen as Phantasines doe, Or Demons, which doe ayrie shapes acquire; When Cronos in the throng himselfe did show, And both his old armes, and his Sithe did tire With killing, and left me her tales t'admire: For, noting Cronos had both Sythe and Wings, I thought her false, and long'd to know these things. 10 Within this Hall a world of people were, All Cronos children (yet destinguisht tho) Some Friends, and some as Seruants did appeare. Then lookt I round, wishing to see or know Some stranger like my selfe: and thinking so, A thing of greatest strangenes did afford It selfe to view, which here I will record. 11 Amongst the rest an Actor did I spie, Whose force (tho weake in shew) did Giants proue, (I say I saw, but nothing perfitly, For in a Cloud it euer seem'd to moue) A mightie Globe; it seem'd to rowle and shoue, Where millions sought with ladders still to attaine The top, but when she stird, still downe they came. 12 This made me now with more then earst I did, Some wise Oedipus to shew me all; Nor sooner had I wisht, but I descried A reuerend Syre, which gently did me call Into a secret corner of the Hall; And first of all himselfe to me he nam'd Logos, and afterward this speech he fram'd. 13 Young man (quoth he) I see thou lately art Ariu'd within this place of miserie; I am to let thee know it is my part and Office to direct this companie: Tho most of them indeed my precepts flie, Trusting Moria rather, and her Mates; But I ot thee diuine some better Fates. 14 Thou seest how here each hath his seuerall guise, Each followes his owne way, and choose their like. Some here consume their time in flatteries, And some in Pride: diuers delight to strike And kill their fellowes: others nothing like, But ease and belly-cheare (to feele, to fast) But Cronos sweepes them all away at last. 15 A few there be, whose well directed mind Retire themselues from forth the presse and throng, Whose thoughts to contemplation are design'd. Not to preuent old Cronos, nor prolong, But to prepare for what they cannot shun: And to auoid Morias cunning baites, Who first abusde the entring at the Gates. 16 Logos (quoth I) Gramercy, I doe owe To thee my selfe: th'ast cured my doubts and feares. And now my chiefe desires remaines to know Her, that behind that turning Globe appeares. Content (quoth he) lend then a while thine eares; While these feast, fight, or sleepe: my taske shall be To spend an houre vpon her Historie. 17 It is Mutation, Goddesse great of things. That in her turne doth triumph ouer all; Who tramples on the heads of mightie Kings, And makes the strongest Towres demolisht, fall. Of whom I muse, and maruaile euer shall, That ancient Rome such Temples should erect To triuiall things, and yet her power neglect. 18 For if the course of mundane things below, Be guided by the euer changing Fate Of Heauenly Orbes, from thence the causes flow Of their effects, and what they procreate. Her birth is then Diuine, and may relate, And challenge Altais tarre more due, then either Fortune, Lyeus, Venus altogether. 19 Some few examples therefore will I take, And small remonstrance from the memorie Of former times, her forces knowne to make; That men asleepe rockt by felicitie, Which vainely dreame here of eternitie, May wake and see, since Human and Diuine Things feele her force, they must account with Time. 20 That they which doe repute their states so fixt, As Lightning cannot blast, misfortune shake. Might hence obserue, the web of chance is mixt. And as they giue themselues, so must they take, Whereof examples thousands may we make From euery Age; yet shall a few suffice, Drawne both from Mens and Times best memories. 21 First, to begin with Heauen; the Heauenly Quires Haue not been euer from her powre exempt, But fell by Pride into eternall fires; From compleat Ioy, from happie true content, To be tormented there, and to torment: Where tho the rest's by one example warn'd, Yet are not men by thousand thousands arm'd. 22 The Lampes of Heauen, the Planets change aboue, As well in sight, aspect, as influence. The Sunne from his diurnall arch doth moue After his proper motion, either hence Certaine degrees, or neerer vs; from whence Proceede the diuers seasons, Autumne, Spring, Winter &amp; Summer, whose change, change ech thing. 23 And gadding Phœbe, whose still changing face, Doth so much spot her female chastitie, Varies not onely in her way, but pace; And to our seeming in her quantitie, Which some ascribe to excentricitie. But all of them till Plato's yeare be run, Stray from the place of their creation. 24 The Elements, on which each thing's composde. (Beneath the Moone) beeing and Vegetiue To daily transmigrations are disposde, And mongst themselues retaine a mutuall strife Each to become other (much like our life) Ayre doth sometimes to Fire or Water run; And Fire an earthly habit doth put on. 25 Some thinke, the Ayre in hollow Caues condenc't To be the Founts of Orenoque or Rhyne: But all men see the vapours which incenst And ratified, ambitiously doe clime To th'Ayres cold Region, whence they streight decline To snowie Clouds conuerted, then to raine, And seeking so their natiue place againe. 26 The hot drie Fumes with watery clouds shut in, Enuiron'd round, and as in prison gyude, To struggle streight for liberty begin. Tho long in vaine repulst on euery side; Vntill at last (enflamde) they flames forth glide, Shunning their foes embracements, while their thunder Amaze the people, both with feare and wonder. 27 The Winds still change, the Seas still ebbe and flow; The Dayes succeed the Nights, Nights follow Dayes. The chequered Meades giue place to Frosts and Snow; And cloudy Winter, when the Sunne displayes His Sun-daies suit, her stormy Campe doth raise, And yeelds to conquering Time, as Time must doe To him that Earth shall change, and Heauen to. 28 Who maruels now if haplesse Adam fell From Innocence, and from his blest estate, His earthly part being stuffe so mutable? Subiected vnto change by lawes of Fate, And influence of Starres contaminate Amongst things euer changing here confinde? Or that to's issue he this plague resignde? 29 VVho maruels now, that Princes great and wise, Are subiect to her powre mongst other things. Th'Assirian Monarchs, whose great Emperies, Reacht VVesterne Cadiz, first example brings; First, King, then Mad-man, Beast, yet last a King. And Zerxes he that made the Mountaines flote, Who fled from Salamine with one poore bote. 30 That Crœssus, whom old Solons wit implor'd, To censure no man happie till his end; Those hidden Caskets that he so ador'd, Proued but a bayte his Neighbour King to send To's burning, where recording this his Friend, His foe admonisht giues him Life and State, Least some should make him like vnfortunate: 31 Cæsar and Pompey, that with tragedies Fild this Worlds grand cirque. Iugurth, Hannibal, Cassius, Brutus, both the Anthonies, Make all repayment when reuenge doth call; And some by foes, some by themselues doe fall: But diuers others farre more strangely feele Th'effects of our great Goddesse changing wheele. 32 Great Marius, sprung but from rusticke syre, And in the fields of Arpos nourished; First, but a Legionarie, rising higher, Was sixt time Consull; lastly, banished, In ruin'd Carthage forst to beg his breed: Yet after all, by lands and seas thus tost, Dyde with farre greater glories then he lost. 33 Why should I heare Sertorius relate, That tasted earst so many ebbs and flowes? Agathocles? or wofull Methridate, Then whom none tasted greater wealth or woes? Valerian (Sapor, Foot-stoole) each man knowes. And, Gelnier, Vandal Prince, compeld to beg Three things, a Spunge, a Harpe, a Loafe of bread. 34 But no example doth illustrate more The powre of our Mutation, then the pride Of Baiazet, whom Turkey did adore, Coopt in a Cage that Dog-like liu'd and dyde, But here at home I Vertue haue espide Eclipst; the Brittish Eleduras thrice Enthron'd, deposde; and our late Edward twice: 35 The Courts where heretofore the Troian Knights And all this Asiatique pompe did keepe; And where the tents were pight of haughtie Greekes, Now on their backe the Plow-man furrows deepe, And silly Shepheards feede their nibling Sheepe. Stupendious Babell to, that lasting wonder, Lies with her name entomb'd, her ashes vnder. 36 And Babilon (where Chaldian Ninus raign'd, And Percian Cyrus conquered) by whose Towres Heauens studded Canopie did seeme sustain'd; Her guilted Streetes, her vaulted Orchards, Bowres, And pleasant soyle, made fat with fertill showres, To dens of Beasts and Theeues conuerted be, And barren Sands, as Esay did foresee. 37 Where's stately Iericho and strong Acre? What's Egypts Thebe, her Alexandria? Where's Ecbatane, and mightie Niniuie? What's ancient Sydon and Casa[illeg.]a? And Tyre, whose Daughters Leptis Vtica, And Carthage? tho they life to others giue, Haue long agoe themselues disseast to liue. 38 What of th'Ephesians glorie is become, Built for the honour of Diana's grace? The stately Temple of proud Cizicum, Where Golden veynes did cimment and enchase Each costly Stone? Alas, in deepe disgrace. The Labyrinthes of Candie and of Nile? Some no where found, the rest are ruins vile. 39 What's now the shells, where sometime Athens grew, And Lacedemon that so much did prize VVise Solons and Licurgus Lawes? where's now. Delightfull Baia with her Luxuries Great Cuma to entomb'd in ruins lies? And moderne Rome doth now no more extoll Her selfe for Vaults, Circques, Collumnes, Capitoll. 40 Nor doth our Grandam singlely admit These markes of hers and changes in her face, VVhereby she seemeth like a Louer stript Of choisest Iewels, yeelding chiefest grace, But her rich intrals suffer in like case; Euen Tagus Golden streames are growne so poore, Because the Hills their tributes pay no more. 41 And but that Nature like a frugall Dame, Doth in her secret Cabinet still hold Some thing for after times (for feare the shame Of pouertie should brand her being old, Or Children taxe her of vnkindnesse) Gold, Rich stones, and Minerals, this lauish time, I thinke, to glase their places would resigne. 42 And yet not these alone her forces feele, Paying Alleageance to her powerfull Name; Not Angels, Stars, Fire, Ayre, Men, I ownes, Gold, Steele, But Countries and whole Nations doe the same; But euen Religion subiect doth remaine To change to in externall forme and place, That men mistake her Robes, her Rites, her face. 43 For (all her old apparell throwne away, Both Arons Ephod, and his Incense too; And all those Lambs and Goats that each where lay On fuming Altars) her old seruants now Mutinie against her, her new tyres mis-know; And while themselues lie plung'd in Hell black night Of Ignorance, say others lack their sight. 44 The place where earst were holy Couenants made, And where Iehoua Marriage knots did knit With his deare Spouse, now darknes doth inuade, And Irreligion and vncleannesse sit Triumphing with an insolence vnfit, And true Religion banisht quite away, Is no where knowne within those coasts to stay. 45 And Rome where once the Martyrs blood did raine, To moist the seed of Christianitie. Africk (tho neerer to the Sunne) and ( ) In vtter darknesse now be nighted lie, And know it not (the greater miserie.) Faire Italy that counted once the World All Barbarous, for barbarismes abhord. 46 Religion there's become a very scorne, Their Cannons and traditions haue her place, Which like false witnesses they still subborne, To testifie vntruths against her face: But not content to doe her one disgrace, Simonie, Murder, Pride, Hipocrisie, Lust, Blasphemy, exile her vtterly. 47 Againe, the North that sometime did produce Nothing but darknes, that did nought good keepe In her frozen mansions, nought but Snowes, Fogs, Dews, And Icie Mountaines floting in the deepe; The foster of Stupiditie and Sleepe, The parent of vnpollisht saluage minds, Both fierce and bloody, like the Siluane kinds, 48 Is now become more blest then other Climes, For pure Religions true profession: For (that which was denide to former times), Her warme Zeale thriues, euen in the coldest Zone: For here with vs Religion hath her Throne; Iustice and Mercie tend at either hand, And Truth, her Vsher, doth before her stand. 49 Behind her come Humilitie and Peace, Plentie and Charitie (both wondrous ag'd) And tho Bellona and [illeg.]rennis fierce, Alecto and the Furies all enrag'd With this her glorie, haue themselues engag'd Against her traine, in hope to worke her spight; Yet guards of Angels throw them at her feete. 50 And all her Courts with Princely Seruants shine: The best of Kings her Harrold is become; Proclaiming both her worth to present Times, And to succeeding Ages; while his owne (Our lasting Time) eternall shall become. Then Arts and Armes, and all the other Graces, Are ranckt about her in their seuerall places. 51 But now, deare Clio, I thine aide implore, T'impart some portion of thy sacred skill, Or sweete Euterpe of thy Nectard store, Into my braine some scruple to distill, Till I haue showne with this my rustick quill, The various change of Body and of Mind By Logos, to this Microcosme assign'd 52 This lesser World (quoth he) the great ones map Of Fire and Water, Earth and Heauen composde: The Sea of change, the subiect of mishap; The Bulwarke gainst a world of foes exposde. Oh that the Heauens had vnto me disclosde, To write the wonders of this little thing, Which learned Legists call the Worlds great King. 53 The wondrous changes which it doth admit, First, from not being once, to come to bee; Then from a rude vnpollisht Chaos yet, For to be framde a thing to heare and see: And from a thing of such infirmitie, That creepes amongst the dust, and licks the mold, To grow a Man of Courage stout and bold. 54 Then from a thing of such accomplisht forme, VVhom Nature hath decreed with all the best, Both of her skill and treasures to adorne VVith fairest beauties, hauing right imprest Both Soule and Body; farre before the rest Imparting wit, and memorie to know Both things aboue, and in the earth below. 55 VVith crisped looks out-shining Libian Gold; VVith skin for whitenes passing Atlas snow; And teeth, the Pearles in stately Ormus sold; And cheekes, the Roses that in Iurie grow: VVhose eies like two pure Christall Heauens show; VVhose lips as Cherries, breath as incense sweete, And tongue as sweetest Musick doth delight. 56 That such an one should in a span of Time Be thus disrobde of all this excellence, So chang'd, I say (by misterie diuine) For our first Parents haplesse high offence, To wretchednes, and deprauated sence, And that those dimpled truest Venus balls, VVhere th'mirthfull Goddesse keepes her Festiualls. 57 Should turne like those scratcht by the Beldam Ape, Where Tabraea her shadie Groues displaies. What change of more amazement can one shape, Then this Times Map of ruine and disgrace; Deafe, Sinew-shrunke, the storie of ill dayes; Callender of Disease, which last returnes All frosted ore, a banquet for the Wormes. 58 Now here againe an Ocean should I enter, Of stormie billowes, where these barkes of yours Are bruisde and beaten, while abroad they venture From our knowne coasts to gather gawdy flowres, With vaine Moria in her fatall Bowres; Where gainst the Capes of Pride and Lust they run, Oft split before their Voyage be begun. 59 The passions of the Soule I should expresse, Which is a sea of more extended bound; And where more rudely crossing billowes presse Each other, then in th'Ocean can be found In Malstrom, or the Magellanick Sound: For here ten thousand contraries remaine, Both frozen Ice, and Aetna's burning flame. 60 Camelions doe not colours faster change Then these affections: nor doe idle men In waxe or paper forme more anticks strange Then may be noted in the soules of them, Whom Logos doth not compasse in, and hem: New passions, and irregular desires, New motions and mutations turning Gyres. 61 While tost with feauours and contrarie fits Of seeming zeale, but true Hypocrisie, Now Hope wins ground, and streight Despaire that gets; Now Auarice, now Prodigalitie; Now haughtie thoughts, then great Humilitie; Both burning Anger, and chill frozen Feare, Doe in their turnes insult and dominere. 62 Enuie, Reuenge and Malice others whet, To perpetrate in human bloody acts, By Sword and Poyson their intents to get; Or (worst of all) by some infernall pacts: Which done, the sweetnes of those filthy facts Turne into horror and confounding feare, They wish ten thousand deaths, their c?science cleare. 63 Many there be that with Ambitions car. Doe madly seeke to clime the Alpine Mounts, To get beyond all stormes and Meteours far: But find themselues much short of their accounts, Not free from Stormes and Lightnings, at the founts Of all those mischiefes rather; and repent That euer neere such steepe discents they went. 64 Men seeke for things they wish they had not found; They wish for that which makes them oft lament; Lament that lost, which made their griefes abound, And grieue for lacke of that they must repent: If had, men kisse and kill incontinent. They pine with loue, and yet extreamely hate, Whom so they lou'd, with hauing saciate. 65 Now plumpe cheek't mirth, now sadnes they commend, Now sweet content yet plunge themselues in care: To fatting ease, and sleepe their Youthes they bend, And in old Age, their limbs forget to spare Toyling for gaine, whereof they loose their share, Both thanks and trauaile: thus are mortall Hearts The stage where vainest Actors play their parts. 66 Sometime they praise the Countrie, then the Towne; Now high estate, now humble, low degree, Now fruitfull trauaile, streight soft beds of Downe; Now Courtly greatnes pleaseth: by and by The life retired, and leasure for to die. Now bloody Ensignes, and the Cannons sound; Th? streight way Peace, wh?ce sweeter tones redound. 67 The married man commends the single life, And libertie detesting to be tide To still renewing cares, and wanton strife: Yet (freed againe) he cannot so abide. He pines, till he some second warre haue tride In all affections gidd'ly they roue, Not constant what to hate, or what to loue. 68 No certaine state of goodnesse doe they proue, Or badnesse here: for both doe by degrees Vnto their proper periods still moue. Hell is the end assign'd to those that leese The time, and grace ordaind to them: but these That by the staires of Vertue vpward past, Meet with perfection in the Heauens at last. 69 Now since the Heauens, and the Celestiall Quires, And all the Elements thus change. We see Since Princes, Cities, stateliest Towres, and Spires, In time demollisht and forgotten be. Since all things taste of Mutabilitie That God created; let none thinke it strange, That Times are chang'd, and we in them doe change. 70 This said, my Vision vanisht, and reuoluing Logos discourse within my troubled brest; And (notwithstanding my knowne wants) resoluing To keepe that piece which in my mind did rest, These Lines I limbd, whereof you are possest, Whose vse is this, that Man (a changling euer) Might learne to worship him that changeth neuer. Cursus &amp; Ordorerum. Or ART AND NATVRE. 1 The Winter past, and Phœbus now begun T'approach our Northerne Tropick, to reuiue His tender Infants hid in Flora's wombe, And with his beames their fetters to vngiue; When Men and Plants seem'd to receiue new life, Themselues attiring in their best array, To honour Phœbus, and adorne the day, 2 I (onely I) clouded in discontent, Wrapt vp in woe, stung with misfortunes strokes, Hiding my selfe, my sorrowes so to vent, In solitarie vnfrequented Rocks, Which Thetis as enamor'd on, fast locks Within her armes; here keeping of my Sheepe With Morpheus Charmes, my sences fell asleepe. 3 If I did sleepe I dream'd: if waking were; There was endeed presented to mine eye Two Royall Queenes, whose persons did appeare The types of beautie, and of soueraigntie, Surpassing saue seem'd that, this faire and high: That lowly seem'd of modest complement, This courtly, gracefull, and magnificent. 4 That on her brow a rosie Chaplet bore, A Lilly, for a Scepter in her hand; A Kirtle to of grassie greene shee wore; Wherein with cunning skill did painted stand All liuing creatures proper to the Land: All sorts of Trees, Shrubs, Flowres, and Vegetals, Both costly Iems, and hidden Minerals. 5 Here siluer streames slide through th'enameld Meades, Where towring Cedars, tufts of Mirtle seeme. Here fed the frisking Cunnies, there the Heards; And in this cirque three battailes strange were seene, The Dragon and the Elephant betweene; Betwixt th'Ichnewmon, and Niles monstrous King; Th' Aspe and Camelion, whose Spit quits her Sting. 6 The Phenix then (of winged things) was not, Nor th'neat House-wright Sea-charming Halcyon; Nor was Molluca's plumy bird forgot, That hath no Nest nor Cradle for her young, But her Males hollow backe, where fast tide on With their owne strings, they restlesse euer row Through th'Ayre (their fare) and wretched faith nere know. 7 The little Tomancio here I spide, And she whose forehead beares two burning Lights, And two beneath her wings, which serue to guide The cunning Workemans hands in darkest night: And she of which the Brittaine wonders writes, Fish, Fowle and Fruite: nor was she lesse adorn'd Byth' seed to worme, fr? worme to flie, transformd. 8 Here all the Flowres of Tauris, Padoa; And all the Plants the Easterne Orchards yeelds, Vpon their Downie Carpets smiling Lay: And all the Druggs and Sweetes of Indian fields, And Balsam, for which Egypt strong wall's builds. The Cinamon, the Sugar-caine, the Vine, And hallowed boughes that weepe those fires diuine. 9 The Indian Roote-tree shading miles of lands, Whose moyst boughs make the coolest Galleries. The feeling Shrub, that shrinkes from human hand. And mournefull Tree which still at Phœbus rayes Puts off her, Flowres, nights beautious liueries. The Lote was here that seemes to seeke her Louer: And th'Iron tree, not Iron, but his Brother. 10 Vpon her shoulders then a Scarfe she had Of party colours, gray, red, blew and greene, In which the pourtraicts of each thing was made, That in the licquid regions may be seene; Both friendly Fish, and Monsters fell and keene, Mongst whom th'earth neuer touching Dolphin bore Chiefe place, that set th' Laconian Harpe ashore. 11 The Tyburone was here, whose nimble fin Out-strips the fleetest Sayle in swiftest flight. Th' Echynis, stay-ship Remora next him, Tho small of body, yet of greatest might. The burning Starre was here that shines so bright, Whose touch feares all things; and although it drench In deepest waues, yet water cannot quench. 12 The double sighted Elops to was here. The Cramp-fish to, that makes the Fisher lame: Tritons like men: and some whose heads appreare Like rocks. The Morse that at reliefe is tane, Sea-Vnicorne, Oxe and Hippopotame, The monstrous Rhoyder, and the Oylie Whale, And she that with her turning wheeles may saile. 13 Within this Scarfe were intertexted to, Three battailes that my wandring eyes beguile: A scull of Dolphins first that each yeare goe Procession to their brinie bounds in Nile, Whom to repulse attends the Crocodile, But to his cost: for tho he's arm'd each where, Saue vnder's belly, his false foe speeds there. 14 The next was of the Sword-fish and the Whales; The Sword fish aided by the Thresser-fish: The last, where Man this monstrous Fish assailes, Whose haughtie thoughts acquire true fame in this; Since a small cord, and Harping-iron is The engine, which being launc't at him asleepe, Doth captiuate the King of all the Deepe. 15 These few I noted of her ornaments, Before mine eyes did to that Goddesse moue, Which seemd like Pallace, when her course she bent Through the blew welken with the Queene of Loue, And iealous Iuno, when with gifts they stroue To bribe the Troian Boy vnto their wills, That fed his Snow-white Lambs on Idaes Hills. 16 Nor had she onely prudent Pallace grace, And sacred wisdome, but did more containe That Maiestie and Beautie in her face, VVhich men ascribe vnto the other twaine. In briefe, she had no blemish, nor no staine, But rather seemd more faire then in her Youth; A wonder, and but few will thinke tis truth. 17 In a triumphant Chariot did she sit, By which the tother captiue-like did stand; Beneath her feete a Globe, a foot-stoole fit; That hand a Booke, this bore a siluer VVand, VVhose powerfull charmes doth stocks and stones command, Lyons and Tygers and vpon her backe Two wings she had, th'one white, the tother blacke. 18 Vpon her head a Corronet she bore Of rich Arabian Pearle her Curles to stay; A Syndon Vayle of Belgia she wore, VVrought full with quaint workes of Hesperia: A Purple Robe of Macedonia Vpon her shoulders, and with cunning rare Therein were wrought ten thousand works most faire. 19 In stead of Genness, or of Flemmish Mares, Two Eagles and two Elephants had she: And for to mannage such vnequall paires, Two mightie Giants, Gaine and Fame went by To whip them on; the Coach-man, Industrie: Plentie and Pleasure Lacquies were assign'd; Vertue and Honour came as Friends behind. 20 And in this Chariot she was mounted hie In a high Seate, which Contemplation hight Sustain'd by foure VVheeles which doe make it flie, VVherein in Golden characters were writ, First, Logick, in the second Rhetorick; Next, Musick and Arithmatick still prest, To count the stops, strifes, errors of the rest: 21 Beneath vpon her very skirts, mine eye Ten thousand Flowers, and precious beauties spide: (For neerer I presume not, nor more high, It might be construed arrogance and pride For him that there so little hath descride:) Ten thousand neate conceits and textures there, Strange workes and rare inuentions did appeare. 22 Therein were wrought ten thousand Instruments. Ten thousand Wheeles, measures of swift Time: Ten thousand Engins strange for rare intents, Such as Archimedes his wit diuine, Deuisde for Ladders vp to Heauen to clime, To steale the motions of the Starres, and here For to comprise them in his Vitrean Sphere, 23 All scattered round about her skirts there lay A thousand Cities wrought by cunning hand, Where battlements and steeples did display Their loftie pride; 'bout some of which there stands Braue Troopes of plumed Horse, and Footemens Bands, Squadrons of Pikes to guard the thundring shot, Some seeming forc't, some force regarding not. 24 Let the Reader looke for the rest of the Notes at the Iatter end. the Poem, by reason of the too largenesse of them. Here to the life were wrought the Nauall Fights. Sallamine, Actium, Corinth; where the Armes Of East and West contended 'bout their rights; Whilest Neptune laught, gaining by both their harmes: Tho Europe aye triumphes, who with loues charmes Hath so entangled Neptune, that he still Is most obsequious to performe her will. 25 Much more I saw which Time and mine intent Of breuite will not permit me say; Which while I pondring stood, these Ladies bent Their course to me, me thought with this array, And with this equipage: the truth to say, Much did I muse what such a Soueraigntie, Might haue to doe with my rusticitie. 26 And musing long what titles might be fit, What complements might best with them agree, The chiefe of them which seem'd enthron'd to sit, Thus shook me from my dumpes. Shepheard (quoth she) First know, that we two, Art and Nature be. Next, vnderstand thy Guests come from aboue, Tho mortall shee, immortall Fates I proue. 27 Thirdly, obserue that she and I haue then A certaine Argument, which of vs two Be most benigne and kind to mortall men, She Nature, and I Art. And lastly, know The censure of our Arguments we doe Wholly referre to thine integritie, To whom we equall Benefactors be. 28 (Quoth I) Great Goddesses! vnworthy most Am I into your presence for to come: Vnworthier alas to be your Host, Being thus dispoyl'd by Fortunes angry doome, Both of your benefits, and of her owne: But most vnworthy doubt I to appeare Iudge of so great a controuersie here. 29 But she replide: Doe not disestimate Thy better tallent for thy pouertie, Tho false opinion and preiudicate Of vulgar wit, with dim and dropping eie Saue Fortunes) sees not any Deitie; We know Heauen loues the poore man many time, And hates those rich, whose out-sides onely shine. 30 Our pleasure therefore is, that thou attend To heare our Arguments with diligence; Which duly heard and pondred in the end, Then shalt thou sentence this our difference, Giuing the Victor that preheminence The iustice of their cause deserues. And streight She thus began, and spake what now I write. The Speech of Art. This Dame (quoth she) of Mortalls all the Mother, Of all that be composde of th'Element, Seemes to professe, that onely Man, none other, Is the chiefe obiect whereto her care's bent, That he's her Darling, all things else but lent For his behoofe. Now I prooue she hath been, More Benefactor vnto beasts, then him, 32 For when she first into this Worlds light sends them, She kindly sutes them new at her owne cost, With clothes that can from cold and heate defend them, And still repaires their liuerie hurt or lost. Poore man comes naked to this forraine coast, And without helpe of Mid-wiues, Nurces, Clothes, He perishes: but Beasts need none of those. 33 The Foule with spread wings ore her Chickens houers: Within her armes the Ape her youngling beares: The Adder in her Maw her vile broode couers. When'th Succurathe the Hounds pursuing heares, Vpon her back a tent for hers she reares, That scornes the Hunter. In her wondrous wombe Doth the Chyurca hers as oft retombe. 34 But Neptunes tributaries, watry Nation, Tis they of men haue greatest odds in this, Blest in this kind by rights of their creation, VVhose industrie and care no greater is, About their Spawne, and breeding businesses, Then in Earths wombe to couer their election, Then leau't to Citharea's safe protection. 35 Euen to the winds and fleeting waues they throw it, VVhich seuerd from them many a mile is blowne. Why's this? Because their World's their owne they know it, Kind Nature tells them that they be at home. Then here's the first Sceane where her loue is showne; For which from greatest bountie doth proceed VVants to supplie, or take away that need. 36 Long are poore men appendixes to Mothers, And halfe their time in documents they spend Amongst their Nurses, Schoole-masters, and others, To know wherefore they liue, and to what end. Long is their Seed-time, Haruest quickly In'd: But long-liu'd beasts doe in a short time grow, Fit for those ends that Nature fram'd them to. 37 No weapons she to him at all assignes, Neither offensiue not defensiue Armes; To these she hath imparted seuerall kinds, Force to repell with force, and offerd harmes: Teeth, Clawes, Hooues, Hornes, Stings fit for hot alarmes; And for defensiue, diuers doe not want Such priuie Coates, as Shot and Pikes can daunt. 38 Of these Niles steely-sided Monster's one: The Tortoyse with his bullet-daunting house: The purple spotted yallow Champion: The Carrv-towre, that onely feares the Mouse: The Armadillo, and the Indian Boas. All these in Armour well appointed goe, And diuers diuersly defensed to. 39 She giues the Cockatrice a killing eie, The subtill Hien and inchanting foote; The Crampfish a benumming qualitie; The Cuttle Inkie humors blacke as soote To die the waues, while from the nets he scout. The Zibra venomd haires to kill her Rider; The Porcupine a neuer-empty Quiuer. 40 She hath enstructed beasts with Physicks light: The wounded Deare run streight to Diptanie. The Swallowes find out Cellandine for sight. The Dog in Knot-grasse finds his remedie. The Beares with Aron cure there malladie: T'Hippopotame knowes th'vse of letting blood; Tortoyse and Toades know Antidotes right good: 41 Each one of these, and thousands more are proud Of some kind benefit she hath them giu'n, Onely on man she nothing hath bestow'd, But tender limbes, a smooth transparent skin, Through which each little worme giues death to him: Yea, greater weaknesses in him appeares, He drinkes it often through his eies and's eares. 42 Beasts be not subiect vnto griefes, cares, feares, No future wants their present ioyes controle: Blood-drying sighes nor braine consuming teares; Heart-eating Enuie feedes not on their soule: Not Auarice nor Pride doth them defoule, Winged Ambition that enflames the brests Of mortall men, doth not disturbe their rests. 43 This said, in silence Art streight sat her downe, To let her Riuall answere what she could. So Nature rising like the morning-Sun, Whose brighter beames, moyst vapours ouer cloud. Halfe vaylde in modest blushes, long she stood At these enditements. But at last she broke Her silence thus, and for her selfe thus spoke. Here Art seemes to conclude her first speech, and giues Nature leaue to replie, as followeth. 44 Mortall (quoth she) these imputations here, And foule aspersions cast on my cleare fame, I truly must returne them (being cleare) On Art her selfe, from whence at first they came: Tis manifest that I for men ordaine One onely benefit, that ballances All these that she calls disaduantages. 45 Reason, a heauenly gift, which crownes him King Of all the Worlds so large extended bound: VVhich (tho he's borne weake, wanting euery thing) Affoords him all, with friends encompast round, (VVhom Reason doth instruct with iudgement sound) And neighbours, for to helpe at such a time; By charitie and mutuall loue men shine. 46 When he's growne vp, this yeelds him all things fit, And to him is an armour of defence. What Engins doth he frame with pregnant wit, Keene Swords and Speares, blest guards of innocence? What fiercest monster is not in suspence, To see his glistering Helme? or a'the report Of his fire-spitting musket scuds not for't? 47 All creatures feare him, as their King and Lord: For of their flesh he at his choice doth feede; For him fit clothing also they affoord, Haire, Wooll and Hide which he conuerts at neede To many an vse, such as the Heauens decreed Ere their creation, he should best deuise, To accommodate to his necessities. 48 For him the Bee makes Hony; and the Ewe And gainefull Cow for him their Milke they yeeld: For him the pritty Silke worme weaues her clew: For him, not for her selfe, the Doue doth build: For him the Flocks beare Wooll: for him the Field Doth each yeere reuell in luxurious pride: The Trees beare Fruit, and Meades are richly dide. 49 For him alone the Indian Tunall Tree Vpon her Leaues brings forth those costly Wormes That now those Tyrian Fishes wants supply. For him the Bezars and the Vnicornes Bring these their Antidotes, their Stones and Hornes. For him the Elephant his cordiall Teeth: The Cat her costly Sweat, of Sweetes the chiefe. 50 For him and for his sake alone they know The Weathers change, and times and seasons render, Not for themselues, that neither plow, ne sow, But serue the Rustick for his true Kallender: And for him onely doe examples tender Of Surgerie and Physick; losse of breath Being to them the best thing Heauens bequeath. 51 Yet this is onely halfe the good which he Receiues from beasts, whom Reason right doth guide. Of morall vertues many sparkes there be In them, which serue abundantly to chide Their haplesse Master, when his foote doth slide: The greatest griefe that wise men ere befalls, To see their shame in brutish animalls. 52 Of these there be prouided many a one, Faire Characters, wherein poore erring men May reade their duties. First, the Halcion, True patterne of coniugall loue: for when Old age enfeebled hath her mate, the Hen Forsakes him not, but helpes his weake estate, Because in youth he was her louing mate. 53 They haue the Doue to shew them Innocence, The Pellean to teach paternall loue: The Swallow to ouercome by patience; Filiall dutie doth the Storke approue: The losse of friends the Turtle true doth moue To sollitarines: for Industrie They haue the Silk-worme, Ant, and pretty Bee. 54 The profitable Oxe, and ready Horse, The map of courage, and of mortall pride: The Elephant of most admired force, And diuers things domestick to beside, To obedience and humilitie him guide: For these acknowledge some small benefits, Which he for many great ones still forgets. 55 The silly Cur still at his Masters foote, Which patterne of an honest seruant is, Which knowes his Masters friends, and who be not; Defends his goods, and suffers nought amisse; He prompts him still with his good qualities, Being the mirror of fidelitie, Of perfit friendship, magnanimitie. 56 And wherefore this? to teach the vngratefull man: (Vnworthy Banister I thinke on thee, Which sold thy Noble Master Buckingham) That thankfull Dogs then those men better be, Which fawne and flatter that prosperitie Which feeds them: but if Fortune frowne, Then soonest bite, and helpe to pluck it downe. 57 The venombde Aspe, whose vengeance few can shun (The poyson of his angry mind is such) I force from lothsome caue to light to come To teach those minds, whose soules no vertues touch, That Iustice hath with men endured so much; She flies to wormes, whom neither hate nor loue Can make vniust like wretched men to proue. 58 I cause the fiercest beasts of sea and land, The Dragon, Lyon, Sealie Crocodile, To know their Masters, and t'endure his hand, Growing domestick seruants in short while; To teach in human man that will defile His hands with blood of those that nourisht him, That bruitest beasts and Serpents thinke it sinne. 59 I bring the raging Lion from his den In Nubian Desarts, where he vsde to pray On weary passengers and trauelling men, Whose hard misfortunes led them to his way, Vnto Romes publike Theater to display, That benefits euen saluage beasts doth bind, Tho thankfulnesse seeme fled from human kind. 60 I bring the King of Pegues shady Groues, From vnfrequented saultes and places strange, To teach Man that his owne way still approues, Only how-euer crookt and wide it range, With streighter pathes of noblest beasts to change, Whose many vertues wise mortalls discouer, Deuot, iust, faithfull, thankfull, glories louer. 61 A world of which examples may be found In birds and beasts euen those of brutest kind, From whence to men great profit might redound, If ponderd well they were, and borne in mind. Such letters faire, as might instruct the blind. For what is he that will not vertue loue, When Lions, Tigers, Serpents it approue? 62 This said, me thought Art thus againe replide: Blind Nature would betray the erring Man, Who woes thee thus to follow her (blind guide) VVhen I alone thy prudent Tutresse am; Teaching thee both the Monsters fierce to tame, And to get soueraigne Antidotes from these That hurt thee worst, and choycest remedies. 63 The silly rurall person, if he meete The cordiall flowers, the Vyolet or the Rose, He passes by, or treads them vnder feete, Euen things that greatest vertues doe enclose: VVhilest he diseasde might oft be cured by those; Time, Hysop, Dodder, Anthos, that do grow In's Garden, he them knowes, but doth not know. 64 His Cow, his Sheepe, his Pullen and his Swine, Containe ten thousand vertues hid in them, VVhich might preserue his life at many a time, If Nature were not blind, depriu'd by sin, Of her true light; and therefore this light's gi'un By Heauen to me, that I might it dispose To those, whom God for this end fittest knowes, 65 I teach him from the Scorpion to get An Oyle, the Antidote against her teeth. Nothing against the Vipers sting so fit As Metridate, where her owne flesh is thiefe Ingredient. Nothing giues more reliefe Forth' Water-Snakes sting, or the mad Dogs tooth Then their owne liuers sod, and eaten doth. 66 What thing more horrid then the Crocodile? Few parts of him which are not physicall. Who at the angry Elephant dares smile? Who trembles not? His teeth are cordiall. The Toad yeelds me a stone medicinall. The Serpents Caymans, and fell Tyburones They doe the same; so doth Lincurions. 67 Nor doth she lesse her selfe mis-vnderstand, That to her selfe doth arrogate the praise, In morall vertues, for instructing man; Since I therein enlight him with my rayes, And teach him to apply such things alwaies To his owne good, for such as know not me, By such examples nothing better be. 68 Witnesse Brasile, Peruuia, and all The saluage Nations of the Westerne world, Where Nature hath been each way prodigall: Yet are their minds and manners most abhord, Which few signes of humanitie afford; Of vertue none, Man-eaters, bruite and euill. Not seruing God, but worshipping the Deuill. 69 Those that haue seene faire Florence, or the Towres Of Naples G[illeg.], or aged Rome, Or Regall Tauris thy delightfull Bowres, Or the captiue face of Constantines sad Towne; Or Pharoes Tower, which Pharoes Rocks doth crowne, Whose loftie Turrets kisse th'enamourd skies, Whose various obiects steale mens dazled eies. 70 Their ornaments in Stone, Siluer and Gold Pictures in Tables wrought, Glasse, Marble, Clothes, With so rare skill, that those which them behold, Seeme chang'd sometime to these, and these to those; Their purple States, and their triumphall showes Of Princes, People, best of all can tell, How much my gifts to men doe hers excell. 71 Yet these externall gifts are poore and small, Compard with other benefits of mine, Who as a Gnomon doe direct them all To looke from shadowes, on that Sunne diuine, Which through the world both Light and Life doth shine: Since terrene beauties only shadowes be Of that true compleate Beautie, One and Three. 72 This said, her finger lockt her lip and me; She beckned streight-way with her other hand, That I enformd, now sentence should decree, Because her modestie did here command Her silence, and that we might vnderstand How much selfe-praise doth true fame interest, She ceast, well hoping I would speake the rest. 73 A taske, which pondring mine owne weakenesse right, I found my selfe lesse fit to vnder-take, Then Pigmies be with Giants for to fight; And crauing they some fitter choice would make, Euen here me thought, euen while these words we spake, A reuerend Matron entred into place, Call'd Alethia, her I shewed the case: 74 Requested her the matter to decide To heare, weigh, iudge with best discretion. To which me thought she instantly replide: Friend, for that purpose am I hither come, Therefore obserue and listen to my doome; Tho bodies great, we cannot wholly view, We iudge the whole by a part, one thread the clew. 75 Nature is faire, but Art it makes her shine. Nature is great, but Art she makes her more. Nature is wise, Art makes her seeme diuine. Nature is rich, but Art still mends her store. Nature is strong, yet doth she aide implore From Art. Art better then by consequent, Since she her strength, wealth, beauty doth augment. 76 Nature is of her selfe but a rude masse, VVhich of it selfe each day to ruine tends: VVhom Art still striues to beautifie and grace, And to preserue and forme it euer bends Her chiefe endeauour, tending still to mend VVhat errs, or wants in Nature, and to plaine Her ruder workes with some more pollisht frame. 77 Since Nature brings Man forth imperfit then, VVith sense relucting alwaies to the mind: And Art she tills and formes the soules of men, Giuing them light, whom Nature hath made blind; My sentence is to Art wholly enclin'd. Since as the ancient sages truly tell, Tis better ne'er to be, then not be well. 78 This said, my Vision vanisht: nothing staid But th'airie clouds, vast sea, demolisht Phane, My selfe and my sad thoughts, but ill appaide VVith certaine gifts they gaue me for my paine: For Nature angry and incenst with shame, Warded me sicknes: Art for all my toyle, Pouertie, cause I did her praises soyle. Opineo &amp; Ratio Rerum: Or, A DISPVTE BETWIXT WEALTH AND Pouertie, &amp;c. 1 In Winter time while Boreas with blasts keene, Had stript faire Flora of her liuerie; And all the Forrests of their beautious greene, Wrapping all in gray frozen pouertie, My Muse and I pincht with this miserie, For want of fire, and meanes good house to keepe, We went to bed, to cure our cares with sleepe. 2 Sleeping, I dream'd, that in a flintie way, I trauel'd, all with Briers and Thornes beset, Narrow, vneuen, not tracted euery day To a great Citie, and on businesse great, And in this iourney with this vision met; VVhose circumstances as they fell me there, I purpose here most briefly to declare. 3 Within this path I had not iournide long, Before a knot of trauellers I spide; A feeble sort God wot, and nothing strong. Whose names to spare the labour might betide In vaine demands (were writ on each mans side. Both the command reste, and her children two, Friends, Seruants, Horses, Wheeles &amp; Coach had so. 4 She that within the Waggon sat as chiefe, Penia hight, her rayment torne and vile: Pale wrinckled cheekes she had, through hearty griefe, Vpon her head a wreath of Gammamile; Wan were her lips, where mirth did seldome smile; Two sad slow-moouing eyes, shut casements couerd, Bout which dark-weeping clouds of woes still houerd. 5 Her children then that there beside her sat, Obedience and Humilitie. Next them Sat Seruitude, her Page and Fellow-mate. The Waggoner that did direct this frame, Was holy Feare: two white Doties drew the same, Faire Honesty and snowie Conscience: Her Cart was Care; Wheeles, Hope and Patience. Digression to shew the house of Pouertie. That her, or her sib sider I had seene Vpon a Moore, wonning no neighbour neere, In Cottage poore, and lonesome, I did weene I cleeped [illeg.], bare and thin of geare: For but one Dish, one Table was ther there; One onely Stoole, where each did sit by turne; And Crumocks dung seru'd them with fire to burne. 7 For from her dugs did their whole Market come. A Garden digd to bring an Oaten Cake; One Christall Fount, whose streame as it did run, Seem'd as good Musick, as pure Wine to make. One onely Spade was here, one Sickle, Rake; One onely Knife, one Trencher, and one Pan; In stead of Plate, a Cole-black Ebon Kan. 8 One woodden Spoone, one pretious pewter Salt, One Seaue, for Candles here were neuer seene. And yet if greatnesse had not made her fault, She would haue liu'd content as Ceres Queene: For Silence, Loue, and Peace here borne did seeme, Where Nacke, and Ball, and simple Sim the sonne, At Bed and Board like deare Friends all were one. 9 Securitie set open here the Gate: For those that nothing haue, can nothing feare. Here Peace and Loue close in the corner sat; Content and Silence crown'd with Poppie neere. A dish of Apples was their high dayes cheere: Carussa cold, and Lettuce of light cost, Which entertaine sweet sleepes, and banish Lust. 10 But to returne, Penia onward past Towards Aretes Temple; so did I: When streight there came a troope, whose winged hast Orethrew Penia rudely passing by; For iust they met where two waies crosse did lie, This to the Phane of Arete went on, That vnto Fortune and Argyrion. 11 This Gallant in a loftie Coach was plaste, And Opulence was writ vpon her brest, Her face with quick and sparkling eies were grac't, Smooth was her front, her cheekes with laughter prest, Her members poulpous, and her forehead blest With a proud Coronet, and in her hand She likewise bore the Ensignes of command. 12 Her costly garments did more colours show Then Iunoes foule, or then th' Camelions thought, Or those we see in Iris beauteous Bow; All full of eyes her robes before were wrought Her worldly circumspection to denote: Her obiect Pleasure sat, and on each side As her companions Iocus and Cupid. 13 Vpon her Coach-mans brest I written view Obliuion of God, such was his name. The Horses then that this her Chariot drew, Rapine and Fraude were writ vpon the same, Her Chariot Ease, the Wheeles that it sustaine: Iniustice had and Auarice insculpt, Cruelty and Oppression th' last inculpt. 14 Her Children and Attendants followed last, And some on Coursers brauely mounted were, And some on Palfreys fine and smoothly paest: And Boasting, Curiositie and Feare, Hardnes of Heart, Disdaine, Pride, Children were: Her Tendants, Vaine Delights and Luxuries, Vulgar Applause, Opinions, Flatteries. 15 A thousand Leuits there I did behold; Ten thousand Pleaders each where scatterd lay, And each of these (a wonder to be told) VVith Golden Hammers seemd to paue her way, And as she past, deuoutly did her pray To thinke on them, her Lacqueys to for bread, Faire Maias sonnes knit Garlands for her head. 16 Much troubled was Penia with her VVheele, A little crackt, which while she sought to spell, A bitter iarre betweene them hapt the while: For the poore Wretch i'th' mire no sooner fell, But Opulence extreamely gan to swell Like Dragon fraught with angry poyson showing, And in her head, her eyes, like Aetnae glowing. 17 A thousand bitter tearmes she did bestow On poore Penia, making th'earth resound VVith curses, which from her black mouth did flow: And with her othes did seeme the Heauens to wound; And all this fire did from this fault redound, Because (orethrowne by her) she stopt the way, And seemd her iourney to retard and stay. 18 She calls her twentie times base beggars brat; Nay more, professeth her, her slaue to be, Framde onely for her vse; and worse then that, Accurst by Fate and all her progenie: Then vaunts she her owne birth and fortunes hie, And that her constitution doth surpasse Penia's more, then Dimond common Glasse. 19 And that when first God fram'd this beautious Ball, He gaue her as a blessing most diuine, Both in the earth, in sea, and through them all, Each where with most resplendant beames to shine: And that Penia was not knowne that time, Till Eue by tasting the forbidden tree, Bred her, the curse of her impietie. 20 In humble sort Penia did replie; She was no slaue, but free, with like price bought: And, tho she vaunt not of Nobilitie. If honest, not ignoble to be thought. Beside their pedigree from one Syre brought, One matter and like forme, in like springs mouing, If minds be like, deserues but like approuing. 21 But great impietie thou do'st commit, Thinking my soule (quoth she) like Horses fram'd To beare thy burthens, tis a vessell fit To hold diuine things (and how much lesse stain'd With the worlds dregs more fit) why then is fortune nam'd? Blood, money, earth, as vantage? who haue start In betternes tis in their better part. 22 Touching my Birth, thou err'st no lesse in that; For Adam knew me first in Paradise, While he liu'd naked in his best estate; Rich in the midst of mundaine pouerties. I teach Humilitie vnto the wise, Obedience, and a thousand vertues moe, Had Adam kept me, he had still liu'd so: 23 But lest thou deeme me too contemptiblie, Conceiue it thus. The World's Gods Instrument; The Rich and Poore, Trebles and Bases be; Where from the Base, tho deepest sounds be sent, Yet yeeld the lesser strings much sweete content; And gently toucht, much harmony beget; Much griefe if broke, while to the Base they're set: 24 Oh God (quoth Opulence) thou Catife blind, Seest not that I'me the glory of the day? The beautie of the face, and ioy of mind? Where thou art, each thing languisheth away; The flowre doth fade, and beautie doth decay; A Winter of chill woes nips euery thing, Of ioy or pleasure is there neuer spring. 25 All lawes of friendship do'st thou violate; Through thee the Syre wishes his children dead. The wife repines, the brothers grutch and hate, And oft through thee is sold the Husbands bed. What's more, through thee all mortall men are led Into vile courses: Hence these mischiefes comes, Fraudes, Rapines, Murthers, Thefts, Oppressions. 26 I giue the studeous better meanes to know: Through thee haue perisht many Noble wits: I giue the bounteous better meanes to shew Their vertue, in requiting benefits: But on thy tongue (alas) there onely sits An emptie thankes, through thee are those ingrate, Whose better thoughts would else remunerate. 27 Excepting thee I thinke iust no where is The true Torpedo; whom tho none would find, Yet while they angle for some better fish, They meet with thee, whose hidden force so binds Their members, and so manacles their minds, That streight they seeme transformd to wood &amp; stone, Like those that earst Medusa lookt vpon. 28 And as the Thunder soures the Milke or Wine, So the best humours are by thee quite chang'd Into soure Acide, purest sanguine: But I amongst th' immortall Gods am rang'd By mortall men: for by me griefe's estrang'd, And melancholie banisht from each heart; I mittigate disease, deaths dolerous dart: 29 I powre in men beautie and comlinesse, And with the spright of fortitude them fill. Tis I that doe with Art and Wisdome blesse, Refine the wit, and rectifie the will; Whose parts t'aduance, as thine to ruine still: I raise them from the dunghill, and doe place Them many a time in Fortunes highest grace. 30 Tis I that pierce the center, thence to rend Earths hidden treasures, to adorne the shrines. Tis I that make the Walles, Towres, Spires transcend Aboue the clouds, which vnto after-times, Like faire characters may declare the minds Of those that built them: But with thine remaine Of Wit or Worth, no past or present Fame: 31 It is for me the vtmost Iles are found; For me that Natures closets are made knowne, To make my Courtly Palaces abound With ornaments of Glasse, Silke, Wood and Stone: For me that Neptune doth with burthens grone, Whilest the good Huswiues of each happie State Wed Kingdomes, and their wealthes communicate. 32 With this discourse Penia deepely mou'd, Returnd this speech to Oppulence againe: If what thou sayst by others were opprou'd, Then shouldst thou need no trumpet to proclaime Thine owne worth, but thy selfe, nor mine to staine: But false are thy selfe-praises, and vntrue Thy scandals, notwithstanding their faire shew. 33 Strange Vertues of thy selfe thou wouldst perswade, That by thy meanes, men polisht are with Artes; And that by thee mens minds are thankfull made; By thee endued with loyall louing hearts; By thee made honest; and by thy good parts: Enricht with honour, valour, health and wit, Peace in this life, and heauen succeeding it. 34 A comment faire, if good words could preuaile (Without due circumstance) and bare beliefe: But doubtlesse here thy credit needs must faile; For euident it is thou art the thiefe, That robs mens vnderstandings; Author chiefe Of wanton pleasures; Enemy to these Sweete knowledges, that are not got with ease: 33 How many thankfull persons canst thou show For benefits receiued, that may requite (Hauing got meanes, so often wisht) and doe, If future vse or seruice not inuite? I could name thousands that expecting right And merited reward, at last haue gaind Nought but disgrace, or death, where loue was aim'd. 34 How many youthfull Heyres are to be found, (Altho their Syres haue toyld hard many a day And yeare for them, to adde ground vnto ground, And Coine to Coine) that sit not downe and pray, Great Iupiter to take them soone away? Or Wiues that teares for dying Husbands shed, That wish not pleasures new from wanton bed? 35 No man by thee the honester is made, These qualities vnto the soule adhere Not things. We see the mightie men inuade The weaker, and them grind, deuoure and teare. The poore are curb'd by law, restraind by feare: Presumpteous greatnesse acteth farre more ill, Then impotencie vrg'd by want, not will. 36 Thou mayst affoord an honourable name: But these bare shadowes without substance be, Tis onely vertue that acquires cleare fame: Which he that wants, is like a fruitlesse tree, VVhere nothing else but leaues and blossoms be; Or like an Apple, whose exterior part Perchance seemes faire, but's rotten at the heart. 37 Least needst thou boast of Valour, Health, or Wit; Excesse corrupts the body, dims the mind: A thousand Feauers, Gouts, and Dropsies sit VVayting vpon full platters, and we find An actiue soule but seldome is confind To full fed body, where the mists and showres Of daily surfets, suffocates her powres. 38 As touching peace, thou no such thing do'st giue; The sting for wealth extorted, feare to loose, Anxietie wherein they howerly liue, Still doubtfull where to leaue't, to these, or those; Their soules (like beasts in Toyles) so fast enclose, That both in life and death to earth fast glew'd, They make it doubtfull that no peace ensu'd. 39 Now for my selfe to answer in excuse Thy false obiections, whereby thou wouldst show, That euery mischiefe which the times produce, Proceedes from me, that men dishonest grow Hence onely: I denie that this is so; Then Fortune were a Goddesse: but we see VVealth makes not worth, nor want dishonestie. 40 I no man dull whom Nature did not frame Of courser mould; as spuries I rather serue To prick him on, by vertue to attaine Those Glories, VVisdome, honestie deserue, And valour; and what Fortune doth reserue For her owne children, and to him denie To make him gaine by worth and industrie. 43 Indeed I build no Cities nor proud Towres Of costly things, of Treasures vaunt not I: I liue in humble Cottages and Bowres In peace, except I be disturbde of thee: But thou art cheynd in lou'd captiuitie, Most strongly gyude, and all that take thy part, Not loosely by the legs, but by the heart. 44 No rest at all thou giu'st, of peace no taste, Which not in outward things, but in content And right religion of the soule is plaste. Thy peace beares euery hower some detriment; Each losse of Office, fauour, suit, or rent, Orethrowes it quite; to be in brauerie Out-shind perchance: a frowne makes diuers die. 45 The vanitie of which did whilome moue Those worthy Pagans, most of all to prize That kind of peace, my humble state doth proue; And counting thee the baite of miseries, Despisde thee so, that Aristippus, wise, Threw all thy guyts i'th' sea; who sure did find, That they disturbde his peace, and vext his mind. 46 Xenocrates, and diuers other moe; Diogenes did wholly thee refuse, Because he held thee vnto peace a foe And vertue. And euen God himselfe did chuse My ranke, while he did mortall body vse; So did his friends and seruants, both by word And by example, all my praise record. 47 Scarce had Penia spoke these words of ours. When Oppulence like some great Riuer swolne By Winters tempests, and excessiue shoares, Which beares down Corne and Meadows lately mowne, And mightie Woods, in many ages growne) Flew on Penia, and her passion swelling Ore Reasons bancks) was scarcely held from killing. 48 But halfe her cote there from her back she tore, VVhich she did chalenge to her selfe as due By rights I knew not; and away thence bore, As trophy of the praise to'er conquest due, And with her traine in haste away thence flew So swift, that scarce mine eyes could crackt her pace, Returning streight vnto her natiue place. 49 Long after whom Penia did not stay, But followed speedily to get redresse By some petition, or some other way, VVith weeping cheare, and hearts great pensiuenesse. I longing much to vnderstand no lesse The end, then entrance to this tragedie, To old Eyrema, Artfull VVitch I flie. 50 And her besought out of her powrefull skill, To Oppulentia's Palace me to beare. VVhich granted, vp we flew, more high then hill, Higher then th'ayrie dwellers euer were, From whence great Cities, but small Townes appeare, And Mountaines, Mose hills. Here she made me view Faire Belgia's rich I ownes, and Seeples new. 51 But here she said Penia was not knowne; Yet were she there, the liberalitie And kind compassion should to her be showne. And various waies for fruitfull industrie, VVould change her Nature. But from thence flew we Ouer the vast sea, and the continent Through strange lands, &amp; to Stambolds City went. 52 Neere which she said this Opulentia boad, And had for vse and ostentation raysde Ten thousand stately buildings. Then she show'd When on the sight we thorowly had gazde, Structures indeed deseruing to be praysde, For richnesse, beautie, pleasure; and by Art (Vnseene) conueyde me through each secret part. 53 There did she shew a thousand workes diuine, Wrought in white Paros, and red Porpherie, In Golden Theban, spotted Serpentine Tables and Collumes throwne most curioslie, Whole rooms seel'd through with sable Ibonie, And hung with Clothes, from Niles blest Memphis brought, Or those more faire, by Virgins fingers wrought. 54 Then show'd she me the Beds in-laid with Gold, And some with richer Stones embellished; The Sheets perfum'd with Sweets from Bantham sold, The Flores with costly Carpets ouer-spred, Through which into the Wardrops me she led, Where Silke and Cloth for differing seasons fit, In monstrous shapes, bewray'd her wandring wit. 55 From thence into her Cabbinet she went, And show'd of Ormuz Pearles the costly Chaines, The sparkling Diamonds from Cambaya sent, Set in pure Gold, digg'd from rich Congoes veynes, Which Stella wearing, Iuno's forme reteynes. Then show'd she all her masks, her muffes, her tyres, Ruffes, gartets, scarfes, plumes, lotions, pendants, wires. 56 Which hauing seene without the least offence, Or notice taken of our being there, We next obseru'd her great magnificence, Her state, attendants, and excessiue cheare, Her traines of seruants euer ready neere, With humble reuerence, with cap and knee, And Kookes that still deuising dishes be. 57 Her Cup-boards loaden all with Red and White, And all her vessells wholly of the same, Loaden with dainties, all that may delight; Both Venson, Pheasant, Quaile, and all else tane In Earth and Sea: then Banquets brought from Spaine, The pretious Perfumes that vast Neptune yeelds She shew'd me, and the Sweetes of Indian fields. 58 Why should I heare the daintie Syndon touch, Richly perfum'd, and crispt with cost so trim, That Romes preseruers were not worth so much? Or the Gellies, vnder which with nimble fin, In Muskie waues liue little Fishes swim? Why name I Wines, both Spanish full of fire, Canarie, Creet, French, Hydelberg, and Spyre? 59 Why should I note her Coaches, and Carosses? Her easie Litter, easier Palamkeen? The stately Saddles, curious Bits and Bosses, With Steed: to which the same belonging been; Some of Arabia next to Palestine, Some Freezlanders, some Turquish, some of Spaine, Both Barbaria and Neapolitane? 60 Why note I thousands that their times mispend, Onely deuising pleasures new for her? Those that the Hawkes, or those the Horses tend? Or else the Doggs Troy, Hector, Ringwood, Pirr? Or those by Musick that delight conferr, By toyes, by pastimes, and by flatteries; By songs, by sceanes, by ieasts and tooleries? 61 All these thus briefly noted as we could, Vnseene into the Gardens streight we goe, Where curious Labyrinths we next behold, And Mermaids, fr? whose brests fresh fireames still flow; And Flowres with colours more then Iris Bow; Then Beasts, and Fowles, and Fruits each where she spies Brought from each land t'adorne this Paradice. 62 VVhere Arbors greene of huge streight standing brothers, VVith thick wou'n boughs, keep from the Sunnes cleare rayes; And human eyes, the ioyes of amorous Louers; VVhere farre-fet Quiresters doe sing the praise Of powrefull Venus in their warbling Layes, In vnder-groues, by Art so well design'd, That feet, nor eyes, forbidden passage find. 63 Much more there was, which then we ouerpast, By reason of some noyse raysde at the Gate, To know the cause whereof, we went in hast, And found Penia there in wofull state: For while she here redresse did impetrate, Proud Oppulence tore off the tother piece Of her poore cloake, and left her without fleece. 64 But not content with this, because she sought And su'd redresse, and iustice at her doore, She kickt her downe, treading her vnder-foote; And while Penia mercy did implore, Fierce Oppulentia still incenst the more, And crossing the knowne truthes which she did say, Did what she could to take her life away. 65 But whilest they stroue thus, from a Saffron cloud Came nimble Mercurie with speedy wing, Like Lightning that preuents the clamours loud, But slow reporter of his swift comming, Who brought this message from the Heauenly King; And beckning silence both to great and small, Deliuerd it with wonder of vs all. 66 Mortall (quoth he) from Him, whose powrefull hands Sustaines the fabrick of the Worlds wide Frame; From Him that Thunder and swift Fire commands, Th'etheriall Regions, and the darker Raigne; From Him that vnto beeing calls againe Depriued habits, am I hither sent, T'impart to thee his will and high intent. 67 To thee (quoth he) that seek'st to tyranize Ore poore Penia, making Will seeme Right, And not so much to feede thine auarice, As thy reuenge and proud disdainefull spight; That tak'st her goods, and treadst her vnder-feete, Deeming thy selfe alone in Heauens high grace, And her thy slaue, an abiect poore and base. 68 Fond Mortall, I am sent to let thee know, That thou desceau'st thy selfe, to thinke that Ioue Doth with his Children, as you Mortalls doe, Which shew most bountie still, where most you loue; For he the quite contrarie doth approue: And knowing how abundance spoyles your minds, Content sometimes, for greatest wealth assignes. 69 And know, he sends Penia to the warre Emptie of luggage gainst her mightie foes, For her more safetie; and all theirs that are Found valiant to sustaine these Cannon blowes: For who in warres doe by the luggage goe, Are most part common souldiers? but the braue That are to fight, nought but their Armours haue. 70 His creatures are you both, and both are free, Fram'd for his glory, with one price redeem'd; Both for your states euen equall debtors be, Altho of you much otherwise esteem'd: For Heauens best blessings are by men misdeem'd. But for her wrongs which here thou do'st impose, Heauen writes their weight in euerlasting woes. 71 Know therefore thou deceiuer, that hast lull'd The World asleepe with thine inchanting wiles, And so from her (like Dallilab) hast pull'd Her strength and wisdome by thy cunning guiles, Leauing nought else but shame to her the whiles, Confusion, weakenes, blind securitie, In pamperd pride, and beastly Luxurie. 72 I must denounce that as thou wert exild Long since from stately Babylon, the Queene Of Cities, and from the Chaldean field, VVhere Ceres all her plenties did vnteeme; And from the fruitfull land of Palestine, VVhere nothing now of ancient glory rests; Her soyle turnd sands, inhabitants turnd beasts. 73 So shalt thou for thy wickednes here wrought, Especially for thine oppressions, Because by thee Iustice is bought and sold, And the world tortur'd with thy strange transgressions; Be banisht hence, except the heauenly sessions Preuent the time: but for Penia she Shall to thy wrongs no more now subiect be. 74 A Virgin, and a Royall Queene there is, Beyond the VVesterne Oceans surtliest bound, VVho many a stately kingdome doth possesse, VVhich doth with all things good and faire abound, VVith high felicitie and honour cround; Nothing but one she wants, the chearefull light: For blind she is, and wrapt in clouds of night. 75 Many faire sisters hath she, that obtaine The best of Natures gifts; Hesperia And faire Valencia, proud Iberia's fame, Peloponesus, rich Natolia, Braue Persia, and silken rob'd Media. All which for ample dowries, and rich things, Haue been the Brides of Cæsars and great Kings. 78 For some of these vaunt of their wooll, some silke, Others great portions haue in Corne and VVine; Some of them haue fat Heards, Honny and Milke; Some haue the fruitfull Oliue, some rich Mine; The meanest doth with some faire portion shine: But their wise Parent amply doth requite VVith all their gifts, our Virgins want of sight. 79 The loftie Ceaders of Mount Libanon; The Oylie woods in rocky Norway sold, (VVhere nimble Heards in grounds much fatter run) The Silkes of China, Furres of Russia cold, And VVines of Gascoyne, her faire brests doe hold: The Oyles of Piemont, halfe the Drugs and Dyes, That the whole world containes, in her lap lyes. 80 Vnto this Queene must I Penia beare, VVho with some certaine words which she must say, And with her tongue her darkned eyes must cleare, Which good this Virgin amply will repay; For which let euery faithfull Brittaine pray. This said, the wing'd God snatcht her thence, &amp; vanisht; I wakt, and from my soule all sad thoughts banisht. Malum &amp; finis Rerum: Or, SINNE AND VERTVE. 1 Mine eies are dim, my toung with sorrow cleaueth, My hands they shake, my knees together smite, My soule doth faint, my flesh with horror freezeth, My heart it pantes, my haires they stand vpright, When I in hand doe take my pen to write Tho things which did to me in sleepe appeare, Which needs I must disclose, tho much I feare. 2 When silent Night had couer'd with her cloke The face of Earth, and euery thing sought rest, Saue harmefull beasts, which Nature doth prouoke To prey on weaker things; my Soule opprest With heauy thoughts, which banisht from my brest All pleasing and delightfull fantasies, This Vision thus appear'd before mine eyes. 3 A naked Damsell first appear'd (whose skin With bleeding wounds ennammeld, yet did snow The hidden beauties that had dwelt therein) She fled from one that gaue her many a blow With seuen-fold Whip, whose cause and selues to know Sore did I long, and with that thought opprest, The wronged Wight this speech to me adrest. 4 Mortall (quoth she) I see thou pittiest sore My wrongs; but make the case thine owne, And trust not this false Syren, cunning whore, Who bred in Heauen, &amp; thence to earth thrown downe, As to her prison, here attempts to crowne Herselfe on Earth, since Heauen she cannot win, And robs my name, that's Vertue, but is Sin. 5 Trust not her painted brow, her blandishment; Her beauties but a vizor paisted on, A cunning baite to catch th'improuident; She's vnder it an Ethiopian: And tho she smoothes her wrincles all she can, Shee's filthy, cruell: Tygres farre more kind; They feed on foes, but she deuoures her friend. 6 Vnder her Silke and Purple brauerie, Vnpartiall eyes shall find with perfit sight, Her members spotted with ranck leprosie; Her fingers armed with Harpies clawes for fight And rapine; clouen beast-like both her feete; A Dragons tayle which venombd foynes vncases At her fond louers, in their deare embraces. 7 And tho in pompe she trauell through the world, And most adore her, and her glittring traine; Yet are both they, and she, fear'd and abhord, By those, whose perfect sight desernes the same: Therefore for thine instruction will I name Briefly her equipage, that thou mayst see Both what her selfe and her attendants be. 8 First, must I shew her Chariot and attire, Wherein she makes her progresse with her traine From East to West. The Seate is foule Desire; The Wheeles whereon it moues, are sordid Gaine, Selfe Loue and Vnbeliefe, and Pleasures vaine; Her Coach-man Belzabub, or Abbaddon; Her Mates, Megara, Alecto, Tisiphone. 9 Her Iades that drew her on, Disdaine they be, Pride, Enuy, Wrath, Reuenge, Ambition, And lastly, Feare and Curiositie: Deceite and Lies her Lacqueys by her run, Still ready for all errands. After whom Come her Attendants, Shame and Diffidence, Confusion and tormenting Conscience. 10 Follie's her page, which still keepes Reason tide: Hypocrisie's her Chaplaine, who still thriues, VVhile true Zeale pines. Her Beadles, Ease Lust, Pride, These from her Gates Repentance farre off driues, From whenced Vertue poore these wounds deriue. Lastly, thou seest her brood that followeth, Her Issue, Famine, Sicknes, Warre and Death. 11 This said, foure Altars then she pointed me, All smoking hot with Incence on the same: The first to Ambition and to Crueltie; Ignorance and Idolatrie retaine The second place; the third of these did flame To Auarize and to Oppression: last To Luxurie and Lust the fourth was plac't. [1.] The Altar to Ambition and Crveltie. 12 And while these things she spoke, me thought appear'd A horrid traine of fierce and bloody Wights: Flame colour'd Robes they wore, with Crimson smeard; Their dreadfull lookes euen yet my heart affrights. Quoth she, all these ioy'd once in dismall fights, And to their ends to tract a bloody way, Which thus to sinne her first oblations pay. 13 But to auoide prolixitie (quoth flie) And to make vp a iust account with time, Thy patience and mine owne lost libertie I wish thee note, tis no intent of mine Each seuerall storie here for to designe And prosecute, but onely such as be By chance most obuious vnto mine eie. 14 Why should I point thee out accursed Caine? Orth' Hayrie Hunter with his sinew bow? Or those on whom iust Ioseph did complaine? That frantick faithlesse King why should I show? Or He that made the childrens blood streame through Indeas streetes? whyth' sonne of Gedeon? Or that same comly cruell Absalon? 15 Behold Busiris, Egypts cruell King, That fed with humain flesh his Horses full. Three cruell Ptolomies him following. Numulisinthis then the Thracian Trull: Then Phalleris with's dreadfull brazen Bull. Loe Pontus King, and Occhus false of oath, Black Haniball, and Iugurth here be both. 16 Next these, obserue the Purple Persian there With Royall tyre, Cambiles is his name; How strange a sacrifice the wretch doth beare, To offer cruelties vnhallowed flame. With him Astiages, and Zerxes came; This millions slew, to atcheiue his proud defire; That cookt the children for their wofull Syre. 17 Loe, Tullia, King Seruius gracelesse heyre, Who wearie of her long-liu'd Syres delay, Slew him, perhaps t'anticipate a yeare, Perhaps a moneth, perhaps not a full day: But not consent to take his life away, Most ignominiously she causde her Horse, That drew her Chariot, trample on his corpse: 18 She shew'd me then two Romans and two Greekes, That with their happy regall states displeasde, Halde by Ambition into strange dislikes, Made the world sicke, and in their time diseasde Charen with two much labour, yet appeasde, Nor satisfied a iot their vaine desires, Tho shedding seas of blood to quench those fires. 19 Then (as they came in sight) she did me show Sylla, with purple face and firie eyes, The plague of Pontus, and Romes ouerthrow, By first inducing those sad tragedies. And Marrius fear'd of friends and enemies. Then Caius vile, that wisht the world to slay; And he that slew's Mother Agrippina. 20 Another crew she shew'd me then that seem'd To be some Kingly Romans by their weede, But tyrants were, or monsters righter deem'd, Begot of Tigars broode, or Dragons seede, So many innocents they causde to bleed; Of whom some offerd Armes, some Feet, Legs, thighs, Some Eares, some Noses, others Tongues and eyes. 21 And one of these she show'd me mongst the rest A Romaine Prince (if true my Author tell) Offring a heart with letters fiue imprest, Which Iesus made, if rightly they did spell: But surely in the Tyrants heart was Hell, With dying life, and liuing death who vext Those worthy soules to vertue so conext. 22 Next these came one in Polish weed attir'd, Whom Rats and Mice had bare anatomizde: Then of my faire his story I requir'd, Who said, 'twas one that sometimes Royalizde In Polish Throne; by Poyson that surprizde His Vncles liues, whose flesh by Heauens iust doome Turnd into Rats, the Caitife to consume. 23 Next him came one that sacrifizde to th'Ghost Of's angry Syre, the cruell Amurath: Then he that offerd vp that wofull Host, Of Noble Grecian blood, fierce Mahumeth. Next him Valachia's Prince that put to death So many thousand subiects seuerall waies, As did great Tyrant Mahumet amaze. 24 In the last ranke of these she show'd me more, Three cruell Princes foule with Patricide: A Turke a (misnam'd) Christian, and a Moore. The first, most cruell Selim, full of pride, Who in a cup his ag'd Sires death did hide: Friends, Brothers, Nephews kild, and th'whole world fired, Like Phaeton; and last by fire expired. 25 The second Adolphe, Duke of Guelders hight, Who from his seate his aged Parent drew, And him imprison'd in most lothsome plight, Thinking to tire him out by meanes mis due, Whom into like extreames Heauen iustly threw: And as from's Sire hee banisht pace and rest, So he a captiue liu'd and dyde distrest. 26 The third of these was Ainidas, the Prince Of Tunis, who against his Sire did rise, Tho being chiefly crusted for defence, During his absence, gainst his enemies: Absent he takes his Crowne, present his Eyes. But as his Regall Sire he rob'd of sight, Iust Heauen by sicknesse did himselfe benight. 27 After all these she shew'd me other three, Of whom the first an English habit wore: Wan were his Cheekes, blacke Locks, a downe cast eie, And Camels backe; his name I sought her sore To know, but she denyde, bad aske no more. A thousand slaues there followed after him With bloody bowles where heads and hearts did swim 28 Next after whom a warlike Gaule there came, Which in his hand a bloody brand did waue: The robes he wore were scarlet dyde in graine, And he himselfe like colour seemd to haue, Who in so many millions blood did laue. And as he wet all France with bloody showres, So heauen at length his blood from each part powres 29 The third and last of all, whose natiue ill And vice transcends the vice of all the rest; As farre as Atlas doth the humblest Hill, Or Sylons carry Powre, Galwayes small beast: With whom worst Kings compar'd, seeme good and blest; The Russian Tyrant, Russia's shame, whose breath Did wither all things, in whose name was death. 30 His pleasures were not like to other mens; Sweete sounds the sternest hearts sad'st soules reioyce: But Musick neuer pleasde his hellish sense. He neuer laught but at some dying voyce; Teares, sighs, sobs, grones to him were heauenly ioyes, Who very seldome rellisht well his meate, But when with blood and death he season'd it. 31 If any rauisht virgin did lament, Or honourd Lady forc't vnto his will, Or seem'd their friends or parents discontent, Toth' stewes they went; or (not content to kill) He hung them ore their parents table, till Their friends (with their dead sauour welnigh slaine) By teares and bribes got leaue to burie them. 32 When people from the Temples vsde to come, He vsde to loose his Beares at them in sport, Delighting much to see them scale the throng; With which bad pastime many perisht for't. No mercy did his anger ere consort, Which buried Kindreds; but, encreast to rage, Entomb'd whole Cities, sparing sex nor age. 33 His ministers of mirth, his dearest friends, His Wiues, his Whores, his Children were not sure; The most of these he brought t'vntimely ends; The instruments euen of his lusts impure; The Hangmen from this Hangman's not secure: The Beares and Tygers in their owne Whelpes ioy; He worse then they, his owne Sonne did destroy. 34 The wondrous writing on Balthasnærs wall Seemes small, compar'd with what to him was sent, To whom from Heauen a letter downe did fall In Marble-writ, whose sculpture sure was ment To him that liu'd, and dyde impenitent. And as he fatall was while he had breath, So did his stench in death giue others death. 2. The Altar to Ignorance and Idolatry. 35 These and their ceremonies scarce were past, When in there came another hideous crew, Which to the second Altar went in hast, And on the same their seuerall Incense threw: Most of them differing both in speech, in hue, In face and habit, being seuerall Nations, And some in new, and some in antick fashions. 36 Then here my kind Interpreter I praid T'enstruct me of this second company: Who kindly granted my request, and said, All these brought Incense to Idolatry From euery Coast and Region farre and nigh, Both old and new. But since so many liue, She meant of both but short accounts to giue. 37 She shewd me first vpon this Altar plac't, The Idols worshipt by each seuerall Nation, Whereby Iehouahs worship is defac't, And Stocks and Stones cut after differing fashion, Men, Beasts, Fish, Foule by vaine imagination Are deified; yea, Satan visibly, Not pleasde alone with types inuisibly. 38 She nam'd th'Egyptians, leaders of the rest, Seeking for Isis and Osiris lost, And for their sacred Bull but late disseast, Lamenting sore, meaning to be at cost With's Obsequies: for euen those things that most Harm'd them, they worshipt; th' Aspe, the Dragons fell; Both Birds and Beasts within their Phanes did dwell. 39 Th'Ichuewmon, and the Crocodile they fed, And feeding, with great humblenes ador'd; And Beetles (blinded Beetles they indeed, That so the death of Dogs and Cats deplor'd) (Whose strange zeale that from Onions aide implor'd) Me thought now hauing found Osiris ran, And sacrifiz'd thereto a red hair'd man. 40 The Romans here sought out their rurall Pan, Ioue, Saturne, Hercules, Mars, Liber, Play, Mercury, and two-fronted Linus then; Pallas and Iuno, Venus and Flora, With their blest Mother Berecinthya, Chance, Vesta, Victory, and Priapus, With thousands such, to number friuolus. 41 She showde me then th'old Ethiopians Which Hammon sought, and those oraculous trees; Diana then serued by th'Ephesians, And Eckrons, Baalzebub, God of Flies; Sydmans, busie with the mysteries Of their deare Sheepe god, Asterti Tirians Bowing to Apollo; and to Rimmon th' Syrians. 42 Then those ador'd the Sunne, the fond Phœnicians, Here in great numbers sought their loued stone (So much enricht, and serued by seuerall Nations) Which was Piramed all form'd like a cone. And here the men of Carras made great mone To Luna, to whose Temple those ouercome By their curst wiues, with offrings vsde to run. 43 Next these came such whom amorous fires did moue By paires to seeke the shades, and burbling streames, And sacred beauties of the Daphnean Groue Where Cypresse boughes forbid th'ennamourd beames Of glorious Phœbus, in his hottest gleames To kisse their Mother-earth, or to discouer The secret ioye, of any melting louer, 44 The Persians here ador'd their holy Fire: The Laodiceans to Minerua paide (According as her cruell Rites require) Yeerely oblation of a spotlesse Maide. Diuers there were likewise, that offerings laid To Dagon th'Syren of the Phylistines. But here from these she past to neerer times. 45 And shew'd me first the vaine Tartarians, Offering vnto their felten Deitie, Mares-milke and Flesh. Next them the Chynians, And Iapons, people of great policie, Yet in Religion full of vanitie, And who (as'ts easiest alway to doe euill Through Ignorance) giue worship to the Deuill. 46 Next these came Peguaus as wise as they, That Incenc't Idoll-Deuils of strange shape; As doth Cambaia to, and Bengalæ. The Cidambarans here sought out their Ape, And those of Cothyne, and along to th' Cape Comorin, of Narsinga, Callicut, That bow to an Apes Tooth, and doe worship to't. 47 Then shewd she diuers did Idolatrize Toth, Sunne and Moone, the Moores of Angola, And Congo; some to Serpents, some to Trees. Canibals of Anzitthi, Zanfara, Then show'd she me the Witches of Medra, Which worshipt Deuils, and doe offer them Lou'd sacrifice of humain bodies slaine. 48 She past not byth' tawny Tenustitans, That millions to their Vitzliputzly slew: Seconded by th'as fond Peruuïans, Who did their Virachocha all bedew With blood of slaughtred men. But let me view Brasillians seruing Aignan and's Maracca: Virginians offering theirs Blood and Tobacca. 49 The next that vnto me she did display, Of Turkie pilgrims seemd a Carrouan, Passing the Desarts of Arabia, Who seemd as if to Meccha now they came, Their Prophets graue (and th' house of Abraham) These at this Altar sought mongst other things His Tombe thereon to pay their offerings. 50 Next these came some that brought a world of trash, Beade, Relick; holy Crucifixes, Coffers, Gold, Iewels, Siluer and pure Ciprian brasse, Vowe, Prayers, Teares, to wood and stone, vaine offers To gods that cannot helpe, the wrongs wormes proffers: A dull conceit that sencelesse clogs adores, More grosse then theirs that actiue sprights implores. 51 After all these I fortun'd to espie An Idoll mongst the rest of fearefull forme: Like humain face it had, but ne'er an eie To see: vpon the brow a mightie horne; Elephants eares, yet vse did none returne: An eare-wide mouth, with Boare-like sangs beset, And th' Purples tongue, as sharpe as needles wher. 52 A Ianus face it had, a morions hew, Two wings, and many coloured plumes she wore, The vpper parts did Giants members show, And armes, whose fingers Griffens tallents bore, But Pygmies leggs it had, so small therefore, That much adoe they had to make it stand, For still it tumbled downe on euery hand. 53 Those that did worship this, brought waters sweete, Thinking to wash it faire: but all in vaine, In vaine they stroue to make their Ethiope white, Pure waters were polluted by the same; I crau'd my Faire to let me know their name: But she vnwilling was to grant me this, Onely she calld their Idoll Dokesis. 54 All these past on, amongst them diuers were Whom I had seene, and diuers other to I neuer knew; whom this my Virgin-faire For breuitie omitted me to show: But all with humble reuerence did goe Toth' second Altar, and did lowly lowre, While they thereon did their libations powre. 3. The Altar of Avarice and Opression. 55 Which done, they straight-way vanisht out of sight, And the third ranck appear'd of Suppliants then; All which were such whom Gold did most delight, And gaine atchieu'd byth' harmes of other men. She show'd me diuers Princes mixt with them, Altho for breuitie she onely nam'd Some few, whom this base vulgar vice distayn'd. 56 She show'd me Pharoe and's extorted wealth, Extracted from the poore oppressed Iew: And Lidian Cræsus with his loued pelfe: And Ptolomy whom Cypresse sometime knew: Then the Sicillian Tyrants did she shew, And th' Neapolitane of later time, That causde his subiects for to keepe his Swine. 57 And after them she let me next behold A stately traine of petty Princes then. And Lordings faire attir'd in Silke and Gold, Which saue their Robes did Polish fashion seeme; I should haue sworne I most of them had seene: But I confesse that I no such doe know, And this confession to mine errours owe. 58 With stately pace me thought these Polish Peeres And fierce regard, went vp to sacrifize Chargers of Sweat, and pearly Peasan &amp; Teares, (So oft transformed by Magick Auarice Into those orient ones of smaller price) They offerd shewes of Barke and Ackorne bread, And sculles of men, which hard hearts famished. 59 A thousand Lawyers here did sacrifize. Who offerd vp Demurres, and long delayes, Barres, Stops, Iniunctions, References, And Prohibitions, that the cause betraies Of the poore Client, and the Kernell layes At their owne doores, restoring these the shell, Of whom had Tophet th'ill, the world were well. 60 She showde me then another gowned crew, And Cipresse Garlands did their browes impale; They seem'd like mourners by their sable hew, Yet massie chests they seem'd to tug and hale; Vpon their shoulders bore they bills of sale, Morgages, Nouerints, rich Iewels, Stones; But all their offerings were of dead mens bones. 4. The Altar to Lvst and Lvxvrie. 61 To the last Altar then (whereon were plac't To Bacchus and to Venus Deities, Two Images, with curious cunning grac't) Came the fourth ranck thereto to sacrifize, Which did with Songs and Musick iouialize, And rosie Chaplets did their haires entwine, Their colours youthfull weare, White, Red &amp; Greene. 62 There Babilonian Symiramis She shewed me, and that lustfull Pasipha. The wife of Agamemnon did not misse; Nor youthfull Paris, and faire Hellena; Nor Troyalus, and wanton Cressida, Pirrhus, Lays, Flora, and Manilius She show'd, and Lamye, and Demetrius. 63 Pompeiæ there she show'd, and Clodius; She show'd me Syleus and Messaline. Then Cleopatra and Anthonius, And many others of much later time, And nearer home: all which to Venus shrine, Besides Sighes, Sonnets, Teares, and Libian Gold, Offerd a Milke-white Goat, twice eight yeares old. 64 She noted then three singled from the rest, Whose countenance show'd their sad soules discontent; Louers they seem'd; yet seem'd their minds possest With deeper woes, then Cupids languishment: These three from three pure soules those iewels rent; Which gain'd, with losse of liues they did repay, And Crownes, which here on Venus shrine they lay; 65 Ten thousand more there were, whose stories she For breuitie abridged; yet three or foure She noted, patternes of strange Luxurie, Persians and Chaldeans, but past ore All of them, saue Balthaser, who did powre Full Challices to Bacchus holy Flame, As earst he did amongst his cups being slaine. 66 There named she Getæ th'Emperor, whose meat After no common guise to's table came, But ranckt by letters of the Alphabet. There named she Esope the Tragedian, Who offerd vp a dish vnseene till than, All the sweete singing Birds that Rome did hold, To grace his Feast, at dearest prises sold. 67 She left not out Dennis Heracleot; Iouian, and Septimius Seuerus, Who dyde with drinking, both were not forgot; Nor yet that Sorcerer Tiberius: All which to Bacchus most imperious Did offer Flaggons, and with wreathes of Vine, Adornd the Temples of his honourd shrine. 68 The Priest of Phœbus then she show'd me there, All naked, in his chariot drawne along, By naked women (as he did appeare Sometime in Rome amidst the lustfull throng) Where Gammeds and Syrens sweetely sung) And a rare dish of minst meate offred Of Peæhens tongues, and Cocks-combs finely shred. 69 She show'd me then the Emperour Maximine, A Thracian Shepheard by originall, Who did by all the staires of Fortune climbe Vnto the throne and seate Imperiall.) (But as she raisde him, so the wrought his fall) A full cram'd Glutton so ore fed with cheare, That two strong men were plac't his paunch to beare. 70 Diuers there were of later times, that seem'd Amongst the rest; she noted onely two, The first, at first, great Maximine I deem'd; But better viewd by's picture, streight I know; He softly pac't, but sore did puffe and blow: He dranke to Bacchus, and with all his heart Presented Venus with his secret part. 71 Next him came Muleasses, that perfum'd His dishes with so rare and costly Sweetes, That one three little birds there were consum'd An hundreth Crownes. Next these came diuers Knights And Princely Dames assisting at these Rites, And millions of each ranke, whose stories she Cut off, through th'entrance of new companie. 72 Much was I moued with what I earst had seene, My heart it vented sighes, mine eyes raind teares, Recording things which so long past had been, But now alas renewed my griefes and feares, Seeing a world of Clergie-men by th'eares, Striuing and strugling who should first begin To kill the greatest Hecatombs to sinne. 73 Foule worke they made, and many a bloodie streame Forth from their broken heads did trickle downe: Sore tugged they at a triple Diademe, And for the same was many a clouen crowne, Their Croysiers crackt and Miters ouerthrowne: Such stirre there was, as any man might well Thinke onely bred in Babylon or Hell. 74 In most disordred sort along they went, Amongst themselues each striuing first to be. With single sacrifizes not content, Each of them did to euery Altar flie With equall zeale, and like Humilitie; Out-stripping farre (if all she told me true) The vildest Pagans either old or new. 75 Then quoth my Faire, Conuert then thine eyes, and find In these the compleate ill of all the rest, And vice accomplisht in so high a kind, That Nero here would Crueltie detest, Maximine thinke his Auarice were blest, Mad Anthonine would Luxurie deride, Messalme would hate lust, Poppea pride. 76 Loe first comes he that drew the putrid Corse Of's predecessor from his Marble Vrne, And in a Synode (voyde of all remorse) First, plac't him in Saint Peters Chaire in scorne, Did him with Robes pontificall adorne; Degrades him; then from's hands three fingers cuts; Lastly, with's corpse pure Tyburs waues polutes. Platina, de formoso in vita Stephani sexti. 77 Then Iohn the twelfth, a monster vile behold, To hunting more adicted then to prayer (When tend it for venerian tilts he could:) The Lateran he made a brothell faire; Saint Peters golden Challices the ware. He, Healths to Pluto drunke; and for his paine, By him i'th'act of lust impure was slaine. 78 I would not load thy memorie too sore, (Quoth she) mongst many will I name but two Damd Sorcerers, that Leagues accursed swore, And did in woods and secret places bow, And sacrifice th'infernal powres vnto, Contracting most deare bargains, to obtaine A short, disquiet, aye repented raigne. 79 The first loe there is Siluester by name, Whose bargaine was, that he on earth should stay So long, till to Ierusalem he came, A further iourney then he meant to stray. But going to the Church, so call'd, to pray, His Feinds appeares: the Churches name he craues: Which knowne, he droopes dies. Thus false Feinds deceiues. 80 That other Benedict the ninth we call, So farre indeed from what his name imports, That to obtaine the cursed Romain Pall, And that with women he might freely sport, Sealed couenants written with his owne blood for't. And whilest he once his wicked homage made, His Master kild him, and his owne debts paid. 81 There goes another no lesse liberall, Another Benedict, a blessed one: Of Priestly gifts and grace spirituall, A man of equall note with those best knowne, Who rauisht Nuns and Virgins, pittied none: A damned Atheist blind with lust and pride, The soule to be immortall he denide. 82 That Hildebrand loe here, that Hellish brand, The sower of sedition, murther, strife, Before whose Gate an Emperour did stand Barefoote three dayes, attending with his wife; Yet still he sought to rid him of his life: Not pleasde, altho his Crowne vpon his knee He offerd him, with base seruilitie. 83 Then show'd she him that did Pope Iohn benight, Imprisond, and in prison causde him pine. Then he that crown'd the Emperour with his feete, That dogged in cælestiall Cælestine. Then Alexander Pope farre lesse diuine Then Pagan Alexander, Persia's god, Who vnder's feete Great Cæsars neuer trod. 84 Next these, a Wretch that murtherd two Popes goes Calixtus then that Gregorie displac't, Making him passe in manner dolerous Through Rome, where earst he had been highly grac't; Vpon a Cammell leane, and badly pac't, Trapt with raw Goats hides, then to prisne confind him, Where with Petrean charitie he pyn'd him. 85 Loe Balthasar that Balthasar excell'd, Poysoning his Predecessor, to acquire Saint Peters Chaire; who th'holy Relicks sell'd, To feed the fewell of his Paphian fire; For rapes of Nunnes, and fortie vertues higher, And Atheisme, was at Constance last deposde, And in strong Manheyms walles he dyde enclosde. 86 Next him obserue Aeneas Siluius, That made old Rome a new stage of delight; Learned, but subtill and luxurious. Next whom comes Peter Barbo into sight, Whose soule liu'd here in a Cimmerian night. And (tho his rich stones dimd the Moone) dy'd poore, Consuming all on's Bastard and his Whore. 87 There others goe, whom lust and beautie hent To highest place. Then Sixtus loe (quoth she) That Brothels built t'encrease Saint Peters rent, And with his friends dispenc't for Sodomie Three moneths the yeere, Iune, August, Iuly: And he that sometime did Auignion feast Most prodigally, yet but one dish drest. 88 Then Borgia behold well-nigh the last, Whose auarice I doe not meane to touch, (Slight vice for vertues oft-times here hath past) But diuelish Artes and lust in him were such, That to corriue with sonnes, he thought not much In's daughters bed: so mixt he many a cup Of death for's friends, and last himselfe did sup. 89 Then after these she let me see that Iulius, That Peters Keyes in Tyburs waues did throw; And Pauls keene Sword then tooke in hand most furious, When he before Mirandula did go; VVherewith he made whole streames of blood to flow. Then Leo last, an Atheist worst of all VVho did the Gospell but a Fable call. 90 These Clergie men brought vessels full of bloud, And poisoned bowles, they offerd crueltie: Then Teeth, Bones, Haire, old Reliques, rotten VVood, And Idols more then Nile to Idolatrie. To Auarice a world of soules. To Luxurie, Delitious Cates, VVine, Silke and costly Stones. To Venus then, ten thousand little ones. 91 Here-with me thought the Altars fiercely blaz'd, The flames then earst ascended much more high, The smoke ten thousand pitchy turrets raisde, And so transcended boue the Starry skie, Piercing the nostrils of Ioues Maiestie: VVhereat amazde, my haires vpright they run, Mine eyes grew dim, and tongue grew stiffe and dumb. 92 For straight me thought the earth began to quake, The water murmurd, and the ayre did sigh, The leauy Groues seem'd sadder sounds to make The Oxen groned, and Horses snorted high: All rebels to their Masters, feeling nigh This end of things; and all in heart request Great God to right their wronges, and giue th? rest: 93 The Sun and Moone then streight me thought grew dim, The Starres from heauen they fell, and lost their light; And all the world seemd now returnd againe To her first Chaos, and eternall night. Then were my feares and hopes, in doubtfull fight, When straight me thought this voice came fr? aboue; Is this the fruit of Heauens long care and loue? 94 The Earth cries out, that man her gifts abuseth. The Sea (whose bending backe he tyres for gaine) That bloody streames he in her waues infuseth, And doth corrupt her spawne with bodies slaine. The Aire that it's polluted doth complaine. The Fire cries out, he doth so oft enrage it, That Cities melt, and Floods can not asswage it. 95 The Towre-bearer, and proud couragious beast Crie out, he forceth them against their will, T'assaile with armed sides, and barbest crest The liues of men to murther and to kill. The Lions rore, that earst were taught to fill Themselues on Men; whom hunger only forceth To feed on those, Ioues fatall brand endorceth. 96 The weeping Woods of haplesse Arabye, The sweetes which for delight and health he fram'd, Euen these complaine, and doe for vengeance cry, Because so oft on Idoll shrines they flam'd, And by his lusts impure haue been defam'd. The powrefull Hearbs, which flying breath recall, Made by themselues Deaths Agents in their fall. 97 The Beasts, Fowle, Fish and Fruit of various kind, Ordain'd for health, for pleasure, and for vse, The hidden treasures to the earth assign'd; All these likewise doe witnesse his abuse, With which he truth and iustice doth traduce: With which he surfets, while his brethren pine, And in his heart denies the powre diuine. 98 The Saints lament that Heauen he still reprocheth, The Angels grieue at his ingratitude. The Deuils cry out, that he on them encroeheth, And now begins to teach them to be leaud: Therefore Iehouah doth in Time conclude, Since all's accomplisht, was decreed before, The World shall end, and Time shall be no more. 99 Here-with the fires th'etheriall tracts retaines The hidden sparkles, both in Wood and Stone, The Sulphur lurking in earths secret veynes Burst forth (me thought) and all conueend in one, Men, Beasts, Trees, Houses for to feede vpon: This fierie Sergeant in an houre did spoyle Of many hundred yeares the painefull toile. 100 Then gaspt earths marble iawes; her hungry mouth It opned wide, tho now no more to take, But to restore the surfets of her youth: Each Goale a free deliuerance to make; The Sea restorde her Dead, each Streame and Lake, And all the earth with new-borne limbs it trembled, VVhile soules and bodies themselues re-assembled. 101 The Kings and Princes they did sore lament, VVishing the earth would ope and swallow them. The gallant Dames that liu'd incontinent, For whose deare sakes so many earst was slaine, VVith horror here confounded, and with shame; They wayled, they wept, they wisht to change their state VVith meanest slaues, or beasts they fed on late. 102 But all in vaine they wisht what cannot be: The Trumpet sounds, and they must all appeare: They see the angry Iudge sitting on high; Beneath them Hell, the obiect of their feare: No pleaders need they, neither witnesse here, Three Bookes of Conscience, Passion, Life lies ope, Then cease the good to feare, the bad to hope. 103 The sentence past, the blessed soules reioyce: The wicked gnasht their teeth, gainst Heauen blaspheming; The Deuils howld, and made a fearefull noyse, And all the poyson of their malice teeming On wretched mortalls (hopelesse of redeeming) In burning carrs, &amp; chaines towards Hell them hayld, Fr? wh?ce, me thought, these words mine eares assaild. Vox gehenna. Oh cursed you, that whyleft yee earst had time, No councels betterd, nor examples moued, To keepe the statutes, and the lawes diuine, But still your blinded sence your banes approued; Tho Christ for sinners suffred whom he loued: We but for one offence are hither driuen, You're lost for want of faith, whose sins were giuen. 105 VVith flaming forkes therefore weele tosse and turne yee, In Stigian streames to Christall will we freeze yee; In Phlegiton then will we thaw, then burne yee; Our comfort is, we're sure we cannot leese yee. Death grazeth on yee, but he euer flies yee. Here shall ye freeze with feare, &amp; burne with anguish, And pine with famine, and in darke fires languish. 106 You Tygers which did thirst for bloody streames, And teares of others, here shall drinke your owne. You Moles, whose eyes were dazde with Golden beames, Yee shall haue store, great measure shall be showne, With Ladles downe your throtes it shall be throwne. You Iustfull Goats, that ioyd in amorous graces, You shall be glutted here with our embraces. 107 You angry Doggs, here shall you fight your fill. You rauenous Wolues, here shall ye eate your dung. You enuious Dragons to, that dyde to kill, That hated still the good, the wise and strong, Your selues vnapt for any thing but wrong, Here shall ye feed on Aspecks; and your head With Snakie tresses shall be couerd. Pœna sensus. You Eyes that heretofore could not endure To looke vpon the sores of Lazarus, But highly feasted were with things impure, With costly Pictures, and lasciuious, With Gownes, with Gauds, with fashions rare and vicious, With Maskes, with Shows; here shall ye nothing see But Serpents, flying Fires, and vgly We. 109 You, you whose noses still so close were pent, In passing by the poore and needy wight, For whom from Ganges Odours rich were sent, And nothing was thought costly, that was meet, To couer Natures faults, or to delight. You, you that Chimneys were for Indian smoke, With pitchy Clouds and Brimstone shall yee choke. 110 You eares that earst were deafe vnto the poore, Whom flatteries, or gaine, or charming sound Of Musick only pleasde, you shall no more Heare names of Honor, Grace, of Wit profound, Valour or Beautie; here all things resound, And eccho horror, grones of wretched Ghosts, Othes, Blasphemies, and Yells of vs your Hosts. 111 You, you for whom the Virgins fingers spunne The silkes of Naples, and proud Genoa, For whom were brought soft Sables from the Donne, And costly Ermines from Rhezania; Who pin'd the poore that you might feast and play. You, you whose curious touch no Downe could please. Here burning beds of Iron is your ease. 112 You curious mouthes that nought but sweets could taste, Whose great excesse did grutch the poore a share, Which on your paunches millions earst did wast, And had so many thousands still to care, Onely to bring you dishes, strange and rare, Here Ostrich-like shall swallow in your rage, Toads, Steele, or Stones, your hungers to asswage. Pœna damni. Then damned soules, conceiue what you haue lost, How faire a Citie, what a Mansion, Prouided for yee at anothers cost; Enricht with beauty and perfection, Where thorny cares, disease, or want is none, But all with glorie, and with wisdome shine, Sustain'd and cherisht by that loue diuine. 114 On earth while earst you liu'd, you deemd the losse Of Parents fauour was no little paine; The losse of Kingdomes an exceeding crosse; But most to loose the light, and to remaine In dungeon darke: This losse doth all containe The losse of God, whose boundlesse powre diuine Doth not your plagues in times or tearmes confine. 115 Altho ye could like Esau melt to teares; Restore like Iudas your accursed gaine; Like Ahab mourne in sack-cloth (many yeares) Altho you here could chatter like the Crane, Send forth as shrill shrikes as the Pellican: Tho ye could weepe whole Seas for euery sinne, They're all but lost, no mercy can yee winne. 116 But here me thought I felt a sudden ioy Run through my flesh, and wing my rauisht spright, Feeling my selfe exempt from this anoy, Full of cœlestiall thoughts, and rare delight, Amongst the Quires of heauenly Singers sweete. With which high ioyes, I thinke, my soule had scapt From forth her prison, if I had not wakt.</field>
