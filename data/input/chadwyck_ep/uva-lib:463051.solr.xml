      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Robert Deverevx Earle of Essex and Eire, Vicount of Hereford, Lord Ferrer of Chartley, Borcher and Louaine, Master of the Queenes Maiesties horse, Knight of the noble order of the garter, and one of hir Maiesties honorable priuie Counsell: Thomas Churchyard nisheth increase of all wished honor, happines of life, worlds good will, and euerlasting fame. AN EVERLASTING MEMORIE OF CHRISTIAN comfort to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie. O grashous dame, in whose graue iudgment great The heauens hie, lies open plaine to sight The earth belowe, takes from thy regall seat (In darkest daies) his hope and cleerest light. For at thy feet, a world of woorthies fall Elizabeth, a monarke to them all. An Empresse heere, three kingdoms showes vs plaine On which three realms, our Queen may rightly raine. O treble Queen, the sweete and highest part That we like best, and shrillest voice doth sound The onely meane, to shew deepe musicks art Where all the skill; of well set song is found. Grant silly man, a grace that meanes to sing Of heaunly loue, and of none other thing. He sings of peace, a song should lull asleepe The fellest feends, and fearfull bugs below Peace charms with words, the wolfe that wearies sheep That neither lambe, nor kid astraie shall goe. For as the hen, hir chickens keepes from kite So charitie, doth saue hir children all From common plagues, and wicked worlds despite And all the wrath, that from the clouds can fall. She spreds hir wings, to keepe hir birds from cold And learns poore chicks, to picke vp graines of gold. This charitie, so checkles ore hir broode She scrapes the earth, to make hir yoong ones feed And freely from, hir selfe doth spare them foode She takes in hart, such care for those that neede. If charitie, were not the onely nurse To nourish vp, each thing that life doth beare This backward world, would grow from ill to woorse And brutish folke, would banish loue and feare. Warme Christian loue, as long as life doth last Doth bide the shocke, and brunt of eurie blast. And kindled once, in any princely hart It burnes and flames, as hot as Æthna hill Creepes throw the vains, and nerues in euerie part Cannot be quencht, with water, wit nor skill. A heaunly grace, maintains a heaunly loue Each thing diuine, diuinely is set foorth Planted like rocke, that nothing may remoue Garnisht like gold, or perle of greatest woorth. The charitie, I meane is garded so And for hir faith, through fire and aire may goe. But what is that, to him that sings a song Of twenty parts, when he one voice must sound Presumes to tell, a tale perchance too long To sacred eares, whose iudgement is profound Sing hie or lowe, how ere the tune he takes For one smalliar, the song begins againe No shift may serue, for concord musicke makes Most harmonie, consists in pricksong plaine. Diuision doth, but teare in peeces small The minnems long, and little crotchets all. Full softly blowes, a quiet calmie winde A still milde voice, doth please the hearers well No note nor ring, so much contents the mind As solemne sound, of cleere sweet siluer bell. O that my muse, might get so great a grace As credit win, throw any sound it shoes I die to see, one fearfull frowne of face VVhere these meeke words, and humble verses goes. Now mirthles song, begin thy new found note As strange a straine, as any eare hath hard If world would learne, to sing the same by rote Good charitie, should grow in more regard. Play well thy part, so shall the greatest smile And meanest sort, of force be pleasd the while. Your Maiesties most humble seruant, Thomas Churchyard. [VVhat song should please, a sacred princes eares] VVhat song should please, a sacred princes eares Which likes no tunes, but musick sweet &amp; sound Weake were my muse, to offer sighes and teares Where ioyfull mirth, and gladnes doth abound But troubled mind, that rowles on restles ground In sorrow sings, the secrets of the hart Because sad man, can sing no sweeter part. O charitie helpe. Of charitie, that makes a solemne noies A strange consort, I hope well tunde I bring Of heauenlie loue, that passeth earthlie Ioies In formall wise, a true set song I sing Would God the sound, through al the world might ring That charitie, which ech one ought to keepe Might waken now, that long hath laine a sleepe. O charitie helpe. Shee hath bin brought, in slumber sundrie waies With lullabie, as nurse doth rocke hir childe The cradle gaie, of pleasant nights and daies With too much ease, hath charitie beguilde And now God wot, the world is waxt so wilde That charitie, must needs make ech thing tame That wilde discord, hath brought cleane out of frame. O charitie helpe. Pity and ruth, are fled or banisht quite And in their place, comes rigor rudelie cled Godlie remorse, is drownd in worlds delite Good conshence feares, that charitie is dead Loue looketh downe, and hate holds vp the head Troth barelie liues, and tretchrie thriues apace Deserts doth starue, and meanewell hides his face. O charitie helpe. Franknes is blinde, affection dims his sight Larges is lost, hardnes supplies his place Wrong runs so swift, it ouer-gallops right Goodnes limps downe, and halts in many a case Do well doth droupe, or walks with muffled face Vertue and vice, now wrastles for a fall And so the strong, will thrust the weake to wall. O charitie helpe. Stoutnes with strength, strikes flat the feeble force Downe is kept downe, and neuer like to rise Malice and might, rides both vpon one horse (Sir Packolets nagge, that gallops through the skies) Iudgement growes grosse, ore weening wanteth eies Will is a wagge, waste hath the wager woon For all the date, of our redresse is done. O charitie helpe. Loyaltie weeps, and flattrie laughes and smiles Goodwill is scornd, and puts vp many a taunt Pouertie is plagude, or ouermatcht with wiles Plainnes complaines, but pride bids him auaunt Crueltie the curre, with crie of hounds will chaunt But bandog bites, full sore before he barke And craft the carle, still iuggles in the darke. O charitie helpe. Friendship lookes pale, it hath an ague fit Fauour is faint, and lame it cannot go Finenes is false, and full of subtill wit Faith giues faire words, and breaketh promis so Constancie reeles, and staggers to and fro Charitie must needs, reforme these follies strange That by abuse, doth noble nature change. O charitie helpe. Dutie doth die, to driue on diuelish drifts Stubbornes striues, to wrangle for a strawe Cunning long liues, by cusnage and by shifts Disorder thriues, with neither rule nor lawe People growes proud, without true feare or awe If suffrance see, these prancks and hold his peace Goodnes decaies, and badnes shall encrease. O charitie helpe. If charitie be, the foode or fruite of faith Where bloomes that tree, where doth those branches bud True charitie sure, as wisest people saith Is working still, and euer dooing good Loue helpes our health, as life maintaines the blood But where no helpe, nor succour we may finde There charitie, is almost out of minde. O charitie helpe. If through my faith, great mountaines I may moue And can raise vp, to life the dead from graue That withred faith, brings foorth no fruite of loue It gaines no grace, what euer hope I haue If charitie be, the thing which good men craue God graunt that I, and all that heares the same May sing that song, like Sidrack in the flame. O charitie helpe. My humble hart, hopes now but for dispatch Of life that wastes, away like candle blase The clocke will stricke, in haste I heare the watch That sounds the bell, whereon the people gase My forces faile, my wits are in a mase My corps consumes, my skin and bones doth shew The soule is glad, the bodie hence shall go. O charitie helpe. Truth waited long, on your sweete sacred raigne To catch some crums, that from your table fals I sowe in teares, and reaps but bitter paine That makes sicke soule, lie groning by the wals Where hands a crosse, for helpe to heauen cals So sucks vp sighes, and sorrow of the minde As boyling brest, blowes fast for aire and winde. O charitie helpe. My muse doth muse, how labour lost his time And seruice great, doth get so small regarde I neuer thriude, by prose nor pleasant rime Nor could in world, be any way prefard An open signe, my thankles hap is hard Yet numbers of, my verie name and race By prince in court, were cald to woorthie place. O charitie helpe. I am the Drone, that bees beats from the hiue The vglie Oule, that kites and crowes do hate The drawing oxe, that clounes do daily driue The haples hinde, that hath the hatefull fate (That weares all sutes, and seasons out of date) If destny so, alots men such hard chance They passe the pikes, that fortune will aduance. O charitie helpe. My passage is, like one that rides in post Through water, fire, and all the hazards heere And so draws home, a weary grisly ghost Whose losse of youth, buies loathsome age too deere Now coms account, of daies, of houres and yeere My debts are stald, as oft bare bankrouts be The graue paies all, and sets my bondage free. O charitie helpe. The wo of wars, and pride and pompe of peace The toile of world, and troubles here and there And churlish checks, of fortune I release Their heauie crosse, I can no longer beare In peeces small, my scribbled scrowles I teare So flinging verse, and bookes before your feet I craue some crownes, to bie my shrouding sheet. O charitie helpe. All hope is gone, of any earthly hap The axe is come, to giue the falling blow Downe flies the bowes, the tree hath lost his sap Vp to the clouds, like smoke the breath shall go A sillie puffe, of winde ends all this wo O grashous Queene, then some compassion take Before my soule, this combrous caue forsake. O charitie helpe. If nothing come, of seruice, sute and troth True man must trudge, and leaue his natiue soile Abroad the world, to see how fortune goth In any place, where faith is free from foyle Heere with vaine hope, my selfe and life I spoile First lost my youth, so time and all is gone Age sindes no friends, nor helpe of any one. O charitie helpe. Of charitie, a great discourse is made Vnto an Earle, I honor in this land It is not hid, nor sits in silent shade Would God it were, in your faire blessed hand There lies the notes, as thicke as is the sand And there I sing, three parts in one at lest And in sweete sound, true musicke is exprest. O charitie helpe, or else adue the pen For I must march, againe with marshall men. FINIS. To the generall Readers. I fought amisse, you finde good Reader heere, His fault it is, that sings ne sweete nor loud: When he caught cold, and voice could not be cleere, Because ech note, is cloked vnder cloud, He craud no helpe, nor stole from no mans song, One peece nor part, of musicke any waie: Ne sembreeffe, breefe, nor yet ne larke nor long, For he hath skill, in deskant some men saie, And on the base, can make three parts in one, And set new songs, when all the old are gone. Though some beleeue, but hardly that he makes, These things or that, which seemes far past his reach, Tush though old head, and hand with paulsie shakes, Let no ill will, plaine writers pen appeach: If you do loue, no wrong giue ech man right: Rob not the iust, of any praise well won, Way not mens worth, with waights in ballance light, For truth is truth, when all is saide and don: You may as well, say white and red is blacke, And Sun and Moone, are steele and marble stone: As say or thinke, behinde a writers backe. He borrowed that, which he claimes as his owne: O giue men leaue, to father their owne childe: Let it be foule, or faire as babies are, A stubborne boye, a cracke-rope tame or wilde, Begot in haste, and brought vp poore and bare: How ere they be, blinde, lame, or shapt awrie, Vglie to sight, bigge, boulchons lowe or hie, Those yoonglings all, the Dad can not denie, Are his that sent, those babes abroad to nurse, (Like orphants weake, that knowes not what to do) With blessings great, and not with parents curse, That shortens life, and gets Gods anger to: Children were woont, to beare their fathers name, Not one durst say, in earnest iest or skorne, (To hinder childe, of spotlesse birth and fame) A lawfull sonne, was but a bastard borne. Both beast and bird, their yoong ones do defend, So shall my Muse, maintaine that I haue pend, Then bring Shores wife, in question now no more, I set hir foorth, in colours as she goes, Sir Rafe Bowser a worshipfull knight witnesseth where and when I penned that. And as she went, like gallant lasse before, So other gyrls, as gaie and fresh as rose, With verse haue I, set foorth in sundrie sorts, As braue as she, what ere disdaine reports, That humor now, declines for age drawes on, The full tide is, of fine inuention gon: Ebbe followes floud, when vitall vaines waxe dead, Wit weares and wastes, as torch consumes with winde, When water turnes, drie growes a flowing head: In age ech thing, decaies by course of kinde: Yet whiles the oyle, in lampe may make a blaze, Or candell in, the socket shewes a light, On sparkling flame, the cleerest eies will gaze, And comfort finde, thereby in darkest night: I yeeld to time, that like a sit be cuts cleane, All that doth grow, in spring or fall of leafe, And wish in world, my treble were a meane, That I might sing, to eares that are not deafe, A note should sinke, as deepe in iugging brest, As euer yet, in sea did ancker rest: Songs are but like, as fancies giues them leaue, Both well and ill, as sounds of trumpets are, Though Syrens voice, the hearers doth deceaue, Mine hath no charme, but open plaine and bare, As I was borne, so speake I English still, To lose my paines, and win the worlds good will, No losse so much, as credit crackt with pen, Nor gaine so great, as loue of honest men. Fare you well. The Author to his booke. Go now plaine booke, where thou maist welcom find, Walke throw the world, till frinds do thee embrace: Let foes alone, obay thy masters mind, For fear nor threat, hide not a fautlesse face. Win courts good will, the countries loue is gaind, With wise men stay, from froward wits beware: At plow and cart, plaine speech is not disdaind: Sit downe with those, that feeds on hungrie fare, For they haue time, to note what thou dost saie, Let gallants go, they will but giue a gibe: Or take thee vp, and fling thee straight awaie, Touch not smooth hands, that vse to take a bribe, They better like, full bags than busie bookes, Shun from the sight, of glorious peacocks proud: Their onlie pomp, stands all on statelie lookes, They glowm and skoull, as tweare a raynie cloud. Giue babling toongs, good leaue to taunt and talke, Their taste is gone, they oft take chese for chalke. Bid scornfull heads, let true-plaint lines alone, That harmles are, and came from lowlie hart: Passe not in haste, to people strange vnknowne, Least iudgment swift, do take on thee the start. And run beyond, thy reach full many a skore, Go slowlie foorth, with thanks come quickly howe: Bring no rebuke, for that nips near and sore, Twere better far, abroad thou shouldst not rome. Though thou be blind, yet those that well can see, If thou offend, will find great fault with mee. Behaue thy selfe, as mildly as thou maist, Like messenger, that doth his armd aright: Thy master must, affirme each thing thou saist. The darkest word, at length must come to light, Like pilgrim go, and passe throw perils all, Take well in worth, what hap doth thee befall. Returne no more, to me till newes thou bring, Of praise or thankes, or of some better thing: If none of these, this waiward world will yeeld, Trudge from fine towne, flie to the open feild, Where thou must passe, through thickets full of thorns, Where pricking briers, and croked brambles grose: And neuer none, scapt free from scrath or scornes, Or scratted hands, or tearing of his close. Where eluish apes, and marmsets mockes and mose, And thistles are, seen sooner than a rose. Yea thou shalt come, where nettles are good store, Whose angrie sting, will blisters raise apace, Slip from those weedes, and come near them no more: For fear vnwares, good words do get disgrace. The goodlie floures, of court thou needs not feare, For they are sweete, and meeke of nature throw, There wisedome will, with writers humor beare: If humbly stil, thou canst behaue thee now, Thy masters pen, hath purchast fauour there, Among the Dames, of faire Dianas traine, Where beautie shines, like siluer drops of raine. In sunnie day: O booke thou happy art If with those Nimphes, thou maist be entertaind, If any one, of them take in good part, A verse or word, thou hast a garland gaind, Of glorie great, for fame hir selfe must sound, Out of their voice, looke what they do pronounce: Like tennis ball, aloft it doth rebound, And yeelds great weight, but not by dram nor ounce, But heauie as, a massie pound of lead, They wey mens worth, with praises quicke or dead. Yea what they say, of Poets fond or wise, Of prose or verse, that ripe inuenshon shoes: As twere a lawe, the fame there of shall rise, And through the world, like coin it currant goes. From hand to hand, and so doth passage take, Preasse thou to them, for they may mend my hap: If that of thee, some good account they make, And that in sport, they laie thee in their lap, Vntill they list, to read thee eurie line, Then at welhead, some water drawe I may: For fountaine springs, may run cleere claret wine, Whose pleasant sap, giues moisture eurie way. The nimble Nimphs, that with Diana dwell, Can quicklie turne, the cock and flowing spout: That thousands shall, bring buckets to the well And watch their times, till comfort commeth out. Now booke trudge hence, bestow thy labour right Set spurs to horse, that flies in aeir with wings Mount ore the hils, and rest ne day nor night Till thou do come, before great Queens and Kings Then flat on face, fall prostrate at their feet That may from graue, call vp thy masters spreet Keepe thou these rules, this course and compasse hold So may thy grace, conuert my lead to gold. CHVRCHYARDES CHARITIE. When labring minde, and weary body both Is cloid with world, &amp; hart wold shake off toile Before the ghost, to highest heauens goeth And death of life, shall make a wretched spoile A well disposed name, cals many good things to memorie. (And man must needs, forsake this loathsome soile) He takes some care, to make his conshence cleere Of all he thinks, or may imagine heere. First lookes he vp, where soule desires to be Good men haue many sweet imaginations. Of life to come, to know what hope we haue And where we rest, in ioie from bondage free So soone as cold, dead bodie lies in graue Than ere man leaues, this cruell cumbrous caue In charitie, he waies this world aright As far as wades, wise iudgement, skill and sight. But finding world, full fraught with fond desires Blinde world is fraught with fond desires. (A mightie masse, of matter therein lies) That burns out time, and kindleth many fires Whereon foule flames, and smothring smoke doth rise, He lookes thereon, with heauie rufull eies, As though some zeale, might mooue a musing minde To pity plagues, that man must leaue behinde. The poore estate of people is to be pitied.Who doth not sigh, to see the poore opprest By rich mens reach, that wrests awry the right Who will not waile, the woe of troubled brest Or sore lament, the state of wronged wight When broad day brings, darke dealings vnto light Who will not rue, our wretched race on earth That keepes till death, no rule from day of birth. The wealth hardly won is easilie lost.The goods we win, are woorse to keepe than get The wealth we lose, robs some of rest and sleepe Our daily gaine, will answere scarce our det We couet more, than wit can warely keepe We slip from hence, as rich as new shorne sheepe And that we leaue, in world that well was won Is soone consumde, and spent with riotous son. Who parts from world, would wish that were not so Graceles time runs on rowling wheeles.His charitie, commands him so to thinke But graceles time, on rowling wheeles doth go At whose abuse, our flyring world can winke Vice cares no whit, if vertue swim or sinke Ambishous mind, and malice meetes in one So that true loue, and charitie is gone. Loue bids men looke, to all things vnder Sun Christian loue lookes to euerie thing.Beast fish, and foule, and all we see with eie But charitie, a greater course doth run Because it doth, in quiet conscience lie She lookes ech where, as she had wings to flie And houer ore, our doings on this mould That bridle takes, and will not be contrould. O then to loue, and charitie I pas Whose zeale is great, and charge is nothing small Zeale is the glas that shewes the spots of face. That cleerely sees, (as in a christall glas) The spots of face, and inward cankers all And can in haste, vnto remembrance call Old farn yeers past, and present things of late, Whereof a world, of wits may well debate. Who can hold toong, to see bad worlds abuce Abuse runs ouer the brim. Run ore the brim, where vertue neuer floes As hauocke had, hald vp the water sluce Where out at large, great skuls of fishes goes Poore pashence must, be pleasd with painted shoes Alms deeds are dead, no pitty now is laft For all the world, is set on sleight and craft. If pouertie, be pincht with plague or sore He starues for food, adue the man is dead The sound we seeke, the sicke we do abore Full paunch eats all, the hungrie is not fed Full paunch eats vp all. For greedy guts, keeps needy mouth from bred True charitie, and good deuoshon old By frost and snow, are almost kild with cold. Would God good works, with faithfull honest deeds Reformd this vice, that spreds too far I feare And faire sweete flowrs, were planted for those weeds Faire wordes make fooles fame. That doth with fraud, infect sweet soyles ech where Fine words doth but, betraie the simple eare As fowlers pipe, the harmles bird disseaues That lights on lyme, amid greene birchen leaues. If meere deceit, were banisht from our viewe Deceit deceaues millions of men.False dealing then, would blush to shew his face If wisdome did, disdaine vaine follies newe Old troth in world, would claime his woonted place But cunning wits, doth finenes so embrace That plainnes walkes, like pilgrim to and fro In wandring wise, and knowes not where to go. Wealths thirst drinks riuers dry.Wealth hath desire, to drinke great riuers drie His scalding thirst, cannot be quenched well Want pines awaie, and comfortles doth lie And water tasts, like Tantalus in hell The needy sort, in dolour daily dwell The hautie head, thinks skorne to turne his face And rue the state, of naked wretches case. The fields and lanes, are full of sicke and lame, Who beg and craue, as loud as voice can crie A sauing world spares nothing to the poore.But sauing world, is grown so far from frame No great remorse, remains in passers by Hardnes holds backe, both bag and bounties eie So that no ruth, regard nor pittie comes From sparing hands, and graceles griping thombs. Our prisons all, are pestred with poore soules Whose yelling noise, a tyrants hart may mooue At grates they stand, and looke through peeping holes Prisoners perish for want of comfort.To purchase alms, and trie good peoples loue But penurie, doth so their pashence prooue, With emptie wombe, and hungrie meatles mawe They lay them downe, on boords or wads of strawe. The silly folke, in towne or cottage rude Many silly soules goes a hungrie to bed. With belly full, do seldome go to bed And lookes as leane, as haukes that ill are mude Which often be, with crowes or carraine fed How should men giue, when charitie is dead For money, meat, and clothing now is bard From those that need, the world is waxt so hard. How can full purse, supplie the poore mans went Full purse follows many pleasures. When trull at home, from sheepe lookes for a fleece And master must, be sometimes all a flant And prettie pus, my deere must haue a peece Whose beautie staines, the faire Helen of Greece These things are large, and long to looke vpon By which cold cause, warme charitie is gon. More reasons rise, to make men hold and keepe The crums they catch, from Fortunes table still For purchesars, do walke when plow men sleepe The purchesars plucks all from the poore. Their sacks of corne, is seldome from the mill They take no rest, till thrift bare budget fill Then locke they vp, in chest their golden bags When beggers trudge, and iet about in rags. Cold parts men plaie, much like old plain bopeepe Craftie catchers can play bopeep. Or counterfait, in dock out-nettle still And for their game, there is such hold and keepe That nothing can, escape their reaching skill Much haue yee won, when got is their good will Tis lost againe, for one small graine of gold Their charitie, is growne so extreme cold. Cunning raiseth the price of euery thing.They raise the price, of euery thing is bought On tenter hookes, their ware is stretched out Seekes all the waies, for wealth that may be sought As for the winde, a ship is swaid about And at a trice, they turne the water spout So from our purse, both pence and pounds they draw By hooke or crooke, by wrest or reach of law. Vittles made deere seldome comes downe againe.The rate of things, rackt vp doth fall no more Colde conshence takes, all fish that coms to net To make corne deere, they hoord much graine in store So they may win, some care not how they get For eu'ry bird, they do such lime-twigs set That no bird scapes, if it be flidge to flie Except foresight, the suddaine danger spie. No rain nor curb, nor bridle holds them in No lawe nor rule, nor order will they keepe Sets all abroch, to feede and nourish sin Wicked wolues deuoures the lambs.And plaies the wolues, with lambs when yonglings sleep Makes old folks whine, and babes in cradle weepe And makes the rate, of eu'ry thing so scant That some cries out, that neuer thought of want. A diuelish dearth destroies thousands.A diuelish dearth, is come from darke hell gate To kill cold harts, as hands can crush a crab That blow fals not, vpon the proud mans pate But giues the meeke, and mildest minde the stab Now tell I all, the secrets like a blab As good to shew, a sore whiles wound is greene As let men starue, before the greefe be seene. The loue of wealth, forgets both God and man The loue of wealth forgets all goodnes. And who growes rich, sets little by renowne To catch and hold, the world doth what it can With endles care, in court, in field and towne Craft keepeth vp, plaine honestie fals downe Charitie is dead, and goodnes growes full sicke Wisedome doth drowp, and follie is too quicke. Wealth like a worme, eats vp sweete kernels all As cankers rust, runs into iron and steele Hard closed hands, that will let nothing fall Wants eares to heare, yet fingers hath to feele Hard hands will part from nothing. Well all is right, when world runs like a wheele Round as a top, that scourging can abide Swims vp and downe, and followes time and tide. On present time and muck mans mind is bent Foolish world thinks but our present time. On world to come, no care nor eie they cast What coms with ease, is often rashlie spent And what doth hap, in hands we hold full fast As though our pomp, and pride should alwaies last Yea thinking all, is ours that we can scrape And still for more, do greedie gluttons gape. The many yeers, and winters past and gone Many yeers and maners alters the kinde of man. Hath changde the kind, of grace and goodnes quite Our bodies beares, in flesh a hart of stone That ioined is, with faintie liuer white Which neuer breeds, in breast one good delite Our noughtie minds, may be the cause of this That hath transformd, all Adams babes amisse. A golden age is turnd to copper and brasse.The golden age, of our forefathers wise, Is copper now, or worse than any brasse, We quickly can, clap on a new found gise And weare a maske, seeme shadow in a glasse But bring no worke, nor great good thing to passe Make shew of much, as art sets trifles forth That proues a puffe, in substance little worth. Words is the worn ware that euer was sold.Words are the ware, that each man sets to sale With phrases fine, bedeckt to blinde poore sight Faire promise first, steps forth and tels a tale Of bad deuice, that weies in ballance light For at your need, performance taketh flight And leaues in lake, the foole that words hath won Who paies great paines, for shadowes in the sun. Wit did prefer, good people well of yore Wealth weighs downe euery thing.Welth now with weights, doth wey the ballance down Words and fine talke, leads world the dance before But neither wealth, nor words wins true renown For when the trumpe, doth giue vncertaine sown Men will not then, prepare them for the fight But rather seeke, to saue themselues by flight. Words are waues tossed with wind.Words are the waues, that welters on the seas And works a froth, in colour white as snoe Makes thousands sicke, and breedes a cold disease To those that with, such swelling surges goe Inconstant words, with tide will ebbe and floe But fruitfull deeds, stands firme and fast as rocke That bides the brunt, of eurie blast and shocke Fine Macheuill, is now from Florence flown Matcheuill is now made an English man. To England where, his welcome is too great, His busie books, are heere so red and known That charitie, thereby hath lost hir heat Want of charitie hath made me loose my pattent. Poore prisners doe, in Ludgate die for meat Who doth for det, in danger long remaine Must fall down flat, and seldom rise againe. Wit takes his toll, as milner at the mill The milner will be sure of his toule. Powl feakes the bags, of meale as he doth please Thrusts thousands backe, till tricksie tanker fill Like prentise fine, that faine would take some ease In deed there is, no fishing to the seas But what is caught, in conshence should be sold In market place, that men might credit hold. No charitie, is found when fisher feeds A fine fisher would catch all himselfe. On all himselfe, and giues his fellowes none Alas poore soules, we angle in the reeds And catch a frog, when all the fish is gone Bullhead and loch, lies vnder little stone But stones and sticks, will breake our nets I dout Before we bring, a dish of gudgins out. The great good turnes, in court that thousands felt Good turnes are turnd to faire holy water. Is turnd to cleer, faire holie water there The scraps are small, that hungrie hands haue delt Spoile cannot spare, the paring of a peare For snatch crust robs, almes baskets eury where The poore so starues, or knowes not what to do And so I feare, shall sillie suters to. The father scarse, will speake for his owne son The father will scarse speake for his sonne.World waxeth mute, when men should do some good The streame is stopt, where water ought to run We cast our nets, where fish creepes in the mud And clime those trees, where bowes will neuer bud We take great paine, yet no good fruit enioies For words are wind, and fils our eares with noies. The soldier consumes himselfe with griefe.The soldier sits, and sighes to shake off greefe Whose wounds in war, of right claimes great reward Waits hard at heele, but findeth small releefe Who least deserues, is alwaies most prefard Who brags and boasts, blind world doth best regard But some that lost, their blood in countries right May kisse the post, and bid vs all good night. What charitie, is that iudge you that can Who sees these things, so far past all redresse A lip wise world cares little for a man.When lip-wise world, sets little by a man What may fall out, of that a foole may gesse Each one shall haue, his lot yea more or lesse But charitie, and fortune differ far Between them two, we find a mortall war. The one helps all, and loues a number still Charitie and fortune differ far.The other hurts, or else prefers a few And wise men find, no hold in hir good will For she is cald, a most inconstant shrew That with the sun, will waste away like dew A sommer flowre, that withers in the frost Coms softly on, and rides away in post. As blind of sight, as euer Cupid was For she lookes not, on vertue any way Nor wisdoms worth, but fauors many an asse Fortune fauors many an asse. For his smooth face, and peacocks feathers gay But charitie is, the only staffe and stay To all estates, for where she stoutly stands She sets all free, and breaketh bondage bands. Forgiues great faults, and suffers many a wrong She giues a badge, that eury christian weares And in all worlds, hir liurey lasteth long Charitie forgiues and forgets iniuries. It garded is, all round about with teares And she hir selfe, a branch of oliue beares In signe of peace, and mercie mixt with grace That pitie takes, of eurie rufull case. This charitie giues, as much as men may craue And soone forgets, the bountie she bestowes Charitie hath no end of his bountie. Takes great delight, the life of man to saue By vertue of, good turnes that from hir floes Whose is sent like, the white and sweet red rose For all hir gifts, and graces beares such flowres That makes poore men, to laugh when fortune lowres. On charitie, the hungrie dailie feeds Charitie giues few words but doth many good deeds. As lambs and sheepe, in fruitfull pasture liue Shee giues few words, where shee bestoes good deeds The more we neede, the sooner will shee giue As corne from chaffe, is sifred through the siue So shee tries out, from dust and drosse the gold As wisdome doth, the worth of men vnfold. Charitie is the first and last shall be blessed.This charitie, is first that fauour findes And shall be last, that wins our worlds good will Begot by grace, and nurst in noble mindes That staies and stands, vpon their honor still Tis seen far off, as torch is on an hill Felt near at hand, and found out by the light Which in darke daies, doth glad ech good mans sight. When fortunes wrath, hath wounded many a wight She brings a boxe, of balm to heale ech sore That makes sad mind, and heauie hart so light It neuer thinks, on wretched chance no more Charitie conquers euery where like a victor.If charitie, like victor goes before Come after hir, proud world with all thy braues Like conqueror, she triumphs on hir slaues. But well awaie, and woe God wot the while True charitie, is faintly felt or found Shee is of late, halfe-driuen in exile Bad life would driue charitie in exile.Because bad life, lets crueltie abound The world is full, of hollow harts vnsound And mercie meets, with ruth scarce once a yeere For rigors rage, doth show such churlish cheere. Men go transformed now a daisMen walke abroad, transformd in sundry shapes More monster like, than babes of Adams brood Fearfull to sight, like vglie owls and apes That hath of kind, no ciuill humane mood Tigers in proofe, nurst vp with woluish food For sillie lambs, that doth no butcher fear They do deuour, and in small peeces tear. Greedy as guls, and gapes for garbedge still, Some people are as greedy as guls. Rauening like woolues, that murthers sheepe in folde Suttle as foxe, that neuer hath his fill Hedstrong and proud, and will not be controld Curtish as kite, ne gentle yoong nor old Such cruell tricks, doth alter so mans minde That long they liue, by craft and dies vnkind. Quarrels encrease, and combats haue no end Quarrels breeds mischiefe and bloudshed. Till bloud be shed, and life and land be lost Some thinks the bow, were better breake than bend On that consait, stands mightie manhood most But charitie, rides then away in post And leaues in lash, behinde hir in some part A heape of harmes, and many a heauie hart. Lust liues by spoyle, like theefe that robs true men Lust is a theefe and robs vs of life. Desires to eate, the hen and chickens all Rauine and rage, prouls fast for profite then So gets some cheate, though it be near so small But lust is like, an image on a wall Strike out the cole, that is but blacke of hue Faire white and cleane, appeers blurd wall to you. Ore weening runs, beyond the course of wit Presumpshon then, doth set best foote before And boldnes knowes, not where to stand nor sit His loftie lookes, prouokes his pride so sore Pride and presumption is bold as blinde bayard. But when threed-bare, his bad spun cloth is wore The world but laughs, to see bald bayard blinde With painted robes, patch vp a stately minde. In cloud vnseene, new fanglenes would walke New fanglenes is easily found out.But he is spide, by old deepe serching sight Fine filed toongs, like parrets prate and talke And wonder makes, of trifling matters light This glorious crew, triumphes in moone shine night But when cleere day, such idols doth disclose World will point out, where eurie shadow goes. Wilfull heads hates good counsell.Wilde wilfull heads, that all sound counsell hates A careles course, of borrowed life doth lead Whose retchles race, still argues and debates They soone forget, good lessons that they read But when the foot, awrie the shue doth tread Downe goes the heele, yea seam the sole and all And so vnwares, a man in mire may fall. And stumbling oft, makes some to snapper still Ill custome Breedes abuse.Vse mastrie breedes, and custome pleads a law Let bridle goe, the horse will haue his will Much water scarse, will quench hot fire in straw A stubborne childe, that still doth backward draw Must needes be whipt, to make him feare the rod So we are plagud, when we forget our God. Three sundrie plagues, the wrath of God doth show Two plagues past threatens a third.The first is past, the second you may see The third ye wot, the world too well doth know For that cuts downe, corne, grasse, and highest tree The angrie cloudes will neuer calmie bee Till better life, seaise all our showres of raine And Gods great grace, brings sommer home againe Shame followes pride, and death comes after sin Shame followes pride, and dearth nipped sore. Then famine kils, vp thousands where it flies They will take heed, that hath well scourged bin And fall to mend, their liues if they be wise But in our world, such new found fashons rise All frames not well, looke into ech mans waies Small charitie, is seen in these bad daies. When charitie, proud painted posts plucks downe To God and prince, great honor shall arise Proud painted posts are rotten in the middle. When plainnes thriues, in court and ciuill towne Old troth will bid, farewell our newfound gise Goodnes will come, and so aduance the wise Dunses and dolts, shall stand beneath the bar And pride shall blush, that doth presume too far. The least of most, makes most of his bad stuffe So leers and looks, as frighted were his wits Pride alubberly lout, lookes like a monarke. Is neuer well, till pride be in his ruffe Than monarke like, on loftie seat he sits (Whose scornfull hart, is full of froward fits) But speaks no word, for feare that bayard blinde Should plunge before, and yearke at him behinde. The woorst with best, compares and striues for place The woorst wid hie hart, compares with the best. As gold and glas, in woorth weare all alike Beares out his brags, with scowling brazen face That cannot blush, no more than can blacke tike He frowns so sore, he lookes as he would strike The crabbish carle, so curst and cumbrous is Then when he speakes, in schoole the schollers hisse. A surly sire swels like a toad.The surly sire, sits swelling like a toad That venom casts, on goodly herbs and floures Not pleased well, in house nor yet abroad Nor seemes to haue, ne quiet daies nor houres When cheerefull folke, doth smile this churle he loures A swarme of such, checkmates a man may see If stagers come, where fresh fine fellowes bee. A stately stalke thinks none like himselfe.The stately stalks, that will ne stoup nor bend Will speake no word, till first yee them salute Holds head aloft, but downe no looke will lend Faire blossomd trees, that brings foorth no good fruit Nay sickles sharpe, that reaps vp many a sute Their haruest hath, cut downe the corne so cleane They leaue in field, the poore no graine to gleane. A craftie crue are wilier than the foxe.The craftie crue, more wily than old Foxe Runs flocking on, as sheepe to fold doth flie Takes what they may, and giues but scornes &amp; mocks They want no wiles, within the winde to lie Drains riuers vp, and drinks great fountaines drie At first rebound, strikes backe the tennis ball (From those that plaies) as though they would haue al. Cunning lads are as quicke as a Bee.The cunning lads, that creepes through auger holes As quicke as Bee, seekes honie eury where Feeds body fat, but cares not for their soles Their snatching shewes, what greedy minds they beare Who lends the poore, ne louing looke nor eare Brings emptie paunch, to mouth vp all alone Skornes and disdaine, to fling a dog a bone. Preferments were, the marks whereat we shot Preferments are not got with shooting too short. But past our aime; and reach those marks do stand For ere we draw, the bow the game is got Or else the string, doth breake within our hand Our plaine prick-shafts, were wont to cleaue a wand But now so blunt, and flat the heads are worne When archer shoots, leud world laughs him to scorne. They hit the white, that neuer shot before They hit the white that haue good hap. No marke men sure, nay bunglars in their kind A sort of swads, that scarce can shoot twelue score Nor hath no skill, to know where blowes the winde Lo thus you see, that fortune is but blinde To giue them hap, whose knowledge is so bace They scarce deserue, a simple pedlars place. Ech man prefers, his friends and seruants both Ech man prefers his seruants and friends. The Queenes poore men, findes few to help their hap I praie you who, doth speake for plaine Tom-troth Which plies them all, with curchie, knee and cap His old crab tree, is burnd with thunder clap Blacke are the bowes, that once grew greene and gaie The rune of time, doth threaten his decaie. How should men liue, that haue no chinks to spend Steele now lacks strength, to strike out fire from flint Hold fast the gnoff, will neither giue nor lend Hope-well can get, no money from the mint Hope well can get no money from the mint. All things we haue, are set now at a stint Nip-crust the carle, hath crept so neere the crums That nothing scapes, from hungrie hucksters thumbs. Serue long spends much and gets little.Serue long waite well, spend much and little get May be compard, to walking horse for nought Brings many men, in danger and in det For wit and time, thereby is deerlie bought As when a drudge, all daie hath trulie wrought And goes to bed, vnpleasd or paid aright He thinks daies toile, brings beggrie home at night. VVho makes haste to amend any misse.I pray you who, makes haste to mend this misse The man in the moone, as soone as any one By which cold signe, true loue and charities Growne now more cold, than ice or marble stone As dogs do striue, and snarre about a bone So for good turnes, the people throng and thrust So thicke God wot, we know not who to trust. New natures alters good old conditions.These natures new, doth argue plagues most strange To come if now, No famine heere were had For as we do, our old good maners change So world I feare, hencefoorth will be too bad When sober men, growes sauage wilde and mad Looke for small rule, and order heere belowe Our Iudgement daie, thereby drawes neere I trowe. Not one doth right, search and you shall see.Not one doth right, with weights when we are waid All are as light, in ballance as a flie For out of frame. are all when all is said Both they below, and those that would sit hie But chieflie such, as vse to sell and bie All sciences, yea all of eury art Are stept on stage, and coms to play their part. Search eury art, artificers and all Artificers and all are light in the ballance. In charitie, behold them as they are And you shall see, their conshence is so small That nere a one, for charitie doth care Do neither church, queer, court, nor country spare And tell me plaine, what charitie is there God grant these daies, true loue be any where. Can plagues cease then, whan eury liuing wight Plagues will not cease till bad life be reformed His neighbour plagues, as far as powre may stretch In ballance iust, not one man waies aright All vse desait, and ly on gard and watch He liues not now, that can not scrat and snatch Men are no saints, world is a world to thend So folly doth, his wilfull faults defend. The man of Ind, can neuer change his skin Nor yet the cat, of mountaine change hir hue So those wilde buds, that euer bad haue bin Wild buds brings foorth no good fruit. Can neuer beare, good fruit nor blossome nue A bitter taste, will neuer go from rue A wicked life, can shew no vertous deed No more than may, a floure spring from a weed. What keepes good course, the weather alters oft Neither world nor weather keeps good course. The heauens seeme, to shew some sodaine change The winds waxe shrill, and loud they blow aloft Familiar friends, for trifles gro full strange Wit waxeth wilde, whose wont was not to range So out of tune, ech thing is wrested now Because abuse, corrupts good nature throw. If sommer once, in twentie yeers growes hot (Whose warmth reuiues, both fruit &amp; floures ech where) Cold winters blast, bites near the bones ye wot Cold pleaseth few, for cold ech one doth feare Why world growes cold, and cold is hard to beare Neither world nor weather keeps good course.Cold weather makes, warme conshence cold I troe So charitie, and goodnes cold doth growe. Cold weather or world pleaseth none.Cold is the aire, the open field and towne Then court must needs, wax colder than it was It seems wise world, cares not for vaine renowne As world doth come, a Gods name let it passe Though charitie, growe thrise as cold as glasse A warmer time, in better tune may bring This hard cold age, when comes a sommer spring. Cold aire kils sometime sound and sicke.Cold snow is not, so good as luke warme milke Hot sun doth melt, cold frost and cakes of ice Thicke frise surmounts, a thin cloke linde with silke Furde gowne exceeds, cold cloth of preshous price Warme loue lasts long, cold fauour growes full nice With warme good will, we win great wordlie good The fire burns best, where most ye clap on wood. Cold loue quicklie takes leaue.Both flame and fire, goes out in weather cold Where neither coles, nor wood mantaines the heat And heat is that, contents both yoong and old For in the same, our sweete delight is great Most men feeds best, with good warme drinke or meat Cold breeds worst blod, and hardlie doth digest Bicause cold things, lies belching long in brest. Cold fortune kils, the strongest man that liues Cold fortune kils any man liuing. Cold countnance cuts, the throte ere we be ware Cold poison dronke, a quicke dispatch it giues Cold cramps dries vp, the sences where they are Cold lims waxe lame, and breeds diseases rare Thus cold mars all, then warmth God send vs now That eurie part, of man feele comfort throw. Cold food is faint, vnto weake stomacks still Cold foode is comfortles and hard to digest. Warme broths keeps health, in perfect sound estate Warme daies we wish, cold bitter aire is ill Cold blasts be nought, sharpe blustring storms we hate Sweetly sun shines, in world earlie or late Cold quicklie caught, goes seldome soone away And long cold nights, kils some before the day. Cold drie hard frost, makes thousands seeke for fire Warme meate giues spreet, to either sicke or sound Cold hungrie baites, makes many a horse to tire Cold hungrie baites may kill a horse. Warme clouts and clothes, doth comfort eurie wound No fruit thriues well, where cold doth much abound The warmth doth ioy, both spring and fall of leafe Makes dead things quicke, delights both dum &amp; deafe Yea blind and lame, and all that life doth beare Are glad of heate, then cold is out of grace Cold words God wot, when meaning scarce is there Cold words makes a man desperate. Kils many a man, in court or any place O wold to God, warme deeds did show his face That charitie, hir whole effect may show On those that needs, which knows not where to goe A colder season in all sorts was neuer seene.A colder time, in world was neuer seene The skies do lowre, the sun and moone waxe dim Sommer scarce knowne, but that the leaues are greene The winters waste, driues water ore the brim Vpon the land, great flotes of wood may swim Nature thinks scorne, to do hir dutie right Because we haue, displeasde the Lord of light. Cold words and workes makes many a heauy hart.Cold works, cold words, cold world and al things cold Showes death drawes neer, and then a deep cold graue Such hard cold hap, may make a yoong man old Or old gray beard, become a gallie slaue Well let them loose, that can ne win nor saue The state of man, on strange hap hazard lies As one fals downe, so doth another rise. If charitie, would once bespread hir raies As Phœbus showes, abroad his shining beames Cold winter may bring some sommer daies.Or winter cold, would bring some sommer daies And rid vs soone, from all these great extreames Then shee dies not, but haplie sleeps and dreames Now waken hir, that haue most powre to speake I haue tane cold, and so my voice growes weake. You whose cleer speech, doth loud as trumpet sound And may command, the world, the skies and stars And rules at beck, the massie earth so round Sets orders downe, and can make peace and wars And hath the force, to breake big iron bars Warme loue may awaken charitie againe.Call charitie, fot loue once home againe That shee may heare, hir people poore complaine. My breath but bores, a hole within the aire The authors breath is on cold to do any good. My date neer don, cals for a shrouding sheet My darke dim daies, lookes for no weather faire Mine eies can scarce, look to my stumbling feet My wounted muse, forsakes my drowping spreet My books and scroules, and all that I haue wrot Hides now their heads, as I were cleane forgot. When aged yeers, showes death amid my face Aged yeers showes death it at hand. My words are of, small credit in this plite My hap and hope, is in a better place Wherefore of world, I plainly speake and write And ere I goe, discharge my conshence quite To win the wise, and loose the fonder sort That vnto quicke, nor dead yeelds good report. The wise well won, waies ech thing as it ought Labor is well bestowed when wise men are won. Mistakes no terme, nor sentence wrests awrie The fond will read, awhile but cares for nought Yet casts on ech, mans works a frowning eie This neither treats, of matters lowe nor hie But finds a meane, that ech good meaning might In all true meanes, take charitie aright. FINIS. A praise of Poetrie, some notes therof drawen out of the Apologie, the noble minded Knight, sir Phillip Sidney wrate. Sidney's notes have been omitted. When world was at the very woorst And vice did much abound And for offence the earth was curst Yet charitie was found. Among the wise and woorthie sort Who euer had good chance with treble fame, by their report True vertue did aduance. The Poets and Philosophers Stept first on stately stage And plaid their parts with hazards great In euery world and age. In eury age while wits of men Could iudge the good from bad Who gat the gift of toong or pen Of world great honor had. Good Poets were in hie esteeme, When learning grew in price Their vertue and their verse did seeme A great rebuke to vice. With blunt base people of small sence They fall now in disdaine But Sydneyes booke in their defence Doth raise them vp againe. And sets them next Diuines in ranke As members meete and fit To strike the worlds blinde boldnes blanke And whet the bluntest wit. Heere followes Histories good store That much thereof shall tell If paines may purchase thanks therefore My hope is answerd well. Amphyons gift and grace was great In Thebes old stories saie And beasts and birds would leaue their meats To heare Orpheus plaie. In Rome were three of peereles fame That florisht in their daies Which three did beare the onely name Of knowledge, skill and praise. In Italy of yore did dwell Three men of spechall spreete Whose gallant stiles did sure excell Their verses were so sweete. In France three more of fame we finde Whose bookes do well declare They beautifide their stately minde With inward vertues rare. In England liued three great men Did Poetrie aduance And all they with the gift of pen Gaue glorious world a glance. In Scotland finde we other twaine Were writers of good woorth Whose studies through their Poets vaine Brought many verses foorth. In Ireland to this present time Where learning is not mich With Poetrie in verse or rime Their language they inrich. In Wales the very remnant yet Of Brittaine bloud and race They honor men of speshall wit And giues a Poet grace. Albinus long that rained heere Made verses in his youth And in his age as doth appeere With verse auancst the truth. Among the sauage Indians still (Who knowes no ciuill thing) They honor writers of some skill Their parents liues to sing. Among the anshent noble Danes And Saxsons long ago We read of many Poets names Whose woorthy wits did flo. The graue wise learned men of Greece Durst neuer shew their art Till those Philosophers presumd To plaie the Poets part. Some sang in verse, their naturall Philosophie we finde And in sweete songs heroicall Exprest their secret minde. So morall counsels vttred were In that same selfe sweete sort Thus Poets flourisht eury where As stories makes report. And marshall matters in those daies Were song and set aloft So some the art of warre did raise Vnto the skies full oft. Sibillas prophesies in verse Were alwaies vttred well The oracels of Delphos to In verse would woonders tell. In pollicies wise Solon plaid The Poet sundrie waies Good things were better soong than said Which gaind immortall praise. Plato tooke Solons works in hand And plaid the Poet right And set that Atlantike Iland Full plaine before our sight. The Booke of Herodotus bore A famous title fine (Yea such as none did giue before) Of all the muses nine. Domician was a Poet rare And did therein excell So many princes now there are That loueth Poetrie well. Three conquerours of mightie powre Gaue Poets such a grace That they would neuer frowne nor lowre On them in any case. As Plutarke saith, a tyrant wept A tragedie to heare Who sawe his murthring minde thereby As in a glas full cleere. Amid a great reuolt in Rome A woorthie Poet stood And told of bodie and the minde A tale that did much good. Two Poets turnd a tyrants hart From rigour vnto ruth And wrought him with their wits and art To fauour right and truth. Nathan did faine a tale indeed To Dauid when he fell Whereon the king tooke such great heed He saw his follie well. In Dauids Psalms true miter floes (And songs of Sallomon) Where great delite and pleasure groes Are woorthie looking on. A dialogue that Plato made Giues Poets great renowne Brings ech rare wit to sun from shade To weare the laurell crowne. True stories old with new delite Shall fill your harts and eares For they of Poets praises write Their books good witnes beares. If aunshent authors and great kings No credit gets herein Darke-sight sees not no stately things That doth great glory win. Plucke vp cleere iudgement from the pit Of poore espreet and sence And wipe the slime from slubbred wit And looke on this defence. That Sydney makes, a matchles worke A matter fresh and new That did long while in silence lurke And seldome came to view. He cals them Poets that embrace True vertue in hir kinde And do not run with rimes at bace With wanton blotted minde. All idle verse he counts but vaine Like cracks of thorns in fire Or summer showrs of sleete or raine That turns drie dust to mire. These rurall rymes are but the scum And froth that flies from seas Or doth from some sharpe humor come That breeds a new disease. In braine that beats about the skull And so brings foorth a toye (When musse or moone is at the full) Of paines or pleasing ioye. Like long wingd hauke, doth Poet sore Ore mountaine or hie trees And loud as cannon can he rore At ech vice that he sees. His scope as hie as reasons reach May clime in order due Not to giue counsell nor to teach But to write fancies new. Of this or that as matter mooues A well disposed minde That vice doth hate and vertue loues And he good cause doth finde. So ruling pen as duties bounds Be kept in eury part For when the Poet trumpet sounds It must be done by art. As though a sweete consort should plaie On instruments most fine And shew their musicke eury waie With daintie notes diuine. Ech string in tune as concord were The guide of all the glee Whose harmonie must please the eare With musicke franke and free. The Poets Lyra must be strung With wire of siluer sound That all his verses may be sung With maidens in a round. So chaste and harmles should they be As words from preachers voice With spiced speech in ech degree Wherein good men reioice. Not farsed full of sollies light That beares ne poies nor weight But flying cleere in aire like flight Whose force mounts vp an height. And seems to pearce the cloudie skies Such poets Sidney likes Whose gentle wind makes dust arise As hie as morice pikes. That lifts aloft the soldiers hart Who doth aduance the same And bends his bodie in ech part Thereby to purchase fame. The sword and lance of marshall men Their Lions courage showes The poets with their wit and pen Tels where their furie flowes. They both are knowne as soone as seene As things of great import The one may verie far ore weene The other in some sort. Stands on his honor sundrie waies And offreth life therefore The poet seekes no more but praise As poets did of yore. Whose words strooke dead the stoutest groomes That euer were in place And sweeped cleane like new made broomes. The foulest cause or case. As water washeth ech thing white And sope might scoure with all The canker of foule worlds delite (More sharpe than bitter gall.) So poets with plaine terms makes cleane The foulest conshence liues And by good words from vice doth weane (Through councell that it giues.) The childest wit and churlisht mind Lo then how poets may Both alter maners and bad kind To frame a better way. Of heauens and the highest throne Where God himselfe doth sit Good poets still should treat alone To showe their slowing wit. As by their muse they caried were Beyond our sight or vew Into a fine and purer aire Or speshall climat new. Where all things are as cleane as gold From furnace to the stamp So poets should this world behold And shine as cleer as lamp. That light doth giue to eury eie Which doth in darknes dwell And glorie show of heauens hie To damned spreets of hell. Which darknes in a dungeon keeps From sight of vertues lore Where ignorance in slumber sleeps Like dunse for euermore. Sir Philip Sydney praiseth those Whose waking wits doth see The depth and ground of verse or prose And speakes with iudgement free. Of all the matters vnder sun Both secrets hie and lowe And ouer them with pen can run As far as skill can goe. Sift eurie word and sentence well And cast away the bran To show the kernell, crack the shell In peeces now and than. That eurie one shall taste the nut Or see where worme hath fed And shoot an arrowe at the but And drawe it to the head. Like archer that can hit the white And win the wager straight With cunning knowledge and delite And suttle sence and slaight. Which looks into the world so round And searcheth eury place To see what may be easlie found Or spoke of ech mans case. To rime and roue in retchles sort He counted reuell rash As whip doth make a horse to snort When carter giues a lash. So ballet makers doth with wind Stir vp a hiue of bees And of the abundance of vaine mind With words in aire he flees. As though it were a thunder crack That neuer brings foorth raine But dailie threatens rune and wrack With ratling rumors vaine. Vaine commedies that stirs vp vice He did condemne and hate He holds that babble of no price That doth infect a state. Corrupts with words good maners still Offends both eie and eare Brings in loose life by customs ill And takes away true feare Of God and man, such Poets leud Were banisht and exilde Because with foule condishons shreud Their country they defilde. Good Poets were in eury age Made of and nourisht well They were the floures of gardens gaie That gaue the goodly smell. The true forewarners of great things That after did befall The ioy of godly vertuous kings And honest subiects all. Our age and former fathers daies (Leaue Goore and Chauser out) Hath brought foorth heere but few to praise Search all our soyle about. Yet of all those that newly wrate In prose or verse of late Let Sydney weare (for stile of state) The garland lawreate. His bookes makes many bookes to blush They shew such sence and wit Our dribbers shoots not woorth a rush When he the marke doth hit. His phrase is sifted like fine floure That maketh manchet bread Sweet eury where and nothing soure That flowes from Sydneyes head. Sweete dewe dropt out of Sydneyes quill As raine great moysture shoes And from his muse there did distill A liquor sweete as rose. Aquintesence, a spirit of wine Naie Nectar better namde A breuage for the Gods deuine Of compounds made and framde. That whosoeuer drinks thereon Immortall shall be made His books he left to looke vpon When we in worldly shade Sits mumping eury houre of daie And scarce knows where we are Our braines like bucke doth stande at baie Beset about with care. Of this or that when Sydneyes books Cals vp a drowping ghost For whosoeuer thereon looks (With worldly troubles tost) He shall finde quietnes thereby And Christian comfort great Woorth all the treasure vnder skie It climes to Ioues hie seat. And sits among the Angels sweet Where psalmes and himnes are sung And all base humors vnder feet Are out of fauor flung. The poets that can clime the cloudes Like ship boy to the top When sharpest stormes do shake the shroudes Sets ware to sale in shop. Of heauenly things that earthly men Can scarcely vnderstand Did not our Chausers golden pen (That beautifide this land.) Reach to the sunne and highest star And toucht the heauens all A poets knowledge goes so far That it to mind can call. Each wonder since this world began And what was seene in skies A poet is no common man He lookes with Argoes eies. Like Linx throw steele or stonie wals No secret scapes his sight Of future time and what befals In world by day or night. He sees and somtimes writes thereof When scornfull people scowle And makes of earnest words a scoffe Or cals faire speeches fowle. Our countrie breeds vp Poets still As grasse springs from good ground For there doth flourish learned skill Where knowledge doth abound. Looke what our elders wits did sowe Or left behinde in heapes Our age and haruest people mowe Or with sharpe sickle reapes. The seede of sence, faire fruit brings foorth In feeld a thousand fold And is in value price and woorth More preshous than the gold. What can be counted foule or cleane But Poets thereon talke Yet thousands knowes not what they meane When they in cloud will walke. As from the fountaine water floes (Conuaid by gushing pipe) So from the pen of Poet goes Fine words and sentence ripe. That ech good minde may well digest As sweete as honie sure His termes are taken with the best If verse be neate and pure. As riders whisking wand doth feare The horse whereon he sits So wrangling people eurie where At verses vex their wits. If any writer touch the gall In pastime be it sed Then downe coms tressels house and all Vpon the poore mans head. Yet wise men will good words embrace And take each thing in worth And giue each word and line a grace That poets do set forth. Diuine du Bartas merits praise Most excellent verse he wrate So sundrie writers in our daies Haue done full well of late. In Spensers morall fairie Queene And Daniels rosie mound If they be throwly waid and seen Much matter may be found. One Barnes that Petrarks scholler is May march with them in ranke A learned Templers name I mis Whose pen deserues great thanke. A number more writs well indeed They spring vp newly now As gazing world their works shall reed So shall world praise them throw. But sure my noble Sidneies skill I neuer can forget To him my seruice and good will Shall euer dwell in det. Of learned lore the onely light Which blazde like lampe most cleere And as a star in moone shine night Could vnder cloud appeer. Seemd dim and darke to dazled eies But faire and bright to those That vnderstood the stately gise Of learned verse or prose. Could crack the nut of [illeg.] shell And shew the kernell plaine For by his works who notes them well In world he liues againe. The booke that doth of poets treat In golden robes so shines It triumphes still with honor great Among the best diuines. Which booke deckt vp in trim attire Of authors wise and graue In matters of mine owne desire Great light to poetrie gaue. And made me write of poets praise Thus so to starrie skie My Sidneies honor heere I raise As far as fame can flie. FINIS.</field>
