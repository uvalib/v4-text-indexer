A REVISED COLLECTION OF POEMS WRITTEN IN EARLY YOUTH. “Ascoltate in rime sparse il suono Di quei sospiri ond' io nudriva il core In sul mio primo giovenile errore Quand' era in parte altr' uom da quel ch' i' sono.” Petrarca, Sonnet I. BOOK I. THE FIRST TIME. “A te le luci mie Volgo, o stella, che serri ed apri 'l die.” Tasso, Canzone XV. DEDICATION. (To J. F.) I Memory, on this shrill harp, records How Love with Pain waged mortal strife. Her songs she sings to fitful chords. Those songs may now be empty words, But, ah! they once were life. II With bleeding breast, and broken wing, Love, wounded in the unequal sight, Made moan to Memory, murmuring ‘Sing me to sleep with songs that bring Sweet dreams of lost delight!’ III Then, o'er the harpstrings bending, she Began to sing of joys that sprung To flower when youth was fancy-free; And, since she sung of youth, to thee, Friend of my youth, she sung. IV Friend of my youth, and guide! and oh Far more than friend, far more than guide! Whose heart from mine nor bribe nor blow, Nor many a fault, nor many a foe, Have ever turn'd aside. V O tenderest heart in bravest breast, No lie can lure, no truth offend! In wisdom wisest, manliest In massive manhood! O my best, First, last, and noblest friend, VI Accept—not these, the sobs and cries Of spent emotions, songs that be Salt with the tears of Boyhood's eyes— Not these—but all their utterance tries To save from death, for thee: VII Delights that, dying, turn'd to pains: Summers that, fading, left behind No store, alas! of ripen'd grains, But roseleaves strewn, and wandering strains Of music on the wind. VIII Sung sorrows, these, of sorriest sort, Because they once were joys! dead leaves That have been flowers, but now the sport Of hungry winds whose drear resort Is round dismantled eaves: IX Love's failures, blown thro' chinks of rhyme By gusts of aimless grief, they are. Arisen from out a ruin'd time, And whirl'd in passion's stormy clime, They will not wander far. X Yet, where the wind blows, let them play, And lightly o'er thy pathway lie; Nor crush these dead leaves down i' the clay. Fair, living, loving things were they. They did not wish to die. XI They were the summers of my heart: They are the memories of my youth. Take them, for what they are—some part Of what I was—things void of art, But not devoid of truth. XII For, tho' thy princely heart retains The loftiest sons of song in fee, To thee these else-uncared-for strains My own heart pours. In thine remains Fit place for them, and me. XIII And thee my lays may please, tho' much Unfit for praise by others sound. Since music, little prized as such, Hath, haply, power to find, and touch, And wake to answering sound, XIV Some secret chord in hearts that take Their pleasure from the voice that sings:— Songs welcomed for the singer's sake, Or for the memories they awake Of half-forgotten things. PROLOGUE. I There is a pleasure that is born of pain. The grave of all things hath its violet. Else why should Love with holy rites be fain To deck the bier of Hope, and robe Regret? Why put the posy in the cold clay hand? Why plant the rose above the lonely grave? Why bring the embalmèd corpse across the wave, And deem the dead more near in native land? II Wherefore, if I have girt the loin, and lit The pilgrim lamp, along the waste of years To find the backward path, and follow it, Thro' many a dubious winding wet with tears, Thither where, wormlike and unwitness'd, stole Into youth's unripe rose the wingless Love Who round about his budding winglets wove The fibres of the substance of my soul, III It is not with resentful hand to cast From out the blemisht garden of my life A single floweret of the faded past, Nor from the roots with unreluctant knife Tear any thought whose canker'd growth, once green, Fed wasteful wishes. Past with past is twined So in the midmost texture of the mind, That from the tangled depths of what hath been IV Who can pluck out the bitter weed of pain, Nor harm one tendril of remember'd joy? Who, tho' resolved to rid the burthen'd brain Of love's regrets, love's memories would destroy? Not I, at least, whate'er those memories be! To whom, upsmiling from the past laid bare, The innocent eyes of Childhood plead ‘Forbear! Nor injure us, who never injured thee.’ V Unhurt, undimm'd, tho' mine with tears be fill'd, Still smile, sweet eyes! still light my footsteps on Far off in Memory's holiest haunts to build A bower for Love's last bride, Oblivion! And thou, divine Remembrance, thou that art The cupbearer of gods, with rapture strong Brim all these vacant chalices of song! Pour out thy nectarous urn! I hold my heart. VI I hold my heart. It fills, o'erflows mine eyes, And thro' the flashing fall of sudden tears, Dim in the starlight of delicious skies, Once more the garden of my youth appears, Once more the form, the face, that made erewhile Dull time divine, and all his glowing hours Deep heavens wherein love dwelt! The breath of flowers Is on the air, and on my spirit her smile, VII Sweet with unspoken joy. The breeze is dead. The leaf is silent on the slumbrous bough, As I at her loved feet. No word is said, But I can feel her warm hand wandering now Thro' my thrill'd hair. We are alone together. How? where? What matter? Somewhere in a dream, Drifting, slow drifting down a starlit stream. Whither! Together, and I care not whither! VIII The summer moon is set. There is no light Save of the thick-sown stars—a glory pale In purple air—and what, by fits, makes bright Red oleanders in a rocky vale Flusht by the twinkling fly, whose tremulous spark Throbs in and out, like passion-kindled hope Thro' mine own heart. I knew the laurell'd slope, I know each cypress sighing on the dark, IX I know the flowers, the fields, and whence she twined Thro' those warm curls the wild anemonies. Stream, you sweet curls, forever unconfined, In hovering shade o'er these enraptured eyes! Fall not, you favour'd flowers, from that white hand! Stay, shy foot, peeping from this snowy skirt! No daisy, prest by you, was ever hurt. O love, forever thus before me stand! X “Forever thus?” Ah, rash illomen'd word! Most sure to rouse the slumbering Fates to wrath, When on the foolish lips of Joy 'tis heard. Joy, that was never longlived, and whose path Is thro' a world that knows him not! Sad years Have worn that moment's place from memory now, And she is gone,—I know not where, but know Wishes are pilgrims to the vale of tears; XI And every wind is burthen'd with the moan Of some man's loss. By night, on Shinar plain, 'Mid Babel's battlements by Heaven o'erthrown, No baffled builder ever wail'd in vain Hope's fabric fallen, with a grief more bleak, More bitter, more unshelter'd, than my own. For all I built and blest is broken down, And if I lean upon my heart 'twill break. XII Behold these shatter'd shards—once aëry towers, With pillar'd porches, built into the blue Of blissful climes, the home of happy hours,— Now ruins bare, round which the years renew Only the casual weed, and creeping shade. Pause, stranger, and be sad that such things were And are not. Say, at least, the plan was fair, The structure bravely, beautifully, made. XIII How firmly hewn from out the inmost heart, How lightly lifted to the upmost heaven, The temple rose! and, ah, by what fond art With hallow'd names its gracious walls were graven! What spacious music bathed these silent shrines Of pious harps by priestly fingers play'd! What happy whisperers wander'd in the shade Of these lone aisles where now no taper shines! XIV But there Bliss settles not. She will not dwell In any habitation made by hands. Free as the bird of heaven, nor tameable By careful craft, she over seas and lands Hovers in hollow air. From spray to spray, Set trembling by her touch, she springs, and sings; And, while thou listenest, upon lightest wings, Scared by a sigh, a breath, she flits away. XV Build not! It comes and goes without our will, The wisht Delight, for which we early rise, And so late rest, and so long labour still. Sleep! heedless, deedless, mindless, with shut eyes. And o'er thy dreaming head, with wings aquiver, 'Twill perch unsummon'd, and ungreeted sit. O breathe not, breathe not! Fear to welcome it. Soon as thou call'st it thine, 'tis fled forever. XVI I cannot build again, but I will deck With flowers of later growth, Love's broken pile. The bliss that's gone I cannot beckon back, But beauty haunts the heart it fill'd erewhile. These balms and spices, strewn the bier above Of one fair corpse, shall from corruption save her. I bless my lost one for the love I gave her, And blame not anything she gave my love. THE MAGIC LAND. I By woodland belt, by ocean bar, The full south breeze our foreheads fann'd, And lightly roll'd round moon and star Low music from the Magic Land. II By ocean bar, by woodland belt, More fragrant grew the glowing night, While, faint thro' dark blue air, we felt The breath of some unnamed Delight; III Till Morning rose, and smote from far Her elfin harps. Then sea, and sky, And woodland belt, and ocean bar, To one sweet note, sigh'd Italy! DESIRE. The Night is come,—ah, not too soon! I have waited her wearily all day long, While the heart, now husht, of the feverish noon In his burthen'd bosom was beating strong. But the cool clear light of the quiet moon Hath quench'd day's fever, and forth in song, One by one, with a boyant flight, Arise day's wishes releast by night. The night is come! On the hills above Her dusky hair she hath shaken free, And her tender eyes are dim with love, And her balmy bosom lies bare to me. She hath loosen'd the shade of the cedar grove, And shaken it over the long dark lea. She hath kindled the glow-worm, and cradled the dove, In the silent cypress tree. O Hesperus, bringer of all sweet things, Hear me in heaven, and favour my call! Bring me, O bring me, what naught else brings, The one sweet thing that is sweeter than all. Bring me unto her, or bring her to me, Whose unseen eyes I have felt from afar. I feel I am near her, but where is she? I know I shall find her, but when shall it be? O hasten it, Hesperus star! My heart, as a wind-thrill'd lyre, Throbs audibly. Bright in the grove, Like mine own thoughts taking fire, The star-flies hover and rove. Arise! go forth, keen-eyed, swift-wing'd Desire! Thou art the Bird of Jove, And strong to bear the thunders that destroy, Or fetch the ravisht flute-playing Phrygian boy. Go forth athwart the world, and find my love!— FATALITY. I I have seen her,—the Summer in her soft hair, And the blush rose husht in her face, And the violet hid in her eyes! And my heart, in love with its own dispair, Speeded each pulse's passionate pace To that goal where pain is the prize. II Hair, a Summer of glories fill'd With odours! Lips that are ever Spring: The budding and birth of all joys that be, All blossoms that brighten, all beams that gild, All birds that gladden, all breaths that bring Delight to the spirit in me. III And oh, that smile of divine surprise, That slid out slowly, and lapp'd me round With a rosy rapture of warmth and light! It began in the dark of her deep blue eyes, And, o'erflowing her face and her faint lips, drown'd Past, present, and future, quite, IV In a sea of wonder without a shore. As tho', while you gaze at a drop of dew, It should silently open, and softly rise, And spread to a deluge, and cover you o'er. So round me, and over me, greaten'd and grew The smile of those sorrowful eyes. V What sort of a world will the world be now? Oh, never again what the world hath been! And how happen'd the marvellous change? What my old life meant I begin to know, But I know not what may this new life mean. It is all so sweet and strange! VI Enough to be sure of,—that, hand in hand, We have seen, with each other's eyes, The heavens grow happier o'er us, And, here below, in the lovely land, As, there above, in the blissful skies, A world of beauty before us! TRANCE. I My body sleeps: my heart awakes. In search of thee my dreams have roved Dim slumber's deeps. The last wave breaks, And brings me to thy breast beloved. O stretch thy gracious hand to me, Thro' sleep, thro' night! I hear the rills, And hear the leopard in the hills, And down the dark am drawn to thee. II The vineyards and the villages Were silent in the vales, the rocks. I follow'd past the myrrhy trees, And by the footsteps of the flocks. Wild honey, dropt from stone to stone Where bees have been, my path suggests. The winds are in the eagles' nests. The stars are hid. I walk alone. III The stars are hid, the moon is set, Ah wilt thou let me die forlorn? Upon my hair the dews are wet. Upon the rocks my feet are torn. With kisses, never kist, alas! My lips are parcht: with tears unshed Mine eyes are dim: and, faint, I tread With dizzy step the mountain pass. IV My path is lost: my staff is gone: My strength is spent: my lamp is out. O love, the night is well nigh done. The camphor clusters all about Gleam chilly-white, and I can see The far off dawn. O haste, O haste, And draw me from the unshelter'd waste, And draw me from the world to thee! A VISION OF THE MORNING. I One yellow star, the largest and the last Of all the lovely night, was fading slow (As fades a lingering pleasure in the past) And all the east was fair, when, yet aglow With dreams her looks had glorified, from sleep I waked, and oped the lattice. Like a rose Red morn began to blossom and unclose A flushing brightness on the dewy steep. II A bell was chiming thro' the crystal air From the high convent church upon the hill. The folk were loitering by to matin prayer. The church-bell call'd me out, and seem'd to fill The heaven with pleasant hopes. I reach'd the door Ere yet full-hearted hymns began to rise And roll their liquid latin melodies Round pious groups that strew'd the lucid floor. III Breathless I slid among the kneeling folk. Shrill silvery tinklings bubbled thro' a pause Of inward prayer. Then forth the clear chaunt broke Along grey sculptured aisles which in a gauze Of sunlight glimmer'd. Thickly throbb'd my blood. I mark'd, in depths of glory-colour'd shade, Many a little dusk Italian maid Kneeling and murmuring: and a multitude IV Of misty splendours the dyed morning shook Thro' the dim-threaded window's flame-lit webs. They touch'd the crown'd Apostle with his hook, And trembled where the sea of jasper ebbs Round those white-footed Saints that stand serene, Each with his legend, each in his own hue Attired; some, ruby-red, some, sapphire-blue, These topaz-golden, and these beryl-green. V Wherefrom, aslant the snowy altar, roll'd A radiant interfusion of soft stains. The organ groan'd, and greaten'd, and grew bold, Blowing abroad melodious hurricanes. And, bathed in bliss, while that long music peal'd, I, looking sideways, near a little shrine Saw, silent in a dim sweet light divine, Irene, with claspt hands and cold lips seal'd. VI As one that, musing on some mountain height, Above the breeze that breaks from vineyard walls, Seized by the impulse of a swift delight, Bows earthward, feels the hilltop heave, and falls, I sank beside her. All things seem'd to expand And reel. A wind of music swept the air. And, when it ceased in heaven, I was aware That, thro' a rapture, I had toucht her hand. A VISION OF THE EVENING. I Is it a vision? Or Irene, lone, With loosen'd bodice, by the lattice, where Night's overflowing beauty with her own Is mingled in the dimly glowing air Of that rich treasure-chamber which enshrines Her sleeping breath, her unrobed loveliness, All of her the long daylight doth but guess, Her dreams, and musings,—loves most hidden mines! II One taper twinkles in the gorgeous room Mimick'd by many a ghostly looking glass. White moonlight, creeping thro' rich-coloured gloom Doth all along the dreamy chamber pass, As tho' it were a little faint with fear (Being new come into this quiet place In such a quiet way) at the strange grace Of that lone lady, and what else is here:— III Heapt blooms—narcissus, iris purple-crown'd; Blue airy larkspur; basil; hyacinths Flooding faint fragrance, richly curl'd all round, Corinthian cool columnar flowers on plinths; And crumpled pinks, creamwhite and crimson ones; Large amber lillies; and the regal rose That for the breast of queens full scornful blows; All pinnacled in bossy urns of bronze. IV Tables of inwrought stone,—true Florentine; Olympian circles throng'd with Mercuries, Minervas, jewell'd Junos, dug i' the green Of ruin'd Rome; and Juno's own deep eyes Vivid on peacock plumes Sidonian: A ribbon'd lute, young Music's cradle; books Vellum'd and claspt: and, with bewilder'd looks Madonna, babe on bosom, smiling wan. V From scented lawns, and thickets dark beneath, The eddying music of the nightingale Thrills thro' the open'd lattice, on the breath Of many a balmy, dim blue, glimmering vale. The howlet's sullen watch with fitful cheer Flutters dark silence in the drowsy grove. An infant breeze from the elf-land of Love, Lured by the dewy hour, creeps lisping near. VI And now is all the night her own, to make it Or grave, or gay, with throngs of waking dreams. Now grows her heart so ripe, a sigh might shake it To showers of fruit all golden as beseems Hesperian growth. Why not, or nights like this, Should Daphne out from yon green laurel slip? A Dryad from each ilex, with white hip Quiver'd and thong'd to hunt with Artemis? VII Tonight, what wonder were it, while such shadows Are dancing with such lights on moony mountains, Such star-flies straying thro' low emerald meadows, Such laughters leaping out of upland fountains, If some wisht face should from the window greet her, Whose eyes shall be more starry than the night's, Whose voice a well of liquid love-delights, And to the distance sighingly entreat her? THOUGHTS AT SUNRISE. The lark leaves the earth, With the dew on his breast. And my love's at the birth, And my life's at the best. What bliss shall I bid the beam bring thee Today, love? What care shall I bid the breeze fling thee Away, love? What song shall I bid the bird sing thee, O say, love? For the beam, and the breeze, And the birds—all of these (Because thou hast loved me) my bidding obey, love. Now the lark's in the light, And the dew on the bough. And my heart's at the height Of the day that dawns now. THOUGHTS AT SUNSET. I. Just at sunset I would be In a bowery island. Tree Interlacing tree shall strew Sighs and shadows over me; Whom some Odysseian crew (Far too foolish, or too wise, Here in happy bowers to be Woo'd away from labour due To their chieftain's stern emprise) Putting forth in haste to sea, Half an hour before moon rise, Left behind them, fancy-free, Careless of their shouts and cries, Mine own pleasure to pursue Thro' the warm isle's witcheries. And, if anywhere the breeze Shall have stirr'd those island trees, I, forthwith, may haply view (Lying, lull'd by leafy sighs, Underneath in grassy ease) Who knows what of strange and new? Some white naiad's wistful eyes? Or a woodnymph's rosy knees? Or a faun's hoof peeping thro'? These, or stranger things than these! II. Nay! already Fancy, tired Of her isle too soon desired, Lightly borne on laughing wind Leaves the lazy land behind. For the seaborn airs that sigh All about the rosy sky Seem, in wishful tones, to say ‘Rise, O rise, and haste away!’ Seen from sea is sunset best. Forth into the boundless west, Ere yon sinking sun be set! Where the seas and skies are met, And the lights are loveliest Round the deathbed of the day, Find me on the breezy deck Of some fleet felucca,—nest Of old seabirds, born for prey, Who these shallow seas infest. Fancy me brown-faced as they, With hawk eyes that watch one speck 'Twixt the crimson and the yellow; Which shall be a little fleck Of cloud, or gull with outstretcht neck, To Spezia bound from Cape Circello. With a sea-song in mine ears Of the bronzen buccaniers, While the night is waxing mellow, And the helmsman slackly steers— Leaning, talking, to his fellow, Who hath oaths for all he hears; Each thief swarthier than Othello! III. Ah, but wander where she will, Here is Fancy's birthplace still; And, tho' far and wide she roam, Long she may not leave her home. Dear, I have not any want Deeper than to be with you, When the low beam, falling slant, Stains the heaven with rosy hue, And, with shuddering pleasure, pant The awaken'd woodlands blue; And about his leafy haunt, While the stars are faint and few, The tumultuous firefly flashes; And such languor softens thro' The deep lights 'neath those long lashes As the heart, it steals into, First inspires, and then abashes. Just to touch your hand—one touch, The lightest,—more would be too much; Just to watch you leaning o'er That wandering window-rose . . . . no more! ONE NIGHT. I A falling star, that stream'd across The intricate and twinkling dark, Vanish'd, yet left no sense of loss Throughout the wide etherial arc II Of those serene and solemn skies That round the dusky prospect rose, And seem'd to rise, and still to rise, Thro' regions of unreach'd repose. III Far on the windless mountain range One crimson sparklet died. The blue Flush'd with a brilliance faint and strange, The ghost of daylight,—dying too! IV Each rose was droopt. Each florid urn Shone dim, where now, in filmy flight, Blind bats began to wheel, and turn, And search the darken'd air for sight; V While, hand in hand, our looks alight With thoughts our faint lips left untold, We sat, in that delicious night, On that dim terrace, green and old. VI Deep down, far off, the city lay, When forth from all its spires was swept A music o'er our souls; and they To music's midmost meanings leapt; VII And, crushing some delirious cry Against each other's lips, we clung Together silent, while the sky Throbbing with sound above us hung. VIII For, borne from bells on music soft, That solemn hour went forth through heaven, To stir the starry airs aloft, And thrill the purple pulse of even. IX O happy hush of heart to heart! O moment molten through with bliss! O Love, delaying long to part That first, fast, individual kiss! X Did the earth tremble underneath? Did some strong star flash thro' the skies? Or was it thy delicious breath, And was it thy divinest eyes, XI That made me feel the tides of sense O'er life's low levels rise with might, And pour my being down the immense Shore of some sudden Infinite? XII “Oh, have I found thee, my soul's soul? My chosen forth from time and space! And did we then break earth's controul? And have I seen thee face to face? XIII “Close, closer to this bursting breast, Closer thy long'd-for arms enfold! I need such warmth, for else the rest Of life will freeze me dead with cold. XIV “Long was the search, the effort long, Ere I compell'd thee from thy sphere, I know not by what mystic song, I know not with what nightly tear: XV “But thou art here, beneath whose eyes My passion falters, even as some Pale wizard's taper sinks, and dies, When to his spell a spirit is come. XVI “What hath life been? What will it be? How have I lived without thee? How Is life both lost and found in thee? Feel'st thou Forever in this Now? XVII “All in a moment! a whole world, With all its wonders strange and far, In one fierce point of glory furl'd; —A universe within a star! XVIII “Born for one bliss that could not fail, How should faith flinch, or patience tire? I knew that time could not prevail Against my soul's intense desire, XIX “Nor shut these famisht eyes in night, Of thee unsolaced. In which faith Doubtless it must have been most light To bear with life, and laugh at death: XX “But now, life hath so much to lose! And death so much to take! the heats Of love's least costly moments use And burn life's essence out in sweets. XXI “Mere antechamber was the past To the crown'd presence of this hour: But, having seen his Queen at last, In all her beauty, all her power, XXII “What merest Page would turn again Content to hum the careless rhyme, Or trifle with the courtier train, That whiled, perchance, a previous time? XXIII “So the old life is lost, I know! The new? 'tis thine, not mine. Mine own, If thou should'st leave me lonely now, I must be hopelessly alone. XXIV “As one idea, half divined, Labours and frets within the brain Of some sad artist, and the mind Is vassal to imperious pain, XXV “For toil by day, for tears by night, Till, in the sphere of vision brought, Rises the beautiful, the bright, Predestined, and relentless Thought, XXVI “So, clothed in the desire of years, This love doth to its destined seat Rise, glowing, through the light of tears, Supreme, triumphant, and complete! XXVII “Ah, dearest! yet the artist's thought Once freed, in form, from forth his soul, By chance and time is seized, and caught Beyond the artist's own controul, XXVIII “To fare, he knows not how, for ill Or well,—be shatter'd, or stand fast. And this freed love, that doth fulfil In thy bright presence my pale past, XXIX “How shall it fare, for weal or woe? Already is it pass'd away How far beyond the yes or no That once was in my power to say! XXX “'Tis mine no longer. It's am I. And it, and I, sweet-heart, are thine. But thou thyself? . . . . dear Destiny, Swear, swear again, that thou art mine! XXXI “Swear, twice and thrice, no future hour Shall ever blight what this hath blest! Nay, I possess thee by the power Whereby I am, myself, possest. XXXII “And, come what may, and pass what must, Why we were born, at last, we know. Spirit to spirit! let the dust Do with the dust what dust can do. XXXIII “Why heed it? Our two souls 'tis sure Now understand the one thing best. This is not earth's: this must endure: Be earth's spite wreak'd upon the rest! XXXIV “These eyes thine own may cease to light, These lips from thine harsh fate may sever. Oh, looks and lips may disunite, But ever love is love forever!” LOVE FANCIES. I. (Morning.) Since we parted yester eve, I do love thee, love, believe, Twelve times dearer, twelve hours longer, One dream deeper, one night stronger, One sun surer,—thus much more Than I loved thee, love, before. II. (Noon.) Is it you . . . . . or a garden of flowers, Blooming, blooming, breathing, breathing, Budding, budding; whence sweet Hours Their delighted brows are wreathing? Is it I . . . . . or a nest of song-birds, Chirping, chirping all together? To the old birds pipe the young birds, ‘Fly, fly! it is summer weather!’ III. (Afternoon.) O leave me, love, that quiet hand, Safe nestled in my folded palm, Till all my soul doth understand That Love's most perfect crown is Calm! I think that, by and by, all things Which were perplext a while ago, And life's long vain conjecturings, Will peaceful, plain, and simple grow. Already, round about me, some August and solemn gladness seems Reposing in a dewy dome Of twilight, o'er a land of dreams Silent, and soft, and infinite. The hush of old warm woods that lie Low in the lap of evening, bright And bathed in vast tranquility! TO IRENE. As, in lone faërylands, 'twixt coral shelf And beryl shaft, to deck the moonlit cave Where haply dwells some beautiful Queen-Elf, Laden with light and music, a spent wave Strews its unvalued sea-wealth (pearl and gem Sent up in homage from the Deep, her slave!) Then sinks back, sighing, into the salt sea; So, from my life's love-laden deeps, to thee I pour these poems. Do not thou contemn Gifts offer'd to thee only. Let them have All they were born for,—not the more or less Of aught that grudging huxters ever gave For such sea-treasures with a greedy guess At this or that pearl's price in weigh'd-out pelf, —But place in the imperial diadem Of thine own fay-born beauty's queenliness. More worth is in them than mere words express. Such pearl-buds, torn from buried branch and stem Of life's deep-hidden growths, attest love's stress. Look down, and see in my sad silent self, Beneath all words, where love lies fathomless; And so, dear love, for love's sake value them. Love's words are weak, but not love's silences. AN EVENING IN TUSCANY. Close, O close and clasp, the pages Of that too-long-pamper'd book! Leave all poets of past ages, You, my living poem! Look, Down the summer-colour'd weather The sweet day begins to sink! And the thought that we're together Is the sole thought I can think. Cool the breeze mounts, like this Chianti Which I drain down to the sun. So away with your green Dante! Turn the page—where we begun— At the last news of Ulysses— A grand image, fit to close Such great golden eves as this is, Full of splendour and repose! And look down now, o'er the city Sleeping soft among the hills— Our dear Florence! That great Pitti With its steady shadow fills Half the town up: its unwinking Cold white windows, as they glare Down the long streets, set one thinking Of the old Dukes who lived there; For one knows them, those strange men, so— Subtle brains, and iron thews! There, the gardens of Lorenzo— The long cypress avenues— Creep up slow the stately hill side Where the merry loungers are. But far more I love this still side— The blue plain you see so far! Where the shore of bright white villas Leaves off faint: the purple breadths Of the olives and the willows: And the gold-rimm'd mountain-widths: All transfused in slumbrous glory To one burning point—the sun! But up here—slow, cold, and hoary, Reach the olives, one by one: And the land looks fresh: the yellow Arbute-berries, here and there, Growing slowly ripe and mellow Through a flush of rosy hair. For the Tramontana last week Was about. 'Tis scarce three weeks Since the snow lay, one white vast streak, Upon those old purple peaks. So to-day among the grasses One may pick up tens and twelves Of young olives, as one passes, Blown about, and by themselves Blackening sullen-ripe. The corn too Grows each day from green to golden. The large-eyed windflowers forlorn too Blow among it, unbeholden. Bind these bounteous curls from falling, O my beautiful, my own! 'Tis for you the cuckoo's calling. Hark! that plaintive mellow moan Up the hillside, floating nearer, Past the two white convent towers, Where the air is cooler, clearer, Round our calm and pleasant bowers.— Oh, that night of purple weather! (Just before the moon had set) You remember how together We walk'd home?—the grass was wet— The long grass in the Poderé— With the balmy dew among it: And that nightingale—his airy Song—how joyously he sung it! All the fig-trees had grown heavy With the young figs white and woolly: And the fireflies, bevy on bevy Of soft sparkles, pouring fully Their warm life through trance on trances Of thick citron-shades behind, Rose, like swarms of loving fancies Through some rich and pensive mind. So we reach'd the Logia. Leaning Faint, we sat there in the shade. Neither spake. The night's deep meaning Fill'd the silence up unsaid. Hoarsely through the cypress-alley A civetta out of tune Tried his voice by fits. The valley Lay all dark below the moon. Until into song you burst out— That old song I made for you When we found our rose—the first out Last sweet Spring-time in the dew. Well! . . . if things had gone less wildly— Had I settled down before There, in England—labour'd mildly— And been patient—and learn'd more Of how men should live in London— Been less happy—or more wise— Left no great works tried and undone— Never look'd in your soft eyes— I . . . but what's the use of thinking? Hark! our nightingale—he sings— Now a rising note—now sinking Back in little broken rings Of warm song, that spread and eddy— Now he picks up heart—and draws His great music, slow and steady, To a silver-centred pause! THE UTMOST. Some clerks aver that, as the tree doth fall, Even for ever so the tree shall lie, And that death's act doth make perpetual The last state of the souls of men that die. If this be so,—if this, indeed, were sure, Then not a moment longer would I live; Who, being now as I would fain endure, If man's last state doth his last hour survive, Should be among the blessèd souls. I fear Life's many changes, not death's changelessness. So perfect is this moment's passing cheer, I needs must tremble lest it pass to less. Thus but in fickle love of life I live, Lest fickle life me of my love deprive. LOVE AND TIME. I Because old Time's a rover, Need young Love change his home? Ah, now that summer's over, Old Time, and winter come, Teach young Love to discover, Wheree'er thou roamest, some New ways whereby to love her, If Love with thee must roam! II Old Time, why wilt thou never Let young Love be? Ah why, Because thou art for ever Unkindly fleeting by, Must Love, too, share thy treasons And play me false, like thee? Change thou thy suns and seasons, But leave my love to me! THE SUBJECT'S APPEAL. I Dear despot of thy little state, This busy many-thoughted Me, Which thy sole will doth regulate, Since, 'twixt thy loyal folk and thee, II (Thy loyal folk,—each feeling, thought, And fancy,—all the sentient train That, in me, owns thy sway) there's nought Which may thy sovran power restrain, III Be in the uses of thy power Gentle, as noble monarchs are; Nor vary with the varying hour, But, bright and constant as a star, IV Sit in the system of my soul, And there, unmoved, the motions all Of what thou mak'st my heaven controul. Dear, though I be indeed thy thrall, V And such a grace have kings, though bad, That even rebels, boldest grown By wrongs that make man's patience mad, Do fear to strike against the Crown, VI Yet happy folk makes happy king: And worthiest is that monarch's might Whom freely freemen love, that cling In loyal trust to legal right. CLOUDY WEATHER. I. On the cold hill, under the sky, Here to day, in the cloudy weather, The wind, as he pass'd me by, Laugh'd ‘They two are walking together, Merry, and I know why, For I met them as I came hither.’ II. The swallows were swinging themselves In the leaden-gray air aloft; Flitting by tens and twelves, And returning oft and oft, Like the restless thoughts in me That went, and came, and went, Not letting me even be Alone with my discontent. III. The hard-vext weary vane Rattled, and moan'd, and was still, In the convent over the plain, By the side of the windy hill. It was sad to hear it complain So fretful, and weak, and shrill, Again, and again, and in vain, While the wind was changing his will. IV. I thought of our walks last summer By the convent-walls so green; Of the rose-kiss gather'd from her, Those blossomy walls between, I thought (as we wander'd on, Too happy at heart to speak) How the daylight left us alone, And left his last light on her cheek. V. The plain was as cold and gray (With its villas like glimmering shells) As some north-ocean bay. All dumb in the church were the bells. In the mist, half a league away, Shone the house on the hill where she dwells. VI. There was not a lizard or spider To be seen on the broken walls. The ruts, with the rain, had grown wider, And blacker since last night's falls. O'er the universal dulness There broke not a single beam. I thought how my love at its fulness Had changed like a change in a dream. VII. The olives were shedding fast About me to left and right, In the lap of the scornful blast Black berries and leaflets white. I thought “Of the seed I have cast, Not a fruit will be spared by the blight.” And the ghosts of my hopes swept past, By a cold word put to flight. VIII. How many precious seeds, Yet bearing nor beauty nor worth! The smoke of the burning weeds Came up with the steam of the earth, From the red wet ledges of soil, And the sere vines, row over row,— And the vineyard-men at their toil Who sang in the vineyard below. IX. I thought ‘Can I live without her, Whatever she do or say?’ I thought ‘Can I dare to doubt her, Now when I have given away My whole self, body and spirit, To keep or to cast aside, To dower or disinherit, And use as she may decide?’ X. But ‘Her voice,’ I groan'd, ‘grows colder, And her fair face colder still.’ And ‘Oh,’ I thought ‘if I behold her, Walking there with him under the hill!’ THE STORM. I Both hollow and hill were as dumb as death, While the heavens were moodily changing form. And the hush that is herald of creeping storm Had made heavy the crouch'd land's breath. II At the wide-flung casement she stood, full height, With her glittering hair tumbled over her back. And, against the black sky's supernatural black, Shone her white neck, scornfully white. III I could catch not a gleam of her anger'd eyes, (She was sullenly watching the storm-cloud roll) But I felt they were drawing down into her soul The thunder that darken'd the skies. IV “And so do we part, then, forever?” I said. “O speak only one word, and I pardon the rest!” For sole answer, her white scarf over her breast She tighten'd, not turning her head. V “Ah, must sweet love cruelly play with pain? Or” I groan'd, “are those blue eyes such deserts of blindness That, O woman, your heart hath no heed of unkindness To the man on whose breast it hath lain?” VI Then alive leapt the lightening. She turn'd, in its glare, And the tempest had clothed her with terror: it clung To the folds of her vaporous garments, and hung In the heaps of her heavy wild hair. VII One word broke the silence: but one: and it fell With the weight of a mountain upon me. Next moment All was bellowing thunder, and she from my comment Was gone ere it ceased. Who can tell VIII How I got to my home in the horrible hills, Thro' black swimmings of storm and burst seams of blue rain? Sick, I lean'd from the lattice, and dizzy with pain. And listen'd,—and heard the loud rills, IX And look'd,—and beheld the red moon low in air. Then my heart leapt . . . . I felt, and foreknew, it, before I heard her light hand on the latch of the door! When it open'd at last,—she was there! X Childlike, and wistful, and sorrowful-eyed, With the rain in her hair, and the tears on her cheek, Down she knelt—all her fair forehead fallen and meek In the light of the moon—at my side. XI And she call'd me by every caressing old name She of old had invented and chosen for me, While she crouch'd at my feet, with her cheek on my knee, Like a wild thing grown suddenly tame. XII 'Twas no vision! This morning, the earth, prest beneath Her light foot keeps the print. 'Twas no vision last night! For the lily she dropp'd, as she went, is yet white With the dew on its delicate sheath!— SONG. [As the one star that, left by the morning] I As the one star that, left by the morning, Is more noticed than all night's host, As the late lone rose of October, For its rareness regarded the most, As the least of the leaves in December That is loved as the last on the tree, So sweetest of all to remember Is thy love's latest promise to me. II We must love, and unlove, and, it may be, Live into, and out of anon, Lovetimes no few in a lifetime, Ere lifetime and lovetime be one. For to love it is hard, and 'tis harder Perchance to be loved again. But if living be not loving, Then living is all in vain. III To the tears I have shed, and regret not, What matters a few more tears? Why should love, that is present forever, Be afraid of the absence of years? When the snow's at the door, and the ember Is dim, and I far o'er the sea, Remember, beloved, O remember That my love's latest trust was in thee! DUTY. How like a trumpet from the sentinel Angel, that standeth in the morning star, Empanoplied and plumed, as angels are Whom God doth charge to watch that all be well, Cometh to me thy call, O terrible, That, girt, and crown'd, and sworded for Heaven's war, Standest supreme above the confused jar Of shock'd antagonisms, and the yell Of trampled pain! Thou of the solemn eyes, Firm-fronted Duty, on whose high command My heart waits awed, stretch forth thy harness'd hand, And with a louder summons bid arise My soul to battle. Hark, the muster-roll! Thy name is call'd. Forth, thou poor conscript soul! SACRIFICE. Unto my soul I said . . ‘Make now complete Thy sacrifice by silence. Undeterr'd, Strike down this beggar heart, that would be heard, And stops men's pity in the public street; A mendicant for miserable meat! Nor pay thy vassal, Pain, with any word, Lest so the deed thou doest should be slurr'd By shameful recompense, and all unsweet. Uncover not the faces of thy dead. Slay thy condemnèd self, and hide the knife. And even as death, compassionating life, With gracious verdure doth the graves o'erspread, So hide beneath a smiling face the whole Of thine unutter'd misery, O my soul!’ THE FIRST FAREWELL. I I may not kiss away the tears that still Hang on the lids which those loved eyes enshrine. I may not weep away the tears that fill These aching eyes of mine. II Sleep on, sad soul, shelter'd from love and pain! Or haply shelter love from pain with thee In thy sweet dreams. When we two meet again, 'Tis but in dreams 'twill be. THE LAST WISH. Since all that I can ever do for thee Is to do nothing, this my prayer must be: That thou may'st never guess nor ever see The all-endured this nothing-done costs me. A LOVE LETTER. I My love,—my chosen,—but not mine! I send My whole heart to thee in these words I write; So let the blotted lines, my soul's sad friend, Lie upon thine, and there be blest, at night. II This blossom bruised whose purple blood will stain The page now wet with the hot tears that fall— (Indeed, indeed, I struggle to restrain The weight of woe that breaks thus, spite of all!) III I pluck'd it from the branch you used to praise, The branch that hides the wall. I tend your flowers. I keep the paths we paced in happier days. How long ago they seem, those pleasant hours! IV The white laburnum's out. Your judas-tree Begins to shed those crimson buds of his. The nightingales sing—ah, too joyously! Who says those birds are sad? I think there is V That in the books we read, which deeper wrings My heart, so they lie dusty on the shelf. Alas! I meant to speak of other things Less sad. In vain! they bring me to myself. VI I know your patience. And I would not cast New shade on days so dark as yours are grown, By weak and wild repining for the past, Nor vex sad memory with a bootless moan. VII For hard enough the daily cross you bear, Without that deeper pain reflection brings; And all too sore the fretful household care, Free of the contrast of remember'd things. VIII But ah! it little profits, that we thrust From all that's said, what both must feel, unnamed. Better to face it boldly, as we must, Than feel it in the silence, and be shamed. IX Irene, I have loved you, as men love Light, music, odour, beauty, love itself;— Whatever is apart from, and above, Those daily needs which deal with dust and pelf. X And I had been content, without one thought Our guardian angels could have blush'd to know, So to have lived and died, demanding nought Save, living dying, to have loved you so. XI My youth was orphan'd, and my age will be Childless. I have no sister. None, to steal One stray thought from the lifelong thoughts of thee, Which are the fountains of whate'er I feel. XII My wildest wish was vassal to thy will: My haughtiest hope, a pensioner on thy smile, Which did with light my barren being fill, As moonlight glorifies some desert isle. XIII I never thought to know what I have known,— The ecstacy, of being loved by you: I never thought within my heart to own One wish so blest that you should share it too: XIV Nor ever did I deem, contemplating The many sorrows in this place of pain, So strange a sorrow to my life could cling, As, being thus loved, to be beloved in vain. XV But now we know the best, the worst. We have Interr'd, and prematurely, and unknown, Our youth, our hearts, our hopes, in one small grave, Whence we must wander, widow'd, to our own. XVI And if we comfort not each other, what Shall comfort us in the dark days to come? Not the light laughter of the world, and not The faces and the firelight of fond home. XVII And so I write to you; and write, and write, For the mere sake of writing to you, dear. What can I tell you that you know not? Night Is deepening through the rosy atmosphere XVIII About the lonely casement of this room, Which you have left familiar with the grace That grows where you have been. And on the gloom I almost fancy I can see your face: XIX Not pale with pain, and tears restrain'd for me, As when I last beheld it; but as first, A dream of rapture and of poesy, Upon my youth, like dawn on dark, it burst. XX Perchance I shall not ever see again That face. I know that I shall never see Its radiant beauty as I saw it then, Save by this lonely lamp of memory, XXI With childhood's starry graces lingering yet I' the rosy orient of young womanhood, And eyes like woodland violets sunny-wet, And lips that left their meaning in my blood. XXII I will not say to you what every day Unworthy preachers preach to worthless love. ‘Dance the graves bare, if pipe and tabor play, And call faith folly, if the world approve!’ XXIII I will not cant that commonplace of friends, Which never yet hath dried one mourner's tears, Nor say that grief's slow wisdom makes amends For aching hearts and desolated years; XXIV For who would barter all he hopes in life, To be a little wiser than his kind? Who arm his spirit for continued strife, When all he cared to keep is left behind? XXV But this, this only . . . Love in blackest woe, Still lovelier than all loveless happiness, Hath brilliancies of joy they never know, Who never knew the depth of love's distress. XXVI My messenger (a man by danger tried) Waits in the courts below; and ere our star Upon the forehead of the dawn hath died, Heart of my heart! this letter will be far XXVII Athwart the mountain, and the mist, to you. I know each robber hamlet. I know all This mountain people. I have friends, both true And trusted, sworn to aid whate'er befall. XXVIII I have a bark upon the gulf. And I, If to my pain I yielded in this hour, Might say . . . ‘Sweet fellow-sufferer, let us fly! ‘I know a little isle which doth embower XXIX ‘A home where exiled angels might forbear Awhile to mourn for Paradise.’ . . . But no! Never, how dark soe'er my fate, and drear, Shalt thou reproach me for that only woe XXX Which neither love can soothe, nor pride controul; Which dwells where duty dies: and haunts the void Of life's abandon'd purpose in the soul; The accusing ghost of what itself destroy'd. XXXI Farewell, and yet again farewell, and yet Never farewell,—if farewell mean to fare Alone and disunited. Love hath set Our days, in music, to the self-same air; XXXII And I shall feel, wherever we may be, Even though in absence and an alien clime, The shadow of the sunniness of thee, Hovering, in patience, through a clouded time. XXXIII Farewell! The dawn is rising, and the light Is making, in the east, a faint endeavour To illuminate the mountain peaks. Good night. Thine own, and only thine, my love, for ever! END OF BOOK I. BOOK II. ABSENCE. “Vado ben spesso cangiando loco Ma no so mai cangiar desio.” Salvator Rosa. THE MESSAGE. Because she hath the sweetest eyes, The bluest, truest,—and more wise Than woodland violets wild in wood To make wholesome the earth, and good; Because she hath such glad gold hair That nothing in the laughing air Of the lusty May, at morn, When all that's bright and glad is born, Ever was so glad and bright; And, therewith, a hand more white And warm than is the warmèd coat Of whiteness round a meek dove's throat, Yet withal so calm, so pure, No ill passion may endure That serenest hand's chaste touch; And because my love is such That I do not dare to speak, Of the changes on her cheek, Which the sunrise and sunset Of her luminous thoughts beget, Nor of her rose-sweet mouth, that is Too sweet to kiss, or not to kiss, 'Tis aye so sweet and savorous; And because (to comfort us For what throbbings of sweet pain Come, and go, and come again, Till the wishful sense be full, Gazing on aught so beautiful) Such innocent wise ways she knoweth, And so good is all she doeth,— All she is,—so simple, fair, Joyous, just, and debonair, That there is none so ignorant Of worship, nor with soul so scant Of visitations from above, But, seeing her, he needs must love, And purely love, her,—and for this, Love better everything that is;— Therefore now, my Songs, will I That ye into her presence hie, Flying over land and sea, Many an one, that sever me From the sweet thing that hath the sleeping Joy of my shut heart in keeping. But, that when ye hence be gone Into the bounteous region Of that bright land over sea Wherein so many sweet things be, Where my Lady aye doth dwell, Ye her dwelling dear may tell, Nor its special sweetness miss In midst of many sweetnesses; Yet awhile, my Songs, delay Till I have told ye, as I may, All the fairness of the place That is familiar with the grace And glory of my Lady's face. And (so shall ye know that she Dwelleth in loftier light than we, As intimate with skyey things As are creatures that have wings) Being come to mountains seven, Note that one that's nighest heaven: Thereon lieth against the sun A place of pleasaunce, all o'er-run With whisperous shade, and blossoming Of divers trees, wherein do sing The little birds, and all together, All day long in happy weather. And well I ween that since the birth Of Adam's firstborn, not on earth Hath ever been such sweet singing Of bird on bough, as here doth bring Into a large and leafy ease His sense that strayeth among the trees, Where mingled is full many a note Of golden-finch and speckle-throat. Even the hoarse-chested starling Here, where creepeth never a snarling Gust to vex his heart, all day Learneth a more melodious lay Than that whereby this bird is known, Which, otherwhere, with chiding tone, What time the fretful Spring doth heave The frozen North, to winds, that grieve Round about the grave of March, He chaunteth from the cloudy larch: The linnet loud, and throstle eke, And the blackbird of golden beak, With perpetual madrigals Do melodize the warm green walls Of those blossom-crownèd groves, In whose cool hearts the cooing doves Make murmurings innumerable, Of sound as sweet as when a well With noise of bubbled water leapeth At a green couch where Silence sleepeth: Nor less, the long-voiced nightingale Doth, deep down in bloomy vale Delicious, pour at full noonlight The song he hath rehearsed o'er-night; And many other birds be there Of most sweet voice, and plumage rare, And names that I not know. Of trees That spring therein such plenty is That I to tell them over all Encumber'd am. Both maple tall There showeth his silver-mottled bark; And beeches, colour'd like the dark Red wine o' the South; and laurels green, Sunny and smooth, that make rich screen Round mossy places, where all day Red squirrels and gray conies play, Munching brown nuts and such wild fare As tumbleth from the branches there. And, for moisture of sweet showers, All the grass is thick with flowers; Primrose pure, that cometh alone; Daisies quaint, with savour none, But golden eyes of great delight, That all men love, they be so bright; And, cold in grassy cloister set, Many a maiden violet; The bramble flower, the scarlet hepe, Hangeth above in sunny sleep; And all around be knots and rows Of tufted thyme, and lips of cows; Whose sweet savour goeth about The jocund bowers, in and out, And dieth over all the place; So that there is not any space Of sun or shade, but haunted is With ghosts of many sweetnesses. There, dreading no intrusive stroke Of lifted axe, the lusty oak Broad his branches brown doth fling, And reigneth, “every inch a king:” Him also of that other kind In great plenty shall ye find, That while the great year goeth around Sheddeth never his leaves to ground, But in himself his summer hath, And oweth not, nor borroweth, As (though but rare) there be some wise Good men, that to themselves suffice; But in northern land we see Full few, and they but stunted be, Of this goodly kind of tree. The ever-trembling birch, through all Her hoary lights ethereal, Doth twinkle there, twixt green and gray; And of fruit-trees is great array: The apple and the pear tree both, Smother'd o'er in creamy froth Of bubbled blossoms; the green sig, With leathern leaves, and horny twig, And gluey globes; the juniper, That smelleth sweet in midsummer; Nor peach-tree, there, nor apricot, Needeth either nail or knot; Nor there from churlish weathers wince The orange, lemon, plum, and quince; But under these, by grassy slopes, Hangeth the vine her leafy ropes; Wild Proteus she, o' the wanton wood, That ever shifteth her merry mood, And, aye in luxury of change, Loveth to revel, and dance, and range, In leaves, not hers, she sleeteth through, Hiding her large grape-bunches blue; And here, o'er haunts he maketh brown With droppings from his scented crown, Standeth the stately sycamore, Lifting airy terrace o'er Airy terrace;—such of yore Dusky masons, deftly skill'd Mighty stones to pile and build, Up-hung in sumptuous Babylon, For silken kings at set of sun To dally with dark girls; but these Are humm'd about by honey bees, And cicale all day long Creek the chamber'd shades among. Far away, down hills that seem Liquid (for the light doth stream Through and through them) like that vail Of lucid mist Morn spreadeth pale O'er Summer's sallow forehead, found Somewhere asleep on upland ground Under the shade of heavy woods, Imaginary multitudes Of melancholy olives waste Their wanness, smiling half effaced In a smooth sea of slumbrous glory; But high on inland promontory Blandly the broad-headed pine, Basking in the blue divine, Drowseth, drench'd with sunny sky: And, while the blue needle-fly Nimbly pricketh in and out The leaf-broider'd lawns about, (As busy she as highborn dame In shining silk, at tambour frame), The pomegranate, flowering flame, Burneth lone in cool retreats, Hidden from those gorgeous heats Where summer smouldereth into sweets. Now, when ye have this goodly wood All roamèd through, in gamesome mood, At morning tide, and thereon spent Large wealth of love and wonderment, In honour due of such full cheer And lustihood as laugheth here The well-bower'd grass about, That windeth in, and windeth out, Under those bright ribandings The red-budded bramble flings From branch to branch, still straying on Softly, ye shall be ware anon Of a fair garden, glad and great, Where my Lady, in high state Of beauty, doth twixt eve and noon, Under a spiritual moon, Visit full oft her vassal flowers In silent and sweet-scented hours, When quiet vast is everywhere, About the blue benignant air And the cool grass, a deep immense Gladness, an undisturbèd sense Of goodness in the gather'd calm Of old green woodlands bathed in balm, And bounteous silence. . . . O my love, How softly do the sweet hours move About thy peaceful perfectness! O hasten, little Songs! O press To meet my Lady, ye that be Her children, if she knew! . . . But she Still lingereth, and the silver dawn Is silent on the unfooted lawn. Here all day doth couch and sport Trim Flora, with her florid court: Roses that be illuminèd With royal colour rich and red; Some, with bosoms open wide, Where the brown bee, undenied, Drinketh deep of honey drops; Others, whose enamell'd knops Prettily do peep between Their half-bursten cradles green; Lordly lilies, pale and proud; And of all flowers a great crowd; Whose rare-colour'd kirtles show More hues than of the rainy bow. In sweet warmth and lucid air Nod they all and whisper, where Lightly along each leafy lane Zephyrus, with his tripping train, Cometh at cool of even hour To greet in all her pomp and power Queen Flora, when in mansions damp Of the dim moss his spousal lamp Aloof the enamour'd glow-worm doth Softly kindle; while the moth Flitteth; and, at elfin rites, Sprucely dance the little Sprites Under the young moon all alone, Round about King Oberon. But ye this pleasaunce fair shall reach Ere yet from off the slanted peach The drops of silver dew be slipp'd, Or night-born buds be open-lipp'd. There shall ye find, in lustrous shade Of laurels cool, an old well-head That whelmeth up from under-ground, And falleth with a tinkling sound In a broad basin, builded there, All rose-porphyry, smooth and fair. The water is ever fresh and new, As that Narcissus gazed into, When, for love of his sweet self, He fainted from the flowery shelf, Leaving Echo all that pain; So that now there doth remain Of him that was so fair and sweet Only in some green retreat A purple flower seldom found, And of her a hollow sound In hollow places. There shall ye Pause as ye pass, and sing . . “To thee, Water, our Master bade us say Glad be thy heart, and pure alway; May thy full urn never fail; Thee nor sun nor frost assail, Nor wild winter's wind molest thee; Never newt nor est infest thee; Taint nor trouble touch thee never; Heaven above thee smile for ever; Earth around thee ever bear Beauteous buds and blossoms rare; Far from thee be all foul things, Slaves to thee be all sweet springs, Because thou, of thy kindness, hast Shown, in blissful summers past, To fondest eyes have ever been, Sweetest face was ever seen: Therefore be blest for evermore.” But if, my Songs, ye would explore This pleasaunce all, there be therein Delights so many, day would win His under-goal ere ye were forth Of your much musing on the worth That is therein, and wondrous grace: Therefore, ere the sun down-pace, Must ye onward, where is spread A fair terrace; and overhead Thick trellis of the trembling vine, That with leaves doth loop and twine Aëry casements, whence the glance Of whoso there, as in a trance, Walketh about the whisperous shade Under that vaulted verdure laid, Seëth far down, and far away, Tower'd cities, throng'd and gay, Blowing woodlands, bright blue streams Sparkling outward, yellow gleams Of wavèd corn, and sun-burnt swells Of pasture, soothed with sounds of bells Sprinkled in air, of various tone, From little hill-side chapels lone, And peaceful flocks that stray and pass Down endless lengths of lowland grass. And, certes, I will boldly say Of this fair place, let mock who may, That of joy the quintessence Hath never slept about the sense Of mortal man that is to die With fullness sweet as that which I Deep in my solaced heart have known, Whilhom walking, not alone, Here in summer morns and eves, When shadowy showers of flittering leaves Fell, shaken thick from many a rout Of little birds that fast flew out Above us; interruption sweet To converse, felt the more complete For the interposèd pauses Born of all such innocent causes. High on the happy lawn above Standeth the dwelling of my love. Fair white all the mansion seemeth, Save where in green shadow dreameth The broad blossom-buttress'd roof, Or where the many-colour'd woof Of honeysuckle and creeping flowers, Visibly from vernal showers Winning length, hath broider'd all With braided buds the southern wall. Therein many windows be; And every window fair to see, O'er-canopied with hangings bright, For shelter fresh from summer light. And underneath, in urns and pots, Sweet-smelling basil, and red knots Of roses ripe; for every casement Is balconied about at basement, A space where three or four may sit At interchange of song or wit, In the low amber evening hours, Overlooking lawns and flowers. In the hall, which is beneath, A fountain springeth and echoeth, Blown by a sad-looking Nymph, Ravisht from her native lymph And mossy grot, in days of old; And in marble mute and cold Here for ever must she dwell Uncompanion'd, by the spell Of a stern old sculptor caught; For, aye since then, the hand that wrought This stony charm her limbs upon May not undo it. Years are gone, And still about her doth she stare, Amazed however she came there. But ye, since ye be free to rove This mansion through, to floors above Up the majestic marble stair Pass with still steps, unseen, to where Soon shall ye find, in sequel long, Twelve great chambers: some be hung With arras quaint, that doth portray Hounds that hold the hart at bay In good green wood, and hunters bold, And dames aclad in green and gold; And evermore their horns be wound, And evermore there cometh no sound: Others in glowing fresco tell Great Cæsar's tale, and how he fell Pierced through and through; with many a story Of ancient kings that be in glory, And high-renownèd heroes old; Sir Tristram, with his harp of gold, That rashly drain'd the philtre brew'd By the witch Queen for fair Isoud; Roland in Roncevallès slain; And bold Sir Ogier the Dane; Huon of Bordeaux, love's true star; Saladin with his scimitar; The Red-beard Kaiser, sleeping still Hid in the heart of Salzburg Hill; David that danceth round the ark; And Charlemagne; ye there may mark. But, O my Songs, more softly now, More softly move! Breathe low, breathe low! For, by my heart's most tender fear, I know that ye must now be near The place where, nesting meek and warm, Rosy cheek on snowy arm, With loos'd hair and lidded eye Dreaming doth my Lady lie: And all around the restful air Is silent, sweet, and pure, as where Fond hands some holy taper trim, Peaceful in sacred precincts dim. Now, that my spirit, though far away From her loved beauty, night and day Ever in unreleasèd pine Seeking, on many a musèd line, To flow toward her, purely may Her pureness praise,—humbly I pray Of all good things that wait upon The mind that maketh devotion To what is fair (since such do lean O'er mortal spirits oft unseen Out of the deep and starry night, Or steal on beams of morning light, Or breath of buds, or sound of song Remember'd, to keep safe from wrong, And wretchedness, and self-mistrust, Whatever warreth in this dust Against oblivion), that their grace May from my spirit purge and chase All that is in it not sweet and pure; So may I look with insight sure Into myself, and favour find To make a mirror within my mind, Whereon, unsoil'd of any taint Of sinful thought, my most sweet saint Her fairness may from far let fall In a deep peace perpetual. The memory of her is mellow light In darkness, mingling something bright With all things; like a summer night. The presence of her is young sunrise, That gladdeneth, and, in wondrous wise, Glorifieth, the earth and skies: Her spirit is tender and bright as dew Of May-morn fresh, when stars be few: Her heart is harmless, simple, and true, And blithe, and sweet, as bird in bower, That singeth alone from hour to hour: Her face is fair as April flower: Her voice is fresh as bubbling bound Of silver stream, in land new found, That maketh ever a pleasant sound To the soul of a thirsty traveller: Her laugh is light as grasshopper: Her breath is sweet as midsummer: Her hair is a marvellous living thing With a will of its own: the little locks fling Showers of brown gold, gambolling Over the ever-fleeting shade About her shoulder and sweet throat stray'd, With delicate odours underlaid: Like calm midsummer cloud, nor less Clothed with sweet light and silentness, She in her gracious movement is: Noble withal, and free from fear As heart of eagle, and high, and near To heaven in all her ways: of cheer Gentle, and meek, from harshness free As heart of dove: nor chideth she Things ill, but knoweth not that they be: All clear as waters clean that run Through shadow sweet, and through sweet sun, Her pure thoughts are: scorn hath she none: But in my Lady's perfect nature All is sincere, and of sweet feature. This earth hath none such other creature. Rise, little Songs, on nimble wing! Arise! arise! as larks do sing Lost in that heaven of light they love, So rise, so lose yourselves above My darkness, in the perfect light Of her that is so pure and bright! Rise, little Songs! with lusty cheer Rise up to greet my Lady dear. Be bold, and say to her with pride,— “We are the souls of loves that died; Whose sweetness is hope sorrow-fed, Whose tendernesses tears unshed; And we are essences that rise From passions burn'd in sacrifice; The youngest and bright-eyèd heirs Of blind unbeautiful despairs; Voiced resignations, once dumb wrongs.” Then, if she smile on you, my Songs, Say, as I bid you, word for word, “Lady of him that is our lord, We from his heart, where we were born, Shelter'd, and shut from shame and scorn, Now at his bidding (well-a-day For him, and us!) being fled away, Never again may there abide, Never return, and, undenied, Creep in, and fold our wings, and rest At peace in our abandon'd nest. Wherefore, dear mistress, prithee take (By true love sent, for true love's sake) To thy sweet heart, and spirit pure, Us, that must else but ill endure The scorns of time, and haply fare Homeless as birds in winter are.” But if that, on your way to greet My gracious Lady, ye should meet Haply elsewhere with other folk Who may ask ye in scorn or joke,— “Pray you now, little Songs, declare Who is that lady so sweet and fair, Whereof this singer that sent you sings, As certainly sweeter than all sweet things?” See that ye answer not, Songs, but deep In your secretest hearts my secret keep; Lest the world, that loveth me not, should tell The name of the Lady I love so well. A FOOTSTEP. Within my mind there is a garden: part Sprung from the greenest stray-aways of Spring In a dewy time: part by long labouring Of toilful Love, and many a culturing art Learn'd of skill'd Grief in patientness of heart, Nor without weariness, wrought. Deep-blossoming Growths of long-planted pain cold shadow fling, Sun-proof to every casual golden dart, Over one aspect of this haunt. Elsewhere Full sunlight sleeps for ever. Many a day I lose myself about this quiet place, Following one footstep ever the same way. Dear, 'tis thy ghostly footstep that I trace, But thee thyself I find not here nor there. DIVIDED LIVES. O lives beloved, wherein mine once did live, Thinking your thoughts, and walking in your ways, On your dear presence pasturing all my days, In pleasantness, and peace; whose moods did give The measure to mine own! how vainly strive Poor Fancy's fingers, numb'd by time, to raise This vail of woven years, that from my gaze To hide what now you are doth still contrive! Dear lives, I marvel if to you yet clings Of mine some colour; and my heart then feels Much like the ghost of one who died too young To be remember'd well, that sometimes steals A family of unsad friends among Sighing, and hears them talk of other things. SEA-SIDE ELEGIACS. Ever my heart beateth high and the blood in me danceth delighted, When, in the wind on the wharf, keen from the edge of the land, Watching the white-wingèd black-bodied ships, as they rise uninvited Over the violet-dark wall o' the waters, I stand. Wondrous with life that is in them, aware of the waters and weathers, They to the populous port pass with a will of their own. Merrily singeth the mariner there, as the cable he tethers Tight to the huge iron ring, hung in the green glewy stone. Swept with the spray is the pavement above; and the sea-wind is salt there. Down on the causeys all day, humming, the merchants unlade Marvellous merchandise, while the sea-engines of burthen, at halt there, Shoulder each other, and loll, lazy in shine or in shade. O for the wing o' the grey sea-eagle, that far away inland Croucheth in cave or in creek, waiting the wind on the height! When night cometh, the great north-wind, blowing bleak over Finland, Leapeth, and, lifting aloft, beareth him into the night. O for the wing o' the bird! and O for the wind o' the ocean! O for the far-away lands! O for the faces unfound! Would I were hence! for my spirit is fill'd with a mighty emotion. Why must the spirit, though wing'd, thus to the body be bound? Ah, but my heart sinketh low, and the rapturous vein is arrested, When, at the mid o' the night, high on the shadowy land, Mournfully watching the ghost-white waves, livid-lipp'd, hollow-breasted, Sob over shingle and shell, here with my sorrow I stand. Weary of woe that is in them, fatigued by the violent weathers, Feebly they tumble and toss, sadly they murmur and moan, Coldly the moon looketh down through the wan-rolling vapour she gathers Silently, cloud after cloud, round her companionless throne. Dark up above is the wharf; and the harbour. The night-wind alone there Goeth about in the night, humming a horrible song. Black misshapen bulks, coil'd cumbrous things, overthrown there, Seem as, in sullen dismay, silently suffering wrong. O for the wing o' the grey sea-eagle, roamer of heaven! Him doth the wind o' the night bear through the night on its breast, Over the howling ocean, and unto his ancient haven, Far in the land that he loves finding the realms of his rest. O for the wing o' the bird! and O for the wind o' the ocean! O for the lands that are left! O for the faces of eld! Would I were hence! for my spirit is fill'd with a mournful emotion. Why must the spirit, though wing'd, still by the body be held? THE SHORE. Can it be women that walk in the sea-mist, under the cliffs there Which the unsatisfied surge sucks with importunate lip? There, where out from the sand-chok'd anchors, on to the skiffs there, Twinkle the slippery ropes, swinging adip and adrip? All the place in a lurid, glimmering, emerald glory, Glares like a Titan world come back under heaven again: Yonder, aloof are the steeps of the sea-kings, famous in story; But who are they on the beach? they are neither women nor men. Who knows, are they the land's, or the water's, living creatures? Born of the boiling sea? nurst in the seething storms? With their woman's hair dishevell'd over their stern male features, Striding, bare to the knee; magnified maritime forms! They may be the mothers and wives, they may be the sisters and daughters Of men on the dark mid-seas, alone in those black coil'd hulls, That toil 'neath yon white cloud, whence the moon will rise o'er the waters To-night, with her face on fire, if the wind in the evening lulls. But they may be merely visions, such as only sick men witness, (Sitting as I sit here, fill'd with a wild regret,) Framed from the sea's misshapen spume with a horrible fitness To the winds in which they walk, and the surges by which they are wet:— Salamanders, seawolves, witches warlocks; marine monsters Which the dying seaman beholds, when the rats are swimming away, And an Indian wind 'gins hiss from an unknown isle, and alone stirs The broken cloud which burns on the verge of the dead, red day. I know not. All in my mind is confused; nor can I dissever The mould of the visible world from the shape of my thoughts in me. The Inward and Outward are fused: and, through them, murmur for ever The sorrow whose sound is the wind, and the roar of the limitless sea. THE PEDLAR. I There was a man, whom you might see At nightfall, with a pedlar's pack, Or was it an iron chest, that he Had bound upon his back? II He pass'd the tinkling camels, pass'd The wayside wells, the glimmering grates Of garden walls, the palm-trees mass'd Round Bagdadt's murmurous gates. III The merchants from Bassora stared And of his wares would question him, But, without answer, on he fared Into the evening dim. IV His cheek was worn, his back bent double Beneath the iron chest it bore, And in his walk there was the trouble Of one whose feet are sore. V You wonder'd if he ever had A settled home, a wife, a child. You marvell'd if a face so sad At any time had smiled. VI To him the pitying housewife oft Flung alms, but he limp'd heedless by; The children pelted him and scoff'd, Yet fear'd,—they knew not why. VII Thro' the dark doorway of the maid Loose from her lingering lover ran, And, with a frighten'd whisper, said ‘There walks the haunted man!’ VIII The traveller hail'd him oft ‘Goodnight! The town is far, the road is lone. God speed!’ Already out of sight The wayfarer was gone. IX But when the night was late and still, And only thro' the darkness crept The hungry wild beast from the hill, He laid him down, and slept. X His head on that strong box he laid; And there, beneath the star-clear skies, Or in the jungle's giant shade, There rose before his eyes. XI A lovely dream, a vision fair, Of some far off forgotten land, And a white girl with golden hair And wild flowers in her hand. XII He sprang to clasp her. ‘Ah, once more ‘Return, beloved, and bring with thee The glory and the grace of yore, And all that was to be!’ XIII Ere she could answer, o'er his back There fell a sharp and sudden stroke, And, smarting sore, the wretch, alack, Most wretchedly awoke. XIV There comes from out that iron chest A hideous hag, a hateful crone. With lifted crutch, and scurvey jest, She beats him to the bone. XV ‘Thou lazy scatterling! come, budge, And carry me again!’ she says. ‘Not half the journey's over. Trudge!’ He groans, but he obeys. XVI Oft in the sea he sought to fling That iron chest. But witches swim; And wave and wind were sure to bring The old hag back to him, XVII Who all the more. . . . . But, O my love, Thou know'st the rest! Thou know'st it all. Return! return! where e'er I rove, And whatsoe'er befall, XVIII I heed not, if thou still. . . . Behold, With surly crutch uplifted high The angry hag begins to scold! Ah, yet we might. . . . . Good-bye! THE VAMPIRE. I. I found a corpse, with glittering hair, Of a woman whose face, tho' dead, The white death in it had left still fair, Too fair for an earthy bed! So I loosen'd each fold of her bright curls, roll'd From forehead to foot in a gush of red gold, And kiss'd her lips till her lips were red, And warm and light on her eyelids white I breath'd, and press'd unto mine her breast, Till the blue eyes oped, and the breast grew warm. And this woman, behold! arose up bold, And, lifelike lifting a wilful arm, With steady feet from the winding sheet Stepp'd forth to a mutter'd charm. II. And now beside me, whatever betide me, This woman is, night and day. For she cleaves to me so, that, wherever I go She is with me the whole of the way. And her eyes are so bright in the dead of the night. That they keep me awake with dread; While my lifeblood pales in my veins, and fails, Because her red lips are so red That I fear 'tis my heart she must eat for her food; And it makes my whole flesh creep To think she is drinking and draining my blood, Unawares, if I chance to sleep. III. It were better for me, ere I came nigh her,— This corpse,—ere I look'd upon her,— Had they burn'd my body in penal fire With a sorcerer's dishonour. For, when the Devil hath made his lair In the living eyes of a dear dead woman, (To bind a man's strength by her golden hair, And break his heart, if his heart be human) Is there any penance, or any prayer, That may save the sinner whose soul he tries To catch in the curse of the constant stare Of those heartbreaking bewildering eyes,— Comfortless, cavernous glowworms that glare From the gaping grave where a dead hope lies? It is more than the soul of a man may bear. For the misery worst of all miseries Is Desire eternally feeding Despair On the flesh, or the blood, that forever supplies Life more than enough to keep fresh in repair The death ever dying, which yet never dies. A REPROACH. I. Fierce the sea is, and fickle if fair. So they say of it. So let it be! But did ever the landsman's languor check The seaman's pride in his dancing deck? Or did ever the helmsman, whose home is there, In place of his own true hand and eye Trust the ploughman's skill, when the sea ran high, And submit to a landsman's usurpature? No! for the seaman loveth the sea, And knoweth its nature. II. Peril there is on the mountain peak, When headlong tumble the turbulent rills. But did ever the lowland shepherd's fear Daunt the heart of the mountaineer? Or did ever the hillborn hunter seek, When the snowdrift, sweeping the mountain side, Flew fast and fierce, for a lowland guide To track the path of a mountain creature? No! for the huntsman loveth the hills, And knoweth their nature. III. Then to whom shall the sailor for counsel go, Thro' the violent waters his bark to steer? Or what thro' the ice and the falling snow May guide the foot of the mountaineer? Hath the huntsman heed of the pastoral quills Which the shepherd pipes to his flocks on the lea? Or the seaman faith in the fear that fills The babbling landsman's prate? Not he! For the heighths and the depths have their ways and wills, Which they must learn who their lords would be. And the highlander studies and trusts the hills, As the mariner studies and trusts the sea. IV. But, O my love, I am thine in vain, If thou trustest me not! and oh why hast thou ta'en Counsel, not of my nature nor thine, How a woman should deal with this heart of mine? The seaman the sea doth trust, And the huntsman the hills. But thou, Thou, that hast known me, do'st Trust those that I scorn to know For the knowledge of me; Who have been thine own In vain, if by thee I be still unknown. A REMONSTRANCE. I Deem, if thou wilt, that I am all, and worse Than all, they bid thee deem that I must be. But, ah! wilt thou desert love's universe, Deserting me? II Not for my sake, be mine unworth forgiven, But for thine own. Since I, despite my dearth Of all that made thee, what thou art, my Heaven, Am still thine Earth; III Still thy love's only habitable star; Whose element engender'd, and embosoms All thoughts, all feelings, all desires, which are Love's roots and blossoms. IV Who will hold dear the ashes of the days Burn'd out on altars deem'd no more divine? Rests there of thy soul's wealth enough to raise A new god's shrine? V Who will forgive thy cheek its faded bloom, Save he whose kisses that blanch'd rose hath fed? Thine eyes, the stain of tears—save he for whom Those tears were shed? VI Despite the blemisht beauty of thy brow, Thou would'st be lovely couldst thou love again; For love renews the beautiful. But thou Hast only pain. VII How wilt thou bear from pity to implore What once thy power from rapture could command? How wilt thou stretch—who wast a Queen of yore— A suppliant's hand?— VIII Even of thy pride be poor enough to ask Love's purchased shelter, charitably chill, Yet hast thou strength to recommence the task Of pardoning still? IX For who will prize in thee love's loss of all Love hath to give save pardon for love wrong'd, Unless that pardon be, whate'er befall Love's pride, prolong'd? X And thou—to whom demanding all that I Can claim no more, wilt thou henceforth extend Forgiveness on forgiveness, with that sigh Which shuns the end? XI Where wilt thou find the unworthier lips than mine, To plead for pardon with a prayer more lowly? To whom else, pardoning much, become divine By pardoning wholly?— XII Ah, if thy heart can pardon yet, why yet Should not its latest pardon be for me? And, if thou wilt not pardon, canst thou set The future free XIII From the unpardon'd past, and so forget me? If not,—forgive me for thine own sad sake; Else, having left me, thou would'st still regret me, And still would'st take XIV Revenge for that regret on thine own bosom, Revenge on others for the failure, found In them, to rear transplanted love to blossom On blighted ground. XV As lion, tho' by lion wounded, still Doth miss the boisterous pastime of his kind, Or wild sea-eagle, tho' with broken quill, Clipt, and confined, XVI And fed on dainty fare among the doves, Doth miss the stormy sea-wind and the brine, So would'st thou miss, amid all worthier loves, The unworth of mine. XVII Then, if the flush of love's first faith be wan, And thou wilt love again, again love me, For what I am—no Saint, but still a man That worships thee.— ONE MORNING. I “Swear twice, and thrice, no future hour Shall ever blight what this hath blest! Nay, I possess thee by the power Whereby I am, myself, possest!” II Words like to those were said (—or dream'd?—) How long since! on a night divine, By lips from which such rapture stream'd, I cannot think those lips were mine. III The dawn creeps, dripping, up the roofs, All sallow from a night of rain. The sound of feet, and wheels, and hoofs In the choked street begins again. IV The same dull toil—no end, no aim! The same vile babble in mine ears: The same unmeaning smiles: the same Most miserable dearth of tears: V The same sick gaze on the same lack Of lustre in the level grey: It seems like yesterday come back With nothing new, and not today. VI But, now and then, her name will fall From careless lips, with little praise, On life's parcht surface, shattering all The dry indifference of my days. VII The chatterers chatter here and there: They chatter of they know not what: They lie, and leer, and sneer, and stare, Inquire of this, and hint of that. VIII On her fair fame, and mine, the spite Of fools is fed. They know not, they, (No more than insects when they bite) The nature of their noble prey. IX This curse ensues, when life from life Hath been disjoin'd,—that things which breed And buzz in broken rifts their rise And reeking eggs, 'twixt dust and weed, X Hatch in the hollow fractures fast; And so defile their delicate Fine fibrous joints that these at last Can fit and fix no more. Such fate XI Is ours, unless thou sweep from thine, As I from my life hourly sweep, The sickening swarm and strangling twine Of weeds that cling and worms that creep, XII O thou, so distant and so dear Half of us One! But, ah! the worst Is that I know she cannot hear. This warning cry. And lips that thirst XIII Drink aught that's pour'd: and souls o'erstrung Are credulous of cause for pain: And she is left alone among My slanderers: and a Lie will gain XIV The goal, altho' from land to land, To get there, round the world it run, White Truth, half-waked, with drowsy hand Her travelling trim is buckling on. XV I know how tender friends of ours Have sown, 'twixt crafty gape and glance, The seeds of scandal's choicest flowers, That seem, like weeds, to spring from chance. XVI That small, small, imperceptible Small talk! that cuts like powder'd glass Ground in Tophana,—who can tell Where lurks the power the poison has? XVII All treachery could devise hath wrought Against us—letters robb'd and read, Snares hid in smiles, betrayal bought, And lies imputed to the dead. XVIII And here, where Slander's spawn is spilt, And gabbling Gossip clucks above Her fetid eggs, it feels like guilt, To know that, far away, my love XIX Her heart on every heartless hour Is haply bruising for my sake, While numb, and dumb, and void of power, My life sleeps, like a winter snake. XX I will arise, and go to her, And save her, in her own despite. For in my breast begins to stir A pulse of its old power and might. XXI I may be worse than friends would prove. Who knows the worst of any man? But, whatsoe'er it be, my love Is not what they conceive, or can. XXII Nor can they so have slander'd me But what, I think, if I should call, And stretch my arms to her, that she Would rush to meet me, 'spite of all. SORCERY. I. You're a Princess of the water: I'm a Genius of the air. We have both been metamorphosed, But our spirits still are fair. For a deed, untold, unwritten, That was done an age ago, I have lost my wings, and wander In the wilderness below. For a wizard's wicked pleasure, In a palace by the sea, You were changed to a white panther, Till the time for meeting me. No white lamb are you, my panther, And no shepherd swain am I! Did you hear the wild horn blowing, When I heard the wild beast cry? You have lain, with lynx and lion, In the jungle and the fen. I have roam'd the wild with robbers, Pariahs, outlaws, ruin'd men. The black elephants of Delhi Are the wisest of their kind, And the libbards of Sumatra Have a hundred eyes behind: But they guess'd not, they divined not, They believed me of the earth, When I moved among them, mourning For the region of my birth, Till I found you in the moonlight. Then, at once, I knew it all! You were coil'd in sullen slumber, But you started at my call. To my lips your name came leaping When you open'd your wild eyes. At my feet you fawn'd, you knew me In despite of all disguise. Sure I am why in your slumber You were moaning! 'Twas for me, And a dream of harpers harping From a palace by the sea. Thro' the wilderness together We must wander everywhere, Till we find the magic berry That shall make us what we were. Then your crown shall you recover, And my wings shall I regain, And we two shall then reenter Our inherited domain. 'Tis a fruit of bitter savour, By few pilgrims sought or found: And the palm whence we must pluck it Grows on far enchanted ground. Bitter is it, yet benignant, Since of power to cleanse and cure; Like the godhood of the Ganges Purifying things impure. By its virtue, if we find it, Shall our forms again be fair: Yours, with beauty of the water, Mine, with beauty of the air. All the ways are wild before us, And the night is in the skies, And the dæmons of the desert Are against us. Yet arise! END OF BOOK II. BOOK III. THE LAST TIME. “Qual mio destin, qual forza o qual inganno Mi reconduce disarmato al campo Là 've sempre son vinto?” Petrarca, Sonnet CLXVI. EARTH'S HAVINGS. (Song.) Weary the cloud falleth out of the sky, Dreary the leaf lieth low. All things must come to the earth by and by, Out of which all things grow. Let the wild wind laugh and whistle Aloof in the lonesome wood: In our garden let the thistle Start where the rosetree stood: Let the rotting moss fall rotten With the raindrops from the eaves: Let the dead past lie forgotten In his grave with the yellow leaves. Weary the cloud falleth out of the sky, Dreary the leaf lieth low. All things must come to the earth by and by, Out of which all things grow. And again the hawthorn pale Shall blossom sweet i' the Spring: And again the nightingale In the deep blue nights shall sing: And seas of the wind shall wave In the light of the golden grain: But the love that is gone to his grave Shall never return again. Weary the cloud falleth out of the sky, Dreary the leaf lieth low. All things must come to the earth by and by, Out of which all things grow. FUTILITY. I Let us not be dissatisfied With Nature. She is in her right. We are ourselves, and nought beside. As, on a clear spring night, II The cold encumbrance of the snow Drops from the bosom of the hills, So all my life from thine lets go, And all its weight of ills III Drops from thee. Set thy smooth smile free, Assert thy youth, bloom forth unblamed Beyond me! Whatsoe'er we be, Why should we be ashamed? IV That which we are, we are. 'Twere vain To plant with toil what may not blow. The cloud will break and bring the rain, Whether we reap, or sow. V All finds its place. We shall not miss Life's meaning, whatsoe'er it mean. If this were that, or that were this, What hath been had not been. VI Let all be as it is, dear love. There is no better thing than sleep. They only fall, that strive to move, Or lose, that care to keep. VII Let go what will not stay. What then? Seed-time, and harvest,—soon, the snow! Above the graves of buried men The grass hath leave to grow. THE CANTICLE OF LOVE. I I heard an angel in the midnight sky, That made sweet singing to a golden lute. The pole star, and the planets seven, and I To his sweet singing did give audience mute; Which, heard, made all things else to seem most sweet, Such rapture was in those divine lute strings! Such rapture, that Heaven's seraphs, about his feet, Thrill'd to the bright ends of their burning wings. ‘The song he singeth,’ sigh'd those seraphs fair, ‘Is Love.’ But I have heard that song elsewhere. II For when I last was in the nethermost Hell, There, on a sulphurous headland wild, I heard A spirit pale that, to a hollow shell, The selfsame song was singing, word for word; Which then so sadly sounded, its sad sound Hell's aching heart did heave to deeper pain, While fiends, with foreheads scarr'd, that crouch'd around Drooping dark wings, made murmur . . . ‘Vain, ah, vain!’ Yet, moan'd those fiends ‘The song he singeth there Is Love!’ But he that sung it was Despair.— THE LAST FAREWELL. I Away! away! in those wild eyes Repress the tears whose right is o'er To flow for me. Wrung hands, and sighs, And self-rebukes can not restore What is no more. II Vain are all words, all weepings vain! We met too soon: we part too late. Still wear, as best thou canst, the chain Thine own hands forged about thy fate, Who could'st not wait. III Be happy! Haunt where music plays, And find no pain in music's tone. Be fair! Nor blush when others praise That beauty, scarcely now thine own. What's done is done. IV Take, if thou can'st, from off thy youth The mark of mine, which burns there yet. Take from that unremembering mouth The seal which there mine own hath set. And so, forget, V Tho' unforgot! It is thy doom To bear henceforth the heavy weight Of my forgiveness to the tomb. I cannot save thee from thy fate; Nor reinstate VI Thy ruin'd pride, till in my grave Love's broken bond shall buried be. And I, that would have died to save Thy heart's lost freedom, may not free This load from thee. VII Farewell, till life's mistake is over! When downward doth thy Genius turn His wasted torch, and half uncover The date upon the funeral urn, I will return. VIII Then in the dark, the doubt, the fear, Amid the Spirits come to take thee, Shall mine to thine again be near, And life's forgiveness mine shall make thee, When death doth wake thee. THE LAST ASSURANCE. I Fear me no more. The last wild words are spoken. What heart have I, who worship'd once, to blame, thee? Never shall word or deed of mine betoken The bond 'twixt thee and me which thou hast broken. In the lone years to come my lips shall name thee Never, child, never! II And, if unprized applause, or scorn'd aspersion Should waft mine own name to thine ears again, Know I have triumph'd,—not by thine exertion, Or fail'd,—but not from thy forgiven desertion. For every link is lost between us twain, Forever, child, forever! THE DESERTED PALACE. I Broken are the Palace windows, Rotting is the Palace floor. And the damp wind thro' the arras Sighs, and swings the creaking door. But it only starts the white owl Perch'd upon a monarch's throne, And the hungry rat that's gnawing Harpstrings tuneless every one. II Dare you linger here at nightfall, When the hornèd owls do shout, And the bat, the newt, the viper, And the dead men's ghosts come out? Peep not, curious fool! nor enter Here where nobler things have been. Lest you find a Phantom, sitting Throned where sat, long since, a Queen. THE BURIED HEART. This heart, you would not have, I laid up in a grave Of song: with love enwound it, And set wild fancies blowing round it. Then I to others gave it; Because you would not have it. ‘See you keep it well,’ I said, ‘This heart's sleeping—is not dead— But will wake some future day. Keep and guard it while you may.’ All great Sorrows,—sceptred some, With gold crowns upon their heads, Others that bare-footed roam, Sadly telling cypress beads, Pilgrims with no settled home, Poorly clad in Palmer's weeds, These from dismal dongeons come, Faint and wan for want of food, Those by many a bitter dart From lost battlefields pursued, —Each one clad in his own mood, Each one claiming his own part,— A forlorn and famisht brood,— Came to take my heart. Then, in holy ground they set it, With melodious weepings wet it, And revered it, as they found it, With wild fancies blowing round it. And this heart (you would not have) Being not dead, though in the grave, Work'd miracles and marvels strange, And heal'd many maladies: Giving sight to seal'd-up eyes, And legs to lame men sick for change. The fame of it grew great and greater. Then did you bethink you, later, ‘How hath this heart, I would not take, —This weak heart, a child might break— Such glory gotten? Me he gave it: Mine this heart, and I will have it.’ Ah, too late! For crowds exclaim'd ‘Ours 'tis now: and hath been claim'd. Moreover, where it lies, the spot Is holy ground: so enter not. None but men of mournful mind— Men to darken'd days resign'd; Equal scorn of Saint and Devil; Poor and outcast; halt and blind; Exiles from Life's golden revel; Gnawing at the bitter rind Of old griefs; or else, confined In proud cares, to serve and grind— May enter: whom this heart shall cure. But go thou by: thou art not poor: Nor defrauded of thy lot. Bless thyself: but enter not!’ HOW THESE SONGS WERE MADE. I I sat low down, at midnight, in a vale Mysterious with the silence of blue pines: White-cloven by a snaky river-tail, Uncoil'd from tangled wefts of silver twines. II Out of a crumbling castle, on a spike Of splinter'd rock, a mile of changeless shade Gorged half the landscape. Down a dismal dyke Of black hills the sluiced moonbeams stream'd, and staid. III I pluck'd blue mugwort, livid mandrakes, balls Of blossom'd nightshade, heads of hemlock, long White grasses, grown by mountain pedestals, To make ingredients fit, for many a song IV Of fragrant sadness,—to embalm the Past— The corpse-cold Past—that it should not decay; But in dark vaults of Memory, to the last, Endure unchanged: for in some future day V I will bring my new love to look at it (Laying aside her gay robes for a moment) That, seeing what love came to, she may sit Silent awhile, and muse, but make no comment. END OF BOOK III. BOOK IV. EXILE. “Nessun maggior dolore Che ricordarsi del tempo felice Nella miseria.” Dante, l'Inferno, Canto V. ON THE SEA. Come! breathe thou soft, or blow thou bold, Thy coming be it kind or cold, Thou soul of the heedless ocean wind,— Little I rede, and little I reck, Tho' the mast be snapp'd, and the dripping deck Swept bare of whatever the billow can find, If only thou wilt but blow from me, And bury in yonder boiling sea, This weight on my heart and mind!— Welcome, you blasts that round me roar! Welcome you hissing heaps of wave, Whose heavy heads and shoulders hoar Are now a mountain, and now a cave, And now a foam-fleckt slumbrous floor Of seething scum! True hearts, and brave, Courage! The broad sea darkens before, And the black storm follows us fast behind. The day is dead in his dismal grave. His dirge is chaunted by wave and wind. We are rid at last of the hated shore, Out of the reach of coward and slave, And free of all bonds that bind. Comrades, the night is long. I will sing you an ancient song Of a tale that was told In the days of old, Of a Baron brave and strong, ‘Who left his castled home, When the cross was raised in Rome, And swore on his sword To fight for the Lord, And the banners of Christendom. To die or to overcome! In hauberk of mail, and helmet of steel, And armour of proof from head to heel, Oh, where the foe that shall make him reel? True knight on whose crest the cross doth shine! They buckled his harness, brought him his steed— A stallion black of the land's best breed— Belted his spurs, and bade him God-speed 'Mid the Paynim in Palestine. But the wife that he loved, when she pour'd him up A last deep health in her golden cup, Put poison into the wine. ‘So he rode till the land he loved grew dim, And that poison began to work in him,— Blithely chaunting his battle hymn; And proudly tossing his noble crest; Glad of the deeds to be done in the east, And glad of the glory he goeth to win: With his young wife's pictured beauty prest To its treasured place on his harness'd breast, And her poison'd wine within. ‘Alas! poor knight, poor knight! For he carries the foe he cannot fight In his own true breast shut up. He hath pledged his life To a faithless wife, In the wine of a poison'd cup!’ Comrade, thy hand in mine! While all is dark on the brine, Pour me, no stinted flow Of that fullhearted wine Whose purple grape was aglow, Ere my sire was born, or thine, With a thousand fancies fine. My friend, I care not now If the wild night-wind should blow Our bark beyond the poles:— To drift thro' fire or snow, Out of reach of all we know— Cold heart, and narrow brow, Smooth faces, sordid souls! Lost, like some pale crew Of Ophir's trading galleys, On a witch's island! who Wander the tamarisk alleys, Where the heaven is blue, And the soft sea too, That murmurs among the valleys. ‘Perisht with all on board!’ So runs the vagrant fame— Thy wife weds another lord, My kinsmen forget my name, While we wander out of sight, Till the beard on the chin is white, And scant are the curls on the head. One dreams on poppy flowers, Strewn for the bridal bed Of some young witch: with showers Of milkwhite manna, shed Thro' dim enchanted bowers, His drowsy lips are fed. With ruin'd gods one dwells, In caverns among the fells, Where the lion and lynx lie dead, And a single shadow tells The reason why,—outspread By the upas, dark and dread, O'er the horrible silence of sultry dells In Elephanta, the Red. VENICE. The sylphs and ondines And the seakings and queens Once, on the waves built a wonderful a city, As lovely as seems To some bard, in his dreams, The soul of his sweetest love-ditty. Long ago! long ago! ah, that was long ago!— Thick, as on chalices Kings keep for treasure, Jewel-born lustres, Temples and palaces, Places of pleasure, Glitter'd in clustres; Night broke out shining With splendour and festival O'er the meandering murmurous streets, Seawaves went pining With love thro' the musical Multiform bridges and marble retreats Of this city of wonder, where dwelt the ondines Long ago, and the sylphs, and the seakings and queens. Ah, that was long ago!— But the sylphs and ondines, And the seakings and queens Are fled under the waves. And I glide, unespied, Down the glimmering tide, ('Mid forms silently passing, as silent as any!) Here in the waves Of this city of graves To bury my heart,—one grave more to the many!— RINALDO RINALDI. I. It is midnight, and moonlight, and music Abroad on the odorous air. Out of diamonded darknesses flashing, The oars of the fleet gondolier Flit over the somnolent water, And pause by the porphyry pier, In the light on the wave that is washing The weed-strewn slippery stair; Whereby to the rose-redden'd terrace Many a gay cavalier Leads many a laughing lady, Under luminous lattices there. Like the upthrust stems, bright-budded, Of some wonderful water-plant, Or a cluster of turban'd toadstools, By the pier of the palace slant All manner of brilliant-banded Purple and scarlet poles; And the gondolas tether'd to them Glitter in gorgeous shoals. 'Tis a terrace paven mosaic, And mantled with myrtle and rose; Round an ancient Venetian palace All vivid with glory that flows From lamplets of complicate colour, In clustres, and crescents, and rows; Whose splendour is spray'd by the jewels That sparkle on coronall'd brows. To the moon of the midsummer weather, That low in the warm air hovers, From the lamplit garden-grove The nightingales warble together, Delighting the souls of young lovers In many a wanton alcove. It is night in the city of pleasure, Sweet night in the season of love; And as, sway'd by a musical measure, The jubilant multitudes move, Love throbs in the nightingales' throats, That warble what words cannot tell; Love beams from the beautiful moon; Love swims in the languerous glances Of the dancers adown the dim dances; And thrills in the tremulous notes That rise into rapture, and swell From viol, and flute, and bassoon. II. The terminal tree on the terrace Is a sable cypress tree; And the statue that gleams beneath it Mnemosyne's statue must be. To the palace a guest unbidden Doth a black-stoled gondola bear, And the count Rinaldo Rinaldi Hath mounted the marble stair. In camlet cloak (not merrily Mantled, befitting a feast) And doublet of sad-colour'd quilt, Steel giaco, and dark plume, drest, Slowly he walk'd, and warily, Unlike a greeted guest, Grasping his good sword's hilt, And hiding the mail on his breast, And gazing before him drearily, —Eagerly, and yet wearily, Like one who, with bosom opprest Either by grief or guilt, Seeth, before him, the crest Of a city for refuge built, And yearneth and sigheth for rest, Yet knoweth his wish is unblest, And, foreseeing his blood will be spilt, Is resolved to die fighting at least. III. There rustled a robe in the roses, Unheard by the revellers there; For the sound of the mighty music Was strong on the midnight air. There rustled a robe, no louder Than if a light bird it were; And, under the sable shadow Of the terminal cypress tree, By the image that, gleaming thro' it, Mnemosyne's image must be, The lady Irene Riario Lean'd from the terrace her fair Face, with the midsummer moonlight Clear on her coronall'd hair. The revel ripens and ripples: The minstrels urge it and rouse. The music is sounding, the dancers bounding, Silken mummers and masks surrounding The radiant resonant house. “Siora,” the Count said unto her, “The shafts of ill fortune pursue me. Growing older, it ever grows newer, The grief of the olden time; And the foes that have sworn to undo me Have chased me from clime to clime. False foemen! never my falchion Could they shatter in open fight; But they dug their pits in the darkness, And they spread their snares on the night: My heart they have well-nigh broken, And my life they have broken quite. Yet dying men have arisen 'Neath the stroke of the slayer's knife, And slaves from the chain and the prison Have rush'd, and reconquer'd life, In the heat of a hope rekindled By the steel-cold stab of despair; For mighty in misery even Is man's worship of one thing fair. To others be all that you are, love. —A lady more lovely than most; To me be the one spared star, love, That lights to his haven the lost: A shrine that, for tender devotion, In the desert wan marriners deck With the garments yet dripping from ocean And the last jewel saved from the wreck!” IV. What the lady Irene Riario (By Mnemosyne's statue, that shone Thro' the shade of the cypress tree) To the Count Rinaldo Rinaldi Replied then, it never was known, And known now it never will be. But the moon is set; and the dawning Of day, in the starless heaven, Over the dead night hovers, Like the dead night's ghost unshriven; From the lattices no light gleams; From the porch, with its purple awning, From the garden's myrtle covers, From the pier where the water, driven 'Twixt the slant poles, blushes and gleams, The minstrels, and maskers, and mummers Are gone like the leaves of lost summers; The dancing dames, and even The last of the lingering lovers, Have flitted away; and it seems As tho' that revel had only been The brief fantastic pageant seen By a sick man, whom some morphian cup, For fever-wasted lips fill'd up, Hath mock'd with gorgeous dreams. V. Alone, Rinaldo Rinaldi Stood in the sable shade Over Mnemosyne's image By that terminal cypress made. Silent and dark was the garden; Silent, beneath, and bare, The sad wide street of wan water, With but one black gondola there. The heavens were changing above him: The dawn came chill on the air, And, darkening the cypress darker, Whiten'd the wakeful skies. He drew from his bosom a kerchief. “Would,” he sigh'd, “that her face were less fair!” And, folding the kerchief, he cover'd Mnemosyne's marble eyes.— THE PORTRAIT. The man who told this tale is not Either you, or I, good friend; Who may therefore, glad of our better lot, Hear his story told to the end. I Midnight past! Not a sound of aught Thro' the silent house, but the wind at his prayers. I sat by the dying fire, and thought Of the dear dead woman upstairs. II A night of tears! for the gusty rain Had ceased, but the eaves were dripping yet; And the moon look'd forth, as tho' in pain, With her face all white and wet: III Nobody with me, my watch to keep, But the friend of my bosom, the man I love: And grief had sent him fast to sleep In the chamber up above. IV Nobody else, in the country place All round, that knew of my loss beside, But the good young Priest with the Raphael-face, Who confess'd her when she died. V That good young Priest is of gentle nerve, And my grief had moved him beyond controul; For his lip grew white, as I could observe, When he speeded her parting soul. VI I sat by the dreary hearth alone: I thought of the pleasant days of yore: I said “the staff of my life is gone: The woman I love is no more. VII “Gem-clasp'd, on her bosom my portrait lies, Which next to her heart she used to wear— It is steep'd in the light of her loving eyes, And the sweets of her bosom and hair.” VIII And I said—“the thing is precious to me: They will bury her soon in the churchyard clay; It lies on her heart, and lost must be, If I do not take it away.” IX I lighted my lamp at the dying flame, And crept up the stairs that creak'd for fright, Till into the chamber of death I came, Where she lay all in white. X The moon shone over her winding sheet. There, stark she lay on her carven bed: Seven burning tapers about her feet, And seven about her head. XI As I stretch'd my hand, I held my breath; I turn'd, as I drew the curtains apart: I dared not look on the face of death: I knew where to find her heart. XII I thought, at first, as my touch fell there, It had warm'd that heart to life, with love; For the thing I touch'd was warm, I swear, And I could feel it move. XIII 'Twas the hand of a man, that was moving slow O'er the heart of the dead,—from the other side: And at once the sweat broke over my brow, “Who is robbing the corpse?” I cried. XIV Opposite me, by the tapers' light, The friend of my bosom, the man I loved, Stood over the corpse, and all as white, And neither of us moved. XV “What do you here, my friend?” . . . The man Look'd first at me, and then at the dead. “There is a portrait here. . .” he began; “There is. It is mine,” I said. XVI Said the friend of my bosom, “yours, no doubt, The portrait was, till a month ago, When this suffering angel took that out, And placed mine there, I know.” XVII “This woman, she loved me well,” said I. “A month ago,” said my friend to me: “And in your throat,” I groan'd, “you lie!” He answer'd. . . “let us see.” XVIII “Enough!” I return'd, “let the dead decide: And whose soever the portrait prove, His shall it be, when the cause is tried, Where Death is arraign'd by Love.” XIX We found the portrait there, in its place: We open'd it by the tapers' shine: The gems were all unchanged: the face Was—neither his nor mine. XX “One nail drives out another, at least! The portrait is not ours,” I cried, “But our friend's, the Raphael-faced young Priest, Who confess'd her when she died.” THE CASTLE OF KING MACBETH. I This is the castle of King Macbeth. And here he feasts, when the daylight wanes, And the moon is abroad o'er the blasted heath, His earls and thanes. II A hundred harpers, with harps of gold, Harp thorough the night high festival: And the revelling music thereof is roll'd From hall to hall, III While the wassailers shout till the rafters rock O'er the ringing board: and their shout is borne To the courts outside where the crowing cock Is waked ere morn. IV But there is one room of that castle old, In a cobwebb'd turret,—a dismal room, For in it a corpse sits crown'd and cold. There are four know whom. V One of those four the king must be: But the secret is his, and he keepeth it well. The others that know are the witches three: But they are in hell. MYSTERY. I. The hour was one of mystery, When we were sailing, she and I, Down the dark, the silent, stream. The stars above were dim with love; And the wandering airs beneath Did from odorous woodlands breathe Faint as when light whispers move Fresh-kist lips, whose sighs betray Whither wishful fancies stray Thro' a slumbering maiden's dream; While round and round the night we wound, Till we came, at last, to the Isle of Fays. And all the while from the faëry isle That music, that music of other days! II. It was the mellow midst of June. And the sudden silent moon Rising (as our bark we left On the bank) from out a cleft In a piney mountain, beam'd First red, then wondrous white. A goblin glory gleam'd From the Palace; and, with that light, The sound of the viols stream'd Thro' the casements over the night. We saw the dancers pass At the casements, two by two. The dew was in the grass, And the glow-worm in the dew. III. We came to the Palace. We mounted the stair. The great hall-doors wide open were. And all the dancers that danced in that hall Greeted us to the festival. Only, each noble cavalier Had his throat red-lined from ear to ear: 'Twas a collar of merit, I have heard, Which a queen upon each had once conferr'd: And each of the lovely ladies there, With subtle eyes and floating hair, Whenever she laugh'd, or smiled, let slip What seem'd to me the shadowy tip Of a little mouse's tail, that stirr'd In the dimpling warmth of a wanton lip. A mist of magical splendour lay Along the opiate air; and, thro' The rosy light of the languerous haze, Forth from the deep-toned orchestra Came flowing, heavy with sounds I knew, That music of other days. IV. My arm enlaced her winsome waist, And down the dance we two, Wound in one, with locks undone And mingled footsteps, flew. But, in the midst of the melody, Low at mine ear I heard her sigh, And paler her bright cheek grew. “What aileth thee?” Low moan made she, “The roof will fall tonight on this hall! Already the rafters are reeling above. But the outside air is quiet and fair. Lead me into the grove.” V. We wander'd into the grove. We found A bower by woodbine woven round. The music made a mellower sound. Her long hair gamboll'd glittering Over her scarlet, green, and violet vesture In a cataract of amber light; And the moon's magnificence did cling Close about her, like a glorious clothing. All at once, a sudden snowy gesture Of her white hand flash'd upon my sight, Much against my will, the golden ring; Which, meanwhile, I had forgotten quite; Else, it might have mingled love with loathing. VI. Then I said “O beauty bounteous fair! “The abundant brightness of thine hair. Never seem'd more bountifully bright. The moon is fair, and the sweet air Is sighing with excess of fond delight. Here let us, therefore, stay, till the star of the dawning day Gives warning to the watchers of the night That the world is aware, and they Who have secrets to hide from a world grown grey Must hasten out of sight.” VII. “That may not be,” she answer'd me, “For I was lately wed With this gold ring to an Ogre King. My husband is old,” she said, “Old and grey; therefore all day My little harp I softly play, Playing to him, till his eyes wax dim, And he calls for his posset cup. But into the brewage I pour A juice which he drinks thirstily up And sleeps till the night is o'er. Then, finger on lip, away I slip, And down the hills till I reach the stream. I call to thee clear till the boat appear, And we sail together thro' dark and dream. But, if he should wake and not find me, Over brook, thoro' brake, and by turret and tree, He will follow me fast, and find us at last, Bursting into the woodbine bower. For, tho' woven well, neither charm nor spell In the presence of him hath power. The shy fays and elves can take care of themselves: For the island is theirs, and they know That, for their sweet sakes, the forests and brakes Will hide them from every foe: And little heed of what may befall Have the knights who are dancing in yonder hall, For, with or without their heads,—(they all Carry them loose, and carry them so Never for use, but only for show, Since what heads they had once they have lost long ago) Each, as fast as he may, well to horse and away Over brook and bramble and stone; And each dame of the house Hath a little dun mouse That will whisper her when to be gone, (For never yet was there any device Crafty enough to catch those little mice; They have play'd their pranks so oft ere now That they are wary, and full well know How to look after their own) But we, ah love, in the trampled grove We shall be left alone, Follow'd and found by the fate we fled, Trapp'd and caught by the curse we dread, And by our own doing undone!” V. I stood up in the strong moonshine, And both her hands I held in mine. I held them fast, she could not stir, And bitterly I cried to her “Look in my face. My cheek is white, My back is bow'd, before the time, From plucking magic herbs by night, And weaving many a wizard rhyme, And all for thee! yet all in vain The wizard's wondrous art is mine, Tho' over subtle spirits I reign, And starry genii half divine, If one brute fact in flesh and blood,— All body with no soul,—hath power, Even in the haunted solitude Of this elf-builded woodbine bower, To bar my will, and blast my bliss, And make thee, what thou would'st not be, —Not mine whom thou hast sought, but his From whom my spells have rescued thee.” I loosed her hands. She did not stir. The moonlight flow'd 'twixt me and her, And, where the moonlight bathed the ground, A lute, with loveknots gaily bound, Left in the woodbine bower I found. I seized the lute, and struck the chords: With music wild I mix'd wild words: Down at her feet my limbs I flung, And, looking under her eyelids, sung “Sigh no more! try no more So to fight with fate, sweet! Error went too fast before, Caution comes too late, sweet. Grief is making up her store: We may let her wait, sweet. Sigh no more! I no more May avert, nor thou restore What's to come and what is o'er, Be it love or hate, sweet.” IX. Like the slow soft settling down Over earth and over heaven Of a southern summer even, Dark, with trembling starlight strown, Slowly, slowly over me Warm delicious darkness grew; Not unlit,—for I could see Eyes love-languid beaming thro' That sweet darkness. Then I threw Mine arms (to slake a spirit's drowth) All around it, and down-drew Brows, and breast, and breathing mouth, Till their mingled sweetness stoop'd, Pausing on me, and we droop'd And sunk together,—drooping sinking Whither? Ah, there was no thinking Then, and now there is no knowing Whither! but by sweet swift ways Downward ever; and all the while Round about us, flowing, flowing, From the flutes and lutes of the elves and fays, Out of the midst of the moonlit isle That music of other days! X. Oh, if it were but a dream of the night, A dream that I dream'd in sleep, Then why is my cheek so woeful white, And this wound in my heart so deep? And, if it were but a dream, it broke Too soon, albeit too late I awoke, Waked by the smart of a sudden stroke Which hath stunn'd me so, and stupified, That I cannot remember, nor ever shall, What was the close of that festival, Nor when from out of their wizard hall Fled the knights and the dames and the dancers all. One thing only methinks I know, And that is the weight of an Ogre's blow. Yet still at times I seem to hear Chaunted, perchance, by elves and fays, But mixt with the moan of a dismal tide That washes an island desert and drear Where a house hath fallen, and some one hath died, Faintly, fitfully floating near Along the lonesome and leafless ways, That maddening music of other days. GOING BACK AGAIN. I I dream'd that I walk'd in Italy, When the day was going down, By a water that silently wander'd by Thro' an old dim-lighted town, II Till I came to a palace fair to see. Wide open the windows were. My love at a window sat; and she Beckon'd me up the stair. III I roam'd thro' many a corridor, And many a chamber of state: Dim and silent was every floor And the day was growing late. IV When I came to the little rose-colour'd room From the curtains outflew a bat. The window was open: and in the gloom My love at the window sat. V She sat with her guitar on her knee, But she was not singing a note, For some one had drawn (ah, who could it be?) A knife across her throat. TWO OUT OF THE CROWD. I One circle of all its golden hours The flitting hand of the time-piece there, In its close white bower of china flowers, Hath rounded unaware: II While the firelight, flung from the flickering wall On the large and limpid mirror behind, Hath redden'd and darken'd down o'er all, As the fire itself declined. III Something of pleasure, and something of pain There lived in that sinking light. What is it? Faces I never shall look at again, In places you never will visit, IV Reveal'd themselves from each faltering ember, While, under a palely-wavering flame, Half of the years life aches to remember Reappear'd, and died as they came. V To its dark Forever an hour hath gone Since either you or I have spoken: Each of us might have been sitting alone In a silence so unbroken. VI I never shall know what made me look up (In this cushion'd chair so soft and deep, By the table where, over the empty cup, I was leaning, half asleep) VII To catch a gleam on the picture up there Of the saint in the wilderness under the oak; And a light on the brow of the bronze Voltaire, Like the ghost of a cynical joke; VIII To mark, in each violet, velvet fold Of the curtains that fall twixt room and room, The drowsy flush of the red light roll'd Thro' their drapery's glowing gloom. IX O'er the Rembrandt there—the Caracci here— Flutter warmly the ruddy and wavering hues; And St. Anthony over his book has a leer At the little French beauty by Greuze. X There—the Leda, weigh'd over her white swan's back, By the weight of her passionate kiss, ere it falls; On the ebony cabinet, glittering black Thro' its ivory cups and balls: XI Your scissors and thimble, and work laid away, With its silks, in the scented rose-wood box; The journals, that tell truth every day, And that novel of Paul de Kock's: XII The flowers in the vase, with their bells shut close In a dream of the far green fields where they grew; The cards of the visiting people and shows In that bowl with the sea-green hue. XIII Your shawl, with a queenly droop of its own, Hanging over the arm of the crimson chair: And, last—yourself, as silent as stone, In a glow of the firelight there! XIV I thought you were reading all this time. And was it some wonderful page of your book Telling of love, with its glory and crime, That has left you that sorrowful look? XV For a tear from those dark, deep, humid orbs, 'Neath their lashes, so long, and soft, and sleek, All the light in your lustrous eyes absorbs, As it trembles over your cheek. XVI Were you thinking how we, sitting side by side, Might be dreaming miles and miles apart? Or if lips could meet over a gulf so wide As separates heart from heart? XVII Ah, well! when time is flown, how it fled It is better neither to ask nor tell. Leave the dead moments to bury their dead. Let us kiss and break the spell! XVIII Come, arm in arm, to the window here; Draw by the thick curtain, and see how, to night, In the clear and frosty atmosphere, The lamps are burning bright. XIX All night, and for ever, in yon great town, The heaving Boulevart flares and roars; And the streaming Life, flows up and down From its hundred open doors. XX It is scarcely so cold, but I and you, With never a friend to find us out, May stare at the shops for a moment or two, And wander a while about. XXI For when in the crowd we have taken our place, (—Just two more lives to the mighty street there!) Knowing no single form or face Of the men and women we meet there,— XXII Knowing, and known of, none in the whole Of that crowd all round, but our two selves only, We shall grow nearer, soul to soul, Until we feel less lonely. XXIII Here are your bonnet and gloves, dear. There— How stately you look in that long rich shawl! Put back your beautiful golden hair, That never a curl may fall. XXIV Stand in the firelight . . . so, . . . as you were— Oh my heart, how fearfully like her she seem'd! Hide me up from my own despair, And the ghost of a dream I dream'd! BLUEBEARD. I Fair in the love of Fatima (A maiden like an evening star) Lay hid this stain'd and crookèd life, As in its sheath my scimitar: II For fair with flowrets damascene The sheath is traced and twined about, But on the blade are blood-spots black That time and rust will not wear out. III Beneath the hot pomegranate boughs At sunset here alone we sat. To call back something from that hour, I'd give away my Caliphat. IV “—Am I not fair?” “As evening air,” I answer'd. “Fresh?” “As April's sky.” “Whate'er I be,” she whisper'd me, “I love thee, and all thine am I. V “Be satisfied.” “Alas!” I sigh'd. And “wherefore do'st thou sigh?” she said. “Because I trace in thy fair face “The likeness of a face that's dead.” VI Rash question, rash reply! The rest Is writ in tears where all who read Revile my name. Ah Fatima, Why did'st thou seek to know my dead? VII Large realms were thine, with one reserve: Full many a chamber, many a hall, Thy wandering thought was free to rove: I gave thee up the keys of all. VIII One only key I warn'd thee, spare To use; because it opes a door That's shut for thy sake and for mine, But, open'd once, will shut no more: IX And thou that door hast oped, and thou Hast gazed upon the dead, and I That most thy fault, rash child, deplore, Must needs inflict its penalty! FATIMA. I A year ago, thy cheek was bright As oleander buds that break The dark of yonder dells by night Above the lamplit lake. II Pale as a snow drop in Cashmere Thy face to night, fair infant, seems. Ah, wretched child! what do'st thou hear When I talk in my dreams?— RESURRECTION. I At Paris it was, at the Opera there;— And she look'd like a Queen of old time that night, With the wreathèd pearls in her raven hair, And her breast with the diamond bright. II Side by side in our box we sat, Together, my bride-betroth'd and I: My gaze was fix'd on my opera-hat, And hers on the stage hard by: III And both were silent, and both were sad. Queenly she lean'd on her full white arm, With that regal, indolent air she had; So confident of her charm! IV I have not a doubt she was thinking then Of her former lord, good soul that he was! Who died the richest, and roundest of men, The Marquis of Carabas. V That narrow gate to the kingdom of heaven, He was not too portly, I trust, to pass. I wish him well, for the jointure given To my lady of Carabas. VI Meanwhile, I was thinking of my first love, As I had not been thinking of aught for years, Till over mine eyes there began to move Something that felt like tears. VII I thought of the dress that she wore last time, When we stood, 'neath the cypress trees, together, In that lost land, in her own soft clime, In the crimson evening weather, VIII By the broken wall, on the brown grass plot; And her warm white neck in its golden chain: And her full, soft hair, wound into a knot, And falling loose again: IX And the jasmin-flower in her fair young breast, (O the faint sweet smell of that jasmin-flower!) And the last bird singing alone to his nest, And the first star over the tower. X I thought of our little quarrels and strife, And the letter that brought me back my ring. And it all seem'd then—in the waste of life— Such a very little thing! XI For I thought of her grave below the hill, Which the sentinel cypress tree stands over. And I thought . . . ‘were she only living still, How I could forgive her, and love her!’ XII And I swear, as I thought of her thus, in that hour, And of how, after all, old things were best, That I smelt the smell of that jasmin-flower, Which she used to wear in her breast. XIII It smelt so faint, and it smelt so sweet, It made me creep, and it made me cold! Like the scent that steals from the crumbling sheet Where a mummy is half unroll'd. XIV And I turn'd and look'd. She was sitting there In a dim box over the stage; and drest In the dress that I knew,—with that full soft hair, And that jasmin in her breast. XV She was there, and I was here: And the glittering horseshoe curved between: And from here to there, and from tier to tier, —From my bride that was to have been, XVI To my early love, with her eyes down-cast, And over her blush-rose face the shade, (In short, from the Future back to the Past) There was but a step to be made. XVII To my early love from my future bride One moment I look'd. Then I stole to the door, And traversed the passage, and down at her side I was sitting, a moment more. XVIII My thinking of her, or the music's strain, Or something that never will be exprest. Had brought her back from the grave again And brought her back to my breast. XIX She is not dead, and she is not wed! But she loves me now, and she loved me then! And the very first word that her sweet lips said, My heart grew youthful again. XX The Marchioness there, of Carabas, She is wealthy, and young, and handsome still, And but for her . . . well, we'll let that pass, She may marry whomever she will. XXI But I will marry my own first love, With her blush-rose face: for old things are best; And the flower in her bosom, I prize it above The brooch in my lady's breast. XXII The world is fill'd with folly and sin, And love must cling where it can, I say: For Beauty is easy enough to win; But one isn't loved every day. XXIII And I think, in the lives of most women and men, There's a moment when all would go smooth and even, If only the dead could find out when To come back, and be forgiven. THE CHESS-BOARD. Irene, do you yet remember, Ere we were grown so sadly wise, Those evenings in the bleak December, Curtain'd warm from the snowy weather, When you and I play'd chess together, Checkmated by each other's eyes? Ah, still I see your soft white hand Hovering warm o'er Queen and Knight. Brave Pawns in valiant battle stand: The double Castles guard the wings: The Bishop, bent on distant things, Moves, sidling, through the fight. Our fingers touch: our glances meet, And falter; falls your golden hair Against my cheek; your bosom sweet Is heaving. Down the field, your Queen Rides slow her soldiery all between, And checks me unaware. Ah me! the little battle's done, Disperst is all its chivalry; Full many a move, since then, have we 'Mid Life's perplexing chequers made, And many a game with Fortune play'd,— What is it we have won? This, this at least—if this alone;— That never, never, never more, As in those old still nights of yore, (Ere we were grown so sadly wise) Can you and I shut out the skies, Shut out the world, and wintry weather, And, eyes exchanging warmth with eyes, Play chess, as then we play'd, together! HOME-SICKNESS. I, often lying lonely, over seas, At ope of day, soft-couch'd in foreign land, Dream a green dream of England; when young trees Make murmur, and the amber-stripèd bees To search the woodbine through, a busy band, Come floating at the casement, while new-tann'd And tedded hay sends fresh on morning breeze Incense of sunny fields, through curtains fann'd With invitations faint to Far-away. So dreaming, half-awake, at ope of day, Dream I of daisy greens, and village pales, And the white winking of the warmèd may In blossomy hedge, and brown oak-leavèd dales, And little children dear, at dewy play, Till all my heart grows young and glad as they; And sweet thoughts come and go, like scented gales, Through an open window when the month is gay. But often, wandering lonely, over seas, At shut of day, in unfamiliar land, What time the serious light is on the leas, To me there comes a sighing after ease Much wanted, and an aching wish to stand Knee-deep in English grass, and have at hand A little churchyard cool, with native trees, And grassy mounds thick-laced with ozier band, Wherein to rest at last, nor further stray. So, sad of heart, muse I, at shut of day, On safe and quiet England; till thought ails With inward groanings deep, for meadows gray, Gray copses cool with twilight, shady dales, Home-gardens, full of rest, where never may Come loud intrusion; and, what chiefly fails My sick desire, old friendships fled away. I am much vext with loss. Kind Memory, lay My head upon thy lap, and tell me tales Of the good old time, when all was pure and gay! FATA MORGANA. I When the latest strife is lost, and all is done with, Ere we slumber in the spirit and the brain, We drowse back, in dreams, to days that life begun with, And their tender light returns to us again. II I have cast away the tangle and the torment Of the cords that bound my life up in a mesh: And the pulse begins to throb that long lay dormant 'Neath their pressure; and the old wounds bleed afresh. III I am touch'd again with shades of early sadness, Like the summer-cloud's light shadow in my hair: I am thrill'd again with breaths of boyish gladness, Like the scent of some last primrose on the air. IV And again she comes, with all her silent graces, The lost woman of my youth, yet unpossest: And her cold face so unlike the other faces Of the women whose dead lips I since have prest. V The motion and the fragrance of her garments Seem about me, all the day long, in the room: And her face, with its bewildering old endearments, Comes at night, between the curtains, in the gloom. VI When vain dreams are stirr'd with sighing, near the morning, To my own her phantom lips I feel approach: And her smile, at eve, breaks o'er me without warning From its speechless, pale, perpetual reproach. VII When Life's dawning glimmer yet had all the tint there Of the orient, in the freshness of the grass, (Ah what feet since then have trodden out the print there!) Did her soft, her silent footsteps fall, and pass. VIII They fell lightly, as the dew falls, 'mid ungather'd Meadow-flowers; and lightly linger'd with the dew. But the dew is gone, the grass is dried and wither'd, And the traces of those steps have faded too. IX Other footsteps fall about me—faint, uncertain, In the shadow of the world, as it recedes: Other forms peer thro' the half-uplifted curtain Of that mystery which hangs behind the creeds. X What is gone is gone for ever. And new fashions May replace old forms which nothing can restore: But I turn from sighing back departed passions With that pining at the bosom as of yore. XI I remember to have murmur'd, morn and even, “Though the Earth dispart these Earthlies, face from face, Yet the Heavenlies shall surely join in Heaven, For the spirit hath no bonds in time or space: XII “Where it listeth, there it bloweth; all existence Is its region; and it houseth, where it will. I shall feel her through immeasurable distance, And grow nearer, and be gather'd to her, still. XIII “If I fail to find her out by her gold tresses, Brows, and breast, and lips, and language of sweet strains, I shall know her by the traces of dead kisses, And that portion of myself which she retains.” XIV But my being is confused with new experience, And changed to something other than it was; And the Future with the Past is set at variance; And Life falters 'neath the burthens which it has. XV Famisht hopes press fast behind me, weakly wailing: Faint before me fleets the good I have not done: And my search for her may still be unavailing 'Mid the spirits that are pass'd beyond the sun. CONSOLATION. When I perceive how slight and poor appears (Though with sad care and strong compulsion brought Down rangèd rhymes with strenuous search of thought) The express'd result of my most passionate years; Remembering, too, from what divinest spheres Stoop'd many a starry visitant, and taught My spirit at her toils,—how round her wrought Strong Raptures, Sorrows, Splendours rich in tears, My whole heart fails me. Then an inward voice Replies, ‘Possess thyself, and be content. Life's best is bound not by the utterance Of any word, nor may in sound be spent, To win back echoes out of hollow chance. What thou hast felt is thine. If much, rejoice.’ A CONFESSION AND APOLOGY. 'Tis time that I should loose from life at last This heart's unworthy longing for the past, Ere life be turn'd to loathing. For love,—at least, this love, of one for one,— Is, at the best, not all beneath the sun, And, at the worst, 'tis nothing. Not that, of all the past, I would forget One pleasure, or one pain. I cherish yet, And would dishonour never, All I have felt. But, cherisht tho' it be, 'Tis time my past should set my future free For life's renew'd endeavour. Not much I reverence that remorse which flies To desert caves, and bids its dupes despise Themselves, on whom it preys; Wasting the worth of life on worthless pain, To make the future, as the past was, vain, By endless self-dispraise: As tho', forsooth, because a man is not His self-made god, he needs must curse his lot With self-contempt! as tho' Some squalid maniac, that with lifelong moan Insults man's flesh and blood, with these hath done The best that man can do! Nor am I keen to urge that common claim On this world, or another,—here, for fame, Which only grows on graves,— Or, there, for so much, purchasable here By earth's joy stinted, of celestial cheer; The stimulant of slaves! Not for reward,—not for release from pain,— But with a man's imperative disdain Of all that wastes man's nature, Rise, O my soul, and reach to loftier things, Untrammell'd by this florid weed that clings, Stunting a spirit's stature! I was not born to sit, with shrowded head, Piping shrill ditties to the unburied dead, While life's arm'd host sweeps by. I hear the clarion call, the warsteed neigh, The banner fluttering in the wind's free play, The brave man's battle-cry: And I am conscious that where all things strive 'Tis shameful to sit still. I would not live Content with a life lost In chasing mine own fancies thro' void air, Or decking forth in forms and phrases fair The miserable ghost Of personal joy or pain. The ages roll Forward; and, forward with them, draw my soul Into time's infinite sea. And to be glad, or sad, I care no more: But to have done, and to have been, before I cease to do and be. From the minutest struggle to excell Of things whose momentary myriads dwell In drops of dew confined, To spirits standing on life's upmost stair, Whose utterances alter worlds, and are The makers of mankind, All things cry shame on lips that squander speech In words which,—if not deeds,—are worthless each. Not here are such words wanted, Where all bestirs itself,—where dumb things do By nobly silent action speak, and go Forth to their fates undaunted. Shame on the wretch who, born a man, foregoes Man's troublous birthright for a brute's repose! Shame on the eyes that see This mighty universe, yet see not there Something of difficult worth a man may dare Boldly to do and be! Yet is there nought for shame in any thing Once dear and beautiful. The shrivell'd wing, Scathed by what seem'd a star And proved, alas, no star, but withering fire, Is worthier than the wingless worm's desire For nothing fair or far. Rather the ground that's deep enough for graves, Rather the stream that's strong enough for waves, Than the loose sandy drift Whose shifting surface cherishes no seed Either of any flower or any weed, Which ever way it shift, Or stagnant shallow which the storms despise Nought finding there to prey upon, I prize. Why should man's spirit shrink From feeling to the utmost,—be it pain Or pleasure,—all 'twas form'd, nor form'd in vain, To feel with force? I think That never to have aim'd and miss'd, is not To have achieved. I hold the loftier lot To ennoble, not escape, Life's sorrows and love's pangs. I count a man, Tho' sick to death, for something nobler than A healthy dog or ape. I deem that nothing suffer'd or enjoy'd By a man's soul deserves to be destroy'd, But rather to be made Means of a soul's encreased capacity Either to suffer,—and to gain thereby A more exalted grade Among the spirits purified by pain, Or to enjoy,—and thereby to attain That lovelier influence Reserved for spirits that, 'mid the general moan Of human griefs, praise God with clearest tone Of joyous trust intense. And, for this reason, I would yet keep fair And fresh the memory of all things that were Sweet in their place and season. And I forgive my life its failures too, Since failures old, to guide endeavours new, Are good for the same reason. REQUIESCAT. I sought to build a deathless monument To my dead love. Therein I meant to place All precious things, and rare: as Nature blent All single sweetnesses in one sweet face. I could not build it worthy her mute merit, Nor worthy her white brows and holy eyes, Nor worthy of her perfect and pure spirit, Nor of my own immortal memories. But, as some rapt artificer of old, To enshrine the ashes of a virgin saint, Might scheme to work with ivory, and fine gold, And carven gems, and legended and quaint Seraphic heraldries; searching far lands, Orient and occident, for all things rare, To consecrate the toil of reverent hands, And make his labour, like her virtue, fair; Knowing no beauty beautiful as she, And all his labour void, but to beguile A sacred sorrow; so I work'd. Ah, see Here are the fragments of my shatter'd pile! I keep them, and the flowers that sprang between Their broken workmanship—the flowers and weeds! Sleep soft among the violets, O my Queen— Lie calm among my ruin'd thoughts and deeds. END OF WANDERER. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. ODE TO A STARLING. Spring's pilot, and her nimblest-wingèd darling, Despite the arrowy-flighted Swallow That in thy wake doth follow, To rob thee of renown, intrepid Starling! Full weary of old Winter, sick of sorrow, As I lay a-drowsing in the dark at dawn of day, Seeking to shut from sight a sunless morrow, And sueing to assist me flitting Sleep, that would not stay, Out of dim lands remote Came a hoarse but happy note; And then a scatter'd rustling loud beyond the lattice eaves Of jostled wings, a-riot in the rare and rainy leaves. Surely, surely, saucy angel Of the virgin Spring's evangel, 'Twas the sound of thee and thine, Singing songs yet somewhat hoarser For the sea-wind and the brine Breath'd and braved by each precursor Of May's azure and sunshine; Songs of triumph ne'ertheless, And tumultuous mirthfulness, Proclaiming prophets come Here, where cold April grieves Among her few wet leaves, To build in low-bent apple boughs their little breezy home. Yet can I not divine By any outward sign, Blithe bird whose brimful song the unsteady wind spills o'er the lea, For what reason thou hast sought A land so void of aught Which me, had I thy wings, could 'lure its visitor to be. Is it because thou hast Such a kindness for the past That in all remember'd places there is pleasantness for thee? Or rather, as I deem, Prophet of bud and beam, That thou such insight keen Hast into things unseen That beauty yet unveil'd thou do'st in vernal visions see? I, at least, thy voice believing, And, in responsive mood, Religiously receiving Its prophecies of good, All the morn long have been roaming The wet field and wintry wood, The burthen of an old song humming:— ‘The starlings are come! and merry May, And June, and the white thorn, and the hay, And the violet, and then the rose, and all sweet things are coming!’ But O ill-welcom'd bird! Thy most impassion'd lays By heedless ears are heard. Thou comest before thy time, and unattended. The sluggard Spring delays To justify thy word; And rancorous Winter stays To wreak on thee the wrath of frosts and rains offended; Whilst thou of sunny days Still singest, undeterr'd By scorn, or stinted praise, Befriending thus a land that leaves thee unbefriended. Wherefore to me thou art Dearer a thousand times Than other singers are. For 'tis not careful art, Nor yet melodious rhymes, 'Tis courage that is rare. Courage, before Today, Upon his tyrant throne, To make, without dismay, Tomorrow's mission known; To preach the unpraised good By time not yet asserted, And, tho' misunderstood, Remain undisconcerted. And I, O lyrist lone, Because I am not one Of those who share, or swell, the praise Bestow'd on songs of softer tone But meaner purpose, needs must raise One note, tho' rude as is thine own, And heard by few, and hail'd by none, To welcome thy courageous lays, Whose mirth, on rainy breezes blown, The meed of May's Blithe homage pays To April's churlish sun. Envy not thou Cëyx, or Halcyon, Their sultry seas, fair-meadow'd lands of fable, And foamless isles, the tempest strikes not on, That sleep in harbours green and hospitable; For thou, within thyself, despite foul weather, Hast golden calms and glories Like windless lights where wizards meet together On stormy promontories. O leave to the luxurious Nightingale Her amorous revels and imbower'd delights Where, over lush rose leaves the balmy gale Is breathing low thro' blue midsummer nights. Thine is the bardic chant, the battle strain, The strenuous impulse thine, Antagonizing wind and sleety rain In the tough-headed pine. Leave to the Lark his lucid chariotings And mirth Memnonian, when auroral skies With rorid azure bathe his rapturous wings. Thy realm beyond tomorrow's orient lies, Safe from the reach of this anarchic time, Where unreveal'd primroses, And many a lurking love, and budding rhyme Each note of thine discloses. And for that reason thou Hast little heed, I trow, Of old spleenful Winter scattering His spent snows against thy wing. Thee the sharp and churlish chattering Of a half-discrownèd king Cannot vex or chafe: Nor the light and timid swallow, Proffering his friendship shallow When his friend is safe. A cautious after-comer, He comes of common kind, Secure of sun and summer, And very sure to find, What thou hast never known, The fame that lags behind The first who flies alone. Thy friends are yet unborn; The earliest violet, The first bud on the thorn, The first wan cowslip, wet With tears of the first morn That doth such joys beget. Thy foes are yet a-dying; Ragged-skirted rains, Winds at random flying Fast with cloudy manes, And the last snows, lying Lost on chilly plains. Grief and Joy together Colloquize with thee: Sad and sunny weather Shift around the tree Where, not heeding either, Thou do'st carol free Such brave song as neither (Harshest tho' it be) Critics' scorn can wither Not their praises fee. A music over-winging On laughter-lifted pinions Earth's bleakness and despair, Like old Amphion's singing, To raise serene dominions And fashion from void air, Stirr'd by the nimbly-sounding minions Of its mysterious mandate, everywhere Those blossomy battlements, And florid tents, Where, in due time, shall dwell All the delicious sights, and sounds, and scents Of Spring's green citadel. THE LAY OF THE COCK. I. Who will awaken the Lay of the Cock? Who will praise his prowess and power? Who will sing of his virtues seven? II. If there be any of mortal stock Worthy to say ‘I will waken that lay,’ Uplifted high on a lofty tower Where the light is holy and fresh from heaven, In a white robe stoled, with a harp of gold, He, in the hearing of gods and men, Should smite his harp; and the matin hour Should make his lips as were Memnon's, when That strong marmorean mouth of his From the rapturous east a reorient ray Of his mother's fairest effulgences Did, with a mystical fiery touch, To a sudden etherial melody wake. Alas, that in me is no music such As would then be heard for my hero's sake! Yet, because for the lack of a bard to make The world aware of how great they were, Heroes, 'tis said, there have been upon earth Whose worth, tho' beyond Agamemnon's worth, Hath miss'd due honour, heroical bird, Since worthier singers are silent still, Needs must thou suffer that, undeterr'd By mine own unworth, and my want of skill, I make essay, at the dawn of day, In honour of thine to awaken the lay, And, as tho' I stood on a lofty tower Where the light is holy and fresh from heaven, In a white robe stoled, with a harp of gold, To hymn high praise of thy prowess and power, And do homage in song to thy virtues seven. III. Handmaid of heroes, Martial Muse! Bring to me, prithee, a burnisht shield, Broad argent, pure, without blemish or bruise; Such as, of old, upon roaring field, The magnanimous monarch Idomeneus A cock was painted on the shield of Idomeneus. Was wont in the burly of battle to wield Mid immortals and mortals of marvellous thews. By the mighty spirits of warriors old Let the orb of that mighty shield be borne: And roll me hither, thro' heavens that hold High pageant to welcome the triumphing Morn, Aurora's chariots, whose chargers bold The youngest-born of the Hours adorn With housing of glory and harness of gold, Fann'd by the purple of fiery plumes, And vermeil inviolate, laughing to scorn The vividest twine of all Tyrian looms, Then, ere one of its fleeting ardours faint, Or ever a gorgeous cloud grow wan, Dip me the pencil in each bright dye Of that aëry pageant, that I may paint Whom but the hero that marcheth by In robes of honour regalian, Mail'd and mantled, with crest on high, The valorous marshal of Day's blithe van. IV. And all the while, by down and dale Where dews are fresh and light is clear, From far away i' the buxom gale Let brave-mouth'd bronzen music come Of chiding trump and thunderous drum, Thrilling the heart of the man who may hear, Like the moving on of some marvellous tale Of chivalry joust and knightly cheer. V. With royal train,—rich-spouted rain, From feathery fount, of plumage roll'd In rearward pomp,—whose sheeny stain Is sable shot with emerolde; Breastplate broad of brightest gold; Scarlet crest, thick turreted As Cybele's, on stately head; Beard of ruddier tinct than is (If old legends lie not) his Who, full-arm'd, is slumbering still Hid in the heart of Salzburg hill; Shining cuishes, greaves of steel; Spleenful spur on knightly heel; Who is he doth lightly leap, Flashing forth o' the night's dim tent When the dew is deep, and the lark asleep, Orient arms in the Orient? VI. It is the guardian, gallant and gay, Of the great world's drowsy conscience. Day By day he doth in the twilight wan Rise up, and, with resonant roundelay, From the cloven caverns of dream unlock Sleep's bondsmen, speeding upon their way The wills and wishes of waken'd man. How shall we hail him? what is his name? His names are many, for wide his fame; Blue-helm'd Bellona's champion, The Bird of Mars, Alectryon, The Bird of Fire, the Bird of Lok; Sacred sire of a sacred clan; Faithfullest chief of the feathery flock Since temples arose in Asia, Or priests and augurs their rites began, Roman, Grecian, Arabian, And Runic,—they whose spells could sway Sea-hurricanes Scandinavian. VII. Wise and wary as one should be That is vigilant lord of the virtues seven, First of all upon earth is he To watch, and be ware of, change in heaven. For in heaven a bride he hath; and she Is starry, tender, and fair to see; Whose mystical name is Alcyon. The constellation of the Pleiades was called by the Arabian Astronomers “The Hen and chickens.”— To her he merrily three times three Soundeth his strepitant clarion. Since nothing hath he to hide; but, free And open, he beareth wherever he wend A fearless front and a spirit bold In all his wooings and all his wars. Which well they knew, those Flamens old Who in honour did hold for his corselet of gold, His stately stride, and his crest on end, The armèd comrade of mighty Mars, And fair Minerva's familiar friend. VIII. When he walketh under the vaulted arch Wherethro' a mounted knight might march At easy speed his pacing steed Nor bruise one plume of his helmet crest, This bird, whose magnanimous graciousness The least of his kingly gestes express, Hath so lofty a heart in so lordly a breast That, with condescensive and sidelong tread, Lightly he boweth his stately head, For courtesy's sake, as becometh a king With his vassals around him progressing. IX. Then up on a great sunbeam he springeth, His clashing vans doth thrice unlock With a shudder of joy, and make sweet shock Of all his silken sheeny feathers And wingeth, but not far he wingeth, His weighty flight, erect and tall Descending on the breezy wall, Where he with voice sonorous singeth, After the fashion of his forefathers To rally his clan from far away, His ancient famous roundelay. But first, as when in martial Rome, Before the Conscript Fathers all, Uprising with importance, some Great orator sedate and tall Assumed imposing attitude, With gather'd robe and right arm bare, So he, in oratoric mood, With finger'd foot upcurl'd in air, Fit posture doth select; then high And shrill is heard the rallying cry Whereto, his kinsmen, answering him From distant regions, make reply; While he, with inward ecstacy, Doth either dim blue eyelid film Let fall o'er each delighted eye. X. Anon, the noon is high up-wheel'd And reapers droop in oaten field. But he for whom my harp I string (So might I half his glory share!) In easy state, an orient king Gracious, grave, and debonair, Thro' his throng'd seraglio moveth 'Mid his strutting queens; and, stately, One he seeketh, one reproveth, Ruling all sedately. Well-skill'd in government is he, High-couraged, honourable, And gentle-manner'd, as should be Good kings whose thrones are stable: Wise, loving, watchful as a star, By lofty thoughts uplifted; And, birds or men, full few there are So affluently gifted. XI. Chanted and told to a harp of gold, Upon seven strings, should his virtues be; That be sevenfold as, in time of old, Were the Seven Spirits of Chivalrie: Noble Valour, that feareth none: Prudence, that keepeth what Valour hath won: Vigilance, arm'd on his watch-tower tall: Justice, the joyous controller of all: Temperance, who to the Virtues, her brothers And sisters, is handmaiden, helping those others: Courtesy, skill'd without falsehood to please: And Love, the lifegiver, that leadeth all these. Chanted and told to a harp of pure gold, Upon strings that are seven, with song sevenfold, Worthy to be are his virtues. And we, If we were as bold, as loving, as free, High-hearted, strong-soul'd, and wise, as he, As sober, vigorous, vigilant, just, And joyous, and scornful of mean mistrust, Then the world would be what the world to me Doth seem when I hear, in the sunshine clear, This minstrel making magnanimous cheer, And hailing the light with a heart of glee. For his brave song teacheth timely content: And, far as it reacheth, my soul is sent, Honouring God's good government, And greeting the general joy of the world: While music without, and mirth within, Mingle my heart with the merry din Of a loud and high defiance hurl'd At darkness, and sorrow, and sin. LITTLE ELLA. I I know now, little Ella, what the flowers Said to you then, to make your cheek so pale; And why the blackbird in our laurel bowers Spake to you only, and the timorous snail Fear'd less your steps than those of the May shower. It is not strange these creatures loved you so, And told you all. 'Twas not so long ago You were yourself a bird, or else a flower. II And, little Ella, you were pale because So soon you were to die. I know that now. And why there ever seem'd a sort of gauze Over your deep blue eyes, and sad young brow. You were too good to grow up, Ella, you, And be a woman, such as I have known! And so upon your heart they put a stone, And left you, child, among the flowers and dew. III O thou, the morning star of my sad soul! My little elfin friend from Faëry Land! Whose memory is yet innocent of the whole Of that which makes me doubly need thy hand, Thy guiding hand from mine so soon withdrawn! Here, where I find so little like to thee, For thou wert as the breath of dawn to me, Starry, and pure, and brief, as is the dawn. IV Thy knight was I, and thou my Faëry Queen. ('Twas in the days of love and chivalry!) And thou did'st hide thee in a bower of green. But then so well hast hidden thee, that I Have never found thee since. And thou did'st set Many a task, and quest, and high emprize, Ere I should win from thine approving eyes My guerdon,—ah! so many, that not yet V My tasks are ended, nor my wanderings o'er. But some day there will come across the main A magic barque, and I shall quit this shore Of care, and find thee, in thy bower, again; And thou wilt say, “My brother, hast thou found Our home at last?” . . . Whilst I, in answer, sweet, Shall heap my life's last booty at thy feet, And bare my breast with many a bleeding wound. VI The spoils of time! the trophies of a world! The keys of conquer'd towns, and captived kings, And many a broken sword, and banner furl'd, The heads of giants, and swart soldan's rings, And many a maiden's scarf, and many a wand Of baffled wizard, many an amulet, And many a shield with mine own heart's blood wet, And jewels rare from many a distant land! VII How sweet with thee, my sister to renew, The happy search for those ethereal birds Which back to their own climes thou did'st pursue,— Ah, heedless! thou, in all whose deeds and words Unkindness never was till then, nor lack Of care for others' pain! Could'st thou but see How woeful weary is my want of thee, Methinks that even now thou would'st come back; VIII Leaving thy heavenly playmates, for my sake, To let me lean my head upon thy breast, And weep away those worst of griefs that ache And scorch, but cannot turn to tears. Or, best, The way that leads where thou art gone, contrive O child, to whisper to me! Ope the gate, And help me thro'. Else, I shall die too late Even for thy consoling to revive. IX She pass'd out of my youth at the still time O' the early light, when all was green and husht. She pass'd, and pass'd away. Like broken rhyme Her sweet short life's few relics are. This crusht And scatter'd rose, she dropp'd: that page, she turn'd, And finish'd not: this curl, her gift: this knot That flutter'd from her . . . Hard world, harm them not! My right to keep them hath been sorely earn'd. FORM. I A man walks through a wood, Admiring what he sees there: How blessèd if he could Admire, and be at ease there! But ah! his admiration he must utilize, or doubt of it. So he lops off a branch, resolved to fashion something out of it. II As though the thing were not, Already ere he take it, A something more than what His utmost means can make it! He knows not what he wants to make: this only who shall gainsay? Something he must make out of it, since man's a maker, men say. III He chisels, chips, and chops, And carves, as he is able: Now plans a chair, now stops And meditates a table. At length, grown somewhat weary, in the midst of all his toils, it Strikes him that, the more he chips and chops, the more he spoils it. IV He pauses; wipes the sweat, Discouraged, from his forehead; Casts down his eyes; and yet The failure seems more horrid. But lo you! in his workshop, having sidled through the door there, A little child is playing with the shavings on the floor there. V And, as they fall self-roll'd, Each wooden ringlet nearing, The child hath made, behold! Out of each a pretty earring. Friend, that child, to finest uses fitting chances, must appal you, Turning accident to ornament,—your rubbish to his value. VI So we mend God's making, And so mar it for the most part: So chance-comers, taking From the dust what seem'd the lost part Of our labour, suffer Fancy to sport with it: and the Muses, That neglected our endeavour, turn its failure to her uses. DROPPINGS. I The leaves that fall on the grassy wall, And the rain dropping out of the apple tree! And is it only a passing dream? For I know not why, but these things seem Just now worth more than the world to me. II Fast the leaves fall on the grassy wall; Fast drops the rain from the apple tree; And if I could feel what I feel now But a moment longer, I think I should know More than ever was known, or known will be. III Wherefore? Leaves fall all day on the wall, All day drops rain from the apple tree. But never before did the leaves and the rain, And they doubtless will never, never again, Seem about to impart such a secret to me. IV Mere leaves that fall on yonder wall! Mere rain dropping down out of yonder tree! What matter? If Nature has something to say, Let her take her own time, let her choose her own way, So long as at last she will say it to me. V Ah! but leaves will fall, as now, on the wall, And rain, as now, drop from out of the tree, Many, many a day, while the chance, I know, Is lost! I have miss'd what, a moment ago, The leaves and the rain had confided to me. ????? ???????. Well and good is this doctrine of “Know thyself,” And let him obey it, that can, to the letter; Self-ignorance being the veriest fetter That ever kept fools in the stocks, no doubt. But, while the Greek sages lie there on my shelf, Why should I scruple to speak my mind out, And assert that ‘Forget thyself’ is a better? Self-unconsciousness being, perchance, The one thing free from self-ignorance. Not by looking within, but by living without, This centre of self, shall a man grow wise. Let us, leaving ourselves, then, go boldly about, And take part in the business of earth and skies: For only by knowledge of that which is not Thyself, shall thyself be learn'd, I wot. Woe to the nation, and woe to the age, and woe, woe to the man That live not outside of themselves! To them dissolution is near. Healthful and happy are they that, promoting the infinite plan, Are moved with the movement of things, and have joy in the general cheer. KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM. Measure thy knowledge by the weight of it, Which is a kind of sorrowfulness. Men Dig deep, get gold, and judge its value then, According as the heaviness be great of it. But love thy wisdom for the lightness of it. Glad wisdom is not gotten, but is given: Not dug out of the earth, but dropp'd from Heaven: Heavenly, not earthly, is the brightness of it. WALKING TO THE TOWN. I As I walk to the Town, Now the hedges are blown, And the white-thorn is thick on the air, And young butterflies hoist Milk-white sails from the moist Open-mouth'd buttercups here and there, II While the high-shoulder'd grig, Whose great heart is too big For his body this blue May morn, Screams out of the spikes Of the grass, as he strikes At the stalks of the emerald corn,— III I say, as I walk To the Town, and talk To myself, with, now and then, A good word as I go To the flowers that I know, And now to the women and men, IV (For the waggoner plods By his team, and nods, And the girl tripping over the stile, Laughing shy, turning back On the lone meadow track, Leaves the sweet air more sweet for her smile,) V How little I care, While the weather holds fair, What Europe may do with To-day! If 'tis war be the chance, Or the sphynx that's in France, For once let the chance slip away. VI Let the merchants be stirr'd By the ghost of a word Dropt in Paris, and caught up elsewhere, Or a manikin Duke Laugh to scorn the rebuke Of the Berlin grandees, . . . need I care? VII But how much shall I care If some cloud unaware (And the sky is not cloudless all) Should ruin and stain With one smear of blue rain Those meads basking under the wall! VIII How much if, alas! In the field yet to pass The wind should blow round to the south, And so blow away The tost balm of the hay From my forehead, and eyes, and mouth! END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. POEMS CLASSICAL, HISTORICAL, AND CHARACTERISTIC. “L' Histoire ne commence et ne finit nulle part.” Louis Blanc. THE IDEAL WORLD. AS INTERPRETED BY RABBI BEN ENOCH. (FROM THE SCROLL AND ITS INTERPRETERS.) (Ben Enoch Expounds.) . . . Mark, how of old Men held what I, alone of moderns, hold: (Ben Shishak's known philosophy in this I recognize, and take the gloss for his) —Namely, that this thrice complicated world, Whereof Man stands i' the centre, hath enfurl'd, And superposed as 'twere, three orbs distinct Of Life. Each diverse, tho' together linkt By Life's one law for whatsoever lives, Whereby of each Earth gains, to each Earth gives, What helps in turn, the End-all, and the Be-all: One Animal: one Human: one Ideal: Three circles of one sphere. Of these, the least And lowest, is the kingdom of the beast, Which man commands: who holds the middle place Between Earth's lowest, and her highest, race. But that which is the loftiest of the Three, Sole region of Ideas, I take to be: Which man, in truth, subserveth and obeyeth, As him the brute beneath him. Whoso sayeth A man's ideas to a man belong, Knoweth not what he saith, or argueth wrong. Far rather, I imagine, doth the Man Belong to the Idea. For neither can The Man command the Idea, nor deny Submission to its mandate. Can he fly From its pursuing? or its path dictate? Or summons, or dismiss, or bid it wait, Or hasten—here advance, and there stand still— Now active be, now passive—at his will? And, if it live not servile to his whim, Say, can he slay it? Doth it not slay him, Inexorably, with no mercy shown, As he would slay a beast that is his own, If his death, rather than his life, promote That end whereto the Idea doth devote The Man it uses? All as well my mule, Whose footsteps I by staff and bridle rule, Might think he rules me,—goeth by the road His choice, not mine, selects, nor own the goad, As that, for my part, I should boast to be The lord of that ideal lord of me Whose force I follow, and whose burthen bear, Not as I will, but as I must, where'er He goads me. And, if this brute mule of mine Should lord it o'er his fellow mules, opine Himself the sage whose way is Wisdom's track, Because he bears my wisdom on his back, Were not his folly all the worse? ‘What then,’ One asketh, ‘arguest thou, apart from men, Ideas can exist? doth not man's mind Create the Ideal?’ Nay, friend, for I find Ideas make men, not men ideas. They The dwellers of the ideal world, I say, Are independent of mankind so much As man is of the brutes. No more. For such As is mankind's requirement of a race Beneath it, born to serve it,—in like case Is man. . . . Oh not by any means the lord, But sturdy servitor, of that dim horde Of dwellers on his brain; which, truly, need And freely use,—to bear them, or to feed,— For pasture, or for burthen, as may be— Man, for their sakes created. Natheless he Doth commonly consider and declare That he is Something Great, because aware Of Something Great within him. In like way I dream'd the dial to the beam did say ‘Lo, I am Time!’ A little wind was waked, Across the sun a little cloudlet shaked, And the vain index of the heedless hour Relapsed to nothingness. In many a flower The moth and grub their dubious egglets hide. Can the flower choose, or doth the flower decide What to the summons of the sun shall rise From her chance treasures to amaze men's eyes? This launches, sapphrine-mantled, mail'd with gold, Some warlike wyvern beautiful and bold, Fit for the Persic say that rides to woo His shy queen, gaily, in her globe of dew: That sends forth, barely fit to browze on burrs, A monster hateful as the imp that spurs His sooty flank, and hums a hell-born hymn, Forth venturing darkly when the air is dim. I can but laugh, not seldom, in my sleeve, When I look round the world, and there perceive How men have builded monuments of brass To others on whose brains the whim it was Of some Idea, on its sightless way About the world, to settle, seize, and prey. Why should the beasts, man scorns, not also raise, After their fashion, some such baaing praise About the sure-foot horse man drives, the ox He ploughs with, or the fatlings of the flocks Man kills for his best banquet? Now, I deem That in the purpose of the One Supreme Man is not, as he holds himself to be, The highest necessity on Earth. But he, Born for the service of Ideas alone, Is for their sake, as they are for their own. Notice, which most concerns, most occupies, That Providence whereby man lives and dies: Men or Ideas? An Idea hath need Of growth,—full scope to satisfy its greed Of power, and multiply, and propagate. To meet which, man is there i' the mass. Now wait. What happens? mark the issue. Men must perish Wholesale, it may be, or piecemeal, to cherish, Enrich, and ratify, the otherwise Starved and pent life this one Idea tries To nourish at men's cost; itself or these Succumbing. Which doth the World's Ruler please To rescue or confirm? Why, horde on horde Nature, to serve her supernatural lord, Of her selectest human children gives. Little accounts she their mere deaths or lives! 'Tis but a race to ravage, but a realm To wash away in blood, expunge, o'erwhelm. Doth Nature shrink from,—Providence impeach,— The sacrifice required? Men's bodies bleach On bloody battle-fields uncounted. Men Born to be used thus: ended there and then, Their use being over. Dead and done with, they! Yet not in vain, do after-comers say, Lived they or died they, since their lives and deaths (Else vainly born and buried in vain breaths) Have served to manifest, make eminent, The Idea for which they lived and died, content. But to themselves, who doubts these men's lives seem'd Of all-surpassing value? Each was deem'd By the dead owner of it something worth The special cherishing of Mother Earth. And if to save and foster man's life were Earth's, or Earth's Arch Disposer's, chiefest care We must, for those men's sakes (whose life, pour'd forth Like water, seems mere waste of what was worth Such frustrate forethrift, care so baulk'd of gain, In the fine fashioning of nerve and brain) Attribute failure vast, or drear neglect, To Earth's great Justicer and Architect. But He,—that wrecks man's life i' the sharp ordeal Which rescues life's pure essence from the unreal, The false, the fleeting—heeds not how it fare With the mere Human, born for death: Whose care Is for the Ideal that doth never die. The human swarm swims, in its season, by: Races on races rise and roll away: The generations flourish and decay. What laughing Phantom leads, and mocks, the dance Of these blind mummers thro' the Masque of Chance? Lives on the life that from their lips it drains, More glorious waxes as their glory wanes, Brightens its deathless eyes in that fine air Whose ardent essence man's prolong'd despair Feeds with the fires that waste it, and doth dwell On dead men's graves, deathless, impalpable, Made of immortal element, the pure Result of man—man's life that doth endure Above the dust man drops in? What survives Save this, the ceaseless dying of men's lives? Egypt and all her castes—bold Babylon, Beautiful Hellas—Rome's Republic—gone! What rests, on earth, the lone result of these? The airy, but immutable, images Of their Ideals, in the life that lies, To light our own, above us. Starrier eyes Than ours are on us. Egypt's Thought, the Grace Of Hellas,—now no more to render place To Rome's strong Will,—the stout town-stealer. . . There Behold man's bright pall-bearers—they that bear On their calm brows, for costliest coronal, The symbols of the summ'd-up ages all! KING SOLOMON AND THE MOUSE. I King Solomon stood, in his crown of gold, Between the pillars before the altar, In the house of the Lord. And the King was old, And his strength began to falter, So that he lean'd on his ebony staff, Seal'd with the seal of the Pentegraph. II All of the golden fretted work, Without and within so rich and rare, As high as the nest of the building stork, Those pillars of cedar were:— Wrought up to the brazen chapiters Of the Sidonian artificers. III And the King stood still as a carven king, The carven cedarn beams below, In his purple robe, with his signet ring, And his beard as white as snow, And his face to the Oracle, where the hymn Dies under the wings of the Cherubim. IV The wings fold over the Oracle, And cover the heart and eyes of God: The Spouse with pomegranate, lily, and bell, Is glorious in her abode; For with gold of Ophir, and scent of myrrh, And purple of Tyre, the King clothed her. V By the soul of each slumbrous instrument Drawn soft through the musical misty air, The stream of the folk that came and went, For worship and praise and prayer, Flow'd to and fro, and up and down, And round the King in his golden crown. VI And it came pass, as the King stood there, And look'd on the house he had built, with pride, That the Hand of the Lord came unaware, And touch'd him; so that he died, In his purple robe, with his signet ring, And the crown wherewith they had crown'd him king. VII And the stream of the folk that came and went To worship the Lord with prayer and praise, Went softly ever, in wonderment, For the King stood there always; And it was solemn and strange to behold That dead king crown'd with a crown of gold. VIII For he lean'd on his ebony staff upright! And over his shoulders the purple robe; And his hair, and his beard, were both snow-white; And the fear of him fill'd the globe; So that none dared touch him, though he was dead, He look'd so royal about the head. IX And the moons were changed: and the years roll'd on: And the new king reign'd in the old king's stead: And men were married and buried anon: But the King stood, stark and dead; Leaning upright on his ebony staff; Preserved by the sign of the Pentegraph. X And the stream of life, as it went and came, Ever for worship and praise and prayer, Was awed by the face, and the fear, and the fame Of the Dead King standing there; For his hair was so white, and his eyes so cold, That they left him alone with his crown of gold, XI Magnificent, dead, and dread, in the House Of the Lord, held there by the Pentegraph! Until out from a pillar there ran a red mouse, And gnaw'd through his ebony staff! Then, flat on his face, the King fell down: And they pick'd from the dust a golden crown. THE DEATH OF KING HACON. I It was Odin that whisper'd in Vingolf, “Go forth to the heath by the sea; Find Hacon before the moon rises, And bid him to supper with me.” II They go forth to choose from the Princes Of Yngvon, and summons from fight A man who must perish in battle, And sup where the gods sup to-night. III Leaning over her brazen spear, Gondula Thus bespake her companions, “The feast Of the gods shall, in Vingolf, this evening, O ye Daughters of War, be encreast. IV “For Odin hath beckon'd unto me, For Odin hath whisper'd me forth, To bid to his supper King Hacon With the half of the hosts of the North.” V Their horses gleam'd white through the vapour: In the moonlight their corselets did shine: As they waver'd and whisper'd together, And fashion'd their solemn design. VI Hacon heard them discoursing—“Why hast thou Thus disposed of the battle so soon? Oh were we not worthy of conquest? Lo! we die by the rise of the moon.” VII “It is not the moon that is rising, But the glory which penetrates death, When heroes to Odin are summon'd: Rise, Hacon, and stand on the heath! VIII “It is we,” she replied, “that have given To thy pasture the flower of the fight, It is we, it is we, that have scatter'd Thine enemies yonder in flight. IX “Come now, let us push on our horses Over yonder green worlds in the east, Where the great gods are gather'd together, And the tables are piled for the feast. X “Betimes to give notice to Odin, Who waits in his sovran abodes, That the King to his palace is coming This evening to visit the gods.” XI Odin rose when he heard it, and with him Rose the gods, every god to his feet. He beckon'd Hermoder and Brago, They came to him, each from his seat. XII “Go forth, O my sons, to King Hacon, And meet him and greet him from all, A King that we know by his valour Is coming to-night to our hall.” XIII Then saintly King Hacon approaches, Arriving from battle, and sore With the wounds that yet bleed through his armour, Bedabbled and dripping with gore. XIV His visage is pallid and aweful With the awe and pallor of death, Like the moon that at midnight arises Where the battle lies strewn on the heath. XV To him spake Hermoder and Brago, “We meet thee and greet thee from all, To the gods thou art known by thy valour, And they bid thee a guest to their hall. XVI “Come hither, come hither, King Hacon, And join those eight brothers of thine, Who already, awaiting thy coming, With the gods in Walhala recline. XVII “And loosen, O Hacon, thy corselet, For thy wounds are yet ghastly to see. Go, pour ale in the circle of heroes, And drink, for the gods drink to thee! XVIII But he answer'd, the hero, “I never Will part with the armour I wear. Shall a warrior stand before Odin Unshamed, without helmet and spear?” XIX Black Fenris, the wolf, the destroyer, Shall arise and break loose from his chain, Before that a hero like Hacon Shall stand in the battle again. SIDE BY SIDE. I. (FRIEND AND FRIEND.) May we, then, never know each other? Who love each other more, I dare Affirm for both, than brother brother, Ay! more, my friend, than they that are The children of one mother. A look—and lo, our natures meet! A word—our minds make one reply! A touch—our hearts have but one beat! And, if we walk together—why The same thought guides our feet The self-same course! The flower that blows A scent unguess'd in hedgerow green, Slim spiders, where the water throws, The starry-weeded stones between, Strange light that flits and flows, Were charged by some sweet spirit, sure, (Love's minister, and ours!) to strike Our sense with one same joy, allure Our hearts, and bless us both alike With memories that endure. True friend! I know you: and I know You know me too. And this is well. Yet something seems to lie below All knowledge, which is hard to tell. The world, where hands let go, Slips in between. The warmth yet stays Where, twelve safe hours ago, no more Your soul touch'd mine. But days and days Make callous what one day leaves sore, Ichoring the wound they graze. Not ours the change, if change must fall, Nor yours the fault, nor mine, my friend! Life's love will last: but not love's small Sweet hourly lives. That these should end It grieves me. That is all. This is time's curse. Since life began It hath been losing love too fast. And I would keep, while yet I can, Man's faith in love, lest at the last I lose love's faith in man. But something sighs, “Be satisfied. “Ye know no more than ye can know.” And walking, talking, side by side, It sometimes seems to me as though Love did to love provide (How shall I say?) a man, in fine, A ghostly Third,—who is, indeed, Not you nor I, though yours and mine; The creature of our mutual need, The friend for whom we pine. You call him Me: I call him You: Who is not either you nor I: This phantom friend, whom we pursue, Released by Love's fine alchemy, Mere product of us two! The man that each in each hath sought, And each within himself hath found: The being of our separate thought, To each by his own nature bound, From his own nature wrought. Heed well our friend, while yet we may! There are so many winds about, And any wind may blow away Love's airy child. O never doubt He is the common prey Of every chance, while love remains: And every chance which he survives Is something added to love's gains. Comfort our friend whilst yet he lives! Dead, what shall pay our pains? If cold should kill his heart at last, Regret will idly muse, and think In at what window blew the blast? Or how we might have stopp'd that chink. What mends a moment past? II. (MAN AND WIFE.) Nay, Sweet! no thought, not any thought, At least not any thought of you, But what must thank dear love. Nor aught Of love's mistrust between us two Can ever creep. Thank God, we keep Too close to let thin doubts slip through, And leave a scar where they divide Hearts meant by Heaven to hold together. So, soul by soul, as side by side, We sit. Thought wanders hither, thither, From star to star, yet not so far But what, at end of all its tether, It feels the beating of your heart, To which mine bound it long ago. Our love is perfect, every part. Love's utmost reach'd at last, must so Henceforth abide. And, if I sigh'd Just now, I scarcely wish to know The reason why. Who feels love's best, Must feel love's best can be no more. We see the bound, no longer guess'd, But fix'd for ever. Lo, the shore! On either hand, 'twixt sea and land, How clear and fine does sight explore That long-drawn self-determined line Of difference traced! My Own, forgive That, sitting thus, your hand in mine, Glad that dear God doth let us live So close, my Own, so almost one, A thought that wrongs repose should strive With pure content. So much we are, Who are no more . . . . could I explain! Ah, the calm sea-coast! Think, how far Across the world came land and main, Endeavouring each to find and reach The other,—well, and they attain Here! And just here, where they unite, The point of contact seems to be The point of severance. Left and right, Here lies the land and there the sea. They meet from far: they touch: yet are Still one and one eternally, With still that touch between—that touch That joins and yet divides—the shore. Oh soul to soul, dear love, 'tis much! Love's utmost gain'd can give no more. And yet . . . Well, no! 'tis better so. Earth still (be glad!) holds Heaven in store. THE END.</field>
