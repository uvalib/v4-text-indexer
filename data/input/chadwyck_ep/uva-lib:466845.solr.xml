      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. ON A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET. The Sun is sinking, and, as he doth sink, He kisses the green brows of Earth once more, Seeming to linger over sea and shore, And, as endowed with sense, to pause, and think How lovely his own work, on ocean's brink! As if he sorrowed that his time was o'er, And gathered all his loveliness in store Into one parting glory, thence to drink Rapture unspeakable! Oh lovely sight! E'en as some angel, parting in the light And glory of his presence, from the side Of one with whom he journeyed as a guide, So sinks yon' Sun, in glory infinite, And leaves the Earth behind him sanctified! TO MY OLD FRIEND, G. S. Thou art of the salt of the earth, old friend, Thou wearëst but one face, open as day: A heart as open too! full of wise play, As is a child: yet therewith dost thou blend The deeper wisdom, which towards the end Looks ever—every flower by the way Thou pluck'st, yet go'st not for the flowers astray, But on the path of duty still dost wend! As simple as the infancy of truth: As woman mild, yet manly as a man, Mingling the lights and shades of age and youth; So tolerant, that even evil can Not vex thee: and so full of love and ruth, That thou to good turn'st what in ill began! WISDOM, HOW IT WORKS. The wise man does not wish to force things all At once to his own purpose, tho' the best: Their obstinate resistance would arrest Its progress, or it, if effectual, These break, not mend, and so the good be small— He takes things as they are, and leaves the rest To Time, the Adapter: till, grown manifest, The imperfections of their own selves fall. He works like Nature: quickens at the root, Heedless what worn-out leaves hang on the bough; Well knowing that fresh leaves and flowers will shoot, When the sap rises, tho' they seem dead now; That all will wear a livery to suit The happy time, and bear appropriate fruit! ON A NIGHTINGALE IN A CAGE, AND BLINDED. The world hath suffered much from these small things, And rued it bitterly—much cruelty, On a large scale, hath flowed unconsciously From these first, small beginnings, these first springs Of social evil, which make openings For greater—men put out the offending eye Of a poor bird, that it may gratify Their ear more sweetly, and make of its wings (Emblems of very freedom, joy, and light) A punishment! and, at the same time, too Put out the eye of pity, blind the sight Of mercy, in themselves—so, as they do, They suffer, evil: evil infinite; For want of love to all ill is the clue! LONDON. This rush perpetual confounds the sense, This everlasting scramble for the goods Of earth, this jar of busy multitudes! At the first view one loses confidence, For all seems chance, and nothing Providence— But look again: the inner plan eludes A casual glance: and not in fields and woods Alone doth God take up his residence! All this confusion soon doth disappear: Fixed laws are found at work, and Man doth Man Check and subservient keep to Heaven's great plan, While vice doth draw forth virtue and endear; And God, too great at first for human span, We clasp almost to heart, more dear and near! ERROR. Oh, there is no such thing as error, no! Nor falsehood, in the working and the frame Of Nature—nothing oversteps its aim, Nor yet falls short of it: nor couldst thou show A misplaced streak upon the daisy, tho' Thou took'st a microscope to find the same! Nothing pretends to be (the more Man's shame) What 'twas not meant, nor is it ever so— God hath not erred in aught, nor has He made One falsehood in his works so infinite. 'Tis Man who mystifies the broad daylight Of Truth, and dresses things in masquerade; And calls them by false names, the hypocrite! That he may sin, and yet seem to go right. ON GIFFORD'S PRAISE OF BEN JOHNSON'S PLAYS, “That the representation occupies scarcely an hour more on the stage, than the action would require in real life.” Critic, thou comprehendest what is made By rule and measure better than the scope Of that imagination which doth ope The world of fancy, and new realms invade; For art, if it stand still, must retrograde. Thou with inspired genius must not cope, But by the rules of Rhetoric judgest trope And figure, like thy brethren of the trade! The true aim of the drama is, t' extend Man's sympathies beyond the selfish hour He struts and frets before his little end; Therefore, it grasps him with a hand of power, And makes him Fancy's heights sublime ascend, That he may Life o'erlook, as from a tower! 'Tis not to tie him down to one poor space Or spot of earth, one paltry hour of time; As Critics, who would count the poet's rhyme Upon their fingers, and maintain, with face Profound, the unities of time and place, Assert,—No! 'tis that he the heights sublime Of universal Truth thereby may climb, And the beginning and the end embrace, The soul's diviner unity! the soul, Which knows not this or that place, neither this Nor that time, but itself of all time is! So he, whom Critics vainly would controul, Great Shakspeare held, and, well content to miss Mere local Truth, made universal Truth his goal! ON THE CHURCH CALLED “ST. JOHN'S IN THE WILDERNESS,” NEAR EXMOUTH. There is a church, in which men pray no more, Nor any voice of preacher now is heard, Save when some casual tenant is interred, Who with his fathers, buried there of yore, Would rest! yet thoughts of what it was before Invest it still with sanctity—the bird Seems stiller there, and hushed the careless word: And there Man's better thoughts, as at the door Of heaven, pause and tremble! Nature seems To hold it in her bosom, as it were, And cherish it, amid her quiet streams And hills—for holy she all things esteems, In which the thought of God has had a share, And bears in mind, that Man in mind may bear! CHEAP ENJOYMENTS. How many luxuries from day to day Have I, which cost me nothing yet at all! The very winds to me are musical, And, 'mid the leafless forest branches play Great Nature's requiem, or measures gay, Preparative to her great festival, Among the budding leaves, and pastoral Beyond the reach of the Bucolic lay— A flower to me is all the loveliness Of Nature, and a single little child The beauty of Man's life, its holiness, Its hopes and fears, its springhead undefiled; Nor can gold buy these pleasures, for the less We value gold, the more we these possess! A SEA VIEW. There loomed a sail, whitening the distant blue Of ocean: like the solitary wing Of some sea-bird, that, at his lowest swing, Brushes the foam, with flight so swift and true; No sooner did I see it than it drew My heart towards it, and, at once, did bring The ocean lone home to me, like a thing Familiar, nay, almost human too! Before, it stretched a mighty solitude, A desert of the soul, that seemed to part And sever utterly; but then my heart Seemed the great world of waters to include In its affections, and that work of art Impressed the waste with Man's similitude! GREAT POETS. The greatest minds have most of common sense, Of common feeling, and all common things; And still, beneath their high imaginings, They are as gentle and without pretence, As tho' unconscious of the difference; And still their heart capacious cleaves and clings To common ties, and, from life's household springs, Drinks, like the rest, with thirst but more intense! And tho' they, like the mountains, lift their heads Far out of reach, and out of sight, sometimes, Their unambitious greatness meekly spreads Its gentle skirts towards those lower climes, With valleys of domestic bliss, and meads Accessible, and flowery as their rhymes! TO WORDSWORTH. Thro' clouds and darkness to meridian height Of glory thou hast upward climbed, and now, In empyrëan blue, with cloudless brow, Look'st o'er a prospect clear and infinite— Rejoicing by, rejoicing in, thy light! The vapours, which at first would not allow Full view of thee, are gone, we know not how, Absorbed into thy splendour and thy might! And now, great Spirit, thou unto thy close Art hastening, and trails of glory make The heavens gorgeous for thy repose— Thou hast made day for all men to partake, And, having thought of others and their woes, Shalt be remembered now for thy own sake! ON A BUST OF DEAN SWIFT, AFTER HIS MIND FAILED HIM. Thou goodly shrine, whose roof has fallen in, Thro' its' own weight, from that majestic height! Thro' whose wide rent the intellectual light Of heaven unimpeded way doth win To desolation infinite, akin To the wreck of a world! soul-saddening sight, Of pity and of wonder infinite, A chaos, whence worlds might have origin! The lightning of thy genius smote the shrine Erected to itself, and so it lies In ruin, yet in ruin still divine, And pointing proudly upward to the skies; Whose heavenly fires alone could in such guise Deface that conjoint work of theirs and thine! MY POETRY. My verse is like the ivy, for it grows Around neglected things: to beautify The commonplace, and touch with poesy The Daily and the Homely—and it throws Its large affections, tendril-like and close, Round the familiar hopes and fears whereby The household bosom of Humanity Is touched, as round the cottage-porch the rose! And like the many-breasted Venus is My Muse—yea! she has paps and teats for all Earth's children: neither suckles she for this Or that one sect, but for Man's general Humanity at large: that none may miss Of nurture at her breasts poetical! THE TEMPLE OF TRUTH. Fling open wide the portals of the mind, And make a temple there for Truth—clear thence The pews of cold, sectarian difference, Break down the narrow lines which have confined The faith of Man, and draw up every blind Of prejudice or scant intelligence, That would shut out, from our poor, mortal sense, The light of God, for all alike designed. For, lo! Truth cometh with a multitude Behind her, and the gates must be flung wide, That she may enter in, and none exclude, But have free room to move from side to side, And spread abroad unto the general good, Wide as the daylight, from which nought can hide. TO SHAKSPEARE. Great Soul, that turnest to the healthy light Of truth not one side only, but all sides, Of thy strong mind, that nothing from it hides, But lets it, from all points, pervade it quite— Oh, thou art like the earth, with infinite Variety, yet nothing that resides Therein is out of place: with times and tides For all things, howsoever opposite! Thou hast no corners dark in thy great soul: That, like some dome majestic, from above Receives sufficient light to light the whole! Thou hast an overflowing heart of love Besides, to which, as towards the ocean, roll All streams of life, and, mingling there, improve! ON AN OLD DEFACED SIGN-POST. Point on, with silent finger, still, old post, The road to—dusty Death! thou didst ere while Point out the highway, serving to beguile The traveller's weary steps, and now may'st boast To point a moral—thou art like some ghost That starts up on a sudden in our path, Pointing at what we know not; for Time hath Defaced thee: so thy first intention 's lost. But still he puts thee to a higher use— For now thou dost mark out Life's great highway, Which all must travel still, whether they chuse Or not; so thou art still, 'midst thy decay, A solemn thing: pointing to nobler views Than statue'd columns' cloud-high tops survey! NATIONAL POWER; TO ENGLAND. Some men have won thee victories with the sword, And visible accessions of command, So that thou hold'st an empire in each hand, And east and west of men art styled Lord. But I would win thee victories with the Word, The meek and gentle Word, yet not less grand: And conquests, over more than sea and land, And triumphs, beyond any on record! Some have built up thy glory outwardly, But I would build it inwardly, on things Like the foundations of the earth and sky; Not upon gold, which maketh itself wings, But Truth and Justice, Love and Charity, The pillars of His throne, who makes and unmakes kings! THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. Old Saxon tongue, old speech my fathers spake, For earnest thoughts and earnest men right fit, Thou hast a sanctity, like Holy Writ, To me, old Tongue, wherein my heart did make Its first, articulate essays; for the sake Of many a “household word” endeared to it, And for the Muses' founts, where I would sit, (The wells of English undefiled) and take My fill! dear art thou, as the name of home, Which I first learn'd to call upon in thee; Dear for the stores which thou, their golden key, Didst open: and, oh! may I be struck dumb, When thou dost, in my mouth, aught else become But what thou art, the language of the free! MY MUSE. My Muse is Janus-faced, and looks both ways, To past and future, with an equal eye: The one being like the early morning sky, Prophetic kindling with the sun's first rays; The other, like the subdued light which plays Around him, when his golden fires die, And crimson clouds, like glowing embers, lie Along the west, reflecting still his face. Upon her twofold countenance she wears Both Hope and Memory, and, so, in view The past and all the pledges which it bears, Life's setting glories and its rising too, Still keeps—all that the furthest Future dares To hope, all Man has done, or has to do! ON THE BELIEF IN HUMAN GOOD. 'Tis better to be cheated out of gold, Than out of noble feelings and high views— This is to dry the fountains of the Muse, Lay waste, with desolation manifold, The grace of life, and loosen thy heart's hold Of all its best supports, and to refuse Thyself and all men (by one wide abuse) A recognition of the divine mould In which God made us. Loss of gold again Thou may'st replace: but not the faith divine In human worth: for this all wealth were vain; This gone, the Godhead soon forsakes the shrine, And leaves thy soul, as 'twere, a place profane, Which God and Man alike to scorn consign! POETRY OF REAL LIFE. My stream of song gushed, torrent-like and rude, From Heliconian heights, 'mid mist and cloud: Haughty at first, as tho' its pride it bowed To humbler things and lowlier neighbourhood— But now, with greater depth and plenitude Of waters, hushed it flows, and meek, not proud: With voice more reaching far, tho' far less loud, The still, deep voice of human brotherhood! Nor does it scorn, with household stream, to flow Thro' cities, or where e'er men toil for bread: Nor e'en to turn a mill! in doing so More useful far than thundering overhead; And, oh! how far more godlike, bending low To human wants, than causing idle dread! COMMON SENSE. On every side we hear of “common sense,” But find it not, or little understood; If a false estimate of Human Good: The valueing of things by pounds and pence, E'en Man's affections and intelligence: If living not for Life, but Life's mere food, Be want of common sense, how many would Be said to want it, who make most pretence! The poet, whom these men laugh at, hath most True common sense—a daisy's not worth less, In his wise view, because it naught hath cost; He thinks of all the truth and loveliness Therein, what it cost God, and God doth bless, That he Life's unbought grace hath not yet lost! His ways are ways of pleasantness: for him The clouds are painted by a hand divine: For him the sunbeams do not merely shine: The meagre, cloddy earth, to others dim, They gild, beyond the pictures painters limn, In gilded frames, the halls of kings to line, Till this poor, week-day world seems as a shrine For God, and he one of the Seraphim! He hath not “common-sense,” poor fool! and yet The million leaves that rustle in the wind, To him are tongues, to God's high praises set! And glorious sights he sees, where some are blind; Splendours and triumphs, and not counterfeit, With trails of light before, and God behind! Aye, splendours sees he, splendours, not like those Of earthly triumphs, or the courts of kings: And treasures, not those which make themselves wings, To flee away: but treasures which he knows Alone, who at sight of a flower glows And thrills, whose heart is set on divine things, To whom earth's streams are all Castalian springs, And all its week-day sights high-days and shows! And think ye, if he wanted “common sense,” That the great God would give him all this bliss, Oh, ye, whose souls are set on pounds and pence? No! he hath common sense—yea! his sense is God's common sense—divine intelligence Of Him and of his works, and all that's His TO CERTAIN PERSONS. How little charity there is in men! They will not overlook the little ill For the much good, but censure all, and kill The goodness in the bud, which, even then And there, was ripening—aye, where my pen Sinned most, it was more from the want of skill In unfledged Thought to use his wings, than will To hurt aught living, though 't were but a wren! Some of religion prate, who want its soul, That charity, the essence of the whole— Make God partake their hatred against those Who differ from them, or will not pay toll At their gates, on the road which they suppose Leads to salvation, and by “Act” inclose— But I forgive them, for his heavenly sake, Who taught us all that lesson on the cross, That to forgive is gain, to hate mere loss; And this alone is the revenge I take. For not for such as they are would I make My soul a common sewer for the dross And dregs of being, howsoe'er they gloss It over, nor let hate my peace thus break! Yes, I forgive them, and heap coals of fire So on their heads, which yet I would put out: For, whatsoever things my soul may doubt, It this believes—that charity is higher Than dogmas; and those atheists without, Who, casting Love off, cast off God entire! TO THE THAMES, ABOVE RICHMOND BRIDGE. Oh, gentle stream, that takëst with an arm Of love the meadows green by thy fair side, Encircling their verdure with a wide Embrace, and giving them their crowning charm; Far hast thou come, not spreading rude alarm, As doth a torrent, in its sudden pride Of place, but like a gentle, faithful guide, A messenger of peace, who none doth harm! Thou dost embrace the beauty of this scene As loth to part, and yet constrained away; For, 'neath the glory and the outward sheen Of Nature, she hath duties, day by day, And from her loveliest works her heart doth wean, To teach Man, like herself, how to obey! INDIVIDUAL GRIEFS. My heart hath personal sorrows to none known, Frail, selfish, fleeting, which I would not share With thee, my reader. Others, too, there are, Of higher nature, and on which is thrown, As on clouds past the eternal sun light-blown, A glory, from what we alike all share, And gleams of truth, which make them rich and rare, Even from that humanity we own In common! these are they which round the sun Of Life, with cloudlike splendors, and with trails Of glory, gather when its course is run. Yet still th' eternal light, which gilds them, fails Not even then—but, hallowing them, and none But such as they, still o'er all clouds prevails! RELIGION. 'Tis not the bending of the knee—the prayer By rote rehearsed, and, soon as said, forgot; 'Tis not to pray in one particular spot, And think profane and void all said elsewhere. It is the kneeling of the heart, as 'twere: The homage of the inmost thought, which not The majesty alone of kings, begot Of fear, could cause, nor therewithal compare. The good man hath his temple in his soul, And God to him is everywhere, but most In that same soul, there never dimned or lost: He prays too everywhere: for this great Whole Is one vast temple, to such as believe, Where they “communion” always may receive! TO CERTAIN CONVENTIONAL CRITICS. For a new poet ye can not make room, Because, at once, he falls not in his place, Nor bears your critic-rein, nor jogs your pace, Like an old roadster, hackneyed to his doom! But neigheth like a steed that from the womb Hath borne no shackles, galled with no vile trace, Nor yet bestridden by a rider base, That takes his way forthright, let what will come! The Muses' Pegasus, he scorns the rein, Nor any but her hand divine permits: Which soothes him, or enkindles him again, With its least touch. Wings too he has, as fits His calling, and the heights he must attain, Above the reach of your low-flighted wits! Aye, ye would shut him out, because his song Is strange, and hath new gifts of tongue: because Its mighty volume bears down and o'erawes Your weaker hearing, with a speech too strong; Like Ocean's voice, pent up and suffering wrong In the cramped shell, with many a break and pause: And yet (though ye yourselves know not the cause) Confounding ye, and bearing ye along! Our Shakspear made him elbow-room, and Greece Pushed, with the “Unities,” aside, to gain A stage, where his large soul could move at ease. And, though your heart be narrow as your brain, The world hath room, howe'er the Muse increase, As heaven for all the stars it should contain! ON A STANDARD ROSE, JUST PRUNED. See'st thou yon rose, which looks as though it were A naked stick, with thorns upon its stem— So little promise gives it! yet contemn It not: though thou would'st think it ne'er could bear The lovely rose, which, twined in Beauty's hair, With kindred beauty, beyond gold or gem, Enriches it: like Nature's diadem, Whose subjects are all fancies sweet and fair. But wait awhile, and it will be a thing Of beauty, the mute air then ravishing! A poet's simile for what he feels All words unequal to. So heav'n reveals Its blessings oft: which, like the desert-spring, Still meet us, where it most their source conceals. SUNSET IN THE FIRTH OF CLYDE. 1831. The sun, with golden finger, one by one, Doth touch the islands, marking out, as 'twere On a vast dial, the hours, as they wear Away in beauty; while the Day doth run Its downward course, like one who has nigh won The goal of all his glory and his care, And gathers all his splendor, to declare His coming, and the great deeds he hath done! One after one they sink back into shade: Like beacon-fires on the mountain-heights, Which tell great news, and in rotation fade; While he moves onward, making gorgeous sights, And, at his parting, in rich clouds arrayed, Blends in one glory all their shades and lights! TO ? [Oh paragon of beauty! the brute Earth] Oh paragon of beauty! the brute Earth Seems proud to bear her,—so surpassing fair! And holds her up to heaven, as it were, A sight for angels to look at, and worth Seraphic vision: proud to have given birth To so much beauty! all be-worshipp'd, there She stands, as on an eminence none dare Approach, of admiration making dearth To all besides! Is it a trick of sight, Or does the earth not lift her up on high, Exalting her, and by her infinite Perfections as exalted? In her eye And gesture she all beauty doth unite, And, gone, behind her leaves but vacancy! A SUNSET-THOUGHT. The sun is kindling with intensest light Behind yon grove, which, in the golden glow Of unconsuming fire, burns: as though It were the bush in which to Moses' sight The Lord appeared! And, oh! am I not right In thinking that he re-appears e'en now, To me, in that old glory? So I bow My head, in wonder hushed, before His might! Yea! this whole world so vast, to Faith's clear eye, Is but that burning bush, full of His power, His light, and glory! not consumed thereby, But made transparent: till, in each least flower, Yea! in each smallest leaf, she can descry His Spirit shining through it visibly! WRITTEN UPON READING THE PRECEDING SONNET, LONG AFTER IT WAS COMPOSED IN ITALY. Oh, well do I remember it: the day, The time, the clime, the spot, where I first wrote Those lines, on which my tearful eyes now dote! The mere remembrance of it still will play Like a bright halo round my head, when grey My hairs are grown, and nought else I can note! Like a remembered glory doth it float Round me, and, as transfigured, on my way I move, in blessedness unspeakable! Those lines to others are mere common-place, To me they seem, and are, a miracle: In heaven's fire I dipped my pen, to trace The words, when on me that bright vision fell, That calm, subduing glance of God's own face! WHEREIN ALL MEN MAY BE GREAT. The greatest man is not so great but we May imitate him, so far as he is A man; for to be quite a man, this, this Is in the reach of all! howe'er he be, In wealth, power, genius, raised above us, he Is but our equal as a Man: nay, his Best glory is to be so! Let him miss This brightest crown of true humanity, And he is no more great! In doing good None need be little: for the poorest can Give most, though but the crust which is his food! And he Alluding to Milton, who was greater as a man, than as a poet. whom Fancy Here used for Imagination in general., towering in her van, Made greatest Poet, by a pure heart could Become, and was, far more—a great, good Man. THE STARS. The stars come forth, a silent hymn of praise To the great God, and, shining every one, Make up the glorious harmony, led on By Hesperus, their chorister: each plays A part in the grand concert with its rays, And yet so stilly, modestly, as none Claimed to himself aught of the good thus done By all alike, each shining in his place; Each has his path, there moves unerringly, Nor covets empty fame. Do we as they: Let each soul lend its utmost light, each play, In the grand concert of humanity, Its destined part: then mankind on its way Shall move as surely as those stars on high! ON BEING MUCH ALONE. 'Tis ill to be alone: at least, in thought, Be never thou so: fancy that by thee A guardian Angel ever stands: that he Is sent by Providence, to note down aught Unworthy, thought or done, when thou deem'st naught Is near, to mark. Thus will an Angel be Really close at thy side, though thou canst see His form not; and his presence will be fraught With blessings, as if he were visible! Thus thine own thoughts grow to pure Angels here, Thy best, thy guardian Angels! and quite near, Yea, in thee, Heaven, with all its joys, may dwell! Oh, wonder! yet familiar and clear, As that each in himself doth bear the spell! LIFE. Life in itself is nothing, save as we Make use of, and enjoy, it: 'tis a dream To many: they are not, but only seem; For that which we possess not consciously, We have not! Think'st thou the rich man can be Truly possessor of the mighty stream Of wealth which flows for him? his coffers teem With absent, useless treasures: what can he Enjoy beyond that which he needs? His eyes Look coldly on the pomp which shuts his heart Up in itself, from Man's best sympathies. The magic circle, which doth all comprise, Is only, of Man's Being here, that part Which in his spirit's compass truly lies! This magic circle too is only made By Man's affections and his intellect, The which, for him, from every side collect, Like angels, missioned purposely to aid, And who by their own service are best paid, All pleasures that his sober thoughts affect. Who buildeth inwardly, wise architect, And heavenwards, although his base be laid On earth; whose top is out of reach of chance; From whence, as from a tower of watch, he takes Wide range alike o'er time and circumstance, And sees the end, and preparation makes Aforetime: his divine inheritance Not venturing for paltry, earthly stakes! Life is but as the good which we have done To others, as our feelings have been: which Are mines of endless wealth, to make us rich, Though we have nought on earth but these alone! They weave the Zone of Beauty which is thrown Round the whole world. Life is as is our Thought, As we have held that glass straight or distort; As other threads of Being with our own Have been inwoven: is, as far as we Have made our dream of it reality; As far as, with the moments speeding by, Like the waves of Eternity's vast sea, We have moved onward, ever steadily, In storm or calm, from all misgivings free! SELF-GREATNESS. The beggar's staff has often wider sway Than the king's sceptre! higher empire far, Far nobler subjects—his own thoughts, which are Best ministers of good from day to day! Content with these, still ready to obey, He, in his sphere, moves stilly, like a star Which makes all light about it, 'bove the jar Of earth's vain cares, on his eternal way. Till, thus become a spirit, spirits wait Upon him, ever 'round that viewless throne, Which He, on passions, early taught to own Wisdom's supremacy, has raised: a state Wherein celestial powers have sway alone; The Lord of his own Soul is truly great! STRONG FEELING. 'Tis well to feel on some point with both deep And during feeling—but take first good heed What that point be. Strong feeling is the seed Of all true action; if thy feelings sleep, Then thou art as the dead. Now, wouldst thou reap A harvest from thy feelings rich indeed, Wouldst thou from all vain hopes and fears be freed, Which paralyze right action, and make steep And hard the path of Virtue, then, I say, Feel deeply, but upon eternal things Alone! then will thy thoughts be like strong wings To lift thee from this Earth—thus, day by day, Wilt thou grow calmer, for the Eternal brings Its own unchangeableness with it for aye! A SUN-SET SCENE. Once more, oh! once more, let me fill mine eyes, My heart and soul, with all I gaze upon; One moment, and the vision will be gone: The gorgeous pageantry swept from the skies, As wantonly, as though but to surprise With these her wonder-works, thus briefly shown, Then snatched away, were Nature's aim alone. The stars, like lamps, in the vast dome will rise, But, where those pictures hung, light vacancy! As noiselessly as Thought all melts away; Night draws her curtain, and the landscapes die. This glorious poem of another Day, In which my Soul's a hymn, fades off for aye, This silent harmony, this music for the eye! MONEY-THIRST. Laugh on and sneer, ye money-making crew; Ye who, than wealth, no worthier aims can see: Sweeter than gold are my day-dreams to me, Though empty-pursed, yet richer far than you, Who have no use of yours; oh! tell me, who Deserves by Wisdom's lips to be called free, That unto Mammon sells himself, to be A two-fold thrall, in body and soul too! He, who to its possession would confine The ends of Life, the worth of heart and head, Deserves to taste of nothing more divine Than Gold can buy: and, in his hour of pain, To find it turn to what it is, again, To common dust, like that on which we tread! THOUGHT. What is the Warrior's sword, compared with thee? A brittle reed against a Giant's might! What are the Tyrant's countless hosts? as light As chaff before the tempest! though he be Shut in with guards, and by the bended knee Beworshiped, like a god, thou still canst smite, E'en then, with viewless arm, and from that height Hurl him into the dust! for thou art free, Boundless, omnipresent, like God, who gave Thee for his crowning-gift to Man: and when Thou work'st with thy best weapon, Truth's calm pen, To punish and reform, exalt and save, Thou canst combine in one the minds of men, Which strength like that of God, united, have! THE POET'S HARP. Oh, change the harp-strings, change them once again: For those of old, those of my heart, are now Nigh broken, and the music which would flow From them, would be so steeped in utter pain, That, if ye've hearts, ye could not bear the strain. Oh, that my soul might never speak of woe, But, like the sea-shell, echoing, here below, The might and gladness of the changeless Main, Tell of the blessedness and peace alone, And changeless durableness, of whence it came, Nor take from Man's so troubled life one tone! Like this so lovely world, which, to his Name Who made it, sings its hymn of joy, the same As at Creation's dawn, ere Man made moan? A SUNSET THOUGHT. What is it that mine eyes look on? some bright And radiant Angel, from the setting sun, Alighting on yon hill? No: 'tis but one Of Earth's poor dwellers, whom the Heaven's light Has steeped in its own glory, till to sight He seems transfigured: but the glory's gone, And there he stands, a simple Man alone, The halo faded from his brow. Like might, Yea! more, hath virtue! She can lasting make That glory: can transfigure, inwardly, The Mortal, till the Angel's form he take, And be, not seem—till, ever in God's eye, From his whole being its clear light will break, And he be as a prism to test truth by! WHAT MAKES US RICH? That which we consciously possess, alone, Is ours, that only is real wealth: of all That lavish Fortune wastes on us, how small A portion can be truly called our own! Beyond Life's simpler wants, supplied, that on High cares the soul may dwell, how much we call Our own is not possessed! the splendid hall And banquet we can scarce enjoy for one Feast-night: and, quicker than the flowers, which Festooned the walls, they fade from memory! Such things may make us seem a moment rich, But only seem; they serve but to bewitch The sense: real blessings are not for the eye: They ask a sober soul, far 'neath the surface lie. Their roots both sound and deep must be too: they Must firmly grasp this common Earth, whereon We live, and from which we can raise alone The daily Bread, for which each heart should pray, Its most familiar affections; yea! For from these only, 'neath the blessed sun, Man's happiness is drawn; else God has done Wrongly to frame us thus, and bid us say, “Our Father” even to himself, before All meaner names! What is a Bible bound With gold, to him who feels its blessed lore, Its meaning? It exists not—he has found The one true vein of Life's enriching ore, And with that, neither wants, nor wishes, more! And tell me, once again, oh! what is all The pomp and glitter of the world, to one Who feels its meaning, lives in that alone, Full of this sublime consciousness? how small, How worthless, in his sight, could he recall Their nothingness to mind, while gazing on The golden stars, hung, like bright lamps, upon The coigns and vaults of this vast, sky-domed hall: Which is his dwelling-place, how poor soe'er He be, a palace beyond that of kings! Yea! more: a temple, where, throughout the year, Each day's a sabbath, and where he can hear The preacher preaching ever, and where Spring's Own hand unto the mighty Altar brings The wreath, which Earth doth in his honour wear! Yea! it is worthless, as unto him is The golden binding, who kneels down and prays, And, thinking only of his mission, says “Our Father, which art in Heaven!” does he miss The “golden binding,” the outside, which this Weak age adores, to whom the world displays Its beauty, who, therein, has all Earth has To give him, with foretaste of Heaven's bliss! And what (would we partake with him) should we Then seek? the inner wealth, which makes us free And godlike! till all else seems drossy, base, Unfit of during worth to take the trace: Treasures, which those around us cannot see, Yet strewed before our feet throughout all space! What too do we most consciously possess, At all times, in all places, ever on The same? our Minds, our Hearts, our ownselves! yes! These make us rich: and he is so alone, Who o'er himself rules free from all excess: O'er his own Thoughts! he who feels not his own Self, consciously, if I may so express My thought, exists not, and true life has none! Possess thyself then consciously: thus thou Wilt have, and be, the Godlike, which thou art; For God's own Spirit dwells in thee e'en now; And, feeling this, what more can human heart Desire? for, where God is, is Heaven too: And what have earthly things, where heavenly are, to do? TO ? [O lips to shape sweet sounds formed so, express] O lips to shape sweet sounds formed so, express, I would I were a smile, the happy smile, About them ever, so to be the while Near them, and in reach of such blessedness! Methinks the commonest words, as no, or yes, From them like heavenly résponses beguile, And make of other lips the music vile, Seeming deficient, or else in excess! Like the lark are they in their notes of gladness, And like the nightingale in their sweet sadness: Thrilling the soul, in each delicious measure, With sense of rapture almost to sweet madness: Unlocking all the avenues of Pleasure, And many a secret door to hidden treasure! SOLITUDE. O Solitude! divinest Solitude! Long, at thy genial breasts, have I drawn in The milk of wisdom, far from all vain din Of the World, fretting in its noisy mood! Long nourished upon that celestial food, I feel each troubled pulse, which throbbed within My heart, grow quiet, and, at length, begin To comprehend the sublime plenitude Of charms severe which dwell in that calm face! No wonder that the crowd should fly from thee, Since I myself but now begin to trace Beauties unfelt before—from the vain chace I turn aside to where, by the great sea, Thou sitt'st alone, thou and Eternitie! THE TWO-FOLD LIFE. Oh, happy time, ere yet the youthful heart Has quite subsided in the sober tone Of manhood, yet can call those joys its own In which that sober manhood claims most share! Those thoughtful pleasures, mingled, with fine art, With the naîve impulses which loosed the zone Of all life's virgin charms, which make them (known And tasted) sweet as at the first, fresh start! Oh, happy time! when, children at heart still, Yet with the sobered soul and well-schooled will, We of the child retain the innocence And simpleness, with the maturer sense Of many years, and from life's flowers distill The essence, to make sweet hours long, long hence! A NIGHT-THOUGHT. There shines a star in, like a loving eye, In at the window, solemn, still, and bright, Gazing down on me from its azure height, On me! an atom in infinity: A little dust, the winds anon will dry And scatter, while it shines on with calm light! And yet it is a world, though to my sight So little: yet the little am but I! And yet, O God, there is a mighty chain, Which links me with yon star, small though I be, And which from world to world vibrates again, However lightly touched, aye, e'en by me— Aye, vibrates onward through the starry train, And stops, and recommences still, with Thee! THE SEEMING BEGGAR. A tatter'd, wayworn beggar! verily To sight it seems so; but how do ye know That gifts of glory, passing outward show, May not be hid 'neath rags and poverty? He hath asked nought of thee, and passes by Like one who reverence to himself doth owe, A soul built up with that which makes most low! And haply he hath more, than you or I, To give of that wherein all worth doth dwell; If we were stripped, we might the poorer seem. And God, when he would work a miracle, Even with such as these, whom men esteem The outcasts of society, loves well Poor, scorned Humanity from insult to redeem! THE WISE MAN CANNOT BE IMPOVERISHED. Talk not of loss! the wise man can lose naught, So long as he is himself! nay, the more He loses of those hollow goods, before Which weak minds bow, the more his soul is taught That wealth alone is during, which is wrought From his own bosom's mine of divine ore; The more he is himself, the richer store Springs from the native soil of his own thought! 'Tis but when forced into ourselves, that we Find and become the Godlike we should be; Then no more upon Fortune's brittle reed, Shaken by every breath, we lean, but free And fearless, with Faith's steady staff proceed, Which bears us up secure in life's worst need! THE PEN. With this, as little as it seems, can one Work wonders! build up cities, plough the waste, Alter costumes and laws, and change the taste Of nations, set up thrones, and pluck them down! What privilege then claims it as its own? Or what strange subjects 'neath its sway are placed, That thus, with a few strokes, can be effaced Things grey as Time, familiar as the sun? Men's thoughts! these move all! act but on the thought And will of Man, and then thou may'st apply The lever which has mightiest changes wrought, With thy one, poor, weak hand! lost to Man's eye Perhaps, like God, by few or known or sought, Thou with two fingers mov'st the world's machinery! TIME. Oh Time, who musest by the grave, and on The brink of dark Forgetfulness, in whose Unfathomable depths thou fling'st all those Vain records still, which testify alone Of thy gifts misapplied, on that grave-stone Why sitt'st thou with thine hourglass, which shows But few, small grains, yet measures out all woes, Cares, toils, how great-soe'er, beneath the sun: Whose moments, busy workmen! forge the chain Of stern necessity, that binds as well The bosom-cradled babe through joy and pain, As the vast life of nations; thou could'st tell Strange secrets of that grave, which must remain Voiceless, and with the worms for ever dwell! FOLLY AND WISDOM. Thus may one know the fool from the wise man: Give to the former all that hope can crave, All that, between the cradle and the grave, The ever-busy fancy's brain can plan, The end will find him such as he began, Unformed within, unchanged in all things, save Grey hairs and wrinkles; let the other have Of stern reality the scantiest span, With means commensurate, yet therein he Can fashion forth a world of beauty, make Mere earthly things subserve Eternity: He, in sublime content, Want's bread will break As 'twere the bread of immortality, Yea! Faith to that can change it for his sake! DEATH. Oh Death! no poet ever called on thee For inspiration, or thy cypress-bough Plucked, in the Laurel's stead, to crown his brow; Yet thine is of the two the best, 'tis free From poison: and those who have learnt to see Aright will tell thee also, there is no, No place where the true evergreen will grow, Surer than on the grave, where Flattery Is dumb. Truth's ear is in the inmost heart, And the loud voices of the world are there Unheard: nor over-joy nor blank despair To it true revelations can impart; But thou, oh Death, when softened thy first smart, Canst whisper things unutterably fair! CHILDREN, HOW TO BE TREATED. How lovely! lo! the sunbeams 'round the head Of yon' soft-sleeping child are thrownd, as 'twere An halo 'round a new-born Angel! dare To think so: and, when that bright wreath has fled, Let bold Imagination, in its stead, Behold that far diviner crown, still there, Of its own innocence! this let it wear Constantly in thy sight, that thou may'st tread As in an angel's presence, ever so Regarding it; nor, then, wilt thou be wrong: For treated as such, such 'twill really grow, And then a little angel will belong To thee; and, as one flower doth spring fore-show, So 'round thee with thy child all heaven shall throng! WE HAVE ALL WE CAN HAVE, IF WE PLEASE. Who thinks that future gains or goods will make Him happier than he is, or can be, now, Though living by the sweat of his own brow, Is much mistaken—all things from us take Their value: and the coarse bread, for whose sake We toil, does to that very labour owe Blessings the bread of ease can never know: What is more sweet than water, if it slake Real thirst? and what can slake so well the real And divine thirst of heart, as feelings pure And simple? the sole thirst that can endure: In calm self-consciousness lies Man's true weal: And with this thou art neither rich nor poor, But godlike! for 'tis God that thou dost feel! ON DOING GOOD. Who thinks that with gold only he can do Real good is half a fool—alas! what would Be then the lot of all the poor: the good And suffering spirits, left too oft to rue The tender mercies of the rich?—the true Well-doers are not those who really should Do most for their poor brethren, and who could, If God had planned this fair world so that through Wealth only its chief blessings could be won; The poor are the well-doers: they still aid Each other feelingly, without parade, Nor make an insult of the good thus done. The beggar gives the penny he has laid By for himself—godlike, as God alone! TRUE STRENGTH. Who is the happy warrior may draw The sword of God, and wield it in His name? One, like Himself, without reproach or blame: Whose ends, like heaven's own, are free from flaw! He from its scabbard may pluck forth, in awe And holy fear, that sword, which, as a flame, Shall wither up his foes: then, whence it came, Replace it with all speed; for not in war Doth Wisdom show her true supremacy; From out the waste of Chaos to create Calm fabrics, like the mansions of the sky, To base on virtue an enduring state: This is her nobler task, her office high; War makes the sudden mighty, peace th' enduring great! It is not strength of nerve or sinew may Draw forth God's sword, though Hercules should try: Yet to the chosen touch, which to the sky For sanction looks, yea! to a maid's essáy, As erst to Joan of Arc's, 't will straight give way: And with it they may work their mission high; But, should their hearts be touched with vanity, Ambition, or from the dírect end stray, Its strength departs from it: it works no more Than brittle steel in mortal hand; for ne'er In grasp impure hath it celestial power To lasting things; brute strength of sinew here Over its like may triumph, but before Invisible strength it bows in awe and fear. ON THE COLUMNAR APPEARANCE OF THE SUN SETTING OVER THE SEA. There is a column, such as was not wrought For Solomon's grand temple, stone and gold, And marble, though most wondrous to behold: Though taxing human power and human thought, And all earth's treasures, for its glory sought! O God, if I to ask may make so bold, What wondrous temple was it made to uphold, There lying, as not to completion brought! And my soul whispers: it was made for this Day's holy temple, fading soft away, While the light wind its cloud-cap'd dome doth kiss, And breaks it into gorgeous disarray— Yet still that golden column witnesses Of its surpassing glory, in decay! THOUGHTS IN THE SUNSHINE. The sun is shining, and he turns to gold The sand, the common dust, beneath my feet, Great Alchymist! with his transforming heat Subliming all things into something grand Or beautiful: with power beyond the hand Or thought of Man; vain dreams, now obsolete, Thus realizing, in a way more meet And true, for those who will but understand! Then understand it, Reader—oh behold It so, and thou all things transformed to gold Shalt see—to something far more precious too, Into the Beautiful, the Good, and True! A higher Alchymy than that of old, Applied to uses as sublime as new! THE SCHOOLING OF THE HEART. How hard it is to school the human heart To that sublime—no! not indifference, For that is but a death with the pretence Of life—but to that patience, which takes part In all Man's cares and griefs, yet has the art To draw its noblest triumphs even thence: From every sacrifice its recompence, And from the wound a med'cine for the smart! Till (like some old cathedral-tower, high In air, that, when the hymn hath left the ears Of men below, its music heavenlier hears, Unmixed with aught of earth, far up the sky) We catch the music of Humanity, Without the jar of its brief cares and fears! ON THE EFFECTS OF MACHINERY. Were all these means and rich appliances Meant merely to enable Man to make More money, not for the diviner sake Of his immortal Being, that, through these, It might enlarge with spiritual increase! Then could I wish that ye might ever wake And watch, and Mammon's wages only take, And make but gold, who for it mar your peace— These things were meant to give Man's soul more time To look about it, and unto the heights Of spiritual Being oftener climb— To bring within the reach of all delights Confined yet to the few, and give sublime Direction to the Spirit's daily flights! MY PLEASURE-GROUND. I covet not your gardens—what these are Unto the flowers in your window-sill, Or drawing-room, themselves are (and not ill So likened) to that garden, larger far, And fairer, where I walk without a bar Or hindrance: where I pay naught, yet am still More richly entertained than kings, with skill Divine, and splendor truly singular! Rivers flow for me, mountains lift their heads, And in their laps her flowery skirts Earth spreads Accessible—the clouds for me are sights Beyond kings' pageants, and, where-ever treads My foot, as at its touch, spring new delights, And music, filling earth's depths and heaven's heights! ON A CHURCH, COVERED WITH IVY AND VIRGINIA CLIMBERS, AND OTHER PLANTS. Oh blessed union of holiest things, The innocence of Nature hand in hand With all that is in Man most pure and grand! Oh marriage beyond all imaginings, Whence offspring, and most lawful issue, springs, Beauty and Holiness, as from the wand Of magic: yet by no such vain command, But by His power who, only, such spells flings! Oh outward emblem of an inward bond And union between things close-allied, Whose form should with their spirit correspond— So in our inward worship, side by side With all its awfulness, a grace, beyond E'en that, should be, through love, not fear, to guide! ON LEAVING A PLACE WHERE I HAD PASSED SOME YEARS. Dear Spot, I now must leave thee, and forsake The scene of many labours and much love— Gold have I spent, and Labour, far above All Gold: which makes what Gold could never make, Nor itself do, if but for Gold's poor sake— And Love, the crown of Labour, which doth move And quicken it, on itself to improve, And after its divine exemplar take! But richly hast thou paid me back for all My labour and my love: aye, thousandfold, With more than idle fame, or idler gold— By thus enabling me, in natural And useful wise, my Being to unfold, To love and labour still, Man's twofold call! GOD, THE GREATEST POET. God is the greatest poet, and, like all True poets, maketh weekday poesy— He paints the clouds of heaven gorgeously, As if to paint them were his only call: Yet 'tis their use makes them poetical! Their use great as their beauty to the eye, Needful to earth as lovely to the sky; And so through all His labours, great or small! He seeks not vain display, but blendeth Use With Beauty, in a twofold loveliness: That thus one thing in many ways may bless, Serve many ends—so, after Him, the Muse: Who teaches Truth divine, but in the dress Of Fancy, that she wider may diffuse! ON THE OCCUPATION OF SINDE. Thine honor is an Ægis more secure Than fleets or armies, O my Country dear: And faith and justice cause more righteous fear In the offender and the evildoer, Than the brute terrors which not long assure (And only while their instruments are near,) An unjust usurpation: whose career Hath ending violent and premature, Like its beginning—thou wilt soon repent Thine error, in the loss of confidence, Which doth a kingdom more than arms cement; Yet, whatsoever be the consequence, One loss is certain: loss of that high sense Of justice, which is thy worst punishment! ON DANBY'S PICTURE OF “CALYPSO'S GROTTO.” The sun is sinking, and o'er sea and shore Throws the long shadows of the cliffs and trees, With gleams of lingering brightness betwixt these, Like pillars of pure gold, that erewhile bore The dome of day up, which is now no more, Fallen in gorgeous fragments—ill at ease, Lo! towards her grotto sad Calypso flees, For she her lost Ulysses doth deplore— A solemn sadness breathes poetical O'er all: and we, unconscious of the art, Which human griefs to things material Transferring, makes them suffer with Man's heart, Grow sad, and in that sorrow too take part, Until the grief of one grows that of all! REAL VALUE; SUGGESTED BY A FIGURE IN CLAY, OR “TERRA COTTA,” BY M. ANGELO. Things have a spiritual worth, beside, And far beyond, all money-value too— Thus, e'en a piece of clay, which has passed through A Michael Angelo's fingers, beautified By his allmighty touch, to God's allied, (For it creates, and breathes Soul into new And godlike forms, and vileness doth endue With value) hath a worth which will abide— E'en in this worldly traffic it is worth More than its weight in gold, though paltry earth; Gold is but mere brute metal: but it bears God's impress in its Beauty, and thenceforth, So long as in aught heavenly Man shares, 'Twill touch his heart, and breathe celestial airs! TO MILTON. I am but as a star that in the sky Doth lowly shine, just on the horizon's rim, Lighting a scanty space, and that but dim; The whereabouts of meek Humanity, The little, household circle, which doth lie Within reach of the least: aye, e'en of him Whose daily life doth make his God a hymn Divine, though heard not by the passer by! A little nook, encompassed by the heart And its affections, as in God's own arms! But thou dost shine high up, and far apart, Gilding our troubled Life's alternate calms And storms, and as a beacon there thou art, Beheld of all, mighty in many charms! POETRY OF REAL LIFE. My Muse's wings are clipped, and, Reader, so A sort of household and poetic Lar, Whose whereabouts are all familiar And homewards, she has grown—she does not go To distant lands, nor debts to fancy owe, For things which at her feet already are— Where Men are, themes poetic are not far: Hard by the door her springs Castalian flow! They are the household wells we use each day: The streams by which the children gather flowers, With towns and cities on their further way— All Heliconian streams, with gifts and powers Of song divine, although those powers may Turn factory-mills, or work at stated hours! CHILDREN. A little child is as a fount of good: A well in the waste places on life's way, The sad Zaharas where love doth decay— He is a mediator, and endued With pow'r to bring together hearts that stood Apart: a bridge across life's gulfs—with gay And artless weaning turning into play And pleasure tasks on which we else should brood. He makes one laugh, another play, and all (Who feel aught) love: Love itself good immense; His smiles too on our way like sunshine fall, The sunshine of the heart: thawing the sense Of all life's beauty, and things apt to pall Refreshing to our worn experience. WORLD-MUSIC: ESOTERIC. There is a music which I love to hear Beyond all other music 'neath the sky, The deep, sweet music of Humanity; Falling for ever on mine inward ear, From ages past, and choiristers now here No longer, yet whose voices, sweet and high, Like a “Te Deum” to the Deity, Fill the wide world, his temple, far and near! Long had I, at the gates, sat listening, Not daring yet to enter in, nor quite Conceiving whence those blessed sounds could spring. But now I, with a concourse infinite, Have entered in at last, and with them sing And shout Hosannas, worshipping aright! SEARCH OF TRUTH. Of moral Truth the “mare magnum” I, Far-traversing, have sailed o'er many-a day, Since first I voyaged on my lonely way, Embarking hopes of immortality And fame in this frail bark of poesy! Far out of sight of land, and those who play With danger near the shore, I still essáy The venture, sailing ever by the sky! Yet, on my course, I touch at many-an isle, And water at each Heliconian spring, Whose fresher taste the voyáge may beguile— That so the end of my adventuring May pleasure bring as well as use, the while Of Truth's yet undiscovered lands I sing! HAMPTON-COURT-PALACE, AT SUNSET; AUGUST. Another holy day is dying out— Gilding the towers of Hampton with new gold, Fresh from the eternal pallet, as of old, When Wolsey bade them with their presence flout The palaces of kings, and put in doubt Whether great Nature in more regal mould Than that of kings themselves cast not his bold And scheming mind, great ends to bring about— How quiet on those towers the last rays Of sunset linger! as if, for awhile, Great Nature paused to hallow the displays Of human genius with a parting smile! So will she linger still, Man and his ways To gladden, and with hers to reconcile! ON A NEW-DISCOVERED AND UNINHABITED LAND. Here, in her first, untouched virginity, The fresh Earth laughs—here never woo'd by less Than the all-circling Air, who doth possess Her ear at all times with his flattery; And by the Ocean in his majesty, Who now, with sighs, her wave-kissed feet doth press, And now, when winds his azure brows caress, Shakes with his nod, like Jove, both Earth and Sky! Here heaves she upward to Air's warm embrace Her many-breasted Alluding to the Venus ??????????. bosom, like a new Venus of old Mythology, whose place She better fills—and, as the Sea doth woo Her feet, she on him downward bends her face Divine, her favours sharing 'twixt the two! WHOM TO PLEASE. True men and upright, of whate'er degree, With sweating brow, or crown upon your head, True sons of your great Father, missionëd To do his work of love, to bind and free, Who, like Saint Peter, hold the mystic key; Who work his miracles, but words instead Of spells make use of, quickening the dead, The dead in soul, who deadest of all be! Dearer to me your good opinion is Than the poor plaudits of the ignorant crowd, Groundless as hasty, brief as they are loud; For Conscience, which but echos Him in this, Who lifts the meek up, and puts down the proud, Approves your sentence, and confirms it His! ON THE DEATH OF AN OLD DOG. Thou honest servant, friend, of many years, Thy loss doth that of worldly goods transcend— I loved thee: and we love not to no end Or use, nor twine our human hopes and fears Round the least thing in vain, nor shed vain tears Even for thee—for so my heart doth send A recognition after thee, old friend, Due to thy love, and of mine the arrears! Thou hast departed, and thy clear, frank eye, Void of suspicion as of guile, no more Looks up into my face inquiringly— Yet that in thee which loved, as it before Thy time existed, will eternally, For Love 's of God, whatever shape it bore! TO THE MUSE OF POETRY. O Muse, thy nourishing, which unto some Is but as manna in the wilderness: Found but in seasons of their strange distress And sorrow, which unseal lips elsewhile dumb, And make the waters in dry places come, The heart's Castalian springs! to me is less Than this, yet more, the daily bread I bless And live on, household bread and made at home! And if, with no profane comparison, Reader, I break and offer it to thee, 'Tis as a sacrament, a sublime one, The sacrament of Man's Humanitie! Of which partaking, I would have thee none But as thy Brethren view, whate'er they be! BY THE SEA-SIDE, ON A STORMY DAY. What might and majesty is in their path! Onward and onward come the bounding waves, Still making, as they rise and sink, new graves, For their own brief-lived selves, yet with fresh wrath Rerising, as who a new spirit hath Gained even from his fall—each, sinking, paves His fellow's path, and then a like fate braves, Still trembling in the scales of life and death! Thou many-voicëd Ocean, thou, who hast The gift of mighty utterance, speak thou true To Earth, and bid her think upon the past— Bid her kneel down before thee, as men do In penance, as God were about to cast Thy spray upon her brow, baptizing her anew! ON DANTE. The Cardinal du Pujet, the Pope's Legate in Lombardy, wished to disinter and burn Dante's body, and scatter his ashes to the winds, but was prevented by some influential citizens. O Dante, when I gaze on that stern face, Where seated Grief sits mocking Sympathy, The smileless lip, the glazed, long-tearless eye, Which for its own ills never wept, I trace, Graved as in marble, not the commonplace, And hourly sorrows of humanity, But those which all the founts of tears updry, And turn the forc'd smile to a sad grimace— And were not these enough? did then thy foes Seek other triumphs? yes! they would thy soul In heav'n, thine ashes in the grave, controul!— But from their depths, solemn and stern, there rose A voice, an echo of the mighty Whole, Forbidding Man 'twixt Man and God to interpose! MIDNIGHT. OCTOBER 24TH. The moon has sunk—unutterably bright, Meanwhile, the stars have gathered, one by one, And never, to my eye, so bright they shone; How stilly each, content with its own light, Moves onward, not obtruding on the sight Its glories, as if it alone had done Its mission, but so modestly, as none Were less or greater, claiming but its right! O God! how still is ocean, land, and sky! As Contemplation held her breath to pray; On Air's soft breast Earth seems as if it lay Hushed like a child, and the great Sea doth lie With it, like twins, that slumber after play, And o'er all looks, still as a star, God's eye! LOVE. Love, whilom, volant from his native sky, Brushed me, by chance, with his ambrosial wings, Which shed enriching sweetness on all things: And fanned me, as he went, revivingly, With airs from heaven which still round him fly: And wrapped me in an atmosphere, that clings E'en now to me, and magic round me flings, Making my footsteps musical and high, Like to a God's! alas! or ere he came The world seemed flat, unprofitable all; But now the commonest things have scope and aim Divine: Man's daily voice sounds musical As is Apollo's lute, and Woman's name Doth Beauty, like a spell, before me call! O Love, enriching Love, that mak'st a flower, A faded flower, worth more than jewels are, And to vile things giv'st value singular: Oh! thine, thine is the Beauty and the Power, Who turn'st a rustic seat into a bower Of fairy bliss: who makëst treasures far, Far beyond gold, from things familiar, And with thyself dost far more richly dower Peasants than queens without; thou, like the sun, Dost gild the earth, and strew it o'er with wealth Unspeakable, and doest good by stealth: Enriching all, yet poor not making one! Those who want thee, want so both wealth and health, And, having all things, yet have use of none! PREMIER-REVOLUTIONISTS: ON THE CORN-LAWS. They most a state's foundations sap, who take From Law its reverence, from Power its love: Their highest attributes, from Him above Derived direct, and holy for His sake! Samsons, who, with misguided power, shake That temple, which not might of hosts could move: And that which most upholds, by which it throve, The pillar of Justice (putting all at stake) Pluck on themselves and others—these alone Are truly revolutionists: who burst Asunder, with mad strength, the holy zone Of Order, which nought else could do or durst; Which round Man's life, like Venus' Cestus, thrown, Hath all its social charms and graces nurst! HOW TRUTH WORKS. Although not theoretically best, Nor yet embodying the truth entire, Some social forms are to be kept, till higher And purer spring from Truth more manifest— To speak large truths demands a mighty chest, Expanded to the full by high desire, With strong-breathed lungs, and sustained voice of fire, And the large utterance of the social breast. A larger Truth enlargëd forms demands, The work of no one, individual Will, But of unnumbered, ceaseless hearts and hands— And, as in one broad stream flows many-a rill, The boundary-line, which washes mighty lands, So truths the channel of Opinion fill! THE VERY RICH. The richest are but stewards for the rest, When on themselves they take the management And trouble of their wealth: by them but spent, Enjoyed by others, with more peace and zest; Free from the cares which the possessor's breast Annoy: the envy and the discontent: The litigation, and the distrained rent, The waste, remediless though manifest. And, when they on themselves take not the care Of their own wealth, a greater care it grows; For they are robbed by parasites, and bear Their treasure in distrust, with gilded woes Bemocked at heart—so have they far less share Than he who little has, but its use knows! The Duke of Devonshire, at cost immense, Maintains his princely gardens for the use Of his head-gardener: who doth amuse Himself therein, and, at the Duke's expense, Joys to the full, each day, his every sense; The true possessor of all that he views: Who calls it his, with princely revenues Of more than gold, of high intelligence, Of beauty and of pleasure! without cost All his: nay, he is paid for having what Unto the Duke himself is almost lost! Such compensations has Man's inward lot, And richest those who énjoy, not have, most; So outward difference of rank weighs not! TO SIR JOHN HANMER. I cannot refrain from paying my poor tribute of admiration to one, who, in his “Strategy of Death,” and his Sonnets, has given proofs of his being a poet of the first order, and who, I trust, if true to himself, will leave a name second to none. O poet with the lyric fancy, Swan, That on the Heliconian stream of song Warblest adown its waves, with voice both strong And sweet, and far, like morning, in the van Of this our darkness: with its source began Thy strains, which, gathering, as they went along, New powers, now, superior to wrong, The ocean greet with corresponding span. Soon wilt thou be afloat on that wide sea Of poesy, far out of sight of strand Or haven, like him whose great thought first spanned The western World; so shall this age in thee Find a discoverer of many-a land Poetic, to the Muse made tributary! I am but as the morning star, whose light Doth usher in the day, and then is lost; Not like the star of eve, which leads the host Of heaven on, amongst them shining bright, And for the service more a favorite— But what of that: my loss is yet my boast: That I make known a greater at my cost, Content in him to shine, though out of sight! Alas! how slow the world is to admit A poet to his place among the kings Of song, but letteth him neglected sit Beneath the shade which his own laurel flings. But in that mighty shade, unheard by it, Like the great sea in the lone night, he sings! MAMMON. There's blood upon thee, thou accursed Gold! And yet thou goest free, and current art, As thou in all these social ills no part Hadst ever taken; as thou hadst not sold And bought up slaves, nor given Greed firm hold Of his poor victim: nor plucked out the heart Of true love, sold like vile wares i' the mart, Nor murdered, with pains slow and manifold, Thine o'erworked thralls! get hence, thou hypocrite, That look'st so open-faced, so pure, and bright: Thou legal coin of the realm, that yet dost break The law which makes thee current: for whose sake Men sell their fellows, body and soul, outright, And flesh and blood by the pound, like Shylock, take ANSWER TO A QUESTION. Thou ask'st me: “for how much I'd rob that nest, Or hurt that poor bird: for what sum of gold, A thousand pounds: ten thousand: wealth untold?” How poor a view of Man's true interest, And of his Being's scope, thy words suggest! To ask if his best feelings could be sold At any price, or if he wealth would hold At price of being beggared in his breast, Beggared at heart! great God, I would not harm That poor bird's nest for worlds; my human soul Would, more than an housebreaker, take alarm, At forcing thus the sanctuary of this whole Sweet world, and robbing thence its inward charm, Its inner meaning, Wisdom's furthest goal! Aye, this were truly to annihilate The rich reward of many thoughtful years: The truth, which in the well (whose waters tears, Long settled, are, long chastened and sedate) At bottom still is found, and ever late, After long search, and many hopes and fears, The compensation full for all arrears, Which Time has suffered to accumulate! Thou might'st as well pluck out at once thy heart, As entertain the thought such act to do; For then of this fair world thou 'rt no more part And parcel: thou hast lost the inner clue: Thou art in outer darkness: blind thou art, Blind, not of eye alone, but of heart too! SPRING. The trees are bursting as in rivalry: Blossom gets start of leaf, yet, while I speak, The leaf appears—yon' rose its glowing cheek Leans on the honeysuckle sisterly, And, hiding, makes its beauty more thereby! The birds have cleared their pipes, as if to seek Their sweetest notes, and harmonize their beak To the dear season and its witchery. Methinks the universal heart around Doth beat most audibly: as not alone Things animate, but senseless, feeling found. The air seems like the just unloosened zone Of Earth's virginity, the which, unbound, Diffuses all her charms at once, full-blown! TO A FRIEND; ON AN OLD TREE, WITH PRIMROSES GROWING OUT OF IT. OCTOBER 24, 1833. Old oak, upon thy mossy surface grow Sweet primroses, like Beauty on the arm Of Power leaning, an unwonted charm Imparting to thy leafless trunk, to show How gentlest things from strongest sources flow! Destroy them not—perhaps at April's warm Approach, when bees and birds begin to swarm, Thou wilt rejoice at heart to see them blow! On such an eve, beneath that very tree, Thou may'st be seated, thinking on the past, Thy wife beside, thy child upon thy knee— Then may'st thou pluck those sweets thou now would'st cast Away, taught thus to let the least thing be, By the delight which thou from wise forbearance hast! ON M. ANGELO. When M. Angelo left Florence to build the dome of St. Peter's, he turned back to admire the noble cupola of the Duomo, as it rose, in the twilight of day-break, from amid the pines and cypresses above the city, exclaiming, “Come te non voglio, meglio di te non posso—” It is the grey of morning—from his wing The lark its dew is shaking—the last star Glimmers upon th' horizon's verge afar, 'Twixt night and morn, like a dream lingering Upon Aurora's eyelids, ere she fling Slumber quite off! amid the cypress-trees And pines, which round the city's brows, the breeze Stirs, like a coronal, the dome doth spring— More like the baseless fabric of a cloud, Floating in air, than aught conceived by Man, And now with golden halos from the shroud Of night emerging—back he turned to scan The sight sublime, and saw, with faith endowed, Afar, the rival dome's sublimer span! ON A LOVELY SUNSET. Soft o'er the earth the rosy eye of Day, Like God's, once more is closing: gently as The daisy shuts beneath me in the grass! A few light cloudlets linger on their way, To gold and crimson turning, then to gray, As onward, one by one, they slowly pass— The last, rich touches the great painter has Imparted to them, as it were, in play! How lavishly the poorest, work-day cloud In richest tints is steeped, until it seem A mantle of which monarchs might be proud— Each has fulfilled its task in the great scheme Of things, yea, e'en the least: and God aloud Proclaims it, as this fair day's closing theme! ON THE THAMES, NEAR HAMPTON COURT. Here glides the Thames 'twixt meadows still and green, Unconscious of the turmoil and the fret Which, further on, his prouder path beset— Here Nature reigns, an undisputed queen, Art dares not trespass on her still demesne; Or, if she does, 'tis as an anchoret, The world and the world's ways so to forget, And grieving that such follies should have been— The hills, with cloud-like undulations, make Th' horizon vague, while the stream, far away, Lingers, as loth our sight yet to forsake— Not yet doth Commerce in thy broad lap play, Thy foster-child, old Thames, nor strive to break His leading-strings, and higher flights essáy. TIME-SERVERS. Who lives upon opinion, lives but by The breath of others' mouths, not by his own— His very soul, by which Man lives alone, Is pawned, and hourly gives itself the lie— He dares not lift his hand, or laugh, or cry, Save upon precedent—yet such I've known, Who tune their shallow pipes to every tone, Playing all stops with like facility— 'Twere worse than death such borrowed air to draw; In their own nostrils such men's breath must smell— 'Tis rank: for it must first have passed the maw Of commonest opinion, ere they (faugh!) Will breathe it, whose souls are the vehicle Of that at which a beggar's gorge would swell! POPULARIS AURA. Statue in temples want not I, nor crown Of bay-leaves on my brow, to spread my name Abroad, and make me heir to vulgar fame— By the loud trumpet of full-tongued Renown I would not have my praises rankly blown, With popular breath, which, as it oft will blame Lightly best things, oft praises worst the same, Its smile more fatal ever than its frown— These want I not—but when, on their proud height Of triumph, great ones fill the world's weak eye, Let me glide through the crowd, unnoticed, by, Like my least fellow-men—for to God's sight Not cloud-high columns point out worth aright, But the still finger of Humanity! ON RE-VISITING THE OLD CRAG AT THE “VALLEY OF ROCKS,” LINTON. Cast off those clouds from thy hoar brow, old Rock, And let me gaze upon thy face again— There sit'st thou still, and look'st, with calm disdain, On Ocean: spurning, with fixed foot, the shock Of his encroaching waves; though, block by block, Beneath he saps thee, thundering might and main, While, pillar-like, thy brows above sustain The thunder cloud, thou both alike dost mock! Thou art unaltered since I saw thee last— Thou hast no struggles of the feverish will: Grief wears thee not, nor phantoms of the past; The task God set thee thou performest still; Thou hast not gone astray, hast done no ill, But, like th' eternal sea, art as thou wast! THE HARMONIES OF LIFE. O music of old thoughts, still unforgot: Familiar stops of Life's first harmony! The pipe hath, long-unfingered, been laid by, And tears, like crusted salt, its surface blot— But Time hath deeper melodies begot Upon it: he hath played it stealthily Meanwhile, and made its tones more full and high, With hopes and fears of this our common lot! He has called forth new notes, and made the old More mellow—he has touched it oft since then, To all Life's themes so rich and manifold, And tuned it to the living hearts of men! So now I take it up, with hand more bold And firm, and play Life's music o'er agen. THE FUTURE. Down climbing Thought, that at thy prison-bars Gasp'st for a little breath of heavenly air: For one brief glimpse of those abodes so fair, Which thou hast pictured 'bove yon' clear, calm stars, That, in the deep, blue vault, like cavern-spars, Gleam with divine intelligence, as 'twere, Heav'n's conscious eyes—as if they had a care Of human things: the tutelary Lars Of those diviner homes! but 'tis not so— They are but cressets in the hall of night: The moving lamps, that ever come and go, Strewing their golden fires in the sight Of Mortals, wondering why the hall should show So empty, lit with such a pomp of light! THE LABOURER'S HOLIDAY. The poor Man's Sabbath-happiness how great! 'Twould gild the surface of a rich Man's week, Hackneyed and worn, with gold, like that doth streak The heavëns, when the sun gets up in state: Pure gold without alloy! that day heaven's gate Morn opes for him express—for him, though meek And lowly, Earth doth all her joys bespeak, And Pleasure on his steps, that day, doth wait, As on a king's! for him the flower blows, For him the bird doth sing, as forth he goes Into his Father's mansion, like an heir; And well may he be blessed, if this he knows And feels: and know he must, if that day's prayer, “Our Father, which art in heav'n,” in mind he bear! WRITTEN AT LINMOUTH; NORTH DEVON. Whence cam'st thou, lovely spot, that liëst here In Desolation's lap, so fresh and green? She is a rude nurse, but to thee hath been Full-tender: with her hills thy little sphere Of beauty, arm-like, circling—she doth rear Her rocky forehead from the deep to screen Thy loveliness, and, in her wildest mien, Awes back the rude sea with a look severe! Whence cam'st thou? didst thou rise from out the Deep, Like some Hesperian land, long sought in vain? Of which the seaman gets a passing peep, As, on a summer's eve, his bark doth creep Along the quiet shore: where thou hast lain, Like some uncar'd-for gem thrown by the main! REAL LIFE. Live in the present—thou art, in the past, A shadow 'mongst old Charon's freight of shades: An unsubstantial being, which evades The ties of flesh and blood: a shadow cast By Fancy's magic-lantern! so thou hast No life but now; the rest is: masquerades, Shadows and shows of things, the fitful aids Of Fancy, gilded clouds, and gone as fast! Thou would'st not in the Future live, e'en though Thou should'st be born again: thou would'st be there A mere anachronism, and would'st stare At things the veriest little child would know; Man's happiness is, with the mass to go, And not with those “who are to be” or “were!” ON A CRAG, WITH A VAST NICHE-LIKE CAVITY IN ITS FACE. There is a niche in yon' old rock, which seems By Nature left for some great statue; yet How few are worthy therein to be set, Of all with which each mortal temple teems! Man rears up statues to himself, and dreams That he is great: with pompous epithet Inscribing them, as Nature were in debt To him, for lending her his petty themes! But she is of another mind, and in Her temple—this fair World—admits but few, But very few—the Meek, the Good, the True, Who labour for their fellow-men to win Th' eternal truths of God: regardless who May reap the godlike work which they begin! ON A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET. It is a lovely ev'ning!—over day's Blue eye the night is closing noiselessly, Like a soft eyelid—'tis as if the eye Of God himself, delighted, ceased to gaze Upon the wonders his great work displays; As if He saw that all was good, and, by The stars, each as his silent deputy, Watched o'er the earth, which through them he surveys! A few, faint clouds still linger on their way: They have fulfilled their mission, and, awhile, Loiter on night's dim verge, as 'twere, in play! O Man, and canst thou too not reconcile Thy duties with thy pleasures, and, like day, Thus on thy closing labours, godlike, smile! FREE-MASONS. Free-mason are you? aye, and I as well! Free, by a higher and an older rite Of ordination far than ye, who write Yourselves free-masons, and who dare not tell Your secret, lest you break thus the poor spell; Free of this world so fair and infinite, Labouring in all men's view, and in the light Of God, wherein no idle secrets dwell! There are no secrets in the masonry Which good men use: no signs, save those which Love Employs, its presence lovingly to prove— Day-labourers are they, who beautify The temple of God's truth, and from above Derive the sanction of their ministry! ON A FAVOURITE DOG. He's worth his weight in gold, you say! ay, more— He has a heart full capable of love, And that, methinks, is far all wealth above, For that thou could'st not buy with all thy store! Spread out thy glittering treasures all before His eyes, yet he no joy thereat will prove, Not even wag his tail! yet may'st thou move His very heart, with one kind word, to pour The treasures of its love out at thy feet! How more divine must love then be than gold, Since e'en a brute thy love with love doth meet, Divinely answering! learn then to hold Mere wealth of small account, since 't will not cheat E'en that poor hound, whose love cannot be bought or sold! AGAINST PRIDE OF INTELLECT. Proud Poet, think'st thou that the mass of men, Low as they seem beneath thy fancied height, Have yet no other sources of delight, No poesy, save that of thy poor pen! Little as distance makes them to thy ken, Haply that self same distance, to their sight, Makes thee as little seem, and with more right, Who deem'st thyself not of them, and art then, And just for this, beneath them! is yon' sun, Rising in glory, not far better, pray, Than thy description of it? the lark's lay Itself than all thy verses on it? one Sweet flow'r more than all that thou canst say, And far beyond thy best comparison? Oh Nature hath not left her children all So unprovided for—she hath not made One heart for which some music hath not played, Which thou hast never heard! for things, which small To thee appear, may be poetical And grand to others, who, not for parade, But for their daily lives, with little aid Of rhyme, a poesy more literal, Yet grander far, create! nor yet on thee Has she heaped all her gifts, and left the rest To wonder at her partiality— Thou from thy fellow-men deriv'st the best And most of what thou hast, although it be, As 'twere, a sum put out at interest! ON THE FALLS OF NIAGARA. Sweep on, thou mighty stream magestical, Monarch of waters, broad, and still, and deep, That, in the consciousness of strength, dost keep As yet proud silence, and take from thy fall Sublime voice mighty and poetical, To tell the world, as headlong o'er the steep, With foaming thunders, thou dost bound and leap, That mightiest things are calmest still of all! Then sink to sublime silence as before— As if it cost thee nought to speak as though Thou could'st outvoice the mighty Ocean's roar, Whene'er occasion called on thee to show The power which thy silence in it bore, Not lightly roused, but mightiest when so! AN ANSWER. A foolish dreamer! well, e'en be it so— And yet I am awake, or, waking, dream Things truer, or which so unto me seem, Than those who wake o' nights and no rest know, Till they get rich, and life for money throw Away: and Love, its crowning-grace supreme, And God (Love's essence,) openly blaspheme, Mocking him, in his temple, with vain show! Perhaps I dream—I dream the world is fair, Fairer than heart can know or tongue can say! That Love doth greater treasures with it bear Than wealth—and that no wealth were thrown away, Could it a sense procure ye, though it were But of a flower's beauty, for one day! TO MILTON. Oh noble spirit, like a mountain-peak, Lifting thy calm head up above the clouds: While all these lower regions darkness shrouds, Thou in the sunshine of God's truth dost seek Thy light! yet, at that elevation, meek And lowly, as though thou hadst no such view, Looking before and after, but wert too A daily labourer, resting once a week! In the far vista of the past, sublime, To my memorial fancy thou dost seem Above all neighbouring heights of fame to climb (Upbearing, pillar-like, the heavens) supreme! The while thy glory, like the sunset's gleam, Casts thy long shadow beyond space and time! TO ARTISTS WHO LOOK WITH JEALOUS EYES ON ARTISTICAL PROCESSES, SUCH AS CHROMALITHOGRAPHY, ETC. ETC. The mind of Man can never supersede Itself by its inventions: though it make “Machines to calculate,” and from it take The mere mechanic processes, which need But little, save attention, to succeed— And this, in Nature's course, for its sole sake Was so ordained: that thus all bonds 't might break, And freer move, as 't were with wings indeed! Fear not—the great, creative mind of Man Takes a far wider scope than sense can span; And all these rare inventions have but worth As means and instruments, whereby he can Mould more completely to his will this earth, And give his own divine conceptions birth! ON A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET, WITH NEWLY-GATHERED CLOUDS. Why do ye kindle up, ye Heavëns, now, Those gratulatory fires in the sky? Is it because this sweet day hath gone by Without a passing shade upon its brow, That ye those clouds, which have, I know not how, Gathered meanwhile, themselves scarce knowing why, Light up with gold and crimson tracery, To make them thus your triumph more avow? The festival ye keep is innocent, And your rejoicings holy in God's sight— For they are not for the accomplishment Of Man's blind ends, the triumph over Right Of Wrong, but for the celebration meant Of truths enduring as the firmament! TO THE SEA, AFTER A GREAT STORM. JANUARY 15TH. Thou hast been drunk, thou Sea, but not with wine: With power, and with consciousness of might Invincible! and, as it were a slight And broken slumber, like a libertine, Thou hast arisen, in thy strength divine, And cast thy rest from off thee, making light Of Man and his vain works, with infinite Contempt, as sharing not with thee or thine! But now thy Saturnalia again Are done, and thou liest listless on the shore, A melancholy stillness brooding o'er Thy majesty, a sense almost of pain, And, 't might seem, of remorse, for power in vain Exerted, to destroy, not to restore! HOPES FROM THE SPREAD OF PHRENOLOGY. Phrenology! lay thy broad hand upon The forehead of the coming Time, and say What now is working at the brain—which way The mighty thoughts, that will transform anon The face of earth, are tending—mark'st thou, on That so capacious brow, no new display, No fresh developments, no signs, which may, To thy prophetic eye, make clearly known What shape the coming age will take? there is An hum of mighty changes! Hope takes cheer: And Expectation stands on tip-toe; 'tis A time of promise: prophecies we hear Of Man reclaimed by Nature to her sphere, And mutual knowledge causing mutual bliss! POETRY OF LIFE. He is the greatest Artist who is so In his own daily life: who draws, in truth, His Art's materials from thence—whose youth, Manhood, and age, in one grand series flow, Living designs and groupings, such as no Mere artist ever framed, nor e'en the hand Of Michael Angelo himself e'er plann'd! He is the greatest poet, who can go Forth in his singing-robes, not on high-days Alone, but as his every-day attire; Who, though he, like the lark, each dawn aspire Unto the heaven of song, like him, no-ways Disdains the earth, though borne on wings of fire, Nor the least duty which she on him lays! COMPOSED IN THE WHISPERING-GALLERY AT ST. PAUL'S. Here stand I, and receive into my ear The threadlike lines of sound: not brokenly, Nor yet confused, but gathered, as they fly, To their true focus, in one utterance clear; For here, from all points of the hemisphere, The Gallery is the inside of an hemisphere. The lines converge, coinstantaneously; And, though so many, yet all these do I But as one, single sound harmonious hear. So in this vast world to Faith's ear, if true, There is a point, where all its whispers too Converge—where all that speaks in earth and skies Is gathered in one mighty Word, which through All Nature thrills, to which each heart replies, The burthen of her endless harmonies! ON DOING NO INJURY. Wrong thou no living being, though but by The least ill thought; for, though sure that it ne'er Can be discovered, yet there is, I fear, Still one to whom it must, unfailingly, Be known: thyself! and thus the injury Is done to thee! and this will become clear, Wilt thou but think what Man should hold most dear, His soul, and all else for it! now, if thy Own self-respect be lessened, by a thought Or act of thine, hast thou not thereby done Thyself a lasting injury, which nought Can make good to thee? thou hast in thine own Eyes lessened thyself: the worst ill! and one Which none, but thou thyself, could e'er have wrought! ON SELF-DENIAL. Deny thyself, and what thou dost deny Thyself will be a godlike gain—will be As measurelessly more, both in degree And kind, than all thy wish could e'er supply, If granted, as the Godlike is (which thy Heart through it feels) more than all else to thee: For, if felt, all else but as naught thou'lt see, Compared therewith; make thou ungrudgingly The will of others, and their pleasure, thine; Thus wilt thou have the enjoyment, not of one, But many hearts, yet all still as thine own! In doing good, give thou thereof no sign: Be viewless, as the wind: pass on unknown, Merged, like thy Maker, in thy work divine! SIMPLICITY. Think thou no evil, and none shall there be, For thee, in this wide world; be as a child, So innocent, that thou may'st pluck the wild Field-flowers, and in them far, far more see To value, than in all the baubles we, We grown-up fools, by the world's gauds beguiled, Still set our hearts on; keep thine undefiled, And in the holy well of Memory Mix thou no bitterness: for thou, in thy Old age, thereof, when Hope's bright cup is dry, Must drink right oft; be still a child at heart: And, though cold Reason turn to mockery Love's young dreams, yet the best need not depart, Itself, which thou, when most awake, most hast and art! ON STARTING FROM LONDON AT SIX IN THE MORNING. Now with the growing light the lamps contend, The Heavenly mastering the Earthly: Day, Like a plain labourer, in hodden gray, Comes forth to overlook, and to right end Direct, the World's vast labours; he doth send All others to their toil, and well he may, Who is the greatest—on his sublime way, In sober majesty, he now doth wend, His godlike eye fixed on his daily task! O Man, then be thou like him—though so great, That all the stars, which gild the morning, wait Upon, and give place to, him: he doth ask No service of these handmaids, but both late And early toils, too great for idle state! UPON TITIAN. When Titian brought his pictures to a close, “Faciebat” merely he beneath them wrote, Thereby their incompleteness to denote; No wonder that he to Art's summit rose, And, from the topmost round, looked down on those Who started with him for that goal remote! An hundred years thereto did he devote, As others days, and, sinking to repose, Like some tall column towering 'gainst the sky, Threw his vast shadow o'er a century! And, at his setting, he was like the sun, (His fame being equalled by his modesty) As if he thought not of what he had done, Nor of the darkness which on earth would lie! TO ENGLAND, ON HER TREATMENT OF GENOA. My country! hadst thou done thy duty, how, How Godlike wouldst thou be rewarded by That love which ever waits on actions high! Hadst thou held, with thy mighty hand, the plough Of Civilization but as firm as thou Hast grasped the sword, what harvests now would lie Ripe for the sickle of Humanity! But thou wilt learn too late, nay! even now Time brings the lesson home, that love can bind Surer than force, and that to conquer Mind Is measurelessly more than War can do! Thou might'st have given light unto the blind, And left the barren waste behind thee too A smiling Eden, gladdening mankind! Thou should'st have been transfigured by the light Divine thou held'st, in sight of those it blest, Like him who saved mankind—from thy proud crest Thou should'st have cast reflections infinite (Like Morning from some earth-o'er-gazing height,) Of civilization, on thy sacred quest Still speeding: till thou had'st, from east to west, Stretched out thine arm, like God's, a pillar of might! Then had thy voice been mightier than thy hand Is now, thy whisper than an army's shout— Like the great sea, o'er which thou hast command, Thou should'st have cast a zone of peace about The world, and bound its members in one grand, Indissoluble bond of Love throughout! Unright can never prosper! Good alone Endures: through envy, error, prejudice, It passes on, like the Divinity's Life-giving breath, and that on which 't has blown, If false, must wither, and if true, make known Its blessing and its presence to men's eyes And hearts, as at the breath of Spring arise The flowers! 'tis a seed that's never sown In vain; for though not reaped at once, 't may be, 'Tis paid tenfold: with love of all mankind, Not merely of the one served or set free! For there is still an eye among the blind, An ear among the deaf, to hear and see, A voice among the dumb, that none can bind! There is an universal conscience—by Unnumbered single consciences is this Made up, and, as their highest utterance, is God's voice! oh England! do not then rely On the vain hope, that men, from envy, try To blacken thee; there is no plotting, 'tis No mean conspiracy, to rob of his Just laurels the deserving head—on high This voice is heard and marked—men are not so Unjust: though individuals often do From envy judge, this sublime voice knows no Regards: the Godlike only and the True, Which each heart feels, it utters, and thus, through Mankind's own voice, God speaks His will below! ST. ANTONY'S DAY. St. Antony is the patron of animals in Italy, and, on the day sacred to him, horses &amp;c. &amp;c. are sprinkled with holy water and blessed by the priest. 'Tis worthy of Religion to embrace The cause of mercy, though the object may Be but a worm! would that this sainted day, Time immemorial for act of grace And goodness set apart, had found a place In our own calendar; we too might pray St. Antony, methinks, yet go astray But little, nor our worship much misplace! God would forgive us the idolatry, Thus made subservient to humanity; Yea! the great Father would not take amiss, That e'en a dumb ass should be sprinkled by The priest, like Man himself, or blessed in His High name, who has himself blessed all that is! Nor would there any desecration be Of holy things: since e'en the holiest Are holier made, when used thus for the best Of purposes—for Love itself! which He Sets so above all else, that He would see, With joy, men so far his religion wrest, As to an image vain to bend the knee, If for Love's sake and Mercy's interest; For then the homage still were His alone! Methinks too, that religion might supply Something to imitate, which thus makes known The claims of brutes, and, eager to atone By inward truth for outward heresy, Brings them once more within man's sympathy! ON MILTON. I love to read the bard of Paradise By the great sea: the waves' majestic swell Marking the time, and answering so well The pauses of the verse, that, in their rise And fall continuous, its harmonies Seem echoed back; as though, voicefull, and clear, They were repeating them in Nature's ear, Things with which heaven and earth might sympathise. With such accompaniment I could think That Nature, moved by that great argument, To the still music of Man's thoughts had lent Utterance, and set thereto the waves, that sink And rise, like epic verse magnificent, Creation's music! in acknowledgment. A CALM, SEASIDE SUNSET. The Mightiest too is gentlest—the great Sea Lies like a thing with which a child might play, As a tame Lion, on whose back men lay Their hands familiárly, as though he Were never otherwise—Earth seems to be, After day's labour, resting on her way, Through the blue ether—on the closing day Silence attends, as by the deathbed we May watch of one we love—a ball of red And fiery splendor yonder sets the sun, Steeping all things in beauty: Heaven's vast hall Is cloudless: sky and ocean round are spread, In one unbroken Blank, leaving but one Pervading sense of vastness over all! TRUE GREATNESS. True Greatness hath no strivings for effect: It rises like the mountains to the sky, Lifting its head in simple majesty; A firm, deep base with Nature doth connect It ever, solid breadth of intellect; And, as the peaks of highest In most of the highest European mountains, granite, the primary and most enduring formation of rock, constitutes their peaks as well as their bases. mountains by The same hard granite, which doth fortify Their depths, are formed, so the true architect Of greatness builds his fortunes of a piece Throughout, and still, at each extreme, the same Is found—and therefore takes he such long lease Of glory; like the mountains shall his name Endure, and still from age to age increase, Gathering the long arrears of well-earned fame! TO THE SEA. Thou ne'er-unloosed and all-embracing zone, That gird'st the virgin-waist of Earth: not e'en The famed and fabled belt of Beauty's queen Possessed one half the charms which thou dost own, Thou glorious girdle! by the Almighty thrown Round the work of his hands, as if to screen It from defilement! loveliness hath been Thine attribute, and, as upon a throne, Doth majesty dwell in thee, from the first! Still, fresh as morning, thou flow'st on around The world, naught yet thy guarding cirque hath burst Asunder—not the Earthquake, with his sound Of thunder, nor the Tempest—nothing durst Lay hands on, or approach, thee, without awe profound! THE LARK. What quit-rent should the lark to Nature pay Save his own song? She is content with less Than thanks—with his, which is her, happiness; Yet most melodious thanks he pays each day, And, while dull Earth still slumbers, far away The ear of Morning with a strain doth bless, That Sadness of herself would dispossess, And make her almost with her sorrows play! Of all her choristers he pays her best: Dissembling never, with a mocking tongue, The overflowing joy that swells his breast; The whiles the Nightingale doth her some wrong, By notes that seem sad: yet he does but jest At grief, to make his joy more keen and long! THE WISH. Oh that I had a giant's stride, to make My stepping-stones the mountains—in his pride, Forth with the sun to go, 'till even-tide: To see him on a thousand hills awake The songs of Morn, and of Earth, blushing, take His leave with smiles, as bridegroom of his bride; See Night's star-glittering zone the world divide, And young-eyed Morning o'er the one half break, More rosy than a new-waked cherub! then The music of a thousand streams I'd list, The thunder on a hundred hills; and, when The storm raged, I would, as a denizen 'Mid equals, lay my hand on, and untwist, His fiery locks, and play with them as with my pen! PRIDE. Pride is the stubbornest sin with which Man has To struggle—it assumes so many shapes, And, at the moment when 'tis caught, escapes, Disguised like virtue! if you hold the glass Of truth to it, and show it therein as It is, it seems to stand rebuked, and apes Humility: and thus thy virtue saps The surer—thou hast put on the cuirass Of spiritual warfare 'gainst a foe, Who, in thy very triumph, doth o'erthrow His victor, and in secret doth deride: For thou art proud of having conquered Pride; And, when thou seem'st most humble, he will glide Into thy heart, proud still of being so! ON A RICH AUTUMN-SUNSET. Lo! on yon intervening hill the wood, Which intercepts the setting sun, burns bright, With unconsuming foliage, in his light; Each leaf is turned to fire by the flood Of radiance, and hues the rainbow could Not rival mix and change each moment—sight Suffices not to trace their exquisite Comminglings—soul and sense are both subdued Alike thereby—a solemn stillness holds The air, as Nature paused upon the scene: Heaven in its embrace the Earth enfolds; And, in yon' wood, which hides him as a screen Of living fire, mine eye the sun beholds, Like God transfiguring, himself unseen! ON THE CLIFFS NEAR LINMOUTH, NORTH DEVON. Here Earth and Ocean meet direct, without Parley or compromise, and full, in bold Defiance, 'gainst the rocks the waves are rolled, Urging each other on with answering shout, Af if th' eternal barriers they would flout; But with her rocky feet, of giant mould, Earth stands her ground, spurning her manifold Opponents from her, hurtling in their rout! She veils her lofty head in clouds, and thence Looks down afar, with calm indifference, On the mad waves that 'neath her boil and hiss; Gazing, prophetic, o'er the void immense (Which but the agent of her greatness is) On visions of her own magnificence! WRITTEN ON THE SEA-SHORE. By the roused Ocean I do love to stand, And, to the billows' loud dash, as they break Beneath, and with their foamy thunders shake Earth's basis, set my verse, in pauses scann'd Not by the pedant's finger, but the grand Self-cadenced measure of the waves, which make By their own motion melody, and take Poetic licence beyond Man's command. And, as the billow, with unconscious might, Dashes the seaweed in its scornful play, Would that my weak verse, surging to the height Of its great purpose, so might sweep away Earth's bubbles and worn prejudices, light As weeds, before the great truths it would say! ON THE DEPARTING YEAR: CHRISTMAS. Now, like a beggar, the decrepid year Crawls on in tatters, which the rude wind turns Up at each step—once more the eye discerns That face turned briefly back, which Man shall ne'er Behold again, as, gathering his sear And faded garments round him, patched with ferns And leaves, with such rude art as Misery learns From dire constraint, he totters to his bier! What would he not give now for the mere waste, Superfluous finery of Summer, for A few green leaves to screen him from the war Of elements, whose rage hath so defaced His goodly form! Oh thou, his heir at law, Take of thine heritage a wise foretaste! ON A SOVEREIGN. Lie there, thou worthless gold! and yet not vile, Save only unto those who make thee so, And, thee abusing, their own vileness show; Thou hast lit many a pale cheek with a smile Of hope, and cheered the drooping heart meanwhile: Giv'n strength unto the hammer's fainting blow, And caused the song oft, at the loom, to flow From hearts which it had long ceased to beguile! The father's sweat has earned thee: thou hast fed His children, while he himself would not taste! The wife has pay'd thee, with averted head, And tear, which hallowed thee as it was shed, Her last, last coin, for him whose cruel waste Her heart in all, save love, had bankrupted! Lie there, thou holy gold, for such thou art; Bright characters are graved on thee—not those Stamped by the mint, but letters of the heart! An higher image too thine impress shows Than that of kings, which 'mid them burns and glows, With light that Heaven only could impart; Thou art no more the vile coin of the mart, But one which e'en Heav'n's gates might well unclose! It has conveyed the Godlike, as the rod Of iron does the lightning from the sky; The impress on it is the face of God, Which from it gleams and on thee bends its eye! Then spend it as if in a temple trod Thy feet, and He, to watch thine act, stood by! ON A SUNSET LANDSCAPE, SEEN OVER WATER. I looked—the sun was setting rosy-red: I gazed, with more and more intense delight, As, like a halo of ethereal light, His rays were gathered round the sinking head Of dying Day—along the stream were spread The last, faint smiles of Nature, calmly bright, As if on her so holy works her sight For the last time were bent, ere Night should wed Them to Oblivion! beyond the stream There lay a happy land, like Paradise: As fair and still as, but too like, a dream! Alas! beyond the stream it ever lies, That happy land, and in the far-off gleam Of spectral suns, unknown to mortal eyes! But yet the spirit can that prize attain: That can pass over, distant though it seem! And, through the eyes, endowed with power supreme O'er outward circumstance, it doth obtain Free egress, and comes back at will again. Through those Elysian fields, beyond the stream, Flowing like fabled river in a dream, It wanders, and at will doth there remain! Reader, hast understood? then go, likewise, And let thy soul, believingly, make true My words, and so that fair land realize! For, if that dwell there, thou dwell'st in it too, And calmly thence Life's turmoil here may'st view; That stream is Time's, that land Eternity's! AGAINST OVERSEVERE RELIGION, ALIAS NONE. The world is not a hermit's cell—e'en by The bare rock, where th' Ascetic seeks repose, From what he call's life's conflicts and vain throes, By vanity supplanting vanity, The flower cheers his sense and charms his eye; Seeming, with silent comment, to expose His joyless creed, and teach him, as it grows In loveliness, the mild theology Of Nature! were this Earth a wilderness, Then haply we in such a creed might trace A fitness; but its wealth and loveliness Are such, that she doth Solitude displace With songs of joyance, and with flowers dress The waste, that Man may smile, and love her face! ON SEEING A POOR PERSON, TO WHOM I HAD GIVEN CLOTHING. I met the old man, now so warmly clad 'Gainst winter, and, rejoicing, asked him how He felt—he answered “better,” while his brow Kindled with gratitude, as though he had Received the benefit, not I! what bad, What sorry reckoners the rich must be, In Joy's arithmetic, who unmov'd see The face, which they with smiles might make so glad, In sorrow steeped! then to myself I said, The clothing warms not him, but me—and yet Not outwardly, it warms my heart instead! Yet he, as though his only were the debt, Thanks me still! see! how gently is Man led To Good, thus more than all he gave to get! CONTENTMENT. Not to enjoy things, and not to possess, Are much the same—nay, haply, in the end, The last to our real happiness will tend Far more—it makes us use more, lay more stress On those we have; which, tho' in themselves less, Thus more enjoyment yield, since we depend On self more—and this one doth comprehend, In its sole self, enjoyments numberless! Enjoyment is the sole possession which Deserves the name—the Earth, with all her charms, Belongs not to the mighty or the rich, But unto him whose heart a flower warms To prayer—whose eye a daisy can bewitch— He clasps her, like a bride, within his arms! UPON RAILWAY TRAVELLING. One would think this were the high road to heaven, So like to milestones the church-steeples show, Pointing, with silent finger, as we go, To their far goal; as tho' they would have given Vain Man a warning, had he not been driven Too swiftly by to heed it, or to throw Even a passing glance upon Time's slow, Sure finger—Time, from whose dominion even He feels half freed, while thus, with borrowed wings Of mechanism, Time seems left behind! These moments saved, the soul's alms, Science brings To o'erworked Man, to the true halt and blind; Abridgments of the sense to énlarge mind, To give it time to pause, and ask the end of things! ON A LOVELY GIRL OF HUMBLE BIRTH. Seest thou yon maid, so plain in her attire, Yet beautiful, in its simplicity, As the wild lily? in her downcast eye Sits Modesty enthroned to check desire: Her lips the very breath of love respire, Like the first rose of May, scarce touched yet by The passing wind: while untaught dignity Turns admiration into something higher! She is a queen of nature, and around Her steps a silent reverence is shed, The Air doth lay its charmed ear to the ground, To listen to the music of her tread: Earth holds her breath, as with a pause profound, And the touched Elements are captive led! Her smile is as the coming-on of spring: Her soft, blue eye is like the evening-star, Which all that's sweetest in Love's calendar Takes date from! with its first glance every thing That's holiest and dearest doth it bring To mind—the thoughts of woman's love, of home, Domestic peace, and children's smiles, all come Upon us, with their gentlest visiting. No dower has she but her loveliness, Yet power and boundless wealth might sue in vain: She has already felt their emptiness! A heart to love is all she seeks to gain: The highest can't give more, nor yet of less Has Nature left her meanest to complain! WRITTEN AT SUNSET, AFTER RAIN. Now on the forehead of the dying Day Hath God his rainbow set, in sign of peace, Ethereal pledge, that, after brief surcease, He shall arise with purer, brighter ray! Lo! Twilight momently extends his sway, Shadowy, save where, behind yon antique trees, Transparent 'mid the golden light, the breeze Wafts the empurpled clouds upon their way; Which, as they slowly fade and pale, the Thought Moulds into living imagery for this Grand hymn, awhile now closing, 'till it is Commenced again, ere Morning's star hath sought The West, with songs of love, in praise of His High name, whose spirit thro' the hymn hath wrought! WRITTEN AFTER BUYING SOME FLOWERS IN LONDON. Oh Nature, how, how richly do'st thou pay Us back again for all our love can do To thee or thine! the feeling of the True, The Beautiful, and not for one brief day, (For what we take to heart we keep for aye) Thou giv'st me for this fleeting dross of earth: Things beyond all, for what is of no, worth! How many gifts before me do'st thou lay With this one flower! Amalthæa's horn, With all its sweets, thou emptiest at my feet! List! 'tis the lark, that, as it were, in scorn Of darkling earth, sings to the star of morn, While, like the drops that cool ripe Summer's heat, 'Mid the green leaves, his notes fall fresh and sweet! All, all are there! the sweet-breath'd violet, Which, near the ground, grows lowly, and which we Mast stoop to pluck, like Life's best sweets, that be Oftener beneath, than up above, us set! Primrose and bell, in rival beauty met, With every bud that keeps them company. Oh charmëd flower! that, like a master-key, Canst open all the wards of Memory, And thro' their doors, as Fancy beckons, let Us forth into the green fields and fresh air! How little perfect love requires! how small A thing suffices to the heart to call, In living beauty, all that once did share Its love, however long the interval! Oh Nature, thou hast many a secret door Unto the heart! the blessing, which at birth, Thou gav'st us, fails not, but gains still new worth, Still yielding, as we more deserve it, more; Thou best Godmother! not like those of earth, For thou fulfill'st thy compact, watchëst o'er Thy child, and on his chosen head do'st shower Thy wondrous gifts, with love that knows no dearth; And of them these, the best—Wisdom with Mirth, And Love, still as the highest form of power! Thus to my heart this one, one little flower, Can bring back all thy blessedness and peace: For in it that first blessing doth not cease To work: the love of thee, thy best birth-dower! THE LILY OF PALESTINE. Proud lily, thou hast sown not, neither spun The garments of thy loveliness, and yet Thine airy brows instinctively beget Respect in all the flowers; there is none But to thy beauty bends its head, as one On whose high forehead Nature's hand has set A kingly imprint, like an amulet, That unto thee no treason should be done— The proud earth bears thee as a goodly thing: She lavishes upon thee every gift Of beauty, and around thy form doth fling, As if forgetful of her usual thrift, More majesty than waits upon a King, Above thy painted compeers thee to lift! HUMAN FEELING. Here have I sojourned only a few days, And yet how much already have I found To love, to hope, and do! the very ground Man treads on of his ways a feeling has! The music of a good man's steps earth lays Her ear to listen to, and at the sound Is glad—all things rejoice in, and around, His presence, there is music in his ways! This poor, old man, who on the road breaks stones, Gives me good day each morning—these small loans Of kindness I delight to pay back, aye, With interest—'tis well to have each day Such debts—and who has most, who soonest owns, E'en by the debt doth best the debt repay! ON HEARING SOME ONE SPEAK WITH INDIFFERENCE OF A POOR CHILD. “'Tis but a common child!”—thou'rt wrong, my friend! 'Tis an uncared-for outcast—but of Man, Not Nature: she casts none off thus—and can You to a prejudice so foolish lend An added weight, and help thus to suspend It like a yoke about his neck? a ban: A stern necessity: which first began In words, but in a pow'r like Fate doth end! There is naught common—Nature hath made naught So common, but 't may easily be wrought Up unto some undreamt-of aptitude, With but a little love, a little thought! Yea! into something, too, uncommon good And beautiful! God's own similitude! ON A VERY OLD, BUT STILL FLOURISHING, OAK. Would I might bear my old age even so— So greenly, like thee, thou time-honoured oak! Thou, who hast borne so long the lightning's stroke, And rude winds, powerless to lay thee low; Standing, a Sylvan Terminus, to show The bounds of Time, while 'mid thy branches croak The centenarian ravens, and convoke Their meetings, as their sires long ago! The greenness of thy strength is in thee yet— And the young leaves, so fresh and delicate, That clothe thy rugged stem, suggest a date Far short of that which time has on thee set. So, on unyielding firmness still should wait The gentler attributes which love beget! ON A FROSTY SUNSET. Ye gorgeous clouds, which on the setting sun Attend, how gloriously usefulness And beauty, in your tints, combine, to dress The heav'ns with robes so wonderfully spun, That questioning Science, when she has undone The dazzling tissue, finds it to possess More charms, to her inquiring thoughtfulness, Than all it had from dreaming Fancy won! Those golden hues, to orange deepening, Then into crimson melting slow away, With no unmeaning pageant deck the day— Their beauties from sublimest uses spring! On a frosty sunset, the condensed vapors obstruct first of all the blue rays, allowing the yellow and red to pass, which produce a rich golden hue, deepening into orange; and, at last, when the quantity of condensed vapour is so great as to obstruct the yellow rays also, just when the sun is about to sink, then are produced those gorgeous red and crimson tints, which the eye of science and of uninstructed nature alike delight to dwell on, though the former derives a far higher gratification from the spectacle; in which it beholds one among the countless instances of the union of the Beautiful and Useful, in which the works of the Almighty abound. The red rays are the warmest as well as the strongest, and, when the vapors are condensed in frosty weather, at sunrise and sunset, are the first to reach the earth, and the last to forsake it: a beautiful and benevolent arrangement of Providence to temper the cold of winter. So Science wider scope gives to the wing Of Poesy, and still extends her sway! ON SEEING A FRIEND AFTER FIVE YEARS' ABSENCE. Dear Friend! a wonder palpable as aught On record, hast thou wrought unconsciously; Thou hast mixed up no draught, like that whereby Medea gave back youth: yet, at the thought And sight of thee, like miracle is wrought! From the long score, which, so insensibly, We run up in Time's debt, five years by thy Mere presence are struck off, as they were naught But fleeting figures summed up on a slate! 'Tis well worth while to lose a few years, so To be repaid! I little heed the state Of time, what year the almanack may show; For I feel five years younger: and, you know, Youth at the heart is youth without a date! Old days are with me, and the joyous chime Of youth comes, with thy voice, back on mine ear: And things to memory now, to hope then dear, With life's first dew upon them in their prime; Our twin-ambitions, eager-winged to climb The heights of Acadëmic honours, ere The world, and all its larger-hearted sphere, Had opened on us, Life, and Love, and Rhyme! Years have passed by since then, and where are we At shaking hands again, to manhood grown? Old Time to sober mirth has tamed our glee, And by the way our wild oats all are sown: Yet the old heart of our Humanitie Is left, all other losses to atone! ON AN ANCIENT CASTLE IN RUINS, SAVE ONE PORTION, WHICH FORMS A KIND OF DWELLING. Nature hath been at work on these old walls— The turf has grown, in green mounds, up their sides— And the thick ivy (as seaweed the tides Of ages) here the rises and the falls Of Time's great ocean, the successive calls Of Nature, registers: as each year hides, With its fresh growth, some emblem that divides Man's ways from hers, and throws its leafy palls Stilly o'er their forgotten destinies! So let them pass: while the soft summer-winds Sigh out their dirge—for nothing good e'er dies! Nature, who with her flowers yon' loopholes blinds, Still fosters more enduring sympathies, And gently from old errors Man's heartstrings unwinds! ON THE HAPPY PROSPECT OF PEACE WITH AMERICA. Lo! the dark clouds, which threatened angry war, Once more are scattered, and the bow of peace, Spanning the heavens, promises increase And joy to Earth: Peace, the true household Lar Of Man, and Heaven's steward! o'er the far Atlantic, like a glorious frontispiece, On the fair face of heav'n, to this new lease Of civilization, lo! it spans the air! A bridge for Peace to cross the ocean wide, One end on England's seabuilt buttress rests, The other on America's strong side; While all between Peace with her wings invests, Sheltering the fleets that far beneath her glide, And speeding them upon their sacred quests! ON SOME FLOWERS IN A POOR PERSON'S WINDOW IN LONDON. Flowers, that in the city's dim haunts grow, Enriching them with sweetness little known, And giving joy, at the price of your own Existence, like the poet—as men go Past ye, how many yearn, and upward throw Their eyes, recalled to feelings they've outgrown, The while their heart-strings, touched to some old tone Of Nature's primal music, thrill and glow! Ye are the poor man's unbought poesy— Ye to the city's jaded denizen, The freshness of green fields bring healingly; And, in this peopled solitude, where men Without a greeting pass each other by, Have power to stir beyond the poet's pen! ON A SHIPWRECK, OFF BEACHY-HEAD, BY COPLEY FIELDING. Darkness behind, as of th' o'ershadowing wings Of blank Despair, and dim, pale light before, Like Hope expiring on the wreckstrewn shore! Like a wild Bacchanal, roused Ocean flings His foamy locks upon the wind, and sings A hymn of triumph, marking, with the roar Of each successive wave, some hope no more, Snatched like the plank, to which the struggler clings! The winds are toying with the mighty waves, Wild playfellows, careless how many graves Their mad mirth makes—while, on their quivering crests, The seagull, Danger's playmate, fearless rests, Mocking the wretch, who mercy vainly craves, With safety's image, while Death all invests! TO KEATS. Thou art the truest poet, Keats, for thou Sing'st but for love, not guerdon: even as The lark in morning's ear, whose music was, And is, and ever will be, still as now, Unconscious of an effort, as the bough Is of its perfume—but the world doth pass Such by: 'tis hard of hearing, and, alas! Harder of heart, and takes no count of how A poet lives and dies, till he be gone; Still, when he asks for bread, it “gives a stone!” And accurate biographers search out His life's least details, when his name has grown A word of power, and a light about It gathered, that attends not a King's throne! UPON SEEING A STAR IMMEDIATELY OVER THE HEAD OF THE STATUE ON THE DUKE OF YORK'S COLUMN, LONDON. See! how yon' bright star, for a moment, crests With light that emblematic statue's head, And, as if heaven did reverence to the dead, With solemn majesty its form invests! Yet that high-rearëd effigy arrests Not lastingly the glory on it shed— On moves the star, upon its divine quests, And darkness falls, funereal, in its stead! Not on such brows the light of Heaven dwells Abidingly—tho' high that column soar, But a vain tale the passing winds it tells, Of claims remembered by mankind no more— While, far above, Fame's steady star dispels The mists from some meek head, forgot before! ON THE SEMPLON. Napoleon, thou'st raised a monument Here of thy pow'r and genius, greater far Than aught the wake of thy triumphal car Could leave behind—great intellect mis-spent, And boundless means but folly's aliment! And, as I view it, the false bays of war Wither from thy proud brow, and yon' calm star (Not that of bloody Mars, which ever went Before thee, evilboding) but the clear, Calm star of peace, from its untroubled sphere, One ray divine has lent that brow instead! Then learn from hence how soon doth disappear False glory: and that this same road I tread, Must be thy only path to Fame, when dead! ON THE THAMES, NEAR HAMPTON-COURT. Here flows the Thames unostentatiously— Unmindful of the glories which await His progress, he doth not accelerate His current, with unseemly haste, nor eye E'en the least stream that owes him fëalty Askance, altho' his bosom will dilate Anon, and he, with kingly pomp and state, Proud cities, kneeling at his feet, pass by! Anon, and airy bridges will his brow, Like mural crowns, encircle, as he goes, On towards the mighty Deep, above the woes Of this brief generation lifting, now As ever, his eternal voice, which knows No change, howe'er Man's fortunes ebb and flow! THE TRUE DIGNITY OF MAN. The highest tribute that a man can have Is, to be loved—and he who is, though by His meanest fellow creature, stands more nigh To God by this alone, than if Kings gave Him titles manifold, his way to pave To life's false greatness—little dignity Can he from titles gain, however high, Who cannot make himself, amongst the brave And good, far higher titles than kings can, Or would, bestow! he who cannot do this, Must want the highest still—the name of “Man”— And he who can, thereby far greater is, Without them, than if dukedoms he could span, For, by accepting those, he that must miss! ON MACHINERY. Ye Poets, who from steam and railroad shrink, And, with poetic maledictions, ban All that falls not at once into your plan, Ye have mista'en your calling, if ye think That Art and Science have not power to sink Fresh shafts into the Muses' mine, nor can Lay open new Castalian founts to Man, Whence greatest Poets will be proud to drink! Nought e'er on earth shall Poesy's high place Usurp, but e'en to Matter her embrace Divine should spiritual offspring bear— Then here, between them, with all heavenly grace, The banns of holy wedlock I declare, Whom God hath joined let none asunder tear! ON RETURNING TO LONDON. I love to visit the great Babylon Each year, but first I let the snowdrop blow: That with the promise of the spring I so May leave, and, with the swallow, come anon, Joying my heart with the comparison! For thus I feel that with Mankind I go, Upon life's solid ground, and well I know That Man lives only by such union— The mighty pulse I like myself to feel: And, by the Metropolitan heart, correct The beatings of my own—not to this sect Or that addicted with onesided zeal, But labóuring the true pulse to detect, Which the great heart's real movements should reveal! ON TWO THORNS IN LEAF, ONE ON EACH SIDE THE PATH. MARCH 27TH. Portals of living green, ye are the gates Of spring—ye lead to all the loveliness Of the new year, and with rich promise bless This path, yet bare—with promise which creates A sense of coming beauty, and foredates Its own fulfilment. Therefore do I press Onward, through ye, to all the happiness Beyond, like some rich heir to his estates! And, lo! another full-sure pledge is here— Though small, yet of great promise—in the root Of yon' old oak, with leaves embrowned and sere, Primrose and violet, at Beauty's suit, Do pledge themselves that leaves shall reappear, When she has found for them a substitute! TO CRITICS. Ye Dullards, who with precedents would bind The wings of Genius, and so prevent His soaring to the top of his high bent; Know ye not that his soul is as the wind, And blows where'er it lists, to quicken Mind And Matter at its will: omnipotent, And touching all the stops (to find a vent) Of Harmony, responsive to mankind! Think ye old Homer drew from your dead code Of rules the living spirit of his verse, Or that his soul required the critic's goad? Fools! the great Spirit of the universe Had taken up within him its abode, And bade him to all times his tale rehearse! ON A ROBIN. APRIL 20TH. There sits the Red-breast on that budding thorn, Singing it into leaf, for so 't might seem: The whiles unto the music of the stream, Below, he keepeth time, and with the morn Rejoiceth, as it were in very scorn Of all the ills of which we Mortals dream, And fret our hearts at—neverending theme Of vain lament to all of woman born! And he is right—there sits he on the bough, And sings as if it had been ever green, And ever would be, though it has but now Burst into leaf—no more remembering how He fluttered at the window, cold and lean, When all his feathers scarce from frost could screen! ON THE ROUGHNESS OF MY VERSE. My Muse is harsh, they say—ay, so 't may be Perhaps: how could it well be otherwise, When every morn she hears a People's cries For bread? and Nature itself scarce seems free From the wide taint of human misery! She cannot pick her phrases, and be nice, When toiling Virtue stands rebuked by Vice, And Nations starve to keep up pedigree! She's not the silken Muse of drawing-rooms— 'Mid life's stern, bitter truths, she walks the streets, The idle hammer, and the empty looms, By which sits lank Despair, and Hunger cheats, Gnawing his rivelled knuckles: 'mid the seats Of Commerce, which bad laws now make its tombs! ON SEEING THE MOON RESTING ON A HIGH HILL. The Moon, from heaven stooping, the green brows Of Earth salutes, and, mounting to her throne, Whereon she sits most bright and most alone, And nothing near her but the stars allows, Which, at a reverent distance, pay their vows, Upon her sister-planet (so to own A fellowship divine, and make it known To all her stars) a kiss of peace bestows! Lo! for a moment on that hill she rests, Which, dark, and duskier by comparison, Like jewel on an Æthiop's brow, she crests— And now, in glory rising, she anon Of earthly vapours her bright form divests, As though not brooking longer union! AGAINST THOSE CRITICS WHO CAVIL AT THE UNCHRONOLOGICAL JUXTAPOSITIONS OF THE OLD PAINTERS, AND CONDEMN A PLAY OF SHAKSPEARE, BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS ANTIGONUS LANDING WITH PERDITA ON THE SEA-COAST OF BOHEMIA. The Muse has other charts than yours—she has Lands not yet marked, Hesperian isles (in vain Sought for by ye) in Poesy's wide Main: (For these Geography not yet doth class 'Mongst her discoveries!) at which she, as She voyages, touches ever, to obtain Fresh water from some new Castalian vein, Which Commerce, in her dull routine, would pass! O happy, happy he, who with her sails, Her compass true to the great pole of Truth, Though, now and then, she deviate in details— Through literal error reaching purest sooth, She time and space at will doth join and change, To give Truth universal wider range! TO SIR JOHN HANMER, ON FIRST READING HIS SONNETS, JULY, 1842. O Hanmer, simple “Hanmer:”—nobler far As such without addition, than for all Of wealth or name aristocratical, Thine ancestors have left thee: for these are, Though thine, yet not of thee! another star Of Poesy, that makes old lights look small, In thee hath risen—thou hast had a call— Thy name is in the Muses' calendar! I cannot bring thee deathless bays, but yet Accept this poor “Forgetmenot” from me, To twine therewith, when thou shalt simply be Hanmer the “Poet,” not the Baronet— When, save the “Man,” thy fellow-men forget All else, and honor not thy “name,” but “thee!” Thou hast a soul too wide for party-claims— Then wear not thou a mask upon the face Of thy Humanity, to suit mere place And time—God sent thee here for higher aims Than these—to add another to those names, Those calm, enduring names, whose deeper trace, Like a bright star far-shining through all space, The nothingness of earthly objects shames! O thou, who art a poet, do not think That the world's glories can with this compare; O thou, whose lips are privileged to drink At the Castalian fount, take thou no care Of earthly goods, nor from thy calling shrink, But let the Muse thee wholly hers declare! Hear me, not for myself, but for the sake Of that dear Land, to which we both belong Alike: which hearkens to thine early song, As to the lark who doth the morning wake— The new Morn, which e'en now doth overtake The heels of Darkness! do not so much wrong Thyself, who art of voice and wing so strong, As to neglect what God thy task would make— Man made thee “Baronet,” God made thee “Man:” Then be what He hath made thee, before all! The Muse has given thee wings of wider span, And gifted thee with voice prophetical, That thou the chaff of Custom so might'st fan Away, and still be ready at her call! It is no venal tongue would urge thee on— The gall of Envy rankles not on it: Foul-breath'd Detraction doth not on it sit, Mocking Men's merits with Comparison Invidious, and blurring things best done With slimy traces of malignant wit; And turning what was made to benefit To poison, that what it enjoys not, none Beside may taste—not such vile tongue is mine— Unenvious as the lark, I lift my song To greet the dawning of thy light divine, Which doth our day of poesy prolong; Grieved only that it is of wing not strong Enough to reach those lyric heights of thine! Go on then, noble Poet: and all praise And good be with thee still unto the end; Thy steps make music on the Earth, and lend Fresh sweetness to her yet untrodden ways! And, where thy lyre has but rested, bays Memorial spring, as Nature so would send A token after it, and thenceforth blend With her eternal growths thy deathless lays! Go on, and, like the Morning, carry light, And songs, and gladness, with thee through the earth; A new Castalian fount, both deep and bright, Hast thou called forth—Oh there shall be no dearth Of Poesy: the stream shall gather might, Which flows so strong already at its birth! TO ENGLAND. My Country dear; my dear, dear Fatherland! Of all thy many children there are none That love thee more than I do—no, not one! Thou on the mighty Sea hast laid thy hand, And tamed him, like a lion—thou hast spanned The Earth therewith, from rise to set of sun— The mighty winds to do thy bidding run, And o'er the elements thou hast command! Yet do I flatter not, not even thee— Far brighter had'st thou been, star of the Sea, That flam'st upon the forehead of the deep, Had'st thou shone only for Humanitie! A light for all Mankind in view to keep, The star that watches while the World doth sleep! HOW TO SEEK TRUTH. Before a daisy in the grass I bend My head in awe: I could not pluck it thence Without a feeling of deep reverence, As something God has made for a wise end! My whole mind it requires to comprehend The least work of Divine Intelligence, My whole heart, with all feelings deep, intense, Expression to its loveliness to lend! But not so is it with the works of Man— On these I boldly lay my hand, on creeds And dogmas, for these come within my span— Therefore with these articulate blasts I fan The chaff of Custom from Truth's genuine seeds, Like the great wind, that where it listeth speeds! THE PURPOSE OF A LIFE. E'en in my boyish days, ere yet a cloud Of sadness rested on my path, except To make it brighter, when away 't was swept By the strong breath of Hope, so gay and proud, E'en then I've turned aside from the vain crowd, The forms and ceremonies, which intercept The heart's diviner beatings, and have wept For suffering Humanity aloud! Aye, even then I made a boyish vow, In Nature's own grand temple kneeling down, Who set her sign, in token, on my brow, That I allegiance only would avow To him, who wears upon his head the crown Of genuine Manhood, be he king or clown! SUNSET-THOUGHT. Behold yon golden path across the sea, That seems to lead to heaven—unto each And all, from every point, 'tis shown, to teach That even so the path to heaven is free To all men equally, let their degree Be what it may—thus, without aid of speech, By illustration clear, doth Nature preach High truths, and vindicate Humanitie! On a like golden path, to all thus shown, Strewing each step with flow'rs, she leads Man still Up to his Being's height, as to a throne— Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and, Ill From Good still gently parting, she makes known And more the Good, till Man finds Good alone! AMBITION. Glory enough 'twere for the greatest man To write what men should in their mouths still have, Day after day, when he is in his grave— To be identified with things of span And scope perdúrable, that since began The world high mention of mankind still crave: Things with a soul of good in them, to save Them from oblivion, which naught else can— Aye, glory 'twere enough to write a song, That e'en the child upon its mother's knee Should love to sing, and still remember long, Long after, in the days that are to be! And which to mind recalling, he feels strong, Within, the heart of his Humanitie! A CITY, AT SUNSET. The sun is sinking, gorgeous, o'er the hill, And, with his parting smile, lights up the reek Of the great city, rising without break, With quiet motion gently upwards, 'till, Touched by his rays, it seems the air to fill With golden incense, and the heavens to seek: An offering unto God, from many-a meek, Pure, household altar, burning daily still! Yes, that great city, with its thousand homes And hearths, and gentle household fires, is A goodly altar, such as well becomes The God invoked—an altar built to His Religion, and the fair Humanities Of social Life, which there join hands and kiss! ON IMAGINATION. Imagination, godlike faculty, When unto ministering Reason brought To yield obedience, and wings to Thought! To Thought, who, without thee, can not soar high Enough to be sublimed to poesy— Thou art the inspiring heat from heaven caught, In which the dross of earth is fused, and wrought To shapes of beauty, worthy of the sky. Thou art the poor man's treasure—thou canst turn The stones in sunshine on the road to gold— And make his heart e'en at a daisy yearn— While Earth her cornucopia seems to hold For him, and all its riches manifold, When but an ear of corn he can discern! VIEW OF HALDON-HILL, FROM EXMOUTH. Fair hill, that, like a meadow-queen, dost sit By Exe's waters, spreading out thy green And meady skirts down to the stream between Thee and thy sister-hills, a mirror fit To glass such beauty—o'er which come and flit Thy shadows, who art 'mongst the hills a queen, And of thy verdant coronal, with sheen Of sunset, like a crown of emeralds, lit! Lovely art thou, and adding loveliness To all around thee thro' thy silvan reign; But now the thickening shades of twilight press Thine airy brows, and thou dost sink again To rest: while gathering stars, above thee, bless Thee, and, stretched at thy feet, the mighty Main! THE TRUE BENEFACTORS OF MANKIND. Unnoticed goes the great Man thro' the crowd, And yet he is a mighty Influence, Taking a wide sweep and circumference Of Man and Nature—Influence not loud, But deep, and felt where it is least avowed And known—like the great wind, which, scarce to sense Perceptible, nor whither nor yet whence It blows, and yet with power divine endowed, Is known but by the freshness of the earth, To which, when it has passed by, it gives birth! So thro' the crowd he passes, caring not Whether, or how, it estimate his worth— Well knowing that he cannot be forgot, Who with his kind identifies his lot! ON READING SIR J. HANMER'S SONNETS. Great Poet, thou hast scarce yet fledged thy wing, Yet tak'st so wide a sweep of poesy, That thou art lost already to my eye, Upsoaring 'bove the Heliconian spring! Thou need'st no breath of my administering— Yet, with these few, articulate blasts, would I Thy bolder flight urge on admiringly, 'Till, larklike, thou far out of sight dost sing! Sufficient unto me, if I can hear Thee still, tho' longer able not to see, Nor bear thee, so far heavenwards, companie— And, when again to earth thou drawëst near, My herald-song once more shall welcome thee, Joying the earth with music from the sphere! ON REVISITING THE SEA. Roll on, thou mighty Ocean, roll: and fill Mine ear with thy memorial harmony, Once more, as in the days which are gone by: When first thy mighty voice my heart did thrill, Making it gush, as from the rock the rill; And, in thy lap, as in a cradle, I Lay, listening to thy mighty lullaby, The everlasting song thou singëst still! Roll on, and let me think myself the same As when first, in its freshness and its power, Over thine azure brow the great Wind came, Mingling its free breath with thy mighty roar. Two voices, uttering díversely one name, The name of Him, whom they alone adore! ON AN INTELLIGENT ARTIZAN, IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY; OR, TRUE TASTE AND TRUE HUMAN FEELING THE SAME THING. Rude art thou in thy dress, thy fustian-coat, Thy coarse, cloth-trowsers, and thy well-worn hat: Rude art thou in these things, yet what of that? Thou art not rude in soul—thou hast a vote 'Mongst those whose voice the coming age will quote, As of authority to mar or make— The Mass, whose mighty breath alone can wake Fame's trump, and blow a correspondent note! Yes, in thine unassumed Humanity, Thou hast a sanction beyond that of kings, And speak'st, unknowingly, ordainëd things, Which are enduring as the earth and sky— Thy heart within is one of many strings, Touched by the Master's hand unerringly! POETRY. Not only there where rural beauty teems, Stretched at his ease in Nature's fostering lap, The poet thrives, and, as the tree its sap, Draws health and strength, and sweet, congenial themes— But in the throng'd resorts, where men no dreams Indulge, still poring o'er the living map Of human passions, true Parnassian streams Are wanting not.—Humanity her pap Holds to the poet's lips, and he sucks in, From their divinest, truest origin, Both Poesy and Life—yes, even there, With the first beatings of the heart, begin Poetic yearnings: and the highest are Those which Man with his fellow-man doth share! ON LIGHTING MY FIRST FIRE AT HOME, AFTER A CHEERLESS JOURNEY. O genial flame, thou gatherest around Thy household smile the light of other days; This room, (erewhile so vacant) in thy blaze (As these inanimate objects here had found Remitted being, and about me wound With arms of love) draws round me, to displace, With Home's most homesome, dear, memorial face, The stranger-aspect which from all things frown'd— Welcome my old arm-chair: stretch out thine arms, Old friend, and take me to thyself again; Thou hast borne with me in mine hour of pain: There art thou still, 'mid all life's hurts and harms, Haven of rest—the throne, on which I reign O'er Man's best empire, Home, with all its charms! A HARVEST-SKETCH. Ye green hills, circling in your sunny lap Ripe Summer, basking at his length, with crown Of wheaten spike about his forehead brown, And head upon a new-cut sheaf, mayhap, Just laid, and drowsiëd to a noontide nap By its near poppies, freshly ye look down, Cooling the eye, whilst noon all else doth wrap With fiery mantle, gilding field and town— Perennial verdure clothes ye, as it were, A garment, whose green skirts the waters kiss, Keeping it fresh below; whilst, high in air, The cooler winds, whose task it is, repair To fan your queenly brows, lest Earth should miss Your beauty, and her eye lose one great bliss! ON SEEING A VIOLET IN FLOWER, 25TH OF JANUARY. O sweet-breath'd flower, the perfume of the Spring Lingers about thee still—the wandering air In passing, as it toys with thee, doth bear Memorial sweetness with it on its wing: Rude playfellow for such a springtide thing As thou, whom Winter out of love would spare— A pledge, (of which the elements have care) To which the yearning Earth doth blindly cling! So have we something with us to remind Us still of sweets gone by, or yet to come— There is a voice prophetic, never dumb— The gulf is not so wide or deep behind, But Hope and Memory can find out some Device to join hands still, and cheer Mankind! ON BEING TOLD THAT I OVERADVOCATED THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE. Not so, my fellowmen! though I have been Brought up in wealth and bred to luxury: By strong associations bound, which tie Men down to place and circumstance: I've seen, And see, the outline of Man's godlike mien, Like some colossal statue, calm and high, Around whose head the glories of the sky Still linger, though his feet Earth's shadows screen! And, having seen, I see it evermore— A portion of that glory lingers yet E'en on the meanest brow; and I before It bend, (as though God's hand were lightly set On mine own head and bent it down, that debt Sublime to pay,) and God in Man adore! ON PRESENTING A COPY OF MY POEMS TO A PAINTER-FRIEND. Here would the Muse of Poesy (if I Take not her name in vain, who on her call, Whose voice at best is little musical, And ill may charm her to its ministry) Stretch out to her fair sister of the sky, Who bears the rainbow emblematical On her bright head, her hand enriching all, And bid her through the music of the eye Exalt Man and refine—then let each take Him by the hand, and lead him on his way; So shall eternal Beauty with him make Her dwelling still, and, like a cherub, play Before his path, and, as he goes, awake For him fresh harmonies from day to day. ON READING SIR JOHN HANMER'S SONNETS. 1842. Dim, in the twilight, sitteth Poesy, Like some old marble, still and motionless! Upon her eyelids sleep doth lightly press: She hath a dream—and, lo! far up the sky, Climbs a bright star, so still and secretly; And, as it rises, it doth dispossess Her brow of its o'ershadowing thoughtfulness, With calm reflections of eternity! And, lo! she opens up her eyes divine— Long hath she watched and waited for that star, Which to all men henceforth shall be a sign; With heavenly power commissioned to unbar The gates of song, until the full day shine, Which it brings with it, brightening from afar! HOPES OF THE FUTURE. We do not work our wonders with the sword, Dear Countrymen, nor claim aught on such plea— With mothers, and with children on their knee, With patient Thought, and Love, that can afford To suffer, and, by suffering, record His power to atchieve all victorie, With these, and with whatever else may be Gentlest, and with the power of the Word, We work our wonders, which none can gainsay! Unfailingly, as from the grass the flower, The seed divine we scatter by the way, Shall spring, and ripen in its destined hour— Then shout, ye Nations, for the harvest-day Is coming, and the Sun of Truth gains power! ON A LITTLE CHILD. Into the garden came a little child, Quite young in this old world, quite new to all The stops of harmony, so musical, So endless: which so many hearts have thrilled, Long ere he came—yet from which his, by mild And gentle schooling, shall, in its turn, call Forth music too, fresh and original, As though ne'er yet a heart had been beguiled Thereby! delightedly he looked around, Afraid to pluck the flowers for awhile, As if he trod upon enchanted ground— And, at each step, he listened, with a smile, To the sweet music he awaked, profound Yet simple, greatest, least, to reconcile! TO MY MUSE. Onward, my Muse, not backward, lies thy way: Thy portion's in the future, not the past— The sunset of the bygone day doth cast A glory round thee: its last splendors play On the hill-tops and steeples hoar and gray, And the old heights of Time, shedding a last And retrospective gleam on things now fast Into oblivion fading, day by day! Yet in that sunset and its glories old Dost thou rejoice, though but a bygone thing— For thereby is the brighter dawn foretold, Which all that's fair and good in that shall bring Back with it, in more beauty, with a hold More during, that to these Man's heart may closer cling! TO AN ACORN. Thou tiny germ, small source of mightiest things— Great heart in little body, like the Land That bore thee: instrument, to its mighty hand Fashion'd on purpose, that, with the wind's wings, 'T might lift her up to the first place 'mongst kings And kingdoms, and invest her with command Over the elements, for service grand, And led at will, as 't were in leading-strings! Glory to thee, so small as thou now art— The powers of heaven have thy cradle blest, With promised stores of Nature and of Art; Soon shalt thou spread thine arms abroad, and rest On the great sea, the world-uniting mart, Where men meet for Man's common interest! ON A WATERMILL, SEEN ON A SUNDAY IN SPRING. Even inanimate Nature seems to share The blessed quiet of this holy day; The stream, uninterrupted, on its way Glides gently, as if murmuring a prayer! While, through the old elm's foliage, breathes the air Inaudible, with unperceivëd play And undulation, 'mid the pensile spray, As if in Nature's worship part to bear! Yon' wheel, which change and motion both unites, Is now best emblem of their opposites, A living metaphor, in Life's so strange, Yet lovely, poem! so Nature Man requites For keeping one day holy, and invites To thoughts beyond the reach of chance and change! ON HEARING “RULE BRITANNIA” PERFORMED IN ST. PAUL'S, IN CONNECTION WITH THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE. Peal up, thou glorious anthem of our Land, In which a nation, with its mightiest voice, Joins chorus: feeling its great heart rejoice Within it, at the recollections, grand And holy, of the wonders of its hand! Peal up, and fill this ample dome with noise Congenial, and, there suspended, poise Thy mighty volume of sweet sound: expand And fill it out! thy voice is like the sea, Thou ocean-anthem of the brave and free! Unnumbered voices swell the mighty strain, Past generations—all Humanitie— The dead and living—while the mighty main Roars chorus, and God says “Amen,” in heaven again! Peal up, for thou art sung in Freedom's name, (A noble hymn to corresponding theme, Which well the great occasion doth beseem!) For quiet triumphs, not with sword, and flame, And violence, wrought out, but with calm aim, Enduring as the heavens—not a dream Of vain ambition, but a steady beam Of Truth eterne, which dírect from heav'n came! Peal up, and fill the ear of God, for he Delights to hear the voices of the free— Peal up—thou art not sung for courts or kings, But for the glory of Humanitie! Therefore the Nation's heart to thee still clings And cleaves, for thou art played on its heart-strings! ON THE SEA, AFTER A STORM. The sea comes booming with a hollow sound, As he had muffled all his waves, for some Funereal dirge—a melancholy hum Fills all the poring air and earth, around: As if, filled with one sentiment profound Of grief, the elements had been struck dumb; And this great globe were but a muffled drum, Beating the hour which shall all things confound! The winds are hushed, erewhile so wild: their wings Are folded, and they brood upon the sea, Which heaves beneath, as to and fro it swings, Like some great deathbell, booming heavily! Nature seems at a stand: and yet she clings To life, though in her last, deep agonie! ON LOVE. The pomps and splendors of the world, I ween, Have naught to do with Love—nay, they destroy, And, when most deep, disfashion and alloy— They thrust their cold and stately arms, with mien “Blessed be those, How mean soe'er, who have their honest wills, Which seasons comfort.” —Imogen, in Cymbeline. Formal and ceremonious, between Hearts that would meet and mingle in their joy; And, for Love's sweet interpreters, employ (Lest Nature, fine in Love, break down the screen Of hollow forms which hides her holy face) The master of the ceremonies, so To train the heart, poor hack in Fashion's race! While, in some cot, two hearts together grow, With naught, save God, between them to displace, God who is Love, the channel where they meet and flow! ON SHAKSPEAR'S REPRESENTING ANTIGONUS LANDING WITH PERDITA ON THE SEACOAST OF BOHEMIA. Fast sails the fairy-bark—she doth not bear Dull freightage of mere mortal hopes and fears, But costly merchandise, to unknown spheres, The Muse's lands—with sun and stars more fair, And groves elysian—few voyáge there— Yet still, to some great soul, that land uprears Its forehead, glorious, from the deep, who steers His course forthright its wonders to declare! Soft comes the breath of summer from the land, Taking the air with sweetness—'tis the coast Of far Bohemia, a fairy-strand! Oh set not foot thereon, or thou art lost— A great Magician there doth ready stand, And all his spells upon thee will exhaust! Oh let me land: let Fiction bind me fast— There are the footsteps of dear Perdita! The music of the earth doth follow her— And on the common ground still, where she past, The shadow of her loveliness is cast— The Air, her sweeter lips' sweet messenger, Is perfumed still: and, like a loiterer, Lingers around the spot she trod on last! O Muse, still let me sail with thee: and let That land be called Bohemia, or what Thou wilt, though never wave its shores did wet. Thou canst make Truth out of that which is not, And Fiction in the place of Truth canst set, Yet make Truth more when most it seems forgot! ON BURNS' HUMANITY. Oh noble Burns! thy soul was like the lark, That 'neath thy feet sprang up to greet the sky, Yet singing of the earth eternally, And pleading up to heavën—while yet dark It lay beneath thee, thou afar didst mark The Day that cometh in its majesty; And, kindling up thereat thy poesy, With its articulate blasts didst blow the spark! That spark of Love divine, which in thy soul God placed, and which, as still thou sang'st, did grow And kindle, 'till it warmed this mighty Whole— Until that Whole, transfigured in its glow, Revealed to thee the one great Word, the sole Abiding Truth: that Love is all below! TO THE BIRDS. Welcome, ye whom alike the earth and air Rejoice in, welcome to all love and praise— Ye are still with us in our daily ways, And still, where-ever joy is, ye have share, And make it sweeter, and, where 'tis not, bear It with ye still, to many a forlorn place, From healthy breathing and the unbought grace Of Nature nigh shut out, save ye be there! Welcome, for ye are with us day by day, Giving the blessedness of Earth a voice, While the months dance on to your roundelay— The heart of Man, where ye are, doth rejoice, Ye make his dwellings pleasant, like the noise Of waters to the wanderer on his way! AUTHORITY AND INFLUENCE. Authority says unto one man, do This, and he does it: to another, go, And straight he goes—yet 'tis but outward show, Not heartfelt—for an action has no true Significance, save we perform it through An inward prompting: save volition flow Spontaneous as a stream, and round it grow The flowers of Love, whence its sweet source it drew! But Influence takes us gently by the hand, And round our hearts twines close as does the rose Round home's dear porch, with daily presence bland— She is obeyed, and yet doth not command— For she the flowers of duty only shows, Whose thorns wound but the rash who press too close! ON THE QUEEN'S VISIT TO EDINBURGH, ANNOUNCED BY BEACON-FIRES ON THE HIGHER HILLS. Thou firetonguëd messenger, speak on From hill to hill: bound over plain and lea, O'er the green breadth of earth and far-stretched sea, Kindling up fiery comparison Along the mountain-tops, one after one! Till all the far-off shires and counties see The flaming herald of this jubilee, Bounding and gathering strength, each step, upon His mountain-way! Thou, Arthur's-seat, begin, Lift up thy fiery crest into the sky, And give the tidings fitting origin— And ye, reflecting fires, far and nigh, Link after link, the flamewrought chain outspin, And glad the isles with your bright heraldry! And, lo! it rises, streaming on the air, With its huge breadth of long-extended trail, Lashing the darkness, like a Comet's tail, And flickering on the foreheads hoar and bare Of the old mountains, with its umbered glare, Haloing their solemn brows, as if they were Earth's antediluvian forefathers, without heir Or issue, save themselves, to tell the tale! Bound forth, bright herald, to Carnethy's hill: And bid him take the word and pass it on, With fiery speech, and all the Pentlands fill: And o'er the ocean let it flash anon, Dreaming on things to come, so calm and still, Like an old prophet in the days long gone! [“Thou art no better than thy fellow men] Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor. “Thou art no better than thy fellow men, Yet would'st instruct them in the way to go!” 'Tis true I am not—but may I not show The path, as does a signpost, even when I follow not myself? if but some ten, Nay one, the true path to Man's greatness so Finds out, and puts in act what I but know, Still as a signpost thou may'st thank my pen— I am no better than the least: but yet, After my kind, and in my poor degree, I labour to repay the common debt, Which all men owe unto Humanitie; And, if my song from that root grow, its plea Will hold good, and men store by it will set! ON SENDING SOME SONNETS TO THE EDITOR OF THE EXAMINER. If thy far-reaching telescope, which takes So wide a compass of Humanity, And the horizon of its farthest sky, With stars of the first size, whose luminous wakes Leave tracks of light (like streaks when morning breaks) On Time's horizon, can mark such as I, And this faint star of dawning poesy, Which small show 'midst these greater glories makes: If thou canst notice it, and let its ray Shine on thy page, and light a glowworm space, Though that be too much where each line hath grace And force, and lends a tongue to Truth, to say Her thoughts divine, 'twill labour to repay The favour, and to shine with brighter face! PARALLEL BETWEEN THE ARCHITECTS OF CATHEDRALS, AND OF THE MORAL FABRICS OF SOCIETY. As, when some Genius hath planned a pile Of scope perdúrable, where Faith her wings May spread at large, and to the invisible things Of God upsoar, the multitude meanwhile The tool, the instrument, (though blind, not vile, For it, though labouring darkly, cleaves and clings To the great work it works out) which he brings To bear, and doth adapt and reconcile To his great hand—so the true architects Of Time foreshape the age that is to be, Which generations, each in its degree, Opinions, creeds, religions, systems, sects, The united labour of Humanitie, Work out, whilst God, the Master, all directs! ON SEEING, OR, RATHER, NOT SEEING, WESTMINSTER ABBEY. I entered from the crowded street, and all The noise of passing Life, behind me, died Out, like the murmur of the ebbing tide Of some great sea, in distance musical! I thought to leave it for awhile, its small And jostling interests, its pomp and pride, And step from out it, with a regal stride, A monarch of the Dead, and wrap the pall Around me, like a royal robe of state! But Life, in all its littleness, was there Before me, and, as at a tollbar-gate, A fee is asked of all who would repair To pass an hour with the departed Great, And Mammon of God's temple has the care! Oh Metropolitan Heart, thine is the blame, That, sleeping, liest with head in Mammon's lap, And, waking, bow'st the knee, and doff'st the cap— Thou that, for greater sin and deeper shame, Permittest such things in Religion's name! Rise, thou that art to England as the pap Of chief support, arise, and round thee wrap Thy power, like a garment, and thy fame! Stretch out thy mighty arm, upon which thou (Like Power leaning on his own right hand) Art dozing, and, with voice of full command, Thine indignation at such acts avow— Things of more pith and scope thy hand hath spanned Ere this, and it ought not to fail thee now! ON MOZART, WHO LIVED IN NEGLECT, AND DIED IN POVERTY. O Genius, waiting in the courts of kings With menials, who oft higher wages get, As if thou, and not they, incur'dst the debt: As if thy works sublime were but playthings T' amuse an idle hour, and the strings, On which thou dost all harmony beget, And to the music of Creation set, Were but a common fiddler's offerings! Alas for thee: thou, who should'st eat the bread Of Immortality, when thus constrained To pick the crumbs that fall where fools have fed! Thou, who wert made to utter things ordained, To whom the world doth listen—whom, when dead, It worships, though when living it disdained! ON A LATE FLOWERING FORGETMENOT. SEPTEMBER 14TH. Forgetmenot!—no, I will not forget Thee, little flower, by the bare roadside— Thou dost recal the glories of springtide, When the full stream of loveliness had set In with its first, deep flow, from violet And primrose, sweetening into maiden pride, To the rich rose, and lily, which doth hide Its drooping head in valleys moist and wet— Stray flowër, that hast outlived all thy kind, Reminder of those who themselves remind! Thou call'st up that fresh time, when at the skies Earth, through ye and your thousand azure eyes, Gazed, like a blue-eyed child, as if to bind Man's youth to her's by close affinities! SCANDAL-MONGERS. The fœtid breath of Scandal hits not me, It fouls the foul, and in their nostrils stinks— The prude, who at her sister's fault ne'er winks, But, open-eyed, is still the first to see The mote in her eye, in the same degree Blind to the beam in her own vision, shrinks, Affectedly, at pleasure's name, yet drinks More of the “stolen waters,” on that plea! Out on them, and their whole envenomed tribe, That poison social intercourse divine— The gall of Juvenal would scarce describe Them fitly, though nought else so well could bribe His pen splenétic to words masculine, As Vice that would, as Virtue, Virtue undermine. ON SOME OLD ARMOUR. Old brand, hung up in hall memorial, Hauberk and helmet with armorial crest, The rust now eats ye, ye have seen your best Of days, ye answer no more to the call! Hard blows ye've seen and given, and the fall Of many-a rider on earth's bloodstained breast, In mortal strife: but now ye are at rest, Like those ye witness of on this old wall! Ye have a strife more mortal to wage now: Ye, who long preyed on others, are the prey Of Time, who moulds ye into spade and plough, And ploughs up for Truth's seeds, which, through ye, lay Unsown, your fields, and heals Earth's deep-scarr'd brow, That Peace may kiss her cheek, and with her stay! ON THE CLOSE OF A MOST BEAUTIFULLY CALM AND SUNNY DAY. SEPTEMBER 13TH. This lovely day, so full of life and love, This summer in itself, nay, life almost, Lingers on its sweet way, as if it cost The earth below, and heaven itself above, A pang to part from it! no thing doth move, Save, in the sun, yon' flies, of change or frost Not dreaming, but bent solely to exhaust Their happy lives, and every hour improve, As if such things could never be! and I, Stilling th' importunate voice of consciousness, Almost believe as they, undoubtingly Enjoying this day's perfect loveliness; For, if it were to last eternally, Lovelier it could not be, and might be less! ON THE ROSEMARY. Sweet Rosemary, the tomb and altar claim Joint shares in thee, for office different, And yet both with a common sentiment: Under the twofold aspect (yet one, same Deep truth) of hope and memory—thy fame, And that rare privilege, (as Nature meant Thee for such service, Winter's ornament) Have made for thee an old, memorial name! Thou flowerest when old Christmas, all-a-cold, Sits over comfortable fires, in mind To keep thy painted compeers, not so bold— So art thou for remembrance well designed— Nor less for hope: as giving manifold Assurance of renewal to thy kind! ON THE CHRISTMAS CUSTOM OF LIGHTING THE NEW LOG AT THE REMNANT OF THE OLD. At the memorial log of the last year We light that of the next, and so hand on, Theme of traditional comparison And quaint remembrance, that old fire, clear And strong, of household love and usage dear; With a transmitted bond of union, It links the days to come with those long gone, A rallying-point for each domestic sphere— So, in a wider sphere, but with like aim, We light the Vestal fire, on which depends The nation's welfare, at the antique flame, And from the old the new to heaven ascends: Stronger and purer burning, yet the same, And lighting us more clearly to like ends! ON THE DRUIDS CUTTING MISTLETOE WITH A GOLDEN SICKLE, FOR THEIR RITES. With golden sickle emblematical, For precious as the office was the make, The Druids cut the sacred plant, and brake It not in ruder fashion, at the call Of their old worship quaint and mystical. Deep truth lay in that rite, and, for its sake, Let us, still labouring the good to take, And leave the evil, not reject it all! The golden sickle with which Man all good May reap, is Love—and if he gather e'en A branch of mistletoe, in loving mood, To deck his house or temple, he has been Using that golden sickle, understood Aright, and not its mere similitude! TO THE SCORNERS. Sneer thou who hast a right to sneer at all, Though at the meanest of thy fellow-men— But I forget—forgive thee—and so then We're quit: or, rather, thy dull sneer doth fall Back on thyself, and its unchristian gall Thy heart, thy life's springhead, embitters; when Thou scorn'st a fellow-creature, thou art ten Times worse: his fault compared with thine is small. For he, who sins from want of Love alone, Breaks all commandments, since they all are based On Love: as almost all faults are effaced Through it, for him who Faith with Love doth crown— The circle, drawn from God, where lie embraced All duties, from the cottage to the throne! TO MAN. O what is Man, that he should, poor, frail thing! Walk on the greenwove carpet of the grass: While flowërs, 'neath his steps, as he doth pass, Shoot up, to make their scented offering? What is he, that still, as he goes, the spring Makes music for his hearing, and the mass Of Nature's wonders strive which shall surpass In doing him most service, like a King! Wherefore all this, O Man? because thou art Endowed with intellect majestical, Looking before and after, and a heart To love all things—therefore art thou of all This lovely world sole lord—Nature and Art Kneel at thy feet, and thee their master call! ON A DEWDROP IN THE SUN. Look at that diamond in the grass, as pure As all Golconda's mines can furnish forth, And, in my sight, not of inferior worth! You smile, and stare at me with face demure, Checking a sneer—oh friend, he is not poor, Whom these things can make rich: for whom the earth, This common earth, yields treasures without dearth, And oh! than gold and gems how more secure, How much more durable! a grain of gold No jeweller would give me for that gem, Strewn, with its countless fellows, on the hem Of Nature's garment, for all to behold! Yet here I kneel, in spite of thee and them, And kiss it, as I would not a King's diadem! For she has ruled me with a gentle hand, A hand of love: and, for the love I gave Her back, she bade me take what I would have, And placed the earth and air at my command! And, on her endless stores so lovely, grand, And varied, gazing long, I did but crave, While others, with the heart's affections, pave The way to wealth and greatness in the land, That she would make me love a flower more Than gold, and pomp, and all earth's fleeting store; And, smiling, she assented, and thus spake: Be henceforth mine, and, while the rest adore And sweat for gold, a flower, for my sake, Shall be to thee the wealth which they mistake! TO IMOGEN. Oh flower of womanhood, on regal stem Growing so queenly in thy loveliness, Yet lowly as the daisy, and with less Assumption, though born to a diadem, Than the poor peasant who thy royal hem Doth kiss, and higher sovereignty confess Than that of those who sit on thrones, and dress In purple and fine linen! not of them Art thou, O rose of May, that, in thy scent And sweetness, growest in the courts of Kings, As in a waste, too-precious ornament! Far happier, had Love lent thee his free wings, To fly to some still nook, where thou, content, Had'st bloom'd, as do the flowers by the springs! Thou wast not made to bloom, thou modest rose, On the bold front of royalty, whereon All look, to make free-tongued comparison, And blush for its offences, and for those Who for themselves ne'er blush, but still impose That task on others, like thee, who have none Committed, but, instead, grace unbought won To that which has none itself, nor bestows! Nature had worn thee in her favour still, Her loveliest flow'r—no envious poisoner Of sweets himself tastes not, had wrought thee ill, Under the show of good: nor made thee err In judgment, who could not subdue thy will: But she had claimed thee all, as thou did'st her! ON A QUIET SUMMER-EVENING, BY THE SEA. The wind, that now scarce stirs upon the rose Its lightest leaf, and, like a roseleaf, now Before it sweeps the oak, with humbled brow, Breathes like a sleeping child! all things compose Themselves to stillness: 'tis as Day would close His eyes in peace, and this vexed Earth allow A breathing-pause: and closed them musing how To rise in fresher beauty from repose! Lo! o'er yon' hill he takes a last, brief look, Upkindling once more, like a poet's eye, Who has read things divine in some old book! And, oh! has he not done so verily? From the first glance which through morn's gates he took, To this, now, like a flower, closing silently! Oh! has he from more than a book not read, However old, howe'er poetical! However grand and deep, and full of all That's wonderful, more than was ever said Or sung, by all the living and the dead! In Epic breadth more than Homerical, In grace Bucolic more than Pastoral, And more than all in all things: more than head E'er thought or heart e'er felt! Oh yes, he has! He has read glorious things from morn to eve, In that grand volume where a blade of grass Might make a poet thoughts divine conceive! And, as he sinks, his Maker now doth glass His glory in him, and His image leave! Yes, like the eye of God, that orb doth shine, With a last look of love and blessedness, On Earth, who, like a queen, in summer's dress, Sits by the mighty Ocean, and doth twine Fresh flowers in her hair, his bride divine; On whose green lap, with murmurous caress, He lays his azure brows, while she doth press Her flowery lips to his, fresh from the brine! Yes, like the eye of God, so calm and clear, It takes a lingering look of this fair scene, And sees that all is good, as it has been, And ever will be; while, to be read ne'er Again, another page divine turns ere It sinks, but still the last word, “God,” is seen! Still, like the grand “Amen” of the last line, By hand divine inscribed! while soft the lid Of darkness closes o'er Day's eye, and, hid, Its glance of love no more on earth doth shine! But on the forehead of dim Night, a sign Not to be misinterpreted, amid The starry scrolls in which 'tis set, to guide And cheer, 't will head another page divine! On which all Heaven, with its countless eyes Fixed ever, gazes, while the spheres around, Like choiristers, go hymning through the skies, And filling the vast temple with their sound! Till the new morn takes up their harmonies, A fresh-turned page of Being to expound! ASPIRATIONS. Yes, I shall live, and men of me shall speak In time to come, and, on its mother's knee, The little child shall learn a verse from me; Shall learn to love the flowers, with a meek And gentle love, and all its pleasures seek In Nature's lap: and all that it can see, Yea, every living thing, in its degree, To love and cherish, be it strong or weak! Yes, I will be a household Lar, that o'er The fireside still watches, and which there With words and acts of love men best adore— For I have wrought from love, and ask no more For recompense than love, that men may wear Me in their hearts, as them in mine I wore! ON GOING A SHORT DISTANCE OUT OF LONDON, IN THE SPRING. Far am I from all voice of citied life: No sound thereof comes here; or, if it does, 'Tis like the ocean's, hushed and murmurous In distance—all the petty care and strife, The jar of sin and suffering, so rife In peopled deserts, like an incubus Upon the breast of social Man, are thus Awhile forgot; and, like a loving wife, Who takes her truant husband back again, Though he hath lately played the libertine, Me to her holy breast doth Nature strain, With the old love, in its first force divine! And round me all her new-grown flowers doth twine, Like loveknots, the more sweetly to constrain! TO THOSE WHO MEASURE MEN BY THEIR WEALTH AND APPEARANCE. “He is an outcast”—aye, but more a Man— A coin, which bears still on its much-rubbed face That stamp, though tarnished of the minter's grace, Which gives all currency—and would ye scan It closer, and the dust of Custom fan Away, which lies thick on it, ye might trace God's image, which for Mammon's ye displace, Effacing in the end what God began! Go, weigh it in the scales: it is not light, Save in your estimation, and should pass Though 't were but for the figure's sake! what right Have ye to mark as base that which God has Put into circulation, and which might Contain more gold, though worn, than ye have brass! SELF-ENCOURAGEMENT. Rise up, my Muse: a cloud on thee hath been, While yet but crescive in thy faculty, And, with the full moon of thy poesy, Bear on with thee the clouds that intervene, Which erst prevented thee from being seen: Or gild them with thy light, in passing by, And leave them on thy way forgetfully, Calm in the strength of thine acknowledged sheen! The Earth has sent up envious mists, from time To time, to dim the brightness of thy face: But thou to upper air meanwhile didst climb, Freeing thyself from neighbourhood so base: And now thou hast full scope to run thy race, In bright companionship with things sublime! RETROSPECTIVE. Fortune hath stood between me and the plan I fashioned for my youth and set apart— Some one to love, in singleness of heart, And Love me for myself, a simple man, An unspoilt child of Nature—one who can Not bear the chains of fashion or of art, Still less the barter of the social mart, Where Truth and Nature lie 'neath Custom's ban. Yet could I love in very simpleness Of heart, and dally with the innocence Of Love, like the old age—for, I profess, The world hath not another recompense, Nor aught, in after-life, like Love to bless, Sought for itself, without end or pretence! ON PEACE BEWEEN ENGLAND AND AMERICA. Oh England, to thy daughter of the sea Stretch out thine hand, in pledge of faith renewed, And let the great Sea, which doth both include, Between ye natural mediator be, To bring ye still together, on the plea Of mutual welfare and similitude Of blood and manners: linking ye, through good And evil, like two sisters fair and free! He hath a missionry of love between Ye still to execute, his daughters twain: To make ye greater than ye yet have been, And give ye conjoint empire o'er the main— For Peace divine he brings still in his train, And Freedom ever at his side is seen! STATECRAFT SIMPLIFIED. The rules of individual life are clear— And if, from their true centre, the one Man, We stretch them, yet unforced, to their full span, They will with ease embrace each widening sphere Of human action, 'till they disappear In endless circles, far, far wider than Earth's range, 'till lost in God, who himself can Not violate, nor with them interfere! The interests of nations are the same As those of the one Man: their duties too— The Gordian-knots of statecraft, some cut through With the sword, defeating, in the end, their aim, Justice and Truth with gentle hand undo, And out of difficulties triumphs frame! THE PRIDE OF THE FOREST. Old oak, that wear'st the glory of thy years About thee, like a garment: thou art young At heart, though in thy boughs the birds have sung For many an age: and joy has been, and tears, And changes on the earth, and hopes and fears, Since thou wert planted; many a spring hath hung Its green robes on thee, ages hast thou flung A kingly shadow o'er thy forest peers! Old Patriarch of many days, the wind Amid thy branches takes a solemn tone, Well suited to its powers and thine own: Giving thee influence above thy kind, And voice oracular, so to make known Ordainëd things to whom it is assigned! ON SEEING A FINE MERCHANT-VESSEL COMING OUT OF PORT. Like a sea-bird she sits upon the sea: And now unto the wind she opens out Her white wings, wearing gracefully about, As if she held the elements in fee: And, stretching forward on her mission, she Leans after it, as 't were, as if in doubt Awhile which way to take; then, with a stout Resolve, she seeks the main, with motion free And high-magestical—about her play The ministering winds, the waves make way, As for some creature of the element, And Ocean flings upon her brows his spray, Baptizing her to full accomplishment Of the great quests of Peace, on which she's sent! REFLECTIONS ON PUBLISHING MY POEMS. Pardon, my fellow-man, if I in aught Have sinned against the Truth—I have not set Down aught in malice: but we may forget, And that be wrong which was sincerely thought— Much labour, and of love more, have I brought To this my task, for 'tis a sacred debt— For Thought doth in immortal kind beget His issue, with commensurate evil fraught Or good, when once made known—O pardon then: For, in the name of our Humanity, To thee, though least of all thy fellow-men, I owe a strict account of all that I Have wrought, for good or evil, with my pen, The sceptre of all spiritual sovereignty! And something at thy hands too I deserve: That sympathy, by which, as Man, I live, The love I seek alone for all I give— Much has it cost of firmness, not to swerve From my once-chosen path: much to preserve That simpleness of mind, which doth survive, In spite of all: though Custom 'gainst it strive, And want of sympathy at times unnerve. Much have I borne: still more forborne: and rent Old ties in twain, like tendrils of the heart: Harsh words I've heard, and, far worse, missed my part Of kind ones, with their sweet encouragement; Yet bate I not a jot of hope, but start Afresh, to do that for which I was sent! TO THE CHARTISTS, UPON THEIR SUPPRESSING PUBLIC MEETINGS. Ye fools, who clamour for the “Charter” so, And yet, in seeking it, defeat the end Ye yourselves have in view—why would ye bend The necks of others to your yoke? to show How little ye true freedom love or know? If such as ye were destined to ascend Her social heights, your vision might extend Beyond these views of party, and thence throw A glance upon the great map of mankind; Learning that Freedom is in reach of those Alone, who, claiming free use of their mind, The channels of Opinion never close: Which with a thousand different courses wind, And mix in Thought's great sea, from whence they rose! ON SOME FLOWERS ABOUT A NEAT COTTAGE DOOR. Oh sight beyond all others passing-dear! The love of Nature is the love of all That's good, and beautiful, and rational— And he, who has but taken pains to rear A rose about his door, extends his sphere Of being and enjoyment—he a call Has had, and caught the voice poetical, Which speaks through all her lovely works so clear. And, by that rose, she leads, in gentle guise, Him, by the hand, as 't were, upon his way, And round him all life's fair humanities Calls by degrees; for she will not betray The heart that trusts her, but, with closer ties, Towards her draws, nor lets it go astray! ON SEEING A BEAUTIFUL REVENUE-CUTTER PUT OUT TO ASSIST A VESSEL IN DISTRESS. Sea-Swallow, skimming o'er the crested waves, As if endued unto the element, On what swift-wingëd mission art thou bent, That, while the wind, at fiercest, 'round thee raves, And the seamew alone the tempest braves, Thou venturest forth, like hound upon the scent Just loosed, and without one presentiment Of ill, or that those billows can make graves? All good be with thee: for the heart of Man Wafts prayers and wishes after thee, to fill Thy sails with breaths propitious, and to still The tempest—nor could aught be likelier than Man's prayer for Man to bend th' Almighty's will, Could he, for such things, change the world's great plan! TO SHAKSPEAR. O godlike spirit, open as the day To every influence of Humanity! Heart, like the ocean in capacity, That takest in, as if 't were but in play, So great thine ease, so sovereign thy sway, All streams of feeling, mingled healthfully In thy broad bosom, and thence filtered, by A thousand channels, into showers of May, Quickening where-e'er they fall! oh soul divine, To whom all streams are tributary here, That tak'st all others, and yet mak'st them thine, And send'st them forth again more pure and clear! Deep reservoir of Good—exhaustless mine, Rich as the earth, mankind at large to cheer! ON MISTAKEN GRANDEUR. Thou stately soul, so full of dignity, That canst not stoop from thy surpassing height Of greatness, to do once, in very spite Of all thy state, an act of kindness! why Would'st thou do good, pray, thus vicariously, And rob thyself of that so dear delight, Which else would have belonged to thee of right, The still voice whispering sweetly from the sky? Why must thou ring the bell, that servile hand May take the thorn from out that poor hound's foot? Wast thou not bid to do it, by command Of thy Lord as of his? to execute Whose least, least wish e'en kings should run or stand: And whom thou servëst, serving e'en that brute! ON A LOVELY REFLECTION IN WATER. Hast thou, when, on their downy wings, the winds Have lulled themselves to rest, like sea-birds, seen A landscape pictured in a lake's calm sheen, Where old, familiar objects the eye finds, But glorified, as 't were: freed from those blinds Of earthliness, through which, as through a screen Of mist, we darkly saw? yet there, I ween, The soul may be, though sense the body binds, Translated also! yet the most real life Is that of soul, for, where our souls are, what Else want we? thus it is and it is not! Like a bright bubble, which to sight doth live, But not to touch—then touch it not—but give It scope—'tis real, till thou hast this forgot! MEANS OF CIVILIZATION. With things of little cost, of every day, As common as kind words and gentle looks, And daily greetings, and familiar books, That teach us wisdom while it seems but play: With means at hand still by life's daily way, As natural as flowers by the brooks, As pleasant as field-paths thro' sylvan nooks, And so cheap that the poorest can defray The expense thereof: with these, and things like these, We work our wonders by the fireside: Our magic-charms, the kiss of love and peace; Our magic-circles, small at first, but wide Enough at last to grasp the world with ease, Homes, where God, as in temples, doth reside! ON THE SEASHORE, ON A STORMY DAY. The wild wind, and still wilder sea, now make Together chorus rude, yet passing-grand: While the old, choral rocks, along the strand, Forth, in harmonic concert, fitful break, And from the winds and waves an utterance take; Music, beyond the reach of mortal hand, Well-suited to the tempest, which hath spanned Ocean and Air, with power to awake Their mighty melodies—yea, every wave Hath now a voice, and, quiring, to the shore It comes, then, rising from its vocal grave, Joins to the next its congregated roar— A multitudinous harmony, which cave And cliff re-echo, making it still more! TO TIME. Oh Time, so deaf, and dumb, and blind, to all Who would from the direct forthright, with bribes Or flattery turn thee, Literature's pay'd Scribes And Pharisees, who at the corners call Aloud, and for the World's approval bawl, While, in the vulgar race, the courtiers' kibes The citlings gall, and swell the venal tribes, Like buzzing flies, and as ephemeral, That flyblow present Havings—thou an eye Hast ever open to perceive Truth, where So e'er she lurk, far down, or up-on high: An ear to hear her voice, a tongue to cheer! Therefore in thee I trust, and, without fear, Still journey onward in thy company! TO NAPOLEON. Great instrument indeed, but not great Man— Means of great good, by thyself not designed: Unconscious giver of light unto the blind, Of freedom unto slaves—thy course began In purposed good, but widened, as it ran, To headlong evil: leaving thee to find Power with it, or to be left behind, As one who could the storm he raised not span! Thou wert a thunderbolt, that smit the thrones Of Kings, dismaying all earth's crownëd drones, And rousing nations who were half asleep. So the much good, thou didst not mean, atones The more ill thou didst mean: letting the deep, True fountains of Man's Thought their free course keep! ON PLUCKING A FLOWER. Mine eyes are dim with tears, my heart is full: This little flower hath subdued me quite! It hath loosed all the fountains of delight Within my heart, and not alone I pull That flower, but all sweets of Nature cull Therewith—enjoyment perfect, infinite, Which opens up, in all its depth and height, This world, so lovely and so wonderful! O God, how rich must be the heart of Man! When e'en a little flower by the way, Brings, if its beauty's felt, within his span This world, and all the harmonies that play Throughout it: till he thinks he can, and can Indeed, hear some new music every day! WRITTEN WITH A STRAY FEATHER FROM CUPID'S WING. She is another's p'rhaps, and has forgot Me quite: so have not I forgotten her! A flower she had worn I would prefer To all the wreaths poetic for my lot Reserved—a lock of hair to riches, not To me so precious—yes, I will aver, One kiss of hers, the very harbinger And messenger of Love, by it begot Ere well announced, would more than compensate The frowns of all the Muses and of Fate! Alas! the joyous and the flowery prime Is past, and I regret the loss too late: While th' Hesperian fruit, which I did climb The tree of knowledge for, comes not in time! SUNSET. The golden foot-prints of departing Day Are fading from the ocean silently, And Twilight, stealing onward, halves the sky; One after one they fade in light away, While, with a thousand songs, the Earth doth say Farewell, uplifting all her mountains high, To catch the last reflections ere they die, As, one by one, their peaks grow cold and gray. Yon' orb, that hangs upon the ocean's rim, Looks, Januslike, both back and forward too, And, while it fades here to Earth's evening-hymn, It brightens, from afar, o'er regions new, Unto the songs of Morning, raised to Him, Who thus 'twixt night and day the great line drew! TO NELSON. Yes! thou wert not deceived: 'twas no vain dream On one occasion, Nelson despaired of rising in his profession, without interest, as he was, and embarrassed by many difficulties, but after a gloomy reverie, he felt a sudden glow of patriotism, and his country presented itself to him in the light of a patron, and, from that hour, he saw, with his mind's eye, a radiant orb suspended over him, which urged him on. See his own words. Which the brain makes of fumes—that orb so bright, Which shone on thee in Disappointment's night, When not for thee or thine the golden stream Of Fortune flowed, and shed her star no gleam Upon thy darkness, was the quenchless light, The spiritual Sun, that shines in spite Of earth-drawn clouds, and doth our steps redeem From error, when Earth's other stars grow faint! It was thy sun of glory, and it shone Around thee, like the halo round a saint, Cheering thee still thine ocean-race to run— And urging thee, by a divine constraint, To think that all things might, with it, be done! Thou didst not need a patron, nor wast made To cringe and smile in antechambers, or To wait on Kings, who wast their creditor For debts which crowns could never have repaid! Whose single head more genuine laurels shade Than all their kind can boast—the conqueror Of nations, thou wast made to lay down law, Not take: not to obey, but be obeyed! Thou didst not need a patron—the great Land, That suckled thee, had nursed thee with her best, And given thee a voice which had command; And, like a mother, sent thee forth, and blest (Who never blest her sons in vain) thy hand To deeds, which are a Nation's best bequest! Thou didst not leave her riches, which soon make Wings to themselves, nor fleeting goods of earth, As full of change as is their place of birth: Nor aught that Fortune, who but lends, can take Away again, or put again to stake Of gambling Hazard—something of more worth, A fount of good, which never shall know dearth, Thou'st left her, to be cherished for her sake And thine—a name, which is a word of power, And an example, in which thou art still, A guardian-presence, with us, in the hour Of danger, like an arm to ward off ill, Thrust through the clouds that o'er thy country lour, Like that of God, the agent of His will! REMINISCENCES OF BOYHOOD. Alas! as with a sponge, Time hath effaced The lines of favour, hath rubbed out the sum Of youthful years, which never more will come; Another harder score must now be traced, And that by harder, in its turn, displaced! How many voices of delight are dumb, How many glimpses of Elysium Are gone, how many bright hopes, vainly chaced! Alas! how shall I find that wealth again, Which coined its golden pleasures from the dross Of common circumstance, yet bearing, plain As Truth, God's holy impress? joys whose loss Gold cannot compensate, nor all Earth's vain And glittering baubles, with their hollow gloss! The best things are not to be bought with gold— They do not flutter round Power's diadem, Moths of court-favour, nor upon the hem Of Greatness light obsequious, when told, Poor, gilded butterflies, killed with the first cold! They are not won by force or stratagem, Nor caught with Fashion's bait, or Beauty's gem: These cannot win, nor, could they win them, hold! So thought I when, a merry boy, I saw The gilded pomps of this vain world pass by, While fools looked on with envy or with awe! So think I now, and, with a steady eye, I scan each mote, and weigh each gilded straw, In the sure balance of Humanity! TO AN ARBUTUS. The arbutus, like the orange, bears contemporaneously flowers, and fruit in all stages of ripeness. OCTOBER 1. Fair shrub, thick-strewn with flowers and bunchëd fruit, With hum of happy bees all-murmurous, Spring lingers 'mid thy boughs, with Autumn, thus A sweet comparison to institute, And of thee the possession to dispute— Bright butterflies enjoy thine overplus Of sweets, and bees turn to still better use Thy late abundance, and their hives recruit. Thy berries mock the lip, flattering the eye With the sweet strawberry's red livery— Thy flowers, like fairy bells, stir lightly in The odorous air, while the bees' merry din Might seem the peal, for high festivity, 'Mongst them, and all their airy kith and kin! ON THE BIRTH OF MY MUSE'S FIRST CHILD. My Muse has been in labour, and is now Confined—oh may the Graces all be there, To bless the birth with all earth has of fair, And heaven of good—and may Apollo vow A votive garland for its future brow, And what he promises in mind still bear, A true godfather, if so much I dare To ask, or he so largely may endow! For, oh! my Muse, thy child is not begot Of casual fruition unendeared, But in approvëd fashion, without blot Or stain, in wedlock holy and revered. For I have loved (as woman I have not) Thee ever, and to thee alone adhered! And, oh! if thou deceiv'st me, where am I? Long did I woo thee, and, when thou didst smile At last, that smile alone seemed to beguile All labour, and to make it luxury— And, having served thee long and faithfully, And laboured to approve myself meanwhile, And thee so to my love to reconcile, We were made one in holy matrimony! And, oh! my bride divine, thou hast not played The wanton, or the heart I gave betrayed: Thou took'st me not for wealth or name, but for The love I bore thee, and the vow I made. And as I thee alone to love then saw, So is thy love still my reward and law! ON THE FIRST INTRODUCTION OF THE PRIMROSE INTO NEW HOLLAND BY A LADY. The primrose was in flower when the lady landed, carrying it in a bottle; and, at sight of the homely, memorial flower, the convicts crowded round her, many deeply moved, even to tears. She comes, like Memory, calling up what each Of dearest had, in other times and climes: When the heart's springheads, tainted since by crimes, Gushed fresh, and freshening all within their reach. O flower, far more eloquent to teach Repentance than the priest, the dear, old chimes Of other days come up with thee, the times Of innocence: a text from which to preach Intelligibly to each softened heart! Thanks, thanks, for teaching us that we may still Find, in each human breast, through all, some part Left of the virgin-soil: where, with small skill, The seeds of Good, new-sown, may make fresh start And root, and, by degrees, subdue the ill! CONTENTMENT, IN WHAT IT LIES. How many lovely things have I desired, Which I could not have had, though I had all The wealth of earth and power Imperial! The fair maid for my wife, the all-admired, Who trod the earth as if it was inspired By her sweet footing, and grew musical! The voice of power, the poet's pen, to call Forth feeling, like a fountain, when required! And yet how little did I truly need Of all! but 'round me, wiser now, I draw A circle, beyond which I never tread— My heart! and there, of all I ever saw Or heard of Beautiful, I keep indeed The best part, and the rest nor miss nor heed! TO CERTAIN FINGER-RHYMERS. I cannot stop to pick shells by the way, When the great sea is roaring wide and near— I cannot do these things: they interfere With the more present matter, and make play Of the great thoughts that on my spirit lay Divine constraint, and my soul onward bear, Like the deep sea, forthright in its career, Till it has given voice to what 't would say! I cannot dwell on secondary things, Nor minute-stop, to th' answering click of rhyme, Exactly, each beat of my Muse's wings— She takes a wide sweep of the air, to climb As some persons are apt to take everything literally, and weigh a metaphor as they would a fact, I may remark, once for all, in reference to such passages, that the poet does not so much expresss his sense of his own merits, as endeavour to express his thought in the most striking manner; in doing which himself is the last thing, perhaps, that occupies him, till he finds an apology necessary for forgetting that he had been praising himself. The sphere, like Morning, and Creation's strings So touch, at either end, with flight sublime! ON A CHILD, SITTING IN THE SUMMER-GRASS. There sits the little child, lost in deep thought: Absorbed into complete unconsciousness Of all save what doth so supremely bless! All influences of sense and sight have wrought Upon it sweetly—Nature's self has brought It all her flowers, and, with a caress, Poured them into its little lap, to dress Itself withal, with ornaments unbought! The bird hath sung to it the livelong day, The sun shone on it, and the wind doth play With its soft hair, a gentle play-fellow— Its heart is full: so full it cannot say One word—but, like a fountain, it doth flow Within, and there makes music none may know! ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE VESSEL ANNOUNCING THE SETTLEMENT OF DIFFERENCES WITH AMERICA. There comes a gallant vessel, in full trim, Into the haven, high-majestical, With music in her motion, as if all The waves, o'er which she doth so lightly skim, Rose up and sank in cadence, to each whim And playful fancy of her rise and fall! The sun is sinking, gilding yon' dark pall Of clouds, whose edges even now grow dim, Ready to close around the grave of Day! But whence comes she, with sails the sun makes gold, To fit them golden missions to convey? Brings she Hesperian fruitage, long foretold, From the far West? Oh yes, she comes to say She brings its best fruit, Peace, typed in that fable old! TO SIR JOHN HANMER, ON READING HIS SONNETS. Hanmer, a noble name may'st thou make thine— Not with memorial brightness is it bright, But, like the sun, with underivëd light: That, lighting others, in its place doth shine, At distance unapproachable, divine! Thou hast not borrowed feathers to this height To soar: but thine own wing thy lyric flight Has wrought, and, like the lark, thou dost combine The heights and depths of song: now up to heaven Soaring, as if to thee alone 'twere given: Now dropping, vocal, to familiar earth, Joying, in thy descent, thy place of birth! But, oh! thy Pegasus need not be driven, No spur asks so much mettle and real worth! THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY LONDON NEAR AND AT A DISTANCE. When to the great metropolis I come, Somehow or other, the idea so vast Dismembers, and the fragments round are cast At random—the grand, conscious voice seems dumb, Or sinks into a vague, confusëd hum, No more articulate: but like the blast, That o'er a treeless region rushes past, With sound monotonous and wearisome, Wanting that which may give it voice! but when I go back to the quiet streams and woods, And list afar its mighty workings, then Sublime, on me in Nature's solitudes, Those million faces of my fellow-men Look forth as one, aweing my thoughtful moods! Then, too, those million voices, fused and blent, That sounded like the backward-plunging sea, Become articulate and one to me: And, in that meditative pause, are sent Back to my ear, with meaning eloquent. Like one great voice, all sounding in one key, And mighty as God's voice, yea! it is He Who speaks thereby, as from the firmament! And like a magnifying glass Alluding to a well-known effect of the magnifying looking-glass. that vast And multitudinous city doth appear: From which Man's image larger still is cast When further off, and lesser grows when near. Larger, when thus the parts are grandly massed, Then like God's-image seems Man's outline here! ON A PECULIAR EFFECT OF THE SMOKE OVER LONDON, SEEN BY A FROSTY SUNSET. The smoke of the immense metropolis Hangs in the still air like a pillar vast: Such as, when God-warned Israel had past The sea that parted into an abyss, With wavy walls, whose tops did nod to kiss Each other, went with them upon the blast, And round them its protecting shadows cast; Such at a distance seems unto me this! But now the sun has smit it, and it turns To red, and like the pillar of fire burns, That went along with them by night, as did The cloud by day—and now the sun is hid Once more: and naught my wondering eye discerns, Except a huge, memorial pyramid! TO HERODOTUS. Herodotus, old, chatty, neighboursome, And naive companion: of thine antique tale The primitive, rich colors grow not pale Or dim, though of its mythic graces some Time has disproved, and others have become Too simple for an age that holds all stale, Flat, and unprofitable, of no avail, Without immediate uses—yet, though dumb Thy picturesque, old language, long outworn, And spoken now by none of woman born, Thy work, like some naive, early fresco, keeps Its first, quaint charm—its feelings, fresh as morn: Its mythic flowers, whose roots are in the deeps Of Truth: and from which, though they seem t' adorn Alone, deep, inward meanings Wisdom reaps! RESPONSIBILITY OF AUTHORS. With shame and sorrow I my work should see, If aught that I had said or written could Injure Religión or lessen Good— For all, though great as Shakspear a man be, Lie under deep responsibilitie For what they leave on record—if I've woo'd The Truth, and ta'en a vain similitude, Instead, unto my heart, oh, let my plea Be this: that I erred not from want of will To love the Good, but power to part the Ill— Yet let me hope that nothing I have writ May tend to evil; for I but fulfill Truth's own commands, when freely I submit All things to proof, for her own benefit! EXCULPATION OF CHAUCER'S UNIONS OR APPOSITIONS OF MYTHOLOGICAL AND CHRISTIAN IDEAS, SUCH AS THE ANACHRONISM INVOLVED IN MARS BEING CALLED A KNIGHT, AND VENUS A SAINT. The Poet lives not in mere time and space— From that far height where, poised upon his wings Of Past and Future, he surveys all things, And the Before and After doth embrace, The little accidents of time and place, To which the humbler spirit cleaves and clings, Fade from his view, while, like the lark, he sings Far out of sight of earth, and leave no trace! Therefore, high-priest of Art, he oft unites, In bonds of holy wedlock, things remote, Apt marriages of high Truths to promote! And these, which vulgar minds call oversights, Are but the larger views, which, from those heights Of Truth he takes, like God, who all at once doth note! A SUMMER REVÉRIE. My heart is full, and almost sorrowful: For Bliss, o'erleaping its own self, will fall On t'other side—yet is it musical, As though it were a flute, which, with her full, Sweet breath, with many-a tremble, many-a lull Of pausing harmony, Nature doth call Forth into utterance poetical, Likest the nightingale's, high-fanciful And rapturous! this world, so fair and good, Hath quite possessed me: it is in me as Without me—yea, its sweet similitude Is mirrored there, as in a magic-glass: On which I gaze, as on some tranquil flood, Not knowing how the wonder comes to pass! A SUMMER-DAY'S RAMBLE. I went forth with the morning in its prime, To spend, like it, one day of innocent Delight—I went forth to the first, sweet scent Of flowers, to the song of birds, the chime Of matin bells, all making pleasant rhyme With brooks that, vocal, on their missions went: One full, harmonious accompaniment, To thoughts in keeping with the happy time! I came back when the Evening, like a nun, Had drawn her starry veil about her brow, As if the rude World's notice she would shun, And concentrate her whole soul on her vow! And I too felt the holy influence bow My heart, well-pleased to end as I begun! PERSONAL FEELING. A solitary-hearted soul am I, Living in regions of my own apart, Like some lone rock, that from the main doth start On sailors far from land, 'twixt sea and sky, While past me life's deep tides flow changefully! And yet, though standing thus aloof, my heart (Like vessel to some metropolitan mart) Hath brought (and ta'en) full freights of sympathy, To the great markets whither men resort, For free exchange of commerce and of thought! The sea hath been my playfellow: the winds And waters; and, as with congenial minds, I with the Elements converse, for naught But, to my ear, a voice articulate finds! TO THE PSEUDO-GREAT. Great Poet, be not proud of being great— True wisdom still is not more girt about With power than with meekness: and without Is but half-wisdom—for best things still mate Together, and are not found separate! Yet, should'st thou entertain of this a doubt, Thou art not so much greater as to flout And scorn thy fellows of a less estate— And, after all, if we view things aright, The end of all true wisdom's happiness— And they, who this attain with so much less, As well as thee with powers infinite, The end of all thy powers still possess, And find below what thou seek'st on a height! ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REASON IMAGINATIVE AND UNIMAGINATIVE. The poet and philosopher pursue One Truth, but in a different way—the one, By slow induction and comparison Of facts, doth work it out in order due, Link upon link, where if one fails all do— The other, by an intuitión, And an unerring instinct, lights upon The Truth, and, feeling it as Beauty too, Gives it a twofold worth—exuberant His thoughts play out their surplusage in scent And flower, with that feeling consonant, Of Truth and Beauty knit, with one consent, In bonds of holy wedlock, to enchant Man more: and for more full accomplishment! ON THE ADAPTATIONS OF PROVIDENCE. How beautiful are the analogies, The strong similitudes in difference, The wonderful gradations of the immense Design of Nature, throughout earth and skies! One common type, with more or less disguise And variation, yet with consequence Most strict, and wonderful intelligence, Through endless changes we may recognize! Behold this sea-fish, in his element, The fish alluded to is called Stickleback. and is common among the rockpools on the Cornish and Devonshire coast, and is very beautiful, its side-fins being like wings, and the speckled divisions of their membranes like feathers: it is by some called the stinging fish, the prickly ridge on the back causing a stinging pain, when it punctures the skin: this ridge is like a beautiful frill, plaited in folds, each prickle being united to the other by a transparent membrane. The eyes are very prominent, and remarkably beautiful; the outer orb is like a lens of transparent opal, over the pupil, which is dark, but surrounded by a luminous ring like ruby, which, in the sun, gleams with exquisite coruscations, more living than those of the gem. (Expanse as wide as air) as blest and free As any bird—and, as if with intent To draw a parallel between them, see His fins are watery wings designed to be, Like the fern-owl's, with grey and brown besprent! MY MUSE IN HER TEENS. My Muse was flying, in the full-blown pride Of unfledged strength, with half-exerted wing, As if to span Parnassian heights, and sing At elevations where great Homer tried His epic vans, and airs from heaven replied Responsive to each beat, were but a thing Of course, to which she needed but to bring Her easy strength, thus carelessly applied. But, from the cold and windy North, there came A blast of critic breath that beat her back, Far out of sight of her imagined aim. But soon, her wings redressing, she her track Resumed, and, sweeping through the stormy wrack, The hindrance made her triumph, nor her shame! ON SEEING A WHALE ON SHORE. There lies the giant of the deep—the wave, That made him choral music as he went, And, 'neath his huge weight, lightly rose and bent, Each movement seconding, now o'er his grave Rolls out its muffled dirge, and seems to lave, With sympathetic effort and intent, The mighty form, but late its ornament, Of him who of his watery realms doth crave In vain mere space to die in! there's naught lives, But Nature conscious seems of its decease, And, in some sort, a recognition gives! And, so believing, we, at least, increase A wise regard for Life, which still survives, To make us love all things and live at peace! HOW GOD THINKS. This world's the mind of God—throughout all space He lives, and thinks, and operates—there's nought, From greatest unto least, but is a thought Of His: from the least flower, in its grace And beauty, to the sun in his bright place! Those orbs, with which all heaven above is fraught, Are by an act of mere volition brought Forth into being—each with radiant face, As if it smiled again to be so bright, And some with stars around them like a zone! He thinks not as men do: mere thoughts alone, Without effect; he thinks, and, as I write The word, lo! worlds into their place have grown, New satellites to render back his light! CHILDREN'S QUESTIONS. A shrewd child's questions are, in their quaint way, Hardest to answer—they come to the “Why” At once, and will not take, for a reply, Vague explanations which but lead astray— They break through all the cobweb-like array Of words and technicalities, whereby We darken e'en the windows of the sky, And dim the very light of God's free day! But they those lovely windows would fling wide, And, like the flowers, turn still to the light, Which through them streams, from morn till eventide! Nature's the only book which they delight To pore upon: with things, not words, which hide And gloss them over, joying heart and sight! AMBITION. The votary of Ambition climbs the heights Of power, and behind him leaves the flowers Of life, the pleasant pathways, and the bowers Where Love still dallies with his own delights, And with more than he promises requites! He leaves all these for careful-thoughted hours, And his brief pleasures he by force deflours, Not calmly weds! while through his satellites The world receives his light, if he succeeds, And thanks not him—receives it fainter, as Men sunlight through the moon—so doth he pass Onward, and his affections treads, like weeds, Beneath his feet: to find Power but a glass Which shows that still to Vanity all leads! ON SOME FLIES IN THE SUNBEAMS. Each fly, that dances in yon' setting sun, Has got a glory from the plenitude Of light, which it, exhaustless source of good, Not misses, though so much, since he begun His bounteous course, already he hath done! Nature doth nothing from its share exclude Of happiness—in her infinitude Of ways and means, she hath for every one More than enough in its degree and kind— And by that halo she would teach us this: That even so each in itself can find (Of which that but the mere reflection is) An inward light, for guidance, so designed As to make its necessity its bliss! MY OWN EPITAPH. Here lies one who was in his faults a Man, But in his virtues likewise, though but few— Who, while he lived, strove still to keep in view The grand essentials with which he began This life: which God placed first in the great plan; And to which still, if we would judge men true, We must recur: when things that round them grew, Mere parasitic growths, less during than The ivy: accidents of time and place, Have passed away, and left them bare to all The influences which ceaselessly efface Things of a day, to build up on their fall The names which are to leave a lasting trace, And in men's mouths be always musical! TO THE CHARTISTS, UNDER FROST. Deluded Men, who still from want of light, Darkly pursue dark ends, or even good, Turning them thereby to similitude Of worse, in their own better nature's spite— Why do ye yourselves violate the right, Whose violation in your persons would Exasperate ye? giving latitude Of evil, unto those who take delight Therein, by your example—opening thus A door for other ills to creep thereby Into the state—would ye your wrongs discuss Calmly, and knit your minds to unity, Ye would find that your Word unanimous Was mightier than your Hand to rectify! ON A GRECIAN BAS-RELIEF, REPRESENTING A SACRIFICE. Lo! all is ready for the sacrifice! The votive hymn hath but just died away, And Silence, stealing back, with fitful play And fraction, like the pause of waves that rise And fall, with intermittent harmonies, Hovers around the incense, which, with gray And odorous smoke, curls upward to the day, Joying the Gods, with worship, in the skies! Oh odorous incense, thou must still remain In air—oh priest, thy upraised hand must still Be fixed—the victim still remain unslain! And, as I gaze, by mere act of the will, My spirit to old years is rapt again, And Time may go his ways e'en as he will! NATURE'S MUSIC. Hast thou e'er seen a little child, who lays His hand upon a harp, and sweeps the strings? And, thronging 'neath it, come strange answerings, Beyond the power of words to paraphrase: Yearning, as if in pain, from their sweet maze Of vocal sounds and airy wanderings, To disentangle their confusëd wings, And mount to heav'n, each in its proper place, Whilst he amazed doth hear—e'en such am I— For, when I strike the strings of Nature's lyre, I know not half the chords of harmony Which answer: vibrating till they expire Beyond the imagined bounds of earth and sky, Going both deeper and ascending higher! THE POETS' JUDGMENT. Milton and Shakspear, ye unto the bar Are summoned, answer to your mighty names! And, lo! there comes a voice, whose power shames The thunder into silence, sounding far Away—and, with his memory like the star Of morning in its freshness, that proclaims The day afar, lo! Milton comes: true Fame's Acknowledged Son, foremost where so few are Accepted! and he points to things which stand, Enduring as the mountains, to attest The labours of his Thought and of his Hand— Things that, like Holy-writ, make manifest The will of God, and reverence command, Labours, whose close was like God's sabbath-rest! And, lo! a greater voice, upon the ear Of listening nations hushed, in wonder dumb, Like music of the far-off spheres, doth come, And Shakspear next doth at the bar appear: Whom Fame still follows, ever in arrear: And points to things which have increased the sum Of all men's wealth—to thoughts which have become As household words, and, like the daylight, dear! Capacious Soul! he thought it not worth while To mix in politics: but with his pen, As with a lever, moved the world, to smile And weep, and taught his fellows to be men! Well knowing that all differences then, Which Man could not, sure Time would, reconcile! THE DANGER OF ATTEMPTING SUDDENLY TO ROOT OUT NATIONAL PREJUDICES. The lesser accidents of time and place, The old, memorial modes of thinking: all The spider-threads of habit, which, though small, Bind us insensibly, and our free pace Break to the hackneyed step, devoid of grace As freedom, into which the world doth fall, That ass, which runs one round perpetual, With pack upon its back, and formal face! All these, as Samson his green wythés, I Have rent in twain with ease—but some there are, Deep prejudices, stronger, wider, far— And they who would pluck up these suddenly, As Samson did the temple-pillar, by Their fall must fall, with those 'gainst whom they war! BY THE SEA-SHORE. Here sit I, like some God of the old prime, Just wakened into divine consciousness: Like Neptune, when his great hand did caress The Ocean's mane first, at the dawn of Time, Ere his dread name had passed into a rhyme! Here sit I, while the sea, with wavy stress And emphasis, and utterance nothing less Than epic, lends a voice to thoughts sublime! Here sit I, musing upon things to come, Beyond all reach of mortal eloquence; Till, unto that which had but struck me dumb, The great Sea, giving articulate sound and sense, Sublimes the mighty but confusëd hum Into a voice as of Omnipotence! MY MUSE. My Muse, they say, has not succeeded yet In marrying her thoughts to verse divine, But that the outward and the visible sign Of consummation, which a seal should set To the sweet union, and one beget Of two, is wanting—p'rhaps some may incline To think the bans of wedlock, which confine Desire, and the fees, a sacred debt To Mother-church, have not been duly paid And published; or the marriage-rite not read In place quite orthodox, by priest arrayed In robes canonical—but if the head And front of my offending this be made, Know, Nature read the bans, and God the blessing said! Oh yes, my dearest Muse, we were not wed In place unsanctioned—no unblessed hand Between us knit the holy marriage-band: Or made it vain with mumbled forms and dead, And hireling-fees, to Mammon duly paid! We had a living blessing at command, And in the presence of our God did stand, Who from the holy book of nature read The nuptial rite—and on thee, then my bride, Spring waited, as thy bridesmaid, not so fair As thou, disparaged at thy lovelier side! The Graces tended thee, with all the pride Of Love, and thou didst from the temple bear Blessings and costly presents, from all there! TO MY COUNTRYMEN. My countrymen, from many a venal pen We've read your catalogue of ill, eked out With feignëd faults, and virtues called in doubt— But I am proud to call ye countrymen, Laborious, thoughtful, brave, with sober ken Fixed ever on life's solid goods: devout, And reverencing the laws, e'en when without Full sanction, for the good they cause e'en then, The love of peace, the greatest good of all, Without which to the ground the rest must fall, Like fruit plucked ere it ripens—then my dear, Dear countrymen, do ye but persevere, And that same love of peace shall on ye call Down far more blessings than all in arrear! THE HEART'S PLACES OF WORSHIP. How many shrines, for its affections there To dwell, as in a temple, can the heart Of Man for itself make, with little art, E'en of the simplest things! how passing-fair Seem to us all the spots, so cherished, where We passed our boyish days: ere sorrow's smart Had touched, or we had bartered, in life's mart, Our heart's affections for a paltry share Of the world's gold or favour—e'en the stone We sat on by the streamside, in our bliss Far richer than we since through gold have grown, Seems to us, in our inmost hearts all this Revolving, far, far better than a throne, Whose feet, not innocent brooks, but false lips kiss! ON AN OLD AND DIRTY COPY OF SHAKSPEAR. There lies a little book much soiled and worn: Yet hath it charms and spells potential— It, from the depths of human Thought, can call Forth answers: it hath treasures like the Morn, Gladness, and songs, and light, and souls forlorn Can cheer, with touches sweet and musical— And ready sympathy it hath for all, At all times: none doth it deny or scorn! And many-a sublime brow hath o'er it bent, With spiritual crown by hands not made, Anointed to some great accomplishment With chrism upon royal heads not laid: To some great, corresponding argument Singing “with voice memorial in the shade!” ON THE NEGLECT OF NATIONAL EDUCATION. Where, in this darkness, is the master-mind To say, “let there be light:” to call forth day And intellectual light, the fair array Of peace and order, from this chaos blind Of moral elements? in which confined, Unquickened, all the germs of life decay, Or work for ill: wanting the divine ray Of knowledge, which has left the mass behind Inert—alas! we have gone on too far, And pérfected mechanics but not men: Machines, neglecting Man, for whom they are. So hath the stream of life become a fen Of stagnant waters, tainting all the air, Yet they who breathe it know it not e'en then! TO ? AFTER ABSENCE. No line of favour, which adorned thee then, Hath Time yet blurr'd—the snatches of thy voice, Likest the nightingale's, as erst rejoice The listener's ear, and, as thou passest, men Stand still at gaze, and keep thee in their ken, As they had seen a vision—the alloys, Which Love, to temper his delights, employs, And suit them to earth's duller denizen, Thou hast not felt, thou angel without wings, To whom the heaven thou hast left still clings! The freshness of the morning lingers round Thee still: oh thou art like the star that brings In morn and eve, and both their charms are found In thee, lightheartedness with thought profound! ON THE AUTOMATIC TENDENCIES OF MACHINERY. I would give all I have to see Mankind What I would wish them—when each Man, each day, From pleasure, not constraint, and health his pay, Shall labour just so much as God designed For needful unto strength of limb and mind— And then, in human converse, holy play With children, the glad hours to wile away, To play them out, and make them leave behind Sweetness, like music! and all this shall come To pass—for this God placed at Man's command Nature and all her wonders—not for some, But all—that, in due time, the meanest hand Might call forth harmonies which now are dumb, And from a mightier lyre than Homer spanned! NEGLECT OF POETRY. On evil days I've fallen: not like him, Who brushed with his archangel-like strong wing The throne of God, and did His missioning, Already numbered of the Seraphim— Who, darkling, like the Night, did yet, though dim, Like her, celestial dews in darkness fling From his enriching wings, and heavenward sing, Towards the light, and, larklike, towards it climb! But yet on evil days I've fallen: days In which the Muse can find no audience, But by the wayside sits, by her own bays O'ershadowed, and concealed from vulgar sense. So be it; yet she taketh not offence, But makes her “sunshine in a shady place!” ON HEARING SOME SINGING BY NIGHT. Whence comes that music, with its dying fall, Which steals upon the dark, and so doth take The Air, that it hangs tranced on its sweet wake? And then from death to life doth straight recall Itself, with resurrection musical Beyond its death: as though 't would overtake That dying close, ere, melting like a flake Of snow, its súrcease caused an interval! The mute air trembles with its ravishment, Which hangs upon the darkness, like the scent Of flowers from an arbour-roof down-weighed: While Rapture, fearing to give himself vent, Pores, like a lover, on the dark, afraid To speak, lest one dear sound unheard should fade! UTILITY. Thou ask'st me, of what use is all this care For one poor flower, which will bloom and die, And nothing leave behind it when gone by! O Friend, thou tak'st a mean view of what are The ends of life, and little too dost bear In mind the uses of Humanity: For which all else hath its utility, Useful but as with this great end they square! Through this one flower, fleeting as it is, I gain the feeling of the Beautiful; And whosoever hath not gainëd this, Hath missed one end of Life: and doth annul One fairest page in Nature's book, and miss Its meaning, and but half Life's flowers cull! TO ? [Dear eyes of blue, like the Forgetmenot] Dear eyes of blue, like the Forgetmenot, Remembrancer of things too dear to name: Whose touching, mute appeals put to mere shame The eloquence of language; one glance shot From your blue depths may never be forgot, But haunts us ever, thrilling through the frame, With love's soft, inextinguishable flame, By those sweet eyes, as at the stars, begot! Twin stars ye are of Hope and Memory Yourselves: or like the star of morn and eve, Which doth perform a twofold ministry— For, while memorial glances we perceive, Touching and sad: gleams of futurity Ye shoot, which tracks of light behind them leave! A SUNSET THOUGHT, AT HAMPTON COURT. Those clouds, that, gilded by the setting sun, Above the towers of Hampton-palace rest, And all the airy outline soft invest With richest folds of golden tissue spun, In the loom of the elements, which none Could equal, though wrought for a monarch's vest: With trails of glory hang upon the west, As on the day when Wolsey's race was run! They look like robes of State, late thrown aside, By some great soul retired from the scene Of all its majesty and full-blown pride, To witness for the splendors that have been. But he, whose spirit did o'er all preside, Who wore them, though still felt, is no more seen! THE GOOD AND EVIL OF LIFE. The sorrows of this life, the bitterness, The evils, social or inherited, Transmitted to the living by the dead, Who thus still live, with power to curse or bless, As chanced their errors to be more or less: That bitterness the wise man turns instead Into the leaven of life's daily bread, To raise it, so that naught be in excess— So wisely blends he the ingredients; And, if somewhiles the taste seem bitter, he Thereby the after-zest but more augments, And gives to happiness varietie. The mixture but proportions the contents: The whole is sweet, though bitter the leaven be! ON A CANKERED BRANCH. What dost thou there, cumbering that goodly tree, Unsightly branch, that not fulfill'st thine end: That bear'st nor leaf nor flower, nor dost lend Beauty nor use, where both should native be? Alas! in life how many are like thee: Who what they were made for nor comprehend Nor care: who die alive, and break and bend, Cumbering the fair tree of Humanitie! Who have so little hold on the main stem, That they receive no sap from it, nor yet Contribute unto it, nor it to them— Who yet high up above the rest are set, And all the goodly boughs beneath contemn, That nourish it, and bear their useless weight! ON BURNS, THE POET AND EXCISEMAN. Ye gave him, when he asked for bread, a stone: And, when he asked for love, indifference: And, when for recognition, insolence And cold denial: till his fame had grown His justification—when, to atone Too late for all these wrongs, and show your sense Of worth, ye gave him a few pounds and pence, Still measuring his merits by your own. O Nation, that hast set thy heart on gold, And “Useful” deem'st but what subserves thereto, Thou gain'dst so an exciseman, and didst hold It gain, although it cost a poet true; So didst thou make him “useful” in the old, False ways, whom God had sent to teach thee new! HUMAN DEPRAVITY. O God, in spite of all my charity, My hope and faith, I'm well nigh sick at heart Sometimes, when I behold the worser part Of human Nature, scanned too narrowly: Viewed with that microscopic scrutiny, Which, through all cloaks of nature or of art, Looks straight to the sad truth, that, like a dart, Goes through the heart of my Humanity. The want of honor, the ingratitude, The vice, the brutish ignorance, of some, The imperfections of both bad and good, Dishearten, and, at times, my Muse strike dumb: Make me ashamed of Man's similitude, And wish, sometimes, I could aught else become. SECOND-THOUGHTS ON THE ABOVE. It is the hardest task, the highest end, Of all true wisdom, rightly understood, To see the Ill, yet not o'erlook the Good: Nor let the Ill beyond itself extend, Nor o'er the sunny side its shadow send, Beyond its own intrinsic magnitude; As mountains cast their shadows far, and brood At distance, and their own real bulk transcend. 'Tis hard to school the heart to be, in spite Of injury and envy, generous still: In seeing Good alone to take delight, And to forget, or to forgive, the Ill— And he, who can do this, has still a right To think godlike of Man, and must and will! THE CORRESPONDENCIES OF NATURE WITH MAN. The rose, the type of beauty, and the bay, That shades the poet's brows: the cypress-wreath, Sepulchral ornament of solemn Death: The sweet Forgetmenot, which links To-day With Yesterday, reminder on life's way: And many more beside, which I want breath And rhyme to tell, are emblems all beneath The sun of Man, his life and his decay— Hidden analogies there are beside These obvious ones: and Nature, though she feel No grief herself, doth flatter yet Man's pride With show of sympathy, his griefs to heal. In spring she greets him like a blooming bride, And winter to his age makes mute appeal! Echos she has for almost every tone Of feeling, changes too for every mood: And pulses in her heart, scarce understood, Responsive truly yet unto our own; Yearnings, in her mute fashion, and unknown Presentiments: rejoicings over Good, Sorrowings for Evil, with similitude Of human life in thousand fashions shown. And is all this by chance? or, rather, was Not Nature made to hold to Man her glass, To show him his true image, that his soul Might love and sympathize with this vast Whole? That its true meaning into him might pass, And all be clear, the journey and the goal. Ere steam was yet discovered, Man nor knew Nor dreamt of half that Science had in store: Yet Nature all those powers, and far more, Contained, and still continues so to do; And, day by day, she labours, with a view To his real happiness, with gentle lore, To draw his notice, further to explore, As in a child's hand mothers put the clue! She dropped the apple in a Newton's sight, As 't were a plaything for her grown-up child, At whose first essays (essays infinite To Man) she, in her wisdom, only smiled! And so she leads Man on, from height to height, To nearer view of God, to fuller light! And yet she with the least, least child will play, And fill her lap with daisies for him still, And sing him lullabies with bird and rill, And, like a mother, never from him stray, But still prepare fresh pleasures by the way, And wisdom, lovingly, each step instill Into his little heart, and school his will, Until her wise instructions men gainsay. All this she does, and how much more than this! How gently doth she wean Man from the Wrong! She sends the bird to sing him his sweet song, The flower to blossom, the child's smile and kiss, “Forgetmenots,” still as he goes along, To teach him that his “Gold” is not Man's bliss! O holy Nature, pardon, then, if I In vain thy name have taken, when I call These poor “attempts,” with right equivocal, “Touches Alluding to the title of a volume of my Poems, called, “Touches on the Harp of Nature.” on thy great harp:” whose strings are, sky, Earth, ocean, víbrating eternally: And hearts unnumbered, making musical Accord therewith, down to the least of all, In the great concert of Humanity! Pardon me, for I am but as a child, That has ta'en up a flute by accident, And with a passing note or two beguiled His little hour—then laid the instrument Aside, and, as its echos faded, smiled, In wonder at his own experiment! I am, indeed, but as a little child, Who, in the grass, has filled his lap brimfull, With all the flowers he had time to pull— And, ere yet to the wonder reconciled, With which he on the daisy looked and smiled, For the first time, by his so bountiful, Great “Father,” who permitted him to cull Those flowers, which his little hour beguiled, Unto some other task is called away! Alas! of all this lovely world how small A part we know! yet e'en one summer's day, With opening flower, and song of bird, and fall Of shadowy eve, can fill the heart! and, pray, If that be full, what wants it after all? The music of the days which are to come Doth haunt me ever, and my footsteps move In time unto it—paces of deep love And faith unchangeable! I hear the hum Of mighty workings, and cannot be dumb— To the grand concert of the spheres above Mankind moves on, vain omens to disprove: While, overhead and in the vanward, some Prophetic soul, larklike, doth soar and sing— A few, poor snatches of that music here, My fellow-men, I, as a pledge, would bring— The music at my heart, still answering clear: Which tells me that there must be yet some string Untouched, that God intended Man to hear! End of the Sonnets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. SEEMING-POOR. Why poor? tho' coarsely clothed his body be, His food the commonest that earth supplies, Yet, scanty as it is, his luxuries Are neither few nor small—content is he, Therefore he has an ample sovereignty: A King, (without a King's infirmities) A child, strange contraries! in him agree; He too, a true philosopher, is wise In that profoundest of all mysteries, Calm self-enjoyment: in his thoughts he's free, As a bird i' the air, from life's vain woes. Looking on earthly gains as passing shows, He hath a quiet smile for such as mourn For pleasures which, at latest, at life's close Must be resigned—for which we oft expose Life, and life's Life—which, in our funeral urn, Leave but a few, dead ashes, and soon burn To their first dust! a higher bourne he seeks, And a warm welcome long before bespeaks: Nor unprovided on his journey goes: For in small space lies all Man needs and knows! He has sought nothing but himself, thus he Cannot lose what he is, for that he still must be! OVER SHARP-SIGHTEDNESS. Oh! woe unto the man, whose keener eye Hath looked too deep beneath the surface: who Will not take forms for things, nor false for true, Nor ape and farce it, like the rest, nor buy, By idol-worship, like security From persecution; he will live to rue That he had eyes among the blind, and knew Too much to be a dupe; what misery Can equal that man's, who finds nothing here To fill his heart: who yearns for something more Than this life offers? he has bought too dear His knowledge, and has looked at things too near: And thenceforth seeks in vain the golden lore, The Alchymy, life's lost charm to restore! SECOND-THOUGHTS ON THE ABOVE. Pardon, great God! most idly was it said: 'Twas in a fit of sadness, and mine eye Was filmed: but now the dark cloud has pass'd by, Without a trace, save shame at being led To speak such foolish thoughts as those it bred! Earth laughs before my feet (tho' I've reviled It so, and Thee in it) as Thou hadst smiled Forgiveness on me thus! and heaven is spread, In all its boundlessness, above my head: And, 'neath the bright, blue dome, I kneel for thy Forgiveness, for the thought was blasphemy. But now, like yon dim cloudlet, it has fled, And left me, like the heavens, full of light, Thy light, by which again I see aright. And could I say that I had looked too close At things, when, at my feet, the flower blows, And the child plays, and on the bough the bird Sings his heart out, despite that foolish word: Not caring whether or how close I look, For not by rote has he learnt from a book His song, altho' by heart: nor doth he miss A single note, so perfect in his bliss! But I had not looked close enough, else had I seen more of the Good, less of the Bad; Aye, even there where social man is pent In cities, and hath scant accomplishment. Had I looked closer I had yet found Good E'en in ill things, or some similitude Thereof, some homage meant it even then, When most mistaken, by well-meaning men! Had I looked closer still, I should have seen God's image on the coin, where it had been Most chafed, yea! even where effaced, some sign Whereby to recognize the hand divine! Or could I say, “that there was nothing here To fill the heart” when even now the tear, From thoughts unutterable, dims my sight; When it is so, so full, that but to hear The bird's least note makes it gush over quite! When but a daisy fills it with delight! And canst thou not, vain mortal, find out aught To fill thy heart? is it so great then, so Capacious, that the godliest feeling, though Love itself, is but as a drop, as naught Therein? can that which fills God's own heart, yea! To overflowing, not fill thine, I say? Is not the rose-bud full of its own scent? Is not the vine with its own clusters bent? Is not the bird full of his song too—is His song not full of love, his love of bliss, His bliss of heaven, and heaven itself of this? And canst thou then not fill thy human heart With human feelings? then, I say, thou art Not yet a Man! and can the Godlike, can The thought of God, whose overflowing love Stoops from emblazoning the clouds above, To streak the daisy with the selfsame hue That crimsons them, not fill the heart of man? Oh fool! then for the flower one drop of dew, One carol for the bird: one little view Of his dear master to the faithful hound, One word of love, nay, of his voice the sound, Does more than all the Godlike does for thee, Which for preeminence thou mak'st thy plea, Which is thy Being, or, at least, should be, If thou wert truly, or could'st well expound Thy Being's purport! and if this life gives Full scope unto the Godlike, Fair, and True, What matters it then where or how one lives, More than to live godlike can no one do! ON HEARING AN OLD SONG PLAYED BY A YOUNG LADY. Touch me those notes again, That old, familiar song, Those chords of mingled joy and pain, Remembered, though not heard, so long! Touch me those notes once more, And so transport me back To when I heard them first of yore, Although it stretch me on the rack! With chords melodious, On Music's rack fast bind This heart, which torture feels, while thus Anguish and bliss are intertwined! My heart-strings are the strings, My heart th'invisible lyre, On which thou play'st memorial things, Kindling it with a touch of fire. It seems her very hand, The touch of her I loved, Which had all music at command, And all it touched still more improved. That hand is cold and dead, That lyre too, my heart, Which it to themes divine had wed, Unstrung, and, tuneless, set apart. Its chords are loosed, and sighs, As o'er a waste the wind, Make on them funeral-melodies, With pause, like death itself, behind! Else, haply, now 't would play Things worthier of the theme, Sweet music, sounding far away, Into the realms of bliss supreme! And there be heard by her, And, if her gentle heart Of Mortal things feel there the stir, Memorial yearnings might impart. But she feels grief no more, An angel ministrant Of Mercy now, she doth explore The realms of bliss, and pardon grant! There comes a rush of thought, That like a torrent sweeps, And, with the Present's traces fraught, Loses itself in unknown deeps! Or like a rushing wind, That bends the highest trees, Leaving their proud tops bowed behind, Quivering long after it doth cease! Rapt on the wings of song, My soul is borne away, With wake as musical and long, As doth the upward lark betray! Lost to the present all, And singing out of sight, Yet heard, with voice memorial, And made by distance exquisite! Far in the golden Past, The dawning of old days, Rerisen on the overcast And sombre noon of my life's race. Touch me those chords again, By which the very soul Of music, exquisite to pain, Is brought at once beneath controul! Touch me those chords once more, Whose wonder-working art Can make the heart's old founts to pour, And, in the waste, afresh to start! Touch me those strings divine, And let me triumph so O'er Time, for though the hand be thine, To her I still the music owe! 'Tis she who gives it all, The charm which doth abide, Who makes it more than musical For me, and none, none, none beside! Pardon me what I say: Not to disparage thee 'Tis said—but Love will have his way, And thou, though more, could'st not be she! To thee this withered rose Is but a faded flower, To me with spring and youth it glows, With spells of beauty and of power! Yet let me thank the hand Which waked those chords again, E'en though it may not understand The secret of their joy or pain! Though, ignorant, it enrich Those chords with heavenlier strains Than chords ere made, save those on which Love plays his dívine joys and pains! To me it is as though Some angel, in the clouds, Had touched a lyre divine, below Heard but by one of all earth's crowds! ON FANCY-DREAMERS, WHO THINK REAL LIFE TOO COMMONPLACE FOR THEM. What would'st thou breathe, if not this common air! Art thou then so uncommon good and great, That common things thou canst not tolerate! Yet, wert thou so, 'twere but a reason fair, Why thou should'st be still more considerate— Is it not Ether, common as it is? Or, at the least, may be made so for his Wise service, who doth breathe it not in hate And scorn, but love to all men, which makes bliss Divine, and airs from heav'n with it doth bear, To witness for it! are thy fellow-men Not with thee here as Angels, or what are To be such, therefore godlike? what more then Canst thou require? thou dost thyself create The “Commonplace”—but in thyself—not there Where thou believ'st it—strive to elevate Thy view of life: view Man as if he were All that is godlike! and let all who bear That name be holy to thee: if Man's state Thou'dst raise, and thyself with it—yea! e'en when 'Tis but a Beggar, give him back again His greeting in all love and awe, nor dare To think the least ill thought of him when gone: But, for Christ's sake, and for thine own, forbear. Make no invidious comparison: But welcome even him as a coheir Of immortality, and speed him on! And then, the more, more sober-mindedly, More wide awake, uninterruptedly, Thou breath'st this air, which makes us Men alone, And gives to mind and body health and tone, As simply what it is: the deeper thy Belief that all are godlike, from thine own Heart feeling it: which first must make it known, And possible: the more reality Thou giv'st this truth in act, unshaken by Vain doubts and fancies, then wilt thou have grown By so much more an Angel, an ally And minister of heaven, that thine eye In all, who meet thee 'neath the holy sun, Will see nought but the Angel—yea! not one Wilt thou then, as a common Being, try Beneath thee to degrade—as tho' upon His head an halo shone forth visibly, To vindicate, in him, Humanity, Wilt thou respect him then—wilt see, anon, That fancy's dreams were but a gilded Lie, That Truth is, at once, Fact and Poetry, And that this common Air, which we live on, Is the pure Ether of God's blessed sky! THE UPRIGHT MAN. The upright Man, he goes his way, He holds his God-marked brow erect, His whereabouts are like the day, Suspecting none, none him suspect. He wears his heart upon his sleeve, Though spiteful daws may peck at will, And, though his fellow-men aggrieve, His heart of good they cannot kill. He loves and pities them, in spite Of all the ill they cause him too, Their loss, he knows, is infinite, Better to suffer wrong than do! He scorns to hide his thoughts, for 'tis His glory to be free at heart, And, if his tongue were tied, he'd miss His freedom, or its better part. He scorns to do too i' the dark, What he should do in all men's sight, This is of Freedom the true ark, The real Palladium of Right. He sees not in a ballot box The hope and freedom of a state, But in Truth, Peace, and Justice, rocks, Pillars, on which to lean its weight. He does as he would be done by, And covets not another's good, But with it gladdens heart and eye, And would increase it if he could. He does increase it truly too, And swells the general sum of bliss, As through the moon, though hid from view By other worlds, the sun lights this! He yields obedience e'en where The law is not as it should be, For violence doth Peace impair, Who brings, at last, all to agree. Yet must he speak against the wrong, Aye, though he suffer, he must speak, For Truth is stronger than the strong, And mightiest often in the weak. And thoughts, high thoughts, like angels are, And work unseen their work of grace, Carrying their ministries afar, When nearer home they leave no trace! And oft, when fall'n on evil days, Freedom awhile seems lost to Man, One witness may again upraise, And many end what one began. He labours not for some poor end, In darkling mole-ways of his own, But with Mankind doth onward wend, And his Good doth to its postpone. Or, rather, they have one same Good, And that which makes Mankind more wise And happy, doth the one include, And all his blessings multiplies. He would take shame to think, that he The labours of Man's hand and thought So largely shared, without a plea, Contributing thereunto nought. Past ages both and present make The goodly sum of each Man's bliss, And he, who adds most, more doth take, And little truly can call his! A Nation builds him palaces, With Art and Nature's wonders filled, And bridges, as he goes, his ways Prepare, just where he would have willed! And vessels wait, to bear him o'er The sea, as made for him alone, He steps on board, and thinks no more About it, till his voyage is done! Sages, for him, great Nature's laws Explore, and bring her to the light, He may know all that is or was, A Being all-but infinite! For him the greatest poets sing, As if they sang for him alone, And music from the heavens bring, For every fireside some tone! Ungrateful were he then indeed, If deeply he took not to heart The weal of Man, and bade God-speed To all, and took in all a part. So goes the upright Man his way, One with mankind, not of a sect, His goings open as the day, His actions, like the light, direct! ALL THINGS A HYMN TO GOD. Hear'st thou the Hymn? from star to star it flows, Like the deep sound of many waters: on, For ever on, through boundless space—not one Sole thing but duly pays the debt it owes, With praise, according to its kind! the Rose— Whose scent and beauty are its hymn! the sun— Who with each dawn, and when his course is run, Sets forth, with colours fairer far than those Of Raphael, on the clouds that bar his way, His Maker's glory: and, as from the sky They melt, with silent music for the eye, They hymn His praise! and, though there neither may Be speech nor language, they have still whereby To praise him, night by night, and day by day! Then comes the Night, with all her stars, to pay Her homage, with her thousand stars, that ply Stilly their tasks, and utter best thereby His praises, who, in all this rich array Of earth and heavën, seeks not to display Himself, e'en for a moment: éxcept when He smiles down on the sleeping Earth, through ten Times ten ten-thousand stars, when none is nigh To see Him do it—then he smiles—yes then! To think He watches o'er the sons of men So lovingly, through those still stars, and yet Is never seen by those who oft forget His name, and most through that which should but more Make them remember it, and more adore, Were 't but for this! Then thou, my soul, too play Thy part: and, under his Name, modestly Work out the godlike, like the stars, nor pray For vain reward or recompense: for by Becoming godlike will thou best repay At once thyself, and serve the Deity! The rose is quite a rose, and what that can Accomplish, canst not thou? be quite a man! Then will thy being, like the rose's, be A Hymn, and godlike wilt thou live and die: Fit, like its scent, to mix with Ether, high Above earth's mists, and clear, as is the sky, And to all heaven's privileges free As Angels, yea! an Angel verily! ON ONE “LOVED NOT WISELY, BUT TOO WELL.” Oh! would that I had never seen, Or seen thee in a different guise, Then might the love I feel have been A bliss, and not a sacrifice. Alas! and must it then be so, That all I dreamt I find in thee, Find but to lose, and henceforth know, That all is still a dream to me? And yet no longer even that— For, oh! I now can dream no more, Still must I think of thee, and at The thought both dream and truth deplore! When first I saw thee, like a star, I could have knelt and worshipp'd thee, Gazed on thy brightness from afar, Too blessed but in its reach to be! But now I turn my head away, Whilst tears unbidden fill mine eyes, To think that star should go astray, From its bright pathway in the skies. That star, which, in approachless light, Should have shed beauty on the earth, Has set to me, ere well in sight, And scarce I trace its place of birth! Yet will I hope that it is but A cloud which hides it from my view, And that, though for a moment shut From sight, its inward light burns true, I could have loved thee as few love! And oh! I love, will love, thee yet— Yet still, O grief all griefs above, Where most I love, I should forget! TO ONE NOT FORGOTTEN. 'Tis not alone thy lovely face That charms, though fair it be, As a May-morning in the grace Of its first witcherie. 'Tis not alone thy form divine, That like the lily bends, So stately, yet so feminine, Where love with reverence blends! 'Tis not thy lips, on which a smile, E'en when they're motionless, Still dwells, as if to reconcile Mirth with deep thoughtfulness. 'Tis not thy cheek, on which the hues Of morn and evening meet, The freshness of the first, the dews Which make the last so sweet; The softened light which hallows all, Chastening the garishness Of day—the tender gleams which fall— The shadows numberless— It is thine eye, which like the star Of evening, promise gives, Of home, and all home's joys—joys far Beyond Kings' prerogatives! It is thy smile, which comes and goes: Thy soul, which outwardly O'er its fair dwelling-place thus throws Its own divinity— As if on that sweet face were writ, In characters of light, How in that goodly mansion it Found all things requisite! Thoughts that can upward soar, and tears For thoughts too deep for words: And smiles, like those the young Spring wears, And music like the bird's! Simplicity to clothe it, as The angels are with light, And Truth, the spirit's looking-glass, Kept evermore in sight; 'Tis this—'tis these—the nameless grace, Which through each look doth thrill, That claim for thee an angel's place, Yet leave thee woman still. Yet they're but names for one same thing: Or, if a difference be, 'Tis that thou want'st the angel's wing, For true love cannot flee! AGAINST NARROW-MINDED SCEPTICISM. There is a backwardness and cold distrust Of Doubt, which wants the common medium And faculty for comprehending truth; For the worst blind are, those who will not see, And these not even Christ himself could cure: While some, by wish to find the truth, endowed With faith in that same truth, from love thereof Draw an heart-felt conviction, far beyond The subtlest and most logical result Of cold, distrustful reason: scarce convinced In self-despite: his pride reluctantly Yielding a forced assent, that never bears The good fruit grafted on the heart's belief: Which, from the Vital, is itself so too— And Faith and Reason, though they seem to go To divers points of the circumference, Meet in one centre, which doth reconcile Them both: and whence the circle, truly drawn, Touches th' extremes of both, and joins in one. And Reason's compass, to the utmost stretched, With Faith runs even: for beyond that point Where Reason works, God himself never steps! Therefore God rather by the babe's mouth speaks, By the simplicity of ignorance, Than by the proud philosopher's vain lip, The wisdom of the flesh, which needs must prove That God exists; as if to feel him, and, By feeling him, to be godlike, that is To be himself in us, were not the best Of proofs! which, not content to feel him so, So grandly in the heart, nor capable Of thinking great enough to feel him there, Sublimely, palpably, must needs reduce That godlike consciousness of him into A Syllogism, into terms precise, “Major and minor,” and that too instead Of the grand primal argument of all, The heart, the sublime Syllogism, which He himself framed to hold the living proof; Mightiest philosopher! how unlike those Who in their reasonings forget Him, who Is the First Cause: the one grand “Major term,” Without which there is neither reasoning, Nor sense, nor truth! men who would shut God up In verbal definitions, as if He Were but a problem for philosophers To calculate or square; the while He is A circle, which the straight lines of their wit Scarce touch on one least point, and then run off, And lose themselves in His infinity, Poor shooting stars! but these would mystify His simple Word: so simple, because it Is so, so true: so grand, because it is So simple, that a little child needs but A heart to comprehend it, needs but do His Word to prove it! yea! they mystify His sublime Word, because they have not learnt To think yet grand enough of Him, nor yet To comprehend his works; that they may have Wherewith to exercise their wit and skill Of fence, their tricks and sleights of intellect, Their quips and quibbles, and perplex the mind With vain, unprofitable doubts, on points To disputation indispensible, As to salvation needless: for that lies In being godlike, and in doing it; And, if we feel ourselves godlike, need we Thy Syllogisms then to tell us that We are so, or to make our feelings real? The tear within the eye, the swelling heart, These are our proofs, and others need we none! Then keep your Syllogisms, keep them for Your Humes and Gibbons! men of the long head, But narrow heart, who saw but half the truth, And took the lesser half, which they alone Beheld, to be the whole—short-sighted men! Who saw but the half-moon, and thought it ne'er Could be at full—meanwhile, the moon it grew, In spite of them, and their dull arguments, And gathered light, from its far hidden source, And filled the heav'ns and earth, so godlike still; And shone upon the nations, who, by doubt Still unperplexed, upon their sublime way, Untroubled, had moved on, towards God, and all Things worthy of that God, and o'er the graves Of these same wilful men, dispersing there The darkness which themselves had sought to make! These are the genuine Atheists, who, while Acknowledging a God, do all they can To neutralize their own acknowledgment; Who make not godlike truths from that belief To flow, as water from the living well, But, having found the water, shut it up: Who trammel up the consequence, and God Admitting, by the admission God destroy To all intents and purposes—who stand Still doubting of all things, and nothing do, Nothing affirm: but, weighing in their scales God and the World, let neither of the two Preponderate, and so reduce them both To nothing, for to act man must affirm— And to act godlike, must believe in God, Believe that hè the Godlike is and does! Then keep your syllogisms, keep them for Such men as these are! who, when they have proved With these all that they can, have proved alone That they felt not the Godlike, God! that he Existed not to them; else would their lips Have glowed, and bosoms kindled at his name, As mine do even now, though far beneath Them in vain intellect! but that is no, No reason under heaven why we should Not feel him living-most, in our own hearts, For, if we feel him, then is he quite near, Yea! in us! should God for such reasons not Exist to us? because he has not yet Been into mood and figure brought, by rule Exact of Logic, into major Term And minor, as 'tis set down in the book, And well approved! or should the thought of him, For this, be less to us, whom he has made To think and do the Godlike, than unto The flower of the field: which, knowing nought Of Gibbons and of Humes, fulfills, in its Own silent wise, a godlike mission too, Untroubled by the shadow of a doubt? Then leave us but our feelings and the God Within our breasts, we ask no more than this, And, with this, there is nought, methinks, to ask! This is the godlike way of proving God! Then let all prove him so; yea! let all be Godlike in thought and deed: for so long as They are godlike, they must believe in him, To be so, for without Him they are not! EVENING THOUGHTS, WRITTEN NEAR GENEVA, BY THE RHONE. JULY, 1833. Not one least leaf is stirring: in the sky Yon lazy-flakëd clouds hang stilly, where The wind first wafted them, as if the air, With its last breathings, faint and sleepily, Had urged them thither—softly tinted by The sinking sun, their edges glow, like gold That, unconsuming, melts—those mountains old, Which, but a moment past, seemed pale and cold, Like giant spectres, fixed with stony stare, Steeped in the crimson splendor, red-hot burn, Like antediluvian ashes in the urn Of some old, fire-wasted world! and, lo! One after one, they pale—their tops of snow Piercing the heavens, sharp and frostily, As if their molten summits, suddenly, Had from intensest Cold, at fiercest glow, Congealed to giant icicles—such as At each pole hang, and in whose icy glass Eternal Frost stares fixedly! yet there Still linger the rich colors of the sky, Beneath, by which those old trees, that upbear, Column-like, their leafy masses, and which were Erewhile in shade, are steeped, so lovelily, In crimson tints, which kindle now, now die, And fade and change, and mingle in supreme And endless loveliness, dazzling the eye With beauty, while the waters through them gleam And kindle, and with liquid gold flow by, Gilding the cloddy bank, so fairily, Beneath them: and soft mists begin to rise Around their stems, like veils of many dyes, Silver and gold: and, quiet as a dream, This soft work of enchantment mirrored lies, In the broad surface of yon' slumbering stream! No longer know I where I am, mine eyes Swim with delight: I myself feel and seem Dissolved into the elements, a beam Of purple sun-light, blent with this fair Whole. Oh that I might be ever thus: my soul Like yon' calm stream: the mirror in my breast Giving the semblance of its inward rest To all reflected in it, and seen through Its mediúm, from its true point of view: E'en to the troubled and the fleeting forms Without, life's passing clouds and sudden storms! Until this rude, hard world, there in its true Intent reflected, should show fair as do The clouds and landscape in this water here! Which shows all as it is, and yet more clear, Soft, and transparent, with a magic hue, Which its own depth and crystal pureness gives! So too, in thy soul's depth and purity, May be reflected truly all that lives, Like the reflection of yon' quiet sky! And, even when more dark and troublous forms Cast their deep shadows on it, though they be Gloomy without, and there foretell of storms, Yet their reflection, by the light in thee Transparent made, enables thee to see, Through them, the calm and cloudless sky behind, Abiding: when the eye of Day seems blind With sudden fury, and its light is drear: And men awhile, thereat, lose heart and cheer! And, though the storm should burst without, that is No reason why it should disturb thy bliss; Without, it is a storm, but in thy mind A calm reflection only: and who e'er Was by a picture really moved to fear? ON AN UNDECYPHERED ETRUSCAN URN, WITH AN INSCRIPTION. Best Secretkeeper! ages whispered thee Some mighty truth, and to thy silent care Entrusted it, lest it should bruited be To mortal hearing by the blabbing air! A spirit haunts thee still, whose voice was on The winds, and in the many-scented grove, And in Man's dwellings, but no echo now Does Earth from all her caves give back, to prove That such things were: thus art thou left alone, Like something in a dream, we know not how! Into what strange relations does not Time Bring most familiar things! the flight of years Fits commonest objects for the poet's rhyme! Thus thou art as a link betwixt two spheres, Distinct as dreams are from reality: Since but for thee that world, unto which thou Belong'st, were but a dream, and which so long Has left thee, like a shell, forsaken by Life's ebbing ocean, that I in my song May put thee to a use undreamt 'till now! Within thy narrow space of sculptured rim Are ages buried, all their noise and strife But dust and silence! oh! how faint and dim The records of a nation's mighty life! A babe would occupy a larger space Than Time to the huge bulk of hopes and fears Of centuries accords! some words which we, Like children playing with a puzzle, trace, Hold forth a seeming light, which disappears, And leaves us groping still in mystery! What language speak'st thou? did the maiden's tongue, Trembling, pronounce with it a lover's name, Did statesman thunder with it, or sweet song Stir up Men's hearts with Truth's own sacred flame? Faithful to its high task it answers not: Yet, still in silence eloquent, it says, “The Past is even this same dust you see, Its pomp and glitter here, behold its lot, And take thou warning hence: the present day's Thine own, the past is in Eternity!” Oh silence, far more eloquent than speech, Oh little monument of mightiest things, Oh blank, that more than volumes-full dost teach, Thou hast more dread and awe than waits on kings! Within thy circuit lies the round of life— Cup of Oblivion, for such thou art, Time proffers thee unto me, and I drink Forgetfulness of Being's passing strife: Which, like the little dust within thy brink, Seems nought already, as thereof 'twere part! Oh elixir divine, by mortal hand Not mixed, but by the subtle elements Themselves, which Being and Decay command, And all the ebbs and flows of our intents, And motions of the spirit, thee I drain, As one, athirst for immortality, The cup an angel proffers unto him! Medea would have mixed such draught in vain, But, in this, Time both and Eternity, Like two rich wines, are mixed, full to the brim! ON SEEING A GRAVE-STONE. And is this all that now remains Of thee, thou good and lovely one, An idle name, which, with some pains, We trace on this weed-cumbered stone? These few, poor letters on it writ, How little can they tell of thee! The passer-by sees but in it A grave, but 'tis thy grave to me! Weeds only on it grow, alas! For flowers here should flourish none, When thou, the fairest, so could'st pass, As tho' Earth had not thee alone! A few, poor letters! yes! a few, Poor, common letters! yet, in all The alphabet, what letters do On eye or ear like those few fall? I do remember thee in days Of which thou wert the hope and light: But now this cold-lipp'd marble says That thou canst no more bless my sight! I do not weep: my breast is too, Too full, itself in tears to vent, But it doth think such thoughts as thro' The heart, that thinks and breaks, are sent! Is this thy grave, thou lovely one! Art thou indeed beneath this sod? And is it I who stand upon Thy grave! have mercy on me, God. This grass, tho' rank, is fresh and green, I cannot think that it is so! It speaks of what is, not has been: Then why shouldst thou lie here below? Why should the meanest thing thus live, When thou, the fairest, best of all, Wert but allowed so long to live To show that best things soonest fall? Few feet of earth now sever me From all I loved, my life's sole star; Few feet! oh bitter mockery! So small the space, and yet so far! 'Tis but a little, crumbling sod, A shovelfull of niggard earth: Why dost Thou sever thus, O God, With such things, things of heavenly worth? Thou canst not hear my cry of woe, Or else thy gentle voice would speak: Tho' grief be noisy here, below Is silence which no tongue can break! Oh grave, that thou wouldst ope to me, That, crumbling dust to dust, my heart Might blend with thine, and henceforth be Joined never, never more, to part! TRUE VICTORIES. Truth has calm conquests, where the sword and spear Can claim no part—not loud or noisy, tho' Of mightiest results: and from these flow The blessings which, with heart-deep ties, endear The altar and the fireside, and rear, On the sublime affections which thence grow, (Eternal pillars, proof against each blow Of outward chance and self-betraying fear) The state's vast fabric, on its one sure base; For brute force reaches not unto the thought And heart of Man, nor can it thence displace One prejudice—great changes must be wrought By Men's best feelings, thro' their ownselves: they Must work the good for themselves, their own way, Else it is none to them, it is as naught: Man is not a machine, that's made to play, And spin his happiness, so much per day! Let but the inward eye of Reason first See clear: instruct him to allay his thirst At the pure waters from Truth's springheads brought, And thou may'st leave the rest to him—they ought Surely to know best their own wants—the worst Of all ways is by force to make Men do That which alone can be reached, surely, thro' Their own cooperation, their own will And feelings, which once forced, the object still Remains imperfect, unattained, nay grows A bitter evil; for the wise man knows That there is only one compulsion, one Divine constraint, by means the gentlest won, Whereby men can, sublimely, certainly, Be urged to godlike things: and that is, of Truth, truth divine, and still diviner love: The cónstraint of the God within the breast, Whose fiat gained, brings over all the rest; For, still, by gentlest ways the highest ends Are gained, and that, which will not break, soon bends! Kind words are mightier than the hand of Force, And Mens' affections, led into their course, Flow gently, which, obstructed, fret and chafe, And make, what else were easy, hard, unsafe; And Love is mightiest, and maketh all The motions of Man's spirit musical! And what are hand and sword without the heart? As reeds within a child's weak grasp at best: Which break short, when home to their object pressed. And with it? less—what boots the meaner part, When that which is most godlike is possest? Then use them not: use thoughts! these are the true And viewless rundles of the ladder of All spiritual greatness: far above Earth's mists they lift us, full in God's own view; By these His angels missions bring of Love, (Our thoughts the imagin'd wings on which they move) And God himself makes use of them, as do His angels, only with a higher view, The Jacob's ladder which He sometimes déscends too! ODE TO PSYCHE. Let not a sigh be breathed, or he is flown! With tiptoe stealth she glides, and throbbing breast, Towards the bed, like one who dares not own Her purpose to herself, yet cannot rest From her rash essay: in her trembling hand She bears a lamp, which sparkles on a sword: In the dim light she seems a wandering dream Of loveliness: 'tis Psyche and her Lord, Her yet unseen, who slumbers like a beam Of moonlight, vanishing as soon as scann'd! One moment, and all bliss hath fled her heart; She with her eyes the vision will dispel, And break the dreamy charm no magic art Can e'er replace; alas! we learn full well How beautiful the Past but to deplore! While, with seal'd eyes, we hurry to the brink, Blind as the waterfall; oh stay thy feet, Thou rash one: let thine eye not covet more Of bliss than thy heart feels, nor vainly think That sight will make thy vision more complete! Onward she glides, and, gliding, doth infuse Her beauty into the dim air, that fain Would dally with it: and, as the faint hues Flicker around, her charmëd eye-balls strain, For there he lies, in dreamy loveliness! Softly she steals towards him, and bends o'er His eyes sleep-curtained, as a lily droops Faint o'er a folded rose: one meek caress She would, but dares not, take: and, as she stoops, A drop fell from the lamp she, trembling, bore. Thereat, sleepfray'd, dreamlike the god takes wing, And soars to his own skies, while Phyche strives To clasp his foot, and fain thereon would cling, But falls insensate; so must he who gives His love to sensual forms sink still to earth, Whose soul doth cater to a wanton eye. Psyche! thou should'st have taken that high gift Of love as it was meant, that mystery Had use divine: the Gods do test our worth, And, ere they grant high boons, our hearts would sift! Hadst thou no divine vision of thine own? Didst thou not see the object of thy love Clothed with a beauty to mere sense unknown? And could not that bright Image, far above The reach of sere decay, content thy thought? Which with its glory would have wrapp'd thee round, To the grave's brink, untouched by age or pain! Alas! we mar what Fancy's womb has brought Of loveliest forth, and to the narrow bound Of sense reduce the Helen of the brain! End of the Miscellaneous Pieces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY DREAMS, AND THEIR POSSIBLE INFLUENCES ON CONDUCT, AND WHAT MAKES “A THING REAL.” Oft in my dreams, when prayer has soothed my mind, Have I received, by spiritual means, Celestial consolations, ill-deserved: Sweet compensation for Time's passing griefs; Visions etheréal rose on the calm And solemn midnight, o'er my pillowed head, As to sphere-music, o'er that head which seemed To rest upon an angel's wing: the while He, with the other, bending downwards, made Celestial airs to fan me, whispering low With voice elysian, that seemed to make The mute Air rapturous, as if it held Its breath, and listened! visions of the blest, Which but to look on made me happy: forms Bright as if from the rainbow they had stepped, And with the beauty of eternity, As with a garment, clothed, that wrapped them 'round With a dim loveliness—like Morning half- Concealed by the bright halo round her head, In her own glory veiled! and on their brows Wearing that calm and sweet serenity, Which they who have no fear for coming ills, No retrospects forlorn, alone can know— There do we meet ('neath calm and sunny skies, Whose beauty storm defaces not, fit type Of that internal calm which virtue gives) The beings we have loved in other days, Arrayed in forms not subject to the worm, Beyond the sway of Time; clear, sunny brows, Fresh as the morning, in its youthfulness— Where never care has ploughed a furrowed line: And eyes more lovely than the evening-star, At prime of even, when all heaven seems To look through it, with concentrated love! And lo! they welcome us, with lips that make The balmy air more balmy, with sweet words, In a soft, unknown tongue, and nought akin To this frail language of vain hopes and fears: A calm and blessed utterance, which yet, As by an intuition understood, Fills us with joy, and love, and blessedness: Like welcomes, after absence, to the home Where first we drew the breath of infancy. Oh sin not, that these blessed visions be Not snatched from your dim eyes: for gentle Sleep, Who cradles on her breast the guiltless babe, And makes its pillow soft as down, and sends Her dreams, like sun-beams, mantling o'er its head: And strews her darkness o'er its eyelids, like The raven-down upon the wings of Night— She to dread Conscience lends her ministries, And plants the pleasant pillow, which should be Our natural refuge from life's chilling cares, Full of sharp thorns: and sets it full of tongues And eyes, inside and outside (like the wings Of the great angel in the Prophet's dream!) That speak and look unutterable things, E'en to the deaf and blind! the “still, small voice,” Which, laid close to our ear, and whispering low, Swells yet like thunder, on the solemn pause, Making night terrible: like one who comes In darkness, to do that he would not see Himself, at which the light would be aghast! And, with her darkness, she unto our eyes Summons those baleful shapes, from which by day We seek for shelter in the noise, and laugh, And whirl of giddy life, thus drowning Thought By desperate effort of the restless will. Oh sin not then—shut not this door, which lets In on us visitants from happier worlds: Glimpes of glory, visitings of bright Elysian beauty, through these mists of Time! For, if we have but faith therein, a dream May be the vehicle of truths divine— Celestial messenger, like Mercury, Though winged from higher worlds than those he knew— For in our sleep we know not what we are, Being more than what we know! sometimes in dreams God is most with us, when we thus become Most spiritual—then may we receive High revelations: renovating breaths Of inspiration—what in us is dark, May then be 'lightened—what is low, refined And purified—for then do we become Passive, as clay within the potter's hands; And, when we wake again, although our dream Be gone, and, like a star in daylight, lost, Still it shines on, and still its blessedness Hangs, like sweet perfume 'round us, and is as A pure renewal of our former selves, Th' eternal Self; to which each passing deed, Act, thought, volition, are but as the leaves, Which the tree casts, to clothe itself with new, And better—therefore will I still believe, In spite of cold Philosophy, who loves To rob the soul of its best heritage: To steal the honey from the hive, and kill Imagination's bees, and to benumb, With his torpedo-touch, the heart that throbs In its own fancied joy, that dreams are life. Is not life happiness, and joy, and love? If then an idle dream, well rounded by An hour's length, can crowd in that small space, Or in far less, long years of acted life, (That would bring grey unto the head of Youth) And visions of delight, unknown to Earth, Such as the Angels selves would not disdain; If a brief dream can give us this, oh who So mere a fool, so mere a stickler for Distinctions where there is no difference, As to say “this is but an idle dream,” Because it is not palpable to touch, As is a chair or table; as tho' these Had a more real existence than our thoughts, Because we thus can touch them with our hands! Who would dissolve the diamond of pure joy, In a vile crucible, and, when he saw The paltry dust to which it was reduced, With mighty exultation would exclaim, As at a wondrous and convincing proof, “Behold your diamond, tell us now its worth?” Its worth—to thee 'tis but as that vile dust, Which thou, by decomposing it, hast found; To me 'tis still the diamond sparkling bright, Dust, as you view it, but, as I, a gem More costly than Golconda's mines can yield? As well the Chymist to the diamond might Deny that worth and lustre, because it, When analysed, to charcoal is reduced! When rather, by delight and wonder touched To love and adoration, he should say, How marvellous the powër, which could thus Create a gem so beautiful, from what Appears the meanest product of the earth! That it is charcoal, does not make it less, But more, in worth and wonder: since e'en that Thereby is shown to be, in capable hands, Susceptible of all things beautiful: But thou hast neither capable hands nor heart, Else wouldst thou take to heart all noble things, And prove their value by thy sense of it— Thou turn'st to common dust, by Doubt's vile touch, The golden hopes and joys of life, while I, With but a little fancy, can transform The common dust of circumstance to more Than even gold, to treasures of the sky! Yea! without metaphor, I can take up The trodden dust within my hand, and, in The sun-beam holding it, behold it turn To sparkling grains of gold; and if I do Really believe it such, or worth as much, (And so it is, by surer estimate, And for a higher commerce, than the “Mint” Acknowledges—the commerce of the soul With its great Maker and his goodly works, Wherein that very dust doth current pass, Good “coinage of the realm,” and true, by that Great standard of the Universe, which He Ordained: that Man might ascertain thereby The portion of alloy in things far more Divine than gold or silver; aye, in his Own thoughts and feelings, the sole coin which bears The eternal “Minter's” image—which alone Can purchase heavenly things, and current pass In heaven up-above, as earth below!) If I believe it such, and think it worth Its weight in gold—nay, would not e'en exchange That dust for twenty times its weight in gold, Although of finest carat, lest I should Thereby destroy its value, and that grand Belief, worth more than all the gold on earth, Since it can thus transmute e'en dust to gold, And something more, oh something far, far more, Than gold: a godlike instrument of Good; Which, if it did this only:—if it made A daisy lovelier in my sight, would do More than the wealth of worlds could buy, the power Of Kings accomplish—for, in doing this, So little as it seems, 'twould make me feel The Beautiful and True, and bring me near To God! 'till e'en that daisy in the grass Should shed a halo 'round it, like a star, To glorify the Earth and all therein! If I believe it such then—if that dust To me is so much worth, what more then does The miser in his hoarded gold possess? Or even he, who, worldly-wiser, spends His wealth to gild his pleasures or his toys, And bribe the smiles of Fortune? since, with less, Far better things, and more of these, I buy— An eye, that e'en a painted cloud can fill With tears of holy rapture, and a heart, Which the least flower can make more than rich, Thro' the true feeling of this lovely World; By making me believe, that he alone Is rich, who loves a flower more than gold! Since he, on every side, his treasure finds, Already made—the World, and all therein, In the best sense, is his:—his: to enjoy! No lawyer questions him as to his “right”— No one indicts him for a trespass, as, Among the happy valleys and green hills, He harmless walks, and feels it all his own, By right divine, unquestioned, unreproved! And yet, altho' he claims so much, nay, all He sees, he uses all his rights in love, And for love—yea, he doth not rob one flower From the least garden, nor a foot of ground, To swell his selfish acres, as some do, Who swallow up all 'round them, and lay waste A thousand homes, to shut their fellow-men Out from all sight and hearing! nay, the more Partake thereof with him, the more he has, Their joy too, in addition to his own! And if he be not rich, O thou, whom gold So dazzles, tell me could'st thou buy, with all Thy wealth, the title-deeds to this his fair And rich estate, which God hath “sealed and signed!” Go to thy bags of gold, and think, oh think, How few of life's real blessings it can buy— Thou canst not bribe, with this, the bird to sing, A flower to blossom in thy path, the air, Unpaid Musician! for thy deadened ear To play one least, least melody of all That, for the meanest creature he has still In store, that loves to listen! still less, oh! Still less, canst thou procure therewith, thou fool, The feeling of the Beautiful and True, In which thy very wealth still keeps thee poor! Poorer than e'en the beggar, who, with naught But this, is still, compared with thee, a King! And, if thou must then something decompose, Then decompose thou that: Oh decompose That gold, and all that it doth gild and gloss: The glittering baubles of this world; and thou Wilt find them, like that miser's gold, return To what they are indeed, when tested thus, Vile dust, like that I hold within my hand: Yea, and, this time, thou wilt not be deceived! But thou would'st turn to dust the holiest things, By disbelieving them: that is the one Most sure way to annihilate: to bring The soul itself to nothing—thou canst not, 'Tis true, destroy one least, least particle, One atom, with thy crucibles, of all That make up this fair world; but, for thyself, Thou canst destroy the Godlike and the Good, Yea! God himself! for he exists no more To thee, if thou believ'st not in him! yea! Thou canst reduce to something less than dust The kiss of first, chaste Love: and, with a doubt, Pierce to the heart Love itself, and, through that, All else wound mortally; put out the eye Of Faith sublime, distune the Poet's harp, Rob the rose of its perfume, and make life Fall, like a withered flower, in the dust! This canst thou do, all this, O Man but thou Canst do far more than this; for, after all, This is to do but little, nay, e'en less Than little—nothing—into nothing all That's best and fairest to reduce! but thou Canst work the Godlike: yea! like God himself: For he it is that works it in thee; thou Canst out of nothing—or, at least, from what Is next to nothing—from a flower, or That very dust I hold within my hand, Create the feeling of the Beautiful And Godlike, for thyself, for evermore— This canst thou for thyself create—if not For others: yet for others too—for thou, When for thyself thou hast created it, Becom'st its medium to them—and when Thou hast done merely this, then hast thou, like A great Magician, whom the elements Owe fealty to, created this whole world Godlike likewise; created it, without Vain charms and incantations, save but one, The master-charm, the charm of thy own Thought: Which fashions for thee, after thy own heart, The world in which thou dwellëst, and which is The Sinai, on whose top thou art with God: The Pisgah too, from whence thou may'st behold The “promised land,” and long, delightedly, Beforehand, in anticipation sweet, Enjoy! I say “create” the world, and say Most truly: for the world, wherein we live, That is but the reflection of ourselves, Our feelings, and, as these are, so is it. And, if we feel things godlike, they are so, At least to us! and, after all, what is The “Real,” the “Practical,” words so much mouthed, Which the World's tongue trolls forth so eloquent? Calling in question e'en those great ideas And principles, which, from the depths of Thought Evoked, like guardian-angels of mankind, Soon set a million hands at work, or plant The flowers round a million cottage-doors, The love of Nature in a million hearts! And yet are not called “real:” mere “theories,” “Abstract ideas:” until they have done this; And wrought what and where nothing else can work, Within, at heart, which setteth tongue and hand In motion, else immoveable as rocks— Yes, wrought, like spirits, out of sight, of Man, But not of God: whose work they silently Fulfill—like spirits, yet at the command Of Man, who doth his Master's work likewise, And mightier than the Genii of old, That served Aladdin's lamp, for these are real: And work him wonders, passing-wonderful, And build him palaces, of more than stone And marble, mansions where his soul may dwell: (Abodes of light) and be as angels are! And give this work-day world a beauty too Far beyond fairy tale: more beautiful, By so much as it is more true, more real! Its loveliness a thing of every day, As common as the rose, and yet as rare, As passing-beautiful and wonderful! Yet scarcely noticed, just because it is So common: which should be a greater cause Of wonder: that such loveliness should be So common, so a thing of every day! Fairer than dreams, yet not more fair than real! But, that alone is real to us, which we Think so and feel so: or, in other words, 'Tis our own thoughts and feelings which alone Are real, and give reality—then think And feel all godlike things to be so, most Of all—most real: and such they will become— And feeling this, thou wilt not feel in vain, That feeling is the thing itself—the rest Are but the rags and perishable part Of Time, who, like a beggar, here and there, Picks up his motley covering: sometimes Wearing Truth's cast-off clothes, that he may pass For something better than he is—unto The worldly man, the bag of gold he grasps, The dainty morsel melting in his mouth, The pomps and vanities of place and power, Are not so real as are the Poet's dreams, His thoughts and feelings, for are they not these? And what he feels and thinks, is that not real? Is it not his own heart, himself? and, when He feels the Godlike, is he not of God, Nay, God himself, as the scent of the rose Is the rose itself: so far as he feels The Godlike truly? and what then is real If God be not, who is all things in all? Nay, is the tear within his eye, the heart That throbs and glows, not real, pray, e'en in that Low sense, which ye call real? as real as is The chair on which ye sit, the bread ye eat? And, if these then be real, how much more so Must that which caused them be! the godlike thought, That brought the tear into the eye—the true, Deep feeling, which made that same heart to beat! And what is practical? who clutches most Vain shadows? or who dreams the idlest dreams? Oh tell me, ye who waste on vilest things Divinest: ye, who pluck the blushing rose Of chastity from off the Maiden's brow, Not for its divine perfume, but to make Vile lucre by that which the angels in Their wreaths might wear: who lay up what the moth And rust shall wear away; or he who, with His godlike feelings satisfied, goes back Unto his God, with ten, instead of one Poor talent: with a treasure, which no change Of time and place can rob him of, so long As he is himself, for that is his wealth, Himself; and he who feels himself, that is The Godlike, he possesses Life's chief good, The one great end of Life, and crowning charm, Unrobable, and all its other goods To this add nought, without it are all nought! And is this then a shadow, is there aught So real to us as we ourselves? or what Is so to us, save through ourselves? then seek The Real, which lies within the reach of all, For each may be himself, his whole self; yea! The Emperor, on his throne, can not be more, The Beggar, by the road, need not be less; Nay! even God himself, is but himself, And therefore is he God, allgood, allwise! But little in the world are these truths heard, And as a driveller my name may pass From mouth to mouth, a dreamer of vain dreams! But yet I do not dream—or, if I do, It is with open eyes, and kindling brow O'er which the halo of Humanity The consciousness of Man's immortal lot Gathers, transfiguring—for, as I write These words, I feel my heart beat in my breast, With exultation at them: like a God Expanding into full divinity, For the first time, all heaven on his brow! That must be real and godlike, which can make The heart beat thus—or, if it be a dream, It is a goodly dream, with a great heart Within it—aye, a heart more living far Than beats in many a living breast—a dream Divine, that realizes its own self! And far, far better is a dream, which makes The heart to beat godlike, and fills it with God's living truth, than a reality (If that be real which wants the truth of Life) Which leaves it, like a stone, untouched and cold! But I, I am awake, awake in Him Who made me, unto Him: because I feel Him who alone is Life—tho' but, as 'twere, A mere grain in that hand which still upholds The stars, though countless as the ocean-sands: Yet not lost to his eye sublime, which knows No littleness; how unlike Man, who, in His pride, thinks many things so little, while 'Tis but himself that is so—for he makes Them little—aye the greatest, godliest things, By thinking them so! but to God nought can Be small, for, being himself in all things, He feels them thro' himself, and therefore feels Them godlike! yea! I am awake: at heart— In the most Vital therefore—so much so, That e'en the smallest flower at my feet Can stir my heart to overflowing: till My spirit, like its perfume, melts away In blessedness and love: how much more, oh! How much more than a flower of the field, Aught that concerns my fellow-creatures then! So much so that the child's least voice awakes The whole, deep music of Humanity, And pours it on my ear and on my heart! I am awake, if this be to be so; And, if this be not, tell me then what is? Awake ye then, who dream with open eyes, Who seeing, see not, and with ears can't hear; 'Tis time that ye awake, ye fools, and learn This truth—the value of all things alone Lies in the temper with which we receive What heaven sends us: making Good and Ill From things indifferent, or their contraries, So for itself—for in the soul itself, (Sought elsewhere still in vain) the fabled stone, That can transmute the common dross of life, Its passing shows, its miseries and pains, Into pure ore, resides: to more than gold: To that which makes gold itself seem but vile, And needless as 'tis vile! ethereal gift! A boon of blessedness, and joy, and peace, Which old Philosophers, with bootless toil, Searched for in outward things, o'erlooking still That small space bosomed in the human breast, The heart, which all it touches turns to gold: To Beauty and to Good, far more than gold! The wise man's kingdom, where he reigns supreme O'er passions tamed by reason, o'er high hopes And calm desires, like yon clear, still stars, Which, far removed from all mutations here, Give light still to each other and the sky, Thro' which they move, like music visible; For, like these, with a steady light they shine, And have their risings and their settings fixed, By moral gravitation, which still draws Them so, so gently, yet resistlessly, Towards their great centre, God: with whom he moves Concentric, his calm eye fixed ever there: Looking beyond the earth, therefore unmoved And undisturbed by earthly injuries! THE STORY OF ÆSON TRANSFORMED BY MEDEA; A HEATHEN FABLE CHRISTIANLY MORALIZED. What reek is yon, upcurling to the skies? What victims, all with garlands newly bound? What songs are these that from the shores arise, Wherefore those augurs, duly robed and crowned? What solemn rite have they met to perform, For venture safe-returned from war or storm? Lo! 'tis the bark of Jason, like a steed That knows his pasture, bounding to the shore, While rumours of the far-famed fleece precede His coming, sending golden gleams before! And hark! that shout hath welcomed him again, To the remembered strand, not left in vain! And there was feasting through th' Æmonian land, And oft the goblet, flower-wreathed, was drained To Bacchus, and Joy came not to a stand, Till Pleasure's o'er-brimmed cup no more contained— But Jason grieved, for Æson was not there, In all this triumph and this joy to share. Already Death and he had shaken hands: He leaned on Time, as 't were upon a crutch, That answered less as grew more his demands; Aye, Death's cold hand already his did touch, And shook Joy's cup from it—life had become A twice-told tale, its music was nigh dumb! The moon is up in heaven, at the full, And maketh noon, in faint similitude Of day, more shadowy, yet as beautiful. With golden increase to that plenitude Of light she's grown: that, like herself, the spell, Now to be wrought, may work, and fully tell. Lo! like a spectre in the wan moonshine, Dim as some figure on old tapestry, Yet lovely still, though now but an outline, Like that of some old marble 'gainst the sky, Medea flits, with hair that scattered flows, And changeful shadows o'er her beauty throws! She seems just like the moon, that at each cloud Grows dim, yet in its shadow lovelier Than when in all her light arrayed so proud, Clothed in the beauty of the stars around her! Her golden hair doth on the darkness break In flashes, like a falling star's bright wake! Lo! with mysterious right she doth constrain The king of ghosts to listen to her prayer, That Æson, whom the laws of fate enchain, May cheat the grave, and still breathe upper air. And, that the approaching charm may with it bring A full accomplishment, thus doth she sing. Thou Night, that, with thy thousand blinking eyes, Seëst, yet seemest not to see, unlike The staring sun, that into secrets pries, And through dark corners doth his bold beams strike: Bend down thine ear, propitious to the spell, Thou that mak'st secrets, and canst keep as well! Thou Earth, that into plant and herb dost send Strange influence from thy mysterious core, Whither all powers at thy surface tend, And themselves so renew for evermore: Auspicious be, and give to every plant Each mystic property the charm may want! And ye, whose operations shun the light, Mysterious powers of darkness, who instil Into the herb that creeps or climbs, in spite Or love, the juices that preserve or kill, And those which death, and death's own image, sleep, Cause, and their opposites in Nature keep. Ye, I adjure—and ye, assist me now, Thou elemental fire, and thou air, That warm the root, and work in bud and bough, Join all your vital strengths, in union rare: That like the springtide sap may be my spell, And work like that, life's powers to compel. And, lo! a tremulous light runs through the stars, Presaging thus a favourable end, As if of those eterne abodes the Lars Mysterious recognition so would send: And through the earth a shudder runs, as it Trembled those magic powers to transmit! And upward, from the realms below, there came A hollow murmur, and then died away, In the deep forest, through its leafy frame Making each tree to shiver, leaf and spray: As if the muttering wind strange things had said, Causing each living thing an unknown dread! Lo! like a corpse, lies Æson on the ground— With drug Lethean hath Medea layed His sense asleep, as Death at last had found, Disguised as Sleep, his prey, in ambuscade. The muttered spells work on his sense meanwhile, And to the change his nature reconcile! And, by yon rising star, she casts anew His horoscope, that he with it may run Another race, and feel its influence through That life renewed, and with that star begun. Pow'rs mysterious, yet out of Nature's course, Assist, but thus lose all their better force! Now seeths the cauldron, full of magic broth: With wondrous juice and charms potential, It works amain—for where the slabby froth Boils over, of its use prophetical, It clothes the withered herbage in fresh green, And calls forth flow'rs, as there May's foot had been! So, round it, in the grass it forms a ring Of magic verdure, such as those we see: And still, where-e'er its drops renewing cling, They change that which they touch, whate'er it be: Making the very stick that stirs it flower, As though Spring's hand had touched it in its power! But now on Æson must its force be tried, His veins replenished with the juice she fills: And first his heart 'gan beat within his side, And through his bosom a strange feeling thrills; And youth renewed, yet hovering on the extreme Of consciousness, hangs round him like a dream! He feels like one who dreams that he is young Again, yet knows not whether it be true: Like one who, when his funeral bell hath rung, Is on a sudden snatched from the grave's view. At length he opens up his eyes, and thinks, And from his altered self, half-frightened, shrinks! And consciousness comes slowly back again, Filling the empty channels of his thought With fancies strange, half wonder and half pain, Floating the weeds and settlings thither brought Through many a stagnant year, with currents strange, From Life's great sea, whose tide doth turn and change! Low, on the vital shore, that mental tide Had ebbed—its voice, once mighty, scarcely made, At distance, sound enough to it to guide! And now, o'er wrecks of time, it seems to invade The long-deserted strand—so, long he tries To touch the bottom of these mysteries! He feels the wrinkles from his brow depart, His limbs plumped out to youthful gracefulness, Fresh vigor breathed into each mortal part, His feet, with airy tread, Mercurial press The ground, and down his shoulders flow his locks, Yet something still, within, the wonder mocks! Yes, Disappointment, like a grinning ape, Sits there, concealed, and mocks the outward change, The feeling, from which he cannot escape, That what he sees is not so true, as strange— No throb runs through his heart, no pulse of bliss, His body's changed, his heart unaltered is! He stands as one who sees a wonder wrought Upon another, in astonishment, As if he had no share in it, nor thought The wonder for himself could e'er be meant! His heart within hath given him the lie, The spell hath over it no mastery! For magic, where Truth is, falls powerless— Her divine image, like an amulet, Within his heart, the magic doth suppress, And by a counter-charm the charm is met! A greater charm, charm made in heaven above, To keep things in their places, by great Jove! And if, to erring mortals, he permit At times a wider latitude in things Indifferent, 'tis for their benefit, To make them wiser by their wanderings— And, if o'er flesh and nerve he grants brief sway, 'Tis but to teach man not to disobey! 'Tis but to show how little can be wrought By these things, e'en when placed at his command, That Man's true magic lies but in the Thought Which changes Spirit, not in spell or wand! That there is fitness in all He hath made, By these vain interruptions more displayed. Man, yearning towards th' invisible world, hath long Perplexed his brain its powers to compel, And, groping towards the light, took still a wrong Direction, and still missed the one, true spell! He sought, without him, its pow'rs to controul, While the invisible World was in his soul! And, feeling vaguely this great truth, yet not Enough enlightened to perceive it all, As one who treasure knows, yet not the spot, He spirits thought by force of spells to call— While, from the depths of his own soul, he might Have called forth shapes of beauty and of light! Thus Æson stood, as one just from a dream Aroused, not yet awake, nor yet asleep, He seemed as changed, and yet did only seem, 'Twas on the surface, but not in the deep; Like a reflection on still water, which, If moved, is gone—made only to bewitch! He shakes him, as to shake off some strange thought, Ha, ha! he shouted, forcing show of joy, But the vain effort no glad laughter brought, With the new roses of his cheek to toy! He raises up his arm, youth's strength is there, He drops it at his side, with listless air! In form a young man, but in heart an old, He has the worst of both, without the good Of either, and an evil manifold, Which neither of their separate lists include— He wants the calm of age, the bliss of youth, And both he seems, yet neither is in truth! Amongst the young he is not young, nor old Amongst the old: he cannot love again: Venus will not resume a heart grown cold, And Bacchus those false lips no more will stain, Except in mockery—the worser part Has Youth, Old Age the larger still, the heart! Amongst the young he finds not sympathy, Nor feels—an interloper's name he bears— Amongst the old he has not dignity Nor reverence, the glory of gray hairs! Mournful, he views the sports age cannot share, Sadder the honors which that age should wear! A living contradiction thus he goes, A Man who dreams a life, and lives a dream, Which others know not, and himself scarce knows, Yet would know less, oh misery supreme! So nothing to him is but what is not, And what he was he is, yet has not got! And Death, defeated of his prey awhile, Hath ta'en in fee his heart within instead, And even Hope hath nought to reconcile This union of the living and the dead! He has outlived the joys he should have had, And, for more sorrow, seems, yet is not, glad! So learn, vain mortals, to obey high Jove, And deal not ever in forbidden things, What he ordains, he has ordained in love, Unlawful pleasures always leave their stings: And he who would youth's race run o'er again, Thus shows that he has run that race in vain— More than content not magic can make Man— This is the end of all his spells, and he Might reach this ere with magic he began! Or with a magic to which all are free: The spells of his own thoughts, which supersede All others, and are better far indeed! These he is authorized to use, for these God himself gave, and blessed them to his use; A “natural magic,” which doth never cease To operate: whose spirits ne'er refuse, When called for, to appear—and it is his Own fault if they appear in forms amiss! The world is full of magic, full of charms, Would Man but use them as they were designed, To work him bliss, and shield him from all harms! Yea! in the simplest things he spells may find— And, in the true magician's hand, a flower Can call up Beauty, like a wand of power! Then work these wonders all of ye—yea! all— For e'en the little child hath at command Spirits of Love, whom e'en a word can call, A look, and lo! before him they all stand! God works his wonders thus, and would'st thou then, Could'st thou, find higher charms, thou, Earth's poor denizen! GRAVE-CHUSING. Oh! Father, let me buried be In yon' sweet churchyard nook, Beneath the shadowy, old yewtree, Hardby that pleasant brook; There lay me where, a child, I played, For something seems to bless The spot, there lay me, 'neath the shade Of bygone happiness! And let my grave be near the stream, As by the side of one, I love, so shall I, though I dream, Have something dear, when gone! Its voice, though I shall hear it not, Makes music very meet For that same calm and quiet spot, The injured's last retreat. It has enough of sadness so To be my funeral knell, But not so sad to seem as though Death's voice, like yon' sad bell! It is a song of early days: Snatches of happy times Still meet my ear, as on it plays, But too like jangled chimes. It hath not broken faith with me, Its voice is as at first, It has not wrung my heart, once free As it, no ties has burst. And let there be no stone above, To tell its idle tale, But freshest turf with flow'rets wove, And pérfuming the gale. For I should wish no curious eye To know who I have been, The few who love me, easily Will find the place I ween! Let nought but flowers mark the spot, Its only ornament, Emblems of mortal Man's frail lot, Of one as innocent! As innocent as themselves are, And, like them, trodden 'neath The foot of one who would not spare, But took the part of Death! Who, through the love I bore him, dealt The stroke that lays me low, Who, from the very love I felt, Made my life's bitter flow. But I forgive him, may he live To think of me once more, And to my injured memory give What, living, I deplore! And let there be no ruder sounds Than greet the dawning day, The voice of that sweet stream, which bounds So merry on its way. Let children sport above my grave, And pluck the flowers there, Enjoying, as I myself have, Those hours so fresh and fair: Let them not think on whom they tread, The silence that's below, But laugh, as though there were no dead, And life were ever so! These trembling-voicëd words had brought A tear into her eye, For still it is a bitter thought, So very young to die. Then from her father's breast she raised, Feebly, her sinking head, One moment in his face she gazed, Yet not one word she said. There was a something at her heart, That could not uttered be, She pressed his hand, as those who part For an eternity. She strove to speak again—again His hand she harder prest, Then on that bosom, she had lay'n So oft on, sank to rest. She gasped, one little word to say, One word of all we waste, But, ere 'twas shaped, her lips were clay, A corpse those arms embraced! He answered not, there came no tear, He clasped her to his breast, He listened for a while to hear Her heart, but 'twas at rest! That plaything in Time's hands, which he Had, like a ball, tossed to And fro, lay still—a mysterie Now as when Death was new! And, when I pass'd again that way, The birds were singing there, As though there had been no such day, Nor Man e'er felt despair. I wandered through the churchyard nook, The stream was flowing on, All things wore just the selfsame look, Save one small spot alone. A little mound of turf was there, Which was not there before, No other object told me where Slept she who was no more! I sat me down beside her grave, And, though a stranger, I Wept tears, for such her tale did crave, For our Humanity. I paid the debt of Nature there, Which to our kind we owe, In our humanity who share, One heart in all below. The old yew tree quaint shadows threw Upon that humble sod, And on its breast the flowers grew, Emblems of trust in God. The daisy had shot up, meanwhile, As though 'twere common mould, And, in its beauty, seemed to smile At all that's dead and cold! The grass was fresh and fair, as if Such things could never be, I plucked a flower, that drew its life From mould that once was she! And thus we pass away, and leave No void in the vast chain Of Being, and scarce one will grieve Or think of us again. Our name is cast upon the winds, Our memory is gone, And all the curious searcher finds At best is a gravestone. Ask of this many-centuried tree, Who sleeps beneath his shade? Will Nature, think'st thou, answer thee? She cares not for the dead! She twines her flowers round her brow, And sings her songs again, A thousand years from hence, as now, Though men die and complain! She cometh with the flowers of spring, And hides Earth's old, sad graves, And generations new doth bring, Waves following still on waves! And so she dances onward still, Forgetful of the Past, To music of the bird and rill, The same from first to last! While she, who sleeps beneath that sod, Is as the flower fair, A thousand years ago downtrod, Gone, no one can say where! FIRST LOVE. She stood beside me in the shade, The starry shade of heaven's blue, Whose lamps, like nuptial torches, made By love eterne, their soft light threw. She stood beside me, while the air, Like the pure breath of Heaven, came, Whispering a blessing, as it were, Where neither sin had part, nor shame. She stood beside me, and my youth, With all its dreams and visions high, Seemed in her form to grow to truth, And pass in living beauty by. As erst through my own heart they passed, Stirring it like first Love's long kiss, So on my sense they shone at last, And turned those dreams to waking bliss. She stood beside me, like a flower Bowed by the dewy evening air, In modest fear, yet conscious power, I thought she never looked so fair. Like the sweet lily of the vale, She drooped her lovely brow beneath The shade of its own beauty, pale As moonlight, daring scarce to breathe. I took her hand, it trembled so, And yet no thought of wrong was there, It trembled in its own deep bliss, As trembles love alone, and prayer! Ah! bliss that has no fellow here, Whose memory alone is worth All after-joys, how sweet soe'er, For these all savour of the earth. But this, oh this is heaven's own, And bringeth heaven with it still, And bliss and beauty, like the zone Of Venus, scatters where it will! I gazed upon her pure, bright face, Through which the peace of Heaven shone, And earth seemed as a holy place, That angels themselves might dwell on. That face she half had turned away, Yet pressed me closer to her heart, Because, the less she dared to say, The more her feelings took my part. As if she feared too much to do, And then, disowning such a fear, Did more than she first meant, or knew She did, then shrank at the idea! A cloud across the moon had passed, And, in the shadow which it made, I caught the full look of deep love she cast Upon me, from its ambuscade! But, when that cloud had passed away, Her face once more was bent aside, As if she feared it might betray, What but just now she could not hide! I could not speak—mine eyes were dim, And, like a child, scarce knowing why, I wept: for when the heart is brim, It needs must waste some drops, or die. As, in the breathless heavens, some Full cloud hangs on the heated air, From which a few big tear-drops come, To ease what else it could not bear. Waste, do I say! it is not so, Love is no miser of the heart: To him there is no Future, no, He has no Self, no meaner part. He cannot thus economise, Nor, from the sole, deep springhead, save, For the waste which before him lies, Aught for what future wants may crave. Yet were it well that Passion's breath Ne'er flared to waste his holy flame, That burning calmly on till death, It lit him to an higher aim. An higher aim! and can there be An higher aim than thus to love, Nought in the world to feel or see, Save our own bliss, and Him above? Of all thanksgivings that are known, What for the God of Love so fit, As thus to be but love alone, With His own self made one by it! Aye, wisdom comes with after years, The wisdom of the niggard brain, But the heart too a wisdom bears, An alchymy ne'er found again. An alchymy which changes all Within its reach to more than gold, To things divine, poetical, To beauty and to bliss untold! But love grows calculation, grows A miser—not poured from the heart, Like the full perfume of the rose, No more our being, but a part. When I look back on that sweet hour Of Love, and Love's first, pure caress, I feel that all Man's idle lore Less than the heart's least beat can bless. I see again the well-known spot, I hear her light step on the ground, I hear her, though I see her not, My eyes have in my ears eyes found! I feel her quick heart throb 'gainst mine, And in my arms I seem to hold The world and all that is divine Therein, while her I thus enfold! Long years have flown since then, yet what Are they? the echo of a sound! But this endures, and shall, when not A vestige of aught else is found. That picture, in this frame of Time, Still keeps its colours, fresh, divine, As are, when Morning first doth climb The sky, the hues her form enshrine. And, when this outward sight grows faint, That picture on these inner eyes, Of her, my Love, my more than Saint, My Life's Aurora, still shall rise! Rise, like the Morn, to make me day, And songs and gladness, and all good, When I should else be dark, and stray, Still in the night, with night's dark brood! Methinks I see her as she stood, Wrapped in a veil of beauty by The calm moonlight, which with a flood Of glory clothed her to my eye. Wrapped in a haze of silvery light, Her outline seemed to blend with it, And like an angel, to my sight She seemed, just on the earth alit! She looked an emanation of That holy light, and her white vest, Like a dove's plumage, seemed to move Above her gently-heaving breast: An halo round her brow was shed, Such as the Saints in pictures wear, But hers was real, and she not dead, But standing living, blushing there! Soft as a star her blue eye shone, Yet turned in bashfulness away, As if she feared to trust upon My prying glance its telltale ray. Yet to her hand a gentle thrill Th' involuntary heart conveyed, For, 'mid his artifice, love will Forget his part, the first time played. He cons his task in secret o'er, And perfect seems in all his part, Yet, when he plays that part before Another, Nature conquers Art. Timid her hand she half drew back, And blushed as it had been broad day, Then gave it half again—alack! When Love's in earnest 'tis his way. But true Love never long will vex, Or fling away the heart it seeks, Though, for a moment 't may perplex, Its frowardness itself most piques! She turned in virgin majesty, In simple dignity and grace, Nature alone shone in her eye, And Love sat blushing in her face! Meaning no wrong, and fearing none, She rayed me with a smile, more bright Than round a child's frank brow doth run, When Nature prompts unfeigned delight. Some underwords she murmured low, Like a still summerbrook at eve, When Nature's whispers, as they go, The winds in one sweet murmur weave. I heard, yet heard them not, for all Dear sounds and meanings in them were, No words were half so musical, Or could so sweet a message bear. Words, if they could have made its sense Distinct, had marred its highest spell, The vague, delicious evidence That me she loved, and loved how well! Modest, but frank and free, she came, Like Eve, and sought my throbbing breast, And there her image, aye the same, Lives, by that first embrace imprest. Engraven there as not on wood, Or brass, or marble, by the side Of His divine similitude, To whom she was so near allied! And, if my heart had nought but this, This image of all Good to show, It might for mercy plead at His High bar, when nought else could do so. Thus was she wooed, and won, and wed, And blessings to such love are sent, A heavenly fire, it burns, self-fed, And brightens, like the firmament. Not the volcano's fitful flames, That waste within and scorch around, Then smouldering sink: these Love disclaims, Whose fires are central and profound. But holy warmth, as of the sun, Moulding a little world of joys, Flowers and plants, whereof not one Bears hidden thorns, or fruit that cloys. Blessings be on thee, holy Love! With thee it is indeed to live: For love is life! by thee we prove How most we have when most we give. Aye, though we give our hearts away, Like bread upon the waters cast, With tenfold bliss will Heav'n repay, And give us many hearts at last! 'Tis Love who earns the gifts of faith, 'Tis he who still works miracles, And in his might the spirit hath A tongue that utters oracles. Not false and fabling ones, but grand And true, which from the deep heart come Of the wide World, which is Love, and Which through Love speaks, or else is dumb! Love sees the sunny side alone, And in the autumn leaf not views The emblem of decay, but one Of beauty in its brightening hues! He shrinks not back from grief or pain, He has no eyes or ears for doubt, Thus in each loss he finds a gain, From each fall rises up more stout. He finds no loss who still finds Love, But wisely would lose all, to find That Love which, with gifts from above, Doth, like a temple, make his mind! Fills it with godlike things, with God Himself, who is Himself but Love, And formed Man, else but a vile clod, In His own image, this to prove! His wiser Mind can mould its state Unto the shows of better things, And from the chrysalis create, The perfect form, the angel's wings! Blessëd, then blessëd be his name, And thine, my Love, my spirit's guide, Who taught his worth, and, still the same, Though long a wife, art yet a bride! THE GRAVE-HAUNTER. Why sitt'st thou on that old gravestone, Thou gray-haired Man of many years? Speaks it, like thee, of things by-gone, Why melt thy dim, old eyes to tears? Thereat the old man tremblingly Raised up his time-bowed face of pain, First cast a wistful glance at me, Then bent it on the stone again. Oh 'twas a sad, sad sight, to see That poor, old man, forlorn and lone, Like a storm-scathed and leafless tree, With all its autumn fruitage strown. Of the church-yard he seemed a part, So silent, old, so still and grey, Sitting like Time, without his dart, And mourning over life's decay. Then traced he, with Grief's finger slow, A name he clear'd still as he sate, From rank, oblivious weeds, that grow Till all we love be out of date. Each letter seemed to stab his heart, And, as he cleared the moss away, Ever to pierce him, like the dart Of Death, in ambuscade who lay. When the old man had traced the name, He gazed into my face, and said, —She was the last of all—they came Like spring-flowers, and are now all dead! And yet I live, though old and gray, Mourning for those should cherish me. Thereat he bent him down, and lay Lost in his own deep agony. His bosom heaved with piteous moan, His white hair waved upon the wind, He lay like Grief, not carved in stone, But figured in more moving kind. Such tears are holy, shed by one Who suffers thus, chastised by Heaven, Swifter than prayers their way is won, And pardon for their sake is given. And, when those natural drops were shed, The old man rose from off the stone, And then his tottering steps I led Down the path which his walk had grown. And, when we reached the churchyard gate, He turned, with lingering step, once more, For the old clock had chimed the date Of time, recalling things of yore. Thereon he heaved a deep-drawn sigh, And passed his hand athwart his face, “Heaven's will be done, he said, for I Am a poor sinner, needing grace!” That clock is now as is the voice Of an old friend, who, every while, Bidding me soberly rejoice, Doth still another hour beguile. Tells me another hour is flown, Another weary hour of all The many I've been left alone, In solitude, as 'twere a pall. Then, as we left the church behind, And objects varied as we moved, The scene induced a calmer mind, The old man talked of those he loved. And, as he talked, his grief grew less, Words gave it wings, and made it light, And sorrow half grew happiness, In utterance taking such delight! I was a happy Man, he said, The father of five goodly boys, And one sweet girl, who in my need A ministering angel was; My wife died first, and, one by one, My goodly boys were torn away, Once scathed the stem, the fruit thereon Sank with it, ere my head was grey. Yet still my dear, dear girl was left; In us the spirits of the rest Seem'd blent in one, and, though bereft, I felt I was not all unblest. But Heaven was pleased still more to try My fortitude, and, lest I should Forget that nobler bourne, the sky, Chastised me unto mine own good. There is a fitter place of meeting For spirits lost on earth to view, To teach me what I was forgetting, My girl was soon snatched from me too. Oh stranger, hast thou ever known What 'tis to be alone on earth? Having been loved? to be alone Where many voices cheered the hearth? My girl, she had such winning ways, I half forgot in her the rest, She seemed them almost to replace, And their united love possessed. Oh had you heard her soft-toned voice, Or seen her, at my bedroom door, With tiptoe caution, lest the noise Should rouse me, watch an hour or more. And, if she saw me hide my tears, She'd kiss me, then point to the skies, She had a sense beyond her years, For love perfects the faculties! Yes, he doth give a novel sense Unto the eye and to the ear, And a divine intelligence Unto the heart, none else comes near. Then would she read the sacred page, On some calm, quiet Sabbath-eve, Likest an angel sent to 'suage, With words of promise, those who grieve. But she is in her grave, and I Am here, a lone old man, of years And sorrows full; but misery Shall turn to smiles, though born in tears! The old man's simple tale was done: And we had reached his cottage door, Where a wild eglantine had spun Its thriftless tendrils, pruned no more. The rose had rambled from its stay, And trailed its beauty on the ground, As though dumb Nature would, that way, Show sympàthy mute, but profound! And she doth suffer too with Man, And falleth to neglect with him, And all her charms Elysian, Under a cloud, as 't were, grow dim! For of herself and works Man is The crown and finish still, And when he happiness doth miss, She doth but half her end fulfil! The old Man looked, and shook his head, His grey hairs stirrëd in the wind, “It used not to be so,” he said, “Time has left naught to mourn behind.” They are but emblems of what's gone, Of what has faded from the earth: Of all that's noble, no! not one But has in Heaven a second birth. That untwined eglantine is like Affection fixed on worldly things, Which but in earth its root doth strike, The stay soon gone to which it clings. Yon' rose, there trailing on the ground, Is but the Beauty which decays, Not the eternal and profound, The Beauty which the Spirit has! And with these words the old man turned, And, prophet-like, his features glowed, A holier spirit through them burned, And through the Man th' Immortal showed. If of an old man's blessing thou Disdainest not the humble gift, 'Tis thine, and, when this frame lies low, Some thoughts of me thy soul may lift. Though baffled oft on this cold earth, The love we bear our household hearts, Hath its fulfilment, and imparts E'en by its anguish higher worth. Better it is to suffer thus, And love, though Love the cause may be, Than to live unsolicitous, None loving, and none loving thee. Else God had given not a heart, But, in its stead, a stone, did He Not mean His creatures to take part In all the joys and griefs that be. The old man's blessing and his words Sank through my heart, like fresh-fall'n dew, And, as I turned away, the birds Their strains seem'd blither to renew. Oft have I passed the old man's cot In after years and other mood, And soothed my own with his sad lot, And learnt in evil to know good. There is a wisdom which doth bow, Meek wisdom, taught by sufferings, That wound the heart, therein to sow The seeds of future blessings. And there are tears, which those who weep Make holy in God's sight, above The vain lipworshippers, who keep The letter, but from fear, not love. Where love is not, there is no law, A law unto himself He is: Instead of law, fulfilling law, And in fulfilling finds his bliss. There's wisdom in simplicity, And dignity in lowliness, And to be last is, still, to be Great in our very littleness. And joys there are, in misery, That happiness has never known, A service which is liberty, And visions but to virtue shown. Then let our eyes be dimmed with tears, Our hearts be purified by pain, Faith still can bear the weight of years, And by these mortal losses gain! For, though her crown be one of thorns, 'Tis greater than the crowns of kings, Triumphs, her griefs: glories, her scorns: And martyrdoms her sufferings! A POETICAL PERORATION. Thanks, thanks, great God, part of my task is done: The labourer in thy vineyard now may rest Awhile, and if the thought, that I my best Have essayed, can reward, then want I none! The harp is now laid by, to gather tone And strength, yet ready at the least behest Of Love divine, to plead still for opprest And suffering Humanity—this one Great thought still prompts me, still doth it impart High revelations: 'tis God's voice, and oft It seems to come direct from up-aloft, Now pealing with the thunder, till I start Like prophet from his visions, and now soft As a babe's lisp, pressed to his mother's heart! Yet mightier far in his least cry, than in The rolling thunder's heaven-cleaving din! And, as my lyre first awoke for thee, Sublimest spirit of Humanity! With that best inspiration which must come Fresh from the heart, and finds in all a home, So let thy Spirit prompt the closing strain, Be thou but here, all other Muse is vain. The fabled hoof of Pegasus could make The poet's fountain from the hard rock break, But deeper, from Man's universal heart, The living poesy of life must start! The springhead, which hath never yet been slack, And never will, while Man looks forward and looks back! And now, like lark, soft-dropping from the sky, My song must fold its wings, and silent lie, As flower closing with the evening star; But, though it soar, the Godlike is not far From its low nest, in earth's familiar lap: No, not one tittle further than the sap Is from the blossom, or than God is from The good man's heart! there is no need to roam, For God is with us here, as up above, Yea! in us, if we do but live by love! Then feel it so, and the least flower, that lies Before thee, will, in its own silent way, So touch thee, that the tears shall fill thine eyes, And thou wilt kneel down by its side to pray! Yea! till the bird's least note, or babe's least cry, Will wake up Nature's boundless harmony, Now gliding o'er the earth, now pealing far Through heaven's blue depths, from hymning star to star! It is the heart first opens all the ear! Then do but feel, and thou'lt not fail to hear! Now lay my verse aside, and turn again To week-day life, and, if not all in vain I've struck the chords, then often wilt thou catch, Amid its harshest sounds, some divine snatch Of melody: some chance-note of my strain Will, ever and anon, break on thine ear, Recalling this poor verse, made haply dear For Nature's sake, else little worth indeed: Lasting through her, for that grows never sere Which with her forms is linked! yes, thou shalt hear Heart-reaching music, if thou wilt give heed, Oft, like the cricket's chirrup, where thou ne'er Would'st have expected it: first faint and dim, But straight upswelling to a mighty hymn! Strike but one note, and then, from earth and sky, The whole deep music of Humanity Shall follow: and, if I have done but this, Enough is done, the rest thou canst not miss! Then shalt thou hear far other lyre than mine, A mightier lyre, and touched by hand divine, Of which the hearts of all Men are the strings, Filling the wide world with its murmurings! This shalt thou hear, nay, with thy mortal hand Shalt play thereon, and have at thy command The stops of all its wondrous harmonies, Thy heart the keynote, if thou touch it true! But first thy own heart must be tuned anew— And, to that end, to bright realities Go turn these idle words: in actions true Embody these poor thoughts, then wilt thou be The poet, and not I: the wreath to thee Is due, and from my most unworthy head I pluck it, to adorn thy brows instead! Yes, he, he is the poet, who can make That life which was but poetry, who views The World, like God, through love, clothed in such hues As landscape ne'er from Fancy's touch could take! The sense of human life, in its most low, Unelevated state, to him brings no Rude disenchantment of some cherished dream; The more awake he is, the more 'twill seem Sublime! he would not dream, not if he could: For, to be quite awake, that is the good Man's privilege alone!—awake unto And with God, labouring His will to do; This is to be awake in godlike wise, And who would mix vain dreams, or close his eyes But for a moment? since, awake, he has Far more than dreams, realities which pass Imagination—or where can he be So well as in God's presence, or what see More lovely than the waking eye looks on? For God is in all things, 'tis Him alone They glorify, and Him recall to mind! The Heavens above declare Him, in their kind: And, with their million conscious eyes, soft-bent On Earth, with looks unutterable, vent Their adoration; nor is Earth behind, But proofs enough in her own self doth find, In the least flower that decks her garment's hem, As Heaven in its starry diadem! And who would lose the consciousness of Him, Though but for one least moment? then grows dim The eye, and dull the heart, and we are blind, Not seeing Him, whom all in all things find! Awake thou then with thy whole heart and eye, Feel and see nought but God eternally, This is the godlike way of seeing, this Likens thee unto God, and makes thine eye as His!
