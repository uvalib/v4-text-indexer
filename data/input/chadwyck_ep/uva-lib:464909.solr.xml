      <field name="fulltext">THE Works of Creation. AN Essay on the Universe. IN FOUR BOOKS. Vincit amor Musæ, vincit Deus: ardua quamvis Sit via, non metuit virtus invicta laborem. Palingen. ? Above th' Olympian Mount I soar, Above the Flight of Pegasean Wing. Milton. AN ESSAY ON THE UNIVERSE. BOOK I. The Argument. The Subject proposed at large. Address to the Dutchess of Somerset. An Invitation to the Lovers of Philosophical Science, especially those of the Fair Sex. The Terraqueous Globe, surveyed, with the Distributions and Uses of the Elements: Two of which, only the Earth and Waters, are treated of in this First Book; that concludes, with an Episodical Description of the general Deluge, and a View of the different Hypotheses concerning it. No more a Fisher, by the Reedy Streams, To easy Notes I chaunt the Rural Themes, These pleas'd me once, when, artless in the Shade, I Nature, first, in simplest Charms survey'd. To gaze o'er all her Prospects now I soar; The Streams, and Shades, confine my Haunts no more. Teach me, Fair Tutoress, thro' thy Realms to stray! Steep are the Paths I climb, and long my Way. Light, with thy Rays, my favour'd Feet to press Thy awful Fane, they inmost deep Recess. To midnight Walks, to visionary Cells, To Groves, where Hermit Inspiration dwells, Lead thy chast Vot'ry; while my raptur'd Soul Wou'd range thy devious Lengths from Pole to Pole; To Stars, and Suns of boundless Space wou'd rise: To Worlds, yet, unsurvey'd by mortal Eyes. Thou, whose bright Form the gentlest Heart inspires; Whose pleas'd Regards my sole Ambition fires; Who, rais'd to cherish ev'ry generous Art, Dost, like a Sun, on All, thy Beams impart: By Nature fram'd benevolently kind; Whom Birth not more ennobles than thy Mind: Will Somerset, auspicious Influence deign! While for her Audience, I repeat my Strain? That to her Patronage, long since, addrest Boasts no small Fame, in her Acceptance blest. Perhaps, that, now relabour'd, may appear Chang'd more to please her tun'd, judicious Ear. So got Prometheus, the celestial Ray, To warm, with Life, his Workmanship of Clay. And Ye, whose Taste Philosophy esteems, Not lik'd the less when Verse attempts its Themes, Free from the Spleen that dulls th' Adept severe; In Tempers faultless, as in Judgment clear: But chief, ye Fair, whose tempted Hand invites The Rose of Science, while it's Thorn afrights; Who, by the Poet's Effort, may be won To read deep Systems, that in Prose ye shun. For love of Candour, as for Genius prais'd, Smile on a Muse by generous Motives rais'd, Cheer her bold Flights th' etherial Tracts along; For You I meditate the arduous Song. Hear, how creative Wisdom first design'd This beauteous World, the Seat of Human Kind. Orbicular he turn'd the ductile Mold, And thro' vast Space the pondrous Wonder roll'd; Convenient Form, that round his central Sun The Wand'rer might his annual Circuit run; And on their Thrones reseat, in gentle Sway, The Pow'rs that rule, by turns, the Night and Day; That healthful Tides might unresisted flow, And Seasons change, These Things are impossible, were the Earth plane, angular, or any way contrary to the present Figure. and genial Breezes blow. New, various Modes on Matter he impress'd, And taught th' Atomic Motion where to rest; Spread the sirm Earth's indissoluble Base, And pour'd the liquid Sea's surrounding Space, Then sinely stretch'd aloft the fleecy Air, And bad to upmost Realms the Fire repair, What various Blessings they for Man produce! How wond'rous is the Elemental Use! First let me, Parent Earth, thy Praise rehearse, And be the Theme propitious to my Verse! To thy own Graces similize my Song, Smooth as thy Plains, and as thy Mountains strong: Thy Mountains, whose robust, cementing Bands, With stable Sinews, brace the spacious Lands, Secure the Vales beneath from Oceans force, And check of nipping Winds the noxious Course; On shelter'd Plains reflect the Solar Ray, Whence ripen'd Glebes the Peasant's Toil repay. Their Heights (each form'd some different Tribe to cheer) The largest Vegetable Produce rear: Whose rugged Brakes, impassable and rude, Protect the Savage, solitary Brood. The Tyger here, and Vulture's rabid Kind, Their covert Lares, and shady Eyries find; Whom Nature banish'd from the social Plains, Nor cou'd subsist, with theirs, the milder Trains. Far down their hideous Steeps the frighted Eye Paths, never trod by human Feet, can spy, Prospects of vast Antiquity it views: The Thoughts deep-wildering in a strange Amuse. Where ruin'd Piles of age-fell'd Trees lie hurl'd, That seem the first Productions of the World: At whose dead Roots, in all the Parent-Grace, Rise the young Groves; a verdant numerous Race. And from the bare, bleak Precipice, whose Height Frowns shudd'ring Horror on the aching Sight, One swoln, continuous Sheet the Torrents throw; For ever thund'ring on the Beach below. Cross the whole Earth, link'd close, long, broad, and tall, One Chain they stand, the World's steep, dreadful Wall Their apt Positions, rang'd from East to West, The Vapoury Forces in their March arrest; That, North and South, detaching off their Pow'rs, Wou'd Mid-Land Climes deprive of succouring Show'rs: The humid Prisoners, on their Tops confin'd, Mute, down their Sides, a furtive Passage wind, Then in a gushing Spring their Freedom gain, Or 'scape, a River, murmuring thro' the Plain: While Part, that stop'd, and cool'd, to Clouds unite, Thence, in dark Columns take their cumbrous Flight, Least torrid Climes with barren Droughts shou'd pine, Lest a dry Waste, beneath the burning Line. Their tall Ascents the ambient Landskips show, And useful Minerals find their Beds below. They Bulwarks stand, the safe defensive Mounds Of neighb'ring States, and mark their separate Bounds; And aid the Water-Nymphs their Course to keep, In easy Progress, to their Sire, the Deep. Strange is the Sight Tucoman's Plain unfolds, Whose Mount A Mountain of an amazing Height and Extent in Paraguay, famous by the Name of the Cristal Mountain. the pleas'd American beholds: It's lofty Clifts, a cristal Form display, Like one vast Diamond glittering to the Day. Beneath its huge Extent, a hideous Cave Drinks in, a plunging Currents gloomy Wave. O'er which the Natives, on a caney Raft, In dread Adventure dared their Crew to waft; Whose Length of subterranean Stream to trace Spent the bold Band a whole diurnal Space. Peru's vast Andes, how immense they rise! And Alpine Summits pierce th' inferiour Skies. Damoan's Pike the Persian gives by Night, From its sulphureous Soil, a sparkling Light; From whose clear Heights prodigious, he, by Day, The vastly-distant Caspian A space of more than 180 Miles. can survey. Who knows not, Tenerife, thy boasted Name? Far as the Sun o'erlooks is spread thy Fame. Renown'd in Homer's and in Maro's Song, Ida's and Atlas' Heights shall flourish long; And, crown'd in sacred Lays, Lebanus stands, Proud in her Groves, the Queen of Asian Lands. Descend, my Muse, and view the humble Plain, Haunt of thy Hours, and Emblem of thy Strain, Nurse of the verdant Wreath that crowns thy Lay, The Lover's Myrtle, and the Poet's Bay: Whose mild Retreats his rural Pipe persuades, Hid in thy cooling Bowers, and twilight Shades. Thy level Face, with vary'd Flowers o'erspread, Affords the winding Stream an oozy Bed; Luxurious Pastures yields the grazing Kind, And plenteous Ceres to the toiling Hind. O! who shall bear me from the Noon-Day-Beam To Tempe's flow'ry Walks, and laurell'd Stream? To where Alcinous fragrant Gardens yields, Hesperia Groves, or Enna bloomy Fields? How shall I count the various Reptile Race, Dr. Hook discovered with the Microscope eight Millions, two hundred and eighty Thousand Animalcula in one single Drop of Water, and he suspects Millions of Millions might be contain'd in it. A Method of making these Computations is published by Mr. Lewenhoeck, Phil. Trans No. 131. P. 844. That spread the fruitful Mother's latent Face; Whose ample Legions every Clime supplies Of different Instincts, Textures, Class, and Size, From the enormous Elephant supreme, To the base Mite's scarce visible Extreme? And lower down, what Tribes unnotic'd throng, That Wonder raise, while they elude my Song! In one small humid Speck, the curious Eye Can Millions of their little Forms descry. What Kingdoms of th' innumerous Insect-Kind, On one small Leaf commodious Dwelling find! Perhaps, on this mean Spot, the little Pow'rs View Rivers, Hills, and Fields See Mr. Addison on this Subject, Tatler, No. 119, Spect. No. 420, and 519.; a World like ours. The Ribs, and harder Parts, present their Eyes A Ridge of Mountains, that stupendous rise; Like those tall Summits the Peruvian boasts, Or those that part Iberia's spreading Coasts. Long winding Streams appear their liquid Veins, And their smooth Coats a Width of boundless Plains. O Nature, thy minutest Works amaze, Pose the close Search, and lose our Thoughts in Praise! EARTH! who thy Objects, endless, can excite? Rich Funds of inexhaustible Delight! If on thy Garden's flowery Scene I stay, I gaze bewilder'd at the bright Display. What White can match the Lilly's virgin Snows? What Red the Crimson of the blushing Rose? What regal Purple with the Scabius vie? Or Scarlet match the Poppy's flaming Dye? What Yellow, lovely as the Golden Morn, The Lupine, and the Heliotrope adorn! How mixt a Hue the streaky Tulip stains! How curious the Carnation's marbled Veins! Ethereal Blue the silky Violets wear, And all unite their Sweets in mingling Air. Sing we of Plants and Herbs a various Kind, For Use medicinal, and Food design'd, Effectual to retard th' impetuous Blood, When fev'rish Heats disturb the vital Flood; To free from wan Disease the beauteous Face, And flush the Features with a lively Grace; The Dropsy's swoln Distortion to subdue, Or change th' enfeebling Jaundice' loathsome Hue. They to new Strength the languid Pow'rs reclaim, When pale Consumptions waste the pining Frame, Or paralytic Rheums the Nerves untie, And healing Balm to wounded Limbs apply. With native Sweetness some delight the Sense, And Pleasure to the Sight and Taste dispense. When, in the salutary Garden led, Thy Steps approach the Mint's delicious Bed, How strong its grateful Scent embalms the Place! Or can the flow'ry Thyme thy Bosom grace, Dear to the labouring Bee, and not afford Rich Fragrance from its aromatic Hoard? The od'rous Briar thy Senses will beguile, Or the press'd Bank of hardy Camomile. When vigorous Health thy Appetite renews, Here may thy Hand a cooling Sallad chuse, Or Herbs by culinary Art prepare, For thy plain Board, Pythagorean Fare. Ascend we now the Beauties to relate Of spreading Trees that rise with loftier State, Whose leafy Arms support the feath'ry Throng, Protect their Dwelling, and secure their Young; Or for the Herds convenient Shelter form From the Night-Dews, or Day's pernicious Storm; Or serve for Man, a cool defensive Veil In sultry Hours, and fan th' enlivening Gale. How tall the Fir! and yet his Root is found Spread o'er the Surface of the shallow Ground, To the hard Rock he grows cemented fast, And proudly braves the furious Northern Blast. Where the big Ganges rolls his princely Flood, The Fig-Tree's tow'ring Shade o'erlooks the Wood, Whose lofty Head the Archer's Skill defies, Nor can his fleetest Shaft to pierce it rise. Here, Nightly flowers, in fragrant Blossoms gay, The Nure's fair Tree, that Mourner of the Day: Called upon this Account, Arbor triste de dia. At Sight of whom she sheds her Eve-deck'd Charms, Sinks her sick Head, and folds her sadning Arms. The green Eusada Some of these Trees cover a Thousand Paces in Circuit, and are able to lodge under the Branches Three Thousand Men. springs, on Afric's Soil, A Wood in Breadth, without the Planter's Toil: The far-stretch'd Shoots, that thick its Trunk surround, Bend their Tops, arching, to the Parent-Ground, Whence a new Race, turn'd curving by their Weight, A fresh, and these a following, Crop create: In native Arbours, fenc'd to Sun or Rain, Embowring kindly all that sultry Plain. The Lamb-resembling Plant, Of the Melon Kind; call'd by the Muscovites, Boranetz or Little Lamb, which it resembles in Figure. with Fleeces full, Affords a mimic, vegetable Wool; Warm as that Animals, when us'd undrest, To line from Cold the frozen Russian's Vest. Warm India's Aloe The Aloe Muricata, and Cinnamon-Tree of Ceylon furnish the Indians with Food, Cloth, Oyl, Milk, Wine, Honey, and Materials for Building and Shipping, particulariz'd by Mr. Ray. Wisdom of God. As also by our pious Herbert: ? The Indian Tree alone Is Cloathing, Meat, and Trencher, Drink and Can, Boat, Cable, Sail, and Needle: all in one. yeilds the swarthy Brood Milk, Wine, and Oil, their Cloathing, House, and Food. The wild Priapus The Priapus Vegetabilis holds Bags of Water at the Ends of his Leaves, somewhat like the wild Pine of Jamaica, accurately describ'd by Sir. Hans Sloane, Lowth. Abrid. Phil. Trans. Vol. II. P. 669. here, on arid Plains, In his swoln Leaf, a gelid Lymph contains. And Fountain-Trees The Fountain or dropping-Trees supply the Deficiencies of Springs and Rain in the Island Ferro. their plenteous Streams supply, Where scorching Climes the vital Springs deny; Whose gladding Shades the droughty Pilgrim finds, And quaffs Refreshment thro' their juicy Rhinds. In Troops the thirst-afflicted Insects rove, Sip the cool Draughts, and cheer their pining Drove. Of Trees a numerous Growth each Climate bears, And ev'ry Soil their several Species wears: The Alder in the marshy Ground delights, And the dry Vale the Myrtle's Shade invites; Pale Ash the Mountain's steepy Head o'erlook, And Sallows tremble o'er the gliding Brook; The Ebony in sultry India grows, And hardy Yew thrives best in Scythia's Snows. How well they seem for various Uses made, The Pine for Straightness, and the Beech for Shade! For stately Building we the Cedar prize, And the firm Oak the naval Bark supplies. Ceylonia's spicy Groves their rich Perfume Afford, and Myrrha weeps her od'rous Gum. The pleasing Theme, too copious, I decline, To tell the Product of the useful Vine: Or how, where warmer Climes the Soil improve, Blooms, with perpetual Sweet, the Orange Grove. Here ripening Citrons their Perfection find, And the Pomegranate's rich, transparent Kind. Shou'd I the Orchard's plenteous Growth commend, Where the ripe Boughs with clust'ring Fruitage bend, My Verse might sing the British Apple's Praise; Fam'd in the modern Georgic's Philips's Poem on Cryder. happier Lays. Or, should I, in inferior Strains, assume The shapely Pear to praise, or glossy Plum, The Peach with native Down enwoven o'er, The Mulb'ry purpled with a Lover's Gore: These, liberal Earth thy Blessings might declare, Kind to our Wants with an indulgent Care. Nor less the Water's efficacious Aid, For mutual Ornament and Service made; To purify the Earth's corrupted Stores, And drench with kindly Showers her droughty Pores; Hence all the verdant, vegetable Kind, And Birds, and Beasts, and Men Refreshment find. What Beauties does the rural Landskip take From the clear Fountain, and expansive Lake! Can I forget the smooth relucent Stream, So oft my Solace, and so late my Theme? You cristal Natives of the flow'ry Mead Invite my Walk, and tempt my sportive Reed; Unnumber'd Nations in your Branches play, And fruitful Lands receive you in your Way; You to the Father-Ocean bear his Rains, And from superfluous Moisture free the Plains. In that new World, which Europe's Plunderers keep, Canada flows, unfathomably deep: Among the Race of Floods none fairer shines, Whose Banks her Nymphs adorn with clust'ring Vines. Vast Amazone a Waste of Waters seems, And Oronoque, with his disparted Streams: Where the wild Natives dare their Limbs expose To hunt the Castor o'er the wintry Snows. Largest of Floods the Ganges, where he glides, Bengala's Land in girdled Isles divides; Hung with rich Fruits their Bosoms sweet appear, And blooms, in Flow'rs, the ever-verdur'd Year. The broad Euphrates Asia's Sons may boast, Wide-watering, many a League, his peopled Coast, Where once-fam'd Babylon, its choak'd-up Pass Drowns, in a dreadful, desolate Morass. See fierce Araxes, washing Persia's Soil, In rapid Pace along his Channels boil: Indignant, on the Pontal Curb Pontem indignatus Araxes. Virg. he frowns, And in his Gulphs the ruin'd Fabric drowns. Thro' Afric's Desart-Woods, and firey Sands, The wave-full Niger pours his streaming Bands. There furious Volta, white with foamy Stain, His Torrents empties on the bellowing Main. And, from the Seat of Abyssinian Kings, Huge Nile his fertilizing Currents brings. What have not darker Ages wond'ring read Of its recluse, impenetrable Head? His strange o'erflowing Stream, that spread around With a kind Deluge drowns the teeming Ground; And how, thro' seven wide Mouths, he, rushing steep With deaf'ning Clamours, swells th' inferiour Deep? Of fam'd Eridanus, whose watry Bands Divide, with length'ning Streams, Saturnian Lands? A spacious Course; whence antient Bards devise He pours his ample Urn thro' half the Skies.

Me, Jordan, shall thy hallow'd Name delight, And to rais'd Themes my musing Thoughts invite. What Wonders of thy sacred Stream are told, With Truth inspir'd, renown'd in Songs of old! How Israel's Sons thy dry Foundations Joshua iii. 17. trod, And how the Prophet's Mantle 2 Kings ii. 8. 14. cleav'd thy Flood! King of the watry Family, whose Wave Baptismal Rites to Man's Redeemer gave, When o'er his Head was seen the radiant Dove, And Heav'n approv'd the Deed Luke iii. 6. 21. 22. with Words of Love. Happy the Hermit on thy Banks reclin'd, Who feasts with Dreams inspir'd his raptur'd Mind. Forbear we Ister's spreading Flood to name, The Northern Volga, or the British Thame For happy Shores, and gentle Streams renown'd, With princely Domes, and regal Navies crown'd. How advantageous the surrounding Seas In their wide Tracts to cool the Summer-Breeze! The Ships unwieldy Burthen to sustain, And yeild an easy Passage thro' the Main; With all her rich Embargo swift she rides, Help'd by the Force of Winds, and hast'ning Tides. Thus vastly-distant Lands acquainted grow, And, mutually, commercial Aids bestow. Shall I their strange, exhaustless Treasure sing, How with rais'd Dews they feed the bubbling Spring, Supply the spongy Clouds with Showery Stores, And back receive the Tribute of the Shores? Vast Riches, that the Wealth of Earth outvie, In its hid, solitary Bottom lie. Or tell how the rebellious Deep of old O'er the broad Lands a direful Deluge roll'd, Whose swelling Tides, by angry Heaven employ'd, The World, with all its guilty Race, destroy'd? Say, Muses, how averse to Nature's Laws Such Woe befel, from what stupendous Cause? Some think Des Cartes's Theory improv'd upon by Dr. Burnet, Woodward, and others; whose antiscriptural Account of the Origin of Mountains, reflects very unhappily on the eminent Theorists. ere this nor Sea nor Hill was found, But a smooth Surface cloath'd our Planet round, Till torn by Earthquakes its convexive Shell, Sapp'd by th' imbosom'd Waters, inward fell; When strait th' unbroken Fountains pour'd their Stores, With wide Confusion, and o'ertop'd the Shores: Hence Seas, and Mountains their Formation owe, Relicts of Ruin, and deforming Woe. Others suppose Mr. De la Cross in his Memoirs for the Ingenious. Mr. Ray countenances this Opinion, in part. Miscel.

A Sage Mr. Whiston in his New Theory of the Earth, assigns a Comet as a Cause of the Deluge, which, at that Time, in its Perihelion pass'd very near the Earth's Orbit. The same which since was observed in the Year 1680. This illustrates Kircher's Work De Arca Noæ, that asserts the Rain in the Deluge to be miraculous., deep learn'd in Secrets of the Wise, Reports, a Comet rul'd th' indignant Skies, Whose Atmosphere, a vast collected Train, Might furnish Vapour for th' incessant Rain.

It supposes the Antediluvian World had an external Sea with Land, Mountains, &amp;c. about the Bigness these are of at present: That the subterraneous Caverns and Pillars being broken by Earthquakes, most Part, if not the whole, was swallowed up by the Seas we now have; and the present Earth rose out of the Bottom of the Antediluvian Sea, in its Room, as Islands are now sunk, and others thrust out in their Stead. Hence it is no longer a Wonder that Shells, Shell-Fish, Bones of Fish, Fruits, &amp;c. are found in Beds and Quarries in vastly inland Mountains; for here they bred in the Antediluvian Sea, were elevated with them in the Deluge; fell into, and were buried in Chasms, that would necessarily happen in the thrusting up of the Earth; and are found in the Soil that was flung with Confusion and Violence from one Place to another, by the working of the Waters, and the Ferment and Hurry things were then put into. who different Schemes propose: How from his Channels antient Ocean rose, With all his Floods to fresh Possessions led; And sunk on Earth his new, perpetual Bed; Whence his forsaken Bottom firmer grew, Drain'd by degrees, the present Scene we view. From hence they solve why oft we buried find The Bones of Fish, and their testaceous Kind, Sunk in the settling Ooze, when hurrying Floods Rush'd to new Seats, and chang'd their first Abodes. Long time th' encreasing Waters cover'd o'er The delug'd World, all Ocean robb'd of Shore; When the known Sire, whom Heav'n's Concern to save, In the clos'd Ark indulgent Shelter gave, Loos'd first a Raven on enquiring Wing, That ne'er return'd her Embassy to bring. 'Tis thought the Bird unclean her Hunger fed, And Feet upstaid on the thick-floating Dead. Then by the Dove he fresh Discovery sought, Who a soil'd Branch of dripping Olive brought, Pacific Signal, that distinctly show'd Earth's new Recovery from th' abated Flood. Leave we unsung, the Globe in Ruin hurl'd, And drear, dead Silence of th' unpeopled World: A Scene so sad, Almighty Pity swore The wasteful Waters should prevail no more, When high in Air he plac'd the peaceful Sign, And bad his sacramental Rainbow shine. A milder Horror let the Muse explore, The Northern Ocean, and its gloomy Shore: Where Winters their eternal Stations keep: A dismal Region, and a stormy Deep. Yet, ev'n on those uncultivated Meads, The hardy Stag her numerous Bevy breeds. In Air the Fowls, the Fish in Ocean sport, And vast Leviathan maintains his Court. Here dire A dreadful Whirpool on the Coast of Norway. Maelstroom with horrid Vortex raves, By Sailors deem'd the Navel of the Waves, Suppos'd thro' perforated Earth to flow, Or from some strange Hiatus mov'd below. Not more destructive to the Seaman's Freight Fam'd Scylla, or Ceraunia's antient Strait, Nor Malea's dreary Cape, a fatal Land, Nor where the Syrtes spread their swallowing Sand. Hapless the Bark that, down the Torrent hurl'd, Surveys the Bottom of th' amazing World. And hapless they whom icy Bonds controul, Imprison'd far beneath the freezing Pole, Constrain'd to suffer Winter's Rage severe, And languish out the half-benighted Year. Far otherwise the South's pacific Main, Where never Storm disturbs the glassy Plain, But only breathing Gales are heard to sigh, And brooding Halcyons o'er the Surface fly. Vast Lands unknown his peaceful Seas divide, And universal Ocean joins his Tide. What Muse the strange Inhabitants shall tell, That in the watry World secluded dwell? What undiscover'd Climes, and hidden Coasts, Conceal their new, unnam'd, unnumber'd Hosts? Or who recount the various Plants that grow In liquid Fields, and coral Groves below? O Derham! Britain's fam'd, industrious Sage, Be this the Palm of thy accomplish'd Age; This last, this promis'd Enterprize pursue, Deny'd to Athens, and reserv'd for You The learned World have unhappily lost this great Ornament of it, and probably that Treatise of the Waters, promis'd by him, since the Lines above were first written.. While I new Worlds, and various, led to roam, Launch'd on wide Seas, far-distant from my Home, This Harbour for my little Pinnace seek; A short, sweet Respite in the shelt'ring Creek. Till on my Voyage, with a full-sprung Gale, Refitted, and refresh'd, I trust my Sail. The End of the First Book. BOOK II. Of the Elements of Air and Fire. The Argument. The Subject continued; where the Elements of Air and Fire come last under Review: which together with those of Earth and Water (that compose the former Book) represent the whole Phenomena of Nature observable of our Planet. By the way, more Episodical Descriptions are inserted: Of the memorable Storm, 1703; and of the Destruction of the Cities of the Plain by Fire, recorded Gen. xviii. &amp;c. Lastly, Man, as the chief Inhabitant of this World, is considered in reference to his Capacities and Pleasures, which he is exhorted to the regular, moderate Use of, agreeable to his superiur Faculties, and the Intention of his beneficent Creator. Loos'd (by sweet Rest) more active from the Port, See, the wish'd Winds my swelling Canvas court! And, as they bear my gliding Bark along, From these, I catch a Subject for my Song. Earth's Tracts already, and the wat'ry Plains My Muse has measur'd, in her transient Strains! Shown, in wise Nature's Plan, how each conduce To serve its Ends, of Pleasure and of Use. Next, vital Air! thy Theme demands the Lays; A Gift as bounteous, and as due thy Praise. Capacious Element! that round our Ball, In thy large Trust, upholds the Life of All. Our Earth, without whose animating Breath Would frown in Horror of eternal Death, Nor Plants Plants, as Malphigi discover'd, have respiring Vessels as well as Animals. Insects have more And Fish pass the Air and Water by their Mouths and Gills. Some, as the Dace, Chub, &amp;c. have efflated Air-Bladders., nor Beasts, nor Man's superior Kind Could due Supports of Respiration find. Nor the small Insects mean, unnotic'd Train, Nor numerous Natives of the wat'ry Reign. How apt is thy disseminating Care, The ripen'd Seeds on plumy Wings The Seeds of Dandelion, Anemone, &amp;c. and others of the papous or wingy Kind, have a Tomentum, or light Down, by which they are transported, when ripe, thro' the Air, to distant Places, for Semination. to bear, And, with a lib'ral Distribution, pour On ev'ry teeming Glebe the genial Show'r! Else, too confin'd, the separate Tribes wou'd lie Fix'd to one Soil, nor gen'ral Use supply. Thy friendly Pow'rs the burthen'd Clouds upstay, And bear them round in their prolific Way; Unfold the Blossom on the vernal Plain, And waft its Odours to th' enamour'd Brain. Thy Medium lends the Sight extensive Bound, And taught th' attentive Ear the Sense of Sound; Gives the tun'd Breath its Melody of Song, And thy wide Fields sustain the Feathery Throng. The mounting Lark, the Warblers of the Grove, Safe thro' thy Heights with pleasing Passage rove. The Household Pidgeons here in Troops resort, And in free Plains with circling Motion sport. Here, far upborn with unobstructed Aim, The generous Faulcon tracks the flying Game; While the light Swallow, thro' the yielding Way, On agile Chase pursues her Insect-Prey. From the wild Andes with gigantic Wings, On the prone Herd the mighty Condor springs; And, sometimes, is rapacious seen to wrest The hapless Infant from it's Mother's Breast. In those large Woods, that stretch a boundless Space, Reside the Mock-Birds imitating Race, That, docile, catch the widely-varied Lay, Of ev'ry tuneful Warbler on the Spray. Where the Ourissia The Humming Bird. One of which beautiful little Creatures with its Nest weighs no more than 24 Grains. Bee-like in it's Size, Humming, from Flow'r to Flow'r, delighted flys, And in a wond'rous, living Rainbow drest, Shifts all it's Colours on his Wings and Breast. Here the proud Guara Called by Europeans the Sea-Curlew. The Chevalier des Marchais in his Voyage to Guinea, in 1727, mentions to have seen something there of a like Kind with this famous American Bird, but with this Difference, that it changes from black to red on its first Moulting, then becomes blue, then green, and lastly yellow, retaining his Colours always very lively, and without any Mixture of one with another., gay in tinctur'd Blooms, Decks his sweet Form with metamorphos'd Plumes; In Raven Jet, brown Ash, and snowy White, Then, next, in Crimson robed he tempts the Sight; And, last, in dazzling Scarlet charms the Eye, Which as his Years encrease improves its Die. To Air the Season's grateful Change we owe, And Winds that from divided Quarters blow; The perforating East's dispelling Wing, And Zephyr, Husband of the blooming Spring; Cold Aquilo, replete with gelid Pow'rs, And Ausier, wet with ever-weeping Show'rs. The cheering Dawn, and Twilight's soothing Shade, Are each by its refractive Influence made. This gives the Sky to smile in cheerful Blue, And stains the listed Rainbow's varying Hue, Diversify's the Clouds with Colours gay, And thro' its Depths is shed the golden Day. Nor serve its Regions less the Storm to pour On guilty Realms, in Fate's avenging Hour, Such as of late distrest Britannia felt; O may no recent Stroke pursue her Guilt! A Land to Vice inur'd, a stubborn Land, Ripe for the Weight of Heav'n's vindictive Hand. Scarce had the Night with sable Shades appear'd, Ere in dark Skies the must'ring Winds were heard; First, hoarse and low, the sullen Murmur pass'd, Rose by degrees, and grew with ev'ry Blast. Nought then was heard the Ear to entertain, No Voice of Mirth, nor Music's chearful Strain. But far resounded, thro' the dismal Gloom, The rattling Clamours of the falling Dome, Or the torn Roofs, in Show'rs of dreadful Hall, With hideous Din clos'd ev'ry deaf'ning Gale. Deep Terrour ev'ry trembling Breast amaz'd, And Fear within, still fiercer Tempest rais'd. From ev'ry Eye the downy Slumber fled, And only, Sleep's soft Rule, possess'd the Dead. Then rose aghast the pale adult'rous Pair, Compell'd to kneel in forc'd, distracted Pray'r. The sculking Thief, to nightly Murder prone, Dreads, from the tott'ring Battlement, his own. How diff'rent the religious Face appears! His steadfast Brow an awful Calmness wears. Tow'rd the loud Heav'ns his Eyes expressive roll, And Danger wakes Devotion in his Soul. Then Providence illustrious Tokens gave Of its sure Pow'r, and watchful Care to save See a curious Collection of Letters from all Parts, 8vo. entitled The Storm, written soon after this calamitous Accident, 1703.. Nor cou'd the Land the spreading Storm contain, With equal Fury it assaults the Main. Let, Ediston, thy massy Tow'r declare How fierce the Elemental Conflict there, From the firm Rock thy deep Foundations torn, And to the Seas with total Ruin born. Here the huge Bark unmoor'd, its Tackling lost, By the chaf'd Waves, behold! confus'dly toss'd; Or forc'd with all its Crew, a hapless Band, On the swift-splitting Rock, or burying Sand. There the driv'n Vessels meet, with clashing Weight, And by one Blow, both sink in mingling Fate. How big the Woes of that disastrous Night! Nor ended here—the unrelieving Light But only serv'd Fate's Terrors to disclose, And a dire Scene of opening Horrours rose. Lo! the tall Buildings, late admir'd for Strength, That grac'd, but now, the City's spacious Length, Uncouthly shatter'd shock th' averting Eye, Or, with their Base, in levell'd Ruins lie. On the Sea-Strand the Wreck profusely strow'd Declar'd the Havock of the fatal Flood. The prostrate Groves their faded Honours mourn, Riv'd in the midst, or from their Bottoms torn. Such dire Designs the airy Forces form, When Heav'ns dread Word commands th' assisting Storm To force uprending Tempests from their Caves, To shake the Shores, and heave the wreckful Waves; To dart direct the Light'nings burning Ball, And roll the Thunder thro' th' aërial Hall. Oft from the blighting East the Locust Bands, In swarthy Numbers, shade the vernal Lands. The naked Fields lament the wasteful Drove, The ruin'd Harvest, and the leafless Grove. And oft the South malignant Seasons brings, And sickly Autumns on her burning Wings; When livid Poisons taint her stagnant Breath, With putrid Steams, and Pestilential Death. Then Friendship shuts her hospitable Door, The Tyes of Love, of Nature, bind no more, No more gay Mirth and Melody invite, The Bloom of Beauty can no more delight, O'erspread with wan Disease: at Noon of Day, Loneness and Silence haunt the publick Way. The Babe and Sire, the Tim'rous and the Brave, Bow with one Blow, and fill a mingled Grave. Ethereal Fire! thy Bounties last I praise; Tho' last, yet not inferior, be the Lays. Prolific Parent! Earth, and Sea, and Air, Thro' all their Kinds, thy genial Use declare. Without Thee all would sink in pristine Night, Nor Heat had e'er been known, nor needful Light. How short had Life's too hasty Date been made, Lost in long Sleep, or dull, disabling Shade, Did not thy Taper lend its gentle Ray, And add fresh Hours of artificial Day! Thy glowing Aids correct the wint'ry Air, And wholesome Meals for craving Man prepare. Else had Earth's Regions by th' unpeopling Frost, And Stores of Food to human Use been lost. To Thee his Skill the swarthy Cyclop owes, And Manual Arts from thy Assistance rose. Mysterious Element! whose Seat unknown The Source of ev'ry vital Power we own. Some in the central Womb of Earth report Thou hold'st obscure thy deep impervious Court. And some thy native Residence convey To Solar Regions, and the Worlds of Day. How vaste! how wide an Empire dost thou know, Planets, and Suns above, and Earth below! Nature by constant gravitating Laws Each Body to her downward Center draws: But thine on new, on different Rules depends, Mocks her Restraints, and retrograde ascends. Strange Chymist! whose discriminating Art Can the remotest Seeds of Things impart, Unfold their Texture, and their Forms disclose; The Solid fracture, the Disjoin'd compose. Discordant Things, that widely disagree, Are all united and commix in Thee. To thy pure Essence all converted turn, And simple Flame, without Distinction, burn, In Thee what wond'rous Contradictions meet, Heat oft devoid of Light, and Light of Heat! Thus glow the liquid Mineral's kindled Veins, Yet dark and hid its lucid Seed remains. Mark otherwise the Glow-Worm's living Light, Whose beamy Tail with Radiance gilds the Night, A harmless Fire: or wand'ring Whisp, that strays, A gelid Flame, thro' Fenns and wat'ry Ways. Who views not oft the Meteor shot from far With trailing Light, a fancy'd Falling Star. Whose seeming Fire, propell'd from nether Skies, A cold, delusive, vap'rous Jelly lies? Behold the North Aurora's flashing Light, A new Phenomenon, how strangely bright! Yet, all devoid of Heat, the bursting Rays Are found a lambent, inoffensive Blaze. Unlike to these the Lightning's forky Gleam, That burns and blazes in a mixt Extreme, Intensest Pow'rs of Light and Heat conjoin'd; To Cattle dangerous, and th' unshelter'd Hind. Why shou'd I sing of Mountains, that expire From their torn Entrails Floods of sulph'rous Fire, Which o'er whole Cities At Catanea in Sicily, in digging for Pumice-Stones, they find, at the Depth of 68 Feet, Streets pav'd with Marble, and other Footsteps of Towns which have been o'erwhelm'd in former Ages by the Eruptions of Etna. In 1669, it overwhelm'd 14 Towns and Villages in the upland Country, where it had never made any Devastations before; even as no Sign is left where such Towns were, only the Church and Steeple of one, which stood alone on a high Ground, still appear. The whole Island of Sorea in the Molucca Islands was in danger of being swallowed by a Firey-Lake proceeding from a Volcano there, 1693, which occasion'd the Inhabitants to desert it, leaving their Effects and Moveables behind them. The Mountain upon Banda has cast so many Stones (some 6 Feet long) as to cover a great Part of the Island; and the Sea, which there has been 40 or 50 Fathoms deep, is fill'd up near the Shore, and appears as a dry Beach many Fathoms high above the Water. See Lowth. Abridg. Phil. Transact. Vol. II. pour their scorching Train, And mark in lengthen'd Paths the furrow'd Main? Thus Etna, thus Vesuvius, (antient Names) For ever burn, and oft project their Flames. Ev'n frozen Hecla A burning Mountain in Iceland., mid perpetual Snows, With the same Rage, a dread Volcano glows, Whose bursting Mouths like loudest Thunder roar, And strew with Ruins the deserted Shore. Shall I of Horror sing? a mournful Tale, Might flinty Breasts with shiv'ring Dread assail? How Heav'n, provok'd by Crimes of monstrous Size, Rain'd Showers of Sulphur from th' avenging Skies, Which the doom'd Cities, and their impious Crew, At once, with instantaneous Waste o'erthrew; A Monument of Wrath: where still remain The Lake accurs'd, and solitary Plain. In antient Times (believe the sacred Tale) Where Horror now deforms the blasted Vale, A happy People dwelt; the fruitful Soil Was rich in Vineyards, and profuse of Oyl. Here fam'd Engedi fragrant Clusters gave, And limpid Jordan led his wand'ring Wave. Had not by monst'rous Guilt the daring Age Their Land prophan'd, and urg'd th' Almighty Rage, Still might their ruin'd Tow'rs, and branded Name, Have proudly stood, and shone adorn'd in Fame. But neither Nature, nor divine Command, A gentle Climate, nor a fruitful Land, Could the ungenerous Race from Crimes reclaim, Crimes! Thought abhors, and Verse detests to name. One only Man, a Worth unmatch'd and rare, Preserv'd his Virtue from the public Snare: With manly Shame and Anguish inly warm, Beheld the Guilt, he knew not to reform. Yet interposing oft, the Sire distrest With such Complaint his anxious Speech address'd. “O Men! to more than brutal Vice debas'd, “Unfitly with the Human Title grac'd, “Rather dire Monsters of th' Abyss below, “For sure 'tis only there such Guilt could grow, “Look to yon Skies, those Heights immense and fair; “Speak they not some dread Pow'r that governs there? “Taste not yourselves the Bounties of his Hand? “Who crowns your Seasons? who defends your Land? “Too much that Heav'n must want its Honours due: “Will ye err worse, and put off Nature too? “Nature complains, your Guilt of matchless Size “Strikes at her Being, and alarms her Cries. “Trace her wide Round, Earth, Seas, and Air sublime; “Is there a Semblance of your daring Crime? “Think of your Country, and her Wrongs repair, “Your relative Regards, the Names you bear, “Men, Husbands, Fathers,—venerable Names; “Redeem their Honours, and fulfil their Claims. “Restore the nuptial Dignity, restore “To slighted Age, the Reverence once it bore, “To Parents Piety, the Injur'd Laws, “To Vice the Rod, to Virtue due Applause; “And, ah! to Heav'n its sacred Rights restore “Ere this, so oft provok'd, relent no more. How hard the vicious Habit to erase, Fond of the Sin, and blind to the Disgrace! Heav'n long beheld, yet long delay'd the Blow, To succour speedy, to avenge how slow! The Hour was come, reserv'd for heavier Doom, At once the Guilt and Guilty to consume. Lo, from the parting Skies a radiant Pair, On sudden Wing, the dire Commission bear. Near the ill-destin'd Walls unseen they light, Their Forms conceal'd, and chang'd to human Sight. The Shape of beauteous Youths they strait assume, Soft wav'd their curling Hair, and fresh their Bloom. In the thick Concourse they promiscuous join, And wait the Hour to act the dread Design. Mean time th' Almighty Sheckinah repairs To flow'ry Hebron, bent on gracious Cares To find the faithful Patriarch, and disclose The fated Nation's soon-approaching Woes, The last Extreme of Mercy to essay, And on indulgent Terms their Doom delay. Now on the destin'd Tow'rs aspiring Height The setting Sun display'd his parting Light; Those Tow'rs, that must no more reflect his Rays, But quickly shine in one consuming Blaze. 'Twas now, releas'd from the Restraints of Day, The Sons of Uproar throng the public Way. Some for long future Times their Thoughts employ, And form vain Schemes of distant guilty Joy. Ah! ignorant of Heaven's severe Decree, Nor Joy hast thou to know, nor Day to see! Ere the next Sun thy Ruin must begin, Exemplar, as thy strange, unequal'd Sin. But pensive Lot, with pious Cares distrest, His homeward Steps with hasten'd Pace address'd. Patient his Ear endur'd the scoffing Throng, Nor in the publick felt his private Wrong. Sad as he pass'd, the Angel-Pair surprize The heedful Sire, and fix his wond'ring Eyes. He mark'd the Stranger-Youths, their sober Air, And noble Grace; then sigh'd with inward Care. “Ah hapless, to so ill a Place betray'd! “Accept (He faintly spoke) my friendly Aid. “Perhaps you know not our detested Crimes? “Happy were more like you to bless the Times! “Beneath my fost'ring Roof remain conceal'd, “Till Morn's Approach your safe Departure yield.” Unwillingness they feign, till, deeply prest, They yield, compliant, to his urg'd Request. Scarce would the short, unfinish'd Hour afford To taste the Bounties of his frugal Board, Ere from without tumultuous Clamours sound, And a rude Rout the threatned Gate surround. The careful Host a thousand Offers tries, Nor ev'n his Daughters in exchange denies; Forgetting all their Sex's tender Shame, And the white Honours of their Virgin Name, Such was the pious Father's strange Intent, By the less Guilt the greater to prevent. When strait th' Immortals interpose their Pow'r, And bent to punish, in a timely Hour, Upon their visual Nerve Disorder threw, And falsify'd each Object to their View. Blinder in Soul, by Judgments harden'd more, Madly thy rage, and still attempt the Door. Astonish'd Lot, with boding Thoughts possess'd, Ken'd the bright Youths, for now they shone confess'd. Their Deed declar'd 'em heavenly, and engage In low Prostrations the religious Sage. Whom with a fixt and earnest Brow they view, And kind bespoke—in Words abrupt and few. “We warn Thee hence—fly, Man approv'd, with speed, “Heav'n has by us thy Country's Doom decreed. “Nor question—nor delay”—The Sire afraid, Bow'd, and in haste th' unquestion'd Charge obey'd. Strait the red Skies at once indignant lour, And big with Wrath the flaming Tempest pour. Sudden as Light'nings thro' the Ether gleam, Bursts the ripe Vengeance, an incessant Stream. But, oh! what mortal Genius can avail To close the Horrors of th' unequal'd Tale! The Looks aghast with Dread, the pale Surprize, The throbbing Anguish, and despairing Cries. Horrors that mock the Thought, too faint to show What the least Pang of that prodigious Woe. Lo, deep within the bedded Mine are seen The Hoards of Fire, a dreadful Magazine, The Nitrous Trains, the Sulphur's sleeping Stores, And Naptha that th' imprison'd Flame explores.

No less than 54 Cities felt the Calamities of the late Earthquake in the Island of Sicily in the Year 1692–3, by which 59693 Persons were destroyed: In the same Year 2000 perish'd by the same Accident in Jamaica. Tremendous Element! whose spreading Sway Earth's inmost Depths, and Orbs remote obey, Thy awful Forces, in the last dire Hour, Shall universal Nature's Strength o'erpow'r. As once the Floods prevail'd, so Heav'ns Decree Ordains her grand Catastrophe by thee. What Reverence shou'd th' impressive Truth inspire! What Virtues raise! a World dissolv'd in Fire! A Scene how awful! when the cracking Frame, Sea, Earth and Skies shall sink in mingling Flame. Then ev'ry Work in Judgment shall be brought; Ponder, ye Sons of Guilt, th' awak'ning Thought! Its Woes to shun, its Terrors to subdue, Live with the solemn Certainty in view. O Man! supine and vain! how basely low Thy Mind is fall'n, inconscious of thy Woe! Slave to the meanest Passion, Folly, Sense, Thy Reason blind, and Freedom, weak Pretence, Where are they flown? thy native noblest Boast? On sordid Cares, and vicious Pleasures lost. Some, mad with Pride, or blind in sensual Night, Reject, impure, the heavenly Christian Light, Learn the dark Systems of the Sceptic Schools, And sit degraded in the Form of Fools. Some to their Idol Gold a Homage pay, Some dream their soft, luxurious Hours away. Th' adjusted Dress, the Compliment, the Ball, The Play, the trifling Visit, waste 'em all. O tear the Films from thy distemper'd Eyes, Dare to be manly, virtuous, good and wise. Shun the lewd Friend, the Oath, the Jest prophane, Mirth of the Thoughtless, Profligate and Vain. The Drunkard's Revel, Gamester's Lure, evade, And Harlot's Haunt, the shameless Masquerade: The Atheist, Ravisher, and Ruffian there. (Fit Emblem of th' infernal Gloom) repair. Nor, by the fashionable Parties won, With their mean Taste to senseless Pastimes run, Ne'er, in a Canine, wanton Waste of Blood, Let thy Gun spoil the Music of the Wood. Nor thy free Steed, admir'd for Strength, and Grace, On needless Speed strain, madly, in the Race. Nor in the Butchery of the Chace engage; That low Diversion of a barbarous Age. Can the soft Heart humane, the polish'd Mind In Sport so cruel, e'er a Pleasure find? Or the fair Breast, to native Pity prone, By such Delights, their tender Sex disown? Let the wild Kinds, by Nature, savage bred: The Wealth-spoil'd Rustic, of unthinking Head, That feels no Bliss but what Disorder gives, Nor boasts to know but that he sleeps, and lives, Let such the Forest-Innocents annoy, And with Destruction edge their brutal Joy. Are these, Companions worthy of thy Kind! Are these Amusements for a reasoning Mind Man's Pleasures from that nobler Source should rise; Not what blind Passions, or wrong Modes advise. Distrust the Joys in vain Allurements plac'd, False is the Relish of the fev'rish Taste. Virtue and Happiness are both the same, They only differ in Degree and Name. Behold! Philosophy thy Choice invites, How safe a Guide, how blameless her Delights! Where e'er we fix or turn our wond'ring Eyes, Around, on ev'ry Side, what Objects rise! A Field of Contemplation meets our View, For ever pleasing, innocent, and new. Fear not thro' all her harmless Maze to stray, 'Tis hard to err where Wisdom leads the Way. No Monsters haunt, no Plagues infest the Air, The Dangers, we engage, we carry there. When Vice to low and base Delights persuades, Retire, and lose her in these purer Shades. What Anger, Envy, &amp;c. can torment his Breast, whom not only the greatest and noblest Objects, but every Sand, every Pebble, every Grass, every Fly can divert? To whom the Returns of every Season, every Month, every Day do suggest a Circle of most pleasing Reflections? Sprat's Hist. of Roy. Societ. p. 345.

Thus wou'd I pass my unambitious Days, Admire my Maker's Works, and sing his Praise. And, if unblam'd my fond Desires might plead, A little Cottage on the lonely Mead Shou'd be my Choice; refresh'd by silver Floods, By Hills surrounded, and obscur'd by Woods.

The End of the Second Book. BOOK III. A Survey of the Planetary Worlds. The Argument. A Commendation of Solitude and a Country Life. When the Subject proceeds, from a Survey of Earth, to consider the Planets which compose our System; where their Theory is summarily given with that of the Comets: And from a View and Comparision of their Physical Resemblances to our World, arise some Arguments in proof of their being inhabited: where the several Objections against it are also fully answered. From hence an occasion is taken to celebrate the Praise of Astronomy, with respect to its Discoveries, Improvements, Use, and Excellency. O Solitude! blest State of Life below, Friend to our Thought, and Balm of all our Woe; Where Lust no Objects for his Fires can gain, And Pride wants Gazers to admire her Train; Where Want no Cravings feels, no Insults bears, Kind Lethe of our Passions and our Cares; Far from the Burse, from Courts and Levees far, The crouded Theatre, and wrangling Bar, O! far from Cities my Abode remove, To Realms of Innocence, and Peace, and Love. Thus liv'd the Patriarchal Race of old, Kings of the verdant Plain, and fleecy Fold; By Angels honour'd, visited, caress'd, Nor seldom with th' Almighty-Converse blest. Thus liv'd th' illustrious Roman, who prefer'd To royal Power his Plow and abject Herd, Refus'd the Scepter of the World to wield, And left the Throne to till his native Field. How sweet the lab'ring Rustic's wholesome Toil, The Flocks to tend, or dress the willing Soil! To mend the Fences, or to mow the Plain, Or in full Sheaves to bind the ripen'd Grain! Here Philomel, unlike the warbling Throng, At Evening, tunes her sweetly-mournful Song; The watching Shepherd oft her Strains delight And lonely Angler in the Summer-Night. Sweet Bird of Darkness, from thy neighb'ring Bow'r Cheer with thy Note, my still, nocturnal Hour! Hail Night! whose Shade the sleeping World entombs, Mother of Silence and lethargic Glooms, Thy grateful Slumbers sooth the troubled Mind, Best Solace of afflicted Human-Kind. Welcome thy mild Returns; I love to muse, Wrapt in thy Shades, and breathe thy humid Dews. Thy Glooms the upper Worlds of Light display, Hid in the fiercer Glare of dazzling Day; His Season lures to Earth our grov'ling Eyes, Thine lifts 'em upward, and unlocks the Skies. Lo! all above, the pure, cerulean Height Is spangled o'er, with pendant Orbs of Light; That seem like Sparks to stud th' ethereal Blue: A Train innumerous to the wond'ring View. Six chiefly bear the Planetary Name, And one entire, harmonious System frame. These round the Sun, their common Centre, roll, And reach at distant Times their annual Goal; Those nearer, gravitate with swifter Pace, Small are their Globes, and shorter is their Race, While those remote, a Bulk, still larger show; Their Orbits wider, and their Pace more slow. First, verging on the lucid Fount of Day, Bright Mercury Mercury is about two thirds of the Earth's Magnitude, near 32 Millions of Miles distant from the Sun, and 88 Million from us. He moves round it in something less than 88 Days, with the Velocity of about 100 Thousand Miles an Hour, which is almost as swift again as the Earth's Motion. directs his circling Way, In three short Months he rounds the Solar Sphere, His Seasons shifts, and ends his transient Year. Next Venus, Venus is nigh the Bigness of the Earth, distant from the Sun near 60 Million of Miles; her diurnal Revolution is in about 23 Hours; her annual 224 Days; her Motion in an Hour about 70 Thousand Miles. She never recedes above 48 Degrees from the Sun, whose Light and Heat is there 4 times as great as with us. matchless in her brilliant Light, (Who seems the lesser Cynthia of the Night) Her Orbit measures round the station'd Sun; And double Time requires her Race to run. Lo! in the midst, fair Earth, Next to Venus is the Orbit of the Earth (with that of the Moon.) Her Distance from the Sun is (Mr. Locke computes) 81 (others) 90 Millions of Miles. annual Revolution 365 Days, 5 Hours, 49 Minutes. our native Seat, And her attendant Moon their Course compleat. And higher, see! in twice our annual Space. Revolving Mars Mars is much less than our Earth, distant from the Sun 123 Millions of Miles, revolves round him in 687 Days nearly, at the Rate of 45 Thousand Miles an Hour. His Light and Heat are twice, sometimes thrice, less than we receive from the Sun., conclude his larger Race. Then Jove Jupiter is distant from the Sun 424 Millions of Miles, round which he revolves in 11 Years and 10 Months, at the Rate of 24 Thousand Miles an Hour., prodigious Planet of the Skies! His Orb presents; of huge amazing Size, None equals his immense, enormous Mass, The whole, joint System's his Contents surpass. On Earth twelve Years their Date compleatly close, Ere his, one finish'd Revolution knows. View Saturn Saturn, the last Planet in our System, is distant from the Sun 777 Million of Miles; his annual Revolution is in 29 Years, 138 Days, his hourly 18 Thousand Miles, he is about 94 times as big as our Earth. last, how faint his distant Gleam! Remotest Planet in our Solar Scheme; Tho' vast his Globe (so large his Orbit's Space.) Our Thirty Years but show his annual Race. Above, appear the Comets The Comets are a kind of Temporary Planets, revolving in determined Periods round the Sun, only visible to us in their Perihelion, or nearest Approach; they are generally of the Size of the Planets, and have Atmospheres like our Earth, tho' more dense and thick: They sometimes appear very large; that in the Time of Nero, Seneca relates, was not inferior in Magnitude to the Sun itself; that in 1652, Hevelius observes, was as large as the Moon. They move in Elliptical Orbits, extremely excentric, insomuch that many Astronomers maintain their Courses are Rectilinear; hereby their Nearness and Distances from the Sun are such, that their greatest to the smallest Degree of Light and Heat differ so much as to be above 400 Millions of times to 1. The irregular and various Motions of Comets have confirmed these three great Points, viz. that there are no such solid Orbs as the Ptolemaic System imagin'd, no Vortices, or fluid Whirlpools, as Des Cartes maintain'd, and that the Planets move in a perfect Vacuum without any resisting Matter., devious Train, Still slower moving thro' th' elliptic Plane. Five hundred Years with us their Round repeat, Ere some their tedious Period can compleat. Unknown their Number, as their Use unknown, But found vast Orbs, erratic like our own. Not, as blind Antients The Peripatetics. taught, meer Meteors all, Exhal'd and rang'd beneath the Lunar Ball. No Ills portentous, as the Vulgar hold, Th' unusual Visitors to Earth unfold, Tho' with red Trains their kindled Disks appear: Cause of vain Doubt, and superstitious Fear. How dense a Compound must their Globes require, Whole Ages chill'd with Frosts, or scorch'd with Fire! Whether, to distant Suns by turns convey'd, Far Systems they supply with secret Aid? Or Worlds they be, to Conflagration doom'd (As once must ours) on their last Pyre consum'd? Or dolorous Mansions serve of penal Woe? Too vainly curious, we aspire to know. These Planetary Orbs, these Seats unknown, Perhaps, are Earths, all furnish'd like our own. Else say, morose Disputer! why so small, So distant plac'd from this terraqueous Ball? If only for its nightly Use design'd, If form'd alone to serve our single Kind, Why oft do Clouds obscure their total Light? Or why retire they As is the Case especially of Mercury, whose Proximity to the Sun, never receding more than 28 Degrees, makes him seldom discernable. from th' enquiring Sight? What gives the optic Christal to descry Myriads of Orbs, that 'scape the naked Eye? Instanc'd in Jupiter's and Saturn's Moons, the Galaxy, or Milky Way, whose strange Whiteness is found to proceed from the vast Number of small Telescopic Stars: As in the Pleiades, or little Constellation of 7 Stars (as they are call'd) more than 70 have been counted. And farther still a new Discovery trace Thro' the deep Circle of uncompass'd Space? Wou'd Wisdom infinite such Works produce, Design such Labours, and prevent their Use? Wou'd HE, who no mean Atom The Scriptures speak of God as making all Things in Number, Weight and Measure, weighing the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Balance. forms in vain, Such useless Trophies of his Pow'r ordain, When a few Moons The Light of all the Stars put together does not amount to above a 10th Part of the Moon's Light. might brighter Influence lend, And by an easier Means effect his End? No, Man deceiv'd! to partial Views confin'd, In nobler Thoughts extend thy straiten'd Mind; And follow, while th' ethereal Muse descries Worlds yet unsung, unview'd by vulgar Eyes. Mark those bright Wand'rers, that their Courses run With Earth, attendant on th' imperial Sun: Like is their Form, their Furniture the same, Resembling her's in Motion, Bulk and Frame. All like Exchange of Seasons Observable in Saturn particularly, whose Axis inclines to the Place of the Ecliptic above 31 Degrees, which is 8 more than is in ours. undergo, And Days and Nights Venus, Mars, the Earth, and Jupiter, it is certain, have diurnal Revolutions. in due Succession know; Surrounded with an Atmosphere That Venus, Mars and Jupiter have Atmospeeres is indisputable: As, from the Observation of solar Eclipses, some Astronomers conceive the Moon to have; tho' different from ours. of Air, And Clouds discharge The Spots in Jupiter and Mars are a Proof of this, by their dark Colour, continual Change, and frequent Dissipation. their treasur'd Meteors there: Strong Intimation that some Creature Race The beauteous. habitable Mansions grace. Else for what End thus furnish'd? wherefore made? Not merely our benighted Globe to aid. For then why hides the close Mercurial Star His bashful Head, beneath the Solar Car? On Earth how rarely view'd; immerg'd in Day.— Why flitts so fast the Cyprian Star away To tend her radiant Lord? Illustrious Queen! Whose Orb has oft in Noon's full Shine This is only observable when the Earth is in her Peribelion, and Venus in her inferior Conjunction with the Sun, at which time she is 6 times nearer to us than in her superior Conjunction. When we behold her with this delightful Brightness, a fourth Part of her Disk only appears enlighten'd thro' the Telesepe, and she is then horned like our New-Moon. Mr. De la Hire observed in the inner Part of her Crescent a Train of very high Rocks, that he thinks contribute greatly to this extraordinary Lustre. been seen. Sparkling and vivid, in her Eve-lov'd Hour, Her dancing Rays their soft Effulgence pour. Yet soon she leaves our wishing View, to rise On Day-light Plains, obscur'd in lucid Skies. Tell me (if all the Planets serve to wait Attendants, merely on terrestrial State) Proud Boaster, tell! so seldom why appear Bright Mercury's or Saturn's paler Sphere? Waste they the Light design'd for us alone? How is Heav'n's Care employ'd, or Wisdom shown? What needed Jove such Width of spacious Plains? Two hundred Earths Jupiter is about 220 times bigger than the Earth, which is more than equal in Bulk to all the Planets put together. his single Orb contains. Had Fate design'd him our Attendant Ball, Why shines he plac'd so high, his Light so small? No; for more Honour made, behold afar Four radiant Moons surround th' imperial Star, Large as our boasted World; whose silver Light His Regions visit in the Gloom of Night. Nor this the Fancy of deluded Eyes; Mark'd are their Periods thro' sublimer Skies. Oft does th' Astronomer his Tube display, And view 'em, in Eclipse, with pleas'd Survey, To this the curious Genius Knowledge owes Of Light's swift Motion, and its Measure By Observations made from the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites, the Motion of Light was first calculated and demonstrated by Mr. Romer. Mr. Huygens observes, that a Bullet discharged from a Cannon would be 25 Years in coming from the Sun to us, whereas the Rays of Light (which is a Body too) arrive in 7 Minutes and a half of Time. knows. Why roll these vast Satellites? why attend Their spacious Orb, and kindly Influence lend? Why were they form'd?—to shine on barren Strands, On rocky Wastes, and void unpeopled Lands? On lifeless Meads to play with wasted Beams, And glimmer o'er a length of useless Streams? Too small their far-fixt Globes, too weak their Ray, To reach our Confines thro' the distant Way, Hid from past Ages, and a Secret still But for the modern Artist's Galileo. abler Skill. The shining Orbs, we well infer from hence, To other Worlds their Virtues must dispense; Or only stand vain Marks of Pow'r unwise, Perplexing Error of the burthen'd Skies. Far hence, ye Thoughts profane, with Rev'rence bow, And the great Maker's sapient Work allow. But look we on to Saturn's out-most Star, Whose Beams remote but faintly reach so far. Ev'n here th' assisted Eye with pleas'd Amaze A fresh Supply of Lunar Orbs surveys. The weaken'd Sight can only five attain; For new Discovery others may remain. Some fam'd Observers, with Suspicion This was the Opinion of Mr. Huygens and Dr. Harris. Between the 4th and 5th of Saturn's Satellites (say they) there is a Distance not at all proportionable to that between all the others, where may probably be a 6th Moon, or perhaps another may lie without the 5th, which yet may have escaped us. Cosmotheo. p. 114 Ast. Dial. p. 133. strong Deem that more Moons to this fair World belong. These in the Planet's sad, benighted Hour, From different Quarters, their Refulgence pour, Light his huge Plains, or in Eclipses view'd May teach his Sailor needful Longitude, While their joint gravitating Force presides To swell, and sink by turns, his monstrous Tides. Muse, raise thy Voice mysterious Truth to sing: How o'er the copious Orb a lucid Ring, Opake and broad, is seen his Arch to spread, Round the big Globe at stated Periods led; Perhaps (its Use unknown) with gather'd Heat To warm the Regions of that gelid Seat, The want of nearer Phœbus to supply, And fill with reflex Beams his Summer Sky, Else might the high-plac'd World, expos'd to Frost, Lie waste, in one eternal Winter lost. And why in Life's Behalf such needless Care, If no created Race inhabits there? If only made to shine for Earth below, Vain is the Light his circling Moons bestow: Unserviceable here; how vain a Thing! Vain the Convenience of his radiant Ring, Entirely vain; as bright his Beams would show, Tho' stript of these, or bound in endless Snow. That Heav'n with Choice of animated Births, May have enrich'd like us the Sister-Earths; These Moons, in the Positions they appear, New Arguments suggest, in Reason's Ear. Those two, near Neighbours to the Solar Light Mercury and Venus., Want no such Solace, in their gloom-less Night. Or want they? each, so splendant and so nigh, Aids may to each, reciprocal, supply. While Earth, that farther from the Sun recedes, The friendly Rays of one Satellite needs, If, haply, none to Mars allotted fall, Shall one lost Proof enerve the Strength of all? Ours, or the Moons of Jove may light his Skies; And less Degrees his Planet's Wants suffice. Whose Axis shows him (different from the Rest) With Length, unchang'd, of Summer-Radiance The Axis of Mars having very little or no Inclination to the Plane of his Orbit (as the Motion of his Spots discover) shows no perceivable Variation of Seasons there, and that there is little sensible Difference of Summer and Winter in that Planet. blest. Jove, more remote, four large-orb'd Moons obtains; Five, dimmer Saturn, to illume his Plains, Wins not such pleading Evidence the Mind? That indicates a Care so wise! so kind! If chance-like-Pow'r, Heav'n's Vault dispers'd them o'er, Why had Jove these? or why not Venus four? So well proportion'd, by a proper Lot, In Number, Magnitude, and Place!—for what? ‘For nothing‘—the obdurate Wrangler cries, Or means, who Consequence so plain denies. But, let th' Objector, unconvinc'd, disclose His various Doubts, and all their Force oppose. Some fancy, shou'd the Planetary Train A Race of living Animals contain, Those fixt in Mercury's too splendid Seat Must sink, opprest beneath the fervid Heat Which is there (Dr. Harris thinks seven, Mr. Huygens) nine Times as great as our hottest Summer, and is supposed sufficient to make Water boil. His Fluids and other Parts must be dense in Proportion, or the Sun would ratify them so as to make them (it is believed) all pass off in Fume and Vapour.; Or by too strong a Ray, the tortur'd Sight Fail, quite o'erpower'd with unabating Light. Or, if superior Planets we prefer, High Jove's, or Saturn's large, extremest Star, What Hercules enflam'd, as Fables tell, Could in their mildest Climes attempt to dwell. On whose Equator, Snows perpetual lie, And ev'n our dreaded Poles their Heat outvie The Solar Light and Heat which Jupiter receives, is but a 27th (Dr. Keil says a 25th) Part of what we enjoy. In Saturn the Sun appears 100 times less than we see him, and both his Light and Heat are diminished in the same Proportion. His warmest Regions are therefore more frigid than our coldest.? Allow we this, what Disputants maintain, Nor will it render our Opinion vain. The same of us might the Mercurials hold, “A Planet uninhabitably cold;” And those reverse in Saturn's icy Seat Suppose us burnt with more than Ætna's Heat, Each by their World comparing ours, might deem Their Reasons firm, and err in wide Extreme. From Mercury we seem a far Remove, Far as from Earth appears the Orb of Jove. Perhaps the highest Star his Systems own, Alars, Jove, and Saturn may be, there, unknown, While we Saturnian-like, to him may seem; Just dimly lighted by Day's faintest Gleam. Perhaps from Jupiter's remoter Ball Scarce are we view'd, or not discern'd at all The Earth observ'd from Jupiter, never departing above 11 Degrees from the Sun, which is not so much as half Mercury's greatest Elongation with us, may, as Dr. Keil observes, “make the Sight of it (even there) a strange and unusual Spectacle,” and to answer in some respect what he conjectures of the Saturnian Astronomers “that perhaps they may not have yet discovered that there is such a Body as our Earth in the Universe.”, Unless the poring Sage, empower'd by Art, The rare believ'd Discovery can impart. His Mercury our fiery Planet seems, Burnt in th' o'er-fervid Suns too neigh'bring Beams. And yet our Earth a temperate Seat we find; No ever-during Frosts the Furrows bind, Nor burning Desart lies our wasted Plain, Tho' deem'd unpeopled, by Conjecture vain. Suppose a Native of the briny Flood, Who ne'er on Earth beheld our living Brood, Cou'd reason thus;—“This Element I view, “Sure never Race of breathing Creatures knew “Too thin a Region; in so purg'd a Sky “How can the Lungs their labouring Tubes supply? “Starv'd in Vacuity; my Medium yields “Substantial Air, and more commodious Fields.” Th' Objection shou'd the watry Kind rehearse, Or we on them the Argument reverse, Each, to themselves apt Reasoning might appear; And serve, in our Debate, as aptly here. But say, how know we the Mercurial Shore With Wastes and fiery Plains lies cover'd o'er? The Antients, while the World was scarcely known, Fram'd like Conceptions of our torrid Zone. By later Ages found a peopled Land, Cool'd by vast Rains, by constant Breezes fann'd. And who can tell but Solar Clouds may aid Mercurial Skies, and yield a gelid Shade? Or lend him Intervals of milder Light? Or help his Seasons in their circling Flight? Oft are they seen to maculate the Sun, And round his Globe perpetual Courses run, Succeeded still by new, as these retire, Mysterious Exhalations from his Fire. Who knows that Jove with endless Frosts is bound? Swift to the Sun he turns his Planet round Jupiter is observ'd to have perpetual Equinoxes, and the Interchanges of Day and Night successively every five Hours., Forbidding Night's long Stay to freeze his Air, And soon regains the Sun-beams mild Repair. The countervailing Day his Glebe may warm With genial Seeds, and Winter's Force disarm. Ev'n utmost Saturn, tho' he views from far The less'ning Sun diminish'd to a Star The apparent Diameter of the Sun, seen from Saturn, will be little more than twice the Diameter of Venus, when nearest the Earth., But feebly glimm'ring on his dusky Ball, With Light and Heat proportionably small, May from his Ring Amends of each receive, Or by a length of Day the Loss relieve. But let th' Objection stand—These Orbs suppose Scorch'd with hot Rays, or chill'd by prisoning Snows: No doubt th' Almighty cou'd his Worlds replete With Creatures, suited to their various Seat, Intense Degrees of Cold or Heat to bear, Of Light, or Gloom, a pleasing, proper Share, To them agreeable, by Nature blest, Painful, howe'er, imagin'd, to the rest. Of this on Earth Similitude we find; Each Place to fit Inhabitants assign'd. The Bird of Jove, with an undazzled Sight, Kenns the clear Sun, and towers to reach his Light; Whilst the benighted Bat, and Owl obscene, Attend the Chariot of the shadowy Queen. Upward the Feathery Nations all repair, And range at large th' extensive Fields of Air; To firmer Earth the grosser Kinds adhere, And wat'ry Realms the finny Natives cheer. The Ant and Mole their downward Courses guide, And, deep intrench'd, a gloomy Race, reside. And Bees their artful Palaces contrive In the close Cavern of their darksome Hive. Pleas'd, to his destin'd Mansion each is prone, Form'd best to suit, and best approve his own. But leave we Worlds that less conspicuous shine, And to the Moon our nearer Search confine. Here obvious Mountains rise with lofty Head These are larger in Proportion than ours. Their Tops gilded by the Sun appear as so many bright Specks up and down, a considerable Time before the darker Interspaces, which are the Valleys, become enlightened., And Seas and Lakes in wide Dimensions spread. “Or do those Spots, that shade the lucid Ball, “With deepning Caverns in its Surface fall? “Whence the dense Soil unwater'd, cleft, and dry, “One waste, unpeopled lonesome Rock must lie.” Weak Doubt! inseperate from the human Fool, That SELF wou'd make the fixt, unvarying Rule: As if an Atmosphere, more thin and pure, No Plant could stand, no Animal endure; As if, (allow no Clouds those Regions fill) Dews might not, imperceptibly, distil. Perhaps, did, there, extensive Oceans flow, Rul'd by one common Cause with ours below, Too strong a Gravity might Earth impel, And their vast Tides in Deluges o'erswell. Least Planet of the Skies, yet view'd so near The Moon being in our Neighbourhood (distant but 60 Semi-Diameters of the Earth, which make two hundred thirty nine Thousand and ten Miles) her Diameter is nearly the same with the Sun's apparent Diameter, yet is in reality not above a fortieth Part of the Earth's bigness., How large her Size! how bright her Beams appear! Thus meaner Virtues, to advantage plac'd, Shine, oft, with a superior Lustre grac'd. Nor shall we this our fair Satellite find For Earth's meer ornamental Use design'd: Wise Heav'n intended 'em, with friendly Aid, By turns to shine, for mutual Service made. If in our Night her splendid Rays she pours, We silver o'er her Plains in gloomy Hours; Her larger Moon, increasing as she wains, And full our Orb, when hers a Crescent gains. Thrice five times brighter Influence we display, Light scarce inferiour to a second Day The Earth appear 15 times bigger and brighter to the Moon than she does to us. This may be observ'd just about new Moon and after; when her then dark Body is render'd plainly visible by the reflected Light of our Earth; yet this terrestrial Light, when the Earth appears at Full to the Lunar People, is not above a 3600th Part of the Sun's Light there.. A glaring Globe we seem, immense and vast: O'er the small World, in fixt Suspension The Moon who in respect of the Sun and Stars turns round herself, in respect of us does not turn at all; they seem to her to rise and set in the space of 15 Days; but our Earth appears to her to be held up in the same Place of the Heavens.

That still enjoys Earth's large reflected Light, This Darkness mantles in uncheering Night. So Jove's fair Moons, so those that Saturn grace, Turn to their Chiefs, like ours, one constant Face. Yet mark this Star, whose neighbouring Orb may seem Best known of all the Planetary Scheme, Alas! (vain Boast of Science here below!) Of what we obvious view but least we know. Her Variations so extremely wide, Mock our weak Rules, to no sure Measures ty'd; None can her strange Phenomena impart, Humbling to human Pride, the Foil of Art. Shall I relate how some, with wild Essay, To this new World, have sought a vent'rous Way, Upborn on airy Sails, presumptuous Aim! And justly gain'd of Lunatick the Name? Ah! Wretch, be warn'd, so rash a Strife forbear, Nor, boldly urg'd, the certain Ruin dare. Keep Icarus' unhappy Fate in view, The Tale fictitious, but the Moral true. Dash'd on the rocky Surge, the fatal Flood Strew'd with his borrow'd Plumes, and stain'd with Blood. But if no Caution, no Reproof can find A pow'rful Charm to awe thy hardy Mind, Think o'er thy Scheme, impracticably vain; Attracting Earth thy Passage would restrain: That Pow'r The centripetral or gravitating Force exceeds the centrifugal, almost 300 times, by which all Bodies are kept subsiding to the Surfaces of their respective Planets. which checks her centrifugal Force, Wou'd fast withhold thy strange, eccentric Course. Or cou'dst thou break her Law, and pass the Bound, What Guide shou'd lead thee thro' the void Profound? Cold, dark, and destitute of vital Air Thy Lungs to nourish, or thy Flight to bear! Eternal Ages fix'd thou must appear Of suff'ring Fools a Monument severe. O too aspiring Man! whose Thirst to know Involv'd our Sire and all his Race in Woe, If Love of Things unknown inflame thy Mind, On Earth a safer, easier Labour find. The South's vast undiscover'd Tracts explore, And brave the Winter of our polar Shore: Or wouldst thou such advent'rous Toil forbear, And on more useful Search employ thy Care, To know thyself, the nobler World within, And all that lies unnotic'd there, begin. To sail the Seas of Passion understand, And steer aright to Reason's flow'ry Land. What pois'nous Weeds spontaneous Growth obtain Discreetly prove, and what resists their Bane. To cultivate the wilder'd human Mind, With Seeds of ev'ry wise and virtuous Kind, Prepare; let Piety enrich the Place, And ev'ry moral, learn'd, and social Grace. Let the sweet Charms of sacred Science move To contemplate the shining Orbs above, Heav'n's ample Volume studious to peruse, And wond'ring Thought in pleas'd Conjecture lose. The differing Times, revolving Planets know, Will pleasing Lessons to the Mind bestow. Compare with Mercury Earth's annual Pace, To theirs how lengthen'd seems its hasty Race! Like us if subject to be born and die, If Fate Life's Course by our short Measure try, Alas, how soon they reach the destin'd Gole, Whose four full Years in our one Period roll! So the Ephemeron, on the wat'ry Plains, From Embryo Seeds its swift Perfection gains. The grown, pleas'd Insect skims the native Flood, Acts, rests, and propagates her future Brood; Yet few short Hours include her vital Date, One transient Eve both gives her Birth, and Fate. With ours, when match'd, how yet more long appears The spacious Measure of Saturnian Years! While two the Infant, there, can fully gain, Man's whole threescore completed Date obtain: When, to the Comets, Saturn's Year compare, In some, as vast exceeds the Difference there. Do various Beings all these Mansions fill? The restless Mind has fresh Enquiries still. What Forms, Proportions, Natures, Senses, Arts, Dispens'd to each, Creative Pow'r imparts? Seem they like ours, or differ each, in all? Fix how we can, on Mystery we fall! Whatever Race possess th' ethereal Plain, What Orbs they people, or what Ranks maintain, Tho' the deep Secret Heav'n conceal below, One Truth, of universal Scope, we know; Our nobler Part, the same celestial Mind, Relates Earth's Sons to all their Reas'ning Kind. One Deity, one sole creating Cause, Our active Cares, and joint Devotion draws. Whether (since doubtless from Man's Trespass freed) Their Pray'rs the Mediatorial Incense need, Lies closely veil'd. Heav'n's Oracles record All Worlds were form'd by this efficient Word: And whether the Eternal, pleas'd to own By full, illustrious Marks his darling Son; Or, his Perfections brighter to display, Deigns no Approach, but this appointed Way, Say, Race of social Creatures! who fulfil His high Command, and know th' Almighty Will. Thee Parent blest! thro' all thy Works ador'd, They praise, and hail Thee, universal Lord! Thee first, from everlasting, they proclaim, Just, wise, almighty, pure,—thy awful Name; Then all thy milder Glories they diffuse, The darling Titles thou delight'st to use, Thy Attributes of Mercy, Goodness, Grace, Mild Father, kind Preserver of their Race; A Name thy dear Affections well approve, Whose Nature, indefectible, is Love. Meet me, blest Thought, in my retired Hour, When my bent Knees confess this wond'rous Pow'r! When with rais'd Eyes I view those Worlds above, Engag'd in the same grateful Work of Love, Let the grand Scene my solemn Act prepare, And my Soul join a universal Pray'r! Astronomy, hail, Science heavenly-born! Thy Schemes the Life assist, the Mind adorn. To changing Seasons give determin'd Space, And fix to Hours and Years their measur'd Race. The pointing Dial, on whose figur'd Plane Of Time's still Flight we Notices obtain; The Pendulum, dividing lesser Parts, Their Rise acquire from thy inventive Arts. Th' acute Geographer, th' Historian sage, By thy Discov'ries clear the doubtful Page. From mark'd Eclipses Longitude perceive, Can settle Distances, and Æras give. From his known Shore the Seaman distant far Steers, safely guided, by thy Polar Star; Nor errs when Clouds and Storms obscure its Ray, His Compass marks him as exact a Way. When frequent Travels had th' instructive Chart Supply'd, the Prize of philosophic Art! Two curious mimic Globes, to crown the Plan, Were form'd; by his Creator's Image, Man. The first, with Heav'n's bright Constellations vast Rang'd on the Surface, with the Earth's Climes the last. Copy of this by Human Race possess'd: Which Lands indent, and spacious Seas invest. Fram'd on imaginary Poles to move, With Lines, and different Circles mark'd above. The pleasur'd Sense, by this Machine, can tell In what Positions various Nations dwell: Round the wide Orb's exteriour Surface spread; How Side-ways some the solid Convex tread: While a more sever'd Race of busy Pow'rs Project, with strange Reverse, their Feet to ours. So, in the limpid Pool, the Gazer sees Huge Mountains pendant, and inverted Trees. So on the Apples smooth, suspended Ball (If greater we may represent by small) The swarming Flies their reptile Tribes divide, And cling, Antipodal, on every Side. Hence pleasant Problems may the Mind discern Of ev'ry Soil their Length of Days to learn; Can tell when round, to each fix'd Place, shall come Faint Dawn, Meridian Light, or Midnight Gloom: These Gifts to Astronomic Art we owe, Its use extensive, yet its Growth but slow. If back we look on antient Sages Schemes, They seem ridiculous as Children's Dreams: How shall the Church, that boasts unerring Truth, Blush at the Raillery of each modern Youth; When told her Pope Urban VIII. who imprison'd Galileo in the Inquisition five Years., for asserting the Motion of the Earth round the Sun, and exacted his Recantation at the Age of 60, before he could obtain his Enlargement., of Heresy, arraign'd The Sage, who Earth's Rotation once maintain'd! Vain Epicurus, and his frantic Class, Misdeem'd our Globe a plane quadrangle Mass; A fine romantic Terras spread in State, On central Pillars that support its Weight; Like Indian Sophs See Bernier's Memoirs, Tom. III. p. 169., who this terrestrial Mold, Affirm four sturdy Elephants uphold. What Ideot Fables of the Sun they feign! “New ev'ry Morn, ascending from the Main, “A smooth, flat Disk, nor of a larger Size, “Than what it measures to the naked Eyes.” As pos'd the Stagyrite's dark School appears, Perplex'd with Tales devis'd of Crystal Spheres, Strange solid Orbs, and Circles oddly fram'd; Who with Philosophy their Reveries nam'd. How long did Ptolomy's dark Riddle spread, With Doubts deep-puzzling each Scholastic Head. Till, like the Theban wise, in Story fam'd, Copernicus that Sphynxian Monster sham'd; He the true Planetary System taught, Which the learn'd Samian Pythagoras learnt from the Egyptian Priests the true Theory of the Universe, and brought it into Greece, which Copernicus since restor'd and establish'd. first from Egypt brought, Long from the World conceal'd, in Error lost, Whose rich Recovery latest Times shall boast. Then Tycho rose, who, with incessant Pains, In their due Ranks replac'd the starry Trains. His Labours, by a fresh Industry mov'd, Hevelius, Flamsteed, Halley, since improv'd. Lo! the great Lyncian Artist Galileo was the first that toward the beginning of the last Century, applied the Telescope (the admired Invention of Metius of Amsterdam) to celestial Observations. now aspires Thro' the rais'd Tube to mark the Stellar Fires! The Galaxy with clust'ring Lights o'erspread, The new-nam'd Stars in bright Orion's Head, The varying Phases circling Planets show, The Solar Spots, his Fame was first to know, Of Jove's Attendants, Orbs till then unknown, Himself the big Discovery claims alone. Cassini next and Huygens, like renown'd, The Moons and wond'rous Ring of Saturn found. Sagacious Kepler, still advancing, saw Th' elliptic Motion, Nature's plainest Law, That universal acts thro' every Part: This laid the Basis of Newtonian Art. Newton! vast Mind! whose piercing Pow'rs apply'd The secret Cause of Motion first descry'd; Found Gravitation was the primal Spring, That wheel'd the Planets round their central King; Mysterious Impulse! that more clear to know Exceeds the finite Reach of Art below. Forbear bold Mortal! 'tis an impious Aim, Own God immediate acting thro' the Frame. 'Tis He, unsearchable, in all resides; He, the First Cause their Operations guides. Fear on his awful Privacy to press, But, honouring Him, thy Ignorance confess. The End of the Third Book. BOOK IV. Observations on the Sun and Fixed Stars. The Argument. The former Books having been employed in a Survey of the Earth and Planets, This last proceeds to consider the Sun, the Head and Principal of our System, and from thence, by Occasion, passes on to a View of the Fixed Stars, believed in their Nature and Uses to resemble our Solar Orb; where a few Enquiries are proposed concerning the Times of their Creation and Dissolution, with some Reflections on Comets, and the sudden Appearing and Disappearing of several new Stars. Whence the Absurdity of the Peripatetic Philosophy is inferr'd. And the Epicurean appeal'd to, for the Existence of a God and Providence. The whole concluding with a Hymn of Praise to the tremendous and adorable Deity. From Earth, our glorious, tho' inferiour, Seat; From Planets, that their changeless Course repeat; More boldly ventrous I my Search pursue: And Suns above, in vast Expansion view. O Molesworth! Deathless in thy Patriot-Fame; Dear to thy Britain by her Cato's Name! To Me, by grateful Memory, dearer still! First, generous Prompter of my tuneful Skill. Who my young Genius by thy Favours rais'd: Long to be mourn'd! as ever to be prais'd! This Wreath, my Love thy living Worth design'd, Sad, round thy Urn, the pious Muse shall bind. Behold the Sun! how near, to Sense, he seems! Small, neighb'ring Globe, array'd in lucid Beams: That West appears, deceptive of our Eyes, At Eve to set; that East appears to rise; Behold! (amaz'd, when serious we enquire) Immense his Size we find, an Orb of Fire, So large, ten Million Earths The Sun's Diameter, or Breadth from side to side, is about eight hundred thousand Miles; therefore the Quantity of Matter in him must exceed that of the Earth above ten million times. like ours below Wou'd but suffice his equal'd Mass to show. So distant, eighty Million Miles wou'd fail, Vast Sum! to count a full proportion'd Tale. Plac'd in the midst he keeps his central Throne, In State revolving on himself alone; Twelve Days here doubly clos'd The compleat Revolution of the Sun, upon his own Axis, his Spots discover to be in about 25 Days. his Motion spends Ere the huge Sphere one Circulation ends. While thro' his System, from his Regal Seat, His Rays dispense prolific Light and Heat; Their Homage Planetary Subjects pay, And round him, distanc'd, take their order'd Way. What is this Globe, Compact? of Earthlike Mold? Or liquid all? an Orb of melted Gold? Whose Action, Density, and Bulk, conspire Perpetual to preserve his wond'rous Fire; Cloath'd with an Atmosphere, whose Weight's Excess May forcibly th' exhaling Parts compress, As Magnets back their Steams retracted call; Or Floods disgorg'd, in their own Whirlpools fall. Else his exhausted Stores, with dread Decay Wou'd, by long Time, burn out, and fume away. Six thousand Years, to Life, prodigious Space! His Beams, incessant, have refresh'd our Race, On all th' ethereal Wand'rers shed their Light, Yet still his Pow'rs unwasted seem to Sight. If meer Antiquities of ev'ry kind Impress a pleasing Rev'rence on the Mind, The useless Coin obscur'd with eating Rust, The shatter'd Ruin, or the mould'ring Bust, More venerable far our Thoughts should deem This eldest, signal Work, of Pow'r supreme. Behold this Brightness still! wou'd Sense suppose Dim Spots shou'd e'er its lucid Face enclose? Yet such, detected by th' assisting Glass, Oft o'er its Surface in Succession pass: Some, spacious as our Europe's ample Plains, Vast as our World, th' observing Eye attains. Now form'd, augmenting while their Tour they make Now lost, as floating o'er th' enkindled Lake; Borne on his Ball they keep mysterious Round, A while obscure him, and then scarce are found. Whole Days Theophanes the Historian relates it was once so dark, in the Time of Irene the Empress, for 17 Days together, that Ships lost their Way, and were in Danger of splitting against each other. their Mists have veil'd his Light from View, Whole Years The Year following Julius Cæsar's Death, Pliny affirms there were “prodigiosi &amp; longiores Solis defectus, totius anni pallore continuo.” Hist. Nat. L. 2. It appear'd again a whole Year so in Justinian's Time, Cedrenes writes, with a very dim and duskish Hue, as if he had been in perpetual Eclipse. The Solar Maculæ were not then discover'd, but it is not questioned but they were the Occasion. it wore a faint and palid Hue. Shall they at last, in desolating Shade, Th' incrusted Star with dire Eclipse invade? And as the Seers inspir'd, prophetic, write Joel ii. 2. compared with iii. 15., ‘Blot his fair Lustre with eternal Night?’ Prelude of fatal Doom; when in return Earth, scorch'd with purifying Flames, shall burn; Perhaps consum'd, but (Phœnix like) to rise, Fair as a Sun, in renovated Skies. Pass we th' o'er-curious Theme, nor vent'rous, scan Heav'n's hid Decree, inscrutable to Man. Lo! to new Wonders now thy Search remove. See'st thou those Orbs that numerous roll above? Those Lamps, that nightly greet thy visual Pow'rs, Are each a bright capacious Sun like ours. How vivid they emit their lucid Streams! Not like the Planets dull, reflected Beams; Of their own Essence, like the Solar Ray, Thro' boundless Spaces they their Flames convey. In the fam'd Bear, whose Lights our Pole surround, Observe, two close-appearing Stars are found. Both small, tho' diff'ring; both so near reside, A Hand might seem the shining Points to hide. Ah! treach'rous Sense!—each far from each remains, Far, as from either lie Earth's sever'd Plains. Tho' in our annual Path It is one very considerable Argument for the immense Distance of the fixed Stars, that those two in the Tail of the Great Bear afford no Parallax, nor admit of any Encrease, whatever Point of our Orbit we view them from; which is very strange, for in moving round the Sun we must have approached toward them by the whole Diameter of the Magnus Orbis, which consequently is double our Distance from hence to the Sun, and an advance in the Heavens, of one hundred and sixty Millions of Miles, by the lowest Computation. we upward run, Rais'd in the Heav'ns twice higher than the Sun, Almost two hundred Million Times more nigh, No seeming Difference can we there espy. Thro! our whole Circle in the changing Year, From all Positions they the same appear: No Benefit of Height, no Help of Art, Can to their Figures least Increase impart; Tho' of these Optic Instruments they tell Some, ev'n to Hundred Times, their Objects swell. Mark! Sirius mounted in th' unclouded Sky, How strong he glitters on the pleasur'd Eye, In Lustre matchless, on the azure Plain, Nearest to Earth Sirius, or the Dog-Star, is supposed the nearest to us of any of the fixed Stars. Mr. Huygens imagining him much about the Bigness and Brightness of our Sun, thought upon an Experiment to measure his Distance (given in his Cosmetheo. &amp;c.) by so lessening the Sun's Diameter as to make him appear thro' the Tube not larger than the Dog-Star. He found the Difference was as twenty seven Thousand six Hundred sixty four to one, or that Sirius is so many of the Sun's Distances from us, which (taking Dr. Harris's lesser Computation) is Twenty seven Thousand six hundred sixty four times 80 Million of Miles; tho' Mr. Derham, Dr. Halley, &amp;c. think the Sun's Distance to be almost 40 Million of Miles more, which makes the Amount, nearly, half as much again. of all the station'd Train: Nearest, perplexing Thought! yet distant more Than Rule can measure, or than Mind can soar. Stretch to the Sun thy long prodigious Flight, Thence, twice ten thousand times, exceed his Height, But little, little Gain thy Toil wou'd cheer, Scarce there, his Orb wou'd magnify'd appear; Six hundred thousand Million Miles proceed, Short of thy End th' extended Path would lead Mr. Huygens has observ'd, the Distance from us to Sirius is twenty seven Thousand six Hundred sixty four times the Sun's Distance from us. After 20 thousand of those could be passed, there is 7664 Distances remaining, which multiply'd by 80 Millions, the least supposed Distance of the Sun, amounts to more than the Numbers I have mentioned. It may be thought incredible so large an Accession of Miles should not alter the Appearance of these Bodies, yet it is Dr. Harris's Observation, “That could we advance 99 Parts in 100 of the whole Distance, and there was but the one hundredth Part left, they would appear very little larger than they do now.” Astron. Dial. p. 82.. Yet this, the only measur'd Star we know, Compar'd, will seem diminutively low: Farther from this, than this from Earth is plac'd, Th' ethereal Regions with new Orbs are grac'd; Farther than those from this, fresh Numbers still The Depths of lost Infinity may fill. Since from our Centre so remote they lie, Can our far Sun their Flux of Light supply? Were it to reach th' immensurable Way, Cou'd we receive the weak, reflected Ray? What can they be? (thus self-illustrious shown) What, less than Suns? “Questionless those sparkling Fires have a nobler Use than barely to spangle our Hemisphere; a Benefit every passing Cloud can deprive us of—How much more rational is it to consider them as the several Suns of different Systems of Planets!” Phil. to Hydasp. 2d Con. p. 21. resembling each our own. Our own resembling! Why did Heav'n produce This Orb, but for his Planets mutual Use? Have theirs, to cherish with their vital Fires, No happy Train, no circulating Quires? Shine they all void thro' solitary Space? Fair to no Service? fruitful with no Race? No Reptile, Plant, nor Animal, to tend? Vast, without Worth? and active, for no End? O! rather think, since form'd with equal Pow'rs, Heav'n meant their Systems as compleat as ours. O'erwhelming Image! what a boundless Scene Breaks on the Mind! what Musings intervene! What! when Discov'ries still their Sum enlarge, Swell on, and Mental Faculties o'ercharge. With the Perspective; lo! th' Observer sees More num'rous Orbs, and more, succeed to these. In the bright Knot, where six small Pleiads shine, Full seventy clust'ring Luminaries join; Where fam'd Orion's Constellation glows, Two thousand mingling Stars their Orbs disclose. How thick, discernible to aided Sight, Their Central Forms possess the Milky Height! Whose Spheres elude the Reach of naked Eyes, And seem with Light to belt the whiten'd Skies. Have each (a Sov'reign in his System's Bound) Their lighted Earths, and Moons, revolving round, Inhabitable all? their Plants and Flow'rs? Their Insects, Animals, and Reasoning Pow'rs? Confute it, Mortal! whose elating Pride Wou'd to thyself the Universe divide. What, tho' no Planets round those Orbs of Light Appear, thus distant, to thy failing Sight, Seen from their Region would thy Wand'rers run To a like Point, all shrunk within thy Sun. Thy Sun wou'd seem, by a Remove so far, Diminutive as theirs, suppos'd a Star. View'd with his kindred Lamps, their Night to cheer, In the same Surface of one concave Sphere. Say, do Reflections, Man! enlarg'd like these, Thy vain Ambition's ruling Lust displease; Yet, humble Christian, thy unswelling Mind May from their Lessons deep Instruction find. Jesus the God! th' existing Worlds proclaim, To Thee related by a dearer Name; Jesus the Man! th' incarnate, saving Friend, To thy admiring Thoughts they more commend; He, who thy Nature bore, thy Sins atton'd, Is Lord of all this vast Creation own'd; If lessen'd by the View thyself thou see, The more his Love it magnifies for Thee. My Jesus! thou, dear Mediatorial Lord! Can'st to Heaven's Sov'reign nigh access afford; Can'st introduce me to his bright Abode, And raise a Worm, to view his wond'rous God. Eas'd of my Guilt, his Terrors disappear; No more his Justice wakes my trembling Fear: His Holiness, his Truth, my dread before, All leagu'd with Mercy, now dismay no more. By Thee redeem'd, thy Mite, thy breathing Dust, Sees him appeas'd, yet holy; good, yet just. Sees o'er the Angelic Nature Man's preside, With Godhead's self in near Relation ty'd: Sons new adopted, ransom'd to supply Thrones of fall'n Seraphs, in th' eternal Sky. O! may their Wand'rings ne'er my Heart misguide, Keep me, blest Saviour! from their Wiles and Pride; If with pure Souls thy Love has number'd mine, Thine be the Praise, as all the Merit Thine. Here Reason, fain, inquisitive would pry, And ask when rose these Glories of the Sky: Form'd when our World at first Existence gain'd? And to one final Period all ordain'd? Or, since wide Space they independent fill, Apart created? or creating “Who shall presume to set Bounds to the Production of infinite Power, actuated by infinite Benevolence? Who shall circumscribe the Theatre upon which an omnipotent Goodness may think proper to display itself.” Phil. to Hyd. still? Do Scriptures clear, the aw'd Assent oppose? They chiefly our Original disclose. Do they assert, ere we in Being came, God ne'er was own'd by the Creator's Name? Where then were Angels The Formation of Angels prior to Man, is an Opinion the Generality of Divines have allow'd: As the more judicious have thought the Creation recorded by Moses, was confined in its View to that of our visible and Solar System., elder Race to Man? Who fell seduc'd, perhaps, ere He began: Do they assert prolific Pow'r, at rest, Shall in no future Instance shine confest? How then shall, long foretold, (declare ye Wise) New Worlds, new Heav'ns in distant Ages rise? What if the sacred Page shou'd only mean To paint the forming one creative Scene, These Heav'ns that visibly our World embrace, This Sun with all his Planetary Race? Fair System! whose completed Work we own. Perhaps, too, Suff'rers in one Doom alone. Must all those sep'rate Worlds with ours below, Fix'd by one Law, a general Period know? Forgive, if briefly I impart a Thought: What, to the Muse, conject'ral, has been taught. Some think more Planets, than have reach'd our Sight, Lie hid 'twixt Mercury, and the Solar Light The regular Returns of the same Spots in the Sun have been, by some, thought favourable to this Hypothesis, (whose Author is the learned Mr. Wall) none knowing what those Spots are. After several Years that they have been lost, we begin to see them again; generally at the Hour and Place of the Sun, where they ought to appear. M. de la Hire. Hist. del'Acad. des Scien. 1700.; More still, betwixt the Orb of Saturn cast, And the Fix'd-Stars, may fill that mighty Vast, Which God, on his creating Work employ'd, Perhaps, wou'd scarcely leave one total Void. Six Thousand have been guess'd their Sums, and more, That might be rang'd this wide Expansion o'er Suppose (to take the least Measure for the vast Space betwixt Saturn and the fixed Stars) it be a thousand Times as far as from the Sun to Saturn; there being six Planets in the latter, proportionably, six Thousand may be in the Former.; These He may destine, in their several Turn, The Sun's o'er-close Proximity shall burn, Whirld (in eccentrical Descension lost) It's Sphere too nigh; or in its Furnace tost. And each new Comet, that our Sight acquires, Of such doom'd Worlds may be the Funeral Fires A Comet is a solid Body about the Earth's bigness (more or less) all on Fire. They have always their Line of Motion falling towards the Sun.. Nor Wonder, while amid so large a Throng, Earth and her five near Sisters 'scape so long. Had, each ten Years This Calculation is founded upon the Observation, that about seven Comets have been seen thus falling within the last seventy Years of our Time. since first our World begun, The fatal Conflagration seiz'd on One. More than five Thousand of the numerous Train, Safe in their separate Bounds wou'd yet remain; One Neighbour should those tragick Flames infest, Presageful Dread might well alarm the Rest. Thus Reason aims beyond her Length to see: Still, stranger to Heav'n's mystical Decree. Yet will she ask why in sublimest Skies, Suns, there, themselves expire, and New arise? In that Lacteal Path that shines above, Frequent those direful Revolutions prove. Where the bright Ship is seen with Lights embost, Two signal Stars “These were in the Stern and Yard of the Ship Argo, observed in 1664, but in 1668 there was not the least Glimpse of them to be seen; when they disappeared first is not known: The rest about them, even of the 3d and 4th Magnitudes, remain'd the same. I have observ'd many more Changes, to the Number of 100, among the Fixed Stars, yet none so great at these, &amp;c.” Mr. Montanere's Letter to the Roy. Soc. have long their Stations lost. The well-known Orbs no Search could yet regain; Void lie their Regions on th' ethereal Plain. Once seven Quæ septem dici, sex tamen esse solent. Ovid. were number'd in the Pleiade Throng, Where since, for Ages, only Six belong. 'Tis thought, their Spots might fatal Growth acquire, Dim the clos'd Orbs, and quench their native Fire. Near fair Andromeda's The new Star in Cassiopeia was first observed about the middle of November 1572, its Lustre was so great it could be seen in fair Sun-shine. It never changed its Place all the Time, but by Degrees diminished, and in about 18 Months became invisible. illustrious Sign, The Modern Tycho Brahe. first discern'd a Globe to shine; Unview'd, till beaming on his wond'ring Sight, As Sirius large, as nearest Venus bright. Yet, strange to tell, ere two short Years were past, The vanish'd Star a total Shade o'ercast. While lo! appearing in the Swan That other new Star in the Swan's Breast, was discovered by Kepler in the Year 1600; afterwards for some time it disappear'd, but was discern'd again by Hevelius in 1666, just in its first Place, as a Star of the Sixth Magnitude, where it still appears. to rise, A fresh Discov'ry claims our noting Eyes, An Orb, far less, but Stationary found; Like the bright Centres which our View surround. Since, have an hundred Years their Circles roll'd, Yet clear its fixt Illuminations hold. Whence are these Changes in the mighty Void? Are Worlds created there, and Worlds destroy'd? Some, lucid Suns just kindling into Light? Some, whelm'd, and closing in a fatal Night? Some, half obscur'd, eluding all Survey, Then glimmering with a temporary Ray? State, dismal sure! to all the Systems near, If Planets, Life, and Creatures plac'd to cheer. Are these unfathom'd Myst'ries, that we trace, True Solar Lustres It is difficult to determine what these new Stars are. The sudden Appearing of some; the total Disappearing of others; and the Half-occultation of a third Sort, sometimes turning their dark, then their light Sides toward us, has occasioned various Conjectures of learned Men, express'd in the Poem. None of which solve all the Phenomena, the same having been discovered of some of the known six'd Stars themselves: A Wonder, which, perhaps, Man's Art will never fathom., fix'd thro' vary'd Space? Whose Fires, in-pent, thick Spots have dark entomb'd, Freed by some Comets Blaze, and re-illum'd? Or Planets, seen when nearest our Abode, The Suns, wide circling of the Milky-Road? Saturnian like, each System's outmost Part; Or Comets that excentrical convert? Omnific God! thy Beam refulgent vail! To trace thy Works all Man's Ideas fail. Blush, antient Master Aristotle. of the Sages Chair! Confuted, now, thy Ignorance declare; Who bold, yet blind, who teaching, to be taught, Of changeless Make the Heavenly Matter thought, Its Orbs firm Diamond, of dural Stay: All unsusceptible of least Decay. And You, worse Patrons of absurd Misrule, Ye vainly learn'd in Epicurus' School, Who heavenly Pow'r, and Providence disgrace, To clear Conviction yield, ye erring Race! Search the least Path creative Pow'r has trod, How plain the Footsteps of th' apparent God!

God's smallest Work all human Skill degrades, Foils the lost Man, and sinks his Worth in Shades. If lesser Proofs such Demonstration show, What may th' unmeasur'd Universe bestow? Think, cou'd blind Chance, dead, unexisting Name, Produce such Order, so complete a Frame? That Sun, bright Fountain of Life-gladd'ning Day, Who kindled first his cheering vital Ray? (Fix'd, that not too remote, nor near he shines) And stores with Fuel his eternal Mines? What Hand th' unnumber'd Solar Worlds sustains, And guides their circling Planetary Trains; That from their Orbits ne'er excentric wheel The whirling Spheres, and dire Confusion feel? Is there no Wisdom in th' Appointment shown? Own they no Former, no Preserver own? Cou'd Nature's constant, wise, harmonious Laws, Spring from weak Chance? so impotent a Cause! Did it bestow on Man his Reasoning Mind? Or needful Instincts on th' inferiour Kind? Or the mixt Species of their various Race Maintains, in due Succession, Number, Place? Can it their diff'rent Wants discern, relieve? Whence has it Pow'r? and how does it perceive? Reflect, vain Dreamers, ye pretended Wife! You who confide on darken'd Carus' Eyes, Close his dim Leaves, and ponder Nature's Page, There let clear Truth your pleas'd Assent engage, And the dread God confess; his Sapience own, Thro' the fill'd Space with brightest Lustre shown. 'Tis He, 'twas his efficient Word profound, Form'd, conservates and rules the Worlds around; How grand a Scheme, cou'd we our Search pursue, And thro' its various Ranks Creation view! The Depths 'twixt Seraphim and Angel scan, And trace, by slow Gradations, down to Man; From Man, thro' Orders numberless, descend, 'Till the last Link the Chain of Beings end; Lost in the Point where Entity begun.— Or, backward, cou'd the Mind revolving run; Quite up again, and with admiring Eyes, See the huge Scale to new Perfection rise.

O how sublime a Wisdom must intend, So vast a Plan! to ev'ry Part descend, And know their various Int'rests to pursue, At one clear, unperplex'd, immediate View! Admir'd Omniscience, that at once can see Past, present, and whate'er shall future be! How great a Pow'r must all their Wants supply! Its Cares how watchful, and its Aids how nigh! Each Spring to move, each Hind'rance to controul, And act, by Parts, subservient to the Whole! Hail, infinite Creator; with thy Praise The Muse began, with Thee shall end my Lays. These are thy Works, blest Architect divine! Earth, all this universal Offspring thine! Thy Breath first bid inactive Matter move, And strait wirh Life the genial Atoms strove; Producing Animal, and Plant, and Flow'r, Concurrent Proof of Wisdom and of Pow'r. Thy potent Word infus'd the Solar Light, And spread the Curtain of refreshing Night, With splendid Orbs enrich'd the Void profound, Rang'd the bright Worlds, and roll'd their Courses round. O sing his Praises then! how justly due, Created Kinds, the Strains of Praise from You? How grateful the deserv'd Returns of Love! Praise Him, thou Earth, ye Worlds that roll above, Each Pow'r, whole Nature, all His Works, conspire In Songs of Praise; an Universal Quire! Thou Sun, Creation's pure resplendent Eye, And all ye Solar Orbs that deck the Sky, Round whose vast Systems peopled Planets move, Ye central Suns of numerous Earths above; Praise the dread Pow'r, whose Goodness ye proclaim, And let your warbling Spheres attune His Name! Thou Moon, whose Rays diffus'd of silver Light, Brighten the shapeless Gloom of awful Night; And you Satellitary Orbs on high, Who kindly Beams to distant Worlds supply, Hymn your Creator's Praise; whose Skill divine Impow'r'd your Mass to roll, your Globes to shine. Ye Comets! that in long Ellipses stray, Whole Ages finishing your annual Way; Thou Darkness! Nature's emblematic Tomb, Yield him thy Reverence of impressive Gloom, In silent Praise! And thou, dread Space profound, Thro' all thy waste, interminable Round. Winds! who in troubled Air your Voices raise, Swell with loud Accents in your Maker's Praise, And you, soft Breezes, that perfume the Spring, Bear Him a Tribute on your gentler Wing. Spread it, ye pealing Thunders, round the Sky, Wide as your Vollies roll, or Lightnings fly! Ye Meteors! your Creator's Praises show; The spangled Dew, the Clouds reflected Bow, And moist'ning Show'r. Ye Frosts! his Praise proclaim; The pendant Isicle's clear, native Gem; Hoar Mists congeal'd, that dress the Meadow pale: Blue Vapour, whitening Snows, and pearly Hail! Praise Him, ye Seasons! Spring with youthful Face, And Summer blooming with maturer Grace; Ripe Autumn, clad in Wines, with Harvests crown'd, And Winter old; His solemn Praise resound! Ye Flow'ry Tribes, in all your proud Array, Your lovely Forms, and dazzling Hues display! Young fruitful Branches! white with vernal Bloom, In rich Oblations breathe your fresh Perfume! Praise Him, ye Plants! with all your sweet Supplies; Ye od'rous Herbs, in grateful Incense rise! Insects! that creep on Earth, or spread the Wing, In Troops your tributary Homage bring. Fowls of the Air! and Brutes that range the Meads! And the finn'd Race that Stream and Ocean breeds. Cherubic Dignities, in Heav'n, who shine, Own'd Symbols of the Trinity Ezekiel i. 28. x. 18, 19, 20. Fire, Light, and Air (or Spirit) seem to have been the proper, known, and scriptural Emblems of the Trinity in the one Essence. Their familiar Hieroglyphicks were the Ox; whose curled Forehead aptly represented the Fire, the Emblem of the First Person. The Lion, from his brightness of Sight, was used for the Hieroglyphick of the Second. And the Eagle, the highest soaring Bird, of the Third. Accordingly the Cherubic-Faces, exhibited in the above-cited prophetical Vision, bore these several Figures. The fourth Face, of a Man joined to that of the Lion (the Hieroglyphick for Light, the Emblem of the Second Person in the Trinity) had a beautiful and teaching Signification, of the Assumption of the Human into the Divine Nature by our Lord Jesus Christ; and might convey this comfortable Doctrine to our first Parents, when thus beheld (in the Appearance of the Cherubim placed over the Gates of Paradise) at their Expulsion. See also Rev. iv. 6, 7. divine! Ye Seraphim, bright Flames! ye Angel Quires! To the lov'd Theme tune all your sounding Lyres! Saints! thron'd in Bliss, Sin-vassal'd once below, In noblest Strains your loftier Praise bestow! Man! Image of thy Maker's moral Pow'r, Last, labour'd Work of Heav'n's creating Hour! O shall his Goodness, his Indulgence, move No warm Returns, nor swell the Breath of Love? Priest of the mute Creation, He demands Their Off'rings from thy consecrated Hands, Deputed Lord; from thy dead Slumber start; Let Nature wake, awake the Pow'rs of Art, And with exerted Force attune his Praise, In Notes may emulate celestial Lays. Let Music her divinest Succours bring, The breathing Flute, the Viol's warbling String, And dulcid Voice. Ye Concerts, louder grow! Let the shrill Trump, the deep'ning Organ blow, While with the Notes the tremulating Ground, And echoing Roofs, strike awful Rapture round. Praise him, each Creature, Plenitude, and Space; Things of Inanimate and living Race! From the Terrestrial to the Starry Pole, Praise him his Works, and thou, my prostrate Soul! Thus, while in vain the wretched human Brood Pursue on Earth a false, imagin'd Good; That Good, which Creatures never can bestow, With him still only found, from whom they flow; While Gold or Lust, with a deceitful Bribe, Tempt to sure Woes the easy-list'ning Tribe; While Faction leads th' unsteady Herd aside, And Deism perverts the Sons of Pride; Wou'd I from Vice, from Luxury remove, Conversing with the Themes of heavenly Love. These shall my Hours of virtuous Life amuse, Cheer its dull Glooms, and brighter Hopes infuse: Pleas'd the lov'd Visit frequent to renew, While certain Bliss my rais'd Desires pursue, To meditate my Maker; and my Lays Tune to his Pow'r, who gave me Breath to praise.

John ii. 17. ? the consecrated Hour Of Man, in Audience with the Deity. Young. SUNDAY THOUGHTS. THE Morning's Meditating Walk. PART I. On the Internal, Early, and Preparatory Duties. CONTENTS. An Introduction to the Subject. The Advantage of separating some time the Evening before a Sabbath. Address to the Dutchess of Somerset. The Appearance of the Dawn. Reflections upon rising; at walking Abroad; on the Pleasantness of the Season—on a Life of rural Retirement; a Morning Hymn on ascending a Hill, in a View of the surrounding Prospects; Reflections during a solitary Wandring in a Church-yard—observing a Rookery—sitting by a River; a Visit to a lonely Abbey, and taking shelter in its Ruins during the Violence of a Thunder-storm. Its Horrors describ'd; with some closing Reflections on our late Earthquakes—The sweet Appearances in Nature on the Calm.—Lawfulness of walking in the Fields for Meditation in the Intervals of a Lord's Day; one Part of Sabbath Duties a Remembrance of the Works of Creation; the other those of Redemption. Various Considerations and Instances of the Blessings and Privileges of the latter—upon first hearing the Bells from the different Villages—the Walk broke off; and an Application to a timely Attendance on religious Ordinances in the House of God. Mute with conceal'd Distress, joy-widow'd long, My own sad Burthen, had my tuneless Mind Disconsolate, life wearied, dropt the Lyre; Like the sad, pensive, wint'ry Philomel Silenc'd from Song: By Melancholy's Gloom, By Griefs, unyielding to the Muse's Charm. Nor purpos'd more, nor wish'd I, e'er to wake The once relieving String. So lost with me Care's Cheerer, Hope, ah! that Deceiver fair! My Spirits broke, by worst Presage imprest, A Mind benighted, with a wasting Frame. Jesus! dear Name of Love! O Saviour God! After long Absence, how divinely Sweet Thy felt Return! like instantaneous Health, Delightful, to a Wretch by Sickness worn, Snatch'd back miraculous from dying Pangs. He comes! Pain's Balm, the healing Visitor, The sympathising Friend! Rise, languid Soul! From thy dark, deep, dull, damp, dead Lethargy. With kindled Zeal resume, with fresh-felt Love, Thy wonted Labour; not (perhaps) my least, If heavenly Goodness please the Strain divine, To dictate, and assist her kindred Theme. Six days has Man in duteous Toil employ'd: His Sum assign'd. And now the Eve appears, Prelude to sweetest Hours of holier Rest; Kind Respite, in the round of Weekly Time, For travell'd Dust to call its Labourer home The Partner Mind; to steal her from the Throng Of loud Intruders, charg'd with worldly Schemes; And strike a partial Truce with mortal Care. To cleanse her Soils, adjust her decent Dress, And mould her, in Composure fit, to wait Her Call; when she, on Audience, soon shall meet In his full Court, the universal King. The Chamber, for the milder Presence, fix'd Of condescending Deity. So went Th' obedient Sire Abraham. Genesis xxii. 5. his dear, devoted Son Consorting, up th' appointed Mount of God, And, inly tended, with Exclusion mete, At distance, left below his servile Train. I sing to matchless Somerset: where'er The Changes lead me of this sacred Theme (Truths Evangelical tho' plainly phras'd) Her's is the Song. Her shining Pattern view; Mark it ye Great! from her aspire to gain By Goodness Love, true Dignity from Sense, And Exaltation by Humility: Blest Gifts, the Crown of Piety and Faith. Her's is the Song; auspicious prove it's Art! As She, mild Excellence! auspicious proves. See! Night has thinn'd her Shades. The watchful Bird Days warning Centinel, with Crowings loud Gives Signal. O! like weeping Peter touch'd! Duly let me, affecting Monitor! Thy Summons hear. Thus woke th' illustrious Greek Philip of Macedon. Rous'd, ev'ry Morn, by a shrill Herald's Cry, “King! thou art mortal.” Moral Voice, how harsh In Courtly Roofs!—But mark! the meek-ey'd Dawn! Lights youngest Daughter, drest in Vesture pale, With sweet, cool Breath, descends from odorous Skies! The Sabbath Dawn, first of the Week, and best, “Up Sleeper! from thy Bed. At earlier Hour “From sadder Bed, for Thee thy Saviour rose!” By Memory warn'd, at the lov'd Name I wake. At the known, reverenc'd Voice devoutly wake; I wake with God: last in my Thoughts and first By Night and Morn. My Guardian of the Night, My Guide by Day. Ah! what is lightless Day Without thy Light? Ah! what is lifeless Life Without thy dear Vitality? As Flow'rs, Weeping in wat'ry Dews, their Faces bend To their all-cheering Parent's genial Ray The fost'ring Sun, so turns my Soul to feel Her quick'ning Father. In thy Arms of Love Safe have I slept; thy Arms of Love alone Can safe-uphold me waking. Led by thee My Footsteps now I trust in open Skies; In sacred Meditation rapt; to taste The fresh, prime Fragrance of returning Light: While thy soft Daughter, Summer's Virgin-Nymph, The bloomy May, deck'd amorous by thy Hand, Courts, sweet, the lonely-roving Walker's Eye; Chaste-wooing ev'ry Sense, by ev'ry Charm. Retirement! thou celestial Solacer! The Care-tost Voyager's dear, welcome Bay, Faint with the beating Storm of adverse Life. Lot, most desir'd! most happy!—O with me Muse, Genius, Fame, Ambition, Av'rice, Wealth, My little, amplest whole of earthly Good! For thee I long have sigh'd—but sigh in vain! Sole woo'd, yet unconsenting to my Joy. Yet cease I not by Dawn, or Evening-Hour Thy lov'd Recess (tho' hopeless) still to haunt, And vent my secret Moan; by dewy Mead, Dark Cave, or vocal Stream, or Moon-light Grove. Like some poor exil'd Lover, who by Stealth Watches, when he his solitary Walk Can take; in desperation to complain. All that below (of calm, of good and pure, Of bland, or rational, devout, or sweet,) Is found in Wisdom's School, to train, mature, And lift sublime the Heart, inhabit here. Here shines the Hero, here true Greatness lives, Lives on its own, nor needs to ask Without Hard penury) Loans, from mean, dependant Joys. Leagued with the high-born Genii there, meek Peace, Fair Child of Virtue, and her Sister-Grace Divine Contentment; with her Little blest: The Dower bestow'd on patient Poverty. Happiest Abstraction from the tempting World! Not monkish, slothful, sullen, and austere; The Palmer's Penance, and the Hermit's Cell, The false-religious Bedlam's Beads and Straw. No Couch for Indolence to hatch her Dream: But to repose for Action; to purge off Rank Envy's Gall, the lep'rous Spot of Pride, Dropsied Ambition, Pleasure's feav'rish Heats, The Soul's consumptive Thirst of earthly Bliss, And her ill Habits by Example fix'd. Where led in awful Visits to herself, Internal Intimacies charm the Heart. The Home-brought Stranger entertain'd and pleas'd Feasts with her kindred Pow'rs, and happier grows, Acquainted with the Family within. And from her Centre thro' wide Duty's sphere (Of sacred and of social) looking round, Notes her high Birth; and nobler walks Abroad, In Acts of Faith, Benevolence, and Love, With Rank superior, in the moral World. Hail silent Fields! with your Inhabitant Blest Contemplation! friendly to the Muse. Yet grateful Interruption may ye here By Change admit; of Flocks that bleating feed, And Herds deep lowing, and the Musick shrill, Heard round me, of the Insect's buzzing Wing, And, loud, of early Birds the vary'd Charm. These praise their Maker all, and lift in praise The pious Heart, to join in Nature's Prayer. Nor Things of Voice alone, each humid Flow'r It's Incense breathes to Thee! each dewy Plant And grassy Spire, thick-strung with native Pearl! Almighty Father! Flocks, and Herds, and Birds Insects and Flowers, and Plants, all Nature's Births, All praise thy Goodness, all—but thankless Man! Man, most ungrateful! most obliged! of all. But see! in mild, resplendent Majesty, See! where ascending, the bright Lord of Day (His Forehead hung with Locks of curling Gold) Smiles from his eastern Throne; dispelling fast Th' invading Mists, that with distemper'd Shade Hang on Night's dusky Rear, and hide from view Surrounding Prospects fair: of Flowret Meads And Wood-clad Hills, with Villa's intermix'd Of antient Aspect; fram'd for rural Peace, Delightful Residence! and verdant Groves Of Structure tall, and silver-skirting Streams, Winding thro' Vales in Flora's Wardrobes drest, Or rich in stately Grain; whose loaded Plumes Dance proudly on the Breeze; and like a Sea Roll, far, the sounding vegetable Wave. And, all beyond, the Mountain-Heights appear, By distance blue; that lose themselves in Sky. How chang'd a Prospect! from the Scene of late, When Darkness, Emblem of still Nature's Grave, Had clos'd her in a temporary Death; Annihilating Colours, Sense, and Forms. On ev'ry Lid had shed her Poppy Dews, And round Creation's silent Bed had drawn Her sable Curtains, of Nocturnal Gloom. Thus looks the Convert (late in Bondage lock'd Of legal Terrors: a tremendous Night,) Thus chang'd! when on his sad, tenebrious Soul Jesus, the Day-Star, from above, shall rise With healing Balm beneath his radiant Wings; Jesus, of Righteousness, that brighter Sun! Is Light so grateful to the human Sense? Created Light? a faint, refracted Ray? One, distant Sun? the Shadow, but, of God! Dark Adumbration of the Deity? O! what is Heav'n! that Day of endless Light? Where Saints shall from th' essential Fountain drink Of Radiance! in God's full, Paternal shine? Ah! what is Hell? of ever-absent Day A Night, all hopeless!—and all endless too! Welcome bright Influence! kindest Gift of HIM Who bid thy Orb of Splendours pour on Earth Life, Health, and Joy! thy warm, thy friendly Ray How grateful! while the vapour-weeping Mead Reeks with chill Mist, an incommodious Track For the rash Trav'ller yet, whose weltring Feet Brush from the plaishy Blades the Tears of Morn. Here let me wander, where, in Fragrance full Or rosy Light, this more inviting Hill Drinks, on his sloping Side, the franker Beam. With pace relax'd the steep Ascent I gain; But gain with Toil—how like the Christian's Path: A sweetly-pleasing, yet laborious Way— And now, how vast a Landskip, kenn'd from hence Breaks on my wilder'd Eye! in roving lost. From Field, Farm, Village, Park, Dale, Stream and Grove! Gay, Primrose Lawns, flaming in vernal Gold, Or Daisie-interlaid, of checquer'd Hues: With Herds and Flocks, wide-feeding round at will. And Woods Night-brown; where ever and anon Some opening Glade I meet, with ranging Troops Of timorous Deer; viewed here, and there, between. And here, and there, a Branch of some fair Stream Silv'ring the Vale; and, over all, the Tops Of sacred Spires, that tow'r in antient State, I catch, at distant Glance; a solemn Sight! Beyond them Thames, her Ocean-hast'ning Flood Throws widely open to the Beam of Heav'n. Her Bosom white with proudly-swelling Sails, That bear her Home the Treasures of the World: Spread, a full Breadth, to gather all the Winds, By the glad Crews, revisiting her Shores. Whose Spirits dance, with Expectation warm, Parents, or Friends, in Transport soon to greet, Consorts, or Children; after absence long. And farther on, in Smallness almost lost Augusta, seen in soft'ning Miniature, O'er a profusive Longitude of Plains, Her hundred Temples rears: Like Needle-Points Uprising slender in th' enbrighten'd Air. Where, in the midst, the Work of Wren St. Paul's., displays It's graceful Dome; and to the West, just spy'd, The Gothic Abbey: Where sepulcher'd, sleeps (Thro' a long Race) the Dust of Albion's Kings. Around I gaze—around—by Raptures tir'd Yet never full—some Object new, and fair, Some fresh-presented Charm, where'er I turn, The Scene expands—and still expands the Scene, With Prospects ever fair, and ever new. But all is seen Below, a Picture spread Beneath my Feet, with nought above but Skies. —So looks the Saint (so ever shou'd he look) On earthly Glories, with his Brow in Heav'n. Hail! Beauties, pencil'd by Omnipotence! Hail! Nature's Concert, pleasing to an Ear In wonder list'ning, to the silent Hymn Ideal heard! sung inward to the Soul From Forms harmonious, this mute Quire of God! Like the feign'd, mystic Musick of the Spheres Unheard, unheeded by Sense-grov'ling Minds. See too! responsive, with her holiest Strains, The Muse awakes; while now the mounting Lark From his green Pallat rous'd, yields lavish Song: Inviting of my Lay, symphonious tun'd, That calls Attention from his sylvan Bower. —Maker of all Things fair! of all Things good! That now, by gross, or mental Sight beheld, Claim Adoration high! thy Power I own! Lib'ral! profuse! benign! confess'd by Knees Thus prostrate bent in Dust; and Hands, and Eyes Turn'd tow'rd thy Throne, in Praise, and kindled Love! O what a Builder! what a Father! here His House has furnished, with unsparing cost, For Man his Creature; his unworthiest Son! For Me of vilest Prodigals most vile! Praise Him! my God, your Maker! praise my King Ye Seasons! that in sweet vicissitude Roll on, of grateful Change: Fresh, vernal Fields That now his Liveries wear of youthful Green! Summer, his fragrant First-born! loveliest deck'd Of all thy Sister-Train; in softest Robes Of Twilights, glistring with pellucid Gold, Thy cheerful Night-Attire; perfum'd in Sweets Of various Flowers: And serv'd in daily State By free-attendant Suns, and waiting Gales! Thou Autumn too! more ripe; in Matron-Charms, Of harvest-Fruits; thy Offspring, large and fair; And hoary Winter! in thy sable Stole Of Storm and Clouds, with ermine Cincture tipp'd Of Mountain Snows! when freezing Vapours pale On the dimm'd Windows dress their mimick Forms: And with rude Bracelets, on the Cob-web'd Wall Pearl the coarse Arrass of Arachne's Loom. From a full Chorus of the quarter'd Year, Praise Him! my God, your Maker! praise my King!— —In your alternate Courses, Eve, or Morn, Be witness! if ingrateful, I forget His wondrous Goodness; or, my Hymn, his praise. Maker of all Things fair! of all Things good! Thine is the Heaven Psalm cxv. 16., the Heaven of Heavens is thine. With their innumerous Host! but the broad Earth, Work of thy Love, has thy rich Bounty giv'n, A large Possession, to the Sons of Men! Strange Bliss has tranc'd me! an extatic Calm! Serv'd, by Devotion, at this Feast of Sense, My Pulse of Joy beats high—Led on the while, In the warm Ardours of Seraphick Zeal, My filial reverent Thoughts still search for Thee Their dear, dear God: as of the Subject, sweet, My Meditation takes her pleasing fill. Where is my Father? where my Maker? view'd In all his Works, conspicuous, free and kind? All view'd? all near? all present?—yet unseen! Where is my God? the wish-impassion'd Mind Has wondrous Power, from farthest-severing Space It's Object to invoke; and, as with Charm Of Magic Spell, make present. Loud my Tongue Repeats a Lesson which, with Solace blest, Was wont to chear me, in my loneliest Walks: When far from every Ear (my list'ning Heart By utter'd Sounds more deeply to impress) Frequent was us'd, in Accents audible My Voice, its lov'd Soliloquy The Meditation. How fragrant is the Air of these delicious Fields! how sweet the surrounding Prospects! furnished out for my Entertainment, by the Hand of the God of Nature. Has he put so much Refreshment into every perfumed Breeze? Crouded such a variety of different, pleasing Colours, Shapes, and Essences into so many little Flowers? Given to such diversity of Fruits and Foods their contrary, yet grateful Flavours? Afforded such innumerable, multiform Prospects to engage the Eye, one single Sense? Such an interchange of Melodies to entertain the Ear? And contrived, by no less than five different Mediums or Senses, to give Gratification to the meer animal Faculties, which are by far the most ignoble Part of me, that I might behold him in this Glass of Nature? This Mirror of Wonders? If I lift my Eyes upwards how shall I conceive of his awful Infinity? Who can place a World, ten thousand Times the Magnitude of ours, at so remote a Distance, as to appear but as a lucid Point, a little twinkling Star? If I bend them downwards, what Instances are every where of amazing Power, that could produce such an Appearance of Order, and Beauty, out of so mean and irregular a Collection of Dust, and Atoms? Hast thou provided such stately Furniture for these lowest Apartments of thy universal Palace, and for thy meanest Attendant? O what then are the Grandeurs that adorn thy Presence Chamber! What, those magnificent Mansions! where thou displayest the pleased Rays of thy beatific Glory, in the higher, and better Worlds! Has created Goodness all these Beauties? A little earthly Spot on which I tread, and gaze (embellished with his least Adumbrations) so fair a Form? Such lovely Charms? O then, how much more infinitely lovely is he, who has given these Things all their loveliness! Who puts into them whatever Sweetness they contain, or can convey! These are but Copies, ah! faint Copies all! of the Goodness of their fair Original. Where is the perfect, uncreated Good? Where the enamouring Image of Loveliness itself? Where is the Original Beauty?—I can discern him in every thing around me: Discover, in every smallest Part of formed Matter, some vestigia of the Deity. The Former of these accomplished Works was also my Former. Where art thou? My all apparent yet unperceived Maker! How shall I hold converse with thee? How approach thee? Am I no better able to conceive of thee than these Trees? Those Brutes? This Clod that bears me? Am I not related to thee by Mind and Spirit? ordained a Priest of this thy mute Creation? Nay, am I not thine, by nearer Relation, and Union? The Brother and Associate, the Lover and Friend, of thy dear incarnate Son? A Member of his Body Ephes. v. 30.? One with him John xvii. 21., and thereby one with thee? Adopted in thy eternal Purpose! Regenerated by thy Spirit, and purchased to thyself by his Blood? Hath he said, I go to my Father and to your Father John xx. 17.? And shall I not then call thee my Father? And may I not converse with thee as a Father? Present every where, present always, present now? While thus I am surrounded with imagined Solitude and Secresy, and meditating, with delight, upon thy beauteous Works. But O! what new Beauties and Pleasures does it put into every Scene, when I consider this World I am now viewing, is a Kingdom of my Father's! Mean as I am in my obscure Condition here, censured, overlooked, or despised, I am yet a royal Child, and the Inheriter of a glorious, a sure, tho' invisible Crown. Let the great vain Men of this Earth take their vanishing Portion; divide this contested Spot, into little, momentary, uncertain Possessions, which they falsly call their own; delude themselves with a conceited Happiness, and adore their sensual Idol. A little, little, little while, and the God I live to, and converse with here, my Father, and my God, will translate me to a State of far higher Honours. It is his good Pleasure to give me a Kingdom, incorruptible, undefiled, and which fadeth not away. (Characters opposite to this changing, polluted, and perishing Scene) reserved in Heaven for me. Here he is training me up by his Spirit, in the Princely Life and Temper, meeting me in the academic Retirements of Groves and Shades, till I am ripened for the opened Glories of my Coronation Day. O! happy Retirement! O! heavenly Solitude! that always affords me the Presence of my Father, and God! where I may at all Times find thee, speak to thee, and receive the delightful Intercourses of thy Converse, and Love. Happy Poverty! where thou, never-failing Fountain of Fulness and Riches! art my inexhaustible Portion. Happy Banishment! that can at no smallest Distance ever separate me from thee. Happy Prison! where thy Society cannot, for one Moment, be excluded. Happy Bed of Sickness! where thou art continually by to cheer and support me. Happy Hour of Death! when my Spirit is expired but only into thy ever circling, and paternal Arms. Happy Condition! extending itself to all Places, all Circumstances, and thro' all Duration. Happy Creature! both here and for ever possessed. of the inseparable, intimate Presence and favour of A God. A Friend, A Father. to breathe. The Prospects cease. For from yon Summit now Insensibly, in wistless Pond'rings! brought The Scenes that charm'd me, late, are view'd no more. How like the Christian still! who ne'er can climb Th' extatic Mount, but soon he treads the Vale Of deep Humiliation—Lo! my Feet, At unawares, a rural, still Church-yard Have enter'd; dark with Elm and Funeral Yew, Scarce ever, but on Holy Festivals Frequented; far from ev'ry public Path: Of Situation loneliest, and obscure. Dread Seat of Death! A Theme which lately Thou Hervey, lov'd Friend! fam'd, sacred Meditant! Hast touch'd so well. Yet useful Lores, tho' less, My humble Genius, haply, may attempt For moral Ears; not noted in thy Plan. See! this large antique Pile! how reverend Grey In hoary Age, it's Walls! and mouldring Tower! With tufted Moss and Ivy rudely hung. From whose high Turrets, now by Years decay'd, Five times, struck deep and slow, the solemn Bell Resounding hoarse, has told the Hour of Morn. These lonesome Walks, of thick, uncouthest Shade, Thro' lengths of Century's past, by turns have clos'd Each Race of Tenants, in the Village round: The wasted Spoils of old Mortality. How wondrous! when the awful Trump of Doom Heard thro' Earth's Realms and Hell, shall start, recloath'd, (Swift as the Motion of the twinkled Eye) Each Form, now chaos'd in this mingled Mass; Mark'd in these Ranks of Graves, and cloystring Tombs. One common Chamber, kept for fellow Dust. None deferenc'd there: dead! in the Pomp of State! State! state in Death! O Mockry too severe For my worst Foe! deep Proof of Pride in Man! How many, without least Memorial left Of whom, or what they were, in this cold Bed Mix in Oblivion, with coeval Clay? Borne like light Bubbles down the Tide of Time; Or Leaves, which Autumn sheds; dispers'd, and lost. Some seek a frail Remembrance, on their Graves: Surviving in a Monumental Life. Alas, how vainly! these brief Registers Scarce more, at best, than barely this relate That once—“a private Name, to Most unknown, “Lived, a short, usual Sum of common Years “With Man—and then—with Man, in common— dy'd.” Meer Folly weak, and Ostentation, poor, Of Self Esteem. Yet striking in its Use, And Doctrinal; that anxious, general Wish Of proud immortal Fame, in mortal Man, Proves, to Man's self, his Immortality. —But who? what Worthy? by Inscription large On this fair Obelisk, with Trophies hung, Asks reverence, from th' admiring Passenger? High, is the Praise bestowed; if haply due. “The fam'd—Benevolent—the strictly Good— “The perfect Christian”—who demands the Palm This Worth confers, of Panegyrick full? —Oh!—turn thy Eyes away, nor view the Name! Of foulest Grain! detestable in Death! Where Virtues shine not, signal, in the Life; View'd in Example, in their Influence felt, 'Tis basest Adulation paid to Dust! 'Tis branding the dead Convict in the Front! 'Tis loud Reproach, 'tis studied Infamy! Abortive Boast! not all the Gloze on Tombs Can saint a Chartres, or make just a Wilde. Who? meanly lodg'd, beneath sepulchral Fence Of native Fir and homely Workmanship, This Tenure claims? with cross-resembled Bones, And weeping Angels, painted on the Wood? “Four lovely Babes,—with their dead Mother, snatch'd “By hasty Fate in Childbed's dolorous Pangs.” Ah! happy Mother! happy Family!— —Yet must I weep—some few, some humane Drops. In pity—to a Father's, Husband's loss!— Your Number, (with the Circumstance) recal My own sad Loss, still felt!—some Tears I weep, Yet are they Tears of Joy.—Safe prove thy Rest Fair, Parent-Shade! and ye, blest Innocents! Ah! sweetly sleep. Your heavenly Sire of such Elects his Kingdom. That bright Multitude On the new Sion view'd by raptur'd John In holy Vision Revel. xiv. 1. to vi.; in whose blameless Mouths (Acknowledg'd without Fault) was found no Guile. Emanuel's Purchase, the first Fruits from Earth Redeem'd to God, his choicest Virgin Train. —Rich Consolation, in few Words express'd, (At the coarse Foot of this plain Tablet wrote) This Motto gives; “Not lost, but gone Before. I have purposely introduced this Passage for the Consolation of pious, mourning Parents: For whom, by severest Experience of the same Trials, I have the tenderest Sympathy. The Scripture, here adverted to, affords the richest Comforts in such afflicting Seasons, the Death of Infants, who no doubt make a very numerous Part of the redeemed Family: Distinguished from the Confessors, described Chap. vi. 9th v.

And seem evidently marked out for Observation in this Place, by the exactest Characters, and fullest Descriptions..” What Fragments of insculptur'd Marble these? Thus scatter'd? thus in Heaps neglected cast? The lordly Ruins of oblivious Time? What do I read!—come here! come here! and learn, Imperious Pride! what says th' insidious Stone? “Here lies the noble.”—Here? hah! where? where lies? Show, if thou canst? where rests th' illustrious Peer? —Behold! behold him! from his Bed of State, His sack'd Mausoleum, dragg'd, disturb'd, and thrown. Mix'd with each Puddle, whirl'd by every Gale, Or, undistinguish'd from Plebean Dirt, Spurn'd unconcernedly, by each Peasant's Heel. O madness of Ambition! vain, vain hope Of Honours, meerly gain'd from Names, or Blood! Unstable Structures, not by Merit rear'd On Virtue's Basis: durable alone. Yet—where is he? what more than Parian Bust, Labour'd with costliest Art, directs my Eye To find the Man, the Man? Ah rather sure The Angel in that Form! who late below, Thro' long Eclipse of gloomiest Poverty, Look'd, yet, so lovely from his suffering Sphere. His life, a Soil where ev'ry heavenly Grace In their full Clusters grew. Zeal, warm while meek By Charity: A Piety most rais'd Yet, an Humility most deep abas'd: Most Patience in worst want: The worthiest, best, Of Christians be, of Fathers, Husbands, Friends. —My Feet have trac'd him out, I recollect The once-known Spot—and liest thou, liest thou here? In this poor Shrine, obscure, of Filth and Weeds! Worthy in noblest Pyramid to rest Of Brass or Gold: whom, claim'd in Skies anon, Bright hov'ring Seraphs shall with Songs attend. —Wait!—sweetly rested.—So may some kind Turf Hide my mean Dust, deserted and forgot; Wrong'd with no Monumental Flattery. Thou pitying Mother, Earth! ah! when? when? when? Shall this try'd Child of Griefs his care-sick Head, (Weary'd with Woes and Frailty) gently sink On thy Grave's kind, cold Pillow? there to rest Fresh for his Bridal, Resurrection-Morn? Period of wish'd Perfection! why recoils My shudd'ring Flesh, at Dissolution's Name? Our Entrance into Life may reconcile The Thought, to Death: entomb'd, before we're born, A living Death; in the Maternal Grave. Death, from the very Cradle, early wooes Our timorous Childhood by his Image Sleep; And lectures Manhood in his nightly School. “But Guilt wakes Fears?”—yet, points a lenient Balm. Look to the bloody Cross! behold thy Cure! To Calv'ry go! view his Aceldema, That sanguine Field! where Death my Saviour fought A Victor bath'd in Gore! and vanquish'd there That All devourer, foul, of Human Race. He conquer'd Sin, by Sufferings, Pains by Smart, And Death, by dying: In his Conflict, there, Conquer'd for thee, and by his Vict'ry, made That stingless Monster his Believer's Friend. Sing, ransom'd Worms! ye Pris'ners, glad, of hope, Shout, shout his Triumphs; your Deliverer's Praise. But O!—O what remains?—a Throne! a Crown! For us! base Aliens! us! his Murderers won! With him deputed Heirs, joint-heirs of Heaven! O! Pow'r, Fruit, Gift of strange mysterious Grace! Abyss! when sathom'd, but more lost—to view A prime Arch-Angel from his golden Orb Fall'n, to a Fiend! a Human Reptile, vile! Rais'd from a frail, weak Infant of a Span, (Guilty as weak) to fill his vacant Throne! And is this Glory mine? It is! it is! O, false Humility! thou Vice disguis'd In specious Dress, of proud, infernal Die, Thou loud Blasphemer of the Truth of Heav'n! That dares the Promise, dares the Oath of God Discountenance, by unbelieving Fear. These Glories all are mine! as sure in Pledge, As if possess'd; when Death the Hour of Joy, That waited, wish'd-for Hour! shall minister My large Induction. Sad, distrustful Heart, No longer droop! live, royaly my Hope! On the full, safe Reversion! O, exult My Faith! my Love! my heavenly-rais'd Desire! My holy Gratitude!—in ev'ry State, In ev'ry View, my Whole of Being blest! Amply while living; amplest, when I die! I quit th' affecting Place, inciting Themes Of too o'er-pressing Weight for mortal Powers. Here let my Thoughts divert awhile; to mark This peopled Rookery: All Abroad on Wing, Each with their several Families employ'd; Training to Industry their callow Broods. To Man how moral! loud it speaks to Man: Man may learn here, that Indolent! his Work, His Duties Task: of helpless Progeny The Care, and Erudition's tender Toil. Man may learn here, that Infidel! to place On Providence his Trust: These all depend On its free Almonry: “Wide dost thou stretch, Preserver kind! thy lib'ral shedding Hand, Munificent, and with Profusion fill, Of ev'ry living Thing, the large Desire.” Psalm cxlv. v. 16. More useful Lesson yet to Man they teach, To Atheist Man, that Monster Rational! One obvious Lesson more important still: Pray'r Nature's Instinct, innate to the Soul, A Tax of Homage on Creation laid, The general Bond on universal Life. Their morning Orisons, their Vespers loud These teach their Young; The Infant Suppliants cry, And ask their Meat from God: how sweetly, hark! Sound their Responses! how devout the Charm!— —And see, the sporting Minstrels! how in Troops They make Excursion; now divide, now join Their sable Columns; travel and return; Yet never jostle in their mazy Flight. While quick observing, thro' their lofty Camp, Their planted Centinel gives warning Signs. Strange Intuition!—cheaply tenanted Free, and at Ease they dwell: content each Day With Nature's Dole, and blest with careless Sleeps, Hous'd in their skiey Chambers, rock'd by Winds. Ah! happy Freemen! ye, your Fields of Air Hold common with ye all. Man, tyrant Lord! Parcels his Speck of Earth, to each small Spot. (Counting mean Self the whole) lays private Claim! And yokes in servile Toils his vassal'd Kind, Distinguish'd scarcely from the vassal'd Brute; Pre-eminenc'd alone, by Birth, in Woe. But lo! a stately Mansion, breaks at once From this short Visto, on th' attracted Eye. Hush'd in deep Silence seem the Houshold Trains: Sunk all, inconscious, in Sleep's wilful Death. Opiate, when us'd undue from Sloth's foul Cup, To wreck Self-murder on the Heav'n-born Thought. Ye Throngs loquacious! with more clamorous Croaks, Call! louder, to these fascinated Roofs, And start th' obscene, Day-dreamers up to Shame. Where am I brought in inobservant Range, By Meditation's Hand led gently on? An Eden sure, a new, lost Paradise, Seems in this blissful Privacy restor'd! Here let me sit: alluring is the Scene, Where the gay Bank spreads, soft, its native Couch Of velvet Verdures, and embroid'ring Flowers. The passing Zephirs from their loaded Wings Lodge their stol'n Fragance here, a Hive of Sweets: Cull'd from the new-cock'd Hay, and blossom'd Bean And honied Woodbine; that with twisting Arms Weds her lov'd Elm in this dark Nuptial Bow'r. In whose cool Cov'ring sits the piping Breeze, With Birds symphonious answ'ring from the Boughs. While, in blue Sedge, and rustic Osier clad, Close at my Foot a River Here follow the Verses promised in the Advertisement before the Work. By Lea's dear Banks, where join'd in Play My Youth's smooth Hours stole pleas'd away, Late wand'ring: by Reflection prest; Thus, taught the Friend, the mental Guest. Sweet Stream! where most my Haunts delight Whose Scenes to solemn Thought invite; May my calm Life resemble thee, Such Pleasure give, so useful be. As passing Straws and buoyant Leaves Thy yeilding Surface, but, receives, While Pearls that lure the searching Eye Deep treasur'd, in thy Bosom lie: May Trifles such Reception find; Float, merely transient, on my Mind, While weightier Thoughts Admission win, Sinks its whole Depths, and rest within. As the large Face the Heav'ns expose Thy pure, reflecting Mirrour shows, Yet paints, in small, terrestial Scenes, Some bordering Flowers or pendant Greens: So, with Resemblances divine, My copying Life direct to shine; While Earth's faint Forms, grown distant—less— Their fewer Images impress. Teach me thy Constancy—to force O'er Barrs, and Streights, a stubborn Course; Not idly in Suspension held— Thy Path not chang'd, tho' oft repell'd. Thy Patience teach my ruffled Soul, When, like thy Waves, its Motions roll: Who vex'd to foam, while Passions fray, Gentle, in Smiles soon pass away. Teach me thy Rule of temp'rate Bliss, Pleas'd, just thy flow'ry Banks to kiss: Yet by no Sweets allur'd aside, Till Ocean stops thy restless Tide. O may'st thou Pattern wise dispense, Mod'rate to taste the Charms of Sense! Still pressing to my wish'd Abode, Nor fix'd, till at my Centre—God. gently strays: It's Murmurs rolling to a neighb'ring Wood. Beneath whose quiv'ring Shade, the sunny Beams Dance on the checquer'd Stream, with shifting Light; And in its Mirrour show the finny Tribes, That o'er the shining Pebbles make their Chase. And, farther off, appears again at large The wand'ring Current; turning oft aside His Husband-Flood to kiss the Consort-Mead; And with her Offspring play, of smiling Flowers. He, from his wealthy Affluence, pleas'd relieves A thousand happy Objects in his Way; Yet, his own, kindred Banks leaves ever full. Rich in his Fountain, like the lib'ral Hand, He gains by giving: and his crystal Breast Grows, by his Alms dispens'd, more sweet and pure. While (like vast, standing Lakes) contracted Minds Pent up, amassing for themselves alone, Infectious turn: more fœtid by their Store. How, all unchang'd, by Lengths of Ages past, These silver Tides have kept their stated Course! The Sea, that takes their Tributes, feeds their Springs. While proudest Tow'rs, that once these Banks adorn'd, Long since, are moulder'd in their pristine Dust. Strange Contradiction! Things in flux, their Forms Hold permanent; Things fix'd, by Time expire. Just so, the restless Soul that ever moves Tow'rd God its Centre, from his Ocean finds Encreas'd Supplies; when Carnalists, on self Proud-settling, feel their false Foundations sapp'd— Sunk—in their own Dilapidations lost. The Vale has catch'd my Eye; where thro' the Brake, At Distance-small descry'd, a spacious Waste Of stateliest Ruins tempts my Feet away. Long desolate: in superstitious Times An Abbey fair; with wandring-Cloysters-large, And Tow'rs broad-rear'd, and entring-Arches-wide, And Walks, long-bowring once, of sweetest Shade, All winding pleasant by a fishy Stream. Ah! happy Country! from thy dreadful Thrall Releas'd; of Errour's Night, and mental Chains. Christ and his Truths were lost: our bigot Sires In the dark Chambers of their Imag'ry, Serv'd Idols: falsly deifying thee Mary, blest Virgin (blest, tho' unador'd) Stil'd, Queen of Heaven, and Mother (strange!) of God. Plain Name of Blasphemy; when Mother, pure, Not of Christ's Godhead, but of Christ the Man. Then Mediator Saints (some, while on Earth Least saintly) were invok'd; while he, pronounc'd Sole Mediator, with his Righteousness By Faith alone imputed, was displac'd For legal Works of Merit; falsly taught To justify: Rome's gainful Mart for Gold. Crafts, to serve priestly Av'rice, Pride and Pow'r. And, are there who that vile detested Yoke Wou'd re-impose I should be deeply concerned if, by any misconstruction, these Lines should be thought to reflect on a Sacred Order of Men, for whom I have, in common, the most real, affectionate Esteem. All religious Ceremonies, agreeing with gospel Simplicity, in our protestant established Church. All Stations of Dignity, Profit, &amp;c. conducing either to the Credit or comfortable Discharge of the ministerial Function, the extending any Sphere of Usefulness, or that are the just Rewards of Piety and Merit, are far from being design'd as a least Part of the Subject in this Reprehension. Such Abuses of the holy Office, as I have only glanced at, are the Grief of all worthy Ministers and good Men. The securest Heart may tremble at the Denunciations, which God hath himself express'd, (six times in ten Verses) against such mercenary, idle and rapacious Shepherds. Ezek. xxxiv. from 1. to v. 11. Milton has a Passage, in his Lycidas, exactly correspondent with mine; applied wholly to a Clergy of this corrupt, scandalous, and carnal Stamp. ? Such, as for their Bellies sake Creep, and intrude, and climb into the Fold. Of other Care they little Reck'ning make, Than how to scramble at the Shearer's Feast, And drive away the worthy bidden Guest; Blind Mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold A Sheep-hook, or have learn'd ought else the least. That to the faithful Herdsman's Art belongs! What recks it them? what need they? they are sped; And, when they list, their lean, and flashy Songs Grate on their scranel Pipes of wretched Straw. The hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed, But, swoln with Wind, and the rank Mist they draw, Rot inwardly, and foul Contagion spread: Besides what the grim Wolf with privy Paw Daily devours apace; and nothing said—, by vain un-gospel Rites? Who Souls misled wou'd on Repentance rest For Life? and Duties of defective Law? Hirelings? that make for Gain the Saviour's Church A worldly Kingdom? that meer Titles seek? And hunt for carnal Profits, Sloth, and Ease, In rich Pluralities! who famish'd leave The pining Flock, and cloath them with their Wool? Lord of thy Israel! these intruding Wolves Cast from thy Fold!—to dress thy Vineyard send Try'd, faithful Labourers by blest Lucre mov'd, Large Wages seeking in, not for, their Work. Holy, Regenerate, Humble;—deep, best learn'd, From inward Teachings, in thy Spirit's School. Striving, alone, who most with Zeal, with Love Shall burn for Jesus, in their Toils for Men. What sudden Warnings give the must'ring Clouds That lour, tempestuous, in the alter'd Air? Beasts their close Coverts, Birds their shadiest Trees Affrighted seek, the March of instant Storm Presaging sure. It points this Way—'tis come! Deep groans th' Ear-rending Thunder, that compels My speedy Flight: For Shelter, poorly sought Amid these bowing Roofs, and dropping Walls; And dark sunk Caverns, for the Foot unsafe: The Toads foul Nurs'ry, and the drear Resort Of lurking Adders, and th' ill-boding Owl. Thro' whose torn Clefts the haunting Echoes rave With Peals more horrid, and of hoarser roar. Hark! how the Rains in streaming Torrents burst! While livid flash the mix'd sulphureous Flames, Soon follow'd by new Vollies from the Skies. A dreadful fight of jarring Elements: The Strife of Waters, with the Rage of Fire. In that one Voice, now rais'd, what Terrors spoke! Again!—more loud it grows.—And shall I fear A Father's Thunder? will his lightning harm A Child? a Fav'rite? in his fond, fond Heart Lodg'd, watch'd, remember'd; by as quick a Sense As the touch'd Pupil of the feeling Eye. Are not his Angels here? my royal Guard On kind Commission sent. Himself is here! Himself! in ev'ry State of Conflict found My help! my Saviour, nigh! my present God! And shall I fear? tho' Nature swift were seiz'd With her expiring Pang; tho' Hell should arm, And hemm'd I stood, with ghastliest Furies round? Roar on, ye Thunders! flash, ye Lightnings now! On this untrembling Breast! 'mid all your Threats, Compos'd to sweetest Peace; while calm'd, assur'd, By the felt Pledges, of a Father's Love. —Try, Unbeliever! how thy Bulrush-Hope Will bear thee; in an Hour of stormy Fears; In Calm, in Courage like the Christian's Trust! The Wreck comes near, in that thick, dun-red Cloud, Full o'er my Head impended: big, and low. Guard, gracious Heav'n! how direful was that Crack! As if Earth's Poles were rift, and in her Doom Heav'ns whole Artillery was discharg'd at once. And—hah!—behold, the Havock, see this Oak Close at my Side! that, but a Moment past, Stretch'd his proud, vaunting Arms, himself a Wood, Long Proof to all, the Elemental War: Scath'd by the nitrous Blast, his knotted Trunk In mangled Fragments strew'd, torshivers riv'd; With all his antient Honours laid in Dust!— So near its Fate, why miss'd the fiery Death In my pierc'd Heart to drink the vital Stream? Thy Care, all watchful, thy love rescuing Arm, Preserver dear! in prostrate Homage prais'd. Fix, the deep Voice of Providence, my Thoughts Of thy vindictive Pow'r. Whose less alarm London! thy shook Metropolis has felt, (Oh! had it shook more Hearts!) which, yet so fresh, Suggests a Theme, not devious, for my song. Still rose the Morn; Security had lull'd, The flatter'd Sons of Vice in false Repose. Heav'n of its dread Intent no Portents gave; Ah! too, too obvious in our gen'ral Crimes. Pleasure had lent to Time her silken Wings; And, to her Syrens, danc'd his wanton Hours, Thoughtless of Change. Mirth wore her liveliest Smile, And Ease sat; listless, on Augusta's Walls. When, instantaneous, Earth's huge, cumb'rous Mass Heav'd, with strange Pang, and deep resounds her Groan. All, at the signal, rouse—but stretch them soon In Folly's dallying Lap, and hush their Fear. The Month her Circle had in Pastimes clos'd, Again—another—a repeated Shock, A louder Voice, of Horror more severe, Starts the dead Slumb'rers from their impious Dream. Where sly the threaten'd Wretches? where? where, now, For wish'd Relief?—To suppliant Penitence? To Fasts? to Mournings? to the House of Pray'r? A Posture due—Ah! no. To Plays! to Sports! To midnight Revels! nearest match'd in Guilt To those of Fiends; the Jubilee of Hell! Hear it not, Strangers! our Disgrace outbraves All Parallel; in two, amazing Days! On each, an Earthquake! and on each a Ball! Has Man his Hours in charge? important trust! All lent? all number'd? all with duty tax'd? In Sloth to rust? in Luxury to waste? To lose, in sensual Feculence, at will? Like hardy Gamesters, desp'rate in their Play! What are their rank Amours? that dare the Sun In Day's broad Eye? amid the num'rous Stews (Affronting, with Impunity, our Streets?) Of shameless Youth the fashionable Schools? All Order, Ties, Relations, Heav'n's wise Law Made the Drole's laugh, and broke, for Modes of Sin. What are their Meetings, at the swinish Board Of boasted Fellowship, their roaring Bands! But Circe's Monsters, wallowing o'er their Trough? What, their Assemblies? for Politeness fam'd! Nurs'ries of Pride, and leud Intrigue, and fraud In lavish Play; base lust, of furtive Gold! Health, Innocence, and precious Minutes, lost! Immortal Minds amus'd o'er painted Toys!— View it not, Angels! to enhance your Scorn Of Man; already in your Sight too mean. Oh—Britain!—oh!—maternal, weeping Land! These are thy Christians! sham'd by Pagan Climes, These thy sad Prospects! this thy hopeless Race! Mature for Ruin!—should the dreaded Blow Seize them, immers'd in Acts of daring Sin! Should Heav'n its Scenes of Horror, then, disclose; The yawning Earth! sunk Street! and cracking Pile! —Hark!—'tis at Hand!—prepare to meet thy God! Thy God, O Britain! thy tremendous Judge! Thy Judge incens'd! Omnipotence in Wrath! A dreadful Foe! he speaks—but spares the Stroke; Love wrests the Vengeance from his lifted Arm. O, timely be attentive! hear! hear! hear His monitory Voice! his awful, loud, Yet gentle Call!—mild Saviour! friend of Man! Pour, in large Streams, thy soft'ning Spirit down, To melt the native Rock of human Hearts! Dear, bleeding Advocate! our hapless State Commiserate, all gracious; bow thy Ear Pitying to suppliant Dust! thy People's Pray'rs, The Matrons Tears, our Infants helpless Cries, Invoke thee, “Oh, avert! avert our Doom!” The Storm is ceas'd—The Thunders know their God, And still their roar. O! how severe is felt His Frown in Nature, tho' his Frown of Love! Each Prospect mourns! from all the languid Tribe Of weeping Flow'rs, and ev'ry dripping Tree. Soon shall your short-soil'd Beauties be repair'd, By glossier Lustres, and more spic'd Perfumes, For see! the Sun his fresh-refulgent Rays Pours on the Skirt of yon soft fleecy Cloud That form a shadowy Arch of dazzling Lifts: Gay Yellow, emerald-Green, and morning-Red, Aurora's Blush; a shining Zone, engrain'd In Tints of Heav'n. With whose sweet Aspect pleas'd, God (in remembrance of sworn Amity With Earth established, and perpetual League,) Gracious will look; his Cov'nant-Symbol Genesis ix. v. 16. compared with Isaiah liv. v. 9. own'd Of Peace, and full-exterminated Ire. Birds raise their joyous Song; and Flocks and Kine Thro' the shower'd Meads for savoury Banquet roam. All is a State of Love, no Quarrels here Divide the diff'rent Polities: The Boar Feeds at full Range beside the Labourer Ox, With the tame Steed the Lamb free Pastures share, Man only, Feud foments, proud, factious Man, The Savage, lordly Wrangler of the World. Such pleas'd Surveys of Nature's wondrous Frame Suit well the Sanctity of holiest Time; And shall the Bigot, of censorious Stamp The Christian brand? who, contemplating thus, His early Lot or late of hallow'd Hours In rural Wandrings spends? depriv'd the Means Of Closet-Thought, by Circumstances strait Of numerous Offspring, or the Want of Place In Houshold Privacy. Acquiring here (Besides a Mind, more sooth'd to heavenly Calm) Brac'd Nerves, rais'd Appetite, and purer Blood: The Tides fast pouring in of Health, and Joy. Corp'ral with mental Good.—away! ye gloom'd, O'er-rigid Race! stiff Pharisees in Creed! Who gospel-Saints by sabbatary Forms Would bind; that Vassalage of legal Rest. Like me (e're hardness of degenerate Hearts Compell'd strict Jewish-Law) in Hebron's Field Accepted Isaac, at accustom'd Eve Walk'd forth to meditate: and him ador'd Lord of his Sabbath, Man's Exemplar blest, He, (like his mean Disciple) thro' the Paths Of tow'ring Corn, or some lone, shade-top'd Hill, Took, social or apart, his devious Way. Safe Rule: If not from him his Follower swerve. One Duty of the solemn Day is paid: The meet Remembrance of Creation's Works. But, Works more Godlike, more transcendent far, (A weightier Debt, a dearer Duty still!) Claim my full Sum of wondring, grateful Thoughts: So ever, still, in paying ne'er to pay. A World, miraculous like this, to make A Word it cost! but one prolific Word! But ah! th' Almighty Maker's Life itself Was paid, that World from Ruin to redeem. God stoop'd to Suffrings, for his Creature's Sin! Oh! that at once to him Exod. xxxiii. 18, and seq. (tho' not in Grace In Name resembling) thou to me would'st deign (Hid in the Clift of thy spear-open'd Side) In Trance thy passing Deity to view!— See me, thou meek incarnate Majesty! With aw'd Request bow'd deeper than in Dust: And thy free Spirit send, they purchas'd Gift, In my Mind's Glass the Vision to reveal: Some faint, short Glimpse, thy Glories hindmost Parts, My Morning-Wandrings last, but sweetest Theme. What may not ransom'd Man provided see In the rich Covenant I would recommend it to all Persons under Conviction, and others, to read deliberately over Ezek. c. xxxvi. from the 20 v. to the End. Compared with Heb. c. viii. from v. 6. to v. 13., by Redemption wrought? His whole of Bliss secur'd; the Means and End: All his wish'd Blessings, treasur'd safe in thee Thou, Lord of Angels! but the Sinners Friend! Ah! more, his Kinsman, in fraternal Bonds! Where shall the guilt-convicted Creature fly? Scorch'd thro', and stunn'd, with thund'ring Sinai's Curse? To Works? That Law, that first convinc'd of Sin! The Dead to work? meer Carcass, void of Strength: Shut up, long putrid, in Corruption's Grave. “But he may seek to Mercy,”—Mercy! where? The Sword of fiery Justice waving guards That Gate, made inaccessible to Guilt. Show, if thou canst, without a Ransom giv'n, A Satisfaction adequate and full, Show, in a Way becoming Deity, Mercy with Justice reconcil'd to Man: Join Truth, that threatens Punishment, with Love. What must he do?—“In deep Repentance plung'd, Cleans'd, and abluted come.”—Ah! proud Deceit! Repentance is the Child of fruitful Faith: Not its Progenitor, as falsly taught; (Twin-Virtues, rather, in the heavenly Train.) Come as thou canst: Just, loathsome as thou art; For a free Pardon, held thee out by Grace. Like the bare Prodigal Luke c. xv. v. 20. in all thy Filth Take the blest Boon!—me in my Blood he found, (Blotted all thro' with ev'ry Spot of Hell, Trembling, condemn'd, in my own Thoughts, undone) And cleans'd me in the Fountain of his own. With all my Fears, to him, when lost, I turn'd; And felt him soon my Peace, and feel him still, (With his abiding Unction 1 John c. ii. v. 27. richly show'r'd) A vital Head of Influence own'd, to me His meanest Member: a weak Foot, defil'd, Of that blest Body; often warp'd aside, And turn'd away. Like the Sap-gendring Vine Nurt'ring his grafted Branch, from him I draw Growth, Sustenance, and Fruits. Ev'n Ills I feel, (Such, in their Nature) op'rating in Good. Blest is Temptation (not provok'd nor sought) That makes me but more watchful. Blest, I deem Afflictions; helping in their Exercise My Work of perfect Patience, Ev'n my Lusts, The Strivings of my old Corruption blest; That drive me more to Jesus, drive me there For Purity and Strength; all stor'd in him. Push'd off by hostile Legions, safe I stand Safe in the Covenant; in that Hold secure. That Hold! not mine of him, but his of me. And mayst thou not, Believer! clear'd, absolv'd, Lov'd, sanctified, and seal'd, thy purchas'd Heav'n By safe Assurance hold? and take thy Seat Now Ephes. c. ii. v. 6., in celestial Places?—Gospel Sons (Not shall, but do) have enter'd in that Rest Heb. c. iv. v. 3.. Their present Privilege, tho' to most unknown. “Who? what high Fav'rite, more than Man, enjoys A Charter so peculiar?” Multitudes! Arriv'd at filial Liberty. A Right Faith's weakest new-born Babe may safely claim. All who in Christ believe, all ought, all may; Who yield not blindly to the specious Guile Of Carnal Reasonings, and base Unbelief: False, wandring Fires, that lead in misty Night The lost, sad Pilgrim, foul, and far, astray. Is this th' immortal, emulating Prize! A Palm, for contest set to human Race! And will the Child, (by Passions nurs'd and Dreams) Bent on a present Portion, pine for Earth In frensied Wish, and hug his bawble-World? What is Ambition, but base Discontent With what we are? What, Pleasure? but a Foam, By the mad Torrent rais'd, of rapid Sense! Beauty? what more, than an external Toy? Those that possess it, too, enjoy it least! Worn but for others! Guilt's Asylum, Gold, What? a false Shadow, of as false a Good! Fame, what? and Titles?—Breath! and empty Names! What, Learning? but the Boast, with Labour gain'd, Of knowing something?—that was known before! And are these worth a Wish! an anxious Sigh! Thy chief Solicitude! which claims it best? (Count, sensual Soul! revolve it oft, and deep!) A Portion, spent on Earth? or stor'd, in Heav'n? Th' important Difference, scan! deliberate! weigh! Note the vast, vast, Disparity! between A Portion, hastning from! or hastning to! But hark! from all the distant Hamlets round, The lively Bells have rais'd their early Peals To welcome in the Feast of holy Joy. The due Regards of Household Piety Betimes exciting; ere their ready Trains, On Sound more gravely solemn, all convene In the full House of Pray'r, and Hearts commix In Adorations social; reverent hear His Message Christ's Evangelist unfold, Rejoyc'd, with Fellow-Saints: One homeward Stage Brought onward, happily, to native Skies; A Sabbath's-Journey in their Way to Heav'n. What holds me then, but that with instant Pace, On the first Summons, earliest, I return? In the joint Duties timely to engage Of household Piety; 'till with the Trains, Call'd on more solemn Service, I convene In the full House of Pray'r; with Heart commix'd In Adorations social: reverent hear His Message Christ's Evangelist unfold Rejoycing; while in Saintly-Fellowship To native Skies, in nearer Prospect still, Brought sweetly on, a Homeward Stage I reach: One Sabbath's-Journey, on my heavenly Way. So if an Eaglet (practising for Strength His wand'ring Wing) in mid Excursion hears The careful Mother-Bird her Son recal: To her known Signal back he speeds at once, And on her Plumes, in Flight celestial borne, High to the Sun on safer Pinnions soars. The End of the First Part. THE Sacred Public Duties, PART II. With those of the Family and Solitude. CONTENTS. Sunday, waking Reflections on the Advantages and Blessings of a Divine Revelation. The first Sabbath's Institution, with the Reasons of its Change. The Devotions of the Closet and Family, recommended. An Invitation to the Communion of Saints. A Digression hereupon, to Mr. Hervey and Dr. Young. On approaching the public Ordinances. Several Subjects of a Gospel Ministry enlarged on; with the Celebration of the two Christian Sacraments. The right Improvement of holy Time after a Return from the sacred Assemblies, and a moral, pathetic Complaint of the general Neglect and Abuses of it, and of our corrupt, irreligious Manners. Concluding with a suitable, solemn, and interesting Contemplation. As one, belated on some perilous Road, (Whom, a fresh Rumour of Night-Murder done Thrills with sad Damp) at his own Tread dismay'd Stops listning oft, then speeds him faster on: If in the Window of some friendly Lodge His Eye, at length, discerns a Taper's Gleam, His Hope revives, fresh Courage steels his Heart. So on his Way the heavenly Pilgrim bent: Thro' the World's Waste, this howling Wild of Prey, (Kept by the Murderer Satan fast in quest) Looks to the Lamp of Gospel Promises; In fainting Fears his Sustentation sweet, Of Cordial full; with God his saving Strength, A Shield to fend, a Sun to light and cheer; With Christ, by gracious Imputation made His Righteousness; that white imperial Robe By Saintly-Sp'rits Regenerate worn, and pure: Espous'd by Faith to Heaven's sole Heir the Lamb. And in his Breast the holy Comforter Inhabiting, with evidential Seals, What shall he dread? tho' (from his Father's Home Absent and far) Hell's Snares in Ambush thick Beset his Path, what shall God's Fav'rite dread? Thro' his worst Thralls assur'd to persevere. The high Creator had his six Days Works In Man compleated, Man the Crown of all; Gracious, his seventh, th' approving Architect (Not with that dread Solemnity with which On thund'ring Sinai he promulg'd his Law In Majesty of Terrour) view'd the Plan All beauteous, and his hallow'd Rest ordain'd. When our new Parents on his Sabbath's Morn Existence, with Devotion's Acts began: And eucharistic Sacrifice first paid To their kind Former. Then the Morning Stars, (Bright, eldest Servants of th' empyreal Courts) Together sang, and with symphoneous Shout From all his Worlds, the Sons of God rejoic'd. O! what a Sabbath that of heavenliest Bliss! Angels, and Man on Earth, and God with Man Inharmonis'd; the only such perhaps By unfal'n Adam known, elaps'd so soon. (Such the redeem'd, eternal, yet shall know) But this, soon darken'd, by our first Offence, Long since, the risen Saviour hath annul'd. (Lord of the Sabbath Mark ii. 28., tho' the Son of Man) That, soil'd, exchanging for his brighter Day. Long cou'd not Death in weak-impris'ning Bands (Impossible) the Lord of Life detain; Nor the vain priestly Seal, nor Roman Watch. (Pick'd Veterans, besure, of stoutest Heart; No doubt inspected too by mingling Spies Of Jewish Zealots, curious for th' Event; The Priests themselves, perhaps, or trusted Friends) Availess all; th' appointed third-days Morn (First of the Week) had scarce unbarr'd the Skies, Ere from th' etherial Portal downward sped Th' Arch-Angel, on Commission, vast, dismiss'd From Sov'reign Justice satisfy'd, to loose, In full Display of due, judicial Form, Our law freed Surety. With his Presence mov'd, Earth, aw'd, and trembling for her guilty Sons Deep at her Centre quak'd; while from the Tomb. Back, in resentful Look, the pond'rous Stone He roll'd: And on it with terrific State Sat sternly passive, full in dreadful View: Like Lightning shone his Visage, and his Robes Of heavenliest Lustre foil'd th' unsullied Snow. Where are the dauntless Guards? convuls'd with Fear All shiv'ring, struck to Earth like lifeless Men! Not so weak Mary, (Women, strong in Faith, Shall shame a Host of trembling Infidels.) Ah happy Females! as by Woman first Came mortal Woe, so Tidings now of Life, To Eve's recover'd Sons, ye first shall bear In risen Jesus. Lo! the Lord appears; Before the rest, to favour'd Magdalene; (Oft finds the guiltiest Sinner signal Grace) Then to th' Eleven, on the next First Day Eve Met all for Prayer, convincive to the Test Of Sight and Touch. Full forty blissful Days Conversing, was he seen; revealing Laws Of his new Kingdom Acts i. 3., when his little Flock To Bethany he led, ascending thence With words of Blessing, visibly to Heav'n; So Acts i. 11. to return again to waiting Saints. Hail Morn! more sacred than Creation's Light, When Jesus rose! accomplishing a Work In Man's Redemption happier than his Birth. Thee, holier Sabbath, may I rise to hail! To sing thy Honours, and reprove a World Forgetful of its Saviour! O what Pangs My secret Thoughts have felt! the Griefs to view Of slighted Sion; in the hallow'd Rest Of Christ, dishonour'd! Now let Pity move, (Let large Philanthropy for erring Man) To win the Wand'rer from the Path of Death. And thou, dear Spirit of God! so wont to bless The Day of Jesus, quickning with thy Pow'r The sin-dead Soul, regenerate by thy Word: O! Teacher, Friend, and Comforter of Saints, Smile on my Work of heart-felt Charity; That to thy Influence, some at least, some Breast May melt, and Angels taste a new-caus'd Joy. Christ's holy Pilgrim! wake! a Brother's Voice Alarms thee, 'tis thy Duty's friendly Call. Break from thy temperate Rest of Nature pure. Of freest Thought, of stillest Silence calm, Of sought Retirement 'tis thy choicest Hour. In Secresy (like Moses) first thyself Ascend the Mount alone, and prostrate there With God, thy own, thy dear, thy vast Concerns Transact; and taste the Parent-Kiss divine. Then, mild, assemble next thy Houshold Charge, (If Heav'n has will'd thee in a Trust so high) Them to the Throne conduct, together bend, Commingled Interests, banded in one Work, One little, sweet Society of Love. Their Morning Sacrifice, the great High Priest Receiving, on his golden Altar laid, Shall with his Incense offer; and return The quested Blessings, from auspicious Skies. See, on Augusta's tall, ascending Spires The Lamp of Morn has shot his whitening Beam. Fair Structures, rear'd for blest Religion's Use. But where the living Temples shall I seek Of God? where most his Presence loves to dwell, Where Man? the favourite Sanctuary of Heav'n! Some on the Bed of Sloth, in Sleep supine False Rest indulging, or in Wine's mad Dream Fast captiv'd, or the Folds of deadly Sin. Some wakeful with th' Alarm of worldly Care, Base Mammon; or on roving Pleasures call'd Ill-tim'd, th' all holy Season to profane. Can I not find the few? the pious few? (Ah were their Numbers more!) whose Hearts prepar'd, In Secret join the Fellow-Saints Above, Leagu'd in their blest Employs, and well approv'd By their all-seeing, gracious Father's Eye? Can I not mix in Spirit with their Train? Lift from dull Earth my Thoughts? from sensual Scenes? And soar with kindred Minds to long'd-for Heav'n? Dear Hervey! oft, with whom communing sweet, Our Souls associate (twin-born Souls are ours) Cast in one Mould, cemented by one Taste, Wrought to one Likeness, temper'd in one Flame, Nurs'd by one Judgment, tutor'd to one Theme. Dear, as if present to my visual Sense, (Myst'ry of vulgar Minds) e'er ever seen; How since endear'd! the Pow'rs of readiest Speech An Eloquence like thine, would fail to tell. Now absent, in ideal Sight retain'd, With Friendship like fraternal Sympathy. Where e'er thy long expected Labour new, (Rich in choice Art,) thy Judgment meliorates With height'ning Touches, delicate and pure, In Prose, Ear-rapturing as the Voice of Song. O might I but acquire thy happy Vein! Correct as that cou'd teach, persuade, and please, In the Love-impuls'd Thoughts that move my Lay! And thou! with ev'ry grateful Honour nam'd, Last-living Glory of the British Muse, Her Chariots! Horsemen! all her Grace and Strength! Like the great Tishbite, almost left alone The Prophet of thy God: whom, humbly aw'd I follow, and thy Steps at Distance trace. While, long the gentle Thomson laid in Earth, Fair shrin'd, beneath his own fresh Laurels rests, Shall I, O Young! conversing with thy Art, My languid Taper kindle at thy Sun? And flowing Numbers, Piety Heart-warm'd Pathetic Tumult, all the Soul of Verse, Nerv'd copious Sentiment, and quick'ning Fire Catch from thy Page? whose single Worth shall save The Genius of dishonour'd Poesy: From barbarous Bands, the Vandal and the Goth (To sink our Morals, with our Sense and Taste) In squalid Legions swarming from the Press, Like Egypt's Monsters, from the Mud of Nile. If I with You, frail Adam's Sons at best, In one original Pravation born! If We, by Faith's elucidating Beam, Heav'n-favour'd, have discern'd our Nature's Thrall, Her Sickness, Impotence, and Bleeding Cure, Which her Pride will not, Blindness cannot see, Shall Pity be deny'd her Suit humane For kindred Bondmen? Brethren, yet in Chains? Shall not the feeling Heart, the weeping Eye The suppliant Knee, their Succours intercede? Their Freedom, at the Mediatorial Throne? The awful Time advances, and requires Our earliest Presence at the Temple's Gates. How meet the Service, when the solemn Hour Calls to the House of Prayer, God's earthly Courts! How dear th' assembled Family of Heav'n, All Children of One Father, round the Throne Presenting large their Wants, with joint Address, By the lov'd Lord, their elder Brothers Heb. ii. 11. 12. Hands! How sweet to waft the Hymn of grateful Praise, Loud Melody of Sion, and attend The gracious Preacher, dropping Manna down, The Bread of craving Souls. O fix me then! (The heav'nly Dew thick-showering round my Tent) Not in the Form of light Philosophy; Those Metaphysic Figments crude and bold, The Stagyrite's Dogma, or Platonic Dream; Root to foul Heresies of eldest Growth. Nor seat me, list'ning in Attention waste On windy Sounds, the Rhetorician's Charm; Or modish Reasoner's proud Theology: When the meer moral Lesson aims to sooth With Eloquence the vainly curious Ear. Dead, tasteless Letter; which the heathen School Of Seneca, or Tully, better teach, Than dares best modern Orator to boast. But place me where the true Evangelist, Christ's Minister, the Gospel Page unfolds, Full of Experience; where the piercing Word May find the Sinner's Pride, and lay him deep In humbling Terrors of the killing Law. Then Faith, Repentance then, both Gifts of Heav'n, Once deem'd so easy, seem his hardest Task. Conviction gives no Power to conquer Sin, The Work alone of Grace, this lets him see His Danger, Wants, Dependance, Weakness, Strength. Fresh from the Stores of sovereign, healing Love The Blood of Jesus, ease-renewing Balm To wounded Hearts, the kind Physician brings, A welcom'd Cure; and lets th' Offender know (Led thro' his Struggles of the second Birth) Life-pleading Faith, that justifying Act, (An empty Hand to clasp a tender'd Gift) Faith (in its Object's Merit, not its own) Shall win his Pardon with th' indulgent King: His Pardon ample, everlasting, free: (That can, ere Works, Rom. iv. 5. th' Ungodly justify, Yet God be just: Christ's royal Donative, His, made by Purchase, all by Gift made ours.) Free, to the Chief of Sinners, to the Brand Half-burning pluck'd from Hell, so large his Boon To Man, tho' loaded with the worst of Crimes. O Root of Hope! O Proof of heavenly Grace, Too inconceivable for Worms below! Behold! the Caitiff, (once) and view him chang'd; How wond'rous! him, a sentenc'd Rebel late, A Favourite now, belov'd! long Foe to God, Now dearest Friend! a native Child of Wrath, And now an Heir adopted! late a Slave Of abject Hell, now own'd a Prince of Heav'n! So if the Passenger some stately Pile, Majestic Work, beholds, with vaulting Domes, And Columns Tuscan or Corinthian, rear'd Where Desart late was seen, or Ruins waste, He stops, in Pleasure fix'd, in Wonder aw'd; And owns the beauteous Transmutation strange, Effect of Skill divine, of Godlike Pow'r. Droop not, dejected Convert, oft' to feel Corruption's rising Strife: True Christian Peace Is earn'd by sharpest Toil. Faith must have Proof: Heav'n always tries its Gift. Thy Fight, tho' hard, Tho' long, (thro' many a Foil with deep Dismay Sustain'd) the Truth will show of inward Grace: Grace by its Trials only can be known. Distrust thy own frail Power, but keep thy Eye On thy great Captain for victorious Strength; Fenc'd round by his Almighty Panoply More shalt thou be than Conqu'rer, hardier grow Thy holy Courage; then shall Joy divine, Raptures unknown, dilate thy ravish'd Heart, Known but to Saints, the Foretastes of their Heav'n. So when foul Night enraps the louring Air In hideous Shade, the Winds with rocking Gust Tempestuous Roar: while from the warring Clouds Blaze livid Lightnings, and in frequent Peals Bursts the dread Thunder—if at welcome Dawn In radiant Calm ascends the smiling Sun, All Nature opes her Sweets. the Fields and Flowers, Drest in fresh Blooms, unusual Brightness wear, And cheer the Senses with redoubled Charm. Want'st thou unchang'd Tranquility below, Life without Storm, a holy, pure, serene? 'Twou'd not be Earth: A State like this is Heav'n: The golden Age of a fair World to come. Sin, still in-dwelling, the regen'rate Mind Oft combats; struggling for divested Power: And rallying, with a Tyrant's desp'rate Rage Encaptiv'd leads the Saint, too prone to yield. But then the Pangs it costs him! what Remorse Descriptionless, at ev'ry sad Review! The deep-renew'd Repentance! warm with Faith, That vital Principle, that ne'er shall fail. His pitying Father in his Book records His Sighs, and counts his safe-embottled Tears Psal. lvi. 8.. Yet this shall work his Good, by ruling Grace Rom. viii. 28.. This lights up self-Acquaintance, opens more His Labyrinth-Folds within, of hid Deceit. His Nature's dread Revolt, his Guilt's Deserts, His helpless Misery, tells, Corruption's Taint, Black, ulcerous Sore, of Depth unsoundable; The leprous Heart's hereditary Plague. This the divine Physician more endears, Shows him his Skill, his Faithfulness, his Love; In-taught Experience gives him, of the Worth Of his rich Pleadings, Righteousness, and Blood: This keeps him humble, watchful more in Prayer; Made, like Antæus, stronger by his Falls. His Slips direct him (Sea-marks, set to warn A safer Course) experienc'd how to steer. So if, enamouring Sense, a verdur'd Path, Flatt'ring with water'd Walks, and arching Bowers, For deadly Snare by some Enchanter made, The Trav'ler lures from his intended Way, Till the black Clouds appear, and setting Sun, The conscious Wand'rer, sad in lost Dismay, Turns back in Haste, his happy Road to gain; Then marks each Step with more suspicious Care. Judge not (too rash) thy State, by present Frames; Faith has its Flows, its Ebbs, and Dormancy: May doubt like Thomas, may like Peter fall; Its Habit safely six'd, its Acts unsure. (Hypocrisy has oft her Fit of Zeal) Wait on the Spirit's Witness, Truth to clear By Luminations of th' unerring Word. So on the Dial's Plane insculptur'd lie The Hours unnotic'd, till the lucid Beam Points to th' Enquirer out his Stage of Day. Be oft' in self-Inspection, know thyself; (Next thy blest Maker, next thy Saviour known) Best, happiest Science Man can reach to know. The Preacher's Merit rate not by thy Ear, His Phrase, his Accent: mean Respect of Taste. Taste is the childish Judgment's hum'rous Pride. To Truth thy Reverence pay, and not its Dress; Esteem him for his Embassy: the Blame Of miss'd Improvement oftnest is our own. Meer Planters are Apollos, and a Paul; Growth is the Spirit's Gift, his virtual Act Alone; his vital, germinating Dew Shed in the Soul; his incremental Beam. Make far, far Progress in Religion's Path: Most at her Entrance stop, Truth's painful Way, Lab'ring with Burden up the steep Ascent: Weaken'd and faint with Sisiphean Toil. Their Works not perfect: like the Babel Pile; Or like the Web of fam'd Penelope, By Night unravel'd, what was wrought by Day. Wishful of settled Rest, be earnest thou, Be arduous, be unwearied. Doubts, Complaints, Rise from our negligent, our carnal Frames. Weak Currents earliest feel the wintry Frost, That never binds their busy, bubbling Springs. Divorce thy Idols, those adult'rous Loves. If Guile hold slend'rest Int'rest in thy Heart Thy Course will slack, and ruffled grow thy Hope. A crossing Bulrush in the limpid Brook Its Stream will check, and fret its even Brow. So the hurl'd Pebble in the silent Pool Spreads a wide Circle to its farthest Shore. Hast thou thy dearest Isaac sacrific'd? Lodg'd in thy Bosom, a Heart-cherish'd Lust, Warm Constitution's spar'd, her darling Sin? All must be sold (get prov'd Sincerity) All, for the Purchase of Heav'n's costly Pearl, Gain of Assurance, Peace, and grounded Joy. Are all converted? suits one general Stile The Saint and Sinner? no just Diff'rence made? This, to the cordial Promises of Life, That, to the Threats of endless Death consign'd? This, safe in Christ? endanger'd Alien that? One, chang'd; approv'd in Works of living Faith? The other, dead in loathsome Nature still? The Saint, how sometimes need his wand'ring Steps The questing Shepherd's kind restoring Care. The Sheep of Christ, shall one be ever lost? In their Lord's Hand eternally secure John x. 28.. Yet these the Gospel Pastor must reclaim. The distant, grossly stray'd, alarm with Fear: Their Danger from th' infernal prouling Wolf, Watchful to spoil them; while compassionate, His Voice shou'd Lamb-like Hearts more softly call; Gently reduct, their strengthless Faintings cheer, And rest them, safely lodg'd, within the Fold. O Israel's Shepherd! How admir'd thy Love! The Cares for thy backsliding Fugitive! How wond'rous! that enlarge thy pitying Heart, Ev'n in the Wilderness Luke xv. 4. In these discouraging Circumstances the Christian may relieve himself from another Passage, exceedingly consolatory, Jer. iii. from 12 to 24 V. thy Flock to leave, Thy whole, dear Flock, to seek one Wand'rer lost! One, poor, lost, single Wand'rer! worthless Charge! Borne in thy tender Arms rejoycing Home. Preacher of in-felt Trials, hear him tell The Sorrows and Supports of tempted Souls. How God upholds 'em, by his secret Hand Mysterious, in the long, foul, loud, Night-storm Of dark Desertion! O! the sure, safe stay, Recumbence on Paternal Deity! Black Hour of Terrors! when th' assaulted Thoughts With Satan conflict, and his firey Darts Christ's trembling Soldier roil, in hell-bred Fray. By suff'ring Patience, by Belief's try'd Shield Best warded, and the might of conq'ring Prayer. Sharp Warfare! to my Faith severely known. Well shall the skilful Teacher bend his Pains The thoughtless Mind to rouze by awes of Death; When Angels minist'ring, or waiting Fiends To order'd Worlds shall parting Souls convey, Uncertain Summons, soon to pass-on All! —To warn of Judgment, strict-accounting-Time For trusted Talents, Life's important Charge. —Of heav'nly Crowns to tell, of penal Chains, Endless Duration. (O Eternity! Thou vast Idea!)—In conceited Hearts Lull'd into stupid Safety, unrenew'd, To humble Nature's fleshly Confidence, Chief bar to Christ.—To shake Formality, False-trusted Rest.—Clear Scripture Marks to show For Man's self-Proof, his safe or dang'rous State. The Privileges of th' adopted Heir, Union with Jesus, Nuptial Fellowship, Assurance, filial Liberty, Access With free, with holy Boldness, near the Throne. Nor less shall it advantage him to learn His needful Cautions, Pride in heav'nly Gifts, Fond worldly Love, Remissness in his Watch, Slips, sure Fore-runners of a shameful Fall. The right Dispenser of the saving Word, Studious of Heaven's high Will the Whole to know, The Whole to teach, himself a living Rule, No Tenet of the Writ inspir'd conceals. By Praise unmov'd, contemning Man's Contempt, (O Fame, best slighted! O exalting Scorn!) He courts no Patron, no loud Censure fears. Tho' the dread Glories of the Father's Name, And his dear Counsels deep, of antient Love: Tho' God the Spirit, his Personality, His Teachings, in-felt Presence, Joys, and Aids (Truths, brightly obvious thro' the Scripture Page, Howe'er disown'd in our Apostate Day:) Tho' Jesu's Natures, Merit, Offices, His mean, and glorious Advent, Cross, and Crown, Tho' these lead most, best lead the sacred Theme; Yet Righteousness, the Christian's Rule of Life, What forms his Temper, sanctifying Truths, Heav'n's Scribe neglects not, Lessons sweet to Saints. (All holy his Elect, belov'd of God Colos. iii. 12..) Doctrine and Practice, Faith and answ'ring Fruits, Inherent Rectitude that fits for Heav'n, How well ye mingle! Works, how well enforc'd By Gospel Motives! Laws of Christ, the King, The Preacher's Task is done.—Employment new Has call'd him, on his ministerial Toil. Ye conscientious Parents, O! be found, Amid th' Assembly congregate and full, Your Infant Race presenting; to receive Appointed Baptism's Initial Rite. Free Members made, by this inducting Sign, Of the Church visible.—Your Lambs repose In the mild Shepherds Arms: see, where he waits! With Pray'rs, and holy Washings mistical His little Vot'ry-Flock to dedicate; A living grateful Sacrifice to God, An Off'ring sweet! on Christ, the Altar, laid That sanctifies the Gift. Heav'n's Sovereign, pleas'd, Affixes now himself the binding Seal To his own faithful Cov'nant; that insures Pardon, Adoption, Grace, regenerate Pow'rs, His Spirit's Energy; here typify'd By the pure sprinkled Element. Christ, giv'n! (Prefigur'd in this sacramental Act, Its Truth and Substance) with his saving Fruits, Suff'rings, and Merits: Blessings how divine! On thee, Believer! and thy holy Seed, All he entails. Ah! how mistook, by those That the blest Laver from their Babes withhold, Who Gospel Converts make less priviledg'd Than legal Circumcision; and deny Their hapless Children free-born Fœderal Rights, That rigid Law to bondag'd Jews allows. Wake now in ev'ry Soul more filial Light, More glad'ning Sentiment! Each humbled Heart Make, fitly, of it's own once-plighted Oath Fresh Recognition! while we joyntly bend The grateful Knee! Faiths solemn Pomp to close. Father of boundless Mercies! this thy Love To helpless Man, and his polluted Race, Thy thankful Church adores! On our young Band Of Brethren, thy new-listed Militants (Who in thy gracious Ord'nance have received Regeneration figurative) O shed That! with thy Gifts in Pledge, there signify'd, In large Effusion! This, our Work fulfill'd Of Charity, by Warrant from thy Word, Kindly accept! as on their Parts, and Ours, Homage, and Praise: with vow'd Obedience due! The gentle Innocents are with their Trains To native Roofs dismiss'd.—But wilt Thou go? Go yet so soon? from thy best Blessings haste? Lo! that rich Table! where the Bread of Life, Spread by All-pitying Goodness, open stands To Wretches, famish'd with Sin-pining Wants: Lost Prodigals, with Favour welcom'd Home, The King himself is enter'd; from his Host Of prostrate Angels that more distant wait, How gracious, see! he moves to mortal Friends! How kindly, hark! to ev'ry Guest he calls! Ah! wherefore wou'dst thou fly? he calls to Thee, Poor trembling Sinner, pale with causeless Fears. To thee heart-humbled Publican, self-deem'd Unfit, unworthiest, welcome therefore most. Stay—thy mild Sov'reign bids thee—taste his Feast, Will'd thee by Love, his dying, dear Command. —But why, intruding Stranger, tarriest Thou? Proud Pharisee, without the Wedding Robe, Censorious, hateful Spy, of Life unclean? Why thou, mask'd Hypocrite? dissembled Friend? With trait'rous Kiss re-acting Judas' Guile. Wretch! Thou? whom Gain of secular Employ Alone has brought, the Banquet to profane? Bold Innovator, unprepar'd and vile! Expect! the Lord of his dishonour'd Board Shall note thee, and pronounce vindictive Doom. The Bread is blest: reach forth thy thankful Hand And take—“Memorial of thy dying Lord.” Not Transubstantiate, Blood, and Flesh, and Bone, Whole, very Christ, Rome's Idol, big with Sin: Nor as Consubstant with the Elements By partial Presence, Luther's dark Deceit: Nor yet as meer Exemplar, dream'd by some Traducive of his Glory: more, be thine, Sacrifical Remembrance, of the Price Our Ransom; paid in Blood for deadliest Guilt. Oh! hide thy shame-spread Face, and turn thy Eyes In mournful Prospect back to Calv'ry now, Back to the Garden, to the dolorous Ground Grief-moisten'd with his Bloood-sweat Agony. Ah! what that Agony?—ah! felt for whom?— Say, Angel Luke xxii. 43.! near him then, that heard, beheld, Thy humbled Maker, agoniz'd thyself) What—but Thou can'st not say!—no Thought can pierce Of Man or Angel that profound of Pains! 'Twas his Soul's Travail, Sorrow's sharpest Throe, 'Twas Love's Delivery of a new-born World. Miraculous! from dead now living born. Fix, Meditation! still, thy Tear-brim'd Eye! From Earth he rises, rise and follow thou Thy Jesu still, (tho' left of ev'ry Friend) To Annas', Herod's, Pilate's guilty Hall, His triple Cavalcade of solemn Scorn. Oh! thro' what Streights of shifting pageant Woes! Slow, linger'd, studied Miseries! matchless all! Stoop'd thou to Suff'rings, patient Son of God! How meek he stands the Charge of venal Tongues! Lamb-like before his cruel Shearers dumb. But ah! behold him now! behold him bound (Tho' faultless own'd) by his unrighteous Judge! Abus'd by Buffetings (by Taunts, that loud His dread Omniscience dare) with Scourges torn; To Injuries, mocking join'd, and rude Contempt, His Sceptre-Reed, and bloody thorny-Crown. Ah still behold! if thou can'st bear the View, See! thy dear Sacrifice, beneath his Cross (Like typeal Isaac) bending with its Weight! Merc'less! all fainting, to the baleful Tree They nail my Jesus!—whelm'd in bitt'rest Woes, And Dereliction! Sport of hellish Jews. —Ah! brand not Jews, our Sins (procuring Cause) Thy Sins, Believer! wrought his Change of Woes, Thy Sins and Mine! these forc'd his sanguine Sweat, Rent him with Stripes, six'd deep the bloody Thorn, Mark'd him with Blows, expos'd his sacred Face To Shame and Spitting; drove the wounding Nails Deep-tort'ring, in his streaming Feet and Hands: Thrust thro' his Spear-pierc'd Heart the murd'ring Steel; And urg'd his Soul to Pains!—to Cries!—to Death? Early to Man the dying Sacrifice His saving Merits reach'd. Ah! why to Man? Why to lost Man? yet not to Angels lost? Angels! Heav'n's noblest First-born! Heirs of Love! Man! vain, vile Prodigal! the younger Son? Why to one Convert-Sufferer, on the Cross? And not his Fellow? why to vilest Jews! Those very Jews who late, with wicked Hands, The Saviour slew? (by Peter's Sermon turn'd At Pentecost) and not to Jewish Priests? Those guilty Rulers? and all Israel's Race? Why, chosen Sinner! Miscreant! why to thee This Grace? and not a whole degenerate World? Unfathomable Thought! Love's Myst'ry all! Still, Mercy waits thee.—Take: “The saving Cup”, To him, of bitt'rest Sorrows, fill'd with Wrath; To thee, of rich Redemption, dearly bought. Blessings assur'd; the Covenant in his Blood Seal'd with the Father. He, to be a God, To thee a God, all-comprehending Tie: Thou, to be his, devoted: happiest Bond! Drink; the sweet Pledge of Union, Sonship, Bliss. O Cordial! felt mysterious in the Soul; Law, dreadful Justice, Conscience, Satan, Guilt, All silenc'd, by one Draught from Jesu's Love! Touch'd, captiv'd, raptur'd, aw'd, all extasy'd! All lost! in trembling Wonder, thy Embrace I meet, thou heavenly Bridegroom The bold, and familiar Metaphors used throughout this Paragraph, tho' differing from the common Idioms of Speech among us, are, the current Language of Scripture, and genuine Sense of it; customary to the Conceptions, and Expressions of devout Minds: and it is hoped, will be admitted, and understood by every Christian.! ah! repeat, My Life! my Sweetness! those connubial Vows (Soft, as when first the Sounds betroth'd my Soul) “Thy Maker is thy Husband” Isaiah liv. 5. I would affectionately recommend to the pious, believing Reader's Perusal, this amazing Passage, down to Verse 11. than which, I think, there is not any one more remarkably, and singularly comforting in the whole sacred Scriptures.. O! repeat Earth, Air, and Skies th' eternal Echoes round, “Thy Maker is thy Husband”!—'tis for Words (Th' o'erwhelming Bliss) too vast! for Thought too full! Ye Nymphs of Solyma, my bridal Friends, That view my shudd'ring Pangs, my speechless Joy, Tell my Soul's Lord, the too too lovely—(ah! By Pity's Softness I adjure ye!) tell My Prince! my Charmer!—I am sick of Love. Turn thy sweet Eyes away! their Beams o'erpower, With Ravishments too soft, my fainting Sight! —Yet hold me near Thee; set me as a Seal, Deep on thy dear dear Heart! for strong as Death Are the fond Ardours of impatient Love; More cruel than the Grave, its Jealousy. —And art thou mine? the dread, dear Lover mine? Th' espousing God?—ah me! a worthless Bride! How base, how poor! bow prostrate Thoughts in Praise, In grateful Thanks: with all thy purest Fires, Flame, kindled Heart: bend Choice, Affections, Will; Be wholly his the Life his Pity sav'd. Go, Christian! with th' endearing Pledges seal'd Fresh on thy Soul, resembling Pattern show How Jesus liv'd; thy lov'd and loving Lord. Go, copy his Humility, his Zeal To glorify his Father, his Contempt Of vain, base Earth; Disciple of his Cross. His Temp'rance copy, Resignation, Truth: His Meekness, Pity, large Benevolence: His godlike Fortitude, firm Constancy: His Love of holy Privacy and Prayer. Go, happy Fav'rite, feed his pining Poor, Silent in patient Want; the friendless Poor, His suff'ring Int'rest (by the selfish World Neglected) Merit little mark'd below. Thy Saviour-Judge, thy love-remember'd Work With echoed Eugé shall applaud, and crown. Shall not this Rite the Charity enlarge. Of Brethren, differing by Dissensions small? Differing, not disunited; Members still Of one, same Body: Branches in one Vine: Christ's Fold, tho' many: all but one, his Spouse. Spirit of Grace! Peace-breathing Paraclete; Thy Children nearer bring, bring nearer yet In love thy Saints. This bridal Supper make Their Eucharist, their Agape: of Joy The Season known, a Feast of heavenly Friends. O Lamb of God! self-humbled, once, to Death On the vile Cross! when? in exalted Pomp, When? to thy whole Elect, shalt thou return With full Salvation? to that Day thy Church Looks from these sad Memorials. Lamb of God! Haste, to be more admir'd by joyful Saints. O Lamb of God. By thy once-offer'd Blood Here represented, offer'd once for all, Perfect thy holy People; keep the Flock, Thy dying Purchase, by thy wakeful Eye And Presence, hourly guarding. Lamb of God! Here often meet them, and record their Vows. The solemn Myst'ries cease.—The Pastor, hear! With awful Mien, and Lips of Grace, has clos'd The parting Benediction.—But is all, All ended?—all?—is now the vacant Time For trifling Visits? for the vain Discourse Of worldly Friends? by nearer Int'rests claim'd, The Calls, domestick, of intrusted Souls. The soft Companion of thy Life's vow'd Hours, Where, where is She? thy other dearer self? Where her lov'd Offspring? Wedlock's sweetest Bonds, Pledges of mutual Faith, of chastest Joys? Invite 'em round thee by a Father's Voice, That Voice of mildest, soft Authority. Examine! teach! exhort them! warn! reprove! Their Instrument of Being, ah! be mov'd, Be rous'd, be arduous for their highest Weal. So the fond Couples of the plumy Race Teach, with joint Pains, their cherish'd Young to fly; Around the little artless Broods they watch, With flutt'ring Hearts; and by Example kind Instruct them, frequent, thro' the treacherous Woods, Where safe to stretch, where slack th' experienc'd Wing. O Education! are thy tend'rest Laws Expell'd the Parent's Heart? where then is Love? Paternal Love, that first of Laws, O where? Where Nature's strongest Instinct felt of all? And hast thou One, within thy menial Charge, One left (by Servitude's inferior Place) O'erlook'd, neglected in thy partial Thought? Subordination meer, of Man to Man. Name of corporeal Difference, not of Souls: Souls have one Essence, one congenial Life, One Dignity, one Worth: in Heav'n's high Kin, Nearest affinited; one Spirit breath'd Their Virtues eminent, immortal, pure, Impress of Deity: one hapless Fall In Guilt enthrall'd 'em, one rich Blood redeem'd. By Dust thy Brethren too, thy Flesh, thy Bone, Parts of thy dread Account, thy awful Trust: Parts of thy common Nature:—shall not these (Careful for thee) excite a grateful Strife? Of due Returns, some generous Heaven-warm'd Zeal? Large, best Returns, a Master's worthiest Care. Ah! drop Distinction now, while call'd to serve One heavenly Master in thy House of Faith. By common Wants, by common Mercies join'd, Join in Petitions too, in mutual Praise. Retire—o'erlabour not Youth's feebler Strength Thy Cares devolve on safe maternal Trust. Thy Task is done. To freer Scenes retire; For lonely Joys, for solitary Sweets, For friendliest Counsels with the mental Pow'r Yet, while deep-wand'ring in the Paths of Thought, If not so well the Chamber's cloyst'ring Walls Thy Health or Temper suit, as open Skies, Or in the Garden, or sequestring Field, (Not where throng'd Numbers range for graceless Mirth) At large thy meditating Walk pursue; Reposing, 'gainst thy Hours of future Want, The treasur'd Word with faithful Memory. So Jesus oft' to Gethsemane's Shades, Or some still Mountain's Heights, alone wirhdrew. Religious Musings may the pious Breast Raise from this Earth, this lower House of God: Heav'n's costly Cabinet, of Wonders full. What ever some, of rigid Sanctity (So misconceiv'd) have taught, to gloom the Mind, Forbidding ev'ry harmless Use of Sense, Corrupting Christ's by Jewish Discipline Now vacated, use wisely thou thy Grant Of Gospel Liberty: all Place is free; God, not the Place considers, but the Heart. Yet, have a Care! thy own frail Weakness know; Know, and be watchful: to th' unguarded Saint, Oft', Solitude proves worst Scoiety. Fear that unseen Observer, than thyself More intimately present, and with him Converse, in sweet ejaculated Prayer. O sweetest Converse! O Grace-strength'ning Pray'r! Best Work in private of the love-born Soul. But if thy Mate, or home-left Family Still, near demand thee; if the sick-pain'd Friend, The Widow, or all helpless Fatherless Thy Visit need, thy lonely Haunts refrain: Seek others Welfare readier than thy own; Most, pure Religion dwells with Charity. In this be like thy Saviour: Pattern fair Of heavenliest Virtues, labouring Good to All. These are the Pleasures, in Religion's Paths (Blest Paths of Safety) to be only found. And will deluded Man, perverse of Heart, Self-cruel, on the World's infested Wilds Risque for vain Toys the Jewel of his Soul? View that tumultuous Road! how thick appear The Sons of sportive Folly! bent on Speed, When Heaven's high Wisdom bids a sacred Rest! Perverting, in that Breach, his kind Decree, Ease to the labour'd Creature; haply some Shall, ere return, his dire Resentments feel, Death-smit (how frequent) by Disaster sore. View those ill-peopled Fields! the thoughtless Throng! All, on unseemly Recreations drawn! What Swarms! of ev'ry Rank, and Sex, and Age! Vagrants from Sion all, God's humbler Throne. Ah! better far a Day, an happy Hour, One heavenly Moment, in thy blissful Courts, Than Ages, lavish'd in their impious Joy. Dread Charge! of precious Seasons vainly spent, Or lost in sensual Indolence at home. Others, the Bands of bolder Riot, view! Sunk in Debauches o'er th' intemperate Glass. Or loud in Feuds, or clamorous Levity; In Oaths, in Revels wasting sacred Time To decent Silence due, and public Peace: Too oft' in dismal Consequences rued; Disease, neglected Families, and Loss Of strict paternal Government, Youth's Bane. Presumptuous Insult on almighty Pow'r! Contemptuous Scorn of sov'reign Will! that Power! Heard in the Thunder, in the Light'ning seen, Felt in the angry Winds.—his Goodness too Lives free diffus'd through wide Creation's Space. And dares weak Man! dependent, subject Man, Affront the Law of God? his Maker's Law? His Governor? his Judge? dares the vile Worm, Reptile of Earth, defy the Lord of Heav'n? O native Britain! Land of Gospel Light! Fav'rite of Heav'n! professing purest Truth! Seat of mild Liberty to Vice abus'd! Justly, dear Parent! do thy virtuous Sons Drop o'er thy Matron-Neck the conscious Tear; Of thy insensate, iron Progeny The griev'd Spectators: vex'd (like upright Lot In Wrath-doom'd Sodom) while our mourning Streets The nightly Lewdness shames, the raging Oaths Of Blasphemy, and Circe's bestial Throng. While Music in the sober Hours of Morn Effeminates our Isle; Waste, Luxury, And Sloth engend'ring; Sloth, worst social Ill! He, who his Sabbath Rest ordain'd, enjoins Thy Six Days Labour: Sloth subverts his Law. Lamented View! while on the devious Stage Lewd Comedy, in loose intriguing Dress (Degenerate from the antient, worthier Scene) Appears, seductive of the Youthful Heart; While (blush to Manners) on the midnight Sleep In Revels, wakes th' infernal Masquerade, Transplanted Vice of modern Italy, Sink of dark Superstition, Sloth and Sin. Shall not, for Guilt like this, long patient Heav'n In Judgments visit?—O'er the slumb'ring Realm Has shook (already felt) its milder Rod. Already War has thinn'd thy numerous Sons, In Death left welt'ring on a foreign Plain. Rebellion, worst domestic Fiend! has rag'd Thy frighted Cities round: and through thy Herds Long wasting Murrain, threat'ning ghastly Want, Has breath'd Contagion; breaths her Threat'ning still. Should Locusts, summoning thy Harvest Fields Their Legions call! (whose Scouts have late been sent To spy thy Coasts) should broad-wing'd Pestilence Her Millions sweep away! Or from beneath Earthquakes their Horrors wake in tenfold Strength! Such, but more fatal as have twice forewarn'd Thy pale Inhabitants, Alarming Thought! How big with Potent! Oh! provok'd at last! Shall not, for Guilt impenitent? for Guilt Accumulate like thine, long-patient Heav'n Rise terribly vindictive? doom-full rise To smite, to waste a vain-professing Land? Ah! pitied Blindness of apostate Man, Made to be only in his Maker blest, Yet can in All, in all Things Pleasure know But his dear Former: willing to be known, His to be known; his Portion, Father, Guide; His present Guardian-Friend, and final Good. O Goodness! all Parental! Father still Of Man thy Creature, Man, though fall'n, not lost; Enoch cou'd walk with thee, and Abraham; Worms With Deity; frail Dust with mighty God. Why may not now frail Dust in Favour walk? Why not vile me? thy Pity's Miracle, Wonder of Guilt, from foulest Life reclaim'd, A willing Vot'ry, though thy feeblest Child? O! let down somewhat of thy heavenly Self In this dark Breast, this Hell-benighted Heart! Parent of Life divine, some vital Beam! In Privacies, my frequent lonely Walk, By Hill, by Field, by Willow-arbour'd Brook, By twilight Paths of Woods with Closet Shade, Alone from ev'ry Eye (yet least alone With thee all present Father, mild of Grace) Thou deign'st me sweet Communion; while I breathe (With Love-uplifted Hands, and Eyes, and Soul) To thy Communion sweet, Returns I breathe In prostrate Thought, and Vows, and murmur'd Prayer. —He whispers to my deepest Solitude, In Pressures of my loneliest, saddest Thought, “Be undismay'd; thy God is present here, Is nigh, is with thee Isaiah xli. 10. compared with xliii. 2.; though through whelming Floods, Thro' Fires, thy Path is mark'd: distress'd, and try'd, The Friend omnipotent, thy guardian Strength Accompanies thy Steps; is with thee still.”— I trust thy Promises, I plead them o'er, I urge them often on my sinking Heart, I drink into their Sweetness deep, and taste Their Ravishments, and feel their Cordial Powers. —Ye Hills! ye Fields! clear, willow-arbour'd Brook! And Woods with twilight Paths of Closet Shade! Lov'd Haunts, that my celestial Solaces Have seen, so oft' have heard my filial Vows, Be Witness to those Interviews divine. Records of favour'd Seasons, fast imprest On grateful Memory: like the votive Stones In Luz, by solitary Jacob rear'd To Padan journeying—These to meditate, Thro' the dark Lab'rinths of my Pilgrimage Shall cheer its sablest Glooms, its heaviest Hours. By Jesus manumis'd from hellish Bonds, A sentenc'd Slave, the ransom'd in his Blood, O dear Emanuel! (God in human Flesh Intabernacled strange) my remnant Days (Few Days, alas! of conscious Evil full) Shall all in Acts of Love be vow'd to thee. Health, Action, Powers, will I be only thine: Soul, Flesh, thy Creature, consecrated all: Thy Servant, only thine, redeeming Lord! By Choice the self devoted to thy Fear. Thus the poor, feathery Captive, hard escap'd With Life th' ensnaring Fowler's deadly Wile, With flutt'ring Bosom hastes, (her timorous Wing Unbating) till of happy Covert sure, Hid in her cloyst'ring Bow'r: there, safe at Rest, The Fear-deliver'd-Wand'rer, sooth'd and calm'd, In her sweet Shelter sits: too warn'd to roam: Then, swells her Note with more exulting Joy. The End of the Second Part. EVENING EMPLOYMENT. PART III. On the subsequent and closing Duties, Recollection, Self-Examination, and the several Offices of Charity. The whole concluding with a Contemplation on the Eternal Sabbath. And a Glimpse of the Saint in Glory. CONTENTS. Invocation to the Blessed Spirit. Evening Worship ended. Enquiry of its Effects on the Heart. The Duties of Charity instanced and enforced; closed with an Encomium of the active Christian. Sun Setting described, Twilight, Night and Stars. Several Conjectures mention'd, with the Folly of such Enquiries; introducing an Episode in the History of an exemplary Noble Penitent. A Moonlight Scene. Retiring to Rest, with the Prayer. A Midnight Contemplation on the Eternal Sabbath. A Vision, in Sleep, of a departed Saint. Discourses with it, on the Nature of the Soul, its Individuation, Præ-existence, and universal Redemption. The Spirits Answers, reproving such Speculation, and exhorting to others more useful: to further which it give a Prospect of Heaven, and selects three Instances for Observation; a glorified Saint released from a State of Poverty; one that had been a notorious Sinner; and a third who died in Despondency. A Complaint on the Vision's ceasing. The Spirit's consolatory Speech, with Rules for a holy Life. On the Question, if Friends know each other in Glory? It discovers itself and departs. Exciting a pathetical Meditation, which ends the Whole. Come holy Visitant, celestial Guide, Spirit divine, of God! (not less thy Self; Essential Deity:) whose strength'ning Hand Thro' the still Wand'rings of my Morning's Walk And holier Duties, in thy House engag'd Homeward my feebly-fainting Steps has brought To my last Period now, of Sabbath Hours. Come, with thy wonted Aids to close my Theme! With thy fresh Breathings on th' instructed Muse, Thy consecrated Gift!—As vital Gales, Thro' the Reeds whisp'ring in the Heat of Day, Sooth in lost Thought the list'ning Traveler's Ear Tir'd with his painful Road, so feel my Pow'rs Thy quick'ning Influence, that e'er while deprest As with some fatal Omen, half resolv'd No more to travel in Parnassian Soil, Tho' sweet; a Map with many a Fairy Spot, Illusively, in pleasing Prospect mark'd, Mocking th' Advent'rer's Search: So shadowy all Has prov'd my Way; a Desart, beat with Storms: Hope, almost out of Sight, that show'd me once My Land of Rest; and naked, wintry Age Threat'ning me near (unshelter'd and ill sped) With Cares, and Wants, her numerous growing Brood, Like the Night Mists my Heel fast gath'ring on. But thy Life-cheering Voice, Omnipotent! Speaker of Comfort strange! allures me forth To one more Labour due; perhaps my last! For Something bodes me so, of sad, within. Unless, late flow'ring in Life's barren Path, Some Sweet unlook'd-for, some autumnal Rose At length I pluck, that Daughter of the Thorn. The Church's Rites, her last Solemnities Are fully ended: Twice in Public paid, Her Claim maternal. What returning Trains Flock from the Sanctuary! a graceful Sight. Some, for Heav'n's Favour, on the Duty done Resting their Christless Hope. Some posting, fast, To Walks, to Company; o'erjoy'd to find Their Task discharg'd, and anxious how to lose The least Impressions, recent on the Heart. But whether hasten'st thou, thy after-Work Of Recollection grateful, to begin? What are thy Frames? has the keen, piercing Word Reach'd Home, and fasten'd in thy Soul; its Mark? When Christ is preaching on the Gospel Mount, At his Descent, the Leper shall be cleans'd. Matth. viii. 1, 2, 3. Trembled thy Conscience when the firey Law Flash'd its red Threat'nings? who? what Angel-Strength? What Fortitude invincible can bear When God is angry?—bow'd thy willing Ear To the mild Tenders of thy Saviour-King? Are thy Hopes rais'd, thy misty Damps all clear'd By the bright Promises, and Unbelief In their warm Sun-shine melted sweetly down? To his State-Rooms of Ordinances brought, Thro' their pure Lattice have I seen my Lord The heavenly Bridegroom, and could mark his Smiles? What Resolutions, for thy Watch, thy Walk Has thy Heart plan'd, led out on Grace for Strength? Thy Breast examine well, thy Gain, thy Loss In this rich heavenly Traffic, and record In Memory's Volume where inclin'd the Scale. Yet are thy Toils not done: reduce thy Light Now into Practice, 'tis th' expected End For which we hear. Our Sabbath has its Work; Love may yet labour, on Care's Day of Rest. Knows thy Friend-pitying Heart no pensive Saint Journeying in Darkness, whom thy Pilgrim Voice (From a large Fund of stor'd Experiences) Gently might cheer? None, grip'd by wordly Straits, Whom thy free giving, or (in Act next kind) Thy lending Hand as lib'ral, or at least Thy pleading Interest, might from deadliest Want Timely redeem? No Mourner, destitute In lonely Widow-hood, Woes most tragic Scene! With her young Brood of helpless Orphans left, Wat'ring with Tears the fond, sad Mother's Knee? Have Alms been added? Alms shou'd follow Pray'rs Their Harbingers, as Sunshine does the Dawn. Will Indigence exempt thee, art thou poor?— And is thy Soul poor too? the meanest Wretch Has somewhat; Pity's godlike Charity. Thou'lt call this Counsel moral, be it so: 'Tis Christian too; built on Belief's sound Base, Its Evidence and Fruits; no Works, no Faith 1 Ep. Colos. iv and vii compared. James ii. 17, 20, 26, Matth. vii. 16, 17, 20.. A formal proud Morality may vaunt Without Religion, but Religion's Self Ne'er had true Life without Morality. Whence was that Peal, that beats on trembling Air Its slow, dead Pulse!—I hear—and yet I hear Its mournful Echoes!—'tis the Passing-Bell. How dolefully it sounds!—there went a Soul! But where?—and art Thou next prepar'd to die? Where is Liberio? late the gay, the vain, 'Till Sickness seiz'd him—hah! that wakes a Blush In conscious Memory. Once thou had'st a Friend, Nisus the lov'd; in his fall'n Nature's State, Guilty, insensible, and unreclaim'd He died: Without one kind Attempt from thee. What hast thou done, thou Loit'rer for thy God! A Life, a Friend, a Soul, perhaps is lost, Lost—and for ever!—can I bear the Thought? Deep let it goad me! may it wring me now! Up! stir! exert thee! double all thy Cares, And taught by past Remisness labour more! Ah! might this Thought alarm the Sons of Sloth That now! here! only on Man's present Stage Heroic Charity can act her Part: Where human Miseries give her, fair, to shine. In Heav'n, no moving Drama will present Fit Scene, her godlike Talent to display. Life's suff'ring Graces too, Repentance, there, Divine Forgiveness, Faith, and patient Hope (View'd in the Step of Majesty below) When from Earth's Theatre dismiss'd, undrest, Their final, their eternal Exit quite Must make; behind the Curtain (dropt) of Time. Well hast thou traffick'd in thy holy Work, Servant of God! with all thy Tasks discharg'd Hast thy full Course in Duty's Circle run Of Sacred, Houshould, Private, and as due, Of Neighbourhood; tho' latest not less dear. Hallowing the Day, thy Master's Jubilee, Hast serv'd, in him, thyself: by heaping more Thy Sum of Talents, lent in Steward Trust, Against thy Audit-Hour of doubled Gain. Matth. xxv. 20. Pray'rs yield thee Bills, mean Time, for present Wants; Prompt-paid from the full Treasury of Heav'n. But see! where now, thy own best Parallel, See where at length the downward-bending Sun His low, broad Orb of setting Splendours rests On the green Pillow of yon Western Steep. In smiling Radiance bidding half our World Farewel, on Speed to visit nether Skies. Carrying Morn, Noon, and Night in ceaseless change Each new, swift Minute round the peopled Ball. Look! how the rapid Journeyer seems to bait His slack'ning Steeds, and loos'd to Evening Sports, Shoots down obliquely his diverging Beams! That kindle on opposing Hills the Blaze Of glitt'ring Turrets, and illumin'd Domes; A Prospect all on Fire: 'till sinking still, More, and still sinking, while to Sight quite lost, His Rays play upward, in the fleecy Clouds That, swiftly pencil'd, dress a mimic Scene In Fancy's Eye, of Groves, and whiten'd Alps, And Towers romantic, rear'd Compleat, or Waste In ruin'd Majesty; with Interspace Of golden Ether, and Elysian Plain. Then vanish quite, as soon; and shift by Turns To Tinctures of a thousand diff'rent Dyes. Till Twilight last steps forth, her modest Face Half hid, beneath her gentler-lucent Vest She, from their flowery Prisons strait unlocks The light-wing'd Odours; that on sweetest Range Drop their rich, nectar'd Treasures as they fly; Catch'd, vagrant, by the sultry-soothing Gale. 'Tis solemn Gloom, toil'd Nature's grateful Hour Of universal Solace; calm, and still. The little Warbler of the cheerful Day The Charmer-Lark, has sung himself to Rest. Each feathery Labourer has his Vesper clos'd Perch'd on his Bough. But wakes, in conscious Man, Wakes still, the deep Solicitude of Thought! And now more deep, while mounted in her Sphere (Prime near Attendant on her Solar Lord) The Star of Eve lights up her Diamond Flames. And the pale milder Regent of the Night, Replenish'd from her Brother's lucid Urn, In her fill'd Orb, new ris'n, compleatly thron'd, Pours thro' wide Fields of Sky her argent Stream. Queen of the Shades, amid her lesser Train Of fix'd and planetary Lustre's joyn'd In Lumination mutual, slow she moves Thro' her throng'd Court; and Heav'n's vast Palace glows With an infinitude of living Fires. At the grand Pomp of Wonders, in what Heart Glows not Devotion too?—“My Sire! my God! All-glorious King! of thy dread Greatness much, Much have I heard, by the awe-shudd'ring Ear. But in this Mirrour, my o'erdazzled Eye Of Sense, surveys thee; more tremendous far! In Dust, my Mother, humbler, humbler—oh! In penitential Ashes, let me view My Self, abhorr'd: my Self! more black, more vile Job. xlii. 5, 6..” —What a big Swarm of bold Inquisitors Burst in, tumultuous, on the Reasoning Pow'r. O'er curious, of the Trembler they enquire If those immensely-distant Globes be Suns, With each his System of revolving Earths; Plac'd inaccessible to human Ken? They question, why those four resplendant Moons (Discernable but thro' the nightly Tube) Are seen to roll round Planetary Jove, And ask for what they roll, for whom they shine? Or, to what Purposes in Saturn, serve His Moons more numerous, and Elliptic Ring? Or, if intended for our Use at all, Why hides, beneath his Sun, th' Hermetic Star The Planet Mercury.? Th' unruly Thoughts, all up, next start a Doubt If Comets be expiring Worlds on Fire? Purg'd in the Solar Furnace (as perchance Our Planet shall in turn) and thence detach'd Each, a new Earth (like that) new Heav'ns to fill See Conjectures by the Reverend Mr. Wall. Memoirs of Literature, Vol. 4. p. 69.? Is Space, they ask, that dolorous Dungeon vast Of Suff'rings final, that Abyss which Fiends So deprecate, as by the Scripture Code Luke viii. 31. May intimated seem? Sad, wand'ring State Of Souls intelligent, down that dead Void Immens'rable, in outer Darkness cast, Exil'd, and shut from all the Worlds of Day! Or (since Effects most cross and opposite From the same Cause can boundless Pow'r produce) What if this very Sun, our now best Gift Shou'd Man's tormenting Prison prove, at last. Destin'd by awful Nemesis divine Guilt's dread Abode, it's local Hell of Fire Enquiry into the Nature and Place of Hell, by the Reverend Mr. Swinden.? To such wild Doubts the mental Wranglers fall: Then to extreams, far wide, they run; and form Conjectures diff'rent, all as dark and strange, That, possibly, it Residence may yield For happiest Beings; the bright Place where John Saw in Apocalypse Rev. xix. 17. the Angel stand. Begone, Seducers of my humbler Heart! I chase ye from my meditating Hour! On the proud Plumes of Science where wou'd soar Th' unsatisfy'd Enquirer? O, 'tis vain, 'Tis daring, 'tis for Man's weak Flight too high, The poor, raw Pupil, in his childish School! Salvation! be thy interesting Theme My whole, blest Study here; and Suns, and Stars, A Kind of trav'ling Speculation, made My Road-Employment, as I pass their Spheres, Led up by Angels, to my Father's Skies. Can I this Hope appropriate, and the Grace Fail to admire, unmerited and free, That calls me to a Dignity so high? The grateful Thought that labours in my Breast Has woke a Theme that, suitably, shall yield My Evening Solitude a sacred Song. A Theme that has (encreasing heavenly Bliss) Been hymn'd by Angels to their golden Lyres. The courtly Wilmot was of noblest Blood; Comely in Person, nor in Mind less grac'd With Genius, native Modesty, and Wit: Humanely affable, and of a Soul Dauntless and brave; in Britain's naval Wars In many a Deed of hardiest Prowess try'd. From Learning's Fount Accomplishment he drew, Where Isis by her younger Athens rolls; Heighten'd, by Travel, with a Knowledge gain'd, Of various Lands, and European Courts. Whence his nerv'd Muse, too rich in Strength and Fires, Learn'd first to mate the antient Latian Vein. Yet, with these choice Endowments, innate Vice, In her foul Poisons, deep had drench'd his Heart. Impious he prov'd, his Life was shameless, leud, He spurn'd his Saviour, he deny'd his God, In Satire rag'd, and revell'd in his Song, Scoff'd at all Warnings, every Check out wore. But Heav'n that in his Book of hid Decrees Had mark'd even this Apostate for his own, Mov'd to Paternal Chastning, bent his Bow: And a keen, deadly Arrow, dipt in Love, Sent thro' his Soul, with wasting Sickness wing'd; That rous'd Reflection from her sensual Swoon. She plac'd Gorgonian Horrours to his view, His Talents squander'd, his enormous Crimes, 'Gainst Nature's, Reason's, and Religion's Light; Who can express the Pang!—'till timely sent By pitying Grace, the good Evangelus, Tender in Labours for distemper'd Souls, A healing Cordial, sweet Conversion brought: Giv'n from the wise Physician's Hand above, That a new Life the hopeless Patient gave. He blest—admir'd—Pray'r loos'd his Guilt-bound Tongue; He wept, he worship'd, search'd God's reverenc'd Word, And in Isaiah's Chap. lii. beginning (as the Connexion ought to be) at 13 v. and continued through the whole liii. Chap. Death-enlightning Page Saw his dear Saviour, bright in Prophecy. Heard, hear'd him speak! with kind inviting Voice As once to Peter Math. xiv. 29. (Faith when Jesus calls It's Foot will venture on the stormiest Wave To reach him in her desperate, drowning Arms.) Felt his Embrace! (his Danger past, and Fears At those kind Accents “wherefore didst thou doubt?”) Then, with a placid Smile, and gushing Eyes, Fix'd on his Lord, a Joy too big for Words! Full of calm Confidence, and Hope, and Peace, He bow'd, ador'd, and on his Breast expir'd. —Now in the blest Society of Saints, With the thron'd Class of pardon'd Penitents, (His Brother Miscreant, who on Calv'ry nail'd Died near his God, and Sister Magdalene Of seven strong Fiends by Jesus dispossess'd) The Victor sings the Lamb's triumphant Song. Leaving his impious Life, his Godly Death A Monument, in ev'ry Age, to stand For guiltiest Sinners, of redeeming Pow'r. Hark!—'tis the Nightingale, Love's lonely Bird, In the deep Bosom of this dusky Wood Pathless of human Foot, she sits recluse, Her Arbour; by the melancholy Scene Sweetning her Note; while the soft Lamp of Night Gleams on the burnish'd Brook with liquid Gold: Cheering the Shade; on whose tall, top-most Boughs, Paled with the glimmering Rays, the ruslling Leaves Join their low Whispers; clos'd with Cadence deep From the drone Beetle's Sleep-exciting Horn. And off the sharp-brow'd Cliff, in Murmurs faint From hence scarce heard, a distant Water-fall Adds it's hoarse, solemn, dying Harmony. All, with Confusion-mix'd, of Music rude, Reverberated, from the cavern'd Hill; The Cell where ever-waking Echo keeps Her still, nocturnal Watch.—'Tis pleasing thus To wander, thoughtful, thro' the sylvan Grove, At fragrant Morn, scorch'd Noon, or dewy Eve; Oft' as her Season free Occasion lends. Slow as the silent Fowler roves, who steps The fresh-plow'd Glebe, and in each Furrow quests Some springing Game—nor ceases this to please The Mind of Nature fond in ev'ry Dress, Ev'n when she wears her Virgin Shroud of Snows, And weeping Mists spread, sad, her Funeral Pall. Each Change affords Delight. But mark! where North Shot from the Pole, a new Aurora breaks With imitated Dawn. Mysterious Light! Perhaps portentous of Earth's hast'ning Doom, Vapour, and sanguine Cloud, and Pillar'd Smoke, As speaks the Seer inspir'd Joel ii. 31.. And now the Moon A Curtain-Fold of richest Drapery draws O'er her dim'd Form, that warns to due Repose. But first, e'er rested on my Bed's kind Down, Him I once more invoke, whose Guardian-Wing Broods o'er me while I walk, and when I rest. “God of my Days and Nights, be gently near “With thy safe Presence still! and Sleep, thy Gift, “Health's dear Physician send, to drop his Balm; “With Dreams devoutly pure, from Dread, or Sin!” —I close my Eyes, but Meditation wakes: My Midnight Pillow's silent Visitor, Long with my Thoughts us'd mutely to converse; Renewing thus her heavenly Monody. Has one seventh Portion more of measur'd Time, Of holiest Time been lent? accomplish'd well, Tho' weak, in Duties painful Husbandry. And wilt thou, senseless! from the Harvest Feast Serv'd by my Hand, a Self-Absenter turn? From this Sabbatic Type, of shadow'd Rest, Climb thy Mind's Scale to it's Reality, Thy Everlasting Sabbath: hop'd and sure. What must it be, of exquisitely blest, That Eye, nor Ear, of pleasant, or of sweet, Nor Pow'rs of human Heart can least conceive! Has God created Earth's mean Spot so fair, A Work not meant for perfect, which his Hand (As the rough out-Lines, a meer Sketch of Pow'r) One Day shall blot, consigning it to Flames? How must he then, so Opulent, and Wise, His lovelier, everlasting World have built! A standing Trophy of Almighty Skill. Where Saints, all congregate in one, shall keep Eternal Sabbatism of Joy and Praise. In his pleas'd Presence, over-full of Bliss! Associate with their mediatorial King! And dear Companions of Angelic Thrones! No Night, discomforting, shall heavy spread Her Raven-Wing, nor Moon shall need suspend Her friendly Lamp; the Pow'r who made the Sun That immaterial, uncreated Light! Himself shall beam the more effulgent Day. O, what a Temple shall I enter then, Myself a Pillar, by the Builder, made; From my blest Station ne'er to be displac'd! To view this Mortal in Immortal shrin'd! Corruption, chang'd for Incorruptible! This Life of Sin, for Life Immaculate! The triple League of Satan, World, and Flesh, Spoil'd, routed, broke—Temptation! ended all! And last Repentance, flying in their Rear!— No more with Sickness, Care, and Penury, Sharp Disappointments, Insults, Slights and Wrongs Myself to mourn, or share another's Pang! From Fears of Life at rest, and Fears of Death; My Works of Imperfection, Toil and Pain!— What Transports shall it give, to feel my Tears Wip'd all, for ever, from these Eyes away By God's own blissful Hand Rev. vii. 17., his Face to see; In Fatherly Relentings, reconcil'd, Rejoycing o'er me!—and be seated near My lovely Jesus, while with longing Soul I hear, of matchless Love, his suff'ring Tale! Hear! with a holy Gratitude, that needs (With a strange Kind of pitying Sympathy) My trembling Spirit must half-mourning leave: Sad, in the Bosom of so many Joys. Which his sweet Converse shall as soon appease; Fill'd, from his Presence, with Beatitude Ineffable, as from a living Stream Pour'd; plenteous as my finite can sustain. No longer, there, my Solace-keeping Heart Shall of Estrangement, Frowns, and Absences, Rebellious Hardness, or dull frozen Damp, Darkness, or Wandrings, ever more, lament. Perfection issues, from our Union full, In ev'ry Pow'r, and Faculty, matur'd: My Knowledge shall be perfected, and Will, And Holiness, grown up a Nature there; And perfected Affections, all at height; Love burning clear, and full, Meridian Joy!— Strange Bliss! too wonderful for Mind or Tongue To comprehend (mysterious) or express. Completed, and, at once, Progressive too! Loving, still more to love! and without Bound, Rising to rise! and knowing, but to know! Beginning, as we end! and running thro' Myriads of Æras, only to begin1 O, what a Centre, indivisible, In one vast Circle, is Eternity! O, what an Ocean deep is Infinite! Impossible to fathom, or exhaust. What Corruscations, felt, of Deity (Too brightly glorious for a Mortal's Strength) Break on my sinking Dust! Thought can sustain, And Utterance reach no more—My God! my God!— —So fine a Clue cou'd Contemplation's Hand No longer touch; for my o'erlabour'd Pow'rs A feathery Slumber now laid gently down, And with her Wand, in Poppy Odours dip'd, A Spell upon my visual Orbs let fall, That ev'ry Portal of the Senses clos'd. Like his enchanting Rod, as Fables tell, Whose potent Touch cou'd Sight, oblivious, seal. But on my mental Eye a Vision stole, That plac'd before its View a shining Form. White were its Robes, and gracefully beneath A starry Circlet play'd its flowing Hair: That, from its Rings, ambrosial Fragrance wav'd Whom lowly Greeting, and with prostate Look Of Salutation reverent, as befits Celestial Guest, I thus in brief address'd. O! sent on kindest Errand, for no less Than heavenly I must deem thee, what to Earth This Seat of Worms has brought thee, and to me Least worthy of such Grace?—When smiling meek, As in familiar Use of Friend with Friend, Thus answ'ring, interpos'd the Radiance mild. Offspring of Dust, my Origin like thine, Tho' now prefer'd so high; for of thy Race I once was mortal, till releas'd from Flesh, Me, to this Rank, redeeming Goodness rais'd. I come in kind Commission, nothing loath, Thy Couch to tend with gentlest Ministry. My freest Converse offering; if of thee I ought may win, imparted, and impart To thee, in Change, my Mind's Experience all, (All what I may) as fits thy State to know. Friendliest of Spirits etherial (rapt I cry'd) Wondrous is sure thy Goodness! that can yield A Moment of extatic Bliss to lose From that bright World, where much I long to dwell! Near that dear Lord, whom more I long to see! Gentlest thy Condescension, that can deign To visit me, poor Cottager in Clay! Invited to so strange Communion free: That now I haste, advent'rous, to begin. But what for Theme?—If freely (as thou sayst) Much could I of the human Soul enquire That Mystery to herself; if yet it holds Specific Differences of Sex in Heav'n? See the Rabbinical Writers: and Spicilegium Patrum, said to be written by the Patriarch Enoch, and published in Greek by Dr. Grabe, to which many of the Fathers, and St. Jude is thought to refer. Tho' these first Ends of Nature there shall cease, May not the manly Spirit, bold, robust, Conversing with its Sister-Essence pure, Delection heighten from that soft Alloy? And, contrary, the gentler Virtue, mild, Taste happier Solace by her Male Compeer? As Lights in Paintings more set off the Shades; Or as in Music's meliorated Tones, The finer Strings chime sweetliest to the Base.— Might I not ask, if, after Death, this Soul Lives individuate? See Baxter's Works. or, as Love of Self (Tho' needful here to Preservation's Ends) Works much her Infelicity below, In that strong Passion grown inordinate: May not her ceasing from this Self-Enthral, These individuating Affections, Cares, And Labours, perfect her Delights above? Conglobing with the universal Soul; As Bucket-Drops themselves in Ocean lose, By Union of one common Element. Haply, to better Self again restor'd When Resurrection shall fit Body yield. These, would it not mislike thee, could I point As Subject for Discourse sublime and high. And thence interrogate when first arose This intellectual Spark of Entity? Created daily, by a recent Act In each fresh Embrio? when Almighty Pow'r Is said from his creating Work to rest; Or all at once, in one coëval Birth Of Spirits, in some pre-existent State? See Glanvil's Lux Orientalis, and Dr. H. More's Works. From whence laps'd differently, ethereal first, And next aërial stationed, she at last Is drop'd, to act in weak terrestrial Life. Probationer for her first, Birth-right Skies? As Brachman, Magi, and Gymnosophist, (Indian, and Persian, and Egyptian Sage,) The whole World's Learning; and the Attick Schools Of Plato and Pythagoras, antient Jew, And later Christian, all for Truth have taught? How justly stays not here to grant or null. What Questions might not, more, this Theme suggest Dared I recount them, for thy Art to solve. As whether Threatnings of eternal Dole, Hell's Woe, in Strictness, shall for ever last? To which my Thoughts, as safest led, incline. Or whether God, since infinite in Good (With Reverence, diffident, I speak) his Ire On Beings, reprobate denounc'd, and lost, (Angels and Mankind, after Ages past) May not remit? his Justice so content; And that redeeming Price, sufficient paid For all (more free his Grace to magnify) In Season due accept? that by his Son (Whether in Heav'n or Earth) all Things again He to their pristine Stations shall restore, Of Amity and Bliss; once found so dear. So, in himself, regath'ring into one All Beings, harmoniz'd in Union sweet? Whence Sin and Death, no Creatures caus'd of God, Shall be for evermore annihilate Made frustrate, and all Enemies be slain?— But far be from my Thought (tho' pleasing sure And honouring, as I deem my Maker's Grace) Far be from me to say that this, or ought Prelectur'd here, I dare for Creed adopt! Where Scriptures Silence chuse in all, or most. Pond'rings, that oft', unwittingly, at Times Deep Cogitation conflicts in her Walks. At best, but what has seem'd (nor less, nor more) Than specious, and propounded, meer, as Doubt. —And rather wou'd I, tho' so wide disgress'd, This favour'd Season of Instruction use On mete, important Queries; how I more, How better, most acceptably might serve Him, whom deserv'dly lov'd, supremely prais'd, Serve, love, and praise both we, and all the Blest. To which, with Look that more than half betray'd Disapprobation, join'd with mild Reproof, Th' ethereal Guest, in Accents as of one Long waiting patient, gave in meek Reply. I blame not thy Enquiry, 'tis the means Sure Truth on safe-establish'd Ground to learn. If venturing on too hazardous a Sea, Thy Bark thou risque not, with thy Compass lost. Man's Wisdom is to know his proper Truth, Not what best lists, but what concerns him most; All is, beyond, but Folly, or worse Pride: Fruit of that Tree, twice pluck'd, by which he fell. But whether social Bands of happiest Souls Distinction need of Gender, as on Earth, Imports not thee, o'er curious to enquire. Enough, if thou attain but this for sure, Perfect they live, and perfect Best implies, Which e'er that be, in differing Sex, or none. Nor shall it serve thy smallest Good, if told In what strange Way unbodied Mind subsists: Remaining Individuate (best to think) Or in one universal Flux convolv'd. Labyrinth where much vain Thought has wilder'd run. Or the Soul's Birth wou'dst thou interrogate, Whether immediate, or long Ages past? The same it, either Way for thee shall prove, A mournful Truth, since laps'd indeed—how sure Thyself can feel! small Comfort when, or where. One Protoplast, with all his hapless Sons! Fall'n thou canst find thou art, and need'st no more; Save means of thy Recov'ry how to know. Rest center'd there, on Revelation's Point Not wand'ring tread dark Circles of the Schools: Which would but more perplex thee, not instruct, Much less content: wish'd End in all Research. Truth to expect, and hold implicit Creeds By popular Opinions, and high Names, What falser? who, than the meer Man profound Of Learning, the deep scienc'd, carnal Scribe Christ's Church, in ev'ry Age, has troubled more? Not the least Grief of her try'd, present Day. But fly Dispute, distemp'ring long the World, If threaten'd Torment shall for ever last? To which thy Thought, affirmative, inclines. Safest for Man such Thought, and wisest too, Where Passions need their strongest Curb of Fear. The other dangerous, and too like profane: Seeking of God's sharp Threat to sheath the Sting; And by bland Artifice, and soft-spun Phrase, A Theft of Compliment, wou'd steal away Justice that Gem essential of his Crown. Feigning it Honour to his Nature done That Grace should universally redeem. First minted in that pre-existent Forge Of Plato, and the Crew of Cabolists. (Specious I grant to purblind Reason fair) Squar'd well to suit their Fable of the Soul, Thro' her feign'd tripartite Progressions laps'd; And many Lapses must have many Cures. Thus God, as Just, must cease; for God, as Good? Bold Mutilation of the Deity! That (worse than Babel Insolence) would build God's Goodness on the Ruins of his Truth. Accounting Nought is Good but what is Kind; Not measuring it by Wisdom's Line: and what Is Justice Self, but Goodness, modify'd? And Punishment is Good where Sin is Ill, Shou'd that ev'n endless be, while this exists. Faith is a Sceptic in Philosophy; Prudent, suspicious, modest, slow, and cool; And when smooth Speculation pleads its Vote, And Scripture Silence keeps, sits silent too. Leave the sole Judge his Laws Interpreter, Dark (for this Purpose) oft' to Man reveal'd: Ablest his own high Cause of Attributes To vindicate, and clear from foul Asperse. Whether all Beings he shall save at last, (Dear to be wish'd!) or leave them where they fell, Fruit of self Choice, in unremitting Woe. I paus'd for Answer, with the Influence aw'd Of reasoning so divine; when pleasing Speech, Not clos'd, the gentle Monitor resum'd. Well hast thou urg'd, and grateful to my Ear Thy Purpose, rather to investigate Truths useful, not entangling and abstruse; Wisdom's best Choice the Culture of the Heart. Sublime of Christian Science, and Result Of hard-earn'd Knowledge, Searches, Costs, and Aims. Heat gath'ring in with Light: and what so fit The Heart to warm as Heav'n, in nearest View? Which I, Occasion wish'd of minist'ring, Wait to impart; for such I have in Pow'r. And the bright Mansions of that blissful World (Some few faint Glimpses shadowing to thy Eye) Will point thee, in Imagination's Glass: Made pure, and plac'd the Objects best to show. Scarce were the Accents ended, e'er my Soul (Loos'd, or in this Corporeal, hard to tell) Felt Transportation wonderful, like His (The Gentiles great Apostle fitly stiled) To the third Heav'n up-caught, or like, what once Ezekiel Chap. viii. 3, knew, whom sudden by the Hair, The Angel (in the Visions, high, of God) From far Assyria's Land, a spacious Tract, Bore thro' the Firmament; and in the Courts Of antient Salem's Temple sat him down. Such, and much stranger my Transition seem'd: Brought to a Temple more magnificent, With glist'ring Pavements, and transplendent Domes. Before whose adamantine Portals, large, A Troop of lovely Graces waiting sat In comely Order; oft' dismiss'd to Earth On high Employment, by the Sovereign King. Faith in the radiant Circle first appear'd: A royal Stole her princely Shoulders spread Impurpled deep in Blood; and in one Hand A Book she held, inscrib'd The Word of God:” The other fastly clasp'd a Cross, on which, Immoveable, she fix'd her earnest Eye. Close by her Side sat Hope her Sister-Twin: Lent on an Anchor her enfolded Arms, With Aspect turn'd inquisitive, to gaze Within the Vail. Next, lowly at her Feet, Sat Patience, smiling, in an Anchorite's Weed. And Love was there, below call'd Charity, Wing-footed, as they tell of Maia's Son: Matchless in Speed, the Nuncio of the Skies: Holding his kindled Torch, in saffron Vest Array'd; with Wings expanded as for Flight, That when they wav'd shone, pure, like lambent Fires. And last was Truth's fair Championess nam'd Zeal; Clad, as old Poets of Bellona feign, In Mail; with Helm and Launce, and martial Scarf All o'er inwrought with Tongues, and flaming Hearts: She sat with Dove-ey'd Meekness Hand in Hand; Of Cherub Countenance, and Child-like Form, Who wore, beneath her Breasts, a Virgin Zone. Whereon, “The Law of Kindness,” fair was wrote In Gems, and golden Letters bright emboss'd. We pass the sacred Entrance and arrive Soon at the Centre of th' empyreal Fane. Where Myriads of celestial Dignities, In Numbers that all Number wide surpass'd, Before my Sight their shining Forms display'd. And Incense from their golden Censers fum'd Of richest Odour! nor was wanting Song, To Symphonies attun'd of dulcet Harps, By fullest Chorus clos'd—Part, Him ador'd, In Anthems loud extol; who once their Tribes Redeem'd, by precious Off'ring of his Blood, From ev'ry peopled Nation, Tongue and Clime: Made, of Earth's Aliens, Kings and Priests to God. Worthiest, by dread Atchievements, to receive Trophies of Glory, Blessing, Wealth, and Pow'r. Part, chaunt, in Airs responsive to the Lay, Blessing and Honour, Glory, Pow'r, to Him Eternal, on the universal Throne, Be ever giv'n, and to th' exalted Lamb! Then, in rais'd Voices bursts the general Quire. Amen! they shout, and farthest Heav'n resounds With Hallelujah; past what Heart e'er felt Melodious, yet in strong, sonorous Force The Stound of rushing Torrents not unlike, Or Thunders when they croud their deepning Peals. At Charm so aweful! so o'erpow'ring sweet! All mortal Sense, expiring must have sunk In the dread Blandishment; had not my Pow'rs (Bliss-overwhelm'd) immediate Rescue found From Voice, as of some heavenly Speaker nigh: New Wonder thus suggesting to my Ear. Turn dear fraternal Pilgrim while I point Thy Eye, attently fix'd, to these few Scenes. In my weigh'd Choice, officious for thy Good Selected: that peculiar Will to thee Significant appear, if ponder'd well. See'st thou that Spirit of superior Port High in meek Majesty, that near the Throne (Clouded with Light too dazzling for thy Eye) Bears in his graceful Hand the Victor Palm? Ah! wou'd'st thou think that ever (while on Earth) So chief a Favourite should be rank'd so mean! Affliction's heaviest Rod he once sustain'd! Sickness besieged the harrass'd Wariour long. Love's Suff'rings, for a numerous Infant Brood He felt; Humanity's most bleeding Pang! Obscurely wretched, with no helping Friend, The Vulture Care fed daily on his Heart, Chain'd to the Rock of Wave-vex'd Poverty. Yet unrepining Life's worst Lot he bore. To teach thee, how Humility must wait E're her blest Hand, releas'd, can reach the Crown. Faith's Triumphs are from Combat not by Rest. When Grace some signal Hero means to train, Storms sweep the blooming Roses from his Path. She bids Affliction sound the Trump of War, Leads him to thorny Difficulty's Field, And throws before each Step a stumbling Cross. Gold must its Trial thro' the Furnace pass; And stand, for Proof, the Touchstone and the Scale. See'st thou that other choice illustrious Form, In Vestments glistring bright? like Mountain-Snows, When their broad Sheets spread, opening, to the Sun. How chang'd, from what in Nature's Filth he wore! So foul! one Spot of Vice throughout he seem'd. Sensual, profane—the Monster had his Step Just set in Hell; 'till Conscience rung alarm, Conscience, let loose: the Hurricane of Fiends! He flies to Duty to appease the Storm; Toils in vain Washings, Penance, Fasts, and Prayers, And gains a Self-wrought Righteousness, misdeem'd By blind Legality, the Wedding Robe. For, not from Life he works. Now plum'd he stands On his own boasted Strength, a sandy Base. Anon Temptation arms: he fights—and falls. Down drop his Resolutions, Courage, Peace, All his proud Armour spoil'd. In many a Fray Stir'd, by rash Confidence, new Fight to wage He ventures desperate, and is vanquish'd still. Where is he now? in his first State or worse! Despondence, with his Giant Foot, insults O'er his prone Captive, weak (by Proof) confest. When Faith a strong Deliverer points him near, The pitying Jesus; Him, with trembling Hand He importuning holds, and, on his Touch, A purer Righteousness, an abler Might, A different Life and Nature seels infus'd. On his bruis'd Heart the melting Saviour pours (That good Samaritan) his precious Oyl, From his own Wounds, the sov'reign bleeding Balm. —Thus Grace has giv'n true Strength, but gives not Pow'r Completely to fulfill strict, rigorous Law, That no Abatement grants. Law binds to Death; This, too, he sees discharg'd.—O what a Peace, A Friend how all-sufficient has he found! With Sin, the curst Canaanite on watch, Disturbing still the Camp (a Foe block'd up, But yet within the Fort) in shameful Soils In mourn'd Defeats, to the dear Blood he hastes Of daily Sprinkling.—His redeeming King Fights all his hardy Battles, covers safe His Head from Dangers, in his Hand sustains His Saint when slipping, and when fall'n restores. A Victor prov'd the vanquish'd; fought his way, Led by his glorious Chief, thro' all the Pow'rs Of Guilt and Hell, where now he wears the Crown. Yon raptur'd Saint beholdst thou? just arriv'd From thy far World; whence, ev'ry changing Hour, The Convoy-Hosts with some new Charge return. How blest an Alteration has he found, From what his gloomy Fears were wont to form! Dim were his Views, his Raptures few below. Darkness had seiz'd him, tho' a Child of Light. Dismay'd thro' his whole Pilgrimage he walk'd; In deep Complaints, in holy Sadnesses, And died on the black Confines of Despair. Such Horror may the sav'd Believer know: The lax Backslider, or the strict in Watch, Who (on his Tears, or Duties, stay'd for Peace) His Comforts from himself perversely seeks; And lives not on his Saviour, but his Frames. Comforts are sweet, a choice wish'd Privilege, But not Essentials that insure our Crown; Which oft' wise Love it's dearest Saint denies. We count bright Days and Calms must follow Pray'r, Forgetting that in Scripture stands enroll'd A mourning Heman, and a tempted Job. A leading Moses must, himself, on Earth Fruition be deny'd of that good Land: But once, short-favour'd with the transient Sight. When Doubt o'ershades thee with dejecting Thought Call to remembrance Him, before thy Eye: How false his Apprehensions! which he tells (Hark! thou may'st hear him!) to the list'ning Throng. If e'er a Blush can stain thy Cheek in Heav'n, 'Twill be at Memory of base Unbelief. I heard no more—I listen'd close, and long— But all was hush'd!—I gaz'd, but all was Blank! Nought spoke; or to my Ear, or in my Eye! Ah me! 'twas o'er—each Prospect chang'd and fled! Like what (not seldom) on a Winter's Morn The Trav'ler spies, when the Night-Vapour frore Has with a feathery, mimic Foliage drest The whiten'd Groves, and ev'ry Bush and Spray; That leave, with the first Blast, a naked Scene. No wonder mine so prov'd; for from the Top Of Speculation's Mount, with swift Descent, Back in the Views again of joyless Earth, Th' Intelligent had brought me; which, perceiv'd, Hy Heart in heaviest Disappointment left. As when a Hill, deceptive of the Eye Seems close at Hand (some hollow Way between O'ergaz'd by Sight) at the Plain's farthest End, Where the Path seem'd to touch, the Trav'ller brought Sees a wide Valley left him yet to pass, So paus'd I sad a while; then broke abrupt, Shook with such Paralitic as, 'tis thought, Fix'd sometime on th' entrans'd Apostle's Speech Trembling Impediment; the Thorn (perhaps) Felt in his Flesh 2 Cor. xii. 7.. Ah! how shall e'er, I cry'd, (With faint, with stammering Voice) how ever more This Exile Bondage of terrestrial bear! Happier to not have seen, than leave for Pangs Of-deadliest Absence this celestial Clime! To tread again below the darksome Vale, From that pure Land of Light; and combat new Corruptions, Miseries, Sickness, Fears, and Death! Me! miserably blest!—to taste afresh Infectious Poisons from Pollution's Cup, Sweeten'd with Flatteries by the Traitor Heart, And tire Repentance with my tardy Cure! To feel Temptation's Spring, Lust's Summer-Heats, And Grace's Winter, in my Soul's dead Year! And find my Sun withdraw, and long, dread Night Hang o'er my North—a Borderer on the Pole.— But I must bear it!—Up to those dear Hills My Soul on the safe Dove-like Wings shall climb Of Hope and Love, and ost look out for Dawn. Nor always look in vain, wish'd Light shall rise, Death shall my Morn of vernal Equinox, And better, my eternal Day restore. I droop'd not long for Answer (such as hears Some Mourner from his soft condoling Friend) But, quick, the sympathising Form reply'd. Think not that, now, so distant from his Bliss The Christian lives; a neutral State he holds, His Flesh in Service here, his Heart in Heav'n. Use, not contemn, thy Lot of present Life: Best for thee (Yet) be grateful, and content. Nor, by a Zeal, o'erstrain'd, of Sanctity, Reject what Good, to cheer Thee, Heav'n bestows: Not for thy Portion, but thy Solace meant. Taste as Refreshment—they as much abuse The Giver's Kindness, who quite slight the Gift; Which speaks their close Suspicions, and upbraids His Blessings as but Baits to hide a Snare. There is, of Life, a sinful Weariness, An Avarice for the Hire without the Work; A meer gross, carnal, forc'd Severity, That by it's sullen, peevish, moap'd Deport Seems from it's Pleasures with a Grudge to part, And loves to rust, in Sloth's feign'd-saintly Cowl. Man's Post is in the World, and not his Cell, Dissembling Hardiness by Coward Flight. Safe in Enjoyments, while o'ervaluing none Keep thy strait Course, in Sunshine, Wave and Storm. As well thro' Sea as dangerous Wilderness, O'er many a Shole, rough Gulph, and lurking Sand Thy Passage lies; like him of Ithaca Long Homeward wand'ring after ten Years War. Learn by his Wisdom; stop thy deafen'd Ear To Beauties Syrens, fly from Circe's Shore. But above all keep wide thy sailing Bark, From two dire Rocks, Security and Pride. Fatal as those twin-Monsters, said of old To haunt for Prey the fear'd Sicilian Deep. Look not for lasting Calms, but while they last Improve them, and for changing Skies provide; From Wreck ne'er safe 'till haven'd in thy Port. Nor trust thy Vessel with too swoln a Sail! In thy best Duties, in thy holiest Walk, Despise not others, nor thyself exalt. By thy good Pilot steer, Humility! And thrust proud Thought, that Dæmon, from the Helm. Thus, launch'd on Ocean, or thro' Desart led, Live Faith's laborious Life: each cautious Step Take, closely, by thy Rule the written Word, Read by the Spitit's inward-shining Beari. When Way-laid and assaulted, ne'er in Thought Stand reasoning with Corruption; 'tis a Snare Will catch thy Feet; thy Safety lies in Flight, With Eyes glanc'd up in Pray'r-ejaculate. Weapon, that will be found, of wond'rous Proof! Walk in the Pilgrim-Spirit; round thy Loins See thy Vest girt succinct, thy kindled Lamp High-lifted in thy Hand, and on thy Staff Of Promise stay'd, hold cheerful on thy Way. Nor cheerish least Distrust that him thou lov'st Will e'er disclaim thee; but thy Work sincere, Wrought with much Weakness, will thro' Grace accept, And thy prais'd, final Perseverance crown. I shall thy safe Arrival, in the Train Of Pilgrim-Friends, with gladest welcome hail, And all the Blest—'till when, my Hour fulfill'd In Charge assign'd me, I must up return;— I will not say to leave thee, but to wait When thou shalt follow; whom my Love, not small, With tend'rest Benediction bids farewel. Lost for more Words, I cou'd but just exclaim Might I presume, O too prepar'd to part! One short, blest Space, one little Minute more, Might I, by Grant, obtain thy Steps to stay, This, only, farther should I wish to learn. (Have learnt in Part by what I late have seen) Since Memory is in Heav'n, or how should Man But by comparing what he was, what is, Past, deadly Danger scap'd, with present Bliss, His Obligations to his Saviour know, Do Friends, long parted? in that happier State Do Friends, yet dearer by Relations Bond— Speak, for I see thee hast'ning—It withdrew! No Voice rejoining!—yet, at parting left A Look, celestial sweet, that more than Voice Spoke pleasing'st Assentation in my Ear. When anxious yet to snatch a last, wish'd Glance, Struck Memory back recoil'd! I turn'd, and knew The gaz'd lov'd Form! the dear Sophronia's Shade! Nor more had Speech to call, nor Sense to gaze. But, all o'erpow'r'd with tenderest Extasy, Thus, to myself, in silent Thoughts convers'd. Adieu! for ever dear! for ever blest Adieu!—ah! when shall that sad Word of Woe Be utter'd, from my Grief-taught Heart, no more!— 'Tis She, that whispers Patience to my Dream, Calms my long midnight Watches, and inspires Devotion, in my Eve-spent Solitudes. Too rapturous Consolation here to tell!— Oh! be thy self my Pattern! thy blest Lore My Study! how like Bliss, Parental Saint! I may attain.—On this, a Text divine, Let my Life preach! my Sanctity! my Faith! My active Zeal! my warm, laborious Love! What thy own Comment has explain'd so well. And when, as now, on my last Bed of Pains My Mortal shall be mould'ring, laid to waste, (Fit to be held to Expectations view, When Time is wint'ring on my Head with Grey) When at the Limits of my final Stage, The Pilgrim just at Home, with nought but Death, That intercepting Jordan, in my Way; Instant, its gulphy Waves about to pass. Be then my Eve all hush'd as Summer-Calms! Clear without Vapour, let my Sun go down, A setting Brightness! 'till on Canaan's Shore My Feet shall rest; Emanuel's promis'd Land. There his pleas'd Face admitted to behold, With better Wreath than fading Laurel-Crown Rewarded, and presenting loftier Strain Before my King!—Not with the Pharisee In Self-exulting Boast, “I thank thee God!” Not with the Prodigal, tho' Penitent In Rags of Righteousness. May I appear (From the lov'd Bridegroom's own rich Wardrobe clad) In Righteousness, not mine, but purer far Wrought by himself, compleat: no less my own By imputative Merit; that safe Rock For dying Hope her Bark to anchor sure In the Night-Wreck; when ev'ry Shelf beside Will prove a treacherous Quick-Sand of Despair. So, from some Dream the timorous Infant woke, That finds itself alone, with Darkness round, For Succour lifts its little helpless Hands: Unable how to tell its sad Distress. —Soon as the Parent's pitying Voice it hears, It stops its Moan; Sleep stills its trembling Heart, Dropt, gently, in its careful Guardian's Arms. THE END.</field>
