      <field name="fulltext">ADVENT HYMN. The dawn approaches! golden streaks Brighten e'en now the kindling sky! The long-expected morning breaks! The nuptials of the King draw nigh! Soon will the saints with startled ear, That sweet and longed-for sentence hear, “Behold the Bridegroom cometh!” He comes to claim His purchased Bride, No spot her beauty fair shall dim; He shall in her be glorified, She shall be all complete in Him; O happy saints! rejoice, rejoice! Soon shall sound forth the welcome voice, “Behold the Bridegroom cometh!” Now trim your lamps—prepare your dress— Turn to yon blushing eastern sky! Let this one thought your minds possess, “Am I prepared to meet His eye?” Still watching, waiting be ye found, That ye, with joy may hail the sound, “Behold the Bridegroom cometh!” My soul! look well to thine attire; Hast thou thy wedding garment on? Is it thy one supreme desire The Bridegroom's face to look upon? Soon will the bridal pomp draw nigh, Bright winged precursors soon will cry, “Behold the Bridegroom cometh!” Watch then, and keep thy garments white, Thy glorious destiny survey; Let earthly objects fade from sight, Think only of that blissful day When Christ shall come His Bride to claim, While voices numberless proclaim “Behold the Bridegroom cometh!” MIDNIGHT. Why should my anxious thoughts explore So oft, that undiscovered shore, From whence the soul returns no more? Why should I try to pierce the gloom, That shrouds the solemn, silent tomb, That narrow house, man's long, long home? Inscrutable to mortal eye Is death's appalling mystery— Then why to solve it vainly try? When on our hemisphere opaque, Night's soothing balm all else partake, Sad thoughts of death my slumbers break. I take a realizing view Of that dread scene I must pass through, While fear's cold damps my brows bedew. Yet fear avails not to delay, Even for one short, fleeting day, The penalty this flesh must pay. My days, weeks, months, and years succeed With such intense, yet noiseless speed, Soon they must reach the term decreed. Oh why thus dread to pass the gate That opens on the eternal state, If heaven's pure joys my soul await? If faith were stronger, love more warm, I should not shudder at the worm Which soon will feed on this poor form. I should not on the anguish dwell Which, ere dissolved, this frame must feel, But long to bid the world farewell. And hail the hour when death for me, Shall set the burdened spirit free; Free to return, oh God, to Thee! Oh when the spirits' path I tread, And learn the secrets of the dead, May light around my steps be shed! Deign Thou, my Saviour, to be near, My parting soul to guide and cheer— Then death itself will wake no fear. [Thou for whom we look, now aid me] “Blessed is he whom the Lord, when He cometh, shall find watching.” Thou for whom we look, now aid me Still to watch, and trim my light! Thou in white robes hast arrayed me, I must watch to keep them white; Cold without, rough winds are blowing, And within the air falls damp; Still amid the darkness glowing, Bright must shine my bridal lamp. Thy free grace, Thy love unbounded, Chose, and bade me waiting stand, Till the glad call should be sounded, “Lo! the Bridegroom is at hand!” Though the time seems long and dreary, And the watch is hard to keep, Still, though faint and weak and weary, Lord! permit me not to sleep. Let me watch for Thine appearing, Till the bridal pomp I hail; Till, night's mists and shadows clearing, Streaming o'er the illumined vale I discern the rising splendour, Catch from far their sweet acclaim, Whose unnumbered voices render Praise and glory to Thy name! Then, to swell the grand procession, May we haste without a fear! While, enriched by our accession, Sweeter anthems greet Thine ear. Then may my white robe be stainless— May my lamp shed light around! E'en without a spot and blameless, May I at that hour be found! Then the Bride, indeed “made ready,” Shall be brought with joy untold; Now no more defiled or needy, But in raiment of wrought gold. For this hour the whole creation Groaned and travailed, as in birth— Now the glorious consummation Fills with joy new heavens and earth. THOUGHTS TO COMFORT. I need no other plea With which to approach to God, Than His own mercy, boundless, free, Through Christ on man bestowed; A Father's love, a Father's care, Receives and answers every prayer. I need no human ear, In which to pour my prayer; My Great High Priest is ever near, On Him I cast my care; To Him, Him only, I confess, Who can alone absolve and bless. I need no works by me Wrought with laborious care, To form a meritorious plea Why I heaven's bliss should share. Christ's finished work, through boundless grace, Has there secured my dwelling-place. I need no prayers to saints, Beads, relics, martyrs' shrines; Hardships 'neath which the spirit faints, Yet still, sore burdened, pines; Christ's service yields my soul delight, Easy His yoke, His burden light. I need no other book To guide my steps to heaven, Than that on which I daily look, By God's own Spirit given; And this, when He illumes our eyes, “Unto Salvation makes us wise.” I need no holy oil To anoint my lips in death; No priestly power my guilt to assoil, And aid my parting breath; Long since those words bade fear to cease, “Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.” I need no priestly mass, No purgatorial fires, My soul t' anneal, my guilt to efface, When this brief life expires; Christ died my eternal life to win, His blood has cleansed me from all sin. I need no other dress, I urge no other claim, Than His unspotted righteousness; In Him complete I am; Heaven's portals at that word fly wide, No passport do I need beside. [Warrior! the foe is stirring and a-field] “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”— 1 Peter v., 8. Warrior! the foe is stirring and a-field, While thou art slumbering, he is broad awake; Thou who art pledged to conquer, not to yield, Shouldst, ere the dawn, thy calm precautions take, And reconnoitre all the hostile lines; A battle must be fought this very day: O choose thy vantage ground—thwart his designs, Prepare to meet his terrible array! His eye is fixed on each unguarded spot; There, at thy weakest point, he aims his force; He plans thy ruin, plans and wearies not, To wiles and stratagems will have recourse. Is this a time for slumber or for sleep? Is this a time for sloth's enticements bland? Now, when thou'rt called unceasing watch to keep, And wait the onset, standing sword in hand. Christian! thy life is but a brief campaign; Though hardships, conflicts, perils must be shared, Fear not to meet them—transient is the pain, The victory certain—the reward prepared. A DEATH-BED SOLILOQUY. Still, still the foe undaunted Pursues me to the grave! Can medicine's power, so vaunted, Do nothing more to save? Pour gold from out my coffers! Bring famed Physicians near! Care not how large your offers! Can life be bought too dear? I see that stormy ocean Its crested billows toss: Alas! more rough the motion Of those I soon must cross! That dark path must be travelled, Though dreaded and unknown! That mystery be unravelled, I shunned to think upon! My sun of life is setting! Its day so bright and fair Was wasted in forgetting The one thing worth my care! The sound of heavenly treasures Fell coldly on my ear: My hopes and schemes and pleasures, All, all were centred here! Will those bright mansions greet me, Now longed for all too late? Will sounds of welcome meet me? O what will be my fate? Will heavenly mercy pardon A life of vanity? And grant the immortal guerdon Nor sought, nor prized by me? Now scenes long past recalling, Some I remember well, Who thought death not appalling— Nay, on the theme would dwell, As if all fear had vanished; And speak of worlds to come, E'en as a child long banished Speaks of his father's home. From life's gay scenes retiring, Neglected and unknown, No earthly joys desiring, They lived for God alone: He, when they die, will own them, Though here “enthusiasts” deemed; Would I had better known them! Their lives a problem seemed. Could love of friends avail me, Some respite I might gain! Alas! sight, hearing fail me! Thoughts, only thoughts remain! Death's icy hand is on me! The unknown world draws nigh! Have mercy, Lord, upon me, Though without hope I die! PRAYER TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. Spirit of truth, of power, of love, Who mak'st the contrite heart Thy seat, The Father's promise from above, Blest Paraclete! The gift by Christ sent down from heaven To cheer His flock, then tempest-tossed, The abundant compensation given For Him they lost; Spirit! the Church's Comforter, With whom Thou deignest to abide, Light, strength, and teaching to confer, Our steps to guide: Spirit of Jesus! one with Him, And with the eternal Father one! Remove the veil that renders dim That glorious Sun. O manifest Thy power anew! Reveal His love, His truths divine! Till in Thy light those truths we view, In vain they shine. “Spirit of glory and of Christ!” Now lead us at His feet to fall; Shew us His ransom has sufficed; Make Him our all! THE PILGRIM'S HYMN. I am a passing stranger here, A traveller hastening on, Through scenes which quickly disappear; E'en while I gaze, they're gone. This gay and busy world would strive My footsteps to detain; But every pleasure she can give Is transient, hurtful, vain. Oh! there's a different world above, On which I fix my eye; A world of happiness and love, Of truth and purity. Admitted there I fain would be, Thither my steps I turn; E'en now, far off, its light I see, Its glories I discern. E'en now I almost seem to hear The voice of many a saint, Once loved on earth, rejoicing there In bliss no words can paint. And thus with one accord they cry, “O, linger not below! Turn from that world thine heart and eye, If thou our bliss wouldst know!” Then once again, vain world, to thee I bid a long farewell; Thou hast no ties, no charms for me, To tempt me here to dwell. Saviour! the Lord of worlds above; King of the land I seek; Support me by Thy strengthening love, Though fearful, faint, and weak. Prepare me for that blissful home, Where all Thy children meet; Then, not the terrors of the tomb Shall keep me from Thy feet. [I saw one in a pilgrim's vest] “Come with us, and we will do thee good.” I saw one in a pilgrim's vest Who travelled like a man in haste. I marked a cross upon his breast, As quickly on his way he pass'd. I followed; for his noble mien Charmed, while it rivetted my eye: His look was open and serene, Meekness attemper'd dignity. There was a power in that calm look, A serious yet attractive grace, That made me long, before he spoke, Its hidden mental cause to trace. I asked him whither he was bound. He said, “The Holy Land I seek!” Methought he loved the very sound, Its name so sweetly did he speak! I asked, “Could he delay awhile, If I to join him should prepare?” “Oh, no!” he said, with winning smile, “To-day, at once, my journey share!” “I cannot tarry;—even now I count the hours till I arrive: My swiftest progress seems too slow, Too small the utmost pains I give!” And then he so described that land, Its beauties, treasures, and delights, Urged me to join his little band, E'en as a loving friend invites; And while he spoke, such truth there seem'd In all he told and dwelt upon; And from his eye such sweetness beam'd, And in his face such gladness shone,— That soon I gave my full consent, Nor e'er repented it was given; And found (as on our way we went) This was a Christian, seeking heaven. [My Saviour! the Lord of all might!] “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee.” Isaiah xliii., 2. My Saviour! the Lord of all might! When I cross the dark river of death, Let not its deep swellings affright! Place Thy merciful arms underneath. Though nature shrink back in dismay, Let faith in strong exercise be! And calmly those waters survey, As the chariot to bear me to Thee. When the long dreaded passage I ford, My Saviour! oh, lift up my head! And whisper that strengthening word, “My blood for thy ransom was shed!” If the enemy then should assail, No evil, no foe, will I fear; Thou hast prayed that my faith may not fail, Thou hast promised Thyself to be near. THOUGHTS OF A DYING FRIEND. Should I weep because the Spirit And the Bride are saying, “Come!” Weep, because through Jesus' merit, Now thy Father calls thee home? Weep when angels' harps and voices Are attuned to welcome thee? Nay, when Christ Himself rejoices, Thou wilt now His glory see. Shall I weep because each feature Thy Redeemer's likeness bears? And a new and glorious creature, He, for His own Heaven, prepares? Weep, to see that frame dissolving Now with mortal suffering worn, And that latest sun revolving Which shall see thee weep or mourn? Shall I weep because thy weeping And thy sighing now will cease? Soon in Christ thou wilt be sleeping; Thou wilt enter into peace. No, each selfish thought repressing, Praise shall now my language be; That free boundless mercy blessing, Which, thus soon, is sheltering thee. A SONG IN THE NIGHT. “Looking unto Jesus.”—Heb. xii., 2. Jesus, my Saviour! look on me, For I am weary and opprest; I come to cast my soul on Thee; Thou art my rest. Look down on me, for I am weak; I feel the toilsome journey's length; Thine aid omnipotent I seek; Thou art my strength. I am bewildered on my way; Dark and tempestuous is the night; O shed Thou fourth some cheeing ray! Thou art my light. Why feel I desolate and lone? Thy praises should my thoughts employ; Thy presence can pour gladness down; Thou art my joy. When the accuser flings his darts I look to Thee—my terrors cease— Thy Cross a hiding-place imparts: Thou art my peace. Vain is all human help for me, I dare not trust an earthly prop; My sole reliance is on Thee; Thou art my hope. Full many a conflict must be fought, But shall I perish, shall I yield? Is that bright motto given for nought, “Thou art my shield”? Standing alone on Jordan's brink In that tremendous, latest strife, Thou wilt not suffer me to sink; Thou art my life. Thou wilt my every want supply E'en to the end, what'er befall; Through life, in death, eternally, Thou art my all. [For me, my God, for me] “Who loved me and gave Himself for me.”—Gal. ii., 20. For me, my God, for me Thy precious blood was shed; For me, my God, for me Thy spotless body bled; For me that flesh with nails was torn, For me that unknown anguish borne. For me, my God, for me, Before Thy throne above, That blood now pleads with Thee— What plea so strong could prove? That costly blood on Calvary spilt Cancels, annihilates my guilt. For me, my God, for me, Though in myself all sin, That precious blood from Thee Pardon, yea love, can win; Through it accepted, cleansed, forgiven, For me opes wide the gate of heaven. For me, my God, for me, In my expiring hour, That blood, my panoply, Each fear shall overpower: My last, my dying words shall be, “That precious blood was shed for me.” [I look to Thee! I hope in Thee!] “My soul followeth hard after Thee.”—Ps. lxxiii., 8. I look to Thee! I hope in Thee! I glory in Thy name! I make Thy righteousness my plea, Thou all-atoning Lamb! Methinks e'en death will welcome be, That I, through death, may pass to Thee. Though now but “darkly, through a glass,” Thy beauty I behold, E'en the faint image I can trace Fills me with joy untold; May I but catch one glimpse of Thee, None, none beside I ask to see. “Thou art my portion,” saith my soul, My all in earth or heaven; None but Thyself can make me whole, No name but Thine is given At which the gates of pearl fly wide— The passport of the justified. I know Thy voice—I strive to keep Thy word within my heart; Tho' the most worthless of Thy sheep, Still Thou my Shepherd art; Firm as a rock that word shall stand, None, none shall pluck me from Thy hand. “Without repentance are Thy gifts;” This thought my hope sustains; In deep distress my soul uplifts, When sin the victory gains; My faith, though weak, shall never fail; Thy prayer shall e'en for me prevail. When I Thy glory shall behold, And see Thee face to face, Sheltered in Thy celestial fold, “A sinner saved by grace,” What will it be Thy love to adore, Assured I shall “go out no more”? [There is a fountain deep and pure] “In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David for sin and for uncleanness.”—Zech. xiii., 1. There is a fountain deep and pure Forth from the riven rock it flows; A healing spring and lasting cure For all terrestrial ills and woes. Thither, each morning, leave I crave To take my feeble sin-sick soul; She emerges from that cleansing wave Unspotted, vigorous, glad, made whole. When faint with noon-day toil and heat, For comfort thither I repair; Around it all is calm and sweet, Rest and refreshment greet me there. And when the shadowy veil of night Across the dewy earth is spread, And the pale moonbeam's silvery light Soft o'er the silent stream is shed; Oh then, in that serenest hour, My purest, holiest joys are given; Sin, sorrow, Satan, lose their power, Around me breathe the airs of heaven. That Holy One, Who deigned to heal One sufferer by Bethesda's pool, There, while beside the fount I kneel, Himself draws near and makes me whole. Thrice blessed fountain! when I reach The source from whence thy waters flow, Then shall I praise, in fitter speech, That love to which such joys I owe. HYMN FOR A SICK CHILD. Saviour! when in pain and anguish, On my bed I pine and languish; When my fevered brow is aching, Sleep my tearful eyes forsaking; Full of tossings through the night, Longing for the morning light:— Thou who in Thy mercy showest That our feeble frame Thou knowest, In Thy patient love uphold me, Closer to Thy bosom fold me— As the suffering babe is prest To its mourning mother's breast. In Thy child's affliction sharing, Pitying, and in love forbearing; Every restless movement stilling, With Thy peace my spirit filling; In my sickness make my bed, And support my weary head. Keep Thy little child from fretting, Bygone hours of health regretting; When my step was light and bounding, When my joyous laugh was sounding; When I sported, hand in hand, With my merry playmate band. Let me, in my pain and sorrow, Comfort from Thy story borrow; Mindful of Thy meek enduring, Life in death for us procuring; Shrinking from Thy bitterest cup, Yet resigned to drink it up. While kind friends, my pillow smoothing, Whisper to me words of soothing, Teach me to endure Thy dealing, And to wait Thy hour of healing; While my medicined cup I take Thankfully, for Thy dear sake. Quietly and unrepining To Thy hands myself resigning, Let me know and feel Thee near me, With Thy rod and staff to cheer me; This unfailing comfort mine, Living, dying, I am Thine. A CHRISTMAS HYMN. Calm was the hallowed night! Valley and mountain height Slumbered in shade; Roofed by heaven's azure fair, Making their flocks their care, Shepherds, in open air, Tranquilly stay'd. Suddenly round them shone, Dazzling to look upon, Splendours of light; Then drew an angel near, And, to allay their fear, Poured on their ravished ear Words of delight! Ne'er, since the world began, Music so sweet to man Sounded abroad; On that auspicious morn, Changing our state forlorn, Christ as a babe was born, Jesus the Lord! Well might the tidings told Waken your harps of gold, Choir unseen! Sweet rang your minstrelsy, “Glory to God on high!” “Peace on earth,” amnesty, “Good will towards men!” Well might the shepherds haste, Ere yet the night was past, That thing to see; Where light the meteor shed Well might the Magi tread, Joyful, the path that led, Saviour, to Thee! Infant of Bethlehem! Now do I seek, like them, Thy mean abode; There in Thy strange disguise Thee do I recognize, Maker of earth and skies, Almighty God! Mysteries so deep deter Nature's proud reasoner, Scorning God's word: Thee, whom the Father seals, He to Thy seed reveals; Each to this mandate kneels,— “Thus saith the Lord.” Wonderful Counsellor! Thee whom the Virgin bore, Thee I receive; God e'er the world began, Perfect God, perfect man, (Mystery too deep to scan) This I believe. Lo, at Thy feet I lay, Giving myself away, All that is mine; Treasures I none unfold, Frankincense, myrrh, or gold, One sinful heart behold, Take it for Thine. Father! Thy love I bless, Who in our deep distress Gavest Thy Son! Saviour! I Thee adore, Spirit! Thine unction pour; Thee I praise evermore, Great Three in One! LINES TO A FELLOW TRAVELLER. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee, because he trusteth in Thee.” What is our sweetest joy? Beloved companion! say; What our delightful, best, employ, Untiring, free from all alloy, In this dark cloudy day? To speak together of our home, Looking for Him who soon will come. Where do our spirits find Refreshment and repose? When heart to heart, and mind to mind, We search those records God designed To medicine all our woes; And feel, as bright its pages shine, Each line was traced by love divine. We look on all around As soon to disappear; We listen to the tempest's sound, As wildly now it sweeps around, Without an anxious fear; We hear a voice amidst its swell Which whispers—“All will soon be well.” Yes, soon the Lord will come; Then will all troubles cease; Earth's kingdoms will His own become; Proud antichrist will meet his doom, All will be joy and peace: These very storms prepare His way, And usher in that glorious day. [What is the lesson I am taught] “Lord, what will Thou have me to do?”—Acts ix., 6. What is the lesson I am taught Daily and hourly, Friend Divine? O could I learn it as I ought! To have no will but Thine. Oft I feel eager to fulfil Some right intent, as best I may; Then comes the mandate “to be still,” To work not, but obey. I meekly plead, “Life's little hour For me, far spent, will soon expire;” My Lord replies, “Thou wilt have power When thou shalt come up higher.” In others, in myself, I see Evils I long at once to cure; Then comes this gentle check to me; “Be patient, and endure.” I think, if this, or that were changed, I could do better, and do more; But is not every step arranged By Thee, whom I adore? That wisdom which can never fail, That love whose depths can ne'er be scanned, E'en in its most minute detail, My daily life has planned. Then let me, with implicit faith, In Thee confide, on Thee depend, And say, “Choose Thou my hourly path, E'en to the end.” [Why are we not afraid of sin] “The sting of death is sin.”—1 Cor. xv., 56. Why are we not afraid of sin, Whether it tempt without, within? Why shrink we not from its approach, Abhorring its defiling touch? Sin makes the Christian's hands hang down; Draws on his soul Jehovah's frown; Unnerves those secret energies, Which else, in fervent prayer would rise. Sin, as a darkening mist, conceals Those glories Christ to faith reveals; Blights the fair garden of the soul When it admits its vapour foul. Malignant spirits watch around, Intent to seize each vantage ground, To rob the Christian of his shield, And lead him to some sin to yield. Full well they ply each artful scheme To make that sin a trifle seem; And, when achieved their cruel aim, Mock at his deep remorse and shame. Sin, the dark source of deep distress, Fills his whole heart with bitterness; Damps, if not breaks his harp's sweet strings, And clogs with deadliest weight his wings. Sin forms an ambush, whence the foe, When death's rough billows o'er us flow, Will aim with skill his poisoned dart To pierce the Christian's fainting heart. Saviour, when I to sin would yield, Let Calvary's Cross to faith revealed, With all its dreadful scenes appear, And fill my soul with shame and fear! HALLOWED SLEEP. Oh, what a tranquil, hallowed sleep Is theirs, whom Christ doth safely keep! Whose dust His angels guard! Oh, what a waking will be theirs, When all the glories He prepares Shall be their bright reward. They will awake in beauty clad, In immortality arrayed; Strength that can ne'er decay; Awake to such a life of bliss As, in a troubled world like this, Fancy can scarce pourtray. Awake to be for ever freed From all those barriers that impede Our growth and progress here; Freed from that heaviest weight of all, Sin's taint, transmitted from the fall, Its power no more to fear. But more, far more, they will awake Their Saviour's likeness to partake, His presence to adore; His voice to hear, His smile to meet, His praise unwearied to repeat, When time shall be no more. Who then shall fear to fall asleep, Who for those happy spirits weep Who now in Christ are blest? Ah, rather let us long and pray, And haste towards that blessed day, When we shall share their rest. LINES ON THE FIRST DAY OF A BIRTHDAY MONTH. As the new moons of old were given A sacred offering to heaven, Enjoined by laws divine, So, Lord, as each new month is lent, Its primal day would I present, Time's first-fruits, at Thy shrine. And chiefly, while I dwell on earth, Should this, the month which gave me birth, Be given to Thee, my God; Oh deign to bless each hour's employ, And fill with peace, and hope, and joy, This heart, Thy mean abode. Let me pursue my heavenly way With growing strength, from day to day, Advancing more and more; And on the day my life commenced May showers of blessings be dispensed, Where drops were given before! Let me be Thine, and Thine alone; Make every faculty Thine own, My Saviour and my King! Each bounteous gift by Thee bestowed, Laid on Thine altar, O my God! To Thee shall glory bring. [O Thou! who didst for me descend] “There is none other name given among men whereby we must be saved.” O Thou! who didst for me descend Into the dark and noisome grave, My God! my everlasting Friend! Mighty indeed art Thou to save! Thou'rt now alive for evermore, And hast the keys of hell and death; Thou art invested with all power In heaven above—on earth beneath. And on Thy vesture shines a name, (Faith can distinctly read the words) Which none beside Thyself may claim, The “King of Kings and Lord of Lords.” But though Thy glory is so great, Thy power so vast—Thy name so high, The sinner in his lowest state To Thee may breathe his contrite sigh. Nay, such is Thine unbounded grace, These for Thy brethren Thou wilt own; And in Thy glorious dwelling-place Seat them beside Thee on Thy throne. ON MEETING CHRISTIAN FRIENDS. I feel not now as once I felt Towards those who love the Saviour's name; His grace the selfish heart can melt, And mine no longer is the same. I used to feel reserved, and shun Even with them sweet intercourse! But now I feel we all are one, And heart-felt love its way will force. I cannot coldly greet or love Those dear by such a sacred tie; With whom I hope to form above One blest united family. Their sorrows, conflicts, joys, are mine, The same our friends, the same our foes; On the same glorious truths divine Our hearts and hopes alike repose. I picture them adorned e'en now With those white robes they soon will wear! And trace already on their brow The Lamb's bright seal engraven there. And when I mark the mournful trace Of sorrow, sickness, or decay, I think how soon from each loved face His hand will wipe all tears away. Meanwhile 'tis sweet, while here we roam, Some foretaste of that love to know, With which, in their celestial home, Each spirit, perfected, will glow. 'Tis sweet to cast constraint aside, To love as brethren; and to shed A brightening gleam o'er life's dark tide, While, hand in hand, its shore we tread. “By this we know that we have passed From death to life,” when thus we love; Our Saviour's words, almost His last, Thus bade us our adoption prove. Oh, then, if some excuse I need For love too soon, too warmly shown, This my apology must plead, 'Tis felt to Christian friends alone. [There are pleasant scenes, there are beauteous spots] “Those that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.”—Heb. xi., 14. There are pleasant scenes, there are beauteous spots Which refresh me while here on the earth I stay; But a lovelier region is still in my thoughts, And oft I repeat, “I am going away.” For I look on each scene, while amidst them I dwell, As one who is quickly to bid them farewell. There are harrowing griefs; there are fearful crimes; There are threatenings of changes from day to day; We seem to have come to the “perilous times;” But still, I repeat, “I am going away.” “I am going where sorrow and crime are unknown;” No change can disturb the immutable throne. There are wearisome hours, this feeble frame Reminds me full oft, it must soon decay; “Must return to the dust from whence it came;” But I smile, and repeat, “I am going away.” “I am going where weakness and langour are o'er;” “No inhabitant there can be sick any more.” There are conflicts of spirit, the strife within Is my heaviest trouble—renewed each day; It will cease but with life—this war with sin,— This thought still sustains—“I am going away.” “I go where this war in my members shall cease,” Where all will be purity, gladness, and peace. PSALM IV. 6. There are some spots of beauty rare, Some scenes so exquisitely fair, Enriched with all the eye admires, Adorned with all the taste desires; Linked with undying themes of yore And redolent with classic lore; Scenes, where the soft and genial clime, Gales scented with Hymethus' thyme, And loveliest landscapes opening wide, The traveller charm on every side— At the first glance his thought would be, “Here, here to dwell, were luxury!” But oh, Thou Giver of all good! Whose hand those costly gifts bestowed, Arrayed this earth in beauty bright, And formed each scene that charms the sight, Could they, could ought apart from Thee, Confer on man felicity? Fill the deep void within his heart? Or more than transient bliss impart? Ah, no; without Thy smile, Thy love, How vain, how powerless would they prove! Amid those splendid works of art, Full oft has sighed a broken heart; And minds that sought but found no rest, Have dwelt, 'mid those fair scenes unblest! Did Thine Apostle deem them fair, Who knew that Thou wert “the unknown” there? What are the forms that charm the eye, In painting, sculpture, scenery;— The sounds that fascinate the ear— The gorgeous halls, the festal cheer— Compared with those delights divine, Unknown, unfelt by all but Thine? Something seems wanted, yet untried, The eye with seeing, unsatisfied— But when, in some far humbler spot, Thy blessing, Saviour! crowns the lot, Where time moves on with noiseless course, Beneath Thy love's constraining force, While with an eye to heaven upraised, Thy works are seen, Thy bounties praised— Earth proves the antepast of heaven For those to whom such joys are given; Who know far greater are in store, When here they shall be seen no more. Yes, with Thy peace, Thy smile, Thy love, E'en earth a paradise may prove. ISAIAH LV. 1. Fountain of living waters! now I come Faint and athirst, freely to take of Thee; I may be yet far distant from my home, And life's long journey seems too much for me; But one refreshing draught from Thee gives strength, E'en to the feeblest, for the journey's length. Never, oh never, let me turn aside To seek refreshment from terrestrial springs; Each well, each “broken cistern,” I have tried, Shall now be numbered with forgotten things; Thy pure translucent streams, and those alone, Shall quench my thirst, and nerve me to go on. O bright and glorious fountain! while I gaze On Thy pure waters, gushing freely forth, And feel the health one heavenly draught conveys, All things beside appear of little worth. Henceforth my prayer, my one desire shall be, In life, in death, to be refreshed by Thee. [“My home, my home, my happy home!”] “I go to prepare a place for you.” “My home, my home, my happy home!” Yes! there is music in the words— And the sweet sound, while here I roam, Thrills my rapt spirit's deepest chords:— Thither, full oft, I lift my eye,— My happy home, for thee I sigh! “My home, my home, my happy home!” Can I the phrase too oft repeat? 'Midst scenes which sin has tinged with gloom, Traversed in pain, with weary feet! Oh no, to heaven I lift my eye, My home, my happy home! I cry. “My home, my home, my happy home!” How many loved ones, there at rest, Wait for the blissful hour to come, When the desires which fill my breast, All, all shall consummated be, My home, my happy home, in thee! “My home, my home, my happy home!” Dwells He not there whom most I love? My country lies beyond the tomb; My heart is given to one above: Oh death, I even long, through thee, My home, my happy home to see. “THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE.” I cannot wander far astray, For Thou, my Saviour, art “the way;” I know no perfect way beside, I know but one unerring guide. My soul, while this blest path I tread, By no false lights will be misled; Thy doctrines satisfy the heart— My God, “the truth” itself Thou art. That heart Thou deignest now to share, Thou'rt formed “the hope of glory” there; Soon I shall quit this world of strife, And feel in death Thou art “the life.” [Bread of Life! do Thou sustain me] “Lord, evermore give us this bread.” Bread of Life! do Thou sustain me, While I journey through the wild; Nor much longer here detain me, Soon take home Thy weary child. But till then, when sinks my heart, Bread of Life! new strength impart. Bread of Life! Thy heavenly flavour Makes distasteful meaner foe; Earth's poor dainties lose their savour; Nought, compared with Thee seems good: Bread of Life! my spirit feed; Nothing more I ask or need. Bread of Life! for Thee I languish; If Thou feed me not I die; E'en amidst expiring anguish This shall be my latest cry: Bread of Life to me be given Now to feast on Thee in heaven. HEBREWS XIII. 5. Promise of truth immutable, Whose preciousness no tongue can tell, Let me repeat and weigh thee well— “Never will I forsake thee.” Hast Thou, the God of earth and heaven, To me, a worm, Thy promise given; My soul from Thee shall ne'er be riven— Never wilt Thou forsake me! Then come what will, while here I stray, Let gloom or sunshine mark my way, This is enough by night, by day,— “Never will I forsake thee.” O, none save He who shed His blood To bring back ruined man to God, Could such a promise have bestowed,— “Never will I forsake thee.” What words of boundless grace and love, Designed all sorrow to remove; Say to me, Saviour, from above, “Never will I forsake thee.” Was ever melody so sweet? Was ever promise so complete? Mercy and truth together meet: Never wilt Thou forsake me. When tossing on life's troublous sea, The swelling waves rage fearfully, Still let these words my anchor be— “Never will I forsake thee.” When conscience wakes with fearful power, And Satan fiery darts would shower, Be this sure word my sheltering tower— “Never will I forsake thee.” Never, though I may turn from Thee, Vile, profitless, ungrateful be, Still wilt Thou, Lord, thus speak to me— “Never will I forsake thee.” Lord, it is like Thee thus to speak— No more I ask, no more I seek— Thy covenant sure Thou wilt not break— Never wilt Thou forsake me. HYMN FOR THE TWILIGHT HOUR. The twilight hour is come, The hour for musings sweet; For breathings towards a heavenly home, For calling back the thoughts that roam, Which earth's low trifles cheat: Oh! may the Holy Spirit's power Hallow and bless the twilight hour! The day is past and gone! The sun has run his round! All nature's course has hastened on; Earth, sea, and sky their task have done, Faithful has each been found. How has my soul pursued her track? Have I gone forward, or gone back? My God! throughout this day, Thine eye has watched my heart! Has marked each footstep of my way; And now its penetrating ray Seems through my soul to dart; Discovering the dark depths within, And many an unsuspected sin. What progress can I trace? What growth in faith and love? What urgent cries for quickening grace? What strenuous toil to run the race? What grasp of things above? Ah! lukewarm praises, languid prayers, Betray a heart oppressed with cares. My loins have not been girt, My lamp has not shone bright; My soul, unwatchful, weak, inert, Has failed such efforts to exert, As draw down life and light; No spur to others has been given, No fragrance shed that breathes of heaven. O Thou, whose cleansing blood Forms my sole hope and plea, Down to that renovating flood, Where guilt is lost and strength renewed, With contrite faith I flee; Now let its healing, quickening power Stamp value on this twilight hour. [As a pilgrim and a stranger] “Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?”—Matt. viii., 26. As a pilgrim and a stranger, Let me, Lord, pursue my way; This dark world is full of danger, Nothing tempts me here to stay: Things the brightest and most fair Tend to hinder and ensnare. Bounteously art Thou supplying Day by day my every want; Nothing really good denying, Still for better things I pant: Train my spirit—draw my heart, Make me ready to depart. Lord, my journey has extended Far towards its appointed length; Evening shadows have descended O'er my path, oft fails my strength; Yet how dimly I discern That bright home for which I yearn. Make that precious organ clearer, Through which I that home behold; Bring heaven's beauties brighter, nearer Its unrivalled charms unfold. Lord, on earth I seek no home, As a pilgrim here I roam. Pleasant is my earthly dwelling, Filled with comfort, peace, content; Still I view it with this feeling, 'Tis a passing pilgrim's tent. Homeward, Lord, I long to flee, Strike my tent, and come to Thee. What deters me? what alarms me? Why the great transition fear? Earth at best nor suits nor charms me, Nothing satisfies me here. Yet, at times, from death I shrink; Dread to touch deep Jordan's brink. Saviour! if my faith were stronger, On Thy word more firmly fixed, Nature would shrink back no longer, But with hope and joy unmixed, Would aspire that home to see, Bought with Thine own blood for me. Why should unbelief thus blind me? All that harms and grieves me here, Then for ever left behind me, Would awake nor sigh nor tear; Death would drown them in his flood, And unite me to my God. HEBREWS XI., 16. Oh yes! there is a land of light! One where the Sun no more goes down; Wherein there shall be no more night, Where darkening skies no more shall frown; And when this earth so dark appears, Onward I look, and dry my tears. Oh, yes, there is a land of peace! No jarring sound can there intrude; There discord and contention cease; Those crystal walls all strife exclude; And when earth's tumults pain my ear, I smile and say “That land draws near.” Oh, yes, there is a land of life! Where glorious forms around the throne No longer fear the dying strife— Suffering and death are there unknown. When here death's ravages I see, Oh! how I long away to flee! Oh, yes, there is a land of love, Where mind with mind, and heart with heart, Such sympathy, such oneness prove, As this low state can ne'er impart. And when for love like this I yearn, Thither my longing eyes I turn. Oh, land of light, peace, life, and love, Sweet is the thought that I, ere long, Shall to thy blissful scenes remove, And shine thy glorious forms among. Saviour! I look to that bright home, And wait and long to see Thee come. [My soul, thou art weary within me and faint] “In due season we shall reap if we faint not.” My soul, thou art weary within me and faint; I hear thee thus breathing thy mournful complaint, “O, when will this harassing warfare be o'er? O, when will mine enemy foil me no more?” My soul, be not weary—shrink not from the strife; Redouble thine efforts—it is for thy life; That soldier alone wears the conqueror's wreath Who has proved himself faithful—yea even to death. The result is not doubtful, the victory is sure, But only for those to the end who endure; And legions invisible, near thee arrayed, Are watching intently to cheer and to aid. Nay, more, fainting spirit, look upward and see Thy Captain omnipotent watching o'er thee; Giving charge to His angels to keep thee from harm, Stretching forth for thy succour His sheltering arm. Look, look unto Him! to the faint He gives power, Appeal to His love in this suffering hour; He will look on thee now, as on Gideon of old, And infuse by that look strength and courage untold. Be not weary and faint, though the warfare with sin Must still be continued, without and within; Be sober, be vigilant, watch to the end, On the sure word of promise unfaltering depend. Yes! look unto Jesus and yield not to fear, The time of the end is, for thee, very near; That Saviour who chose thee and made thee His own, The feeblest He loves will with victory crown. [As life's illusions fade away] “Now abideth faith, hope, charity.”—1 Cor., xiii. As life's illusions fade away, And things we once too fondly prized, Change, or deteriorate day by day, Then are forsaken or despised; How rich, immutable, and clear, Divine realities appear! That faith that feeds on things unseen, That hope which anchors on the cross, That love so ardent yet serene, Which counts what erst was gain but loss; This faith, and hope, and love divine, How firm they stand, how bright they shine! That lonely heart, which pined and sighed To settle down in earthly bliss, Now raised, set free, and purified, Pants for a fairer home than this. Its vain desires and cravings cease; “The work of righteousness is peace.” Faith brings the unseen world so near That present objects lose their power; Jesus Himself becomes so dear, So companies each lonely hour, That solitude grows far more sweet Than friends the most beloved to meet. And hope takes wing and upwards soars, Passing the narrow bounds of time; Those unimagined scenes explores, Above th' empyrean vault sublime; Where, though nor sun nor moon give light, The glorious day ne'er yields to night. And love undying, heaven-born love, Burns like a flame, within the soul; Burns, till the dross and tin remove, Till, freed from meaner love's control, The ethereal spirit finds its rest, Safe sheltered in Immanuel's breast. My Saviour! hast Thou given to me This faith, this hope, this heaven-born love? Then, till Thy beauty, Lord, I see, Till I behold Thy face above, Keep these rich treasures by Thy power; Guard them, increase them, every hour. THE GUARDIAN ANGEL'S WHISPER, ON LEAVING A FAVOURITE HOME. Beloved! art thou grieving To leave thy favourite spot? Bright visions wert thou weaving 'Midst ruins sin has wrought? Oh! could thy heavenly home be seen, One glance that clinging heart would wean. For thee there would be danger In a sweet place of rest; “A pilgrim and a stranger” Builds not on earth her nest. Beloved! build not thine below; Our sinless world thou soon wilt know. Oft when I see thee weary, Harassed without, within; And when life's path looks dreary, Through this dark world of sin, I long to hear the mandate given, To waft thee to our home in heaven. It will not last much longer, Life's toilsome, weary track; And as thy faith grows stronger, While calmly looking back, Thou wilt not wish thy lot to change, Or count the path of suffering strange. Thy Lord, the King of Glory, Once trod a wearier path; Our harps resound the story Of love more strong than death; The little flock His life-blood bought, Like Him through suffering must be brought. Oft will I sing, to cheer thee, Some notes of that sweet song; By night will linger near thee, Lest sleepless hours seem long; Those notes will make thee pant to dwell Where countless hosts His praises swell. Meanwhile, beloved one, hasten Swift on thy pilgrim way; Thy faith's strong vision fasten On heaven's unclouded ray: Waste not on earth immortal powers; Seek not for rest in earthly bowers. To win His glorious likeness, For this each effort strain; Shrink not from grief, pain, sickness, That image blest to attain: In Him, the all-perfect, thou wilt find Each matchless excellence combined. We chant His glorious praises, Unwearied day and night; The exhaustless theme still raises New wonder, new delight: Soon thou wilt share our blest employ, Entering into thy Master's joy. O CHRIST! MY HIDDEN LIFE DIVINE. O Christ! my hidden life divine, My “hope of glory” formed within; The new and hidden man “put on,” To be with glory crowned upon; My strength in weakness deign to be, Make Thy life manifest in me! When nature hastily would speak, And her own will and honour seek; When self would re-assume its sway, Let me resist, and not obey. My own I am not, nor would be; Make Thy life manifest in me! Thy Father's glory was Thine aim; Be mine, throughout each day, the same. It was Thy meat to do His will; The same alacrity instil. Grant me Thy high unwearied zest; In me Thy life make manifest! Let all my tempers, actions, words, Remodelled be, like Christ's, my Lord's! His meekness, gentleness, be mine! In me let His fair beauty shine! His likeness clearly be imprest! His life in me made manifest! Yea, let the indwelling of my God So beautify His mean abode, So all things to His power subdue, Making within, without, all new, That all around may clearly see His life made manifest in me! And oh! when flesh and heart shall fail, When I pass through death's shadowy vale; When flesh returns to dust again, And nature can no life retain; A well of life then in me be, There springing up eternally. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN AN OLD AND A YOUNG TRAVELLER ZIONWARDS. Q. Traveller through life's desert dreary! How has thy long journey sped?A. What though feeble, faint, and weary, Still I have been safely led By “a right way,” Through each snare around me spread. Q. Still thou'rt toil-worn; deep-wrought traces Mark thy brow, of pain and care!A. He who through a desert passes Perils and fatigues must share: From the outset, He, to face them, should prepare. Q. Didst thou thus thy spirit harden From the first, for toils and pains?A. No! earth seemed a flowery garden While I traversed childhood's plains; Life soon taught me Eden not for man remains. As my path grew rough and toilsome, Thorns and briars replacing flowers, I discovered reptiles noisome, Serpents hid in smiling bowers; Then, in earnest, Sought I fairer worlds than ours. Q. Is there then no track less sterile, Leading to that fairer shore? Thus beset with toil and peril, Can we no new path explore? Must each traveller Pass the same drear desert o'er? A. Youthful pilgrim! one path only Leads to Canaan's happy bound: Steep it is, and often lonely, Yet sweet solaces are found; Guardian angels Night and day that path surround. From its toils no longer shrinking, Hear what th' ancient travellers say; See them 'neath fair palm trees drinking, Cloud and pillar mark their way! Blessed foretastes E'en on earth their toils repay. Q. Traveller! wert thou never tempted To turn back, ere half way through? Grieving thou hadst e'er attempted Task too arduous to pursue? Way-worn pilgrim! If it were so, tell me true. A. No! whene'er my spirit fainted Some fair spot just then I gained, Whence, in heaven's own colours painted, Views of Canaan I obtained; While sweet voices Lured me on, and hope sustained. Then, as with a step less faltering, Onward, upward, still I went, By degrees, the rough path altering, Easier grew my swift ascent: Freshening breezes From the eternal hills were sent. Now those lovely hills grow clearer, Oft their outline fair I trace; As their glorious forms grow nearer How I chide my languid pace! How I weary Till I reach yon blissful place! LOOKING AND WAITING FOR THE LORD. A SONG IN THE NIGHT. “And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.”—Mark xiii., 37. In robes of white I fain would stand, Listening the Bridgeroom's call to hear; The angelic host—the saintly band; When will the glorious train appear? I watch, believing His sure word, Looking and waiting for the Lord. Oh! how I long to hear His voice, His unveiled glory to behold! There will my ransomed soul rejoice With joy, with ecstacy untold; Till then I watch, and keep His word, Looking and waiting for the Lord. Sleep weighs me down, against my will; Dark, long, and dreary seems the night; But I must watch, unwearied still, And trim my lamp and keep it bright; Must watch, according to His word, Looking and waiting for the Lord. “The children of the bride-chamber,” With them alone would I converse; Sweetly with them I would confer; The Bridegroom's glories would rehearse; Would praise His name, would search His word, Looking and waiting for the Lord. Their loins are girt, their lamps are bright, They watch, and keep their robes with care; They charm with holy songs the night; Their Saviour's lovely traits they wear; They feed, they banquet on His word, Looking and waiting for the Lord. Oft when my feebler spirit faints, My loved companions strength impart; “The faith and patience of the Saints” They sweetly press upon my heart; Lead me to rest on Christ's sure word, Looking and waiting for the Lord. Forsaking earth and earthly things, All sublunary thought and care; Our souls aspiring, plume their wings To meet the Bridegroom in the air; To win the “exceeding great reward,” To be “for ever with the Lord.” PSALM CXIX. 5, 97 AND FOLLOWING. Oh, how I love Thy law! Through each successive day From thence my happiness I draw, It cheers my pilgrim way. Through Thy commands I gain That wisdom from above, Which makes each foe's devices vain; My panoply they prove. By them my mind is fraught With knowledge pure and high; Such as by men can ne'er be taught, Veiled from the natural eye. The wisdom of the wise, The experience of the sage, These I excel because I prize Thy truth's illumined page. I have refrained my feet From every evil way; That I may find Thy words more sweet, And with more joy obey. Those who Thy precepts know Ne'er from Thy paths decline; To whom, beside Thee, should we go? The words of life are Thine. Oh, then preserve my heart From wandering Lord, from Thee! Since Thou my gracious teacher art, My guardian deign to be! How sweet Thy statutes are! By them alone I live. More dear Thy testimonies far Than ought the world can give. The light Thy words reflect, While at Thy feet I wait, Aids me each error to detect, And all false ways to hate. TO THE PASSING SPIRIT. Ransomed spirit! heavenward hasten! Death's rough hand will soon unfasten All thy bonds of clay! Now its radiant shores discerning, O'er thy native country yearning, To thy Father's house returning, Wing thy homeward way! Relatives and friends immortal Wait beyond that gloomy portal, Thy release to hail. Now thy term of exile over, Angel forms around thee hover, Waiting till thine eye discover All “within the veil.” O'er thy sorrowing friends thou grievest; God will comfort those thou leavest; God will be their stay! Brief will prove their sad privation, Glorious love's bright consummation; There, where comes not separation, Spirit! haste away! PRAYER TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. Holy Spirit! mighty God! Send Thy glorious light abroad, Through each chamber of my soul, Bending all to Thy control; All renewing, all transforming, My whole mind to Christ's conforming; What He values let me prize, Let me all things else despise. What did He of value deem? Did He this world's joys esteem? Wealth or grandeur, rank or fame, Did He seek them, or disclaim? Poor, despised, of humble birth, Having not a home on earth; Gold or silver, He had none, Called not ought on earth His own. Satan's empire to destroy Was His object and His joy; Heal the miseries caused by sin, For His Father souls to win; To the contrite peace to impart, Binding up the broken heart; Pouring light upon the mind, Vision on the inly blind. Thus His mission to fulfil, Thus to do His Father's will, Was the only joy He sought; Night and day for this He wrought. Sowing seed each day with care, Watering it each night with prayer; And with Godlike love and power Scattering blessings every hour. Wondrous was the race He ran, Marvellous His love to man! Meek and lowly, though so great, Washing His disciples' feet: He, the holiest, did descend To be called the “sinner's friend;” And to shame all human pride, “Numbered with transgressors” died. Blessed Spirit! by Thee led, In His footsteps let me tread; Seek the objects that He sought, Labour for the souls He bought; Pleasing not myself, but still Doing all my Father's will; Growing more and more in love, Till I see His face above! SUNDAY MORNING. Sabbath of rest, all hail! Sweet pause from earthly care! When the glad soul expands her wings, Forgets terrestrial thoughts and things, And breathes a purer air; Attunes her lyre, To that blest choir, She hopes ere long to join, whose themes her notes inspire. Sabbath of rest, all hail! Fair type of future bliss! Who comest like an angel sent To charm each week of banishment, Passed in a world like this; To urge the the soul To reach the goal, Where glory's fadeless wreath will all her griefs console. Sabbath of rest, all hail! Day of discourse divine! When He who once to Emmaus walked, With those who thought on Him, and talked, Draws near with love benign; To faith's clear eye, Seems very nigh; His glory deigns to unveil—His word to ratify. Sabbath of rest, all hail! Come thou, and set me free From earth's entanglements and cares, From sin's deceits, from Satan's snares! Let every sound I breathe around, With heaven's own choral song, in unison be found. Lord of the Sabbath! Thou Whose smile all joy inspires! Disclose the brightness of Thy face! Reveal the riches of Thy grace! Fill all my soul's desires! Her quickened ear, With filial fear, Words of eternal life now waits from Thee to hear. LIFE'S EVENING HOUR. Sweet is life's evening hour! The soul looks calmly back, O'er all the varied track, Passed through in comfort or in pain; In sunshine now, and now in rain; And thinks a few rough stages more Will land her on that peaceful shore, Where, by no weariness opprest, She will enjoy an endless rest. Sweet is life's evening hour! Its business and its toil, Its bustle and turmoil, “The heat and burden of the day;” These have for ever passed away. That holy calm succeeds, The fainting spirit needs, Meekly, in peace, by faith and prayer, For its last conflict to prepare. Sweet is life's evening hour! What though the enfeebled frame Some anxious thought will claim; Dearer each day becomes the hope, Firmer its ground, more wide its scope, That soon a wondrous change, More glorious e'en than strange, This frame will suddenly transform, And make it like the Saviour's form. Sweet is life's evening hour! The Christian's steadfast eye Fixed on the sunset sky, Behind those crimson clouds of gold, Sees brighter, lovelier scenes unfold; Through the still air he hears Sounds from those upper spheres, Which make him long to flee away, And burst the encumbering bonds of clay! Sweet is life's evening hour! The tranquil contrite breast In simple faith doth rest; Grasps the salvation, full and free, Wrought out by Christ eternally; He, in his last long sleep, His child will safely keep; And when the eternal dawn shall break, Oh! to what rapture will he wake! [Poor fainting spirit, still hold on thy way] “The day is at hand.” Poor fainting spirit, still hold on thy way, The dawn is near! True, thou art weary; but yon brightening ray Becomes more clear. Bear up a little longer—wait for rest— Yield not to slumber, though with toil opprest. The night of life is mournful—but look on— The dawn is near! Soon will earth's shadowy scenes and forms be gone, Yield not to fear! The mountain's summit will, ere long, be gained, And a bright world of joy and peace attained. “Joyful through hope” thy motto still must be; The dawn is near! What glories will that dawn unfold to thee! Be of good cheer! Gird up thy loins; bind sandals on thy feet; The way is dark and long, the end is sweet. [Why, why art thou so fearful] “Be not afraid! only believe.” Why, why art thou so fearful, O thou of little faith? Why faint, desponding, tearful, Forgetting One who saith— “Let not your heart be troubled, Nor let it be afraid;” The charge repeated, doubled, Enforces what He said. Each dark and threatening presage Fulfils His sacred word; Each judgment bears His message, Death, pestilence, the sword: He over all presideth, Withdrawn in light serene; Each wheel minutely guideth Of earth's immense machine. And still, though skies are darkening, His children must not fear; To those sweet accents hearkening, Which whisper, “He draws near.” My soul, in Him confiding, Thy rock, thy hiding-place, Beneath His wings abiding, Wait thou to see His face. To herald His appearing, These awful signs are sent; These storms the skies are clearing; Soon will the veil be rent: Then, with His saints surrounding Him thou hast long adored, Will thy sweet harp be sounding, “For ever with the Lord.” DEATH. I know not how, or when, or where My parting summons may be given; This costs me now no anxious care— Since One who cares for me in heaven Has promised never to forsake me, And when I go to come and take me. 'Tis true death seems an awful change, The soul and body dread to part; An untried being, new and strange, From this frail nature back would start; But not till death my bonds dissever Can I be with my Lord for ever. 'Twas He who called me into life, He has watched o'er me all my days; And in this last, this fearful strife, Can He not perfect His own praise? And show, though dying pangs may prove me, He to the end will keep and love me. SONG OF THE SEAWEEDS. We come to tell of a world unseen, Where the eye of man has never been; But where the glance of God most high Has lighted up worlds of brilliancy. We come from the waters far beneath To cast on your shore a varied wreath, And to tell you that He who in beauty delights To His works unseen your search invites. We come to bid you lift your eye To His radiant dwelling beyond the sky; And think what order and beauty are there, When in ocean's depths there are things so fair. “Consider” these flowers of ocean's cave, Dashed to your feet by the tempest's wave; And believe that blessings of holiest form May be sent to your bosom in sorrow's storm. M. B. [Spirit, why so fondly cling] “Arise and depart; this is not your rest.” Spirit, why so fondly cling To this dark terrestrial spot? Look beyond it! spread thy wing! Hasten homeward—linger not! Why uncertain changes dread? Filled with apprehensive thought— Ere they come thou may'st have fled; Why forecast them? fear them not! Are thy loved ones gone before? Partings are the traveller's lot; Once at home they part no more; There they wait thee, grieve thou not. Shrink'st thou from the dying strife? Let that friend be ne'er forgot, Who in death will prove thy life; Haste to meet Him, doubt Him not. Soon no clog will weigh thee down; Soon no stain thy robe will blot: Christ will place thee near His throne, Happy spirit! linger not. A HYMN OF PRAISE.—WALKING ABROAD. Lord of the mountains, and the hills! Lord of the rivers, and the vales! Thy glory all creation fills; Thy goodness all creation hails. While these Thy works delight our eyes, So rich, diversified, and fair, Let praise within our hearts arise, Let gratitude be glowing there. Let Spring's fair promise, Summer's charms, Autumnal beauties, full and free, Each wintry hearth Thy kindness warms, Awake the song of praise to Thee. Let the first blush of rosy light Call forth the consecrated strain! Let silvery stars and moonbeams bright Wake the sweet melodies again! While noontide zephyrs, breathing balm, Waft the rich scent of plant and flower, Let praise, 'mid adoration's calm, With the heart's incense fill the hour. Let childhood's voice to Thee direct Its morning hymn, its evening thought; Let manhood's ripened intellect, To praise Thee all its powers devote. And oh, when we have past away, When all our generation sleep, Let those we train take up the lay, And with heaven's choir sweet concert keep! THE ROSE OF SHARON. Sonnet. There was a little plot of garden ground On which, though warmed with sunshine, fed with dew, Nothing for long long years but thistles grew; Nor flowers nor pleasant fruits could there be found, Though genial showers full oft the soil unbound. At length the Heavenly Husbandman, who knew What means alone each hindrance could subdue, Placed in that garden Sharon's rose, renowned. When it took root and budded—oh! what change Through its sweet influence met the observer's eye; The soil was all transformed, and, passing strange, Soon round that rose sprang flowers of every dye. To it they owed their birth, and each inhaled From it a separate scent—fragrance that never failed. SATURDAY NIGHT. “God requireth that which is past.”—Eccles. iii., 15. My fleeting days glide on with noiseless haste, “A shadow that departeth,” I go hence; Another week, its term of service past, Points to its follower, waiting to commence. Each comes in silence, leads me on my way A little further, then the task resigns. They note the hours, the moments of their stay, To Him they tell them who their post assigns. There is a book which no erasures blot; A register of days, and weeks, and hours; He who records them faints nor wearies not, His mind no multiplicity o'erpowers. And when the books are opened at the last, That secret volume shall unfolded be; And then the history of each moment past, Whilst there I stand, the assembled world shall see. THE PEACE OF GOD. “The Peace of God!”—The very sound Diffuses hallowed influence round; Tells of a high mysterious good, Felt, but how little understood! “The Peace of God!”—Oh! were it ours, Life's thorny path would teem with flowers; E'en earth become a little heaven To those to whom this peace is given. “The peace of God!”—This calms the soul, When round it waves of trouble roll; A citadel divine it forms! Impregnable to winds and storms. “The peace of God!”—Oh! it has power To irradiate e'en the darkest hour; To cheer, to bless the saddest heart, And shield it from each fiery dart. “The peace of God!”—I ask no more, My Saviour, till I reach that shore, Where not an enemy assails, But peace, eternal peace prevails. [Eternal life! eternal life!] “That ye may know that ye have eternal life.”—I John v., 13. Eternal life! eternal life! Who knows what these brief words imply? None till they pass the final strife; To understand them we must die. The words imply so high a state, Purchased for man at such a cost, That when I strive to meditate On their full meaning, I am lost. Here all things change, and all things end, Our sweetest pleasures quickly pass; The dearest tie, the loveliest friend, We lose them all too soon, alas! But those who that pure life attain No change will fear, no end foresee; No painful loss can they sustain; Perfect their happiness will be. No ignorance, darkness, nor decay, No death, no sorrow, and no sin; The former things all pass'd away, All pure, all bright, around, within. There shall be no more curse to mar The beauties of that world serene; No sound of tumult or of war; Christ in His glory shall be seen. Oh! can we in this vale of tears Imagine such a life as this? 'Midst earthly conflicts, foes and fears, How can we realize its bliss? And yet, through Thine unbounded love, Most blessed Jesus, even now This life is mine, secured above— Is not Thy seal upon my brow? Hast Thou not washed me in Thy blood? Does not Thy Spirit in me plead? And Thou, my advocate with God, Dost Thou not ever intercede? Let me then firmly grasp the hope Of everlasting life in heaven; Till, while Thine angels bear me up, “Abundant entrance” shall be given. HYMN ON PROVERBS III., 3, 4, 5. Oh, precious beyond all compare, My God! Thy testimonies are; When entering this unfathomed mine, I search its treasury divine; The further, deeper I explore, More rich becomes the golden ore. A wondrous light diffused around Shines o'er the consecrated ground; Bright are the gems discovered there, The crystal lamps, the vistas fair,— While oft, like music of the spheres, Celestial sounds the listener hears. Lord! since my eyes have been unsealed To view the wonders there revealed, Earth's richest treasures seem but toys, Childish illusions all its joys; Whate'er I study, hear, or read, With these compared, seem poor indeed. The light that from Thy word has shone This world has into shadow thrown; Has oped to my illumined eye The realms of immortality, And spread before my wondering sight Eternity's perspective bright. Here will I seek, from day to day, For treasures none can take away; On new discoveries still intent Pass my brief term of banishment, Till the glad homeward call be given, And clearer light shall dawn from heaven. MISSIONARY HYMN. “Freely thou hast received, freely give.” Christian! has not much been given thee? Hast thou not from death been freed? Debts, vast debts have been forgiven thee— Christ has made thee free indeed. Hast thou no return to render To the God of peace and love? Grace so boundless, love so tender— Nought thy gratitude to prove? Hast thou affluence? know 'twas lent thee Largely to employ for Him: Let no scanty gifts content thee; Let not rust thy fine gold dim. Hast thou influence, knowledge, leisure? Wouldst thou show to Christ thy love? Be it thy sole aim and pleasure, For His glory each to improve. Hast thou youth and health and vigour? Hardships fear'st thou not to meet? Nor of tropic climes the rigour, Scorching wind, or sultry heat? Cast not then a look behind thee! Take thy staff and travel on! Let not home, friends, country, bind thee, Martyn, Cary, Swartz, are gone! Wrap their fallen mantle round thee; In the name of Christ be strong! None shall vanquish or confound thee, He will wreathe thy brow ere long. Love that shrinks from toil is hollow, Love the heaviest cross can bear; In thy Master's footsteps follow, All thy wants shall be His care. Think what He endured to save thee, Think what home He left for thee; Spend for Him the life He gave thee, All besides is vanity. [Mourn not for those who die!] “Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.” Mourn not for those who die! If suffering nature, sad and weak, Must shed the tear and heave the sigh, Wouldst thou the well of comfort seek? Mourner! thy lost ones live on high! The Father has but called His own; Bend thee, and say, “Thy will be done!” Mourn not for them! Mourn not! they are not dead! No, they have burst the galling chain That bound them to this dungeon world; Their souls with their Redeemer reign; Love's banner o'er them floats unfurled! For ever and for ever bless'd Are they who in their Saviour rest; Mourn not for them! Mourn not! they live for aye! Death's stingless shafts in vain are cast, And vainly yawns the grave's deep gloom; The tyrant's shadowy reign is past, Burst the dark barriers of the tomb! Sin dies in death! all sorrow dies! To endless bliss the ransomed rise! Rejoice for them! Anonymous. [When earth's supports and comforts fail] “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.” —Ps. cxxi., 1. When earth's supports and comforts fail, When shadows lengthen o'er the vale, When those who loved us fall asleep, And leave us still to watch and weep; Then grasp the hope so freely given, Then turn from earth and look to heaven! When still where'er the eye is cast It meets a lone and dreary waste, And, stripped of all its summer leaves, Life's wilderness thy spirit grieves; Then to faith's eye new worlds are given: O turn from earth and look to heaven! His hand whose guidance cannot err, Thy Father, Saviour, Comforter; Him, whom thine heartfelt praises bless, Guides, guards thee through the wilderness; And hourly cordials shall be given, Till earth shall be exchanged for heaven! NEW YEAR'S DAY. “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.” Repeat those gracious words to me, Grant me, my Saviour, Thy sweet peace; And let my heart not troubled be, And bid these fears, which wrong Thee, cease. Not as the world gives, givest Thou; Its gifts ne'er satisfy the heart; But those Thou deignest to bestow Peace, peace ineffable, impart. Now through this newly opening year, Through all its scenes unknown, untried, Let this sweet peace my spirit cheer, Rule in my heart, and there abide. If troubles come, and come they must, Let me on Thy sure promise rest; Let nothing shake my filial trust, Let nothing agitate my breast. Whisper, when waves around me swell, “Soon, very soon, 'twill all be o'er, And that sweet sentence, ‘All is well,’ Shall greet thee on the heavenly shore.” “HE SLEEPS IN JESUS.” He sleeps in Jesus—dost thou weep? Tranquil, yea hallowed is that sleep; The shadow of the Almighty One Around his resting-place is thrown. He sleeps in Jesus—on that bed Where once was laid the Saviour's head; His presence has endeared the spot, And those who love Him fear it not. He sleeps in Jesus—never more Of death to feel the awful power; Never to strive with sin again, Never to know distress or pain. He sleeps in Jesus—check thy grief; The time of absence will be brief; And that loved voice, though silent now, Will greet thee where no tear can flow. He sleeps in Jesus—at his waking Of glorious, endless life partaking; That slumbering form shall be restored, Bright in the image of the Lord. MUSINGS. There is a depth, a fulness in the soul, Which tell 'twas formed for immortality; Its strong aspirings earth can ne'er control, And nothing finite can its portion be; Towards an unseen, eternal goal it tends, And onwards, upwards, ceaselessly ascends. And this is well, O Christian! well to know, Though comforts may abound on every side, Thy soul can find no settled rest below. Though heavenly mercy o'er thy lot preside, Still will thy heart with yearnings deep be filled For something far beyond what earth can yield. What else could mean that language of the saints, Waiting the term of their appointed years? “To see Thy face, O God, my spirit faints!” Thus spake the apostles, patriarchs, martyrs, seers; While each and all exclaimed successively, “A pilgrim and a stranger here am I.” Then, Christian, welcome every outward change That tends from this poor world thy heart to wean; Welcome events unlooked for, painful, strange, Which cast a shade o'er all thine earthly scene; Bereavements, partings, disappointed hopes, Clinging too fondly to terrestrial props. Welcome the crook then in thy daily lot, The burden each successive morn supplies; Welcome the uprooting from each favourite spot; “He builds too low who builds below the skies;” There dwells that Saviour who has died for thee; And where thy treasure is, thy heart should be. [It is well, and just, and right] “Arise ye and depart; this is not your rest.”—Mic. ii., 10. It is well, and just, and right, Traveller to a home of bliss! That but little to delight Meets thee in a world like this: It is well that thou shouldst bear, Day by day some cross and care. Be the trials what they may, Is it not, alas! too true, Thou wouldst linger here, and stay When thou shouldst be hastening through, With a pilgrim's step and eye To thy home beyond the sky? Leave thy heavenly Lord to choose All thy path, nor faint, nor tire; Nothing He appoints refuse; Nothing He withholds desire; While by His own hand thou'rt led, Thou no devious path wilt tread. And when shadows gather round, Drawing towards the darksome vale; When the briars and thorns abound, And thy faith and courage fail; Then repeat, to cheer the gloom, “I am hastening quickly home.” HOLY COMFORTER! MY GUIDE! Holy Comforter! my Guide! Now within my heart abide; Nothing do I need beside; Fill my soul with light. Each celestial truth reveal; Christ's rich treasury unseal; Thine indwelling let me feel, Fount of pure delight! While a little longer space, Here my lonely path I trace, Pour within rich streams of grace; Form a garden there. Then, though all around may be But a wilderness for me, Sheltered from its dearth by Thee, All things will seem fair. While Thou deign'st my heart to bless With Thy presence, Thy sweet peace, Can I pine in loneliness? Can I wish for more? No! Thou Comforter divine, If Thy fellowship be mine, Earthly converse I resign, Fondly prized before. Life was for this end bestowed, To acquaint myself with God: Oft the loneliest pathway trod Nearer leads to Him. Guide into all truth! be Thou My divine Instructor now; Be my views no longer low, Indistinct and dim! Rend the darkening veil that shrouds Those bright scenes above the clouds; Shew me those serene abodes Where “is no more night.” Where the Father and the Son, With Thyself for ever one, Shed from the eternal throne Everlasting light. Then will all the shadows here Lose their charms, and disappear, Lost in that resplendent sphere Opened to faith's eye. Quickened by its glorious ray I shall hasten on my way, Till I drop these bonds of clay And to Jesus fly. I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THEE FROM ABOVE. “Doth not wisdom cry, and understanding put forth her voice?” Prov. viii., 1. I have a message for thee from above, Light-hearted pilgrim, commencing thy course, A message of mercy, a message of love, Experience its value, and truth will enforce. Life's pathway before thee is flowery and bright, This message will teach thee to read it aright. “Remember,” in these the bright days of thy youth, “Thy Creator,” thy Saviour, thy Guardian, thy Friend, Acquaint thyself with Him, then mercy and truth, Like angels beside thee, thy path shall attend. Thy course shall be blameless, thy heart shall find rest, And thou shalt reach safely the home of the blest. I have a message for thee from above, Wayfaring traveller, weary and worn; The burden and heat of the day thou must prove; Toil and fatigue must be patiently borne. Yet, if thou shalt faint not, but hold on thy way, The prize that awaits thee all toil will repay. I have a message to thee from above, Desolate pilgrim, bereaved and alone; None are now left thee, to tend, and to love, Thy treasures, the light of thy dwelling, are gone. Oh! fly to His bosom, where sweetly they sleep— There only the mourner forgetteth to weep. I have a message to thee from above, Aged believer, whose end draweth nigh; Soon will the clouds and the shadows remove, Soon will heaven's vision enrapture the eye. Thy mansion long since did thy Saviour prepare, And now He is waiting to welcome thee there. SONNET ON THE SCRIPTURES. There is a wondrous volume, on whose page Shines heavenly truth in characters of light, For ever lasting and for ever bright, Immutably the same from age to age; Its light is life. Philosopher and sage Dwell on its charms with reverence and delight, When from earth's film their intellectual sight The Spirit deigns to cleanse and disengage. All other volumes lose their zest and tire; But this, the more its treasures we unfold, Exceeding far the costliest gems or gold, Fills to the utmost all the soul's desire: Wisdom to guide, and balm to heal, supplies; Enlightens, comforts, cheers, and satisfies. [The very sound] “Stand, therefore, having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.” —Eph. vi., 15. The very sound Breathes peace around! These heaven-wrought sandals, where can they be found? The feet are torn With many a thorn, Till, without money bought, this panoply be worn. The art divine, Their braid to twine, Lies hid in hallowed oracles divine; It will be taught, When meekly sought; It charms the observer's eye to see the texture wrought. For colours bright, With heaven's own light, Glow on these sandals, each disposed aright; Its cloth of gold Will wax not old, But, year by year, new tints, new lustre will unfold. Still bright, still new; Though strange, 'tis true, They last unfaded life's long journey through: Where'er they tread A light is shed; They strengthen, while they adorn, the footsteps heaven-ward led. Through brake and briar, Through flood and mire, These sandals pass unsoiled, still, still ascending higher: The pathway trod By feet thus shod Leads safely, swiftly home, to glory and to God. THE PATH OF THE JUST. “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” I view an upward path of light, Winding round many a beauteous height, And rising, rising still; Till that resplendent spot be gained, By mortal footstep ne'er attained; Zion's celestial hill. Those who from thence the prospect hail, First drop mortality's dark veil, And angel robes put on; We, who have loved to track their way, Just view them catch the ethereal ray; But while we gaze, they're gone. Still they have left a golden line Of heavenly radiance, which will shine Long, long to memory's eye; Bidding us tread the path they trod E'en till we share their bright abode, Their pure felicity. ON PSALM XLVI., 4. Fountain bright, of living waters! Now refresh my fainting soul, 'Tis for Zion's sons and daughters Thy sweet streams abundant roll; Palms bloom round which never fade; Let me rest beneath their shade! Glorious Rock of my salvation! Forth from Thee these waters spring; Millions in each age, and nation, Bless the life and health they bring: Health that e'en in sickness thrives; Life, that death itself survives. I am here a passing stranger, For my heavenly home I pine; Pain and suffering, toil and danger, Here must chasten and refine; Still I can “rejoice in hope,” Soon will Zion's portals ope. Though the wilderness be dreary, Yet, refreshed by this sweet fount, I shall “run and not be weary;” And as upward still I mount, Zion's towers, to charm my eyes, Beauteous, in the distance, rise. Fountain bright of living waters! Every pilgrim's strength repair; Till Jehovah's sons and daughters All be gathered safely there; When thy gates of pearl unclose, Welcome lasting, sweet repose! WRITTEN FOR A WIDOWED FRIEND. Lord, behold me now in sadness, Desolate, and sick at heart; Earthly comforts, nature's gladness, Now no cheerfulness impart: He who shared them once is gone; I am weary, left alone. Thou the gracious words hast spoken, “Let thy widows trust in me;” This poor heart, through crushed and broken, Turns confidingly to Thee: Still in Thee I may be blest; Thou canst give the weary rest. Saviour! Thy compassions fail not. A poor widow once, of yore, When Thou badest her bewail not, At Thy bidding wept no more: Cannot that same voice divine Check these flowing tears of mine? Shall distress, however bitter, Separate my soul from Thee? No! distress but makes it fitter To my hiding-place to flee: Though of all beside bereft, 'Tis enough if Thou art left. Has it been Thy will to sever Life-long union, dearest ties? Whisper, “I will leave thee never;” This shall check my tears and sighs: Not thus desolate should be One whose mind is stayed on Thee. Welcome all that makes Thee dearer, Faithful, never-changing Friend! To Thyself that draws me nearer, Makes my bliss on Thee depend; Every void Thy love can fill, Still to good transmuting ill. Soon the term of separation, Now so tedious, will be o'er; Faith's endurance and probation Will be needed then no more; And, till then, my loved one's joy Shall my constant thoughts employ. A MEDITATION AND PRAYER. “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God,” &amp;c.— Deut. xxix., 29. O God, my God, these aching thoughts control! Still the deep, restless yearnings of my soul, In endless mazes of conjecture lost! Bewilder'd, baffled, wearied, tempest-toss'd; Striving in vain those clouds to penetrate, Which hide my future, my eternal state. Check these tumultuous thoughts, so strong, so wild; Let me not be by Satan's snares beguiled; The things revealed alone belong to man; Why strive deep hidden mysteries to scan? “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;” Lord! as a little child I fain would be. My restless soul! what do those thoughts avail? Why strive to pierce the impenetrable veil? Alas, thy faith amounts not yet to sight! How should the finite grasp the infinite? How should an atom on this earthly ball Search out the great First Cause, God over all? This present life is but my infancy; Even the objects which around I see Are full of secrets, still but little known, Though earth's six thousand years some light have thrown. But all beyond, vast, vast eternity, Is veiled from man, an undiscovered sea! None has returned from that mysterious bourne; Millions have passed away, and those we mourn Are living somewhere, but we know not where; Faith only tells what blessedness they share; And its bright lamp, hung o'er the gulf of night, “Brings life and immortality to light.” They fell asleep in Jesus, they are blest; This must suffice me, on this truth I rest; But the bright marvels of that unknown shore, As yet, 'tis not permitted to explore; But yet a little while and I shall know, (For God has said it) what I know not now. “A meek and quiet spirit,” this I ask; Fulfilling daily my appointed task; Sitting, like Mary, at the Master's feet, Aiming at nothing high, at nothing great; Content from Him all knowledge to receive, Nor seeking more than He is pleased to give. [Lord! I feel in constant danger] “For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.” Heb. xiii., 14. Lord! I feel in constant danger, Of forgetting what I am; As a pilgrim and a stranger, To pass through this world I came; To press on, from day to day, Never wishing here to stay. When my cup is filled with sweetness, Circled round with those I love, I forget time's awful fleetness; I forget my home above; Then I loiter and delay, Nor press on from day to day! And when hopes and comforts wither, And this world a waste appears, Bidding me to hasten thither, Where there shall be no more tears, Do I then the call obey, Pressing on, from day to day? No! I sit me down complaining, Looking round, with tearful eyes, When each nerve I should be straining To secure the heavenly prize; Casting care and grief away; Pressing on, from day to day. Thou! who canst control each feeling; Thou! who every thought canst sway; Now, Thy loveliness revealing, Draw me heavenward, day by day; Till I see Thee face to face, Be Thyself my dwelling-place. [Ye bright ones and ye blessed ones] “Ye are come to the spirits of just men made perfect.”— Heb. xii., 23. Ye bright ones and ye blessed ones, “Not lost but gone before!” I love your holy memories, I prize them more and more; I long indeed to be like you, From this dark world dismiss'd; Till then I fain would follow you, E'en as ye followed Christ. How meekly and how patiently Ye trod your pilgrim path! How bravely and unflinchingly Ye fought the fight of faith! Full many a grief and chastisement Your Lord saw fit to send, Ye bore them all submissively, Enduring to the end. The world's reproach, its blandishments, Alike were cast aside; Ye heeded not the “stranger's voice,” But clinging to your Guide, Ye followed on, unweariedly, Supported by His arm; He rescued you from every snare, He sheltered you from harm. Through years of patient suffering, Through days of toil or pain, Ye wrestled perseveringly The victory to gain; Ye deemed earth's transient sufferings light, And not to be compared With the transcendent prize in view, “The exceeding great reward.” Ye bright ones, and ye blessed ones, “Not lost, but gone before,” When faint and weary in my race, Your path I ponder o'er; I mark how Jesus led you on Through all your journey's length, And made you “more than conquerors:” This thought revives my strength. ON SEEING THE ISLE OF WIGHT AFTER SUNSET. It was evening, and bright was the glow of the west; The sun in calm splendour had sunk to his rest; And twilight drew near, with her shadowy vest, Earth, ocean, and sky to enfold: When gazing afar on the bright heaving surge, I beheld a fair island in beauty emerge, Which seemed, as it touched the horizon's gay verge, Reposing on fleeces of gold. Then it led me to think on the Christian's decline, When the natural sun seems but faintly to shine, How there breaks o'er his evening a lustre divine, Which reveals a celestial abode: Though the shadows around may be gathering fast, And a flood lies between, whose rough wave must be pass'd, The light lingers round that fair spot to the last, Till the Spirit return to his God. HYMN OF THE MAGI.—IRREGULAR.First Voice. What means that wondrous star, Bright streaming from afar? Not like a lurid meteor's blaze, But with benign and silvery rays, Prophetic of good things! See how it lightens all the sky, Yon radiant ensign, waving high! Surely good news it brings!Second Voice. Yes! brother, doubt it not; We, who with earnest thought, And soul-felt reverence, and prayer, And midnight toil, and ceaseless care, Wisdom have asked from heaven; We have not poured our prayers in vain, Celestial guidance to obtain; To us that sign is given.First Voice. See, see it moves along, Heaven's wondering hosts among! Making the brightest stars look dim! Can it be sent to tell of Him, By ancient seers foretold, Who in far distant lands had heard Records, their inmost souls that stirred, From parchments prized as gold?Second Voice. Brother! the more I gaze With reverend amaze On that fair messenger of light, Which now to-day transforms our night, My sanguine hopes grow strong: Lo! as if sent to guide our way, It pauses, seems for us to stay, And beckons us along!First Voice. Mysterious, new-born light! Could I but read aright Thine errand to this world of ours, Each science which has tasked my powers Gladly would I forego. But see, our gifted brother comes! Some welcome news his eye illumes, Joy sparkles on his brow!Third Voice. Brothers! we need no more Yon sapphire vault explore, Searching heaven's star-writ auguries: He, who those argent lamps supplies With their perpetual light, Leaves not the souls that seek His aid To wander, lost in error's shade, But guides their course aright. Ere blush of dawn to-day, Wrapt in a trance I lay, And heard a voice distinctly speak— “Judea's far-famed country seek; Go to Jerusalem.” Let us set out this eventide, Yon beauteous star our steps shall guide, Trust we its heaven-lit beam!The Three Voices in Chorus. Judea! favoured land! We seek thy hallowed strand; Our home we leave, our kindred dear, Without delay, regret, or fear: God calls, and we obey. He kindled yon refulgent star, To herald One more glorious far; Haste we to greet His ray! Like them, I haste away; Called from above, obey; And seek the blest, the holy land; Within thy walls my feet shall stand, Jerusalem above! There joined with those who kneel around Immanuel's throne, with glory crowned, I will adore His love. “FAINT, YET PURSUING.” My body is weary and weak, My spirits are low and depressed; My Saviour! Thy sheltering wings I will seek, For there is my refuge and rest. Some message of love I shall hear, Some whisper to comfort my heart; Some gracious assurance to banish my fear, Some promise new strength to impart. The night of my life is far spent, Some streaks of the dawning I see; Till the day-star arise and the vail shall be rent, My mind shall be stayed upon Thee. One blessing alone I desire, The sense of Thy presence and love; No more for my happiness, Lord, I require, Or here, or in mansions above. MEDITATION ON THE FIRST EIGHT VERSES OF THE LAST CHAPTER OF ST. MARK'S GOSPEL. Mysterious Golgotha! Thy scene had closed; Among the dead, the Prince of Life reposed; And twilight's shadows rested, soft and still, On Salem's towers, and Zion's far-famed hill. Yet, 'mid the stillness of the silent night, What mean those sudden rays of silvery light Which glide o'er that fair garden, through the gloom, And frequent flash from yonder new-made tomb? Surely, some spirits of the upper air, Some angel ministrant, are busied there; Well may they, wondering, watch the dark abode, There sleeps in death, the holy One of God! Bright rose the morning o'er that hallowed spot; O! 'twas a Sabbath ne'er to be forgot; For ere its radiance gladdened all beneath, The Prisoner of the Tomb had conquered death. A mighty earthquake told the victory won— The stone was rolled away—th' affrighted soldiers gone! And now, methinks, I view that female band, As heart-struck, weeping, in the tomb they stand; “Where lies the mangled form of Him we loved? Whither, oh; whither is our Lord removed?” But lo! the heavenly watcher meets their sight, Arrayed in garments of resplendent white; What varying feelings in their looks contend! Fear and amazement all their grief suspend; Breathless they listen to the angel voice— “Be not affrighted—let your hearts rejoice! “But seek not Jesus now, among the dead, “He is not here, but risen, as He said; “See where the Lord was laid; then go your way “To His disciples the glad news convey; “And tell them, and tell Peter, they shall see “Their living risen Lord in Galilee!” Oh! there was one to whose repentant grief, These words alone could minister relief; One, who sad vigils through the night had kept, And, through the day, in bitterness had wept; False he had proved, and faithless to his Lord, And thrice denied the Master he adored; One look he caught from that benignant eye Before they led Him to the cross to die; Then he beheld, unable to withdraw, The strangest saddest sight the world e'er saw, And from that hour had sat and mourned apart, Feeling the anguish of a broken heart. Oh! when the Saviour's message meets his ear, To him, by name addressed, to banish fear, What hopes within his aching heart arise! What tears of grateful joy bedew his eyes! While love, and glowing gratitude, by turns, Each in his ardent breast intensely burns. This holy flame, from heaven enkindled now Ceased not throughout his future life to glow With zeal untired, with courage calm and high. He ran his glorious race triumphantly; With all a Prophet's energy he taught And fed the little flock his Master bought; Laboured and suffered through a lengthened life, Joyful through hope, and tranquil amidst strife; And having gladly published far and wide The blessed name of Him he once denied, He on the cross, like Him, resigned his breath, And sealed his witness with a martyr's death. A WINTER SUNSET. Dark clouds hung brooding o'er the cold gray sea, And wintry blasts all mournfully swept by; But in th' horizon, towards the western sky, One spot like burnished gold appeared to be; An emblem glad, and beautiful to see: For there the wave met day's refulgent eye, And not one envious shadow lingered nigh, Where poured his stream of splendour, full and free. Christian! this typifies thy life's dark stream, Throughout its course o'erhung with many a cloud; While brief and fitful is the golden gleam, That tells how bright a sun those vapours shroud; But when the wave reflects the setting ray, A flood of glory melts each cloud away. THE DOVE. The Spirit left His bright abode In unseen realms above; And, resting on the Son of God, Descended “like a dove.” Did He not wear that form so meek, Our thoughtful hearts to move? To say what likeness we must seek— That of the spotless dove? We must take wing and upward soar, And heavenward swiftly move; Clinging to earthly scenes no more, But fluttering like the dove. Gentle and soft—diffusing peace Breathing sweet notes of love; Our melodies must rarely cease, Though plaintive like the dove. Where do we find our place of rest, The home our spirits love? Only in our Redeemer's breast, Like the celestial dove. ON HEARING RELUCTANCE EXPRESSED TO HAVE THE FULL AGE KNOWN. When we travel to meet a friend we love, Whom we ardently long to see, Too fast can the wheels of our chariot move? Too swift can our progress be? We measure the distance, we number the miles, Count them over again and again; And say, while the reckoning our journey beguiles, Now only so many remain! And still, as each milestone flies rapidly past Between us and that friend so dear, Our thoughts thronging quickly, our pulse beating fast, Foretell the glad meeting draws near. Should it not be thus, while on earth we stay, And our heavenward journey pursue? Each annual milestone we pass on our way, Brings us nearer that spot we would view. The spot where that unseen friend resides, Whom we treasure the most in our hearts; How often we long where He dwells to abide, And to feel what His presence imparts. Will it cast a shade o'er our brow to be told More than half of our journey is o'er? Shall we grieve to be thought, or to be growing old, When 'tis nearness to heaven we deplore? If now to that Saviour's smile we owe The happiest moments we spend, Oh! what will it be all His glory to know, And to dwell with Him world without end? The worldling may dread to grow old, may shun His number of years to reveal; But the Christian, whose true life seems here scarce begun, Is he anxious his age to conceal? When his life is hidden with Christ in God, Each year as it wings its flight And bears him on to that blest abode, Should be numbered with fresh delight. So that all around him may clearly see He rejoices in time's swift pace, Because he longs with his Lord to be, He pants to behold His face. [Traveller on earth! mark well its fabric rare] “All Thy works praise Thee; and Thy Saints give thanks unto Thee.” Traveller on earth! mark well its fabric rare, So passing fair! Survey its leafy aisles, its towering dome; Let thine eye roam O'er all the beauteous colours there inlaid, The star-embroidered tracery displayed. Then listen to its choir—their matin song So sweet, yet strong! And when the sun declines and day grows dim, Their vesper hymn! While soft responses woods and waters make, As gentle winds their sweet low voices wake. Nor wants there fragrant incense, heavenward borne Both night and morn, From dew-decked flowers, earth's habitants unstained, Who pure remained When fell that blight the moral garden shares; Of Eden telling, each his censer bears. Christian! the priest of this ethereal fane, Mark not in vain Its fair proportions, its melodious choir; The altar's fire Thy sacrifice must call for; lowly bend, Offer Thy heart, then will the flame descend. Watchers unseen, from the upper Temple sent, Listening attent, Stand mid the leafy arches, till thou grace The foremost place, And lead the choirs, and make its songs to be An echo of its own sweet minstrelsy. ON THE FIRST STONE BEING LAID OF A CHURCH CALLED CHRIST CHURCH AT MUSSOORIE IN THE HIMALAYAH MOUNTAINS. Hark! Hark! to Christian voices, 'Mid Himalayah's snows! “The wilderness rejoices,” And blossoms as the rose! “The morning star” appearing Lights up the glittering peaks; The shadowy mists are clearing, The dawn of glory breaks! Behold upon the mountains His footsteps beauteous gleam, Who bears from living fountains Truth's fertilizing stream! The rock-hewn paths ascending To fair Mussoorie's height, Groups on the hill-side blending, Throng round him with delight. In breathless silence listening, The joyful sound they hear, And many an eye is glistening With meek devotion's tear; Sweet plants that else had perished Spring up and bloom anew; There none their growth had cherished, Nor fed with pastoral dew. A Christian Bishop traces, Of “Christ's own Church,” the site The engraven first stone places, With England's hallowing rite; Then praise to God all render, In strains of other lands, While nature, robed in splendour, A silent witness stands. Bright angels, spread your pinions! Waft the glad news to heaven! From Satan's dark dominions Another tract is riven! Where hymns were never chanted, Where prayers were never poured, Immanuel's Cross is planted, Immanuel's name adored. SONNET. [Jerusalem, blest city of our God!] Jerusalem, blest city of our God! How oft the Pilgrim's thoughts on thee repose, While turning from life's conflicts, toils, and woes, He looks afar to thy serene abode! Then, strengthened and refreshed, pursues his road, While faith exults and hope with ardour glows; Joyful he hastens on, for soon he knows Abundant entrance will be there bestowed! He mourns not that his intervals of rest Are here so short, so broken, and so few; Nor yet, that when he fain would build his nest, A hand unseen yet stirs it up anew; “Jerusalem,” he cries, while here I roam, Be thou my spirit's rest, her only home. [Thou, through whose all-prevailing name] “The name of the Lord is a strong tower.” Thou, through whose all-prevailing name I urge my every plea and claim, The Holy One, the Just! Jesus! Thy name's mysterious power Shall guard me through life's dangerous hour, And be in death my trust. Oh, precious name! my tower of strength, My resting-place, through all the length And toil of life's rough way; When vexed with cares, oppressed with woes, Still, still in Thee I find repose, On Thee my soul I stay. Thou brightest, dearest, holiest name Of Him unchangeably the same, My Hope, my Shield, my All! Be Thou my song, my theme, my boast, Till, with His countless ransomed host, Low at His feet I fall. Thou art the burden of heaven's song, The theme of all the saintly throng Enthroned in realms of light; To thee each golden harp is strung, Thy praise by each sweet voice is sung, With ever new delight. Name above every name be Thou, That to which every knee shall bow, Each human heart shall bless! Jehovah! Jesus! tune each voice In Thee, Thee only to rejoice, “The Lord our righteousness.” HYMN FOR GOOD FRIDAY. “Behold the Man!”—St. John xix., 5. Dost thou complain of sorrow? Look on Him, His “visage marred,” His eye with suffering dim; The load of unknown agony He bore Forced out “great drops of blood” from every pore. Sharest thou His sorrow? Oh, how small a part! For God's rebuke did even break His heart. Dost thou complain of want? Thy Lord, thy Head Was meanly lodged, was coarsely clothed and fed; He hungered and was thirsty, faint with heat; And walked from place to place with weary feet: What couch of rest was His who came to save? A stable first, a cross, and then a grave. Dost thou complain of coldness, slighting, scorn? Look on thy Lord, deserted and forlorn; Who had such right devoted love to expect, Yet met with such unparalleled neglect? E'en in His bitterest grief no friend was given, Denied alike all help from earth and heaven. Dost thou complain of shame and deep disgrace? Look on thy sinless Lord, and hide thy face; Stripped, crowned with thorns, scourged, spit on, set at nought, To trial like a malefactor brought; Then crucified with thieves, in public view, The death of vilest criminals the due! Dost thou complain of that worst evil, sin, And mourn its deep defilement spread within? Lay thy sick soul beneath that cross one hour, The deadly venom loses there its power; A stream flows thence, which wears a crimson glow, Yet makes the spotted soul as white as snow. Dost thou complain of agonizing pain? Behold that cross! Behold it not in vain! View those racked limbs, that torn and bleeding brow! Hark! from that tortured Form what accents flow! Prayer for His murderer's pardon, words of balm, His mother's anguish to console and calm. Dost thou complain because thou soon must die? Look on thy Lord, nor dread the parting sigh; He drank the bitterest portion death e'er gave, And to a bed of rest transformed the grave: In death, in life, in want, pain, guilt, or grief, Look to that cross! There seek and find relief. THE WILD VIOLET. Sweet Spring walked forth, young flowers her pathway traced, Green wreaths with silver buds adorned her hair; The gay road-side bloomed like a garden fair, With primroses and violets interlaced. I plucked a handful, and with eager haste Sought to inhale the violet's perfume rare. Alas! the form, but not the scent, was there— More sheltered bowers its lovelier kindred graced. Is there no moral whispered? Are there found None with the Christian's name, who gaily shine, Resembling plants trained up on holy ground, But, like this flower, who breathe no scent divine? Not on the world's broad road can grow such flowers As piety trains up in her blest bowers. A HYMN ON PRAYER. Oh never can I serve Thee here, My Saviour, as I ought; Without an unbelieving fear, Without a wandering thought. When at Thy mercy seat I kneel, And strive indeed to pray, Then most the power of sin I feel, And Satan's cruel sway. But in that world on which I fix, By faith, my tearful eyes, No sin its hateful taint will mix, To spoil my sacrifice. Nor ever, from the blissful hour I gain that safe retreat, Will any cruel foe have power To drive me from Thy feet. I shall not offer then to Thee A cold, divided heart; All, all Thine own my soul will be, Renewed in every part. Then “without spot” shall I appear, And worship as I ought, Without an unbelieving fear, Without a wandering thought. HYMN FOR THE NEW YEAR. I take my pilgrim staff anew, Life's path, untrodden, to pursue, Thy guiding eye, my Lord, I view; My times are in Thy hand. Throughout the year my heavenly Friend, On Thy blest guidance I depend; From its commencement to its end My times are in Thy hand. Should comfort, health, and peace be mine, Should hours of gladness on me shine, Then let me trace Thy love divine; My times are in Thy hand. But should'st Thou visit me again With langour, sorrow, sickness, pain, Still let this thought my hope sustain, My times are in Thy hand. Thy smile alone makes moments bright, That smile turns darkness into light; This thought will soothe grief's saddest night, My times are in Thy hand. Should those this year be called away Who lent to life its brightest ray, Teach me in that dark hour to say, My times are in Thy hand. A few more days, a few more years,— Oh, then a bright reverse appears, Then I shall no more say with tears, My times are in Thy hand. That hand my steps will gently guide, To the dark brink of Jordan's tide, Then bear me to the heavenward side; My times are in Thy hand. “REJOICING IN HOPE.” And does my parting hour draw nigh, And is the horizon veiled in gloom, Still I look up—and smiling say Soon, soon the Lord will come.” Faint not my soul! though toils and pains Oppress thee now (the captive's doom), Soon thou wilt cast away thy chains, Soon, soon the Lord will come. Let not my eyes with tears be dim, Let joy their upward glance illume; Look up, and watch, and wait for Him— Soon, soon the Lord will come. Soon will that star-paved milky way, Soon will that beauteous azure dome, Glories, ne'er yet conceived, display— Soon, soon the Lord will come. Changed in the twinkling of an eye, Invested with immortal bloom, I shall behold Him throned on high, And sing, “The Lord is come!” One beam from His all-glorious face These mortal garments will consume, Each sinful blemish will efface— Lord Jesus, quickly come! What will it be with Thee to dwell, Thyself my everlasting home! Oh bliss—oh joy ineffable! Lord Jesus, quickly come! TO A DEPARTED FRIEND. My heart is at rest for thee! Thy God, in His boundless love, Hath given thee exceeding abundantly All we ask or think above. My heart is at rest for thee! Thou hast quitted the vale of tears, Thou art gone where the eye can no evil see, Where the heart no evil fears. My heart is at rest for thee! The foe can assail thee no more; Thou art now without spot eternally, The throne of God before. My heart is at rest for thee! Thy mortal pangs were brief; And weighed with a blissful eternity, How short were thy hours of grief! My heart is at rest for thee! Thou hast entered into peace, But oh! where on earth thou wert wont to be, When will sorrow and sighing cease. HYMN. [Oh! my God, look down with pity] Oh! my God, look down with pity, On a traveller opprest, Seeking an abiding city, Finding here no place of rest. Hoping not for peace or union With a world that loves its own, Panting after sweet communion With Thyself, retired alone; Where at peace without, within Nothing may provoke to sin. Oh! my God, my spirit fainteth With life's noon-day toil and heat, For some pasture green it panteth, Some sequestered calm retreat; As the weary hireling waiteth For the welcome evening shade, So, as mortal strength abateth, Longs my soul to be conveyed Where at peace without, within, Nothing may provoke to sin. TO A FRIEND SETTING OUT ON A LONG JOURNEY. May heavenly guides attend thee! May heavenly guards defend thee! May heavenly influence send thee Sweet themes for holy thought! Though shades of night enfold thee, That eye will still behold thee, E'en His who slumbers not! No evil shall befal thee, No enemy appal thee; Bright messengers shall call thee, Throughout the silent night, To share their high communion, Sweet pledge of future union With sainted heirs of light. No human voice may cheer thee, No earthly listener hear thee, But oh! one friend is near thee, The kindest and the best! Whose smile can banish sadness, Whose presence fill with gladness The solitary breast. Thy God will go before thee, And day and night watch o'er thee, And safely soon restore thee To thy loved home in peace; Nor will His care diminish Till life's long journey finish, And toils and dangers cease. NEW YEAR'S EVE. I sate in silence listening To the retreating year; I heard its latest hour take wing— A shrouded Form stood near, Pointing to time's fast narrowing shore, And whispering, “Soon 'twill be no more.” I felt alone and desolate, And all looked dark around; My thoughts were like a heavy weight, Which on my heart seemed bound: I muse on life's ephemeral span, And sighed “O miserable man!” The past, in mournful retrospect, Awoke my griefs and fears; The present no fair colours decked; I viewed it through my tears: Sickness and sorrow, pain and death All closed me round and choked my breath. But then, though faintly, fearfully, I sought the throne of grace; Full oft had light and hope for me Beamed from that hallowed place; My heavy load of thought and care, My sins, my griefs, I took them there. Oh blessed, blessed antidote For every mental woe! Which hushes each distracting thought The human heart can know! At once a heavenly light stole o'er That scene so dark, so sad before! That ocean, dark and shadowy, On which I feared to gaze, Soon, like a golden sunset sea, Shone with a thousand rays; And one appeared its waves to span, “Whose form was like the Son of Man.” He spoke with voice so musical, As quite entranced the ear; “Thy sins,” He said, “I bore them all— “They cannot re-appear; “And earth is clouded o'er for thee, “That thou may'st long to be with Me.” HYMN FOR THE FIRST SUNDAY OF A NEW YEAR. Welcome, sweet day of holy peace! When earth a hallowed spot appears; Its toils and cares and tumults cease, And heavenly sounds delight our ears. Welcome, sweet day of bounteous grace! When from their unseen sources flow Streams which refresh this desert place, And bid the flowers of Eden blow. Welcome, sweet day of boundless love! When, as man communes with his friends, The God of glory from above, His saints to visit condescends. Welcome sweet day of faith divine! When on the precious “Corner Stone,” Simply recumbent, they recline, Fixed and built up on Him alone. Welcome, sweet day of joyful hope! When the winged soul from bondage freed, Can give her boundless wishes scope, And on celestial banquets feed. Welcome sweet day of heart-felt praise! When mingling with immortal choirs, We blend with theirs our grateful lays, To Him whose love their harps inspires. Welcome, sweet day of fervent prayers! When our High Priest His word fulfils; Our names upon His breastplate bears, For us His golden censer fills. Thrice welcome, day of converse sweet! For those whose hearts breathe love to Him; While all His goodness they repeat, Bright glows the flame earth's vapours dim. Sweet Sabbath! first fruits of the year! Its opening bud, its dawning ray! Be thou its type, its emblem dear; Be its whole course one Sabbath day! TO A YOUNG CHRISTIAN. Heaven speed thee, young voyager! Launch from the shore! Set sale for a country more fair! But take for thy motto, till dangers be o'er, “Be sober and watch unto prayer.” Heaven speed thee! the breeze of the morning awakes; Spread the sails! and improve it with care! He prospers, the flow at its spring-tide who takes; But “be sober and watch unto prayer.” Linger not to look back on the scenes left behind; Cut the cable! the wind is now fair: Beyond those blue waves brighter shores thou wilt find, Then “be sober and watch unto prayer.” Relax not thy vigilance e'en for an hour! For toil, for exertion prepare! One is near, who will lend thee both courage and power, But “be sober and watch unto prayer.” Storms, breakers, and currents may meet thee 'ere long; Still fear not! Look out and beware! Heaven speed thee, young voyager! hope and be strong! “Be sober and watch unto prayer.” A VISION OF DEATH. A stranger in that home I saw, Whose aspect filled my soul with dread; I marked his steps with wondering awe, So strangely noiseless was his tread. He pass'd—and to the chamber went Of her to every heart most dear; Ere they could baffle his intent, With stealthy step he entered there But one beside her couch was found, Whose form was “like the Son of God!” A veiled effulgence shone around That chamber—His beloved abode. On that stern guest He looked and smiled; When lo! a wondrous change took place! His features grew benignly mild, 'Twas even like an angel's face! As in a dream a voice I heard, In music on my ear it broke; Familiar seemed each sacred word, As thus those holiest accents spoke:— “Father! I will that now, in heaven, “She shall be with me where I am; “Thine was she—Thou to Me hast given, “And I have kept her in Thy name.” I heard no more, save one short sigh! It breathed of peace and not of pain; And then the vision was gone by! I longed to witness it again. [Where is happiness, oh where?] “Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.” Prov. iii., 17. Where is happiness, oh where? Breathes she not the mountain air, Where the wild thyme scents the breeze, And enchanting prospects please? No, oh no! Bending low, In a tranquil spot withdrawn, Greeting thus the golden dawn: There I caught her radiant smile, There she tarried for awhile. Treads she not the classic halls, Where the light of science falls On the lore of years gone by, Solving truth's deep mystery? No, oh no! Whispering low In a chamber small, but neat, Soothing pain with comfort sweet; There I caught her radiant smile, There she tarried for awhile. Seeks she not the banquet bright, Splendid rooms, lit up at night; Gay with mirth and music sweet, And the merry dancer's feet? No, oh no! Soft and slow Reading words of truth divine, Pondering o'er each sacred line; There I caught her radiant smile, There she tarried for awhile. Seeks she ne'er the crowded mart, There to take a busy part In the schemes of high emprise, Which to fame and affluence rise? No, oh no! Here below She but seeks one jewel rare, One rich pearl absorbs her care; When she finds it, mark her smile! Heaven seems opening the while! Shuns she then the joys of earth? Dreads she cheerfulness and mirth? She is called “a serious thing;” Glooms and shadows does she bring? No, oh no! Brightly glow On her garments, on her brow, Lovelier hues than earth can show; But from heaven is caught her smile, Here she visits for awhile. [Once a bright illustrious stranger] “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.” Phil. ii., 5. Once a bright illustrious stranger Sojourned in our world below; Menaced all the while with danger, Conversant with scenes of woe: On what errand did He come, Making such a world His home? Seated on His throne of glory, In the high and holy place, He revolved the appalling story Of our ruin, and disgrace; Then with godlike power and love, Stooped to save us from above. Sought He, 'midst His fair creation, Scenes to charm the eye and taste? Labour, suffering, scorn, privation, Formed His lot, from first to last; Oft foregoing rest and food, Life He spent in doing good. Though so high, He prized the lowly, These He loved, selected, taught; Though so perfect, God most holy, Sinners He received and sought— Yea, so low did He descend, He was styled “the sinner's friend.” Love unspeakable inspired Him Man's salvation to complete; Self-consuming ardour fired Him All Jehovah's will to meet; That He might be glorified, 'Twas for this He lived and died. What to Him were scenes of beauty All the world calls good or fair? Following the high call of duty— This sole thought absorbed His care. Man to heal, convert, and save, His own blood for this He gave. Christian! is the life thou'rt leading, To thy Saviour's life conformed? In His footprints art thou treading? Is His mind within thee formed? Love like Him the souls He bought, Seek God's glory, as He sought. THE MIND IS ITS OWN PLACE. Oft I forget the low routine Of outward things, While to an undiscovered scene Thought fondly clings; E'en to that world within, revealed By heavenly light; Whose forms and beauties are concealed From human sight. It was a fearful chaos once; A “dark domain!” “Let there be light,” did God pronounce, And not in vain. Then by a strange and gradual power, All was transformed! A new creation, hour by hour, In silence formed! Order and beauty were disclosed; “Still waters” there; Till peacefully the eye reposed On landscapes fair. Bright in the verdure of their birth, Sparkling with dew, Sweet plants sprang up, yet not of earth, And fragrance threw. Now, when with life's rough path-way worn, Fatigued, opprest, Thither by thought my steps are borne; There I find rest. I mark a culture all divine, With wondrous power, Forming, where briers were wont to twine, A lovely bower. And sometimes in the calm of even I catch a sound, As though some visitant from heaven Breathed music round. A Fragment. A SUMMER EVENING SKETCH BY THE SEASIDE. Radiant and fair smiled ocean, sky, and strand; Only to live, and gaze on them, seemed bliss! The rippling silver waves stole on to kiss, As if in sport, the smooth and glittering sand; Soft blew the southern breezes, freshening, bland; While in the west, sheeting with gold th' abyss, The sunset shewed a lovelier world than this, And tipt each sail, like skiffs from fairy land. A fulness of delight my soul o'erpowered— And, while with thrilling ecstacy I gazed, Methought, if o'er this earth such charms are showered, O to what heights of rapture will be raised Each spirit destined for that pure abode, Where, throned in glory, dwells the Triune God! A SIMILE. Once on a cloudy, wintry day, I marked a beauteous, golden ray On the waves' rippling surface play, As swift it glided on; The cold grey water changed its hue; O'er it the sun his mantle threw; Its gentle course more radiant grew, A track of light it shone. Sun of my soul! my life would be Like that cold wave, untouched by Thee! Thus shine 'midst wintry gloom on me, Thus make my darkness light; Moving with calm yet lustrous force, Though winds and storms swell wild and hoarse, Make Thou my onward, heaven-lit course Still to the end more bright! FRAGMENT, FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POEM, “ON THE FEAR OF DEATH.” Is it not so, Miranda? Do not gleams Of opening glory cheer the dying saint? And as his cumbrous bonds of clay fall off, Does not his soul, set free, exert new powers? It must be so, my sister. I have heard Of one departing saint, in days of yore— His name Rivetus—on whose dying brow A visible glory rested; so that those, The reverend elders gathered round his bed, Exclaimed with wonder and adoring awe, “The beatific vision he beholds!” And though the power of speech had well nigh failed, “I do,” he said distinctly; shewing thus That what they uttered was indeed the truth, And that he then beheld the face of God. Have you not witnessed aught resembling this? Methought, Miranda, you once spoke of one, A gentle girl, who early fell asleep, On whose young features death had set his seal; But who, when speech had failed, and she for days Had scarcely given a sign of consciousness, Just ere the soul took wing for its bright home, Unclosed her full dark eyes, lit up with joy, And heavenward raised, as if in rapture fixed On glorious visions to her sight revealed; Then, sweetly smiling, with “a quiet sigh,” She fell asleep on her Redeemer's breast. 'Twas even so, my sister; and that smile Filled us with comfort, amidst all our grief: That dying chamber seemed the gate of heaven, And its pure light dispelled the gloom of death. But still more deeply treasured in my heart Is the sweet memory of an aged saint; Who, like a shock of corn when fully ripe, Lovely, mature, in every grace complete, Was, not long since, in the heavenly garner stored. Her dying room, her “bed of languishing,” Formed an arena where the power of grace Shone out triumphantly amidst decay. “The faith and patience of the saints;” a love That yet abounded more and more, Breathing out tenderest blessings on us all, Unchilled unchecked e'en by severest pain; And above all, such genuine lowliness, As deemed herself “less than the least of saints.” These heavenly jewels made her light to shine “Brighter and brighter to the perfect day.” Slowly she passed along the shadowy vale, Yet with a faith unfaltering midst its gloom She leant on her Belovèd, and His voice Oft whispered, “It is I—be not afraid!” At last, with a sweet smile of wondering joy, She breathed her Saviour's name, and fell asleep. Surely, Miranda, these are cordials given To cure our dread of death, and make us long for heaven! SONNET. [Oh! there are some who, while on earth they dwell] “Your life is hid with Christ in God.”—Col. iii. 3. Oh! there are some who, while on earth they dwell, And seem to differ little from the throng, Already to the heavenly choir belong, And even here the same sweet anthem swell: They joy, at times, with “joy unspeakable,” Pouring to Him they love their heartfelt song; While to behold Him “face to face” they long, As the parched traveller for the cooling well. Ask you how such from others may be known? Mark those whose look is calm, their brow serene, Gentle their words, love breathing in each tone, Scattering rich blessings all around unseen. They draw each hour, from living founts above, The streams they pour around, of peace, and joy, and love. THE VOYAGE OF LIFE. I see a vast and boundless ocean, On which unnumbered vessels sail; Forward they steer, with rapid motion, Driven by a strong, resistless gale. All reach one port—some late, some early; A port ne'er visited before: Few, few can enter it securely, And many sink to rise no more. Silence and darkness there are posted To veil a gulf of depth unknown; No bark returns that once has crossed it, And each must enter it alone. And there is oft a mighty swelling In those dark waves, so deep and cold; In which (no human skill availing) Sinks many a bark unseen, untold. But ne'er would such a fate betide them Had they not slighted and contemned A heavenly lamp, hung out to guide them O'er each rough billow to the end. This radiant star is never shrouded; 'Mid the fierce storm it smiles serene: By night it looketh out unclouded, And in the day may still be seen. I find myself upon this ocean, And rapidly my bark moves on; Nor know I yet how soon its motion May bring me to that port unknown. I've seen some sister vessels guided Safe into port by that bright star; O'er them benignly it presided, Till peacefully they landed there. Celestial star! whose hallowed radiance Conducted them o'er life's rough sea, I trust to thy propitious guidance; Like them, I fix my eye on thee. Let thy bright beams be shed around me, Then shall my voyage prosper well; Nor e'en that last dread gulf confound me, Though unknown foes my bark assail. Happy the mariner who reaches Soonest that land of heavenly rest; His eye in raptured vision stretches O'er the fair country of the blest. And then, angelic harps, to greet him, Send forth their chorals from on high; And shining forms come out to meet him, And bid him welcome to the sky. The crazy bark, the stormy ocean, To these he bids a long farewell; And sings with rapturous emotion, “I've reached the haven! all is well!” [Tell me not that the valley is dark] “But he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into Heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God.”—Acts vii., 55, 56. Tell me not that the valley is dark, The vale of the shadow of death, When extinguished shall be life's last glimmering spark, And resigned the last labouring breath; Can the path to Heaven's glory be other than bright? I shall see the Lord Jesus—and all will be light. Tell me not that the stream I must ford Is perilous, stormy, and deep; That the waters are out, and that death will afford No lamp down the slippery steep. That shelving descent may spectators affright, I shall see the Lord Jesus—and all will be light. Tell me not that the soul is distrest When dismissed from her mortal abode; Oh no! as the bird hastens home to its nest She will fly to the bosom of God. His smile will be on her—the path will be bright, She will see the Lord Jesus—and all will be light. I have heard, even lately, of one Who that vale and those waters passed through, He was not left in darkness, was not left alone, In the passage heaven oped to his view; Those who loved him are left in the shadow of night, He beheld the Lord Jesus—to him all was light. THOUGHTS ON A DEPARTED FRIEND. Yes, she was very lovely; soft, serene; A heavenly impress rested on her brow; Methinks I view her sweet pale features now, As on her sister's arm she loved to lean; While in her whole demeanour, there were seen Meek resignation, love's seraphic glow, And faith, which, when earth's hopes were all laid low, Could look, rejoicing, to a happier scene. Blessed is thy sweet memory, much loved saint, Precious to all who shared thy converse here; As the pure gold, when purged from dross and taint! Shows the Refiner's likeness, mirror'd clear, So (from the furnace coming forth) in thee, 'Twas ours, thy Lord's reflected traits to see. [O Thou, the hope, the strength of Israel] “Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.”—Psalm lxi., 2. O Thou, the hope, the strength of Israel, Their hiding-place, in which secure they dwell, The rock round which the billows vainly chafe, While hidden in its clefts, Thine own are safe. Lo! tempest-tossed, bewildered, weary, weak, That blessed hiding-place, my God, I seek. I see the swelling tide advancing still! A thousand fears my trembling bosom fill; I stretch my hands, I lift my feeble cries; On that safe spot, I fix my straining eyes; O now let mercy's arm, with power divine, Place me upon that rock, and take me in! I see no other rock—no safe retreat— Roughly the waves and storms around me beat— A shipwrecked, houseless mariner I roam; Earth has for me no resting-place, no home; O sheltering rock! let me but safely hide Within Thy clefts, I ask no boon beside! Once sheltered there, for ever safe from fear, The gathering storms I, undismayed, shall hear; Once sheltered there, how will my heart rejoice Beneath its shadow, listening to that voice, Whose heavenly accents bid all trouble cease, Control the winds and waves, and whisper peace. I cast no “longing, lingering look behind;” On life's rough ocean no repose I find; I see it strewed with many a fearful wreck, And many a gallant bark I vainly seek, Which, had they sought the rock, when tempesttossed, Would ne'er, 'mid shoals and quicksands, have been lost. Here will I watch and wait, and “wish for day,” O Rock of Ages! at Thy foot I stay! Let not the dashing waves unclasp my hold! Let mercy's arms my trembling form enfold, And place me where “Thy hidden ones” repose, Till the new earth and heaven their charms disclose. 2 TIMOTHY III., 1. My God! “the perilous times” foretold, Are come, alas! in this our day; “The love of many does wax cold,” Many from Thee do fall away! And Thy pure word is set aside— Man's only safe, unerring guide. The light of science grows more bright, New fields of knowledge are explored; But heavenly truth's refulgent light Is so rejected or ignored, That few hold on their steadfast way, Turning from all false lights away. That finished work, that glorious plan, By Christ, for our salvation, wrought, By erring and presumptuous man Is deemed superfluous—set at nought! While human systems are believed, Man's doctrine as the truth received. Thy pure commandments, just, divine, Which it is “great reward” to keep, Men boldly break, while sloth supine, Or sceptic doubts lull souls to sleep; And, though Thy mercies never cease, Our sins, our daring sins increase. Thou markest those who “sigh and cry” For these our nation's sins, O Lord! Look down, look down with pitying eye! More of Thy quickening grace accord! Stir up Thy power, stretch forth Thine hand, Revive Thy work in this our land! We know that nations rise or fall As Thy pure truth thrives or decays; That truth shall triumph over all; O! hasten then those glorious days, When Thou wilt claim Thy dear-bought throne, And make this ransomed world Thine own. HYMN ON EASTER EVE. Holy Slumberer, rest in peace! Now Thy toils and conflicts cease; Now the glorious victory won, Death and Satan overthrown, Soon will burst the exulting strain, “Worthy is the Lamb once slain!” We are watching round Thy tomb; Angel wings flit through the gloom, And the blissful morn draws nigh When, through earth, and air, and sky, Shall the wondrous news be spread— “Christ is risen from the dead!” Happy those who saw Thee then; “Fairer than the sons of men;” Happy those to whom 'twas given To behold Thee rise to heaven! We a blessing, too, receive, “Who, not having seen, believe.” Saviour of once ruined man! Sealed is the stupendous plan: On its bright, triumphant close Firmly all our hopes repose. Oh! to feel each day, each hour, More Thy resurrection's power. “LET ME GO: FOR THE DAY BREAKETH.” Repeated by a dying Saint, which suggested the following lines. Let me go: for the day now breaketh, Let me go where the heart ne'er acheth,— Where not one the cup of woe partaketh, But the weary are at rest. Let me go where the strength ne'er faileth, Where the blighting curse no more prevaileth, Where the serpent's sting no more assaileth, Where nor foe nor fear molest. Let me go: for my spirit fainteth, To dwell in that world no evil tainteth, To look on the vision no pencil painteth, Which no mortal eye hath seen. Let me go: for my heart is weary, Around me the wintry gloom is dreary, But the summer in heaven is bright and cheery, And the deep blue sky serene. Let me go: for the best and dearest, The treasures who once to my heart were nearest,— Whose love was the fondest, best, sincerest, They are all gone before. I feel upon earth a lonely stranger, Compassed with sorrow and care and danger, Amid wastes and wilds a trembling ranger: Let me go to a fairer shore. Let me go. The glad word is spoken— The golden bowl at the fount is broken; Loosed is the silver cord, in token That my task is done below. Let me go—to the God who sought me, To the Saviour whose precious blood hath bought me, To the heavenly Guide who hath cleansed and taught me, Oh, let me, let me go! SONG OF THE PARTING SPIRIT. I have washed my robes, I have made them white, I have put on the wedding garment bright; I have bidden farewell to my earthly home, I wait but the summons—the Bridegroom is come. I have bidden farewell to temptation and pain, No tear will ere fall from my eyelids again; My warfare is ended and glory draws near, I wait but the voice of the Bridegroom to hear. But who may the day of His coming abide, When He comes in His glory to welcome His bride? Can a worm of the earth, can a creature like me, Be wedded, Thou great King of Glory, to Thee? Yes! Thou hast betrothed me, hast made me fair, Thine own are the robes and the jewels I wear; Thou hast raised me up from my low estate, Ennobled, enriched me, and made me great. And Thee will I glorify, Thee will I praise, I soon shall behold Thy celestial rays; Shall wake up in Thy likeness, be placed by Thy side, And then, not till then, shall be satisfied. FANCY PIECES, WRITTEN IN EARLIER YEARS. AN ALLEGORY. (Written many years ago, when health failed.) It is not known that I am married, But yet, I have a spouse; Long I refused, resisted, tarried: At length I paid my vows. Mine is no fashionable lord, For months and weeks away. He seldom, during all the year, Is absent for a day. And (which is more) few married dames Can better lessons learn Than he imparts, when, duteously, A willing ear I turn. We'er not well suited, I confess, For he is grave and mild; And I am full of levity, And passionate and wild. But, since my marriage, I have been Much meeker than I was; And, if improvement may be seen, His influence is the cause. I sit for hours with him alone Without impatience now; And view, without dislike or fear, His melancholy brow. The maxims I once thought so harsh, The rules so strict and sad, I value now, because I see 'Twas needful such were made. O'er the dark views of life he gives I shed no murmering tear, Tho' scarcely one bright tint is seen, The traveller's heart to cheer. But, while he wraps the world below In dreariness and gloom, What heavenly lustre does he throw Upon the world to come! Such glories does he oft unfold, Such scenes of bliss portray, That e'en my earthbound soul would fain Take wing, and flee away. Had I but known at first what years Of intercourse have taught, His worth had gained for him, at once, The unwilling hand he sought. But, when he wooed me, I exclaimed, “If I become your wife “You'll never know one happy hour, “One interval from strife. “I am so foolish—you so wise, “We never can agree; “You are so gloomy—I so gay, “Your look's enough for me. “The things that please and suit me best “You would at once forbid, “And shackle me with tiresome rules “In all I said or did. “I warn you to reflect and pause; “Beware of what you do! “I like my character too well “To alter it for you. “Though higher powers, if you persist, “Command my sad assent, “The consequence that will ensue— “My death—they can't prevent.” He mildly answered, “Let me try “The influence of time. “How oft have sorrowing lovers found “A faithful friend in him! “I am forbidding; strangers oft “Receive me with a frown: “But I am welcomed with a smile “Where I am fully known. “Besides, I have a plea to urge “None ever urged before; For your advantage, not for mine, “This union I implore. “For your own sake reject me not; “Let but your friend be tried; “A kind protector he will prove, “A counsellor and guide.” And, really, he has kept his word; For, ever since our marriage, Of all his promises and claims Not one can I disparage. He shelters me from many a snare, His counsel ne'er deceives me; And, tho' he makes me stay at home, He very seldom leaves me. He's fond of reading, so am I; We read for hours together. And, if our sun be seldom bright, We've calm and tranquil weather. And, on the whole, since many a wife Her marriage has repented, I'll think my lot as good as most, And learn to be contented. THE MANIAC'S SONG. My heart is lost! I know not where, 'Twas lost before they brought me here; And he, to his dark grave is gone, Who might have called that heart his own. Now, none within my bosom dwells; Nothing that aches, or thinks, or feels; All is so cold, so silent there— Hope flew away, and sent despair. Lady! I'll give thee this bright ring, If thou again my heart wilt bring. The fire of joy no more will burn, Yet still I prize its funeral urn. Then go and seek it in the place Where the last tear bedewed my face. 'Twas on my lover's lowly bed— There soon I'll rest my weary head. Oh! Lady—I would fain declare, With what that heart might once compare; If I could weep, my tears would flow, So strangely is it altered now. It was a garden, once, where grew Roses, and flowers of every hue; They bloomed while Hope their beauty cherished, But she forsook them, and they perished. 'Twas like a landscape viewed at dawning, Bright with the tints and dews of morning; A sudden storm the scene defaced, And in a moment laid it waste. Oh, once 'twas like a harp of gold, Whose every note of rapture told; Now, murmuring sounds of plaintive woe, Seem from each broken chord to flow. 'Tis like a book, whose earlier page, Pictures a more than golden age; But every sad succeeding leaf, Bears the dark character of grief. Oh, 'twas a lovely bird, whose song, Warbled to cheer me all day long; A cruel sportsman broke its wing, Now it can never fly nor sing. Lady! thou canst not fail to know, A heart so many signs will show,— O, see, by every mournful token, How changed it is—how lost—how broken! It once was buoyant—light as air, It once was happy—free from care; Now seek, but you will find one never, A heart so sad—sad—sad—for ever. A MIDNIGHT EXCURSION; Or, the Question Answered, ‘Why I cannot Sleep at Night.’ Dedicated to all my fellow-sufferers. Oh listen! ye pallid and woe-begone wights, Who sigh all the day o'er your wearisome nights; And, though you desire, and invoke, and implore her, Catch scarcely a glimpse of kind “Nature's Restorer.” Oh listen! and, ere you my history finish, Your wonder, if not your regret, will diminish. But, before I begin, I must candidly state That, unless I had witnessed the facts I relate, I could never myself have believed they were true, And am bound, if you doubt, to be lenient towards you. I will now, without further exordium, recite What happened no longer ago than last night: You must know that the soul can sometimes slip away (Like a bird from its cage) from its cottage of clay; Mine for many nights past had been beating about, Impatiently, restless, in hopes to get out; At length, a kind spirit with beautiful wings Took pity upon me, and loosened the strings Betwixt body and soul, just to give me a flight, Though the body still pulled, like the string of a kite. However, I did get away, as I said, And looked down from the sky on my body in bed. How I longed to lose sight of that dwelling so snug, But alas! the string pulled, and kept twitching, tug! tug! The benevolent spirit exclaimed, with a smile, “You cannot rise higher, as yet; but, meanwhile, “Return to your clay habitation once more. “I will shew you a scene worth your while to explore; “And the glass I will lend shall disclose to your view “Things hidden from spirits embodied like you.” I gently descended, borne up by my guide, Till I found myself placed my own body beside. The eyelids in slumber appeared to be closed, And the head on its plllow unconscious reposed. My winged instructor then gently directed His glass to that head: all at once it reflected An ivory-roofed chamber—large, dazzling, and bright, And crowded with figures, all strange to my sight. “Where am I?—who are they?” astonished, I cried. “You behold the inside of your brain,” said my guide; “And the numerous inmates you wonder to view “Are all your old friends, though their features are new.” “How? that beautiful banquetting-room my own brain? “Can the space of one head that assembly contain? “Kind Spirit! thou surely wouldst never deceive, “But can a mere mortal such marvels believe?” He did not reprove me, but said, with a smile, “Look again on the mirror—keep silence the while.” I obeyed him, and soon all the objects grew clear, While the sound of mixed voices increased on my ear. A banquet was spread, and the mirth it rose high; Four different classes of guests met my eye; But they all were so strangely commingled and jumbled, While around them the little ones frolicked and tumbled, That I could not have made out their names or their nature, If my guide had not given their true nomenclature. (Meantime, my poor body grew restless and groaned; Its eyes were half opened, it started and moaned, And would surely have striven to slumber in vain, But my guide dropped some balsam, and hushed it again. I returned to the glass.) At one end of the table Sat some old, wrinkled men, whose wan lips seemed unable To relax into smiles; their thin backs were all bent, Their brows were contracted with dark discontent. And there they sat fretting, and grumbling, and croaking, And making a noise between groaning and choking; Either dreading the future, or blaming the past, They seemed, in the present, no comfort to taste. “His name on his mantle each visitor bears,” Said my guide. Then I looked, and I read the word, “Cares.” There were many bright figures of various mien, Intermingled among the old men to be seen. Some pensive and silent, some pouring along Their eloquent breathings in rhetoric or song. I looked for their name, and soon found what I sought, On their sleeve was embroidered the epithet “Thought.” As closer I looked, I discerned with delight Some fair female figures; their tresses were bright, Their features were full of expression—some sad Yet lovely, and others bewitching and glad. Some were soothing the old wrinkled men with their smiles, Some charming the others with innocent wiles; Some were fondly caressing a group of young things, With faces like children and bright coloured wings; Some were talking of friendship, some whispering of love; And they looked like fair visitants come from above. I eagerly sought for the letters revealing Their names, and in spangles of silver read, “Feeling.” Then I turned to examine those pretty young creatures, No two dressed alike, or alike in their features. One flew like a lark, and one sang like a linnet; And they changed both their form and their note every minute. One was making a nosegay of daisies and pansies; And engraved on its sash I descried the word “Fancies.” And what with their dancing, and chattering, and glee, And what with the din of the fore-mentioned three, And the blaze of the light, and my own odd position, I soon felt quite willing to seek re-admission Even into my prison-house body, that slept; So, with thanks to my guide and his aid, in I crept.— By this midnight excursion I've gained, I acknowledge, One piece of important and practical knowledge. I have frequently wondered before and lamented That my sleep is so often disturbed or prevented; But, now I have seen what goes on in my brain, Methinks I ought never to murmer again; But deem it a marvel, a blessing, a boon, If I catch but one wink between midnight and noon. For, since all these good folks above stairs never tire Of talking, or sporting, or venting their ire; Since Cares will be carking, and fearing, and fussing; And Thoughts will be arguing, planning, discussing; And Feelings find something to joy or to sigh at; And Fancies one moment can never keep quiet; While my brain must afford them both lodging and diet, 'Twould be folly to look for one night's peaceful rest, Till these, who sleep never, shall be dispossessed. A VISIT TO SATURN. These verses describe the tragical event which befel a gentleman of our acquaintance, in consequence of having made the following declaration in the presence of four ladies:—“No woman ever has had, or ever shall have any influence over me.” My mind has been lately revolving a scheme, Which shall soon be accomplished, tho' strange it may seem; The queen of the fairies is one of my friends, Her aid has been promised to compass my ends, So that soon my resentment will fall, with full weight, On the little white cottage that stands by the gate. For thus has the queen of the fairies declared, Our female prerogative zealous to guard,— “The influence, attractions, and virtues of woman “Shall be with impunity slighted by no man.” This causes that gentleman's singular fate, Who lives in the cottage just close to our gate. He will see, all at once, as he sits by the fire, The desk and the table rise higher and higher; He will find himself, also, by gentle degrees Ascending together with them at his ease; Nor, when he looks out, will his wonder abate, For the cottage no longer stands near to the gate. And then he will hastily call Mrs. Haines, His Landlady. Afraid some disorder bewilders his brains. Alas! to his grief and surprise he will find The poor widow is fairly gone out of her mind; And not long can survive the mysterious fate Of her pretty white cottage that stood by the gate. And thus, finding thought and enquiry vain, He will calmly sit down to his studies again. But the fairies, who love to keep mortals in awe, Provoked at this strange philosophic sang-froid, Resolve to proceed at a speedier rate, In removing the cottage away from the gate. And now all the books, in such order before, Are scattered pell-mell on the sofa and floor; The half-written sermon leaps off from the table. No more is the studious philosopher able, In mental abstraction, collected, sedate, To muse in the cottage that was by the gate. He changes, tho' not without hazard, his place; And then, from the window endeavours to trace What he fancies an earthquake, which strikes him the more, Having rarely been known in this island before. But beneath him, no object has altered its state, None—none but the cottage that stood by the gate. The church and the village lie tranquil below, The trees and the houses are in statu quô; The more he considers, the less he can fancy By what interference, or strange necromancy, Convulsion of nature, or malice of fate, The cottage is thus borne away from the gate. That church and that village at length disappear, Its chime or its hum ne'er again will he hear; The Dewers, and Allnuts, and Elliotts no more Will pass by the window, or rap at the door; Misses Broadhurst, Wolff, Puckle, or Thornton, in state, Be seen from the cottage, or heard at the gate. For now, the vast regions of space having past, His destined abode he discovers at last— The planet of Saturn, The dull leaden hue of this planet is supposed to be owing to the absence of women. where woman's sweet smile No joy will enliven, no sorrow beguile: Where she ne'er will approach him, to soften his fate, Or to grace the white cottage that was by the gate. He will never again be permitted to hear A sweet female accent fall soft on his ear. In sorrow and sickness, in languor and pain, No mother, no sister shall soothe him again. By their loss he will learn their full value, too late, And wish the white cottage once more by the gate. But in Saturn society still he will find, Much more than at Clapham, and more to his mind; For men of all ages and tastes there will be, Scientific and studious, and learned as he; And able more justly his talents to rate, Than his unlearned neighbours who lived by the gate. Mineralogists, chemists, geologists there Examine the earth, fire, water, and air; And, by female solicitude never annoyed, Are, from morning to night, in their studies employed. With them he may prosecute, early and late, What he could but begin, when he lived by the gate. 'Tis a charming abode for astronomers, too; The ring is so splendid—the objects so new; From thence, twinkling afar, may be sometimes descried Our own little planet, where women reside. On that, thro' his telescope, often and late, Will he gaze from the cottage that was by the gate. For the intellect cannot at all times aspire; Mathematics will weary, theology tire. He will sigh, as the dreary long evenings appear, For the gay and the graceful, who used to be near; But no more will their wit or their kindness elate; No more will the cottage return to the gate. Tho' in Saturn the graces and loves are unknown, They contrive to be gay in a mode of their own; And the rest, who have never resided on earth, Can contentedly share the inelegant mirth; But he leaves them disgusted, regretting, too late, The friends he once knew when he lived by the gate. And still, as the slow creeping months wear away, And monotony darkens and lengthens each day, Deprived of what once such a solace could prove— A mother's, a sister's affectionate love— His heart sinks within him, subdued by the fate That bore him for ever away from the gate. “How weary,” he cries, “and how sick have I grown “Of minds and of manners resembling my own! “Oh! where's the bright glance and the welcoming smile, “That used to refresh, and enchant, and beguile? “Oh, pleasures regretted and valued too late! “When, when shall the cottage revisit the gate? “Ah! why did I never appreciate their worth, “When they all were within my own reach upon earth? “How might they have softened, improved, and refined “My negligent manners, my saturnine mind! “Alas! tho' severe, 'twas a merited fate, “That bore me so strangely away from the gate! And there we must leave him, too late to deplore The friends and the blessings he slighted before. To the queen of the fairies our thanks must be paid, For granting such prompt and effectual aid; And to all men we hold out in warning the fate Of the little white cottage that stood by the gate. LEAMINGTON PERIPATETICS; OR, USE YOUR LIMBS, AND HAVE THEM. Scene.—Union Parade. Stranger meeting a Patient. Stranger. I hear, Sir, your Warwickshire far-famed Physician, Who seems to cure all, whatsoe'er their condition, Has revived the old school of Athenian Ethics, Or, at least, its old name of the Peripatetics. Pray, is it not true, with child, woman, and man, He makes “Walking” a sine quâ non in his plan? Patient. He does, Sir, so much so, that some have the notion The secret is his, of perpetual motion; For all the disciples who bow to his sway Walk out in all seasons, all hours of the day. They walk when the north wind blows piercing and bleak, They walk when their mouths are so stiff they can't speak; They walk in the mists and cold fogs of November, They walk in the drizzle and damp of December; They walk when it thaws, and they walk when it freezes, They walk for all causes, to cure all diseases! They walk when they have not a limb that is sound, They walk when they cannot set foot to the ground; They walk when their poor backs are ready to break, They walk though each bone in their bodies may ache; They walk when they're fasting, they walk when they've eaten, They walk when so weary they'd rather be beaten! They walk when they're peevish, they walk when they're placid; They walk when they're pinched by the “Sulphuric acid.” They walk after faintings, hysterics, and fits, They walk in their senses, and out of their wits; They walk if they're commoners, walk if they're peers, They walk whether young, middle-aged, or in years; Epileptic, dyspeptic, neuralgic, what not, No matter what ails them, all set off full trot. Be they gentle or simple, plebeian or noble, All walk—or, if gouty, at least they all hobble. The plethoric walk, in the hope to grow paler; The pallid ones walk, to grow stronger and haler. The stout and unwieldy, they're walking for that; The bony and skinny, they walk to grow fat. If some walk too slowly, they're joined by “the Master;” Then, surprising to see, they walk faster and faster. At other times body or mind make resistance, But with him they can walk any pace—any distance. In short, he makes those walk who ne'er walked before; And those who have always walked here walk still more. 'Tis rumoured Jephsonian-trained infants are able To walk the first month: but this must be a fable. However, we soon, perhaps, shall see without wonder Small babies, all walking at six months and under! Lilliputian pedestrians, standing quite strong; Tiny Peripatetics, not yet two feet long. For, who knows what strange marvels may meet our inspection, When “Walking,” like steam, shall be brought to perfection; Which it must be in Leamington, where, without strife, “Walking” forms the chief end, the main business of life. Inscribed, very mirthfully, to “the Master.” THE LADY AND THE MOUSE. A True Story. I think little Emmy will read with delight An amusing rencontre that happened last night, Betwixt a fair lady, all trembling and pale, And a plump little foe with a very long tail. Our heroine of course, must be lovely and fair, Or else quite unlike what all heroines are; And to make her the fitter to figure in song, She must have a feigned name of some syllables long. And now, in due form, here commences my story: Fair Luna, resplendent, was shining in glory, The clock had struck twelve and the household reposed, All eyes but Eudocia's in slumber were closed— She had long been accustomed sad vigils to keep, For you know 'tis so vulgar, so common to sleep. All pensive and tearful she thought of her woes, Or of some other subject, which nobody knows; Or, perhaps she was thinking of friends far away, Or composing some lines on Diana's soft ray. In the midst of her musings she suddenly heard A noise very near her of something that stirred, She felt her poor heart beating fast, pit-a-pat, For she feared from the sound that it might be a bat, And to bats (tho' I own 'twas a weakness and error,) She felt an aversion amounting to terror. She presently heard something jump from the bed, And slowly, and cautiously, lifting her head, She plainly perceived, on the toilet just by Some creature, but what, 'twas too dark to descry; But he made very free with the combs and the papers, And, as he seemed likely to cut a few capers, Eudocia thought fit to call help to her aid Lest his next leap should place him once more on the bed. Her little white feet, without stocking or shoe, Bore her swiftly upstairs, lest the foe should pursue; She wakened her maidens, and told them her plight, They haste to her chamber, each bearing a light. They search every corner—examine the bed, Alas! it avails not, the culprit has fled! Eudocia at length sent them back to their rest, And hoped she was freed from her troublesome guest; But scarce were the lights and the maidens withdrawn, And the fair one in darkness laid watching forlorn, Before she felt something run over her feet; Away went the counterpane—off flew the sheet! Again she heard something fall down, as before, Like a bird, or a mouse, or a bat, on the floor. The maidens were listening, and came at her call, And they just caught a glimpse of a tail near the wall; They thought it too large for a mouse, but a bat They believed had no tail, so it might be a rat! Eudocia half laughing, half wearied, reclined, In the hope while they caught it, some quiet to find, But all in a moment she sprang from the bed, Exclaiming—“Its here, it was nibbling my head!” And there, sure enough, by them both it was seen, Just making her pillow its refuge and screen. But vain were all efforts to follow and watch it, And vainly they strove to imprison and catch it. The Lady relinquished both chamber and bed And left Mr. Mouse to enjoy them instead. It was past one o'clock ere the fair one could creep To the cold bed where mousey compelled her to sleep; But she bore her hard fate with a very good grace, And patience and cheerfulness smiled in her face; She thought of long nights in the summers gone by, When no mouse had intruded, or forced her to fly, And quite wearied out, by the toils of the day, She at length fell asleep, in the common-place way. In the morning, the poor little culprit was caught, And atoned with his life for the mischief he wrought, And Eudocia was grieved, when she woke, to be told Of the fate he had suffered for being too bold. THE CAPTIVE BIRD. Written in London. Addressed to a Friend in Sickness. I heard a bird singing, whose notes were so sweet That I sought to discover its tuneful retreat; And I found that a cage hanging near was the cell Whence the melody flowed, that had pleased me so well. I looked at the songster: his feathers of gold A tale of misfortune and banishment told; The orient tint of that plumage so bright Belonged to some island of splendour and light. Then I thought on the palm-groves, the myrtles, the vines, Where the stream ever sparkles, the sun ever shines, Where the plaintain's broad leaves their rich verdure display, And the cocoa-nut tufts glitter bright in his ray. I imagined the charms of those tropical skies, Where the night with the day in magnificence vies; Where unknown constellations so vividly glow, While the fire-fly emits its wild flashes below. I pictured the colours, far brighter than our's, Which adorn the gay insects, the birds, and the flowers; And methought this poor captive, those beauties among First waked to existence, first warbled his song. 'Mid the deep shady groves he delighted to sing, On the orange, the tulip tree, rested his wing; Or soared with bright songsters the morning to hail, Where no mists the cerulean firmament veil. Poor chorister! sadly thy lot has been changed, From climate, and home, and companions estranged; Immured in a city, forbid to take wing; O! what can induce thee so sweetly to sing? Not a tree nor fair blossom refreshes thy sight, The dark, gloomy buildings obscure the sun's light: Each sound is discordant around thee; and yet Thou canst sing, e'en as if thou hadst nought to regret. Wouldst thou teach me the lesson, that man may be blest, E'en with loneliness, bondage, privation, oppressed, If he thankfully cherish the comforts still left, Nor grieve for their loss, though of many bereft. There is one who has taught me this lesson before; A native, like thee, of a lovelier shore. She, too, is a prisoner, sad and alone; And her song, thou sweet bird, more than rivals thine own. Thou wilt die in thy bondage, poor bird: not for thee Remains there a hope thy bright country to see. But she will be borne to her blest native shore, And never feel pain or captivity more. A TRUE STORY. Love came to me not long ago, With rosy garlands crowned, Health, youth and beauty graced his brow, And fragrance breathed around. “Sweet boy,” I cried, “thou'rt welcome here,” And clasped him in my arms; And held him there without a fear, Admiring all his charms. Then, with a smile, a rose he drew From those that decked his brow, “I've cut off all its thorns for you,” He said, “so take it now.” And then he asked with me to dwell, I gladly gave consent, He said, “his nurse would come as well,” If he to seek her went.” “And what may be her name?” I said. “Oh! know you not?” he cried. “Sweet Hope, who rocked my cradle-bed, “And my first food supplied. “She gently wipes away my tears, “When sorrow fills my breast; “And, if 'tis e'er disturbed by fears, “She hushes them to rest. “I could not live without her care; “She brings my daily food, “And trains the lovely flowers I wear, “From their first opening bud. “But let me go and seek her now, “That you may love her too!” Then, like an arrow from his bow, Away the charmer flew. All bathed in tears he soon returned, Pale was his altered cheek; And, when I asked him why he mourned, He strove in vain to speak. At length he said, “I never thought “My nurse would change so soon; “She used to grant me all I sought, “However large the boon. “But now she says, if I prefer “Henceforth to live with you, “I must for ever part from her, “And choose between the two. “And this it is that breaks my heart; “Oh help me to decide! “I cannot bear with you to part, “Or her—my earliest guide.” “And why,” I asked, “does Hope refuse “With thee and me to dwell? “Why must I be compelled to lose “Guests I should love so well? “But now at once the cause I see, “And own it must be so; “For Disappointment dwells with me— “Thine and thy nurse's foe. “So now farewell, dear lovely boy! “And let us both forget “The sweet, but transitory joy, “With which at first we met. “Hope was my early guardian too, “And once reared flowers for me; “And, when my lovely nurse withdrew, “I wept, sweet boy, like thee. “Without her thou canst ne'er be mine, “So, once again, adieu! “I could not bear to see thee pine, “And lose that brilliant hue, “Go, seek the gay, the young, the fair, “By Health and Joy caressed: “Hope will attend thy footsteps there, “An unreluctant guest.” Then, as I clasped him, weeping still, And lovelier than before, I vowed, but wept myself the while, To see his face no more.</field>
