      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST BOOKE OF VIRGIL HIS ÆNEIS. I that in old season wyth reeds oten harmonye whistled My rural sonnet; from forrest flitted (I) forced Thee sulck?g swincker thee soyle, thoghe craggie, to sunder. A labor and a trauaile too plow swayns hertelye welco?. Now m?hod and garbroyls J chaunt, and martial horror. I blaze thee captayne first from Troy cittye repairing, Lyke wandring pilgrim too famosed Italie trudging, And coast of Lauyn: soust wyth tempestuus hurlwynd, On land and sayling, bi Gods predestinat order: But chiefe through Iunoes long fostred deadlye reuengment. Martyred in battayls, ere towne could statelye be buylded, Or Gods theare setled: thence flitted thee Latin of spring, Thee roote of old Alban: thence was Rome peereles inhaunced. My muse shew the reason, what grudge or what furye kendled Of Gods thee Princesse, through so cursd mischeuus hatred, Wyth sharp sundrye perils too tugge so famus a captayne. Such festred rancoure doo Sayncts celestial harbour? A long buylt citty theare stood, Carthago so named, From the mouth of Tybris, from land eke of Jtalye seauerd, Possest wyth Tyrians, in streingh and ritches abounding, Theare Iuno, thee Princes her Empyre wholye reposed, Her Samos owtcasting, heere shee dyd her armonye settle, And warlick chariots, heere chiefly her ioylitye raigned. This towne shee labored too make thee gorgeus empresse, Of towns and regions, her drift yf destenye furthred. But this her hole meaning a southsayd mysterie letted That from thee Troians should branch a lineal ofspring, Which would thee Tyrian turrets quite batter a sunder, And Libye land lykewise wyth warlick victorye conquoure. Thus loa bye continuance thee naues of fortun ar altred. This Iuno fearing, and old broyls bluddye recounting, Vsd by her Greeke fauorits, that Troian cittye repressed, Her rancour canckred shee can not let to remember, And Paris his scorning iudgement dooth burne in her entrayls. Shee pouts, that Ganymed by Ioue too skitop is hoysed. Shee bears that kinred, that sept vnmerciful hatred. Wyth theese coals kendled shee soght al possibil engins In surging billows too touze thee coompanie Troian. Al the frushe and leauings of Greeks, of wrathful Achilles. Through this wyde roaming thee Troians Italy mishing Ful manye yeers wandred, stil crost with destenye backward. Such trauail in planting thee Romans auncetrye claymed. Tward Sicil Isle scantly thee Troian nauye dyd enter, And the sea salte foaming wyth braue flantadoe dyd harrow, When that Iuno Godesse thee fuid most deadlye reuoluing Thus to her self mumbled: shal J leaue my purpose vnaunswerd? Or shal I this Troian too seize thus on Italye suffer? Forsoth I stand lotted by fats: and clarcklye recounted. As thogh that Pallas could not bee fullye reuenged, Thee Greekfleete scorching, thee Greekish coompanye drowning: And for on his faulty practice, for madnes of Aiax? This Queene wyld lightninges from clowds of Iuppiter hurling Downe swasht theyre nauy, thee swelling surges vphaling. Thee pacient panting shee thumpt and launst wyth a fyrebolt, And wythal his carcasse on rockish pinnacle hanged. And shal J then Iuno, of Saincts al thee Princes abyding, Both the wife and sister too peerelesse Juppiter holden, In so great a season wyth one od pild countrey be warring? If this geare cotten, what wight wyl yeelde to myn aulters Bright honor and Sacrifice, wyth rits my person adoring? Thus she frying fretted, thus deepely plunged in anger Æolian kingdoom shee raught; where blusterus huzing Of wynds in Prison thee great king Æolus hampreth. Theese flaws theyre cabbans wyth stur snar iarrye doe ransack, Greedelye desyring too rang:king Æolus, highly Jn castel setled, theyre strief dooth pacifie wisely. But for this managing, a great hurly burlye the wyndblasts Would keepe on al mayne seas and lands wyth woonderus humbling. Thee father almighty this mischiefe warelye doubting Mewd vp theese reuelers coupt in strong dungeon hillish, And a king he placed, throgh whose Maiestical Empyre Theese blasts rouze forward, or back by his regal apoinctment. Too this princelye regent her suit ladie Iuno thus opned. Æolus (in so much as of mankind the Emperor heaunlye And father of thee Gods too thee the auctoritye signed Too swage seas surging, or raise by blusterus huffling) Thee water of Tyrrhen my foes wyth nauye doe trauerse: Troy towne wyth tamd gods too land ek of Jtaly bringing. Yeeld to the wynds passadge, duck downe theire fleete wyth a t?pest, Or ships wyde scatter, wyth fluds that coompanye swallow. Nymphs do I keepe fourteene for peerelesse bewtye renowmed, Of theese thee paragon, for fayrenesse, Deiopeia Too the in fast wedlock wyl I knit, thye wife onlye remayning; Thy pheere most faythful through eendles season abyding, Thee father of fayre brats, for this thy curtesye, making. This labor is needelesse (deere Queene) king Æolus aunsward. Thy mynd to accomplish my bounden duitye requireth. For my mace and kingdoom through thy fast freendship I gayned. Through thy freendlye trauaile mee dooth king Iuppiter algats Tender: by thye labour wyth Gods at bancket J solace. Thow madst me in tempest and blusturs loftelye ruling. This sayd: wyth poyncted flatchet thee mountan he broached Rush do the winds forward through perst chinck narrolye whizling; Thee land turmoyling with blast and terribil huzing. They skud too the seaward, from deepe profunditie raking Too the skye thee surges, the east west contrarie doe struggle And southwind ruffling: on coast thee chauft flud is hurled. Crash do the rent tacklings; thee men raise an horribil owtcrye. Thee clowds snach gloomming from sight of Coompanie Troian Both Light and welken: thee night dooth shaddo the passadge. Thee skyes doo thunder, thee lightnings riflye doe flush flash, Noght breeds theym coomfort, eeche thing mortalitye threatneth. Æneas (his lyms wyth sharp cold chillye benummed) Dooth groane, then to skyward his claspt hands heauelye lifting, Thus spake: O Troians, o thrise most nobil or happye That before eune the parents wyth byckring martial ended Your liues at townewals: of Greekes ô woorthye the strongest Stout Diomed: bye the filds of Troy what fortun vnhappye Mee senst from falling wyth thy fierce slaughterus handstroke. Wheare lyes strong Hector slaughtred by manful Achilles. Wheare stout Serpedon dooth rest, where gauntlet or helmet In water of Simois, wyth souldours carcases harboure. This kyrye sad solfing, thee northen bluster aproching Thee sayls tears tag rag, to the sky thee waues vphoysing. The oars are cleene splintred, the helme is from ruther vnhafted Theire ships too larboord doo nod, seas monsterus haunt theym. In typs of billows soom ships wyth danger ar hanging. Soom synck too bottoms, sulcking thee surges asunder: Thee sands are mounted: thee southwynd merciles eager Three gallant vessels on rocks gnawne craggye reposed, (Theese rancks the Italian dwellers doo nominat altars) Lykewise three vessels the east blast ful mightelye whelmed In sands quick souping (a sight to be deepelye bewayled) One ship that Lycius dyd shrowd with faythful Orontes Jn sight of captayne was swasht wyth a roysterus heapeflud. Downe the pilot tumbleth wyth plash round soommoned headlong. Thrise the grauel thumping in whirkpoole plunged is hooueld Soom wights vpfloating on raisd sea wyth armor apeered. Jn foame froth picturs, wyth Troian treasur, ar vpborne. Also wher Jlionus was shipt, where manful Achates And what vessel Abas possest and aged Alethes Were bulcht by billows and boarde by forcibil entrye: Thee storme dyd conquoure, thee ships scant weaklye resisted. Theese vnrulye reuels, and rifrafs wholye disordred, As broyl vnexspected, thee sea king Neptun awaked. Sturd wyth theese motions, his pleasing pallet vpheauing Hee noted Æneas his touzdtost nauye to wander, And sees thee Troians wyth seas and rayne water heaped, This spightful pageaunt of his owne syb Iuno remembring, Thee wynds hee summond: and wroth woords statelye thus vsed. What Syrs? your boldnesse dooth your gentilitie warrant? Dare ye loa, curst baretours, in this my Segnorie regal, Too raise such raksiaks on seas, and danger vnorderd? Wel syrs: but tempest I wyl first pacifie raging. Bee sure, this practice wil I nick in a freendlye memento. Pack hence doggye rakhels, tel your king, from me, this errand. Of seas thee managing was neauer alotted his empire. That charge mee toucheth: but he may streth monsterus hildens, Youre kennels, good syrs: let your king Æolus hautye Execut his ruling in your deepe dungeon hardlye. Thus sayd, at a twinckling thee swelling surges he calmed Thee clowds hee scatterd, and cleere beams sunnye recalled. Cymothöe and Triton on steepe rock setled ar haling Thee ships from danger: with forck king Neptun is ayding. Hee balcks thee quicksands, and fluds dooth mollefye sweetly, Hee glyds on the seafroth, with wheales of gould wagon, easye. In mydst of the pepil much lyke to a mutenye raysed Where barcks lyke bandogs thee raskal multitud angry, Now stoans and fyrebrands flundge owt, furye weapon awardeth: In this blooddye riot they soom grauet haplye beholding Of geason pietee, doo throng and greedelye listen. Hee tames with sugred speeches theyre boysterus anger. In lykewise Neptun thee God, no sooner apeered In coche: when billows theire swelling ranckor abated. Thee weather hackt Troians to the next shoare speedely posting On Libye coast lighted: where they theire nauye reposed. Theare stands far stretching a nouke vplandish: an Island Theare seat, with crabknob skrude stoans hath framed an hauen. This creeke with running passadge thee channel inhaunteth. Heere doe lye wyde scatterd and theare cliues loftelye steaming, And a brace of menacing ragd rocks skymounted abydeth. Vnder hauing cabbans, where seas doo flitter in arches. With woods and thickets close coucht they be clothed al vpward. A cel or a cabban by nature formed, is vnder, Freshe bubling fountayns and stoanseats carued ar inward: Of Nymphes thee Nunry, wheere sea tost nauye remayning Needs not too grapple thee sands with flooke of an anchor. Hither hath Æneas with seaun ships gladlye repayred. On sands from vessels dooth skippe thee coompanye cheereful, Pruning theyre bodyees, that seas erst terribil harmed. First on flint smiting soom sparcklinges sprinckled Achates, Jn spunck or tinder thee quick fyre he kindly receaued. With sprigs dry wythered thee flame was noourrished aptly. Foorth do they lay vittayls, with storme disseasoned heauy. Theyre corne in quernstoans thye doe grind and toste yt on embers In the while Æneas too rock crept loftye, beholding In the sea far stretching yf that knight Antheus haplye, Were frusht, or remanent of Troian nauye wer hulling: Or Capis, or the armours high picht of manlye Caicus. No ships thence he scried, but three stags sturdye wer vnder Neere the seacost gating, theym slot thee clusterus heerdflock Jn greene frith browsing: stil he stands and snatcheth his arrows And bowbent sharply, from kind and faythful Achates: Chiefe stags vpbearing croches high from the antlier hauted On trees stronglye fraying, with shaft hee stabd to the noombles Throgh fels and trenches thee chase thee coompanye tracked, Theyre blades they brandisht, and keene prages goared in entrayls Of stags seun migty; with ships thee number is eeuened. With this good venery to the road thee captayn aproched And to his companions thee kild stags equalye sorted. With wyne theire venison was swyld, that Nobil Acestes In shore Trinacrian bestowd with liberal offer. Theese pipes Æneas then among thee coompany broched And with theese speeches theyre myndes thus he cherrished hautlye O deere companions (for we erst haue tasted of hardnes) Brawnd with woorse venturs, thee mightye God alsoe shal eend this. Through Sicil his raging wyld frets and rumbolo rustling On peeres you sayled, through Cyclops dangerus helcaue. On with a fresh courradge, and bace thoghts fearful abandon. Of peril escaped much shal thee vearye remembraunce Tickle vs in telling: through such sharp changeable hazards And doubtful dangers, oure course tward Italye bending, Wee must rush forward: oure seat theare destenye pitcheth. Theare must thee kingdoom with Troian fame be reuiued. Stand ye to your tacklings: and wayt for prosperus eendings. Thus did he speake manly, with great cares heauely loaden, His grief deepe squatting hoap he yeelds with phisnomye cheereful. They doe plye theire commons, lyke quick and greedye repastours Thee stags vpbreaking they slit to the dulcet or inchepyn. Soom doe slise owt collops on spits yeet quirilye trembling, Soom doe set on caldrons, oothers dooe kendel a bauen. With food they summond theyre force: and coucht in a meddow Theyre panch with venison they franck and quaffye carousing, When famin had parted, the tabils eeke wholye remooued, They theire lost feloes with long talck greedye requyred. With feare good coomfort mingling: yf so haplye they liued, Or that their liues thee tempest bitter had eended. But chiefly Æneas dyd wayle for manful Orontes And for knight Amicus, thee fats ek al heauye reuoluing Of Lycus and of sturdye Gyan, with woorthye Cloanthus. Now the eende neere streched; from seat when Juppiter heunly Thee seas, thee regions and eeche place worldlye beholding, On Lybye land lastly fixt his celestial eyesight. And thus as he mused, with tears Venus heauye beblubberd. Prest foorth in presence, and whimpring framed her errand. O God most pusiaunt, whose mighty auctoritye lasting Ruls gods, and mankind skeareth with thunderus humbling: What syn hath Æneas, my brat, committed agaynst the? What doe the poore Troians? Who with fel boucherye slaghterd For bending passadge to the promised Jtalye, therefor No worldly corner can theym securitye warrant. You to me ful promist, eare that yeers sundrye wer eended, That Roman famely should spring from the auncetrye Troian, By whom thee worldly coompas should wholye be ruled. Wherefor (mightye father) what dooth thy phansye thus alter? I tooke soom coomfort, when Troy was latelye repressed, With futur hap coomming, past fortun vnhappye requiting. And yeet theese wretched vagabunds hard destenye scourgeth When shal (Prince pusiant) theese dangers dryrye be canceld? Antenor was habil, from Grekish coompanye slincking, Too passe through Greceland saulfly to Lyburnical empyre. Also to thee fontayn welspring of woorthye Timauus. Where through nyne channels with mountayns murmerus hurring Rough the sea floas forward, thee land with snarnoise enhaunting Heere notwithstanding this founder buylded a cittye, That Padua is cleaped, too linnadge Troian alotted. And arms of Troytowne bearing: there he saulflie doth harboure. Wee that ar of kinred too the, and hast shrind in Olympus, Oure ships are whelmed through ons implacabil anger. (A pitiful reckning) we ar touzd, and from Italye feazed. Is this your daughters ritche dowry? her stablished empire? Thee prince of mankind, father of Gods, mirrelye simpring Lyk when he thee tempest with cheereful phisnomye calmeth, Bust his prittye parat prating, and mildlye thus aunswerd. Feare ye not (ô darling) on thy syde destenye runneth. Thee Roman towne wals thow shalt see loftelye raysed, And thy sun Æneas his glittring glorye to luster. This much J determyn, my mind no partye shal alter, Thy child Æneas (for sith such care the doth anguish, Thee fates close coouerd I wyl to the playnelye set open) Thy sun, J say, valiant shal foster in Jtaly garboyls, Strong and sturddye pepil with wars and victorye trampling. Theare shal he buyld cittyes, and theare laws ciuil enacting, Vntyl three summars shal coompas his hudge Lauyn empyre: And, the Rutils conquourd, three wynters stormye be glyding. But thy sun Ascanius, which is eeke surnamed Iulus, (Ilus he was termed, whilst stood the great Ilian empyre) Hee shal bee the regent, vntil yeers thirtye be flitted, From the Lauin kingdoom the state and thee chiefty remoouing: And with thick bulwarck shal he fence thee rampired Alba. Heere thre hundred wynters shal raigne knight Hector his ofspring, By Mars fyrye fatherd twyns tyl the Queene Ilia gender; Romulus in forrest of wulues dugge nurrished eager Shal take thee regiment, and towne wals statelye shal vpraise Of Rome, thee Romans of his owne name, Romulus, highting. This rule thus fixed no tyme shal limit, or hazard: Endles I do graunt yt: nay further Iuno fel harted, Thee seas, thee regions, thee skies so spightfulye moyling, Shal cut of al quarrels, and with mee newlye shal enter In leage with Romans, and gownesept charelye tender. Theese thus ar establisht. Theare shal cum a season herafter, When thee sayd famely shal crush Greeks segnorye throughly. Thee Troian Cæsar shal spire fro this auncetrye regal, His rule too Garamants, too stars his glorye rebounding Iulius of valerus princely surnamed Iulus. Thow shalt hym settle, with his east spoyls fraighted, in heunseat, Whom with relligious good vows shal magnifye diuerse. Thee world shal be quiet, then shal broyls bluddye be finnisht. Then playne sound dealing with laws of woorthye Quirinus And Remus, his broother, thee Roman cittye shal order. Thee gates of warfare wyl then bee mannacled hardly With steele bunch chayne knob, clingd, knurd, and narrolye lincked. Heere within al storming shal Mars bee setled on armoure With brasse knots hundred crumpled; with sweld furor haggish Lyke bandog grinning, with gnash tusk greedelye snarring. Thus sayd: he foorth posted (by May borne) Mercurye downeward That new buylt Carthage should house thee Troian asemblye. Hee flitters swiftly with wynges ful fledgye beplumed On Libye land seizing: ther he soone perfourmeth his erraund. Thee Moors are sweetned by Gods forwarned apoinctement, But chief of al Dido, thee Queene, was wroght to the Troians. But the good Æneas in night with care great awaked With Phœbus rising vpgot, too ferret al vncooth Nouks of strang country, in what coast his nauye doth harboure? If men, or yf sauadge wyld beastes ther in onlye doe pasture. For ther he no tillagde dyd find: thus was he resolued. And what he discoouerd, too tel to the coompanye flatly. His ships hee kenneld neere forrest vnder an angle Of rock deepe dented, shaded with thickleaued arbours. Hee walcks on priuat with noane but faythful Achates Darts two foorth bringing with sharp steele forcibil headed. Jn the myd of forrest as he gads, his moother aprocheth, In weed eke in visage lyke a Spartan virgin in armour Or lyke to Herpalicee, sweeft Queene, steeds strong ouerambling, Which doth in her running surpas thee swift flud of Hebrus. Shee bare on her shoulders her bow bent aptlye lyke huntresse; Downe to the wynd tracing trayld her discheaueled hearlocks; Tuckt to the knee naked: thus first shee forged her errand. Ho syrs, perceaud you soom mayden coompany stragling, Of my deere sisters with quiuer closelye begyrded Rearing with shoutcry soom boare, soom sanglier ougly? So Venus: and to Venus thee soon thus turned his aunswer. We hard of no showting, too sight no sister apered. Ô to the, fayre Virgin, what terme may rightlye be fitted? Thy tongue, thy visadge no mortal frayltye resembleth. Thart, No doubt, a Godesse, too Phœbus sister, or arcted Too Nymphs in kynred: to the lasting glorye be graunted. Smooth this craggye trauayl: tel what celestial harbour Coompaseth our persons: theese men, this countrye we know not. Vs to this od corner thee wynd tempestuus hurled. This fist shal sacrifice great flocks on thy sacred altars. Then Uenus: I daigne not my self wurth sutch honor heunly. Of Tyrian virgins too weare thus a quiuer is vsed. And to go thus thynly with wrapt vp purpil atyred. Thow seest large Affrick, thee Moores, and Towne of Agenor, Thee Libye land marckmears: a country manful in armoure. In this coast Dido, from her broother flitted, is empresse. Tedius in telling and long were the iniurye total: Chief poyncts I purpose too touche with summarye shortnesse. Her spouse Sichæus was namd, too no man vnequal In lands, her dandling with feruent passion hoatly. Her father in wedlock took to hym this virgin vnharmed. But then her owne broother was by right setled in empyre, Pygmalion named; thee sinck and puddil of hateful And furiouse cutthrots: hee murthred selly Sichœus, With gould looue blynded iump at thee consecrat altars. Of sisters freendship reckning; thee murther he whusted, His syb in her mourning with long coynd forgerye feeding. But loa, the proper image of corps vntumbed apeered In dreame too Dido; with pale wan phisnomye staring. His brest he vncloased, thee wound, and bluddyful altars. Thence to flit hee wild her, not long in countrye remayning, Tward her costlye viadge his wief to hyd treasur he poincted, Where the vnknowne ingots of gould and siluer abounded. Dido so wel fornisht too flee with coompanye posteth. Such folck as the tyrant pursude with vengeabil hatred, Or feard his regiment in thronging cluster asembled. They snach such vessels that then were rigd to be sayling Pigmalions riches was shipt, that pinchepeny boucher. And of this valiant attempt a woomman is authresse. Theare they were enshoared, wheare thow shalt shortlye se town wals, And citty vpsoaring of new Carthago to skytoppe. Thee plat they purchast, that place first Byrsa they cleaped And so much as a bulhyd could coompas craftelye getting. But syrs, whence coom you? what wights? or too what abyding Countrye do you purpose too passe? Thee capteyn amazed, And sobs deepe fetching, with sight ful sadlye thus aunswerd. O gay Godesse lustringe yf I made to the largelye recital, Or that of oure troubles you would to the summarye listen, Thee night thee sunbeams would shrowd in clasped Olympus. Wee coom from Troytowne (of Troyseat yf haplye the rumoure Youre ears hath tinckled) late a tempest boysterus haggard Oure ships to Libye land with rough extremitye tilted. I am kind Æneas, from foes thee snatcher of housgods Stowd in my vessels: in skyes my glorye doth harboure. Land I seek Italian: from Ioue my pettegrye buddeth. I made from Troytowne with vessels twentye to seaward, My dam myghtye Godesse gyding, I my destenye tracked. Rackt with soure blustring seaun ships ar scantlye recoouerd I lyke a poore pilgrim throgh desert angle of Affrick Wander, thrust from Asian regions and fortunat Europ. Heere Venus embarring his tale thus sweetlye replyed. What wight thwart, doubtlesse thee gods al greatlye doe tender Thy state, neere Tyrian citty so lucklye to iumble. Hence take thy passadge, to the Queenes court princelye be trudging. Theare thy coompanions with battred nauye be landed, With flaws crusht ruffling, with north blast canuased hurring. Thus stand thy recknings, vnlesse me myn augurye fayleth. Marck loa, se wel yoonder swans twelue in coompany flusshing And the skytip percing, enchast with a murtherus eagel Swift doe fle too landward, on ground al prest to be seazed. As theese birds feazed, theyre wyngs with solitye flapping, Sweepe the skye, with gladnes theyre creaking harmonye gagling, Eunso thye companions, or now with saulftye be shoared, Or, voyd of al danger, theyre ships are grappled at anchor. Speedelye bee packing, keep on hardlye the playne beaten highway. This sayd shee turned with rose color heaunlye beglittred. Her locks lyke Nectar perfumes sweet melloe relinquisht. Her trayne syd flagging lyke wyde spread Conopye trayled. Her whisk shewd Deity, hee finding his moother, in anger Chauffing; thee fugitiue with theese woords sharplye reprooued. What do ye meane (moother) with an elf show, vaynelye thus often Youre soon too iuggle? why oure hands both claspe we not hardly? Why do we not playnely good speeches mutual vtter? Tward citty trauayling thus he blames her forgerye masked. But Uenus enshrowds theym with a thick fog palpabil ayrye, Vnseen of eeche person by sleight inuisibil armed: Least soom theyre passadge with curius article hyndring Would learne, whence they trauayld? Too what coast ar they repayring? Shee to her loftye Paphos with gladnesse myrrye returneth: Wheare stands her temple with an hundred consecrat altars; Smoaking with the encense; the loa pauement senteth of herbflowrs. In thee meane season they doe passe directlye to towneward They trip too mountayns high typ, thee cittye but vnder Marcking; thee castels and turrets statelye beholding. Æneas woondreth; where dorps and cottages earst stood, For to se such sturring, such stuffe, such gorgeus handwoorck. Thee Moors drudge roundly; soom wals are loftelye raysing; Soom mount high castels; soom stoans downe tumble al headlong; Soom mearefurth platfoorms, for buylding curius houses; Soom dooe choose the Senat, sound laws and order enacting; Soom frame play theaters; soom deepelye dig harborus hauens; Soom for great palaces doo slise from quarrye the chapters. Lyke bees in summar season, through rustical hamlets That flirt in soonbeams, and toyle with mutterus humbling. When they do foorth carry theyre yoong swarme fledggie to gathring: Or cels ar farcing with dulce and delicat hoonnye: Or porters burdens vnloads, or clustred in heerd swarme Feaze away thee droane bees with sting, from maunger, or hiuecot, Thee labor hoat sweltreth: thee combs tyme flowrye be sprinckleth. O wights most blessed, whose wals be thus happelye touring Æneas vttred: thee towne top sharplye beholding. Hee throngs in shryne clowd (a strang and meruelus order) Through crowds of the pepil, not seene, nor marcked of annye. In towns myd center theare sprouted a groauecrop, in arbours Greene weede thick shaded, wheare Moors from surge water angry Parted, a good token dyd find: for Iuno, the Princesse, Theare the pate, in digging, of an horse intractabil vttred. Thee wise diuined, by this prognosticat horshead, That Moors wyde conquest should gayne with vittayl abundant. Heere to Iuno Godesse thee Princesse Dido dyd offer A fayre buylt temple, with treasure ritchlye replennisht. Thee stayrs brassye grises stately presented, here also Thee beams with brazed copper were costlye bepounced. And gates with the metal dooe creake in shrilbated harshing. In this greene frithcops a new sight newly repressed Long feareful dangers: Æneas freshlye beginneth For to raise his courradge: his sharp aduersitye treading, For whilst in temple corners hee gogled his eyesight Wayting for Dido; the stat of thee cittye beholding, Whilst craftmens coonning hee marckt with woonder amazed, Hee spied on suddeyn thee conflicts Troian al ordred, And that theire bickrings al soyls haue coompased earthly. Hee seeth Atrides, 'Priamus, to both hurtful Achilles. Fast he stood: and trickling dyd speake: what nouke (syr Achates) In world what region do not our toyls liuelye remember? Loa the, se king Priamus; soom crooms of glorye be resting. Soom tears this monument and soom compassion asketh. Pluck vp a good curradge? this fame soom saulftye wyl offer. Thus sayd, his hert throbbing with vayne dead pictur he feedeth; Groane sighs deepe reaching with tears his lyers ful he blubbred. Hee sees with baretours Troy wals inuironed hardly: Heere Greeks swiftlye fleing, theym Troiyouths coompanye crushing. Theare gad thee Troians: in coach runs helmed Achilles. Hee weeps also, seing flags whit, with Rhesus his holding In sleepe, whom napping, Tydides blooddye betrayed, His fierce steeds leading to the camp, er al hungrye they grased On Troian pasturs, or Xanth stream gredelye bibled. Troilus hee marcked running, deuested of armour: A lucklesse stripling, not a matche too coape with Achilles: With steeds he is swinged, downe picht in his hudge wagon emptye, Thee rayns yeet griping: his neck and locks fal a sweeping Thee ground, his launce staffe thee dust top turuye doth harrow. In thee meane season Troy dames too temple aproched Of fretting Pallas, with locks vntressed al hanging, With grief meeklye praying, with breast knocks humblye requesting. Thee Godes hard louring to the ground her phisnomye drowped. Theare thrise about Troy wals with spight knight Hector is haled. For gould his carcasse was sold by the broker Achilles. Heere sighs and sobbing from brest vp he mightelye rooted, Thus too see the wagon, thee spoyl, the vnfortunat ending Of deere companion, thee lyke cars also doe sting hym, For to se king Priamus, with his hands owtstreched, vnarmed. Hymself hee marcked combynd with Greekish asemblye. Hee noted Jndye pepil, with swart black Memnon his armye. Theare wear Amazonical woommen with targat, an haulfmoone Lykning, conducted by frantick Penthesilêa, No swarms or trouping horsmen can apale the virago, Her dug with platted gould rybband girded about her. A baratresse, daring with men, thogh a mayd, to be buckling. Whilst prince Æneas theese picturs woonderus heeded, And eeche pane throghly with stedfast phisnomye marcked, Too churche Queene Dido, thee pearle of bewtye, repayred: Of liuely yoonckers with a galland coompanye garded. In Cynthus forrest much lyk too swift flud of Eurot Where Nymphs a thowsand do frisk with Princelye Diana. On back her quiuer shee bears, and highlye the remnaunt Of Nymphs surpassing with talright quantitye mounting. Too se this, her spirit with secret gladnes aboundeth. Such was Dido ioying, so she with regalitye passed, With Princely presence thee wurcking coompanye cheering. In the gate of the Godesse shee syts, neere temple his arches In chayre stately throned, with clustring garrison armed. Shee frams firmlye statuts, and task wurcks equalye parteth. Or toyls too pioners by drawcut lotterye sorteth. Now sees Æneas with a crowding sudden asemblye Antheus and also Sergestus, doughtye Cloanthus, And oother Troians with rough seas stormye besweltred, Too soyl vnacquaynted by tempest horriblye pelted. Hee stands astonyed, so woondreth lykwise Achates: For to shak hands freendly fear bars, now gladnes on haleth. But the case vnwytted theym lets, thearfor they resolued, With darck clowd shaded, too learne theyr formor auentur, Wheare ryde theyre vessels? why they coom? what caus is of hastning? For they the pickt choisemen dyd cul from nauye, requesting Mercye, to the temple trotting with meruelus houling. When they wer in presence, of pleading pardon afurded, Then the braue Ilionus thus stout deliured his errand. O Queene most pusiaunt, too whom king Iuppiter heunly Too raise a new citty, by rare felicitye, graunted, And to rule a countrey, with scepter of equitye, sturdy: Wee caytiefe Troians, with storms ventositye mangled, Doo craue thee (Princesse) from flams oure nauye to guerdon. Yeeld pytye, graunt mercy; flowrs of gentilitye pardon. For we hither sayld not, thee Moors with an armye to vanquish; Or from their region with prede too gather an heardflock. Such valerus coorradge rarely men conquered haunteth. Theare stands a region, by Greeke bards He sperye named, A wel known countrey, for strong and plentiful holden, Theare dwelt th' Oenotrians; but in oure adge Italye cleaped, So namd of captayn: too this braue countrye we mynded Too bend oure iourney. But with a flaw suddeyn chauffing stormbringer Orion, Spurnt vs too the waters then sootherne swashruter huffling Flundge vs on high shelueflats, to the rocks vs he buffeted after. Heere then a poore remnaunt in this thy segnorye landed. What fel beastlye pepil rest heer? such barbarus vsadge What soyle wyld fosters? On sands they renounce vs an harboure. They doe byd vs battayl, fro the shoare thee coompanye pusshing. If ye doe skorne mankind, and eeche wight mortal his harming, Let Gods sharp Iustice in soom sort yeet be remembred, Oure king Æneas vs ruld, who for equitye rightful Euerye man owt passed, for feats and martial armoure. If this prince matchlesse no mortal destenye daunted, But yet is in breathing, from tempest saulflye recoouerd: First begin a freendshippe, for he wyl make fullye requital. In Sicil eek region fayre towneships sundrye be setled: In that od Isle raigneth, from Troyblud spirted, Acestes. Graunt foorth thy warrant in docks oure nauye toe settle: Graunt plancks from forrest too clowt oure battered inlecks; That we our king meeting may passe tward Italye sayling. If Libye seas raging the liefe of this captayn haue eended, If no good coomfort dooth rest of nobil Iulus: Suffer vs at leastwise, with iagged nauye retyring To Sicil oure passadge too bend, too famus Acestes. This speche had Ilionus: that song his coompanye chaunted. Brieflye then heere Dido, with downe cast phisnomye, parled. Rest ye quiet, Troians, your thoghts from danger abandon. In great sundrye peryls, my state set rawlye me streineth Too keepe thus the seacoast with ward and garrison heedeful. Who doe not Æneas, or Troian cittye remember? Theire valor and courradge, theyre fyrebrand glorius onsets? Wee Moors, lyke dullards, are not so wytles abyding, Nor Phebe from oure citty dooth so far sunder his horses. Yf ye be determynd, too sayl to old Italye Saturne, Or to Sicil backward to the king, right nobil, Acestes, Ile ye man, esquipping youre ships with furniture aptlye. Or wyl you soiourne in this my feminin empyre? In towne you denisons J do make: let nauye be docked. Troians and Tyrians I wyl with one equitye measure. Would God your captayn with sootherne blastpuf inhurled Heere made his arriual; but a watch tward mouth of eche hauen Speedelye shal be placed, your chieftayn woorthye to ferret: Wheather he through forrest dooth range, or wandreth in hamlets. This princelye promisse boldning both manful Achates And father Æneas, thee clowd with greedines eager Too cleaue they coouet: to Æneas thus first sayd Achates. Thow sun of heunlye Godesse, how stands thy phansye resolued? Thow seest al cocksure, thy fleete, thy coompanye salued. One ship is only absent, that in oure sight sanck to the bottom. Thy moothers prophecy to the remnaunt fitlye doth aunswere. Scant had he thus spoken, when clowd theym drossye relinquisht, And from earthly thicknesse, too thinnesse vannished ayerye. Theare stud vp Æneas, with glittring beautye redowning. Godlyke in his feauture: for his heunly moother amended His bush with trimming, his sight was yoouthlye bepurpled: His looke sweete simpred, much lyke to the pullished iuerye By crafts hand burnisht: or with Phœbe siluer enameld: Or touch stoane brazed with deepe gould purelye refined. Hee then vnexspected to the Queene thus brauelye replyed. Heere do I stand present, whom you so gladlye required, Æneas Troian from stormes defalcked of Affrick. Of trauayl of Troians, O Queene, thee succeres only. Wee crooms of Troians with land and seafurye moyled, Of welth dispoyled, lyke plodding stormebeaten haglers From natiue country, from citty exiled abyding, For theese thy benifits too make lyke freendlye requital J may not, Dido: nay the routs of progenye Troian Through wyde world scatterd, can not make woorthy repayment. Thee Gods (yf Deitee worcks of wights godlye regardeth, If right bee raigning, yf vertue is too be rewarded) Yeeld to the lyke kyndnesse, What world, what vertuus heunly Both father and moother gaue breath to so peereles a daughter. Whilst hils cast shaddows, whilst streams to the seas be reuoluing, Whilst stars ar twinckling in the orbs of fixed Olympus, Thy fame with thine honor shal bee by eternitye blazed To what coast I trauayl: Theese speeches duytiful vttred Hee shaks Ilionus with right hand, alsoe Serestus With lefthand, so doughtye Gian, so doughtye Cloanthus. First was Queene Dido with a sight thus sudden apaled, Next with his hard venturs, and thus shee rendred her aunswer. Thow sun of hautye Godesse, what crooked dangerus hazards Pursu thy person? what seas thee terribil hither Haue flounst? And art thow Æneas mightye, begotten Of thy syre Anchises, and of Uenus at Simo fountayne? J saw king Teucer whillon too Sidon aproching Expulst fro his regions, his right with might too recouer, And with ayd of Belus: then my sire Belus in Jsland Of Cyprus raigned, that land with victorie may string From that tyme forward I knewe thee Troian auenturs, Thee name of thee citty, what kings succeded in empyre. Enne thee veri enimy thee Troians glorye did vtter. And from theyre linnadge right hee deriued his ofspring. Whearefor, freend Troians, with draw your selues to mye lodgings. Mee the lyk hard venturs erst, and aduersitye suffring In this new kingdoom good fortun lastlye reposed, My self erst flighted to reliue thee flicted I learned. Thus shee discoursed: to palaice foorth statelye she leadeth Thee prince Æneas; when seruice godlye was eended. Thee whilst to his nauy shee caused twentye fat oxen Straight to be conueighed, with an hundred bristeled hudge brawns, Of sheepe lyke number with lambs: gods mightye rewarding. But the inner lodgings were with regalitye trimmed. Jn mydst of chaumber thee roume for bancket is apted, Thee wals are cloathed with massy and purpuled arras, Of plate great cupboords, thee gould embossed in anticque Patterns, her linnadge by long fetcht pettegre trayling Of syers thee bedrol with natiue countrye recorded. Then the good Æneas (for carcking natural eggeth Thee mynd of the parent) to the vessels posted Achates, This to tel Ascanius, conducting hym to the cittye. Thee syre in his darlings good successe chieflye reioyceth. Lykwise he commaunded too bring from nauye the presents Snacht from Troy ransackt, with gould frets ritchlye bedawbed. Also the roabe pretiouse colored lyke sausred Achantus: Which plad vested Helen, from Greece when to Troy she flitted: Her weeds of wedlock, that her haut dam Leda dyd offer, Of price a rare present: also thee scepter he willed Of the fayr Ilionee to be broght: this fayrye was eldest Of Priamus daughters, this mace too carrye she woonted: Thee pearle and gould crowns too bring with garganet heauye. With this charge vttred to the vessels hastned Achates. But Uenus in musing with caers intoxicat hudling New sleights fresh forgeth: the face of trim prittye Cupido Too chang with iuggling, whereby hee too Dido resorting Jn place of Ascanius, with gyfts might carrye the Princesse Too braynesick loouefits, to her boans fire smouldered huffling. For Uenus haulf doubteth thee Moors sly treacherus handling: Juno her tormenteth: by night this terror her haunteth. This reason her sturring thus spake she to cocknye Cupido. My sweete choise bulcking, my force and my power onlye, My baby despising thee bolts of Iuppiter angrye; Of the request I refuge, with meeke submission humbled. Thow knowest Æneas, by broothers byrth to the lincked, Through seas to haue wandred by Iunoes merciles hattred: Thow knowst thee venturs: my grief thy hert often hath anguisht. Dido enterteigneth this guest with curtesye ciuil. Yeet do J stil feare me theese fayre Iunonical harbours. In straw thear lurcketh soom pad: yeet wyl she be sturring. Thearefor her endeuours with counter craftinis hynder. Inflame thee Princesse with looues affection earnest That mye sun Æneas with mee shee chieflye may dandle. This drift too coompasse let this my loare be wel heeded. At the fathers sending thee boy to the cittye repayreth. (Delicat Ascanius, whose forward succes I tender) With many rich presents from Troyflams narrolye scaped. This child fast sleeping wyl I lodge in loftye Cythera, Els on hil Jdalium in seat sacred he shal be reposed. Least that he this stratagem should find, or woorck wylye founder. Thow shalt his visadge for a nights space fitlye resemble. Thee gayboy kindlye playing, thee knowne lads phisnomye taking: That when Queene Dido shal col the, and smacklye bebasse thee, When quaffing wynebols, when bancquets deyntye be serued, When she shal embrace thee, when lyplicks sweetlye she fastneth; That then thow be suer, too plant thy poysoned hoat looue. Too moothers counsayl thee fyrye Cupido doth harcken Of puts he his feathers, fauoring with gatetrip Julus. But Venus enfuseth sweet sleepe to the partye resembled, Too woods Idalian thee child nice cocknyed heauing Jn seat of her boosom: neere senting delicat herbflowrs Of pretious Maioram, with shade most temperat housed. But now thee changling with gyfts dooth trudge to the cyttye On to the court posting: his gyde was trustful Achates. When that he too chaumber, most stately decked, aproched Dido sat on beadsteed with curtens gorgeus hanged. Then father Æneas with Troian cluster asembled: On palet of scarlet they were for cossherye setled. Thee wayting seruaunts riche basons massye doe carrye Alsoe wyping towels: maunchets sum in pantrye doe basket Fiftye busy damsels with charge of buttrye be tangled With flame eke relligiouse too fire thee consecrat aultars. Maydens, manseruaunts, of eche is there numbred an hundred, That with princelye viand the tabils al francklye doe furnish. Thee Tyrian lordings too Court most freshlye resorted. On neeld wroght carpets theese guestes were al vsshered aptly. Æneas presents they marck, they doe gaze at Julus. His face goodlye roset, with speaking forgerye feigned. They doe look at mantel, with roabs of saffrod Achanthus: To futur harme lotted: but chiefllye the princes vnhappie Is not with gazing contented fullye, but eauer Shee doth eye thee presents: thee mopsy her phantasye lurcheth. On father Æneas his neck thee dandiprat hangeth. And to his great lyking his syre supposed he gayneth.

But this prittye peacock, his dames charge slilye remembring, First of al attempteth too raze from phansye Sichaus. With quick looue liuing fro the dead the affection haling: Too new flamd liking her mynd, erst rustye, reducing. When fare was finnisht the tabils eeke stately remooued Hudge bols thick they placed, with garlands crownd the they mazars. Al the palaice ringeth with stamp, a mutterus humming Tinckleth through the entryes: the tapers eeke kendled ar hanging From gold wyre glittring: thee night with brightnes is owted.

This cup king Belus with her old syers former al vsed. Thee rout kept a silence, theese speeches Dido dyd vtter. Iuppiter (of guest folcks thee stay thwart truelye reported) Graunt that this present Tyrian with Troian asemblye May breede good fortune to our freends and kynred heer after. Let make sport Bacchus, with good ladye Iuno, be present. And ye, my freend Tyrians, thee Troian coompanye frollick. Thus sayd, with sipping in vessel nycelye she dipped.

Wyth tentiue lystning eeche wight was setled in harckning, Thus father Æneas chronicled from lofty bed hautye. You me byd, O Princesse, too scarrify a festered old soare. How that thee Troians wear prest by Græcian armye. Whose fatal misery my sight hath wytnesed heauye: Jn which sharp byckring my self, as partye, remayned. What ruter of Dolopans weare so cruel harted in harckning, What curst Myrmidones, what karne of canckred Vlisses That voyd of al weeping could eare so mortal an hazard? And now with moysture thee night from welken is hastning: And stars too slumber dooe stur mens natural humours. How beyt (Princelye Regent) yf that thy affection earnest Thy mynd enflameth, too learne our fatal auentures, Thee toyls of Troians, and last infortunat affray: Thogh my queazy stomack that bluddye recital abhorreth, And tears with trilling shal bayne my phisnomye deepelye: Yeet thyn hoat affected desyre shal gayn the rehersal. Thee Greekish captayns with wars and destenye mated, Fetching from Pallas soom wise celestial engyn, Framd a steed of tymber, steaming lyk mounten in hudgnesse. A vow for passadge they faynde, and Brute so reported. In this od hudge ambry they ramd a number of hardye Tough knights, thick farcing thee ribs with clustered armoure. In sight is Tenedos of Troy; thee famosed Island; Whilst Priamus floorisht, a seat with ritches abounding. But now for shipping a rough and dangerus harboure. Theare lurckt theese minions in sort most secret abiding. Al we then had deemed, to Græce that the armye retyred Thearefor thee Troians theyre longborne sadnis abandon: Thee gates vncloased they skud with a liuely vagare, Thee tents of the enymyes marcking, and desolat hauen. Heere foght thee Dolopans, theare stoutly encountred Achilles, Heere rode thee nauye: theare battayls bluddye wear offred. Soom do loke on dismal present of loftye Minerua. Also they gaze woondring at the horse his meruelus hudgnesse And first exhorteth thee Troians seallye Tymetes Too bring thee monument intoo thee cittye; then after For to place in stately castel thee monsterus Idol. Wheather he ment treasons, or so stood destenye Troian. But Capys and oothers diuing more deepelye to bottom, Warelye suspecting in gyfts thee treacherye Greekish, Dyd wish thee woodden monster weare drowned, or harbourd In scorching fyrebrands: or ribs too spatter a sunder. Thee wauering Commons in kym kam sectes ar haled. First then among oothers, with no smal coompanye garded Laocoon storming from Princely castel is hastning, And a far of beloing: what fond phantastical harebrayne Madnes hath enchaunted your wits, you townsmen vnhappye? Weene you (blynd hodipecks) thee Greekish nauye returned? Or that theyre presents want craft? Is subtil Ulisses So soone for gotten? My lief for an haulf penye (Troian?) Either heer ar couching soom troups of Greekish asemblye, Or to crush our bulwarcks this woorck is forged, al houses For to prye surmounting thee towne: soom practis or oother Heere lurcks of coonning: trust not this treacherus ensigne: And for a ful reckning, I lyk not barrel or hearing. Thee Greeks bestowing theyre presents Greekish J feare mee. Thus sayd: he stout rested, with chaapt staf speedelye running Strong the steed he chargeth, thee planck rybs manfuly riuing. Then the iade, hit, shiuered, thee vauts haulf shrillye rebounded With clush clash buzing, with droomming clattered humming. Had Gods or fortun no such course destenye knedded: Or that al our senses weare not so bluntlye benummed Thear sleight and stratagems had beene discoouered easlye, Now Troy with Priamus castel most statelye remayning. But loa, the mean season, with shouting clamorus hallow Of Troytowne the shepheerds a yoncker mannacled haling Present too Priamus: this guest ful slylye dyd offer Hymself for captiue, thearby too coompas his heasting, And Troian citty to his Greekish countrye men open. A brasse bold merchaunt in causes dangerus hardye. In doubtful matters thus stands hee flatlye resolued, Or to cog: or certeyn for knauerye to purchas a Tyburne. Thee Troian striplings crowding dooe cluster about hym: Soom view thee captiue, soom frumping quillites vtter. Now lysten lordings, too Greekish coosinage harcken, And of one od subtil stratagem, most treacherus handling Conster al. For when this princox in mydst of throng stood vnarmed, Heedelye thee Troians marcking with phisnomye staring: Oh, quod he, what region shal shrowd mee villenus owtcast? Whearto shal J take me forlorne unfortunat hoaplost? From Greekish countrey do J stand quit bannished: also Thee wrath hoat of Troians my blood now fierclye requireth. Thus with a sob sighing our mynds with mercye relenting Greedelye wee coouet, too learne his kinred, his errand, His state, eke his meaning, his mynd, his fortun, his hazard. Then the squyre emboldned dreadles thus coyned an aunswer. King: my faith I plight heere, to relate thee veritye soothlye. I may not, I wyl not deny my Greecian ofspring. Thogh Sinon a caytiefe by fortun scuruye be framed A lyer hym neauer may she make, nor cogger vnhonest. If that, king pusiaunt, ye haue herd earst haplye reported Thee name of thee famouse Palamedes greatlye renowmed: Thee Greeks this captayne with villenus iniurye murdred: Hym they lying charged with treasons falslye, for hyndring Forfooth theyre warfars: hym dead now dolfulye mourne they: Too serue this woorthy, to hym neerely in kinred alyed, My father vnwelthy mee sent, then a prittye page, hither. Whilst he stood in kyngdoom cocksure, whilst counsel auayled, Then we were of reckning; our feats weare duelye regarded. But when my coosen was snapt by wycked Ulisses, (A storye far publisht, no gloasing fabil J twattle) With Choloricque fretting I dumpt, and ranckled in anguish: My tongue not charming with fumimg fustian anger Playnelye with owt cloaking, I vowd to be kindlye reuenged, Eauer yf I backward too native countrye returned. And thus with menacing lyp threats J purchased hatred. Hence grew my crosbars, hence always after Vlisses With new forgd treasons me, his foa, too terrefye coouets. Oft he gaue owt rumours, hee fabled sundrye reportes, Mee to trap in matters of state, with forgerye knauish. His malice hee fostred, tyl that priest Calchas he gayned. But loa, to what purpose do I chat such ianglerye trim trams? What needs this lyngring? syth Greeks ye hold equal in hatred, Syth this eke herd, serueth, speede furth your blooddye reuengment. So ye may ful pleasure thee Greeks, and profit Ulisses. Thee les he furth pratled, thee more wee longed in harcking, Too learne al the reasons, no Greekish villenye doubting, Thee rest chil shiuering he with hert deliuered hollow. Thee Greeks theyre passadge very oft determined homward. And clooyd with byckring theese wars they thoght to relinquish. Would God yt had falne so: yet yt had so truelye; but often South wynds with wynter storming theyre iournye dyd hinder. Also of late season, when the horse was finnished holye Thee skyes lowd rumbled with ringing thunderus hurring. With weather astonyed, with such storms geason agry sed, Wee sent Euripilus too sacred Apollo for aunswer. Too soon he this messadge ruful from the oracle vttred. Thee wynds with bloodshed were swagd, with slaughter of hallowd Uirgin, to Troy ward when first you bended a nauye, Youre viage also hoamward a slaughter blooddye requyreth. Thee wynd puffe blustring no blood but Greecian asketh. When knight Euripilus this messadge crooked had opned, Then we were al daunted, with trembling feareful atached, What Greek for sacrifice thee God demaunded Apollo. Shortlye the priest Calchas was broght by the shrewdwyt Vlisses, And now soar laboreth, too know what person is asked. Diuerse dyd prophecy foorth with my destenye final. That this new practise from my old foes treacherye sprauleth. Thee priest twise fiue dayes thee case with secreacye sealeth. Hee maks it scrupulous forsooth with blooddye rehersal Of tongue, too sacrifice a wight: hym pressed Ulisses This not with standing, with long importunat vrging, Of purpose Calchas mee wretch too the altar apoincted. Thearto the rest yeelded; for what theym priuat had anguisht, On me they soone setled with publicque ioyful agreement. With posting passadge thee day most dismal aproched, Thee fruits al be ready, garland to mye temple is apted, My scape J deny not, my flight from prison I knowledge, Thee woas and the myry foule bogs for an harborye taking Vntil they to seaward had packt, and sayles had hoysed. Now shal I wayle, poore soule, from natiue countrye remoued, Of father accoumpting my self, of chyldren al hoaplesse. Whose giltlesse slaughter be my flight is lyke to be coompast. Thee do I craue, Priamus, by Gods almightye supernal (Yf truth, yf unfayned good fayth dooth floorish among men) For to spare a wretched fugitiue thus touzed in hatred. Wee thawde with weeping doo pardon francklye the villeyn. In person Priamus foorth with commaunded his yrons For to be disioyncted, theese woords eke gratius adding. What wight th' wart, stranger, no Greekish countrye remember. Thow shalt be a Troian; yet in one doubt truelye resolue me. What means this burly shapte horse? what person is author? For what relligion? what drift? what martial engyn? This sayd: my yooncker with Greekish treacherye lessond; Too stars vp mounting both his hands vnmannacled, aunswerd. You fires perpetual with rits vnspotted abyding, Too you for wytnesse do J cal: you mystical altars, You swoords J fled from, that I woare, you consecrat headbands, I do hold yt lawful, to reueale thee mysterye Greekish, Too scorne theyre persons, to blab theyre secrecye priuat. What law can bynd mee, to be trew to so wycked a countrey? So that you, Troians, in promist mercye be constant, Jf truth I shal manifest, yf gifts bee largelye requited. Thee Greeks assuraunce in Pallas whoalye remayned And with her assistaunce theyre wars were shouldered always. But syth Tydides, eke of euels thee founder Ulisses Attempted lewdly fro the church to imbeazel an holy Patterne of Pallas, thee keepers filthelye quelling, Then they the sacred image with brude fist blooddye prophaned, Thee virgins garlands with contempt impius handling: Syth they that attempted, thee Greekish succes abated And ther hoap albackward dyd drag: thee virgin eke angrye. And her wrath the Godesse with signs most sensibil opned. Scant was this patterne of Pallas setled among vs When flams of firy flasshing most terribil hissed: Jt sweat with chauffing: three tymes (to to strang to be spoken) From ground yt mounted, both launce and targat eke holding. Through seas priest Calchas, to retyre back hastelye, wisheth For that agaynst Troians thee Greeks doo vaynelye bear armoure. Tyl that with the Godesse theymselues too Greece be returned. Which they perfourmed. Now that they sayled ar hoameward They puruey weapons and Gods too pacifye purpose, And to returne hastly: thus Calchas eeche plat hath ordred. They framd this monument to appease celestial anger Of the Godesse Pallas, the prophet that practis apoincted. Howbeyt, Priest Calchas would haue the horse lifted in hudgnesse, Lest you, thee Troians, through gats should carrye the present. And so to bee shielded yet agayn with patronage anticque. If you with violence this gyft too scatter had hapned, Graund heaps of mischief (which Gods on the author his hertroote First set (I doo pray theym) should Troian cittye replennish. And yf this relliek by you to the cittye wer haled, Then, loa, the stout Troians in wars should glorye triumphing, Wee to ye, lyke bondslaues, our selues for vanquished offring. With this gay glosing of a stincking periured hangman Wee wer al inueigled, with wringd tears nicetye blended. Those whom Tydides, whom Lauissœan Achilles And al theyre warlick vessels, in number a thowsand, In ten yeers respit could not with victorye vanquish. But marck what foloed: what chaunce and luck cruel hapned Iump with this cogging, our mynds and senses apaling. As priest Laocoon by lot to Neptun apoyncted A bul for sacrifice ful sizde dyd slaughter at altars, Then, loa ye, from Tenedos through standing deepe flud apeased (I shiuer in telling) two serpents monsterus ouglye Plasht the water sulcking to the shoare moste hastelye swinging. Whose brests vpsteaming, and manes blood speckled inhaunced Hygh the sea surmounted, thee rest in smooth flud is hydden Their tayls with croompled knot twisting swashlye they wrigled. Thee water is rowsed, they doe frisk with flownse to the shoare ward, Thee land with staring eyes bluddy and firie beholding: Their fangs in lapping they stroak with brandished hoat tongs. Al we fle from sacrifice with sight so grisled afrighted. They charg Laocoon, but first they raght to the sucklings, His two yong children with circle poysoned hooking. Theym they doe chew, renting theyre members tender a sunder. In vayne Laocoon the assault lyke a stickler apeasing Js to sone embayed with wrapping girdle y coompast, His midil embracing with wig wag circuled hooping, His neck eke chayning with tayls, hym in quantitye topping, Hee with his hands labored theyre knots too squise, but al hoaples Hee striues: his temples with black swart poyson ar oyncted. Hee freams, and skrawling to the skye brays terribil hoyseth. Much lyke as a fat bul beloeth, that setled on altar Half kild escapeth thee missing boucherus hatchet. But theese blooddye dragons too sacred temple aproched Vnder feete lurcking and shield of mightye Minerua. A feare then general mens mated senses atached. Wee iudge Laocoon to be iustly and woorthelye punnisht, For that he rash charged with launce thee mystical idol. Streight to place in citty this image, too pacifye swiftly Thee Godes offended, they doe crye. Downe we beat oure rampiers, our towne wals gap wyd ar opned. Al we fal a woorcking, thee wheels wee prop with a number Of beams and sliders, thee neck with cabil is hooped. Through wals downe razed wee draw thee mischeuus engyn, Ful bagd with weapons: sonnets are carroled hymnish By lads and maydens, the roap ons to tip hertelye longing. Hit slids, and menaceth futur hurt in cittye reposed. ô Gods, ô countrey, ô Troywals stronglye be rampyerd Foure tymes this monument at townegats staggred in entring, Foure tymes with the armour close coucht thee paunch bely classhed. How beyt, blynd bayards we plod on with phrensie bedusked, And in thee castel we doe pitch this monster vnhappye. By Gods commaundment thee trouth Cassandra reuealed, Neauer in her prophecyes by the Troians seallye beleeued. Wee for a last farewel doo deck through cittye the temples. Thee whilst night darcknesse right after soonset aproched, With shaddow clowding earth, heun, and treacherie Greekish. Thee Greeks that glyded through wals, al softlye be whusted. Then the Phalanx Greekish dyd sayl with nauye wel ordred From Tenedos: shinings of moone most freendlye doe gyde theym. To the shoare acquaynted they doe shooue: fyre of admiral hoysed, Streight Sinon, assured by Gods and destenye wrongful, Thee stuf paunch closet from lincking ioynctlye releaseth. Thee doores discloased, by roaps thee coompanye slided. Tisandrus, Sthenelus captayns, hard herted Ulisses. And Athamas, next also Thoas foorth ishued bastlye. Also Neoptolemus, but of oothers chieflye Machäon. Downe Menelaus is holpt, of the engyn forger Epëus. Oure men ar assaulted, with sleepe, with druncknes asotted. Thee watch they murthred, thee gats set eke open, a cluster Of theyre companions they let in, thee coompanye lincketh. Then was yt a season, when slumber sweetlye betaketh Eech mortal person by woont and natural order. I, loa, then in sleeping, to my seeming sorroful Hector Prest furth in presence, and salt tears dolfulye showred. Harryed in steedyocks as of earst, black bluddye to visadge With dust al powdred, with filthood dustye bedagled. His feet ar vpswelling with raynes of bridil ybroached. Woa me God, how greatly was he chaunged from that od Hector, Too Troy that whillon dyd turne with spoyls of Achilles, Or that with wyldfire thee Greekish nauye beskorched. His berd was sloottish, thee blood, thick cluttred, his hears staynd. Those wounds wyde bearing, that he neere thee cittye receaued. I then, as I deemed by myn own wyl, thearto not asked, Wept, in this maner to hym speeches sorroful vttring. O star of al Troians, of towne thee prosperus holder, What lets thee lingred? from what far countrye, syr Hector, Long loockt for coomst thow? so that after dangerus hazards, And diuers burials of freends, of kinred, of oothers Wee tost now doe se thee. By what chaunce filthye thy visadge Is thus disfigured? Theese wounds why mortal apeere they? Hee litle accoumpted this fond and vanitye childish, But sighs vpplucking from brest ful deepelye, thus aunswerd. Thow soon of holye Godesse, from flame thy carcas abandon. Thee foes haue conquerd, Troytowne is fired of al sydes. Too citty and Priamus lief ynough Gods destenye graunted. Yf that thee Troians hand stroaks could fortefye manful, This fiste, Greeks hacking, that fensiue seruice had eended. Too the recommendeth Troytowne theyr consecrat housgods. Take theese for the pilots of fats, by theyr ayd seke a cittye. Which stately towne wals by thee shalstronglye be founded, Through large seas passadge when thou shalt wander hereafter. Thus sayd: thee garland, mee thoght, and Vesta the mightye From altars down fetching, thee fiers eternal he quenched. Thee whilst in citty there roard a changabil howling, Stil the noise encreaseth (yea thogh that verye far inward My father Anchises his court was setled in arbours) Thee skrich rings mounting, increast is the horror of armoure, From sleepe I broad waked, to top hastly of turret J posted, And to the shril yerning with tentiue greedines harckned. Much lyke as in corneshocks sindged with blasterus hurling Of Southwynd whizeling: or when from mounten a rumbling Flud raks vp foorrows, ripe corne, and tillage of oxen. Downe tears yt wyndfals, and thick woods sturdelye tumbleth. Thee crack rack crashing the vnwytting pastor amazeth. Now Greeks most playnely their craft, long hammered, opned. Vulcan hath, in flaming, quit burnt, by his furnitur heating, The house of Deiphobus, then next his neighbor his housframe Vcalegon kendleth, Thee strand flams fyrye doe brighten. Thee towns men roared, thee trump taratantara ratled. Thus then I distracted, with al hastning, ran to mye weapons, Too shock in coombats, or gard with coompanye castels Mee my wyl on spurreth, thus wrath, thus phrensye me byddeth. And to dye with byckring I tooke for a glorius emprice. But see: priest Panthus of towne and sacred Apollo Panthus Otriades thee Greekish boucherye scaping, Heeld in his hands holy rellicques, Gods conquered, also His yoong prittye nephew, to the strandward speedelye trotting. What news, syr Panthus? what forte were best to be fenced? Scant sayd I theese speeches, when woords to me dolful he rendred. Woorthye Syr, our last houre is coom, too late to be mourned. Wee were in old season Troians, Troy cittye was, also Thee Troian glory floorisht: now Iuppiter hardned Hath the state of Troians subuerted wholye. The pertlyke Greeks thee flamd citty with ruthlesse victorye ransack. Theire steed hath vpvomited from gorge a surfet of armdmen. Fals Sinon aduaunced, with fire, consumeth al houses, And flouts vs kindly: thee gats ar cramd with an armye. Such troups as neauer too citty Troian aneered. Soom stop al od corners, no nouke, no passage vnarmed. They brandish weapons sharp edgde, to slaghter apoincted. In first encounter thee watch to to weaklye resisted. With woords of Panthus, and with Gods herried order Kendled, J run forward too rush throgh thicket of armoure, Wheare shouts vpclymbing most rise, wheare is hertsad Erynnis. Theare leags as feloes Ripheus strong, Iphitus hardy. By moonshyne roaming Hipanis, so syr Dymas eager Flanck furth oure vaunt gard: next cooms thee lustye Chrorœbus Soon to Prince Mygdon, who then not lucklye repayred Too Troy: with lyking of mad Cassandra bewitched: Soon to king Priamus by law: thus he lawfather helping, His pheers wood prophecyes not at al the yooncker vnhappye Herd. This band of Troians thus ioynctly assembled, I framed This speeche: Stout gallants, braue youths, and coompanye manful, Yf ye be determynd too sinck in martial hazards, Too lyms, to carcasse you see what fortun is offred. Al things goa backward: thee Gods have flatlye renounst vs. Oure state that whillon preserud: thee cittye to rescue, Cleene burnt, were fruictles: let vs hardlye be slaughtred in armour Tamde men haue one saulfty, not in hoap to settil a saulftye. Theese woords theyre valiant courradge dooe scarrifye deeply, Lyke rauening woolfdams vpsoackt and gaunted in hunger, That range in clowd shade: theyre whelps neere starued ar eager And expect vdders with dry iaws: so doe we iustle: Wee keepe thee midpath with darcknesse nightye beueyled Lord, bye whose heunly vttra?ce may that nights blood be reco?ted? Or match thee misery with counteruay labil howling? The old towne fals to ruin, that summers sundrye was empresse. Thee streets and kennels are with slayne carcases heaped: Euery house, eech temple with ruful slaughter aboundeth. And yeet thee Troians are not men vanquished onlye: Sparcks of an old courradge to the conquourd freshlye be turning. Thee Greekish victours not in eeche stroke shot fre remayned. Loud was thee yelling, great fears and murther of al sydes. Of Greeks thee first man with a gallant coompanye garded Fronted vs, Androgeos, for freends vs simplye beleeuing. In gentil manner thus he soone discoursed, vnasked. Hast forward feloes: what means this luskish aproching? You drawlach loytrers are scant from nauye repayring, When your companions with spoyls of cittye be loaden. Hee sayd: eke on suddeyn (for he was not freendlye lik aunswerd) Hee spyed his person with Troian coompanye wheeled, Thence dyd he shrinck backward, his woords al softlye repressing. Lyke when as a trauayler thee snake with brambel ycoouerd Vnwytting squiseth, with chaunce so sudden amazed, Speedelye whips backward from woorme, with poysoned anger Upsweld. Androgeos lykwise most gastlye reculed. Wee charge thee minions with round and compased armoure. In streets vnknowne they doe fal, with terror apaled. Our first encounter by fortun lucklye was ayded. This successe cheering and fleashing lustye Choræbus, Thus spake he: Deere sociats, syth we haue this prosperus on set, Now let vs on forward, as luck and destenye gydeth. And let vs our targets exchange, and Greecian armour Al clap on oure bodyes, marching with Greecian ensigne. Craft or doughtye manhod what nice wight in foa requyreth? Thee Greeks shal furnish weapons. This spoken, an helmet Of knight Androgeos glistring on pallet he pitcheth. Hee took eke his target, then in hand his fawchon he griped. Thee lyke dyd Ripheus, Dymas, and thee youthful asembly. With new raght weapons eeche wight is newlye refreshed. Too Greeks wee linckt vs, by Gods direction holpen. In night shade darcknesse with foes wee skyrmished eft soons, And with hoat assalting too Limbo we plunged a number. Soom run to vessels too strondward swiftlye retyring Soom clymb theyre steeds womb, freight with perplexitye dastard, Oh, Labor is fruictlesse, which Gods and destenye frustrat. Lo ye; the wood virgin, with locks vnbroyded is haled Cassandra, and trayled from temple of holye Minerua. In vayn her eyes flamed too seat celestial heauing: Her wrists eke tender with cord weare mannacled hardlye. This sight foule freighted with woodful phrensye Chorœbus Hee runs too rescu, lyk a bedlem desperat, headlong. Wee the man hoat foloed, wee coapt with Greekish asemblye. Now be we peale pelted from tops of barbican hautye Maynelye with our owne men by stoans downe rouled among vs. This dolye chaunce gald vs, with blood, with slaghter abounding, For that thee townsmen knew not this chaffar of armoure. Thee Greeks al furious, too see Cassandra recoouerd, Dyd band too geather: but chief thee courraged Aiax And both the Atridans, thee stout Deloponian armye. Lyke wrastling meete winds with blast contrarius huzing, East, weast and Southwynd, with pufroare mightelye ramping, Hudge trees downe trample: theare with God Neptun awaked Thee seas with chauffing and strecht mace merciles hoyseth. Also such old enymyes: policy that former aflighted And coucht in corners, with a vengaunce freshlye retyred, And first discoouerd thee shields and treacherye feigned. Our speech eke and gybbrish theyre guesh dyd fortefye soothlye. Down cooms thee countrey: wheare first thee sturdye Chorœbus By syr Peneleus was slayne, neere consecrat altar Of the Godesse Pallas: Ripheus lyke villenye suffred. A man too pietee, to iustice whoalye relying. So Gods ordayned thee chaunce. Lo oure coompanye slaughtred Both Dymas and Hypanis: nor thy devotion holye Could salue thee Panthus, nor crowne of blissed Apollo. You boans of Troians and houses flamed I wytnesse, In this last byckring I shrunck no danger or hazard, With Greeks encountring: and yf so fats had apoincted, My fist deserued my deeath. From thence we be tumbled Iphitus and Pelias iump with me. But Jphitus aged Dragd, and eke Pelias sore maymd with wound of Vlisses. To Priamus castel thee shout doth vs hastelye carrye: Heere was hoat assaulting, as thogh no skyrmish had els wheare Beene, ne yet a subiect Troian throgh cittye wear harmed. Thus we se Mars furiouse, thus Greeks euery harbory scaling, Upfretting the pilers, warding long wymbeled entryes. They clinge thee scalinges too wals, and vnder a sowgard They clymb, in lefthand, with shields, tools fellye rebating, With righthands grapling thee tops of turret ar holden. In valiant coombat thee Troians sturdye resisted. They pashe thee pallets of Greeks, and rumble a muster Of torne razte turrets, and for defensibil armoure Thee Greeks with rold stoans in last extremitye crusshed. And ritch gylt rafters, thee badge, thee glorius ensigne Of blood, thee Troians are straynd too scatter in hurling. Soom bands of Troians with weapons naked in entryes Ranck close too geather, thee Greeks most manlye repealing. Wee with al encoraged weare sturd too fortefye castel Of poore king Priamus, bringing fresh streingth to the vanquisht. Theare stood an od corner from vulgar companye singled, A posterne secret, to the castel Princelye belonging Andromachee the woful that passage traced had often Priuat, whilst Priamus kingdoom with saulftye remayned, Too graundsyre leading her yoong chield Astyanacta. Too the typ of turrets J ran, wheare feeblye the Troians Cleene tyrde, the assaultours, with weak force vaynely repulsed. Theare was a toure standing on a rock, that in altitud euened Thee stars, too seming (whence al thee Troian asemblye Was woont thee Greek fleet to behold, and customed armye) Wee that disioyncted; from stoans thee tymber a sunder Wee tearde, thee ioyncturs vnknit, with an horribil hurring Pat fals thee turret, thee Greeks with crash swash yt heapeth. Theyre rowme supply oothers; no kind of weapon is absent, Nor stoans, nor boans. Theare stood ek al furiouse with wrath dan Pyrrhus in entrye With brandisht weapons ruffling, in brasshaped armoure. Much lyke the owt peaking from weeds of poysoned adder, Whom nauil of boorrows in wynters season hath harbourd. His slougth vncasing, hym self now youthfulye bleacheth, His tayle smoog thirling, slyke breast to Titan vpheauing. With toonge three forcked furth spirts fyre freshlye regendred. Theare foght Syr Periphas, and coachman of old of Achilles Automedon named, soomtyme that guided his horses. With theese stout captayns thee youth of Scyria marched, They doe pres on forward, vp fire to the rafter is hurled. In person Pyrrhus with fast wroght twibbil in handling Downe beats with pealing thee doors, and post metal heaueth, Hudge beams hee brusteth, strong bars fast ioyncted he renteth. A broad gap yawning with theese great pusshes is opned, Where with thee chambers ar playne discoouered in ward. Now Priamus parlours, with long antiquitye nobled, Too the soa stand open, with large far gallerye stretched. Stronglye the first entry thee Troians garded in armoure. But the inner lodgins dyd shrille with clamorus howting, Too skyes swift climbing was sent thee terribil owtcrye. Then shiuering moothers throgh court doo wander agasted, Thee posts fast colling, the pilers moste hertelye bussing. With father his courradge his might dan Pyrrhus enhaunceth, No man, no morter can his onset forcibil hynder. With rip rap bouncing thee ram to the chapter is hurled, Postes al and parlours vp from foundation heauing. Pyks make thee passadge: and top syd turuye be turned Al thee Princelye thrasholds; thee Troians roundlye be murthred. No place or od corners of Greekish souldor ar emptye. Not so great a ruffling the riuer strong flasshye reteyneth Through the breach owt spurging, eke against bancks sturdely shogging It brayeth in snorting, throgh towns through countrye remouing Both stabil and oxen. There J saw in boucherye bathed Fyrye Neoptolemus, both breatherne lyncked Atridans. And Hecuba old Princesse dyd I se?, with number, an hundred Law daughters: Priamus with blood defiled his own fyre, That with his owne traueling too Gods hee setled on altars. Fiftye nephew striplings, and lemmans fiftye reteynd he. Now thee statelye pilers with gould of Barbarye fretted Are razde. Wheare flaming dooth cease, thear Greeks doe make hauock. Happlye what eende Priamus dyd make, now wyl be requyred. His foes old Priamus throgh court and cittye beholding On rusty shoulders sloa clapt his vnusual armoure, And bootelesse morglay to his sydes hee belted vnhable. His lif amydst the enymyes with foyne too finnish be myndeth. Jn medil of the palaice to skyes broad al open an altar Stood with greene laurel, throgh long antiquitye, shaded. Now to this hold Hecuba, and her daughters mourneful asembled In vayne for succoure gryping theyre mystical idols. Lyke dooues in tempest clinging fast closlye to geather. When shee saw Priamus yoouthlyk surcharged in armoure Shee sayd: What madnesse thee leads, vnfortunat husband, With theese mayls massiue to be clogd? Now whither I pray the? Our state eke and persons may not thus weaklye be shielded. No thogh my darling were present, courraged Hector. Heere pitch thy fortresse: let trust be reposed in altar: This shal vs al succour, or wee wyl ioynctlye be murthred. This sayd; her old husband in sacred seat she reposed. But se ye, from Pyrrhus scaping thee yoithlye Polytes, Soon too king Priamus, through thrusting forcibil armoure Rusht by long entreys, thee passadge blooddye begoaring. Hym quick dan Pyrrhus pursuing greedelye reatcheth. With the push and poaking of launce hee perceth his entrayls. In sight of thee soarye parents hee fel to the groundward, And liefe with the gushing bloodshed to the Gods he released. When that king Priamus dyd see this boucherye beastlye, Thogh that he were posting in fatal iournye to deaths doore Yeet this quick cholerick challenge hee could not abandon. Now for this tyrany, thee Gods (so that equitye raigneth And the loare of iustice) take, I pray theym, rightlye reuengment. In father his presence with spightful villenye cancred, Thee soon that murthrest, my sight with, boucherye stayning. Not so the right valeant (whose soon thwart feigned) Achilles Was to his foa Priamus, but laws of martial armes Tendring, dyd render too tumb thee carcas of Hector. And me to my kingdoom both gently and truely returned. The old man thus bawling, in streingth cleene weakned, here hurled His dart at Pyrrhus from the armoure feeblye rebounding, In bos of his target with flagging weakness yt hangeth. Whye then, quod Pyrrhus, thow shalt bee speedelye posted Too coast infernal, thear let my exployts be reported. My father aduertise, that J was ful truelye begotten, Baselye Neoptolemus was borne, that carrye for errand. This sayd, poore Priamus with force from the altar is haled, And then syr Pyrrhus with left hand grapled his hoarelocks, In the blud hym ducking of his owne soon, sellye Polytes. His blad he with thrusting in his old dwynd carcas vphilted. This was Prince Priamus last ende and desteny final, Who saw thee Troians vanquisht, thee cittye repressed. Empror of hudge, Asia, earst ruling with dignitye regal, In shoare nowe namelesse dooth ly lyke a trunchon al headlesse. This when J perceaued, with sensibil horror atached, My father Anchises heere with do J cal to remembraunce, Whilst I beheld Priamus thus gasping, my syre his adgemate, I beare eke in memory my wiefe left soalye Creüsa. And my house dispoyled, then I thinck on my soon Iülus. In this wise musing myn eye glaunst to my coompanye fensiue, I doe spye no Troian, for soom tyerde, tumbled al headlong Too ground, and diuerse were burnt with purposed offer. Thus then J left naked, by vestaes temple abyding False Helen, in lurcking manner close setled, J marcked. Thee flaming brightnesse from sight dooth darcknes abandon. This minion doubting thee Troians blooddye reuengment, And also fearing thee Greekish fyrie requital, Thee bane of vs Troians, of Greeks thee mak bate Erinnys, Formd her in a corner sneaking detested of altars. With choler inflaming J rest al restles in anger, With the death of the lady to requit my countrye repressed. To Mycen, or Spartans and shal she be saulfly returned? And after conquest as Queene with glorye to floorish? Her father, her palaces shal shee se, her children, her husband? With the knot of Troian matrons to her seruice alotted? Slayn lyes king Priamus: thee Troian cittye beskorched. Thee shoars of Dardan for her oft with bloodshed abounded. No suer, I may not such an horribil iniurye cancel. For to kil a wooman thogh no greate glorye be gleamed, Thogh valor and al honoure from suche weake victorye flitteth, Yeet to slea this fyrebrand, of al hurly burlye the foundresse, Must bee commended. My mynd eke further is eased Yf that of oure slaughters I shal bee partlye reuenged. And as I thus muttred, with roysting phrensye betraynted My moother, the Godesse (who was accustomed algats Eare this tyme present to be dusk) most brimlye dyd offer Her self to visadge, thee night with brightnes auoyding. Eeune lyk as her deitee to the Saincts dooth luster in heunblisse. Shee claspt my righthand, her sweet rose parlye thus adding. Soon to what od purpose thus meane ye to ruffle in anger? What maks you furious? wyl you care charye relinquish Of mee youre moother? Too post with speedines hoamward Too father Anchises were best: yf seallye Creüsa Or the lad Ascanius from murther saulflye be breathing. Theym Greeks assalting had kild, or turned in ashes Had not my deitee theyre streingth ouer highlye resisted. Not thee Greekish Helen (whose sight thy passion angrye Enkendleth) not fautye Paris this cittye represseth. This ruin ordeyned thee Gods and destenye froward. Looke (for J thee moysture whear with, now mortal, is hyndred Thy sight, doo bannish, thee darcknesse clowdye remoouing. See, that you doe folow youre moothers destinat order, What she the commaundeth to obserue, preciselye remember) Heere loa, whear heaps hudgy thow seest disioyncted a sunder And stoans dismembred from stoans, smooke foggye bedusted, Thee wals God Neptune, with mace threeforcked, vphurleth, And cleene theire ioyncturs from deepe foundation heaueth. And the Godesse Iuno ful fraight with pooysoned enuye Thee gates strong warding, furth from the nauye the Greek foas Dooth whoup, streight belted with steele. In tops of turrets see wheare Tritonia Pallas Is set, thee Troians killing with Gorgon his eyesight. Thee father of deitee thee Greeks dooth mightelye courradge: Through his procurement thee Gods thee cittye dishable. Flee, fle, my sweet darling, let toyls bee finnished hastly. Thow shalt bee shielded with my protection alway. J wil not fayle thee to tyme thow saulflye be setled. This sayd, with darcksoom night shade quite clowdye she vannisht. Grislye faces frouncing, eke agaynst Troy leaged in hatred Of Saincts soure deitees dyd I see. Then dyd J marck playnely thee castel of Ilion vplayd, And Troian buyldings quit topsy turuye remooued. Much lyk on a mountayn thee tree dry wythered oaken Sliest by the clowne Coridon rusticks with twibbil, or hatchet. Then the tre deepe minced, far chopt dooth terrifye swinckers, With menacing becking thee branches palsye before tyme, Vntil with sowghing yt grunts, as wounded in hacking. Al leingth with rounsefal, from stock vntruncked, yt harssheth. With Gods assistaunce downe from thee turret J lighted, Mye tools make passadge through flame and hostilitye Greekish. Too father Anchises old house thus saulflye retyred, Foorth with I dyd purpose from thence too desolat hiltops My syre too carry, but as I this matter had vttred, Too liue now longer, Troy burnt, hee flatlye reneaged; Or to dwel as bannisht. But, he sayd, you lustye iunent us In yeers and carcasse prime, quick and liuelye remayning Flee you. If Gods omnipotent my lief too linger had ordred They would theese lodgings haue fenst. Sufficeth yt also That Troians misery dyd J liue too testifye mourneful. Good syrs, bee packing, let my corps heere be reposed. My fist shal purchase my death, my foa mercye wyl offer For thee bootye fishing. Of graue to be voyded is harmelesse. Long my liefe I pampred, too Gods celestial yrksoom, Syth king of mankind, father of diuinitye total, With thundring lightnings, my carcasse stronglye beblasted. Theese woords expressing in one heast hee stieflye remayned Round fel J too weeping, with my spouse soarye Creüsa, With my soon Ascanius, with al eke thee sorroful houshold. Hym we al desyred too tame this desperat owtrage, Oure final slaghter not with such follye to purchase. Hee rested wylful lyk a wayward obstinat oldgrey. J then alarm shouted, too dy dyd J verelye purpose, For now what counsayl, what course may rightlye be taken? What? father Anchises, hold you my duitye so sclender, Too slip from Troytowne, and heere you soole to relinquish? From the fathers sermons shal such fond patcherye flicker? If Gods eternal thee last disseuered offal Of Troy determyn too burne, yf you father also Youre self too murther, too roote youre progenye purpose, Catch that catch may be, thee street gate to slaghter is open. From killing Priamus, dan Pyrrhus shortlye wyl hither, Thee soon fast bye the syre; thee syre that murthred at altars. Wasd for this (moother) that mee throgh danger vnharmed You led, now my enymyes to behold too riffle in hous seat? And my soon Ascanius, my syre, my seallye Creusa For to se deepe bathed, grooueling in bloods of eche oother? Nay then I beeshrew mee: make ye hast syrs: bring me myn armoure. Now for a last farewel do I take me to Greekish asembly. Soom Greeks shal find yt bitter, before al we be slaghtred. J girt my weapons to my syde, my tergat I setled On lift hand so rushing to the streets I posted in anger. But my feete embracing my pheere me in the entrye reteyned. Too father owtraging thee soon shee tendred Iulus. If to dye you purpose, take vs also in coompanye with you. If through experience soom trust ye doe settel in armoure First gard this dwelling, wheare rests thee childish Iulus, Wheare father is seated, where youre spouse named, is harbourd. Theese woords owt showting, with her howling the house she repl?nisht But look, on a suddeyn what chaunce most woonderus hapned Tweene father and moother thee yong boy setled Julus, A certeyn lightning on his headtop glistered harmelesse. His crisp locks frizeling, his temples prittelye stroaking. Heer with al in trembling with speede wee ruffled his hearebush, With water attempting thee flame too mortifye sacred. But father Anchises, mounting his sight to the skyward, Both the hands vplifting, hertly thus his orison vttred. Iuppiter omnipotent (yf that prayer annye the bendeth) Vs pitye, thy seruaunts, yf eke oght our godlines asketh, Graunt (father) Assista?ce this mirracle happye to stablish. Scant had he this finnisht, when that, with sudden, a thundring In the skye dyd rumble, foorth with theire flamed a blazing Star, streams owt shooting, yeelding of cleerenes abundaunce. Wee noted yt glyding from tops of mansion houseplace. Lastlye the star sincking in woods wyde of Jda was hydden, Right the waye furth poincting. Thee wood with brightnes apeereth. Eech path was fulsoom with sent of sulphurus orpyn. My father heere conquerd, hymself vp lustelye lifted. With the Godhead parling, he the star crinital adoreth. Now, quod he, no lingring, let vs hence, I am prest to be packing. Saulfe my prittye nephew, you Gods of countrye, my linnadge. You do manadge Troytowne; this is eke your prosperus omen. Now, my soon, on forward, thy syre is prest hastlye to track thee. Thus sayd he. Thee flaming to the townewals more nere aproched, And the flash of burning with skorching speedines hasted. Wel father in Gods name, mount on my shoulder, I pray you. This labor is pleasaunt, to me t'ys not payneful or yrcksoom. What luck shal betyde vs, wee wyl be in destenye partners, Or good hap, or froward: and let my young lad Julus Next be my companion, my wief may softlye pace after. Syrs, you thee seruaunts, slack not my woords to remember. A tumb to Troytowne and mouldy tempil ancereth Vowd to the godlye Ceres, a ciper by the churche seat abydeth By our old progenitours long tyme deuoutlye regarded. From diuerse corners to that hewt wee wyl make asemblye. Gripe, father, oure country deitees; se ye warelye keepe theym. For sith I with byckrings embrewd so blooddye my fingers, I may not, I dare not pollute Gods heaunlye, with handling, Until J with fountayn mee wash. When that I theese speeches deliuered, I twisted a wallet On my broad shoulders, my nape dyd J settle eke vnder, With lion his yellow darck skyn my carcase I cased. My father on shouldeers I set, my yoong lad Jülus I lead with righthand, tripping with pit pat vnequal, My wiefe cooms after, through crosse blynd allye we iumble. And I that in forenight was with no weapon agasted, And litel esteemed thee swarms of Greekish asemblye Now shiuer at shaddows, eeche pipling puf doth amaze me. For yong companion, for bedred burden abashed. Danger al escaping to the gats I saulflye repayred. Yeet not with standing a trampling sudden of hoat foot Soldours vs chased, to my thincking; my father also Casting eye backward cryed owt, soon flee, they doe track vs. J doe se theyre brandisht tergats, and brasshapen harneise. Now was J from policy fore cast with terror amooued, For whilst J wandred through streets and passages vncooth, My wief departed, my coomfort hertye Creüsa. Yf death her had goared, she behynd yf weerye remayned, Or strayed in foloing, I knew not truelye: but after Vnseene shee rested, nor backward skewd J myn eyesight, In graue of holye Ceres tyl that my burden I lighted. For shee was missing, when al our good coompanye clustred. With soon, with famely, with mee shee kept not apoinctment. Too Gods, too creaturs I belcht owt blasphemye bawling. For to me what mischief could chaunce in cittye more hurtful. My father Anchises, my chield I took to my seruaunts, And Gods of Troians were coucht in custodye secret. I to the towne turned close clad with burnished armoure, I was determind fully, too ventur al hazards, Al Troy too trauerse, too suffer danger al hapning. First dyd I coom backward to the wals, from whence I remooued, Too the gat J posted by night, and carefulye dogging Thee way with lightflams, eeche crooked corner I ransackt. Both with nightye silence was I quayld and greatlye with horror. Thence dyd I trudge hoamward, too learne yf she haplye returned. But theare weare the enymyes with thronging cluster asembled. Thee fyre heer on fretting with blaze too rafter is heaued. Thee flams surmounting tenements doo whize to the skyward. I ran too Priamus razd court, at castel J gazed, Jn cels and temple, that of old too Iuno was apted. As keeper Phœnix was made, with ruthles Ulisses Of booty and pillage. Theere Troian treasur is hurded, That flames escaped, thear stood the rich halloed altars. Theare massiue gould cups bee layd, theare wardrob abundant Of roabs most pretiouse, thear ar eke yoong children in order With cold hert moothers, for Greekish victorye quaking, Setled on al sydes. I stoutly emboldned with night shade raysed an howting, With mournful belling I namde expreslye, Creüsa. In vayne with sobbing was oft that od eccho repeated. In this guise frantyck as I ran throgh cittye with howling I noted on suddeyn the goast of verye Creüsa, And her woonted image, to me knowne, mad her elfish aparance. Heere with I was daunted, my hear stard, and speechles I stutted. Then to me thus speaking, my carck in search she remooued. This labor, ô husband, too no great purpose auayleth, For this hap is chaunced bye the Gods prefixed apoinctment. Hence yt is vnlawful with you too carrye Creüsa. That trauayl is shortned by the king of sacred Olympus. Thow must with surges bee bangd and pilgrimage yrcksoom. In land Hesperian thow shalt bee saulflye receaued, Wheare glydes throgh cornefilds, with streaming secrecye, Tybris. Theare doe lye great kingdooms, and Queene most Princelye bespoken For the, mye kind husband for mee grief therefor abandon. Now me the Myrmidones for captiue prisoner hold not, Nor sterne snuff Dolopans, and Greekish matron I serue not, Of Venus in wedlock thee daughter. Of Gods thee moother me in this my countrye reteyneth. Fare ye wel, ô husband, oure yoong babye charely tender. This sayd, shee vannisht, and thogh that I sadlye requyred, Too confer further, yeet shee too tarrye renounced. Thryce dyd I theare coouet, to col, to clasp her in armes. Thryce then thee spirit my catching swiftlye refused. Much lyk to a pufwynd, or nap that vannished hastlye. Thee twylight twinckled, furth I to my coompanye posted. Whear soone I perceiued with woonder a multitud hudgye. Of men with woomen too this layre newlye repayred. Thee yoonger Troians, thee meaner wretched asemblye Round to me dyd cluster, with purse and person abyding Prest, throgh surgye waters with mee too seek ther auenturs. Lucifer owtpeaking in tips of mounted hil Ida On draws thee dawning. Thee Greeks with custodye watchful, Warded thee towngats, hoap here of no succor abydeth. J shrunck, and my father to the crowne of mounten J lifted. Finis libri secundi. THEE THIRD BOOKE OF VIRGIL HIS ÆNEIS. When giltlesse Asian kingdoom sterne destenye quasshed, With Priamus country when squysd was the Jlian empyre, When Troy was razed, quight from foundation hoysed: Furth to run exiled, too seeke soom forren auentures, By Gods we are warned. Wee rigd our nauye flat vnder Haut hil of Antander, not far from mounten of Ida. Then we wer vncerteyn too what saulf soyle to betake vs. Men to vs thick crouded: scant was prime summer aproched, When father Anchises to the seas thee coompanye charged. I, salt tears shedding, my natiue countrye relinquisht, Thee roads and platfourms where Troy stood: sad to the seaward With my companions and with my yoong son Jülus With Gods, mightye patrons, my course and passage J bended. A large wyld region theare stands, Mauortia cleaped, Thracia sum terme yt: theare raignd thee bluddye Lycurgus: Thee Troian leage seat, with fastned freendship abyding Whilst fortune floated. With crosse blast thither J sayled, On shore eke I founded townewals, by destenye lucklesse: Of my name, Æneidans dwellers, theare setled, J named. Too Venus and the sacred remnaunt of thee holye triumphaunts J framd a sacrifice, the begun wurck lucklye toe prosper, And toe Ioue omnipotent a bul neere seaside I slaughtred. A tumb theare rested by chaunce close shaded al vpward With twigs thick crumpled, with myrtel mossye thear edging. I drew neere, mynding too roote fro cel earthye the thicket, With thee slips greenish too deck thee new shaped altars. I viewd with wundring a grisly monsterus hazard. For the tre supplanted, that first fro the roote seat is haled, With drop drop trilling of swart blud filtred abundance. Thee ground black steyning: then furth with a quiuerish horror My ioyncts child ransackt, my blud with terror apaling. At the secund pulling, when an oother wicker is vp pluckt. Thearbye the whole matter furth with more deepelye to ferret, From that stub lykewise foorth spirt drops bluddelye stilling. With this hap entangled, thee sweete Nymphs rural J woorshipt, And God Mars the Regent of that soyle crabbed adoring, Too turne too goodnesse this sight and merciles omen. But when I thee third tyme with grype more fiercelye dyd offer, Ny knees fast pitching on sands, too pluck vp an oother: (What? shal I chat further? from speeche shal secrecye bar mee?) From pits deepe bottoom dooth skritche a woonderus howling, With playnts most pitiful to oure ears thus sadlye rebounding. Woorthye syr Æneas, why with this boutcherye teare you A caytiefe forlorne? Extend your mercye to deadfolck. Foule not your sacred hands: you rack no forrener owtcast, You rent a Troian: theese drops from shrubs doe not issue. Oh, flee this Canibal country, this coouetus Island. I am namd syr Polydor: with darts fel nayled heer vnder J lodge: which thicket thus growne me terriblye stingeth. I stud al astonyed, my hear starde, and speechles J rested. This Polydor whillon with pure gould mightelye loaden, Preeuelye by Priamus, thee Troian rector vnhappye, Too king Treicius was sent, to be charelye noozeld. But when this gardein perceu'd the aduersitye Troian, And that theyre citty thee Grecian armye besieged, Hee leaues thee conquourd, and clingd to the partye triumphant. Al trust fowlye breaking, thee poore Polydorus is headlesse Through wycked murther, thee gould thee traytor vp hurdeth. What feat or endeuours of gould thow consecrat hungar Mens mynds constrainst not with wyels or vertue to coompasse. When that J tooke courradge, when pangs al feareful I bannisht, I told thee chiefteyns, and namelye mye good father adged This strange aduenture, theyre iudgements also requyring. Swiftlye they determind too flee from a countrye so wycked, Paltocks Jnne leauing, too wrinche thee nauye too southward. For polydor wee framd an obit: wee tumbled in heapwise Of stoans a cluster, with black weede the altar is hanged, With tree swartye Cipers: Troy dames with customed vsadge Trol round, downe tracing with theyre discheaueled hearlocks. Wee pourd mylck luke warme foaming, and blud sacred after. With mayne noise lifted to the slayne soule lastlye we shouted. When soft gale sootherne and calme seas saulftye dyd offer, My mates lancht forward theyre fleete, from shoare we be glyding, Thee roads, thee countrey, thee towns fro oure nauye be gadding. In the myd of the searowme theare stands a plentiful Island Too thee dame of myrmayds, too Neptune Princelye relying. This was roundlye bayed (for so the Ioue heunlye dyd order) With Mycone, and eke with Giarus, two famosed Islands. Theare resting habitants no wynd flaws stormye regarded. Too this Ile I sayled, wee saulflye dyd harbor in hauen. When we were al landed, we the cittye of Phœbus adored. King Anius, king of the habitants, and priest of Apollo, Crownd with fresh garland, with laurels consecrat headband, Glad met vs, also knowing Anchises adged, his old freend. Theare we shake hands kyndly, foorth with we are setled in hostrye. In the old buylt tempil thus thee God Phœbus I woorshipt. Soombye place of resting graunt vs, most sacred Apollo, Yeeld wals too vs wery, soom stock, soom towne for abyding, Saulue the secund Troytowne, thee scraaps of wrathful Achilles, Of Greeks thee rellicks; by what king shal we be ruled? What man is oure captayne? Too what soyle worldlye to iourney, Thow doost commaund vs? where shal we be lastlye reposed? Shew father a prophecy; poure downe thye good oracle heunly. Scant had I thus spoken, when seats al quiuered about vs. Thee doors, thee laurel, thee mount with terribil earth quake Doo totter shiuering, with rumbling mutterus eccho. Then to vs squat grooueling in this wise the oracle aunswerd. You brawnd hard Troians, what soyle youre auncetrye seised First of al old countreys, to the same you shal be reduced. Track owt youre moother, whom long antiquytye graunted. With seed of Æneas shal coompasse earthlye be ruled. His soons soons and soons from theire braue progenye springing. Thus God Apollo cryed: but wee with an vnison owtcrye, And with iollye tumult, where should that cittye be setled Streight ways demaunded, what place God Phœbus apoincted, My father Anchises up al old antiquitye ripping, Heare me, quod hee, lordinges, lerne the expectation hoaped. Thee Creet Ile in mydseas dooth stand too Iuppiter hallowd: Theare mount Ide resteth, thee springe of progenye Troian. A fruictful kingdoam, with towns in number an hundred. Hence our progenitour (so I fayle not in historye told mee) Surnamed Teucrus first came too Rhetean Island. Theare picht he his kingdoom, for then Troy cittye was unbuylt, And castels stood not, the habitans in vallye remayned. Theare dwelt dame Cybele in forrest of desolat Ida. And moonewise Coribants on brasse their od harmonye tinckling. Thence cooms trustye silence vsd in sollemnitye sacred. And two stately lyons this fine dams gilt wagon haled. Wisely let vs thearefor too Gods direction harcken: Let wynds bee swadged foorth with, too Candye be packing. Short is thee passadge (so that oure God Iuppiter help vs) Jn three days sayling wee shal too Candye be puffed. This discourse eended, too the altars holye returning, A Bul too Neptune, wyth a bul too golden Apollo, Hee lykewise slaughtred too roaring wynter a blackbeast, But to the sweet west wynd a best whit lillye was offred. Theare fleeth a rumoure, that king of Candye relinquisht His seat, that the Island is left vnfurnished holye. Wee left Ortigian countrey, with nauye we passed By mounts of Nazon too skincking Bacchus alotted. From thence wee trauayled to the greenedeckt gaylye Donysa: To Oleoron, too lillye Paron, to the Cyclades also Dispersd and scatterd, and neere creeks sundrye we sayled. Thee thick skyn mariners shouted with sudden agreement. My maats assented to bend too Candye the passadge. Thee wynd puft forward with sweete gale freelye the nauye: At leingth by sayling on land of Candye we lighted. First then at oure landing towne wals I ther hastelye founded. Pergamea I caldyt, that names they gladlye receaued. By me they were counsayld too buyld vp sumptuus houses. Also bye this season too docks oure nauye was haled. Thee youth too wedlock and tylladge thriftelye clustred. Both laws and tenements I framd. But streight on a suddein A plagye boch ranged, with foule contagion ayrye Both bodyes festring and fruict trees plentiful harming. A yeere too dismal. For sweete lief swiftlye was eended, Thee fields cleene fruictlesse thee dogstar Sirius heated. Thee flours wax withred, thee soyle fruicts plentye renegeth. My father exhorted too turne too sacred Apollo, For toe craue our pardon, when should this iournye be finnisht, Or trauail expyred, by what means might we be furthred. Thee night his mantel dooth spred: with slumber is holden Eche liuing creature, then my holye domestical housgods, Jn last nights fyrebroyls, that from Troy skorched I saulued, Jn glistred shyning in a dreame toe me made thear aparaunce. Iump at thee wyndoors, where moonshyne brimlye dyd enter. Thus to me they parled, shredding of sorroful anguish. Syr, to ye what soothsay to record dooth purpose Apollo, Heere that he dischargeth: we be sent too signify his errand Wee skapte from Troybrands bye thye courradge manfulye shielded And bye thye good guiding through seaplash stormye we marched. Wee thee same pilgrims wyl yeeld to thye progenye glorye, And rule too citty. Let towne wals mightye be raised Streight by the for mighty persons: let no reason hold thee From flight: this countrey must bee forsaken: Apollo Ment not, in his prophecy, thy course too Candye to further. Theare stands a region, by Greeks yt is Hesperye named, A stout old countrey, with plenty fertil abounding. Theare dwelt th' Ænotrians, but now by the coompanye yonger Of thee first captayn valiaunt, yt is Italye termed: Oure seat thear resteth: theare borne was Dardanus adged, And father Jasius: from whence oure auncetrye sprouted. Wherefor in al gladnesse to thyne old sire certifye tydings: Skud to soyl Jtalian, from Candye the Juppiter haleth. With theese Gods gingling, with fight moste geason apaled, (For to mye ful seeming with slumber I was not atached I knew theire tucktlocks, I knew theire phisnomye present A cold sweat saltish through my ioynctes fiercely dyd enter) From my bed I started: to the sky with meeknes I lifted My hands deuoutlye praying, then too my fortunat housgods J framd a sacrifice: next with ioy tickled I posted Too my syre Anchises: and told thee matter in order. Hee noted his stumbling to haue coom from the auncetrye doubtful, And dubil acceptaunce of syers to haue fostred his erroure. O my son Æneas, with Troian destenye toughned, Thee self same prophecy too mee Cassandra recited: Now cal I too memory that shee this countrye remembred, Often at Hesperian regions, and Italye glauncing. But to soyl Hesperian that Troymen should be remooued, What wight coniecturde? who would Cassandra then harcken? Accept wee therefor this course, and credit Apollo. Thus sayd: we assented to his lore with cheereful obeysaunce. Wee leaue Creete country; and our sayls unwrapped vphoysing, With woodden vessel thee rough seas deepelye we furrowe. When we fro land harbours too mayne seas gyddye dyd enter Voyded of al coast sight with wild fluds roundlye bebayed, A watrye clowd gloomming, ful abooue mee clampred, apeered, A sharp storme menacing, from sight beams soonnye reiecting: Thee flaws with rumbling, thee wroght fluds angrye doe iumble: Vp swel thee surges, in chausse sea plashye we tumble: With the rayn, is daylight through darcknesse moystye bewrapped, And thundring lightbolts from torneclowds fyrye be flasshing. Wee doe mis oure passadge through fel fluds boysterus erring, Oure pilot eke, Palinure, through dymnesse clowdye bedusked In poinccts of coompasse dooth stray with palpabil erroure. Three dayes in darcknesse from bright beams soonny repealed, And three nights parted from lightning starrye we wandred. Thee fourth day foloing thee shoare, neere setled, apeered And hils vppeaking; and smoak swift steamd to the skyward. Oure sayls are strucken, we roa furth with speedines hastye, And the sea by our mariners with the oars cleene canted is harrowd On shoars of strophades from storme escaped J landed, For those plats Strophades in languadge Greekish ar highted, With the sea coucht Islands. Where foule bird foggye Celœno And Harpy is nestled: sence franckling Phines his bousroume From theym was sunderd, and fragments plentye remooued. No plage more perilous, no monster grislye more ouglye, No stigian vengaunce lyke too theese carmoran haggards. Theese fouls lyke maydens are pynde with phisnomye palish; With ramd cramd garbadge, theire gorges draftye be gulled, With tallants prowling, theire face wan withred in hunger, With famin vpsoaken. When tward theese Islands oure ships wee setled in hauen, Neere, we viewd, grasing heards of bigge franckye fat oxen, And goats'eke cropping carelesse, not garded of heerdman. Wee rusht with weapons, parte of thee bootye we lotted First to Ioue. On banck syds our selues with food we reposed. But loa with a suddeyn flushing thee gulligut harpeys From mountayns flitter, with gagling whirlerye flapping Theyr wings: furth the viand fro tabils al greedelye snatching, With fulsoom sauour, with stincking poysoned ordure Thee ground they smeared, theartoo skriches harshye reioyning. Then we set al the tabils, and fyrde oure mystical altars Vnder a rock arched, with trees thick coouered ouer. At the secund sitting from parcels sundrye repayred This coouir avenouse, and swift with a desperat onset, They gripte in tallants the meat and furth spourged a stincking Foule carrayne sauoure: then I wild thee coompanye present, Too take theire weapons, and fight with mischeuus howlets. My wyl at a beckning is doon, they doe run to ther armoure In grasse theyre flachets, and tergats warelye pitching. But when at a thurd flight theese fowls to the coompanye neered, With shril brasse trumpet Misenus sowned alarum. Oure men marcht forward, and fierce gaue a martial vncoth Charge, theese strange vulturs with skirmish bluddye to mayster. But strokes theire feathers pearsd not, nor carcases harmed: And toe skye they soared, thee victals clammye behynd theym, They do leaue haulf mangled with sent vnsauerye bepoudred. On the typ of rockish turret stood gastlye Celœno. Vnlucky prophetesse; and thus she recounted her errand. And now Syr Troians, wyl you for slaughter of oxen And for al our owne good wage war with sellye poore harpeys? And vs from kingdoom bannish? Then take me this errand: And what I shal prophecy with tentiue listenes harcken, What Ioue too Phœbus, too me also what vttred Apollo. I the chiefe hel fyrebrand of fel furye mischeuus holden Wyl now discoouer thee self same mysterye told mee. Italye you long for, to the land eke of Italye saulflye You shal bee guided with winds, and setled in hauen. Yeet not with standing ere conquerd cittye be rampyrde, For this youre trespas you shal be so gaunted in hunger, That youre smeary tabils you wyl most greedelye swallow. Thus she sayd: and forward to the wood shee flickered hastlye. At this hap oure feloes with feareful phantasye daunted, Stood stil al astonied with cold blud, lyke gelu, quiuering. They doe quayl in courradge, and with no martial armoure, But by ther holye prayers they doe practise peaceful atoanement. If godesesse, yf byrds stinking, or bugs they resembled. But father Anchises his palms from strond plat inhauncing On Gods heunlye cryeth, to ther hest with duitye relying: Gods, quod he, this messadge turne you to a prosperus omen. Cancel theese menacing soothings, thee godlye reseruing. Thus sayd: swift we weyed the anchors, and sayles vphoysed, With northen bluster through fome seas speedelye flitting, As the gale and the pilot with steering skylful vs haleth. Jn midil of the sea deepe wee saw thee wooddye Zacynthos, Dulichium, Samee, with cragged Neritos hard stond. Wee fle the rocks of Ithack, and coast of Princelye Laërtes, Also we the byrth place detest of flinted Ulisses. Thee mount Leucates with thick clowds gloommye bedawbed Vp peaks to the viewing, with feareful pionct of Apollo. Theare we were enshoared quight tyrde, and on to the borrough As we gad, oure vessels vpdrawne are grapled at anchor. Theare we being landed saulfly through fortun vnhoaped, Too Ioue wee sacrifice, sundry hostes are flamed on altars, And Troian pastymes wee practise in Actean Jsland. Soom feloes naked with larding smearye bebasted, With wrastling gambalds for price, for maystrye doe struggle Myrrye for escaping thee towns and Grecian hamlets, Through theire deadly foes theire passage luckye recounting: Thee whilst fayre Phœbus thee yeers course roundlye reuolued, And seas, with north blast and wynter frostye, be roughned: A brasen hudge tergat, that Abans erst fenced in armoure, On post J nayled, thee clingde shield this posye beareth. This Signe AEneas From Grekish Conqueror Haled. J gaue commaundment fro the port to the ships to be packing. My maats skum the seafroth there in oars strong cherelye dipping. Thee Pheacan turrets foorth with from sight we relinquish. Wee coast Epëirus, thence wee touche Chaon his hauen. And to the great burrough of But throt statelye we skudded. Heere, loa, throgh oure hyring a report incredibil, vncoth, Glides, that Prince Helenus, by Troian lineal ofspring Soon too king Priamus, this Greekish countrye reteyneth. Thee pheere possessing and crowne of Pyrrhus his empyre, Also that Andromachee dooth bed with a countrye man husband. Theese news mee mazing, my mynd was greedelye whetned, Too parle with the Regent, too lerne this meruelus hapning. J stept from the hauen, leauing my nauye behynd mee. Happelye that season soom banckets costlye, with oother Lamenting presents (in shade to the cittye reioyning Neere water of Simois both deepely and warelye sliding) Andromachee framed to the dust, on tumb eke of Hector Calling with burial yelling, that al emptye remayned: With greene turf circled; from thence right on she repayred, For cause of further mourning, too consecrat altars. When she dyd espy mee posting, and Troiecal armoure Too too gyddye viewd, with vnordinat extasis hamperd, Downe she fel on suddeyn, thee cold too carcas aprocheth: She sowns, and after long pausing thus she sayd elflyke. Is thye true playne visadge with tru shape natural offred? Imp of a statelye Godesse bringst thou to me verelye tydings? Art thow yeet liuing? or they flight worldlye relinquisht, Tel me where is my husband, my sweeting delicat Hector? Thus sayd: al in blubbring shee floath, with clamorus howling Thee place shee tinckled: but I through pangs vncoth vnhabled, With stutting stamering at leingth thus fumbled an aunswer. I doe, liue, I assure thee, thogh dangers sundrye me taynted, Doubt ye not, a changling ye se none. Lord what good fortune thee lack of pristinat husband Hath toe thye contentment with new match luckye releeued? Possesseth Pyrrhus thee spouse of famosed Hector? Downe she smote her visadge, to me thus ful smoothlye replying. ô Priamus daughter, thee virgin Princelye, thrise happye Thow that by thye foes neere Troy wals slaughtered hast beene. By this hap escaping thee filth of lottarye carnal. Too couche not mounting of mayster vanquisher hoat spur. But we, by crosse passadge from flamed countrye remoued, Thee pryde of a stripling and ymp of wrathful Achilles Haue borne with thraldoom, with sharp captiuitye fetterd, Hee to fyne Hermionee, for Greeks abootye to peerelesse, Daughter too Queene Helen, fast and hoat phantasye bended. Me his nyefe to his serua?nt Helenus ful firmelye betroathed. But yeet vnexspected with ialosye kendled Orestes For los of his beadmate, dyd take too tardye my mayster, Hym by his syers altars killing with skarboro warning. When fro Neoptolemus thee vital spirit abated This part was to Helenüs by wylled parcerye lotted: Chaönian countreys of Troian Chaon ycleaped: This towne Troy citty, this castel eke Ilion highting. But to the what passadge thee winds and fortun alotted? Or what great deity tost thee to our desolat angle? How faers Ascanius? doth he liue, and breathful abydeth? Whom to the now Troytowne. Dooth the los of moother to the chielde bring sorreful anguish? Are sparcks of courradge in this yong progeny kendled By father Æneas, with his vncle martial Hector? Theese toyes shee pratled mourning, griefs newlye refreshing Thee whilst king Helenus, with a crowding coompanye garded, From towne to vs buskling vs as his freends freendlye bewelcomd. Vs to his new citty with curtesye cheereful he leadeth; With tears rief trickling saucing eeche question asked, J march on forward: and yoong Troy finelye resembling Thee big huge old monument, and newbrooke Zanthus I knowledge. With the petit townegats fauoring thee principal old portes. Also mye companions in country cittye be frollickt: In toe the verye palaice thee Prince theym wholye receaueth. With whip cat bowling they kept a myrry carousing, Thee goulden mazurs vp skynckt for a bon viage hoysing. There we dyd al sotourne two dayes: then a prosperus hizling Of south blast, puffing on sayles dooth summon vs onward. Too thee Princely prophet thus I spake, hym freendlye requesting. O sacred Troian, thee light of misterye darckned, Of Gods thee spooks mate, thee truchman of hallod Apollo: By the God enstructed by stars for to ominat eeche thing, By flight and chirping byrds too prognosticat aptlye: Poure foorth thy prophecy (for too mee prosperus hazards Eeche sound relligion foretold, mee to Italye posting, Only on displeasaunt foule shapte byrd, the Harpye Celæno (Forwarns much mischiefe too coom with dangerus hunger) In theese stormye perils too what saulf porte shal I take mee? King Helenus slaughtring, with woont accustomed heyfers, Peace craues of the Godhead, from front thee label vnhanging, Mee, by the hand, trembling hee leads to thye mysterye Phoœbus) Thee priest this prophecy from Gods direction opned. Thow soon of holye Venus (for th'art by setled apoinctment Of Gods mightye power to exployts most doughtye reserued. Thus thy fate establisht dooth rest, so thye fortun is ordred) Of poincts sundrye wyl I to the shape but a curtal abridgment, Too the eende in thye trauayl thow mayst the more heedlye be lessond, And passe to Italian region, thus shortlye rehersing Peece meale prittye parings: for, too tel a summarye total, Thee fat's king Helenus dooc bar, with Iuno the Saturne. Wheare thow supposest therefor, that here Italye fast by Dooth stand, and myndest too sayl with speede to that hauen: With draw thy iudgment from that grosse cosmical erroure. Italy is hence parted by long crosse dangerus inpaths. In flud Trinacrian thy great oars must deeplye be bathed, And the sea rough wurcking must eeke with nauye be trauerst, And Circes Jsland se ye must with Limbo lake hellish: Ere ye shal in saulf land of a nobil cittye be founder. Glaunce I wyl at certeyn tokens, be ye watch ful in harckning. When ye shal in secret with care neere fresh water happen, Too spye bye thee banck syeds a strange sow mightelye sized, Coompased alroundly with sucklings thirtye to number, White, with lillye colours fayre dect, shee shal be reposed On ground, dug dieting her mylckwhit farroed hoglings. Heere shall cease thye labours: heere shal thy cittye be buylded. Feare not thee manging fortold of burd seat in hunger, Thee fats thee passage shal smooth, yea goulden Apollo, If ye wyl hym summon, shal bee too the furth readye coomming. But this neere setled country (that of Italy is holden Parcel) see ye shun yt: for theare Greeks yreful ar harbourd. Heere the man of Locrus mounted steepe statelye the townwals, And fields of Salent with trouping clustered armye Lyctius Idomeneus dooth keepe: so duke Melibœus Holds thee prittye Petil round coompast strong bye Philoctect. Also when in saulfty from seas thy nauye shal harboure, When rites relligious thow vowest on new shaped altars, With purple vesture bee deckt, with purpil eke hooded, Least that in aduauncing thee Gods with fyrye cole heating, Soom dismal visadge foorth peake thee mysterye marring. Thow with thy feloes obserue this customed order. And bye thye posterytee let theese rites duelye be foostred. With winds neere to Sicil when that thy nauye shal enter, And strayts shal be opned neere craggy unweildye Pelorus, With lifthand sayling to the lift syde countrye be packing: What stands on right syde both land and channel abandon. Theese shoars were sundred by the plash breache, fame so doth vtter, (So things transitory by lengthned season ar eaten) For when theese countryes were grapled ioinctlye to geather, Swift the sea with plashing rusht in, townes terreblye drenching, Jtalye disioyncting with short streicts from Sicil Island, Scylla doth on right syde rough stand, and deadlye Charybdis On left hand swelleth with broad iaws greedelye galping, In to gut vp souping three tymes thee flash water angrye, From paunch alsoe spuing toe the sky the plash hastlye receaued. But Scylla in cabbans with sneaking treacherye lurcketh, Close and slilye spying, too flirt thee nauye to rock bane. A man in her visadge, then a virgin fayre she resembleth Downe to her gastlye nauel, lyke a whale from thee belye seeming. Monsterus, vnseemely, then a tayle lyke a dolphin is added Iumbled vp of sauadge fel woulfs, with grislye lol hanging. It wyl bee saulfer too passe thee countrye Pachynus, With leasure lingring, and far streicts crabbye to circle, Than to be surprised by Scylla in dungeon hellish. Whear curs barck bawling, with yolp yalpe snarrye rebounding. Also ys king Helenus bee now for a truprophet holden, If fayth beere resiaunt, yf trouth to hym graunteth Apollo: Thow soon of heunlye Godesse, this poinct I chieflye shal vtter, And besyde al warnings estsoons yt must be repeated: Let Iunoes deitee with duitye be woorshiped humble. Vnto her frame thy prayers, let mystresse might ye be vanquisht With meekned presents, and then lyke a conqueror happye From land Trinacrian thow shalt bee to Italye posted. When ye in this passadge too Cumas cittye shall enter, And lake with rumbling forrest of sacred Auerna, Abraynsick propetesse se ye shal, whom dungeon holdeth In ground deepe riueted, future haps and destenye chaunting. But yeet al her prophecyes in greene leaues nicelye be scribled, Jn theese slipprye leaues what sooth thee virgin auerreth, Shee frams in Poëtry: her verses in dungeon howsing, They keepe rancks ordred, with aray first setled abyding: But when on a suddeyn thee doors winds blastye doe batter, And theese leaues greenish with whisking lightlye be scatterd, Neauer dooth she laboure to reuoke her flittered issue, Or to place in cabban, theire floane lyms frehshlye reioyning. Thus they fle, detesting thee lodge of giddye Sibylla: Heere for a spirt linger, no good opportunitye scaping. (Although thee to seaward thy posting coompanye calleth, And winds vaunce fully thy sayls with prosperus buffing) Post to this prophetesse, let her help and sooth be required. Shee wyl geeue notice to the streight of al Italye dwellers: How thow wiselye trauayls shalt shun, shalt manfulye suffer. Theare she wyl enstruct thee, thy passadge fortunat ayding. Theese be such od caueats, as I to the freendlye can vtter. Foorth: and with thy valor let Troian glorye be mounted. When this Princely prophet this counsayl faythful had eended, Hee wyls that presents of gould, ful weightelye poysing, Bee broght to our vessels, and there with eke iuorye pullisht: Plentye great of siluer with plate most sumptuus adding. And a shirt mayled with gould, with acrested vp helmet. Latelye Neoptolemus possest this martial armoure. My father Anchises rich presents alsoe receaueth. Horses eke and captayns are sent. And oars to oure vessels bee broght and weapon abundante. Thee whilst Anchises wyls that thee nauye be launched, Least that in oure loytring oure passadge lucky wer hindred. Hym prophet of Phœbus dooth treat with dignitye peerelesse. Anchises, whom statelye Venus tak's woorthye for husband, Thee charge of deitee, now twise from Troy ruin haled, Italye see yoonder: thither with nauye be squdding. How beyt theese parcels in sayling must be refused, Seeke the far and distant country declard of Apollo. Fare ye wel, happye parent of a soon so worthye; what oght els Should I say? what maks mee this gale so fortunat hynder? Also good Andromachee, with last departur al heauye, Presented vestures of gould most ritchlye bebroyded. And my lad Ascanius with a Troian mantel adorning, Weau'd wurcks thwackt with honor, to her gifts this parlye she licketh. Take, myeboy, theese tokens by myn owne hands finnished holye. Let these of Andromachee thee good wyl testifye lasting. Cherrish theese presents by the pheere to the tendred of Hector. O next Astianax thee type by me chieflye belooued, Jn visadge, looking, eke in hands thee fullye resembling. Who had ben, yf hee liued, for yeers now youthlye thine equal. J for a long farewel this sonnet sorroful vttred. Rest ye stil heere blessed, that now youre fortun haue eended: Wee to future mischiefe from formoure danger ar hurled. You rest in fre quiet, thee seas you need not vpharrow. You reck not, to trauayle, that back goeth, Italye serching. Heere the image of Zanthus ye behold, and prittye Troy buylded By youre Princelye labours, and too this new shaped engyn Thee Gods send fortune, fro assaultes too fortifye Greekish. If that I too Tybris with neere but countrye shal enter, And that I shal fortune to behold thee towne by me founded: Italye with the Epeire, too both king Dardanus author, Shal be knit in freendship, making of two pepil one Troy. This leage eke of feloship shal bee manteyned of issue. Foorth we goa too the seaward, wee sayle bye Ceraunia swiftly. Wheare too ioynctlye mearing a cantel of Italye neereth. Thee whilste thee sunbeams are maskt, hyls darcklye be muffled: Wee be put hard ioygning to the boosom of countrye requyred. Oure selfs wee cherisht, oure members slumber atached. Not yeet was mydnight ouerhyed, when that Palinurus, From bed nimblye fleeth, too se in what quarter yt huffeth: How stands thee wind blast, with listning tentiue he marcketh, Thee lights starrye noting in globe celestial hanging: Thee seun stars stormy, twise told thee plowstar, eke Arcture, Also sad Orion, with goulden flachet, in armoure. When that he perceaued, thee coast to be cleere, then he summond Oure men too shipboord, thee camp wee swiftlye remooued. Foorth we take oure passadge, oure sayles ful winged vp hoysting. Thee stars are darckned, glittring Aurora reshined. Wee doe se swart mountayns, we doe gaze eke at Italye dymmed. Italye loa yoonder, first, Italye, showted Achates. Jtalye, land naming, lykewise thee coompanye greeted. Then father Anchises a goold boul massye becrowning, With wyne brym charged, thee Gods celestial hayleth, Jn ship thus speaking. You Gods, of sayling, of land stats mightye remayning, Graunt to vs milde passadge, and tempest mollifye roughning. Sweete gales are breathing, and porte neere seated apeereth: Jn the typ of mountayne thee temple of hautye Minerua Glad we spye: thee mariners strike sayles, and roa to the shoareward. The hauen from the eastcoast, in bowewise, crooked apereth. Thee rocks sternelye facing with salt fluds spumye be drumming. Downe the road is lurcking, yeet two peers loftye run vpward From stoans lyke turrets: fro the shoare thee tempil auoydeth. Heere for a first omen fowre fayre steeds snow whit I marcked, Thee pasture shredding in fields: this countrye doth offer, Quod father Anchises, garboyls, so doe signifye war steeds. Yeet stay: the self horses in waynes erst ioinctlye were hooked, Al-yoked, and matchlyke teamed with common agreement. This loa, quod hee bringeth firme hoape for peaceable vsadge. Then we honored Pallas, that graunted a luckye beginning: Also before the altars oure heads with purpilar hooded, In Troy rites, Helenus faythful direction holding. And with setled honor thee Greekish Iuno we woorshipt. Heere we doe not lynger; thee vowd sollemnitye finnisht, Vp we gad, owt spredding oure sayls and make to the seaward: Al creeks mistrustful with Greekish countrye refusing. Hercules his dwelling (yf bruite bee truelye reported) Wee se, T arent named, to which heunlye Lacinia fronteth, And Caulons castels we doe spy, with Scylla the wreckmake. Then far of vplandish we doe view thee fyerd Sicil Ætna. And a seabelch grounting on rough rocks rapfulye frapping Was hard; with ramping bounce clapping neer to the seacoast Fierce the waters ruffle, thee sands with wroght flud ar hoysed. Quod father Anchises, heere loa that scuruye Charybdis. Theese stoans king Helenus, theese ragd rocks rustye fore vttred. Hence hye, mye deere feloes, duck the oars, and stick to the tacklings. Thus sayd he, then swiftly this his heast thee coompanye practise. First thee pilot Palinure thee steerd ship wrigs to the lifthand. Right so to thee same boord thee maysters al wrye the vessels. Up we fle too skyward with wild fluds hautye, then vnder Wee duck too bottom with waues contrarye repressed. Thus thrise in oure diuing thee rocks moste horribly roared: And thrise in oure mounting to the stars thee surges vs heaued. Thee winds and soonbeams vs, poore souls weerye, refused, And to soyl of Cyclops with wandring iournye we roamed. A large roade fenced from rough ventositye blustring. But neere ioynctlye brayeth with rufflerye rumboled Ætna. Soomtyme owt yt balcketh from bulck clowds grimlye bedymmed. Lyke fyerd pitche skorching, or flash flame sulphurus heating: Flownce to the stars towring thee fire, lyke a pelles, is hurled, Ragd rocks vp raking: and guts of mounten yrented From roote vp hee iogleth: stoans hudge slag molten he rowseth: With route snort grumbling, in bottom flash furye kendling. Men say that Enceladus with bolt haulf blasted here harbrouth, Dingd with this squising and massiue burthen of Ætna, Which pres on hym nayled from broached chymnye stil heateth. As oft as the giant his broyld syds croompeled altreth, So oft Sicil al shiuereth, there with flaks smoakye be sparckled. That night in forrest to vs pouke bugs gastlye be tendred. Thee cause wee find not, for noise phantastical offred. Thee stars imparted no light, thee welken is heauye: And the moon enshryned with closet clowdye remayned. Thee morning brightnesse dooth luster in east seat Eous, And night shades moysturs glittring Aurora repealeth. When that on a suddeyn we behold a windbeaten hard shrimp, With lanck wan visadge, with rags iags patcherye clowted, His fists too the skyward rearing: heere wee stood amazed. A meigre leane rake with a long berd goatlyke; aparrayld Jn shrub weeds thorny:by his byrth a Grecian holden. One that too Troy broyls whillon from his countrye repayred. When the skrag had marcked far a loof thee Troian atyring, And Troian weapons, in steps he stutted, apaled: And fixt his footing, at leingth with desperat offer Too the shore hee neered, theese speeches merciful vttring. By stars J craue you, by the ayre, by the celical houshold, Hoyse me hence (O Troians) too sum oother countrye me whirrye. Playnelye to speake algats, for a Greeke my self J doe knowledge, And that I too Troytowne with purposed emnitye sayled. If this my trespasse now claymeth duelye reuengment Plunge me deepe in the waters, and lodge me in Neptun his harboure. If mens hands slea mee, such mannish slaughter J wish for. Thus sayd he, downe kneeling, and oure feete mournefuly clasping. Then we hym desyred first too discoouer his ofspring, After too manifest this his hard and destenye bitter. My father Anchises gaue his hand to the wretch on a suddeyn, And with al a pardon, with saulfe protection, offred. Thee captiue, shaking of feare, too parlye thus entred. Borne I was in the Itacan countrey, mate of haples Vlisses, Named Achœmenides, my syre also cald Adamastus, A good honest poore man (would we in that penurye lasted) Sent me toe youre Troy wars, at last my coompanye skared From this countrye cruel, dyd posting leaue me behynde theym, In Cyclops kennel, thee laystow dirtye, the foule den. Jn this grislye palaice, in forme and quantitye mightye, Palpable and groaping darcknesse with murther aboundeth. Hee doth in al mischiefe surpasse, hee mounts to the sky top. (Al the heunly feloship from the earth such a monster abandon) Hard he is too be viewed, too se hym no person abydeth. Thee blud with the entrayls of men, by hym slaughtred, he gnaweth. And of my feloes I saw that a couple he grapled On ground sow grooueling, and theym with villenye crusshed, At flint hard dasshing, thee goare blood spowteth of eeche syde, And swyms in the thrashold, I saw flesh bluddye toe slauer, When the cob had maunged the gobets foule garbaged haulfe quick. Yeet got he not shotfree, this butcherye quighted Ulisses: In which doughtye peril the Ithacan moste wiselye bethoght hym. For the vnsauerye rakhel with collops bludred yfrancked, With chuffe chaffe wynesops lyke a gourd bourrachoe replennisht, His nodil in crosse wise wresting downe droups to the growndward, In belche galp vometing with dead sleape snortye the collops, Raw with wyne soused, we doe pray toe supernal asemblye, Round with al embaying thee muffe maffe loller; eke hastlye With toole sharp poincted wee boarde and perced his oane light, That stood in his lowring front gloommish malleted onlye. Lyke Greekish tergat glistring, or Phœbus his hornebeams. Thus the death of feloes on a lout wee gladlye reuenged. But seye flee caytiefs, hy ye hence, cut swiftlye the cables. Pack fro the shoare. For such as in prison thee great Polyphemus is holden, His sheepflocks foddring, from dugs mylck thriftelye squising, Thee lyke heere in mountayns doo randge in number an hundred, That bee cursd Cyclopes in naming vsual highted. Thee moone three seasons her passadge orbical eended Sence J heere in forrest and cabbans gastlye dyd harboure, With bestes fel saluadge: and in caues stoanye Cyclopes Dayly I se, theire trampling and yelling hellish abhorring. My self I dieted with sloas, and thinlye with hawthorns, With mast, and with roots of eeche herb J swadgde my great hunger. J pryed al quarters, and first this nauye to shoare ward Swift, I scryed, sayling too which my self I remitted, Of what condicion, what countryso eauer yt had beene. Now tis sufficient that I skape fro this horribil Island. Mee rather extinguish with soom blud murther or oother. Scant had he thus spoaken: when that from mountenus hil toppe Al wee see the giaunt, with his hole flock lowbylyke hagling. Namde the shepeherd Polyphem, to the wel knowne sea syd aproching. A fowle fog monster, great swad, depriued of eyesight. His fists and stalcking are propt with trunck of a pynetree. His flock hym doe folow, this charge hym chieflye reioyceth. In grief al his coomfort on neck his whistle is hanged. When that too the seasyde thee swayne Longolius hobbled, Hee rinst in the water thee drosse from his late bored eyelyd. His tusk grimlye gnashing, in seas far waltred, he groyleth: Scantly doo the water surmounting reache toe the shoulders. But we being feared, from that coast hastlye remooued, And with vs embarcked thee Greekish suitur, as amplye His due request merited, wee chopt of softlye the cables. Swift wee sweepe the seafroth with nimble lustilad oare striefe. Thee noise he perceaued, then he turning warelye listeth. But when he considerd, that wee preuented his handling, And that from foloing oure ships thee fluds hye reuockt hym, Loud the lowbye brayed with belling monsterus eccho: Thee water hee shaketh, with his owt cryes Italye trembleth. And with a thick thundring thee fyerde fordge Ætna rebounded. Then runs from mountayns and woods thee rownseual helswarme Of Cyclopan lurdens to the shoars in coompanye clustring. Far we se theym distaunt: vs grimly and vaynely beholding. Vp to the sky reatching, thee breetherne swish swash of Ætna. A folck moale fulsoom, for sight moste fitlye resembling Trees of loftye cipers, with thickned multitud oakroas: Or Ioues great forrest, or woods of mightye Diana. Feare thear vs enforced with posting speedines headlong Too swap of oure cables, and fal to the seas at auenture. But yeet king Helenus iump twixt Scylla and the Charybdis For to sayl vs monished, with no great dangerus hazard. Yeet we wer ons mynded, backward thee nauye to mayster. Heere loa behold Boreas from bouch of north blo Pelorus Oure ships ful chargeth, thee quick rocks stoanye we passed: And great Pantagia, and Megarus with Tapsus his Island. Theese soyls fore wandred to oure men were truelye related By poore Achœmenides, mate too thee luckles Ulisses. Face too countrye Sicil theare stands a dangerus Island Plemmyrium stormy, but yt old past auncetrye cleaped Ortygia: Alpheüs, men say, thee great flud of Elis Under seabottoms this passadge ferreted, and now Swift fro Arethusa going meets in fluds of Sicil Island. That country deitee, thogh wild, wee woorshiped, and thence Wee sayld and trauayled to the coast of fertil Elorus. Then we grate on rockrayes and bancks of stoanye Pachynus, And Camarina riuer, to remooue by destenye barred. Also we through passed thee fields of statelye Geloüs. And thee mightye water, by custoom great Gela named. Thence strong buylt Agragas his huge high wals loftelye vaunceth, That steeds courrageous with racebrood plentiful offred. And with lyke sayling wee passe thee wooddye Selinis: And deepe gulfs syncking of blind Lilybeia rockish. After too Drepanus bad roade not luckye we sayled. Heere loa being scaped from rough tempestuus huffling, My father Anchises, in cares my accustomed helper, I loose: ô my father, wyl you forsake me, thus eending My toyls and my trauayls, why then dyd I mayster al hazards? Nor propheting Helenus, when he foretold dangerus hard haps For spake this burial mourning, nor filthye Celœno. This was last my laboure, thee knot claspt of myn auentures. From thence God mee shoou'd too this your gratius empyre. Thus father Æneas soly toe the coompanye listning His long dryrye viadge, and Gods set destenye chaunted. At leingth kept he silence, with finnished historye resting. Finis libri tertij. THEE FOVRTH BOOKE OF VIRGIL HIS ÆNEIS. Bvt the Queene in meane while with carks qu?dare deepe anguisht, Her wound fed by Venus, with firebayt smoldred is hooked. Thee wights doughtye manhood leagd with gentilytye nobil, His woords fitlye placed, with his heunly phisnomye pleasing, March throgh her hert mustring, al in her brest deepelye she printeth. Theese carcking cratchets her sleeping natural hynder. Thee next day foloing Phœbus dyd clarifye brightlye Thee world with luster, watrye shaads Aurora remooued, When to her deere sister, with woords, haulf gyddye she raueth. Sister An, J merueyle, what dreams mee terrefye napping, What newcoom trauayler, what guest in my harborye lighted? How braue he dooth court yt? what strength and coorrage he carryes? I beleue yt certeyn (ne yet hold I yt vaynelye reported) That fro the great linnadge of Gods his pettegre shooteth. Feare shews pitfle crauens: good God, what destenye wayward Hath the man endured? what bickrings bitter he passed? Had not J foresnaffled my mynde by votarye promise, Not toe yoke in wedlock too no wight earthlye mye person, When my first feloship by murther beastlye was eended, Had not I such daliaunce, such pipling bed gle renounced, Haplye this oane faulty trespas might bring me toe bending. An (toe the my meaning and mynd J doe playnelye set open) Sence the death of my husband, too wyt, the Sichœus vnhappye, Sence mye cruel broother defilde the domestical altars: Onlye this od gallant hath bowd my phansye toe lyking, And my looue hath gayned: thee skorcht step of old fyre J sauoure. But first with vengaunce let the earth mee swallo toe bottom, Or father omnipotent with lightnings dyng me toe lymbo, And to Erebus shading darcknesse, too dungeon hellish, Eare that I shal thye statutes (ô shamefast chastitye) cancel. Hee, that first me yoked for wiefe, dyd carrye my first looue, Hardlye let hym shrowd yt, close claspt in graue let yt harboure. When she thus had spoaken, with tears her brest she replennisht. Then sayd An (ô sister, than light more deerely belooued) Wyl ye stil in pining youre youthful ioylitye stiefle? Wyl ye not haue children, nor sweete Venus happye rewarding's? Weene ye that oure lyking a scalp of a charuel In heedeth? Graunt, earst that noe woer could catche youre phansye to wedlock, Nor Lybye land lordinges, ne by Tyre despised Iarbas, Nor manye stat's lofty, that rest in plentiful Affrick: Wyl ye stil endeuoure with pleasd looue vaynelye to iustle? Wyl ye be forgetting in what curst countrye ye soiourne? Heere towns of Getuls doo stand, a nation hardye, Heere ye sit embayed with Moors, with Syrtis vnhowsed. Theare pepil of Barcey through soale wyld barrenes harboure. What shal I tel further, what broyle Tyrus angrye doth hammer, What threats your broother thunders. J thinck, that the Godhead, with Junoes prosperus ayding, Thee Troian vessels too this youre segnorye pelted. Loa what a fayre citty shal mount, what stablished empyre By this great wedlock: with might of the vnitye Troian. How far shal be fleing thee glorie renowmed of Affrick. Of Gods craue pardon, then, when youre seruice is eended, Youre new guest frollick, his stay let forgerye linger, Til winters lowring bee past, and rayne make Orion. Til they rig al vessels, vntil tyme stormye be swaged. With theese woords flaming her brest was kendled in hoatlooue: Shee graunts to her tottring mynd hoape, shame bashful auoyding. First to the church gad they, rest and peace meekelye requesting, In sacrifice killing, by woont accustomed, hogrels: First to Ceres makelaw, too Phœbus, then to Lyœus: Chieflye to Queene Iuno, that wedlocks vnitye knitteth. Thee bol in hand firmely Queene Dido, the bewtiful, holding, Pourd yt amydst both the horns peaking of lillye white heyfer. Soomtyme to the altars, distant, of Gods she resorteth: And makes fresh sacrifice, the catal, new slaughtered, heeding. Shee weens her fortune by guts, hoate smoakye, to conster. Ô the superstitions of beldam trumperye sooth says. Now what auayle temples, or vows, whilst deepelye the flamd fire Kendleth in her marrow, whilst wound in brest cel is aking. Dido, the wretch, burneth, neere mad through cittye she stalketh: Much lyke a doa wounded too death, not marcked of heerdman, His dart sharp headed through forrest Cassian hurling, On the doa iump lighteh by soom chaunce medlye: the weapon, Thee bodye sore ranckling dooth stur thee deere to the frithward, Or to falow straining, in corps thee deadlye staf hangeth. Often about thee wals Æneas slilye she trayneth: Too welth Sidonian poincting, too cittye nere eended. Her bye tale owt hauking amyd oft her parlye she chocketh. Soomtyme she inuites theym too deynty bancquet in eeuening: Now fresh agayne crauing of Troian toyle the recital, From lyps of Chronicler with blincking listenes hanging. When they be departed, when light of mooneshine is housed, And stars downe gliding at due tyme of slumber ar ayming, Restles aloane sobbing on left benche soalye she sytteth: Her selfe not present she both hyers and sees the man absent. Or the slip Ascanius (for sainct thee shrinecase adoring) Shee cols for the father: with busse to lenifye loouefits. Thee towrs new, founded mount not, thee coompanye youthful Surcease from warfeats, there toyls no swincker in hauen; Nor mason in bulwarck: wurcks interrupted ar hanging. And wals hudge menacing, thee sky top in altitud eeuening. When the plage of pacient thee spouse of Iuppiter heeded, And noe reporte wandring thee looue furye kendled abated, Thus toe Uenus turning spake thee Saturnical empresse. A praise of high reckning, eke a catche to be greatlye renowmed You with youre pricket purchast, loa the victorye famouse: With two Gods packing one woomman sellye to coosen. Wel dyd J know, mistresse, that you my great harborye feared, Mightelye mistrusting thee seats of Carthage, hye mounted. When shal, Hoa, bee shouted? too what drift feede we this anger? Why be we not forward theese mat's too marrye to geather And a leage eternal conclude? thy long wish is hested. Dido with hertlyking dooth burne, her boans furye fretteth. Let theese sundrye pepils theare for bee lincked in one loare. Also let oure Dido vayle her hert too bedfeloe Troian: And Tyrian kingdooms to the shal, for dowrye, be graunted. Then to her (for wisely shee found thee treacherye feined Too fetch too Tyrians the great empyre of Jtalye woorcking) Thus Uenus her speeches dyd bend. What niddipol hare brayne Would scorne this couenaunt? would with thee gladlye be iarring? If so this happye trauayle shal so be with happines ayded. But fates mee stamering doo make, yf Iuppiter holdeth Best, that the Tyrians and Troian progenye couple, That they be conioigned, that both they freendlye be leaged. You to hym bee spoused: thee trouth with pillotoy ferret. On before, and I folow. Too this ladye Iuno replyed. That labor I warrant. Now by what craftinis are wee Too wurck this stratagem: marck wel, for I brieflye wyl open. Thee Prince Æneas and eke Queene Dido the poore soule For to h?nt in forrest too morro be fullye resolued, So soon as in east coaste with bright beams Titan apeereth. Then wyl J round coompasse with clowd grim foggye these hunters. When they shal in thickets thee coouert maynelye be drawing. Al the skye shal rustle with thumping thunderus hurring. Thee men I wyl scatter, they shal be in darcknes al hooueld. Dido and thee Troian captayne shal iumble in one den. Jf with his my trauayle thy mynd and phansye be meeting Then wyl I thee wedlock with firme affinitye fasten: This shal bee the bryde hymne. To the drift Venus, vttred, agreed, Smoothlye with al simpring, too groape suche treacherus handling. Thee whilst thee dawning Aurora fro the Ocean hastned, And the May fresh yoonckers to the gates doo make there asemblye With nets and catch toyls, and hunt spears plentiful yrond: With the hounds quicksenting, with pricking galloper horsman. Long for thee Princesse thee Moors gentilitye wayted, As yet in her pincking not pranckt with trinckerye trinckets: As they stood attending thee whilst her trapt genet hautye Deckt with ritche scarlet, with gould stood furniture hanging, Praunseth on al startling, and on byt gingled he chaumpeth. At leingth foorth she fleeth with swarming coompanye circled, In cloke Sidonical with rich dye brightlye besprinckled. Her locks are broyded with gould, her quiuer is hanging Backward: with gould tache thee vesture purple is holden. Thee band of Troians lykewise, with wanton Jülus Doo marche on forward: but of al thee Lucifer heunlye Jn bewty Æneas hymself to the coompanye rancketh. Lyke when as hard frozen Lycia and Zanth floods be relinquisht By Pheebe, to Delos, his natiue contrye seat, hastning. Hee poinctes a dawnsing, foorth with thee rustical hoblobs Of Cretes, of Dryopes, and payncted clowns Agathyrsi Dooe fetch theyre gambalds hopping neere consecrat altars. Hee trips on Zanthus mountayn, with delicat hearelocks Trayling: with greene shrubs and pure gould neatly becrampound His shafts on shoulder rattle: the lyke hautye resemblaunce Carried Æneas with glistring coomlines heunlye. When they toe thee mountayns and too layrs vncoth aproched, Then, loa, behold ye, breaking thee goats doo trip fro the rocktops Neere toe the playne: the heard deare dooth stray fr? mounten vnbarb ourd. Thee chase is ensued with passadge dustye be powdred. But the lad Ascanius, with praunsing courser hye mounted, Dooth manage in valley, now theym, now theese ouerambling. Hee scornes theese rascal tame games, but a sounder of hogsteers, Or thee brownye lion too stalck fro the mounten he wissheth. Thee whilst in the skye seat great bouncing rumbelo thundring Ratleth: downe powring too sleete thick hayle knob is added. Thee Tyrian feloship with yoouthful Troian asemblye And Venus hautye nephew doo run too sundrye set houses. Hudge fluds lowdlye freaming from mountayns loftye be trowlling, Dido and thee Troian captayne doo iumble in one den. Then the earth crau's the banes, theare too watrye Iuno, the chaplayne, Seams vp thee bedmatch, the fyre and ayre testifie wedlock. And Nymphs in mountayns high typ doe squeak, bullelo, yearning. That day cros and dismal was cause of mischief al after, And bane of her killing; her fame for sleight she regarded. No more dooth she laboure too mask her Phansye with hudwinck, With thee name of wedlock her carnal leacherye cloaking, Straight through towns Lybical this fame with an infamye rangeth. Fame the groyl vngentil, then whom none swifter is extant; Limber in her whisking: her streingth in iournye she trebbleth; First lyke a shrimp squatting for feare, then boldlye she roameth On ground prowd ietting: shee soars vp nimblye toe skyward; The earth, her dame, chauffing with graund Gods celical anger, Litterd this leueret, the syb, as men sundrye rehersed, Too the giant Cœus, sister to swad Encelad holden. Furth she quicklye galops, with wingflight swallolyke hastning. A foule fog pack paunch: what feathers plumye she beareth, So manye squint eyebals shee keeps (a relation vncoth) So manye tongues clapper, with her ears and lip labor eeuened. Jn the dead of night tyme to the skyes shee flickereth, howling Through the earth shade skipping, her sight from slumber amoouing. Whilst the sun is shyning the bagage close lodgeth in housroofs, Or tops of turrets, with feare towns loftye she frighteth. As readye forgde fittons, as true tales vaynelye toe twattle. Thee pepil in iangling this raynebeaten harlotrye filled: Meerelye furth chatting feats past, and feats not atempted. That the duke Æneas from Troians auncetrye sprouting, In Lybye coast landed, with whom fayre Dido, the Princesse, Her person barterd, and that they both be resolued, Thee winter season too wast in leacherye wanton. Retchles of her kingdoom, with rutting bitcherye sauted. This that prat'pye cadesse labored too trumpet in eeche place. Furth she fleeth posting to the kingly rector Iarbas. With the brute enflaming his mynd she doth huddle on anger. Soon to the Prince Ammon, Garamans thee fayrye, bye rape snacht, His moother named; this king too Iuppiter heunly Temples twise fifty dyd buyld, lyke number of altars, With fire continual theese seats too consecrat vsing, With the blud of sacrifice floating, with delicat herbflowrs. Netled with theese brackye nouels as wild as a marche hare Jn the myd of the Idols (men tel) neere furnished altars, Theese woords, vplifting both his hands, he toe Iuppiter vttred. Juppiter almighty, whom men Maurusian, eating On the tabils vernisht, with cuprit's magnifye dulye: Eyest thow this filthood? shal wee, father heunlye; be carelesse Of thy claps thundring? or when fiers glimrye be listed In clowds grim gloomming with bounce doo terrifye worldlings? A coy tyb, as vagabund in this my segnorye wandring, That the plat of Carthage from mee by coosinage hooked, T'whom gaue J fayre tilladge, and eeke lawes needful enacted, Hath scornd my wedlock: Æneas lord she reteyneth. Now this smocktoy Paris with berdlesse coompanye wayted, With Greekish coronet, with falling woommanish hearelocks Lyke fiest hound mylcksop trimd vp, thee victorye catcheth. And wee beat the bushes, thee stil with woorship adoring. Onlye for oure seruice soom praysed vanitye gleaming. Thee prayer of playntiefe, grappling thee consecrat altars, Iuppiter hard; foorth with to, the courte hee whirled his eyesight, And viewd theese bedmat's no sound reputation heeding. With woords imperial thus he speaks and Mercurye chargeth. Flee my sun, and busk on, let sweete winds swiftlye be soommond, And toe the duke Troian, that vaynelye in Carthage abydeth, Thee towns neglecting, that to hym set destenye lotteth, Theese woords deliuer, from mee to hym carrye this errand. His paragon moother to vs framd a promise of hudgger Accoumpt and reckning, then he now perfourmeth, vpon that Hoape future expected, from Troy flam's twise she reliu'd hym. Too me she dyd promise, that he should bee the emperor hautye, That would, with bickring, fierce martial Italye vanquish: Thee Troian famely with wide spread glorye reuiuing: And globe of al regions with laws right equitye bridle. Too feats so valiant yf that no glorye doth hast hym, Or to hym thee catching of fame so woorthye be toyle soom: Shal, by syre, Ascanius from Roman cittye be loytred? What doth he forge? wherefore wil he rest in countrye so freendlesse? Why the Lauin regions, and stock he so slilye reputeth? Thee sea let hym trauerse: this is al: to hym signifye this muche. Ioue sayd: eke hee the fathers commaund to accomplisse apoincteth. First of al his woorcking too his feete shooes goulden he knitteth, By which he with wind blast ruffling oft flittereth vpward, Wheather he land regions or rough seas surgye doth harrow. His rod next he handleth: by which from the helly Bocardo Touzt tost souls be freeth: diuerse to the prison he plungeth. Hee causeth sleeping and bars: bye death eyelyd vphasping. With the rod eke he sheareth thee winds, and scattereth high clowds. As thus he dyd flicker, thee top wyth sideryb of Atlas Hee sees, that proppeth, with crowne, the supernal Olympus, Atlas, whose pallet with pynetrees plentiful hooueld, In grim clowds darckned, with showrs and windpuf is haunted. Thee snoa whit his shoulders dooth cloath, fluds mightye be rowling From the chyn oldlye riueld, his beard with frost hoare is hardned. First on this mounteyn thee winged Mercurie lighted: From thence too the waters his course hee bended al headlong. Muche lyke abyrd nestled neere shoars or desolat hilrocks: Not to the sky maynely, but neere sea meanelye she flickreth. So with a meane passadge twixt sky and sea Mercurye slideth To Lyby coast sandy; thee sharp wynds speedelye shauing, Mercurye thee Cyllen, bye the mount Cyllene begotten. On Lyby land tenements with winged feete when he lighted, Hee spyed Æneas new castels thriftelye founding, And howsrowms altring:hee woare then a gorgeus hanger With iaspar yellow: hee shynde with mantel ypurpled, From shoulders trayling: this braue roabe Dido, the ritch Queene, Soalye with her handwurck dyd weaue: with gould wyre yt heaping. Mercurye thus greets hym: Now sir; you wholye be careful Too found new Carthage, with youre braue bedfelo sotted You buyld a cittye, youre owne state slilye regarding. Now to the God sentmee from shining brightned Olympus, The God of al the godheads, managing heune and places earthlye, Hee gaue commaundement, too thee too carrye this erraund. What doe ye forge? wherefore thus vaynely in land Lybye mitche you? Too feats ful valiant yf that no glorye doth egge the, Or toe the thee catching of fame soo woorthye be toyl soom, Cast care on Ascanius rising, of the heyrs of Iülus. T'whom the stat Italian with Roman cittye belongeth. When this round message thee Cyllen Mercurye whisperd, In myd of his parling from gazing mortal he shrincketh: From lookers eyesight too thinnes he vannished ayrye. But the duke Æneas with sight so geason agasted, His bush starck staring with feare, cleene speecheles abyded. Hee to fle soare longeth, this sweet soyl streight to relinquish, By Gods imperial monishing auctoritye warned. Heere but alas he myred what course may be warelye taken; How shal he too Princesse, with looues hoat phrensye reteyned, Breake this cold messadge? what woords shal shape the beginning. From thee poast toe piler with thoght his rackt wyt he tosseth. Now to this od stratagem, now too that counseyl alying. After long mooting, this course for better he deemed. Mnestheus hee called, Sergest and manlye Cloanthus, For to rig in secret theyre ships, and coompanye summon, With weapons ready: Thee cause also of changabil hastning Deepelye toe dissemble: when eke opportunitye serued, Whilst no breche of freendship thee good ladye Dido remembers, And due place of speaking sweetly with season is offred, They would theire passadge close steale. Thee knightes agreed, With wil moste forward, to haste on too iournye resolued. How beyt thee Princesse (what wyle can iuggle a loouer?) Found owt this cogging: in thoght what first she reuolued That toe doe they mynded: things standing saulflye she feareth. Fame, the blab vnciuil, fosters her phansye reciting, That the fleete is strongly furnisht, theire passage apoincted. Deuoyd of al counsayle scolding through cittye she ploddeth. Mutch lyke Dame Thyas with great sollemnitye sturred Of Bacchus third yeers feasting, when quaftyde aproacheth, And showts in night tyme doo ringe in loftye Cithœron. At last she Æneas thus, not prouoked, asaulteth. And thoghst thow, faythlesse coystrel, so smoothlye to shaddow Thy packing practise? from my soyle priuelye slincking? Shal not my lyking, ne yet earst fayth plighted in handclaspe, Nor Didoes burial from this crosse iournye withold the? Further; in a winters soure storme must nauye be launched? Mind'st thow with northen bluster thee mayne sea to trauerse Thow cruel hert haggard? what? yf hence too countrye the passage Thow took'st not stranged: suppose Troy cittye remayned: Through the sea fierce swelling would'st thow to Troy cittye be pack?g? Shunst thow my presence? By theese tear's, and bye thye righthand (Sence that J, poore caytiefe, noght els to mye self doe relinquish) By the knot of wedlock, by looues sollemnitye sealed, If that I deserued too fore soom kindnes, or ennye Part of my person to the whillon pleasur a furded To my state empayring let yeet soom mercye be tenderd. I doe craue (yf toe prayers as yeet soom nouke be reserued) Beat downe thy purpose, thy mynd from iournye reclayming. For thy sake in Lybical regions and in Nemod hateful I liue: my Tyrian subiectes pursue me with anger. For thy sake J stayned whillon my chastitye spotlesse: And honor old batterd, to the sky with glorye me lifting. And now, guest, wheather doe ye skud from deaths fit of hostace? That terme must I borowe, syth I dare not cal the myne husband. Why do I breath longer? shal J liue til cittye mye broother Pigmalion ransack? or too tyme J be prisoner holden By thee Getul Järb? yf yeet soom progenye from me Had crawld, by the fatherd, yf a cockney-dandiprat hopthumb, Prittye lad Æneas, in my court, wantoned, ere thow Took'st this filthye fleing, that thee with phisnomye lyckned, Ine then had reckned my self for desolat owtcaste. Shee sayd: he persisting too doo what Iuppiter heasted, Sturd not an eye, graueling in his hert his sorroful anguish. At length thus briefly dyd he parle: I may not, I wil not Deny thy beneficts ful as amply, as can be recounted, Vnto me deliu'red: so long shal I Dido remember, Whilst I my self mynd shal: whilst lyms with spirit ar orderd. Brieflye for a weighty matter few woords I wil utter. Neauer I foremynded (let not mee falslye be threpped) For toe slip in secret by flight: ne yet eauer I thralled My self too wedlock: I toe no such chapmenhed harckned. If toe mye mynd priuat my fatal fortun agreed, If so that al sorrows iump with my phansye were eended, Then should bee chiefly bye me Troian cittye redressed, And kinreds rellicques woorshipt: then should be renewed Thee courte of Priamus: yea thogh that victorye razed Theese monuments, yet agayne by mee they should be repayred. But now to Jtalian kingdooms vs sendeth Apollo, And vs to Italian regions set destenye warneth. Theare rests oure lyking: there eke oure wisht countrye remayneth. Jf ye be delighted, too see new Carthage vp hoouering, And a Moore in Morish citty youre phansye ye settle: Why so may not Troians theire course to good Italye coompasse? What reason embars theym, soom forreyn countrye to ferret? Of father Anchises thee goast and grislye resemblaunce, When the day dooth vannish, when lights eke starrye be twinckling, In sleepe mee monisheth, with visadge buggish he feareth. And my sun Ascanius mee pricks, by me rightlye belooued: Whom from the Jtalian regions toe toe long J doe linger. Latelye toe mee posted from Ioue thee truch sprit, or herrald Of Gods (thee deityes this sooth too wytnes I summon) Hee dyd, in expressed commaund, to me message his erraund. I saw most liuely, when that neere towne wal he lighted; Jn this eare hee towted thee speeche. Cease therefor, I pray you, Mee to teare, and also youre self, with drirye rehersals. Italye not willing I seeke. Whilst he thus in pleading dyd dwel, shee surlye beheeld hym: Heere she dothe her visadge, thear skew, eeche member in inchmeale In long mummye silence limming: then shrewdlye she scoldeth. No Godes is thye parent, nor th' wart of Dardanus ofspring, Thow periurde fay toure: but amydst rocks, Cancasus haggish Bred the, with a tigers soure milck vnseasoned, vdderd. What shal I dissemble? what poincts more weightye reserue J? At my tears showring dyd he sigh? dyd he winck with his eyelyd? Ons dyd he weepe vanquisht? dyd he yeeld ons mercye toe loouemate? What shal I first vtter? wyl not graund Iuno with hastning, Nor thee father Saturne with his eyes bent rightlye behold this? Fayth quite is exiled: fro the shoare late a runnagat hedgebrat, A tarbreeche quystroune dyd I take, with phrensye betrasshed I placed in kingdoom, both ships and coompanye gracing. Woa to me thus stamping, sutch braynsick foolerye beiching. Marck the speake, I pray you, wel coucht: Now sothtel Apollo, Now Lycian fortuns, from very Iuppiter heunlye A menacing message, by the Gods ambassador, vttred. Foorsooth; this thye viadge with care Saincts celical heapeth, Theire brayns vnquieted with this baldare be buzing. I stay not thye body, ne on baw vaw tromperye descant. Rack toe soyl Italian: crosse thee seas: fish for a kingdoom. Verely, in hoape rest I (yf Gods may take duelye reuengment) With gagd rocks coompast, then vaynely, Dido, reciting, Thow shalt bee punnisht. Ile with fyre swartish hop after. When death hath vntwined my soule from carcas his holding, J wyl, as hobgoblin, foloa thee: thow shalt be soare handled: I shal hyre, I doubt not, thy pangs in lymbo related. Her talck in the mydel, with this last parlye, she throtled. And from his sight parted, with tortours queazye disorderd. Hym shee left daunted with feare, woords duitiful hamring For to reply. The lady sowning mayds carrye to smooth bed Of marble glittring, on beers her softlye reposing. But the good Æneas (althogh that he cooueted hertlye, For to swage her malady, with woords to qualifye sorrows) Jn groans deepe scalding, his kindmynd sindged in hoatlooue, Yeet the wyl of the Godheads foloing, too nauye returneth. Thee Troian mariners now drudge: theire fleet they doe lavnch foorth: And vessels, calcked with roasen smearye, be floating. Vp they trus oars boughed with plancks vnfinnished, hastning From thence theire passadge. Now to the strond may ye see from towne thee multitude hopping. Much lyk when pismers theire corne in granar ar hurding, Careful of a winter nipping, in barns they bepiling. Thee blackgarde marching dooth wurck, in path way, ther haruest. Parte of theese laborers on shoulders carrye the burdens Of shocks: soom grangers with goade iads restye be pricking, And spur on ants luskish. With swinck eeche corner aboundeth. But toe the, poore Dido, this sight so skearye beholding, What feeling creepeth? what sobbing sorroful hert sigh In thy corps hized, when from towre, loftelye mounted, Thow saw'st thee banck sydes coouerd, and right to thyne eyesight Thow saw'st seas ringing with cheering clamorous hoyssayle? Scuruye looue, in pacients what moods thow mightelye forcest. Now she is constrayned, too formoure tears toe be turning. With suit freshlye praying, too looue shee tendereth hommage. No meane vnattempted, ne vnsoght, ear that she dye, leauing. Sister An, in cluster you see thee coompanye swarming On the shoare in flockmeale: for wind theire sayles ar hoysted. On sterne thee mariners haue setled meerelye garlands. If that I foremynded this greefe so mischeuus hapned, Then should I, sister, moderat this sorroful hazard. Yeet good An, J pray thee, doe me wretch this pleasure in one thing. For the chiefe of woomen this breakeuow naughtye regarded, Chieflye to the hee wounted to recount his priuitye secret. His daps and sweetening good moods to the soalye were opned. Post to hym (good sister) toe mye proud foa tel ye this erraund. J dyd not ransack, with Greeks conspiracye, Troytowne. Nor yet agaynst Troians send I enny vessel apoincted. Nor father Anchises boans crusht J, ne scattred his ashes. What reason hym leadeth to my suite too boombas his hyring? Wheather is hee flitting? To his leefe pheere graunt he this one boone, Too stay for a better passadge, for a prosperus hufgale. I clayme no old wedlock, that he fowly and falslye betrayed. Nor that he thee regiment doo loose of his Italye kingdooms. I craue a vayne respit, but a spirt toe mye phrensye relenting, Til my fate hath schoold mee too mourne my destenye drowping. Theese I craue in pardon for last (yeeld mercye to sister) Which when you tender, toe mye death that shal be requighted. In this wise she prayed: such tears her sister vnhappye Dooth to and fro carry: but he with no tearedrop is altred: Nor to vayne entreatings with listning tractable harckneth. Thee fat's are pugnant, God, his ears quight stifned in hardnesse. Much lyke as in forrest a long set dottrel, or oaktree, With northen blusters too parts contrayrye retossed: Thee winds scold strugling, the threshing thick crush crash is owtborne, Thee boughs frap whurring, when stem with blastbob is hacked: Yeet the tre stands sturdy: for as yt toe the skytyp is haunced, So far is yt crampornd with roote deepe dibled at helgat's: So this courragious gallant with clustered erraunds Js cloyed and stinging sharp car's in brest doe lye thrilling. His mynd vnuariant doth stand, tears vaynelye doe gutter. Dido the poore Princesse gauld with such destenye cutting, Crau's mortal passadge: too looke toe the sky she repyneth. And toe put her purpose forward, this light toe relinquish, When she the gift sacrifice with the incense burned on altars (Grislye to bee spoaken) thee moysture swartlye was altred: And the wyne, in powring, lyke blood black soottsh apeered. This too no creature, no, not to her sister is opned. Further eke in the palaice a chapel fayre marbil abydeth, Uowd to her first husband, which cel shee woorshiped highlye. With whit lillye fleses, with garland greenish adorned: Heere to her ful seeming she dyd hyre thee clamor of elfish Goast of her old husband, her furth to his coompanye wafting, When the earth with thee shaads of night was darcklye bemuffled. Also on thee turrets the skrich howle, lyke fetchliefe ysetled, Her burial roundel dooth ruck, and cruncketh in howling. Sundrye such od prophecyes, many such prognosticat omens, In foretyme coyned, theire threatnings terrible vtterd. Yea cruel Æneas in dreame to her seemeth apeering, Her furious chasing: her self left also, she deemed, Post aloan, and soaly from woonted coompanye singled, Too trauayl a iourney toe toe long, and that she returneth, Too seek her owne Tyrians, through cragged passages vncooth. Much lyke when Pentheus thee troups fel of hellish asemblye, And two soons shyning, and two Thebs vaynely beholdeth. Or lyke as, in skaffold theaters, is touzed Orestes From his dame gastlye fleeing, with flam's and poysoned adders: Or black scaalde serpents, and when that in entrye be setled Sour feends grimlye gnashing, ramping with grislye reuengment. When she thus in raging dyd swel: when plunged in anguish, For to dye shee mynded, the mean and thee season apoincted, Theese forged speeches to her sister sorroful vttring, Shee shrowds her purpose, false hoape with phisnomye feigning. Sister, an od by knack haue J found (now rest ye triumphaunt) Either this gadling shal swiftlye to mee be returned, Or fro this hoat looue sits J shal bee shortlye retrayted. Where the sun is woonted too set, neere the Ocean eending, Thee last poinct farthest of dwellers Æthiop: Atlas Mighty in this region bolsters thee starred Olympus. From thence came a mayd priest, in soyle Massyla begotten, Seixten of Hesperides Sinagog, this sorceres vsed, For too cram the dragon: she, on trecs, slips consecrat heeded. Hoonnye liquid sprinckling and breede sleepe wild popye strawing. For to fre mynds, snared with looue, this Margerye voucheth, Whom she wil, and oothers with loouetraps stronglye to fetter. Also to stay the riuers, and back globs starrye returning. In night too cooniure spirits: theare shal ye se (sister) Thee ground right vnder too groane, trees bigge to fal headlong. Thee Gods too witnesse, so thee, deare sister, J lykewise Cal, bye thye sweet pallet, me this hard extremitye forceth For to put in practise magical feats, sorcerye charming. Wherefor in al secret let logs of tymber, in inner Court, with speede, be reked, thee sky with loftines hitting. Also se, that thither you bring thee martial armoure, That the peasaunt left heere, with al his misfortuned ensigns. Theare bed must be placed, thee wedlock bed, where J, poore wretch, Al my bane haue purchaste: theese rit's thee Cooniures asketh, Too burne al monuments of this cursd villenus hoap loast. This sayd, streight a silence shee keep's: her phisnomye paleth. And yet An had nothing deemed, that Dido, the sister, Preparde theese burials to her self, she no such furye casteth. Or that woorse mischief might bee to her sister aproching, Then when shee mourned the death of spouse soarye, Sichœus. Thearefor her encheason shee purueys. But the Queene, as tymber was broght, and piled in order, And holme logs cleaued with cressets mounted ar added: With twisted garland and leau's, spred greenlye, she garnisht Thee place of her burial: there his armours al she reposed. On the bed his picture shee set, ful playnely bethincking, What would bee the sequel. There about stand consecrat altars: With which eke embayed, the she priest, vntressed in heare locks, Hundreds of the Godheds thrise tolde al giddylye calleth: Shee crieth on the Erebus darcknesse and on Chaos hoch poch. And the tripil dam Hecatee, with three faced angrye Diana. Shee pours eeke the liquours vntruely of founten Auernus. Also by thee moone shyne yoong buds, scant spirted a booue ground, Are soght too be loped with a brassye sieth also the poyson Cole black commixed with mylek: enquyrye was eke made, For to snip, in the foaling, from front of fillye the knapknob That the mare al greedy dooth snap. Her self with presents standing neere the halloed altars, Naked in her oane foote, with frock vnlaced aparrayld; Calleth at her parting on Gods: and destenye wytting Thee stars: too the Godhead, with meeke submission, hartlye Shee prayeth: yf deitee with no loare rightlye regadeth Thee slip of al faythlesse break leages, that vnequalye looued. Neere toe dead of midnight yt drew, when member of eeche thing Quick, and fore labored was, with sweet slumber, atached. Thee woods are noyselesse, thee seas late stormye be calmed. Thee stars from the sky top with glyding slipprye be shooting: Thee fields and the catal bee mum: most quentlye bedecked Fayre fowls, close lurcking in lak's, or shrowded in hard bed Of thorny thickets, through rural countrye be napping, In the silent nightyme, from thoght theire daytoyl amoouing. But the poore vnresting Dido could catch no such happye Season, too be quiet, shee sleeples is onlye remayning. Now routs of carcking troubles, with sighs, be resorting: Soomtyme fits tickling of her old looue in hertroote ar itching. Then fresh on a suddeyn shee frets, and warpeth in anger. And bayted in tugging skirmish then thus she bethoght her, What shal I doo therefore? Shal I now, lyk a castaway milckmadge, On mye woers formoure bee fawning: Too Nemod emprour Now shal J meeke be suing, oft by mee coylye refused? Therefor I must swiftly too Troian nauye be trudging, Theare me toe bynd prentise, theyr wil, lyk a gally slaue, heeding. And reason I trauayled too theym, that, by me so shielded, My formoure beneficts defrayde so kindelye requited. Wel, wel: graunt I trauayld, who would mee suffer? or of theym What man, in his vessel, prowd borne, would carrye me scorned? And alas, ô selly woomman: yeet must ye be lessond Thee freaks, thee fickle promise, thee periurye Troian? What then? with my fleeing shal J track theire nauye triumphing? Or shal J pursu theym with strong and furnished armye? And my pepil subiect, that I broght from Sidon in hazard Of liefe, too the seaward with danger shal they be pressed? Nay, nay, thye self slaughter: thy bad lief vnhappye death asketh. Thow, thow, deere sister, with my tears woommanish anguisht, With my phrensie moued, to my foa dydst cast me ful open. Might not I my lief tyme, lust fleshly and sinful auoyding, Spend lyk an vnreasoned wild beaste, and such care abandon? I kept no promise to the boans of godlye Sichœus. Such playnts and quarrels in burnt brest stronglye she crusshed. Now the good Æneas embarckt in vessel of hudgnesse, Certen of his passadge, dyd sleepe; things duelye wel orderd. Then toe the same captayne valiant, in slumber, apeered Thee selfe same visadge, that face, that phisnomye bearing In color, in speaking, thee self same Mercurye likning, Forseene in his goulden fine locks, and youthlye resemblaunce. Thus thee wight sleeping with a newcoom message he greeteth. Thow sun of heunlye Godesse, dar'st thow to slumber in hazards? See ye not, ô madman, what dangers sundrye betyde you? Heyre ye not, in listning, thee westerne fortunat huffling? Shee coyn's cursd dangers, and mischiefs forgeth on anuyl. Too dye she stands resolut: shee stormeth sweltred in anger. Wil ye not haste swiftly, whilst leasur is offred of hastning? Perdye ye shal shortly perceaue, thee seas toe be coouerd, With boats, and flaming fyre worcks toe be flasshed of eeche syde Thee shoars, vf dawning in this fel countrye shal hold you. On loa, cut of loytring, a wind fane changabil huf puffe Always is a woomman. Thus sayd, through night fog he vannisht. Then the duke Æneas, with shaddow sudden agrysed, Vp starts from slugish sleeping, and coompanye waketh. My men arise swiftly: to the tacklings speedelye stick yee: Hoise sayl's with posting: for a God from celical heunseats Sent, toe fle commaunds vs; lykewise toe cut hastlye the cabels. Loa yet agayne spurs hee. We rely toe thyn hautye behestings Who th' wart, mightye Godhead; thus agayne toe thy wil we be forward. Send thye pliaunt seruaunts thye good ayde, let stars of Olympus Lucky assist the viadge: thus he sayd: then naked his edgd sword Brandisht from the scabard hee drew: thee cabil he swappeth, Al they the lyke poste haste dyd make, with scarboro scrabbling. From the shoare owt sayle they: thee sea with great fleet is hooueld. Fluds they rake vp spuming, with keele froth fomye they furrow. Thee next day foloing lustring Aurora lay shymring, Her saffrond mattresse leauing to her bedfelo Tithon. Thee Queene, when the daylight his shining brightnes afurded, Peeps from loftye beacons, and sayling nauye beholdeth. Thee stronds and the hauens of vessels emptye she marcketh. Thrise, nay she foure seasons on fayre brest mightely bouncing, And her heare owt rooting yellow: God Iuppiter, ogh lord: Quod she, shal hee scape thus? shal a stranger geue me the slampam? With such departure my regal segnorye frumping? Shal not al oure subiects pursu with clamorus hu crye? With my fleete hoate foloing shal not theire nauye be burned? On men; alarme; fyrebrands se ye take; sayls hoyse; roa ye swiftly: What chat J foole? What place me doth hold? What phrensye me witcheth? ô forlorne Dido, now now wrawd destenye grubs the. This spite should be plyed, when thow thy auctoritye yeeldedst. Marck the fayth and kindnesse, that he shews, who is soothlye reported, Too carry his rellicques and countreye domestical house gods, And to clap on shoulders his bedred graueporer old syre. Could not I with my power both haue hackt and minced eke inchemeale Thee coystrels carcasse, next in the sea deepelye toe drenche yt? Could not I then murther, with swoord, his coompanye stragling? Yea the lad Ascanius wel I might haue slaughtered, after At tabil of the father too set thee chield to be maunged. Thee chaunce in battayle, ye wil hold, is doubtful: I graunt yt. What man had I feared, toe dye prest? I had flamed of eeche syde Theare tents and nauy, thee child, and thee father eending. Yea the race extirping: my self had I walloed on theym. ô sun in heune hye beaming, who behold'st ful woorckes al earthlye: Of theese drirye dolours eeke thow Queene Iuno the searchresse, And Godes hauty Hecatee, that dooest wights terrifye nightlye Jn pathways traueling, ye bug hags fierce set to reuengments, You Gods al mustring to the eende of wretched Elisa, Eare this; J doe craue you: for sin's due torture amoouing. Lysten too my prayers. Yf this false traytor in hauen Of force must be placed, toe the land yf destenye fling hym, If faets of the Godheds so wil: theyre wyl be don hardly. Yet let thee rascal with soldiours doughtye be lugged, Spoyled of his weapons, wandring lyke a bannished owtlaw: Haalde from the embracing of his onlye belooued Iülus: And to beg his succoure: too see thee funeral eendinges Wretched of his kynred: lykewise when he shal be relying Too streict condicions of peace, to vnlawful agreement: In wisht Princelye quiet let not thee cullion harboure: But before his fixed death tyme let his eende be cut hastlye, Jn nauel of quicksands his corps vntumbed abyding. Theese poincts humblye craue I, with blood this last wil I stablish. And you my Tyrian subiects, this linnage heere after Pursue with hate bitter, this gift se ye graunt toe myne ashes. Let no looue or lyking, no fayth nor leage be betweene you, Let there one od captayne from my boans rustye be springing, With fire eke and weapons thee caytiefs Troian auenging: Now; then; at eeche season; what so eare streingth mightye shal happ?, Let shoare bee too shoars, let seas contrarye toe seas stand, And to armours, armours I do pray, let progenye bicker. Shee sayde; eke her vexte mynd shee tost and tumbled in eeche syde, From thee light vnsauerye to flit, with gredines, asking. Shee speaks too Barsen thee nurse of seallye Sichœus (For then her owne mylckdame in byrth soyl was breathles abyding) Good nurse take the trauayle, too bring my sister An hither. With the waters streaming let her hoale corps hastlye be clensed. Thee beasts bring she with her, with theym thee forenoted offrings. Thus let her haste hither: let thy pate godlye be coouerd. Too the God infernal what rits bye me bee readye, furth with For to ende I purpose, my troubles wholye to finnish: And toe put in fire brands this Troian pedlerye trush trash. This sayd: shee trots on snayling, lyk a tooth shaken old hagge. But Dido affrighted, stift also in her obstinat onset, Her bluddy eyes wheeling, her lyers with swart spot ydusked, And eke al her visage waning with murther aproching, Too the inner quadrant runneth, then madlye she scaleth Thee top of her bauefyers, his swoord shee grappleth in handling; I say the swoord brandisht, toe such a wild part not apoincted. When she the weeds Troian dyd marck, and sporte breder old bed: In tears salt blubbring, in musing stiddye remayning, Shee fel on her mattresse: theese woords for a farewel awarding. O my sweet old leauings, whilst mee good destenye suffred, And God of his goodnesse you mee too pleasure alowed, Take ye mye faynt spirit, mee from theese troubles abandon, I liu'de and the trauayl, graunted by fortun, I traced: Also my goast shortly too pits of lymboe shal hobble. A citty I founded stately, thee wals dyd J see raysd. And the death of my husband on freendlesse broother I venged. Blessed had I rested, yee thrise most blessed, yf onlye In theese my regions no Troian vessel had anchord. Thus she sayd, and thrusting in couche her phisnomye cheerelesse, But shal I dy sheepe lyke, not taking kindlye reuengment? Yea wil J dy, quod shee, what? so? yea, so wyl I pack hence. Let the cruel Troian, this flame from mayne sea beholding, His panch now satiat, with this my destenye fatal. Thus she sayd; and falling on blade with desperat offer, Her damsels viewd her: thee swoord al bluddye begoared, And hands owt spreadding they beheeld; thee raisd crye doth eccho In the palaice: Rumor thee death through cittye doth vtter. With sighs, with yelling, with skrich, with woommanish howling, Thee rafters rattle: with shouts thee perst skye reboundeth. With no les hudge bawling, than yf al Carthago wer enterd By the enymy riffling, with flaming flasshye toe scorch al Thee roofs of tenements, of Gods thee consecrat howses. Furth runs her sister, theese newes vnfortunat hyring, With nayles hir visadge skratching, and mightilye rapping Her brest with thumping frap knocks, throughrout she doth enter, And the dying sister, with roaring, lowdlye she named. Was this, deere sister, youre drift? therefore ye begyld me? And for theese bancquets made J fiers, and halloed altars? What shal I first mourne now, poore caytief, desolat owtwayle? Jn this youre parting youre sisters coompanye skornd you? Had ye toe that blood shot mee byd: wee both, with one edgtoole, And eke in one moment, oure passadge fatal had ended. This labor endurd I toe this ende? waste therefor I called On Gods, from thye dying sharp pangs to be, wretch cruel absent. The and my self haue J quight forlorne, thee nation hautye Of Sidon, thy woorthye pepil, thy towne braue I batterd. Speedelye bring me water, thee greene wound swiftlye toe souple; And yf in her carcasse soom wind yeet softlye be breathing, With lip J wil nurse yt: thus sayd shee climd toe the woodpile, Claspt in her arms bracing thee panting murtheres haulfquick, With grunt wyde gasping: thee blackned gellyeblud, hardning, Shee skums with napkins; shee would haue lifted her eyebal, Feeble agayne weixing shee droups; thee deadlye push yrcks her. Thrise she dyd endeuoure, too mount and rest on her elbow; Thrise to her bed sliding shee quayls, with whirlygig eyesight Vp to the sky staring, with belling skrichcrye she roareth, When she the desyred soonbeams with faynt eye receaued. Then Iuno omnipotent long pangs, with mercye beholding, And this her hard passadge: dyd send, from propped Olympus, Thee lustring raynebow, from corps thee spirit auoyding, With rustling coombat buckling, with slayne bodye iustling. For where as her parture noe due death, nor destenye caused, But before her season thee wretch through phrensye was ended, Her locks gould yellow therefore Proserpina would not Shaue from her whit pallet, ne her ding too damnable Orcus. Than loa the fayre Raynebow saffronlyke feathered, hoou'ring With thowsand gay colours, by the soon contrarye reshyning, From the skye downe flickring, on her head moste ioyfulye standing, Thus sayd: I doo Gods heast, from corps thy spirit J sunder. Streight, with al, her fayre locks with right hand speedelye snipped: Foorth with her heat fading, her liefe too windpuf auoyded. FINIS. Deo Gratias. Opus decem dierum. HEERE AFTER ENSVE CERTEYN PSALMES OF Dauid, translated in too English, according to thee obseruation of thee Latin verses. THEE FIRST PSALME OF DAVID, named in Latin, Beatus vir, translated in too English Iambical verse. 1 1 That wight is happy and gratious, That tracks noe wicked coompanye; Nor stands in il mens segnorye; In chayre ne sits of pestilence. 2 2But in the sound law of the lord His mynd, or heast is resiaunt: And on the sayd law meditat's, With hourlye contemplation. 3 3That man resembleth verelye The graffe bye riuer situat; Yeelding abundant plentines Of fruict, in haruest seasoned. 4 4With heunlye ioyce stil nurrished His leafe bye no means vannisheth; What thing his hert endeuoureth, Js prosperously accomplished. 5 5Not so the sinful creaturs, Not so there acts are prosperous; But lyke the sand, or chaffye dust, That wynddye pufs fro ground doe blow. 6 6Therefor in houre iudicial, The vngodlye shal vnhaunst remayne; And shal be from the coompanye Of holye men quit sundered. 7 7Because the lord preciselye knows The godlye path of goastlye men; The fleshlye trace of filthye deeds Shal then be cleene extinguished. THEE SECVND PSALME, QVARE fremuerunt gentes, translated in too English Heroical and Elegiacal verse. 1 Wyth franticque madnesse why frets thee multitud heathen? And to vayn attemptings what furye sturs the pepil? 2Al thee worldlye Regents, in clustred coompanye, crowded, For toe tread and trample Christ with his holye godhead. 3Breake we there hard fetters, wee that be in Christian houshold, Also from oure persons pluck we there yrnye yokes. 4Hee skorns thiere woorcking, that dwels in blessed Olympus: And at thiere brainsick trumperye follye flireth. 5Then shal he speake too those in his hard implacabil anger, And shal turmoyle theym, then, with his heauye furye. 6I raigne and doe gouerne, as king, by the lord his apoinctment, Of mount holye Sion; his wyl eke heunlye preaching. 7Thee father hath spoaken: thow art my deerelye begotten; This day thy person for my great issue breding. 8Too mee frame thye prayers, eke of ethnicks the heyre wil I make the, Also toe thy seisin wyde places earthlye giue I. 9With the rod hard steeled thow shalt theyre villenye trample; Lyke potters pypkin naghtye men easlye breaking. 10You that ar earthlye Regents, Iudges terrestrial harcken, With the loare of vertu warelye too be scholed. 11Too God youre seruice with feareful duitye betake yee; With trembling gladnesse yeeld to that highnes honor. 12Lerne wel youre lessons, least that God ruffle in anger, And fro the right stragling, with furye snacht, ye perish. 13When with swift posting his dangerus anger aprocheth, They shal bee blessed which in his help be placed. THEE THIRD PSALME, NAMED, Domine, quid multiplicati sunt, translated in too English Asclepiad verse. 1 Lord, my drirye foes why doe (they) multiplye? Mee for too ruin at sundrye be coouetous. 2Hym shields not the godhead, sundrye say too mye soule. 3Th' art, lord most vigilant, wholye mye succorer, And in the al mye staying shal be stil harbored: Tw' art my moste valiant victorye glorious. 4To our lord lowd I cryed: from holye place herd he mee. 5In graue new buryed fast haue I slumbered. J rose too liefe agayn through God his hollines. 6J feare not furious multitud infinit, With coompasse laboring, my bodye for toe catche. Rise Lord omnipotent, help me, mye champion. 7Lord, thy cleere radiaunt righteus equitye Hath squisd al mye foes, falslye me ransaking. 8Oure Lord participats saulftye with happines: With gifts, heunlye Godhead, thy pepil amplye blisse. THEE FOVRTH PSALME, NAMED, Cum inuocarem, paraphrasticalye translated in too English Saphick verse. 1 When that I called, with an humbil owtcrye, Thee God of Iustice, meriting mye saulftye, In many dangers mye weake hert vpholding Swiftlye dyd hyre mee. 2Therefor al fresly, lyke one oft enured With thye great goodnesse, yet agayne doe craue thee, Mercye too render, with al eeke toe graunt mee Gratius harckning. 3Wherefore of mankind ye that are begotten, What space and season doe ye catche for hardnesse, Uanitee loouing, toe toe fondlye searching Trumperye falshood. 4Know ye for certeyn, that our heunlye rectoure His sacred darling specialye choosed: And the lord therefor, when I pray, wil harcken Too mye requesting. 5For syn expyred se ye rest in anger, And future trespas, with al haste, abandon: When that in secret ye be fleashlye tickled, Run toe repentaunce. 6Righteous incense sacrifice heere after In God, oure guider, your hole hoape reposing. Fondlye doo diuerse say, what hautye great lord Vs doth inhable. 7Thy star of goodnesse in vs is reshining, Sound reason graunting, with al heunlye coomfort: With these hudge presents toe myne hert afurding Gladnes abundant. 8Theare wheat and vineyards, that ar haplye sprouting, And oyle, in plenty toe the store cel hurded, With pryde, and glory to the stars inhaunceth Worldlye men huffing. 9Thogh that J see not, with a carnal eysight, Thee blis and glory, that in heun is harbourd: Yeet with hoape stand I, toe be theare reposed, And toe be resting. 10By reason that thow, my God heunlye, setledst Mee, thye poore seruaunt, in hoape, and that highlye: Too be partaker with al heunlye dwellers Of thye blis happye. A PRAYER TOO THEE TRINITYE. Trinitee blessed, deitee coëqnal, Vnitee sacred, God one eeke in essence, Yeeld toe thy seruaunt, pitifullye calling Merciful hyring. Uertuus liuing dyd J long relinquish, Thy wyl and precepts miserablye scorning, Graunt toe mee, sinful pacient, repenting, Helthful amendment. Blessed I iudge hym, that in hert is healed: Cursed I know hym, that in helth is harmed: Thy physick therefore, toe me, wretch vnhappye, Send, mye Redeemer. Glorye too God, thee father, and his onlye Soon, the protectoure of vs earthlye sinners, Thee sacred spirit, laborers refreshing, Stil be renowmed. Amen. HEERE AFTER ENSVE certayne Poëtical Conceites. A diuise made by Uirgil, or rather by soom oother vpon a Riuer so hard frozen, that waynes dyd passe ouer yt: varyed sundrye wayes, for commendacion, as yt should seeme, of the Latin tongue, and thee same varietye dubled in thee English. THEE SAME ENGLISHED. 1 Wheare ships sayld, the wagons are now drawn stronglye with oxen: For that thee season frostye dyd hold the water. 2Theare the wagon runneth, wheare whillon vessel hath hulled: For that thee marbil frostye made hard the riuer. 3Theare placed is the wagon, wheare boats road grapled at anchour: When that a could wynter thee water hastye stayed. 4Now the car is trayled, wheare barges latelye repayred: When that cold Boreas chillye did hold the riuer. 5Where ships haue trauayled, theare now cars sundrye be tracing: When nipping wynter thee riuer hardlye stoped. 6Theare the coch is running, wheare latelye the nauye remayned: When that the northen frostye gale hemd the riuer. 7Now the naue hath passage, wheare keele was latelye reposed: By reason of wynters frost, that hath hyd the water. 8Thee water vp the wagons dooth prop, that vessel hath harbourd: Beecause that the riuer frostines y sye tyed. 9Now the wagon rowleth, wheare lighturs hulled in hauen: When that a frost knitting stronglye witheeld the riuer. 10Wheare the ship earst sayled, the cart his passage on holdeth: When thee frostye weather thee water hardlye glued. 11Now the wayn is propped, whear to earst thee gallye resorted: For that thee winters hoare glue reteynd the water. SO MANY TYMES IS THE LATIN varyed, and yeet as manye tymes more for the honoure of thee English. 1 Theare chariots doe trauayle, wheare late the great argosye sayled: By reason of the riuer knit with a frostye soder. 2Wheare the great hulck floated, theare now thee cartwheele is hagling: Thee water hard curded with the chil ysye rinet. 3Where skut's furth la?ched, theare now thee great wayn is entred: When the riuer frized by reason of the weather. 4Wheare rowed earst mariners, theare now godye carman abydeth, Thee flud, congealed stifllye, relats the reason. 5Now the place of sayling is turnd to a carter his entrye, This change thee winters chillines hoarye bredeth. 6Now wayns and chariots are drawne, wheare nauye dyd harrow: This new found passadge frostines hoarye shaped. 7Wheare barcks haue passed, with cart's that parcel is haunted: From woonted moysture for that ice heeld the water. 8Wheare stems haue trauersd, there haue oxen traced in headstal: By reason yse knitting thee water heeld froe floing. 9Wheare the flye boat coasted, theare cart wheels clustred ar hobling This new strange passadge winter his hoarnes habled. 10Earst the flud, vpbearing thee ship, now the cartwheele vpholdeth. When water is ioygned firmlye with hoarye weather. 11Whear ruther steered, thee goad theare poaked hath oxen: Thee winters coldnesse thee riuer hardlye roching. Thee description of Liparen, expressed by Uirgil in thee eight booke of his Æneis, in which place, thee Poët played, as yt weare, his price, by aduauncing at ful thee loftines of his veyne: doon in too English by thee translatoure for his last farewel too thee sayd Virgil. Tw'ard Sicil is seated, toe the welken loftelye peaking, A soyl, ycleapt Liparen, from wh?ce, with flownce furye slinging, Stoans, and burlye bulets, lyke tamponds, may nelye be towring. Vnder is a kennel, wheare Chymneys fyrye be scorching Of Cyclopan tosters, with rent rocks chamferye sharded, Lowd dub a dub tabering with frapping rip rap of Ætna. Theare stroaks stronglye threshing, yawl furth groans, stamped on anuyl. In the den are drumming gads of steele, parchfulye sparckling; And flam's fierclye glowing from fornace flasshye be whisking. Vulcan his hoate fordgharth, namde eeke thee Vulcian Jsland. Downe from the heunlye palace trauayled thee fyrye God hither. In this caue the rakehels yrne bars, bigge bulcked, ar hamring. Brotes, and Steropes, with baerlym swartye Pyracmon. Theese thre were vpbotching, not shapte, but partlye wel onward, A clapping fyerbolt (such as oft, with rownce robel hobble, Ioue toe the ground clattreth) but yeet not finnished holye. Three showrs wringlye wrythen glimring, and forceblye sowcing; Three watrye clowds shymring toe the craft they rampyred hizing, Three wheru's fyerd glystring, with Soutwynds rufflered huffling. Now doe they rayse gastly lyghtnings, now grislye reboundings Of ruffe raffe roaring, mens herts with terror agrysing. With peale meale ramping, with thwick thwack sturdelye thundring. Theyre labor hoat they folow: toe the flame fits gyreful awarding. And in an od corner, for Mars they be sternfulye flayling Hudge spoaks and chariots, by the which thee surlye God, angerd, Hastye men enrageth, too wrath towns bat'ful on eggeth. And they be fresh forging toe the netled Pallas an armoure, With gould ritchlye shrined, wheare scaals be ful horriblye clincked Of scrawling serpénts, with sculcks of poysoned adders. Jn brest of the Godesse Gorgon was cocketed hardlye, With nodil vnioyncted, by death, light vital amoouing. Voyd ye fro theese flamfews, quoa the God, set a part the begun wurck. [Vntoe this hard passadge (good God) what phrensye dyd hale mee?] THEE LOOVER LONG SOGHT VNTOO by his fre?d, at last repayreth too her presence: and after a fevv meetinges smelling thee drift of thee moother, vvhich earst hee dyd forcast, too t?d too the preferring of her daughter in marriadge, refrayneth the gentlevvomans coompanye, thogh eft soones too thee contrarye sollicited, as one vnvvylling too marry at al, and verye loath too mar so curteous a dame: and therfor, for thee preseruati? of her honoure, and too auoyd the enco?braunce of looue, hee curbeth affecti? vvith discretion, and thus descanteth on the playne song. Vntoe this hard passadge (good God) what phrensye dyd hale mee? From thye quiet seruice my self too slau'rye betaking. Vntoe the lure smoothly, with faynd solemnitye, trayned. Fiue moonths ful she plyed: means made: dreams sundrye related. Jf we met in walcking, what scarlet blush she resembled? Her color oft altreth: with loou's hoat palsye she trembleth. Back goth her eye glauncing: a sigh herd; moods chaungabil vttred. I litle accoumpted, God knows, thee curtesye proferd. Stil dyd I keepe backward, what J find, tym's sundrye forvttring. For toe loue a stranger, scarce seene, what sound reason egs her? But reason in loouepangs who seeketh? a wooman eke hateth, Or loou's extreemely: no meane, no measure is extant. At length woon bye prayer to her lodge my passage I bended; Lumps of looue promist, nothing perfourmed in earnest. Forgerye thee pandar: thee messadge mockrye: the moother Thee knot of al the lying, thee virgin faultles is onlye. But shal I looue the lady, so as Petrarck Laura regarded? Jn paper her dandling? her person neauer atayning? Such sport fits the Poëts, whom rauing phantasye sotteth. I doe wake, I dreame not: noe such ynckhorne vanitye feeds mee. Thee bodye, not shaddow: no woords, but wurckes I coouet. Marriage is profred: that yoke thee loouer abhorreth. And toe mar a virgin, to a freend such curtesye tendring, Were not a practise honest, nor a preede toe be greatlye recounted. Thee rinet of freendship, vertu, such treacherye damneth. What man of ennye reason with villenye vertue requyteth. Rest the quiet therefore: flee from theese dangerus hard rocks, Whereto loue oft leadeth, with stormes thee passage is haunted. Great trauaylin the sueing, thee profred curtesye skorned. If she coye, that kendleth thee fondling loouer his onset: Greedelye wee coouet, that was to vs flatlye refused. Queynt of a kisse publicque, lewd lust with nicitye masking. Such woomens negatiues for a yeelding, yea Syr, ar holden. What doth auayl, minion, this sleight and treacherye cogging. Cleaue toe the sound Castè, flee from thee patcherye Cautè. Then fresh agayne prayeth hee, percase thee suitur is eared. Wel: the woer gayneth the requyred victorye. What then? Js the trauayl finnisht? are pleasurs onlye then hoouering? Nay: then thy misery, thine hel eeke theare taketh his entraunce. Now thye sleepe is scanted, now stinging ielosye fretteth. Dame Uenus and kingdooms can no riualitye suffer. Her fauor hee gayned with a beck: that burneth in entrayls. Who deems yt wisdoom with glasse too rampyre a Bulwarck? Men say, that a changing of pasture maketh a fat calfe. A Calf yt maketh; toe the fat let a grasier aunswere. That wil a way, who can hold? such challeng therefor abandon. Robbrye toe bee purchase, soom terme eeke leacherye solace. She kept no promise: that would be a quarrel in earnest. Now wars proclaymed, peace agayne now freshlye renewed. Now theese suspicions, now that surmises ar opned. Now beldam Brokresse must bee with moonnye rewarded. Veritye detesting, noght els but vanitye babling. This gowne youre looue mate, that kyrtil costlye she craueth, This pearle, that diamond, this massiue garganet asking. Noght may ye forsake her: that would bee felonye deemed. Ielosye thee person, thee purse eeke penurye pincheth. Is this an heun, trow you? fro that heun Gods mercye wythold mee. Pleasure is vnpleasaunt that purchaseth heauye repentaunce. Jn so much as therefore this great vexation haunteth Al such as are loouers, and wished bootye doe coompasse: I doe renounce flatly thee fielde, such victorye skorning, Too mye fredoom formere my self from slauerye reclayming. AN ENDEVOVRED DESCRIPTION of his Mystresse. Nature in her woorcking soomtyme dooth pinche lyke a niggard, Disfiguring creatures, lyms with deformitye dusking. This man is vnioyncted, that swad lyke a monster abydeth; Shee limps in the going, this slut with a cammoysed hancks nose, And as a Cow wasted plods on, with an head lyke a lutecase. Theese faultes fond Hodipecks impute too Nature, as yf she Too frame were not habil gems with rare dignitye lustring. Wherfor in aduis'ment laboring too cancel al old blots, And toe make a patterne of price, thee maystrye toe pubblish: For toe shape a peerlesse paragon shee mynded, asembling Her force and cunning: for a spirt lands sundrye refusing, And with al her woorckmat's trauayling shee lighteth in Holland, Round too the Hage posting, to the world Marye matchles auauncing. In bodye fine fewterd, a braue Brownnetta; wel handed; Her stature is coomly; not an ynch toe superfluus holding; Gratius in visadge; with a quick eye prittelye glauncing; Her lips lyke corral rudye, with teeth lillye whit eeuened. Yoong in age, in manners and nurture sage she remayneth; Bashful in her speaking; not rash, but watchful in aunswer; Her look's, her simpring, her woords with curtesye sweetning; Kynd and also modest; lyking with chastitye lyncking; And in al her gesturs obseruing coomlye Decorum. But toe what eend labor J, me toe presse with burden of Ætna: Thee stars too number, poincts playnely vncounctabil opning. Whust: not a woord: a silence such a task impossibil asketh. Her vertu meriteth more prayse, than parlye can vtter. HIS DEVISE WRYTTEN in his mystresses booke. THEE SAME ENGLISHED. Thee fine Hage excelleth with lusturs sundrye reshyning, Thee Sun hath his brightnesse in Marye solye placed. THREE ESPECIAL GIFTES, wherein his mystresse excelleth. Three poincts my mystresse with passing dignitye garnish. Coomlynes of person thee first ranck rightlye reteigneth: Curtesye keeps the Secund: thee third row Chastitye claymeth: For so fayre a Paragon, with booxom deboynar vsadge; And so pure a Virgin, with so rare vertue bedecked: Sundrye may wel wish for. Marye must be the Principal holden. OF A CRAKING CVTTER, extracted owt of Syr Thomas Moore his Latin Epigrams. Linckt was in wedlock a loftye Thrasonical huf snuffe: Jn gate al on typstau's stalcking, in phisnomye daring. This cutter valiant in warfare soght his auenture. Thee whilst his minion, with carnal wantones itching, Chooste for a freend secret no woorse, then a countrye lob heerd swayne. A pray for a paragon: but what? thee knurrye knob oake tree, Thogh craggy in griping, in strength surpasseth a smooth slip. When Thraso from bickrings, not bluddye, returned is homeward, Of this hap aduertisde, with frantick iellosye taynted, Hee seeks in thee fields, with swift enquirye, the riual. Stay vagabund raskal (so he spake when he spyde the lob heerd hyne) Thee clowne stout standeth with a leshe of bulleted hard stoans; Then Thraso with naked flatchet, with thunderus owtcrye Sayd: thow scuruye peasaunt, my wiefe th' hast, villen, abused. My bed defiled: lyke a breaklooue mak'bat adultrer. Al this J deny not, quoa the clowne: and what then: I pray thee? Doost thow confesse yt? Thraso sayd: bye the blessed asemblye Of the heunly sociats, hadst thow thy knauerye reneaged, This mye blade in thye body should bee with speedines hafted. OF A TEMPEST QVAYLING certeyn passengers borowed of thee same Syr Thomas Moore. Theare rose in sayling a rough tempestuus owtrage, With watrye plash bouncing, thee ribs of giddye ship hitting. Thee mariners fearing, al hoap eeke of salftye reiecting, Sayd: that a bad liuing eke a bad death rightlye requyred. Al that are in passadge to a munck, father holye, resorted, Who was eke embarcked, to hym theyre confession opning. Howbeyt thee stormy ruffling is no whit abated; But thee rough billows the ship toe toe terriblye charged. Twish, what woonder is yt, quod one of thee coompanye, chauffing, Yf that thee vessel with weight moste sinful is heauye. Duck we the munck therefor, that al oure falts wholye receaued, Hastlye let hym toe the seas oure syns and villenye carrye. Al they be contented, thee munck they spedelye plunged: Ceast was thee tempest, yf truth bee truelye related. Heereby wee be scholed, what poyse sin ponderus holdeth, That with an hudge and weightye balas surchargeth a vessel. HESPERVS HIS CONFESSION, written in Latin by the Sayd Syr Thomas Moore. Hesperus his faulty liuelood too cal toe recounting Mynding, too be shriuen with woont accustomed hastned. When that he told playnely, what crym's most sinful he practisd, Yeet thee goastlye father laboring more deepelye toe ransack His formere liuing; by distinct article asked Eu'rye syn, and naming by peecemeal curius eche fault, At leingth demaunded, wheather, with sorcerye blinded, Erst he beleefe yeelded toe the bugs infernal? here aunswerd Hesperus: holye father, doe ye thinck me soe madlye bewitched Too beleue in the deuils? I tel you truelye, toe great payn's Stil I take enduring, in God yeet scantlye beleeuing. OF TYNDARVS, THAT FRVMPED a gentlewoman for hauing a long nose, deliuered by the former author in Latin. Tyndarus attempting too kis a fayre lasse with a long nose, Would needs bee finish, with bitter frumperye taunting. Jn vayn I doo coouet my lips too linck toe thye sweete lips, Thy nose, as a stickler, toe toe long vs parteth a sunder. Heere the mayd al bashful, the vnsau'ry saucines heeding: With choler oppressed, thus shrewdlye toe Tyndarus aunswerd, Syth mye nose owtpeaking, good syr, your liplabor hindreth, Hardlye ye may kisse mee, where no such gnomon apeereth. SYR THOMAS MOORE HIS receipt for a strong breath translated owt of his Latin Epigrames. First for a strong sauoure stincking, a leeke may be taken: That sent too bannish, thee best is an Onion eaten. And toe repeal lykwise that sauoure, garlik is holsoom. Jf that theese simples wyl not thee filthod abandon, A rose, or els nothing that drafty infirmitye cureth. HEERE AFTER ENSVE CERTEYN Epitaphes framed as wel in Latin as English. VPON THEE DEATH OF THEE right honourable and his moste deere coos?, thee lord Baron of Louth, who was trayterouslye murthred by Mackmaughoun, an Irish Lording, about thee yeere 1577. Thus loa, thyne hast (coosen) bred waste too cittye, toe country. Thee bearbrat boucher thy corps with villenye mangled. Not by his manlye valour, but through thy desperat offer. As the liefe is lasting too sutch, as in armes ar heedye, Eun so death is posting too those, that in armor ar headye. Haulfpenye, far better then an housful cluster of angels, Althogh habil, would not fro thye danger deadlye be parted. Whom lief combyned death could not scatter a sunder. Sutch is thee fastnesse of foster brootherhod Irish. Thogh Sydny and Deluyn thee murther partlye reuenged: A losse so pretiouse may not bee fully requited. Thee death of a thowsand Maghouns is vnequal amendment. Thee nobles may not but a death so bluddye remember, Thee Plunckets wyl not from mynd such boutcherye bannish. Thy Ladye, thy kinred doo misse thy freendship aprooued; Thee cittee mourneth the lack of a counsalor holsoom; And thee countrye moneth thee want of a zealus vpholder; Vertu eeke lamenteth thee lack of an holye repentaunt. How beyt dame Uertu thy goodnesse kindlye rewardeth, In memory thin honour, thy soul eeke in glorye reposing. VPON THEE DEATH OF THEE right honourable thee Lord Girald fitz Girald L. Baron of Offalye, who deceased at S. Albans in thee yeere 1580. thee last of Iune, thee xxj. yeere of his adge. Soomtyme liu'lye Girald in graue now liu'les is harbourd. A matchlesse gallant, in byrth and auncetrye nobil. His nobil linnadge Kyldaer with Mountegue warrants. Proper in his person, with gyfts so hym nature adorned. In valor and in honor, wel knowne too no man vnequal. And a true sound subiect, to his Prince most faythful abyding. Theese not with standing his liefe too to hastelye vannisht. Nipt were thee blossooms, eare fruictful season aproched. Wherefor his acquayntaunce his death so vntymelye bewayleth. Maynoth lamenteth, Kilka and Rathangan ar howling. Nay rather is mated bye this hard hap desolat Ireland. Such claps of batter that seally vnfortunat Island. O that I thy prayses could wel decipher in order, Lyke Homer or Virgil, lyke Geffray Chauncer in English: Then would thy Stanyhurst in pen bee liberal holden. Thee poët is barrayn, for prayse rich matter is offred. Heere percase carpers wyl twight his iollitye youthful. Strong reason vnstrayned that weake obiection aunswers. Hee must bee peerlesse who in yong yeers faultles abydeth. Such byrds flee seldoom, such black swans scantlye be floating. Jn world of mischiefe who finds such glorius angels? Soom stars passe oothers; al perls doe not equalye luster. Thee soundest wheatcorne with chaffy filthod is husked: What shal I say further, this loare diuinitye telleth; Vertuus hee liued, through grace that vertuus eended. What may be then better, than a godly and gratius vpshot? Too God in al pietee, too Prince in dutye remayning. Whearefor (woorthye Girald) syth thy eend was hertye repentaunce, Thy soul God gladdeth with saincts in blessed Olympus, Thogh tumbd bee carcasse in towne of martyred Alban. A PENITENT SONNET WRITTEN by thee Lord Girald a litle beefore his death. By losse in play men oft forget Thee duitye they dooe owe, Too hym that dyd bestow thee same, And thowsands millions moe. J loathe too see theym sweare and stare, When they the mayne haue lost; Forgetting al thee byes, that weare With God and holye goast. By wounds and nayles they thinck too wyn, But truely yt is not so: For al theyre frets and fumes in syn, They mooniles must goa. Theare is no wight that vsd yt more, Then hee that wrote this verse; Who cryeth, peccaui, now therefore His othes his hert doe perce. Therefor example take by mee, That curse thee lucklesse tyme; That eauer dice myne eyes dyd see, Which bred in mee this crime. Pardon mee for that is past, I wyl offend no more: In this moste vile and sinful cast, Which I wyl stil abhore. AN EPITAPH ENTITVLED Commune Defunctorum, such as oure vnlearned Rythmours accustomablye make vpon thee death of euery Tom Tyler, as yf yt were a last for euerye one his foote, in which thee quantitees of syllables are not too bee heeded. Coom toe me, you muses, and thow most chieflye, Minerua, And ye that are dwellers in dens of darckned Auerna: Help mye pen in wryting, a death moste soarye reciting, Of the good old Topas, soon too thee mightye syr Atlas. For grauitee the Cato, for wyt Mars, Bacchus, Apollo: Scipio for warfare, for gentyl curtesye Cæsar. A great Alexander, with a long whit neck lyke a gaunder. In yeer's a Nestor, for wars a martial Hector, Hannibal and Pompey, with Tristram, Gallahad, Orckney: Hercules in coasting, a Vulcan mightelye toasting. In wisdoom Salomon, for streingth and currag a Sampson. For iustice Radamanthus: in equitye woorthye Lycurgus. And not a Thersites, but he was a subtil Vlisses. In learning Socrates, in faythful freendship Achates. Yea, thogh he stand namelesse, hee was in prowes Achilles. A Damon and Pythias, for gould and silver a Midas. Noe for continuance, a learned Tullie for utt'raunce. In travaile Ænas, for secrets trustful Iollas And in philosopy, a Raymond, a Bacon, a Ripply, In medicins Pæon, Galen, and most famosed Alcon, Plinie, Dioscorides, Hipocrates, and Arafornes, O you cursd Parcas, why kyld ye the good soon of Atlas? And whye, withowt mercy, doe ye slea thee fayre ladye Thisbee? A Sara for goodnesse, a greate Bellona for hudgnesse. For myldnesse Anna, for chastitye godlye Susanna. Hester in a good shift, a Iudith stout at a dead lift. Also Iulietta, with Dido, rich Cleopatra. With sundry namelesse, and woomen more manye blamelesse. Is not he wel garded, thee wooman richlye rewarded? AN EPITAPH WRYTTEN BY SYR Thomas More vpon thee death of Henrye Abyngdon, one of thee gentlemen of thee chappel: which deuise thee authour was fayne too put in meeter, by reason thee partye that requested his trauaile, dyd not lyke of a verye proper Epitaph that was first framd, beecause yt ran not in rythme, as may appeere at ful in his Latin Epigrammes: where vpon Syr Thomas More shapte theese verses ensuing, with which thee suppliant was exceedinglye satisfyed, as yf thee author had hyt thee nayle on the head. Thee same thogh not verbatim construed, yeet in effect thus may [illeg.]w Heere lyeth old Henry, no freend to mischeeuus enuy. Surnamd Abyngdon, to al men most hartily welcoom. Clerck he was in wellis, where tingle a great many bellis. Also in thee chappel hee was not counted a moungrel: And such a lowd singer, in a thowsand not such a ringer. And with a concordance, a man moste skilful in organce. Now God J craue duly: sence this man saru'd the soe truelye, Henrye place in kingdoom,, that is also named Abyngdon. FINIS.</field>
