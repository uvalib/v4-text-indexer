      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATORY SONNET, TO L?????? J????? SO swiftly, silently, have stolen along The steps of Time, that years have passed away Since I was wont on Orwell's banks to stray, And find a home amid her busy throng How shall I then, my lovely friend, among Her Fair, discover one to whom I may Inscribe this tribute to her festive day, Unless to Thee I dedicate the Song? Then, be it thine!âthy love of Poesy, Influence of local ties,âhave made it so: And if another reason I must show, I have a foolish one, yet dear to me; For the initials to these lines prefix'd, With Memory's brightest, darkest dreams are mix'd. PREFATORY STANZAS. DAUGHTERS of Orwell! you to whom The stream I sing hath long been known; Who prize its banks when Spring's gay bloom In lavish loveliness is shown;â Or Summer's radiance rests upon Its breast, with bright and dazzling beam; Or Autumn's tints, of tenderer tone, Along its borders richly gleam:â By whom but you should Orwell's praise Be welcom'd with indulgent ear? From whom should minstrel, who essays To tell its triumphs, hope to hear Those plaudits, to the Poet dear, But You?âthen while the strain I wake, With favouring smiles vouchsafe to hear, Not for my own, but Orwell's sake. So may you, many a future Spring, Behold its beauteous banks supplied With renovated charms, which bring Admiring strangers to its side. Or when the Summer's fervid pride Invites you on its waves to sail; Be it yours to skim its flowing tide With sky serene, and gentle gale. Or if mild Autumn's mellow eve Should lure you on its banks to stray, Just when the sun is taking leave, And sheds aslant his softest ray On groves, and gardens, late so gay, Where varying tints still richly shine, And pensive gleams of brightness play, Attendant on the day's decline;â Then in that calm and peaceful hour, May you with chasten'd feelings bless The dear delight, the silent power, Of Nature's fading loveliness! And gazing, gratefully confess In voiceless extasy, how dear, Far dearer than the gay can guess, The parting glories of the year. Nor think such feelings will expire When wintry storms obscure the sky; No: oft beside the social fire Shall Memory bring them to your eye; And lonelier hours glide swiftly by, Beguil'd by those which sped before them, Fancy shall make you feel them nigh, And Hope shall whisper, âI'll restore them.â THE TRIUMPH OF THE ORWELL. NOW Orwell spread thy sparkling waves In triumph to the sun; And, where old ocean hoarsely raves, Proclaim the wreath thou'st won. Thine is no puny, limpid stream, Where boats alone may glide; Or fairies, by the moonlight beam, In tiny skiffs may ride. And yet, between the crowded spot Where Gipping joins with thee, And Ocean; scenes not soon forgot, Are scatter'd lavishly. For many an exquisite recess Thy wooded banks display; Some lovely in their loneliness, And some as bright and gay. But these are not my present theme; For Fancy turns her eye, To times far distant; when thy stream, Bore armed gallies by. When âHenry, the son of Henry II who was crowned in his Father's life time, when he conspired against his Father, landed here with Soldiers from Flanders; and taking Hugh Bigod with him, marched from hence to Norwich. Here too, Isabel, wife of King Edward II, landed from France, when she droye her Husband into Wales.â Kirby's Suffolk Traveller. Henry waged unnatural war; And Edward's faithless Queen Forgot the loyalty she swore; Thou show'dst another scene. Then, mingled with thy sable barks, âIpswich Catsâ were certain huge vessels, which were formerly employed in the coal-trade here. They were of large tonnage, and of immense bulk. Of strange and uncouth Name; 'Mid shady groves, and princely parks, Sail'd prince, and princely dame. Not as Eliza From âQueen Elizabeth's Progresses,â edited by John Nichols, we learn that Queen Elizabeth, honoured Ipswich several times with her presence. That she sailed down the Orwell may be inferred from the following entry in Mr. Bacon's Manuscript Aunals of Ipswichâ Tewsday, 17 July Perambulacion liberty by water with the Queen. âThere shall be two vessels or botes decently furnished, to attend upon the Queen's Majestie soe farre as the Liberty doe extend.â stemm'd thy tide, In peaceful pomp alone; But bearing up in martial pride And breathing warlike tone. Then on thy peaceful banks were heard The trump and clarion shrill; And strife's discordant echoes stirr'd Thy scenes so sweetly still. Enough of theseâfrom them we turn To one, who on thy tide, Perchance in boyish days might learn His buoyant boat to guide. And shame it were, if in a lay To praise of thee devoted, His name, so famous in its day, Should pass the bard unnoted. Candish! Thomas Cavendish, or Candish, of Trimly, was the second Englishman that circumnavigated the globe. The success of his first expedition, which he accomplished in two years and fifty days, (for an account of which vide Hackluyt's collection of voyages) induced him to set sail on a second in August 1591âIt was as disastrous as his first had been successful; and the uncertainty in which its ultimate result is involved, adds to its melancholy interest. thou enterprizing tar, Could verse of mine dispel The clouds which veil'd thy setting star, Its triumphs I would tell. Though little of thy life be known, And of its end still less; Both touch a melancholy tone Of pansive tenderness! And he who wakes a votive strain To Orwell's lovely stream, May be excused if he would fain Combine thee with his theme. Who knows how often in the hour; The brightest life can lend, When boyhood's dreams, by magic power, With manhood's business blend; Who knows how oft by Orwell's side Were felt the early force Of enterprizing hopes; the guide Of thy uncertain course? And though thy comet-like career Was marked by ruthless spoil; At least it knew not coward fear, Nor turn'd aside from toil. Brilliant and brief thy course; its end To mortal eye unknown; Conjecture vainly would pretend To make thy history shown. Whether in harbour far remote Thy bark a home might gain; Or fate its fragments doom'd to float In ruin o'er the main: Whate'er the fate of that; or thee; No stone records thy name; Let ocean thy mausoleum be! Thy epitaph; thy fame! Peace to the wandering seaman!âTurn From him, and Orwell's flood, To where her children, brave and stern Their fearless trade pursued. Ipswich formerly employed vessels in the Whale-Fishery: the large building at Nova Scotia, in which the business of cutting up the Whale, and extracting the oil was carried on, is still remaining. Where 'gainst the monarch of the deep, They once were wont to urge Their desperate warfare; and to steep With blood the foamy surge. Where, amid polar ice and snow, They brav'd the dangerous strife; And, by the oft repeated blow, Bereav'd the whale of life. What boots to paint the dreadful scene? The giant's awful size; The fearful, silent pause between His sinking and his rise: Between the moment when, with ire, He dives below the main; And when, arising to respire, He feels the dart again. O! different far the ocean-king, Alive, and roused to rage; From that unwieldy, putrid thing, On Tuesday, Nov. 5th, 1816, was found off the Buoy of the Rough, near Harwich, a dead female Whale, which on Thursday was towed up the Orwell as high as Dunham Reach. Its length was from 68 to 70 feet, and the diameter of its body about 18.âAlmost the whole population of Ipswich, Men, Women and Children, as well as great numbers from the vicinity, flocked to see this immense native of the Ocean. The Author begs pardon for alluding to the only unpleasant circumstance attendant on this exhibition; but he was informed by one on the spot, that the countenances of some of the more delicate among the female spectators, led him to doubt, whether the gratification of their optics, or the annoyance of their olfactories, was predominant. Which pleas'd our latter age. Which decomposing by degrees, Sweet Orwell, on thy shore, Impregnated each passing breeze With stench unknown before. Yet, such the universal wish To see a sight so rare; That thousands flock'd to view the fish, In spite of poison'd air. E'en female nicety stood by, Though reeking perfumes rose; Wisely resolv'd to please the eye At peril of the nose. Yet deem not that the Bard would dare To write of dames with spleen; He only hints what dames can bear, To see! and to be seen! And now, fair Orwell! of the past No more: I have but time, A hasty glance o'er all to cast; The present claims my rhyme. And well thy present honours might A loftier Bard provoke To hymn thy praise; and with delight, A loftier Muse invoke. But since 'tis better badly done, Than not perform'd at all; The wreath which thou hast lately won, I'll sing, whate'er befall. Bayley! whatever honours league, Whatever glories shine, Combin'd in Barnard, or in Teague; Barnard, and Teague were both eminent Shipbuilders at this Port. They still must yield to thine. Nay, e'en our last year's whale itself, Though monstrous was its fame; Is fairly laid up on the shelf, And grants oblivion's claim. For Thou, by Orwell's side hast rais'd A wonder, larger still; By staring passengers beprais'd, And fram'd with wondrous skill. Who for dead whales would care a fig, And rather not be glad, To look on something much more big, Which stinks not half so bad. Well;âsetting joking all apart, Allow me to present A tribute to thy powerful art, If poor, at least well meant. And let us hope that âempty praiseâ May not alone accrue From this vast feat; but may it raise Thee, âsolid puddingâ too. Thanks to thy prowess, Orwell, now With Thames and Mersey vies; And neighbouring Shires are forc'd to bow To Suffolk enterprise. And doubt not, when our gallant bark Shall sail on seas afar, In favouring breeze, in tempest dark, Whate'er her guiding star, Prosp'rous, or adverse;âfor her weal Shall wishes oft ascend; And for her sake shall many feel The interest of a friend. Now, Orwell! stream so long belov'd; Though now but seldom seen; By whose lone banks I oft have rov'd, Beneath the wild-wood green; Orwell! ere yet I bid adieu, One wish for thee I'll frame, As fond, as tender and as true, As stream from Bard can claim. Peace to thy waters! prosp'rous gales To every bark of thine; Which way soe'er it waft their sails O be that breeze benign! Fresh be the foliage of thy woods, And flourishing each bough; May health glow in thy briny floods To those who stem them now. Green be thy lawns, thy parks, thy meads, As now, to memory's eye, The picture on which fancy feeds Of brightest, softest dye. And may thy Sons renown'd for arts, And manly virtues be; Thy Daughters blest with happy hearts, And lovely still as thee!</field>
