      <field name="fulltext">Here begynneth a plesaunt treatyse of the smyth that brent hys dame and after forged her agayne by the helpe of our blessed lorde. Here begynneth a treatyse of the smyth whych that forged hym a new dame. God that dyed on a tree, He glad them al with his gle That wyll herken unto me And here what I wyll say: And ye shall here a marvel, Of a tale I shall you tell, How in Egypt it befell. And in that same countraye Some tyme ther dwelled a smyth, That hath bothe lande and lyth, Many a plowman hym wyth, By nyght and eke by day. The smyth was a subtyll syer, For well could he werke wyth the fyer What men of hym wolde desyerâ I tel you trouth, by my fay! He coude werke wyth a mall Many maner of metall. Hymselfe mayster dyd he call Wythouten any pere. Moche boste gan he blowe And sayd he had no felowe That coud worke worth a strawe To hym, ferre nor nere; He called hymselfe the kynge, Wythout any leasynge, Of all maner of cunnynge, And of certes clere. Tyll it befell upon a day Our lorde came thereaway And thought the smyth to assay, As ye shall after here. For hys pompe and hys pryde That he blewe in eche syde, Our lorde thought at that tyde His pryde should be layed. As the smyth stode workynge, To hym came our heaven kynge, âNow he that made all thynge, Spede the!â he sayde, He sayd: âI have a thyng to make; And thou wylt it undertake And do for my sake, Thou shalt be well payed.â The smyth sayd: âSo mote I the, Tell on and let me se! It shal be done full wyghtely Wythin a lyttel brayed. For I am mayster of all That smyteth wyth hamer or mall, And so may thou me call, I tell the for veray: I sawe hym never wyth myne eye That could werke lyke I, I tell the full truely, By nyght ne by day.â âCan thou make a yerde of stele, To lede a blynde man weleââ Our lorde gan to say, âAnd make it so wyth thy mall, That he shall never stomble ne fall? Than a mayster I wyll the call, Syr, by my fay!â The smyth than in a stody stode, Sayde: âI trowe thou be wode, Or els thou can but litle good, To talke of suche a thynge! And he be blynde, he must nede Have a felowe, hym to lede, That may se well indede, To kepe hym fro fallynge. For, and two blynd men together go, Full oft they fall bothe twoâ It must nedes be so: They have no maner of seynge. How should a blynde dotarde Walke wyth a blynd yarde, If it be stele never so harde? It is but a very leasynge. It were a(s) lytell maystry To make a blynde man to se As suche a yerde truely, Wythouten any layne.â âYes, sayde oure lorde, that I can: Make suche yerde, certayne, Or he that is an olde man To make hym yonge agayne.â The smyth sayd: âSo mote I the, I have an olde quayne wyth me, Myne olde beldame is she, I tell the, wythout any layne; It is forty wynter and mo Syth on fote she dyd go; And thou could make her yonge so, Than wolde I be fayne.â Oure lorde sayd: âWhere is she? Anone let me her se, And thou shalt se a maystre More than thou can.â The smyth sayd: âSo mote I the, I shall her fetche unto the.â Anone than full wyghtely After her the smyth ranne, And sayd: âDame, slepest thou? I am come for the: thou mayest me trowe, Thou shalt be made nowe Agayne a yonge woman.â He hent her up than on hye: Than set she forth a loude cry And sayd: âStronge thefe, let me ly! Thou art, I trowe, a madde man. Lette me lye, thou unthryfty swayne!â Verse in square brackets from l. 114â154 is from another ms. [âNay, dame! withouten ony layne Thou shalte be made yonge agayneâ Thou arte a very olde trote.â To our lorde than he hyr bore And sayde: âsyr, loo, I haue broughte hyr here. Thou maye se by hyr chere That she is chekmate.â Oure lorde sayde: âgode syre, Hye the faste and make a fyre, And blowe gladly for thy hyre!â Than began she to grone And lowde out to crye, Sayde: âI forfende you to-daye Ony handes on me to ley. What, wyll ye bren me? Fye on you, fye! Out, theues! wyll ye me kyll? Lete god on me worke his wyll! Ye shall be hanged on a hyll. I am fyue-score yere olde, Yet lyue lenger I wolde. Howe dare ye be so bolde With me thus for to fare?â âHowe, quod our lorde to the smyth, Thou canste beste dele her with: Lay hyr vpon the styth Without ony more stryfe!â The smyth toke hyr vp tyte. Tho began she to byte] âShe shall be made at a brayd Yonge now agayne.â The smyth blewe, as god bed, Tyll she was reed as a gled; Yet for all that dede Felt she no maner of payne. The smyth said: âNow is she shent: Bothe her eyen are out brent; They wyl never be ment, Our workes are all in vayne. She hath had suche a hete: She wyll never eat mete; I have blowen tyll I swete, Withouten any layne.â Our lorde sayd: âLet me alone! Thou shalt se, and that anone, A full fayre woman Of thys olde wyghtâ. Our lord blessed her at a brayd And on the styth he her layd, âTake thy hamer, he sayd, And make her now ryght! âDame, I shall the wakeâ. Wyth a hamer he her strake, No bone of her he brake: She was a byrd bryght. âStand up now, lette me se!â Than at that worde rose she, A fayre woman, truely, And semely unto syght. Our lord sayd to the smyth: âShe is sounde of lymme and lyth, Nowe I have made her on the styth Wyth hamer and wyth mallâ. Than was she lovesome of chere, Bright as blosome on brereâ None in Egypt her pere, So fayre and so tall; Her colour was clere, She semed but thyrty yere, She was whiter of lere Than bone is of whale. Than our lorde gan say: âNow is here a fayre may! Smyth, by night and by day Thy mayster thou me call! Now mayest thou se here in syght Hole and of lym lyght That was before an olde wyght, Both croked fote and handeâ. âGramercy, syr, sayd she, For thou hast wrought on me, It was a full great maystry, As I understande. I was blynde, now may I se; Croked I was truely, Now may I walke wyghtly; My bales are unbande. Suche a smyth as thou art one, I dare say, here is none, And a man shoulde gone Throughout thys land. For I dare say that thou can, Yf here were a dead man, Make hym on lyve anone With thy excelent maystryâ. Than the smyth gan say: âSyr, what shall I to the pay, Or thou wende thy way, Thy craft to teche me?â Our lord sayd than to him againe: âThat thou desyrest, is all in vayne; Thought thou woldest never so faine, Yet wyl it never be; Thou shalt never, yf thou wolde, Make an yonge man of an olde. Therfore be not to bolde, Leest it do disceyve thee! Yet thou toldest me long ere Thou were wysest man of leere That was knowen any-where, Other farre or els nere! Farewell now and have good day! I must forthe wende on my jorney Into another countrey Amonge many craftes there. And leve thy bostes, I rede the! For I tell the now treuely: Is none so wyse ne to sle But ever ye may somwhat lereâ.â Now lysten, syrs, at asent, And ye wil now my tale tent, How the smith hys dame brent In the next fyt ye shall here. The seconde fytte. Whan our lorde was gone, The smyth rathely and anone Called on hys dame Jone And bad her com on fast. Anone she aunswered tho: âThou wotest I may not go, Wherto cryest thou so? Is thy wytte past? I am croked and also lame, And now to go it is no shame(!), Age doth me muche grame, Me thynketh my bones brast. Thou wotest well I may no(t) se, Almost I am as blynde as a be; And yf I bye me, truely, To fall I am agastâ. The smyth hande on her layd: âCome forth, dame! he sayd, Thou shalt be made at a brayd Younge and lusty agayne. Thy dame is yonge agayne, i-wys, She is mended of her mysse, Her rudde redder it is Than the rose is in rayneâ. âThat is a lye, quod she, I fayth, that wyl never be! She is blynde of that one eye, Her bones are unbayneâ. The smyth sayd: âLo! she is here, The swete dame that the bere: She is lovesome of chere, Wythouten any layneâ. âArt thou my mother?â sayd she. âYeâ, sayd she, âtruelyâ. Than sayd she: âBenedicite! Who hath made the thus?â Anone to her gan she say: âI was made thus to-daye Wyth one that came by the waye, Men call hys name Jesusâ. âNow truely, than sayd she, He hath amended well thy ble; For yesterday, so mote I the, Thou were a foule soseâ. âDame, sayd the smyth tho, I can make the yonge so, Had I a fyre brennynge blo. But now thou must helpe usâ. Than the smyth at a brayed A quarter of coles on he layed: âLet us blowe nowe, he sayed, Tyl all be on glede! And thou shalt se, dame, in hy A crafte for the maystry; Full fewe men can it but I, I tell the trouthe, indedeâ. âWhy, what wylt thou do with me?â âDame, brenne theâ sayd he. âNay, not so, sayd she, Chryst it forbede! To brenne me, were a shrewde game: Wottest not thou, knave, whome I am? Thefe, I am thyne owne dame! Evyll mote thou spede! Traytour, and thou brenne me, Thou shalt be hanged on a tree. My malyson I gyve thee, Woldest thou me slo: God let thee never eate brede, Woldest thou have thy dam dede. Touche me not, I the rede, For bothe thyne eyen two! The fyrst tyme I thee see, I wolde I had throtled thee, Now thou woldest brenne me And werke me thys wo! I tell thee, by sweete saynt John, Thou shalt have my malyson, But thy hamer anone Thou cast thee fro. Moche wo hast thou wrought; I kept the when thou were nought, Fostred and forth the brought, Full oft dyd I wakeâ. âDame, sayd the smyth, I trowe, Olde shrewe, it is for thy prowe That on thys wyse nowe Yonge I shall thee make. Anone se that thou shall: Had I my hamer and mi mall, I wolde make the full tall And yonge, I undertakeâ. He layed hande on her tho. Than she spurned at hym so That hys shynnes bothe two In-sonder she there brake. Than the smyth began to stare And sayd: âGod gyve the care! What aylest thee thus to fare? I trowe thou art wode! Yonge ful soone I can make thee, And that anone thou shalt se; I am waxen now full crafty, I tell thee, by the rode! Thou spendest now and mai not pay, Thou hast lyen full many a day By the wall, for sothe I thee say, And can do no goodâ. Full fast the fyre gan he blow, And sayd: âBe thou never so throw, I shal amende the sonne, I trow, Of bone and eke of bloudâ. She sayde: âSyr, by saynt Jhone, Of thy mendyng kepe I none. Therfore let me alone And touche me no more!â âYes, sayde he, that I mote. Come forthe, olde dote!â She catched hym by the throte, That bloud out gan fare. As he drew her nere, She set her fote agaynst a spere, And sayd: âThefe, wylt thou me dere? God gyve the care!â He cast her on the smythes stocke, And than she hent hym by the locke And gave hym many a great knocke, She spared not the bare. Ever she sporned wyth her fote; In hande a hamer she gate And knocked hym above the pate: The bloud gan out-brast. And she carped at hym then, âStrong thefe, she sayd, I shall the ken Thyne owne dame for to brenne!â She bette upon him fast. There she had welny Stryken out his one eyeâ Though the smyth bygge be, Of her he was abasshed. Stefly on her fete she stode And smote on him as she were wode; The smyth ranne on reed blode, All to-rent and rasshed. The smyth at a brayd Wolde her in the fyre have layd. âNay, thefe, tho she sayd, Yet wyl I not come there. âHelpe, some good man, sayd she, Thys thefe wyl brenne me!â Anone than full myghtely She caught hym by the heer; Of his lockes gan she pull Many great handfull, Rent the skyn from the skull, The pan gan appeare. She sayd: âThefe, lette me go! Wylt thou thy dame slo?â Loude out cryed she tho, That many a man myght here. The smyth than in hast Water on the coles cast, The fyre he blewe full fast And made it brenne full bryght. The smyth, angred wyth that, Cast her in the fyre flat; All-way fast gan she scrat At hym wyth all her myght. Into the fyre he her thrast And sayd: âI holde thy wytte past. Olde shrowe, at the last Thou shalt be newe dyghtâ. Whan he had smored her in the smok, Out of the fyre he her toke: She had none eyen for to loke, For lost was her syght. He laide her on the stythe alonge And wyth an hamer he on throng, That both her armes of spronge. Than waxed he unfayne, And sayd: âSo ever eate I meate, Thou shalt have a better heateâ. Mo coles gan he gete, To blowe he was full fayne. The fyre sparkeled and spronge, He cast on water sometymes amonge, And sayd: âYet I hope to make the yonge, Wythout any layneâ. Than he hent her up on hy And layed her on the stethy And hamered her strongely With strokes that were ungayne. Fast on her he layed, âWaxe yong, dame!â he sayd. Than bothe her legges at a brayd Fell sone her fro. âWhat, evyll hayle! sayd he, Wylt not thou yonge be? Speke now, let me se, And say ones bo!â Than he toke her by the heed And sayd: âDame, art thou deed? Speke now in thys steed And say ye or els nay! Though both thy legges be awai, Yet speke, pardy, thou may. Say on, dame, I the pray, Felest thou any wo? Dame, I have lost on the Moche labour truely; Now and thou deed be, So fayre must me befallâ. Loud on her he can cry And sayde: âDame, speke on hye, Or by my trouth, truely Brenne thee up I shall. What? canst thou nothyng say? I holde thee deed by this dayâ. Her arme anone he threw away Even agaynst the wall. And lyghtly his way he went than, After Jesu fast he ran, As he had ben a madde man, And full fast kan hym call, And sayd: âFor saynt charyte, Abyde nowe and speke wyth me! But thou me helpe, truely, My c[illeg.]es are full colde. My owne dame I have slayne, I wolde have made her yonge agayneâ All my laboure was in vayne, Her legges wolde not holdeâ. Our lorde sayd verament: âHast thou thy dame brent?â He sayd: âLorde, she is shent, But yf thou helpe woldeâ. Our lorde sayd: âGo we full yare. Yet I bad the longe eare Of suche craft to beware And be not to bolde!â âA, good lorde, sayd he, I crye the hartely mercy; I wolde have wrought after the And learned of thy loreâ. Sayd our lorde: âGo thy way! Now thou doest me pray, I shall helpe that I maye Her for to restoreâ. Anone as he her se, He blessed her full fayrely And bad her stande upon hy: Anone she rose up there. She semed younge and not olde, Bryght as blossome her to beholde, Fayrer by a thosand folde Than she was before; She was whyte as a bone of whale, Bryghter then berall. Than to the earth gan she fall And thanked god intere. The smyth had good game And fetched forth hys beldame. Than they all thre in-same Kneled there in-fere And helde up theyr hands on hy(ght) And thanked god wyth all theyr mygh(t) That he had them so dyght And mended theyr chere. Our lorde sayd to the smyth tho: âLoke, thou brenne never mo! For this craft, I shal tel the, Can thou never lere. But here a poynt I gyve the: The mayster shalt thou yet be Of all thy craft truely Wythout any delay; What man of craft soever be, And he have no helpe of the, Thoughe he be never so sle, Warke not he mayâ. Than our lorde forth went And bad the smyth take good tent That he no mo folke brent, By nyght nor yet by day. Our lorde thus forth gan go And left them togyther so, And dyd many a mervayle mo In dyvers countreis. He made many a croked ryght And gave blynd men agayne theyr syght, Dead men throughe hys myght He raysed full sone agayne, Leprous made he clere, Defe men for to here, And other sycknesses in-fere He heled them certayne: All sycke men that to hym sought And to hym that were brought, And loved lely in theyr thought, And were losed of theyr payne. Pray we all to hym thys That suche a lord is: That he brynge us to blys That never shall mys. Amen. Thus endeth the game How the smyth brent hys dame And after made her agayne By our blessed lord.
