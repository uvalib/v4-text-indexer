      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. (THE ESSAYES OF A PRENTISE AND POETICALL EXERCISES AT VACANT HOURES) THE ESSAYES OF A PRENTISE, IN THE DIVINE ART OF POESIE. SONNET. [If Martiall deeds, and practise of the pen] If Martiall deeds, and practise of the pen Haue wonne to auncient Grece a worthie fame: If Battels bold, and Bookes of learned men Haue magnified the mightie Romain name: Then place this Prince, who well deserues the same: Since he is one of Mars and Pallas race: For both the Godds in him haue sett in frame Their vertewes both, which both, he doth embrace. O Macedon, adornde with heauenly grace, O Romain stout, decorde with learned skill, The Monarks all to thee shall quite their place: Thy endles fame shall all the world fulfill. And after thee, none worthier shalbe seene, To sway the Svvord, and gaine the Laurell greene. T. H. SONNET. [The glorious Grekis in stately style do blaise] The glorious Grekis in stately style do blaise The lawde, the conqurour gaue their Homer olde: The verses Cæsar song in Maroes praise, The Romanis in remembrance depe haue rolde. Ye Thespian Nymphes, that suppe the Nectar colde, That from Parnassis forked topp doth fall, What Alexander or Augustus bolde, May sound his fame, whose vertewes passe them all? O Phœbus, for thy help, heir might I call, And on Minerue, and Maias learned sonne: But since I know, none was, none is, nor shall, Can rightly ring the fame that he hath wonne, Then stay your trauels, lay your pennis adowne, For Cæsars works, shall iustly Cæsar crowne. R. H. SONNET. [The mightie Father of the Muses nyne] The mightie Father of the Muses nyne Who mounted thame vpon Parnassus hill, Where Phœbus faire amidd these Sisters fyne With learned toung satt teaching euer still, Of late yon God declared his woundrous will, That Vranie should teach this Prince most rare: Syne she informed her scholler with such skill, None could with him in Poesie compaire. Lo, heir the fructis, Nymphe, of thy foster faire, Lo heir (ô noble Ioue) thy will is done, Her charge compleit, as deid doth now declaire. This work will witnesse, she obeyed the sone. O Phœbus then reioyce with glauncing glore, Since that a King doth all thy court decore. M. VV. SONNET. [When as my minde exemed was from caire] When as my minde exemed was from caire, Among the Nymphis my self I did repose: Where I gaue eare to one, who did prepaire Her sugred voice this sequell to disclose. Conveine your selfs (ô sisters) doe not lose This passing tyme which hasteth fast away: And yow who wrytes in stately verse and prose, This glorious Kings immortall gloire display. Tell how he doeth in tender yearis essay Aboue his age with skill our arts to blaise. Tell how he doeth with gratitude repay The crowne he wan for his deserued praise. Tell how of Ioue, of Mars, but more of God The gloire and grace he hath proclaimed abrod. M. W. F. SONNET. [Can goldin Titan shyning bright at morne] Can goldin Titan shyning bright at morne For light of Torchis, cast ane greater shaw? Can Thunder reard the heicher for a horne? Craks Cannons louder, thoght ane Cok sould craw? Can our weak breath help Boreas for to blaw? Can Candill lowe giue fyre a greater heit? Can quhytest Svvans more quhyter mak the Snavv? Can Virgins tears augment the Vinters weit? Helps pyping Pan Apollos Musique sweit? Can Fountanis small the Ocean sea incresse? No, they augment the greater nocht a quheit: Bot they them selues appears to grow the lesse. So (worthy Prince) thy works sall mak the knawin. Ours helps not thyne: we steynzie bot our awin. A. M. ANE QVADRAIN OF ALEXANDRIN VERSE. Immortall Gods, sen I with pen and Poets airt So willingly hes servde you, though my skill be small, I pray then euerie one of you to help his pairt, In graunting this my sute, which after follow shall. SONNET. 1. [First Ioue, as greatest God aboue the rest] First Ioue, as greatest God aboue the rest, Graunt thou to me a pairt of my desyre: That when in verse of thee I wryte my best, This onely thing I earnestly requyre, That thou my veine Poetique so inspyre, As they may suirlie think, all that it reid, When I descryue thy might and thundring fyre, That they do see thy self in verie deid From heauen thy greatest Thunders for to leid, And syne vpon the Gyants heads to fall: Or cumming to thy Semele with speid In Thunders least, at her request and call: Or throwing Phæthon downe from heauen to eard, With threatning thunders, making monstrous reard. SONNET. 2. [Apollo nixt, assist me in a parte] Apollo nixt, assist me in a parte, Sen vnto Ioue thou secound art in might, That when I do descryue thy shyning Carte, The Readers may esteme it in their sight. And graunt me als, thou worlds ô onely light, That when I lyke for subiect to deuyse To wryte, how as before thy countenaunce bright The yeares do stand, with seasons dowble twyse, That so I may descryue the verie guyse Thus by thy help, of yeares wherein we liue: As Readers syne may say, heir surely lyes, Of seasons fowre, the glasse and picture viue. Grant als, that so I may my verses warpe, As thou may play them syne vpon thy Harpe. SONNET. 3. [And first, ô Phœbus, when I do descriue] And first, ô Phœbus, when I do descriue The Springtyme sproutar of the herbes and flowris, Whomewith in rank none of the foure do striue, But nearest thee do stande all tymes and howris: Graunt Readers may esteme, they sie the showris, Whose balmie dropps so softlie dois distell, Which watrie cloudds in mesure suche downe powris, As makis the herbis, and verie earth to smell With sauours sweit, fra tyme that onis thy sell The vapouris softlie sowkis with smyling cheare, VVhilks syne in cloudds are keiped closs and well, VVhill vehement Winter come in tyme of yeare. Graunt, when I lyke the Springtyme to displaye, That Readers think they sie the Spring alwaye. SONNET. 4. [And graunt I may so viuely put in verse] And graunt I may so viuely put in verse The Sommer, when I lyke theirof to treat: As when in writ I do theirof reherse, Let Readers think they fele the burning heat, And graithly see the earth, for lacke of weit, With withering drouth and Sunne so gaigged all, As for the grasse on feild, the dust in streit Doth ryse and flee aloft, long or it fall. Yea, let them think, they heare the song and call, Which Floras wingde musicians maks to sound. And that to taste, and smell, beleue they shall Delicious fruictis, whilks in that tyme abound. And shortly, all their senses so bereaued, As eyes and earis, and all may be deceaued. SONNET. 5. [Or when I lyke my pen for to imploy] Or when I lyke my pen for to imploy Of fertile Harvest in the description trew: Let Readers think, they instantly conuoy The busie shearers for to reap their dew, By cutting rypest cornes with hookes anew: Which cornes their heauy heads did dounward bow, Els seking earth againe, from whence they grew, And vnto Ceres do their seruice vow. Let Readers also surely think and trow, They see the painfull Vigneron pull the grapes: First tramping them, and after pressing now The grenest clusters gathered into heapes. Let then the Harvest so viue to them appeare, As if they saw both cornes and clusters neare. SONNET. 6. [Bvt let them think, in verie deid they feill] Bvt let them think, in verie deid they feill, When as I do the VVinters stormes vnfolde, The bitter frosts, which waters dois congeill In VVinter season, by a pearcing colde. And that they heare the whiddering Boreas bolde, With hiddeous hurling, rolling Rocks from hie. Or let them think, they see god Saturne olde, Whose hoarie haire owercouering earth, maks flie The lytle birds in flocks, fra tyme they see The earth and all with stormes of snow owercled: Yea let them think, they heare the birds that die, Make piteous mone, that Saturnes hairis are spred. Apollo, graunt thir foirsaid suitis of myne, All fyue I say, that thou may crowne me syne. SONNET. 7. [And when I do descriue the Oceans force] And when I do descriue the Oceans force, Graunt syne, ô Neptune, god of seas profound, That readars think on leeboard, and on dworce, And how the Seas owerflowed this massiue round: Yea, let them think, they heare a stormy sound, Which threatnis wind, and darknes come at hand: And water in their shipps syne to abound, By weltring waues, like hyest towres on land. Then let them thinke their shipp now low on sand, Now climmes &amp; skippes to top of rageing seas, Now downe to hell, when shippmen may not stand, But lifts their hands to pray thee for some eas. Syne let them think thy Trident doth it calme, Which maks it cleare and smothe lyke glas or alme. SONNET. 8. [And graunt the lyke when as the swimming sort] And graunt the lyke when as the swimming sort Of all thy subjects skaled I list declare: As Triton monster with a manly port, Who drownd the Troyan trumpetour most raire: As Marmaids wyse, who wepis in wether faire: And marvelous Monkis, I meane Monkis of the see. Bot what of monsters, when I looke and staire On wounderous heapes of subiectis seruing the? As whailes so huge, and Sea eylis rare, that be Myle longs, in crawling cruikis of sixtie pace: And Daulphins, Seahorse, Selchs with oxin ee, And Mersvvynis, Pertrikis als of fishes race. In short, no fowle doth flie, nor beast doth go, But thow hast fishes lyke to them and mo. SONNET. 9. [O dreidfull Pluto, brother thrid to Ioue] O dreidfull Pluto, brother thrid to Ioue, With Proserpin, thy wife, the quene of hell: My sute to yow is, when I like to loaue The ioyes that do in Elise field excell: Or when I like great Tragedies to tell: Or flyte, or murne my fate: or wryte with feare The plagues ye do send furth with Diræ fell. Let Readers think, that both they see and heare Alecto, threatning Turnus sister deare: And heare Celænos wings, with Harpyes all: And see dog Cerberus rage with hiddeous beare, And all that did AEneas once befall. When as he past throw all those dongeons dim, The foresaid feilds syne visited by him. SONNET. 10. [O furious Mars, thow warlyke souldiour bold] O furious Mars, thow warlyke souldiour bold, And hardy Pallas, goddess stout and graue: Let Reidars think, when combats manyfold I do descriue, they see two champions braue, With armies huge approching to resaue Thy will, with cloudds of dust into the air. Syne Phifers, Drummes, and Trumpets cleir do craue The pelmell chok with larum loude alwhair, Then nothing hard but gunnis, and ratling fair Of speares, and clincking swords with glaunce so cleir, As if they foght in skyes, then wrangles thair Men killd, vnkilld, whill Parcas breath reteir. There lyes the venquisht wailing sore his chaunce: Here lyes the victor, rewing els the daunce. SONNET. 11. [And at your handis I earnestly do craue] And at your handis I earnestly do craue, O facound Mercure, with the Muses nyne, That for conducting guyde I may you haue, Aswell vnto my pen, as my Ingyne. Let Readers think, thy eloquence deuyne O Mercure, in my Poems doth appeare: And that Parnassis flowing fountaine fyne Into my works doth shyne lyke cristall cleare. O Muses, let them thinke that they do heare Your voyces all into my verse resound. And that your vertewis singuler and seir May wholly all in them be also found. Of all that may the perfyte Poems make, I pray you let my verses haue no lake. SONNET. 12. [In short, you all forenamed gods I pray] In short, you all forenamed gods I pray For to concur with one accord and will, That all my works may perfyte be alway: Which if ye doe, then sweare I for to fill My works immortall with your praises still: I shall your names eternall euer sing, I shall tread downe the grasse on Parnass hill By making with your names the world to ring: I shall your names from all obliuion bring. I lofty Virgill shall to life restoir, My subiects all shalbe of heauenly thing, How to delate the gods immortals gloir. Essay me once, and if ye find me swerue, Then thinke, I do not graces such deserue. FINIS. THE VRANIE translated THE VRANIE, OR HEAVENLY MVSE. Scarce was I yet in springtyme of my years, When greening great for fame aboue my pears Did make me lose my wonted chere and rest, Essaying learned works with curious brest. But as the Pilgrim, who for lack of light, Cumd on the parting of two wayes at night, He stayes assone, and in his mynde doeth cast, What way to take while Moonlight yet doth last. So I amongst the paths vpon that hill, Where Phœbus crownes all verses euer still Of endles praise, with Laurers always grene, Did stay confusde, in doubt which way to mene. I whyles essaide the Grece in Frenche to praise Whyles in that toung I gaue a lusty glaise For to descryue the Troian Kings of olde, And them that Thebes and Mycens crowns did holde. And whiles I had the storye of Fraunce elected, Which to the Muses I should haue directed: My holy furie with consent of nane. Made frenche the Mein, and nowyse dutche the Sein. Whiles thought I to set foorth with flattring pen: The praise vntrewe of Kings and noble men, And that I might both golde and honours haue With courage basse I made my Muse a slaue. And whyles I thought to sing the fickle boy Of Cypris soft, and loues to-swete anoy, To lofty sprits that are therewith made blynd, To which discours my nature and age inclynd. But whill I was in doubt what way to go, With wind ambitious tossed to and fro: A holy beuty did to mee appeare, The Thundrers daughter seeming as she weare. Her porte was Angellike with Angels face, With comely shape and toung of heauenly grace: Her nynevoced mouth resembled into sound The daunce harmonious making heauen resound. Her head was honorde with a costly crown, Seuinfolde and rounde, to dyuers motions boun: On euery folde I know not what doth glance, Aboue our heads into a circuler dance. The first it is of Lead, of Tin the nixt, The seuin Planets The third of Stele, the fourth of Golde vnmixt, The fyfth is made of pale Electre light, The sixt of Mercure, seuint of Siluer bright. Her corps is couured with an Asure gowne, Firmament Where thousand fires ar sowne both vp and downe: Fixed Starres. Whilks with an arte, but arte, confusde in order, Dois with their beames decore thereof the border. Heir shynes the Charlewain, there the Harp giues light, And heir the Seamans starres, and there Twinnis bright, And heir the Ballance, there the Fishes twaine, With thousand other fyres, that pas my braine. I am said she, that learned VRANIE, That to the Starres transports humanitie, And maks men see and twiche with hands and ene It that the heauenly court contempling bene. I quint-essence the Poets soule so well While he in high discours excede him sell, Who by the eare the deafest doeth allure, Reuiues the rocks, and stayes the floods for sure. The tone is pleasant of my Nyne Muses.sisters deir: Yet though their throts make heauen and earth admire, They yeld to me no lesse in singing well, Then Pye to Syraine, goose to Nightingell. Take me for guyde, lyft vp to heauen thy wing O Salust, Gods immortals honour sing: And bending higher Dauids Lute in tone, With courage seke yon endles crowne abone. I no wais can, vnwet my cheekes, beholde My sisters made by Frenchemen macquerels olde, Whose mignarde writts, but faynd lamenting vaine, And fayned teares and shameles tales retaine. But weping neither can I see them spyte Our heauenly verse, when they do nothing wryte, But Princes flattry that ar tyrants rather Then Nero, Commode, or Caligule ather. But specially but sobbes I neuer shall Se verse bestowde gainst him made verses all, I can not see his proper soldiers ding With his owne armes him that of all is King. Mans eyes are blinded with Cimmerien night: And haue he any good, beit neuer so light, From heauen, by mediat moyens, he it reaches, Bot only God the Delphiens songs vs teaches. All art is learned by art, this art alone It is a heauenly gift: no flesh nor bone Can preif the honnie we from Pinde distill, Except with holy fyre his breest we fill. From that spring flowes, that men of special chose, Consumde in learning, and perfyte in prose, For to take verse in vane dois trauell take, When as a prentise fairer works will make. That made that Homer, who a songster bene, Albeit a begger, lacking master, and ene, Exceded in his verse both new and olde, In singing Vliss and Achilles bolde. That made that Naso noght could speak but verse, That Dauid made my songs so sone reherse, Of pastor Poët made. yea yongmen whyles Vnknowing our art, yet by our art compyles. Seke night and day Castalias waltring waas, Climme day and night the twinrocks of Parnaas: Be Homers skoller, and his, was borne in Ande, The happie dwelling place of all our bande. How oft thou lykes reid ouer booke efter booke, The bookes of Troy, and of that towne which tooke Her name from Alexander Monark then, Exerce but cease thy toung and eke thy pen. Yea, if to make good verse thou hes sic cure, Joyne night to day, and day to night obscure, Yet shall thou not the worthy frute reape so Of all thy paines, if Pallas be thy fo. For man from man must wholly parted be. If with his age, his verse do well agree. Amongst our hands, he must his witts resing, A holy trance to highest heauen him bring. For euen as humane fury maks the man, Les then the man: So heauenly fury can Make man pas man, and wander in a holy mist, Vpon the fyrie heauen to walk at list. Within that place the heauenly Poëts sought Their learning, syne to vs heare downe it brought, With verse that ought to Atropos no dewe, Dame Naturs trunchmen, heauens interprets trewe. For Poets right are lyke the pype alway, Who full doth sound, and empty stayes to play: Euen so their fury lasting, lasts their tone, Their fury ceast, their Muse doth stay assone. Sen verse did then in heauen first bud and blume, If ye be heauenly, how dar ye presume A verse prophane, and mocking for to sing Gainst him that leads of starrie heauens the ring? Will ye then so ingrately make your pen, A slaue to sinne, and serue but fleshly men? Shall still your brains be busied then to fill With dreames, ô dreamers, euery booke and bill? Shall Satan still be God for your behoue? Still will ye riue the aire with cryes of loue? And shall there neuer into your works appeare The praise of God, resounding loud and cleare? Suffisis it noght ye feele into your hairt The Ciprian torche, vnles more malapairt Then Lais commoun quean, ye blow abrod But shame, athort the world, your shameles god? Abusers, staikes it not to lurk in lust, Without ye smit with charming nombers iust The fickle maners of the reader slight, In making him embrace, for day, the night? The harmony of nomber tone and song, That makes the verse so fair, it is so strong Ouer vs, as hardest Catos it will moue, With spreits aflought, and sweete transported loue. For as into the wax the seals imprent Is lyke a seale; right so the Poët gent, Doeth graue so viue in vs his passions strange, As maks the reader, halfe in author change. For verses force is sic, that softly slydes Throw secret poris, and in our sences bydes, As makes them haue both good and euill imprented, Which by the learned works is represented. And therefore Platos common wealth did pack None of these Poëts, who by verse did make The goodmen euill, and the wicked worse, Whose pleasaunt words betraied the publick corse. Not those that in their songs good tearmes alwaise Joyned with fair Thems: whyles thundring out the praise Of God, iust Thundrer: whyles with holy speache, Lyke Hermes did the way to strayers teache. Your shameles rymes, are cause, ô Scrybes prophane, That in the lyke opinion we remaine With Juglers, buffons, and that foolish seames: Yea les then them, the people of vs esteames. For Clio ye put Thais vyle in vre, For Helicon a bordell. Ye procure By your lascivious speache, that fathers sage Defends verse reading, to their yonger age. But lightleing yon fleing godhead slight, Who in Idolatrous breasts his darts hath pight. If that ye would imploy your holy traunce, To make a holy hallowde worke in Fraunce: Then euery one wolde worthy scribes you call, And holy seruants to the King of all. Echone your verse for oracles wolde take, And great men of their counsell wolde you make. The verses knitting was found out and tryit, For singing only holy mysteries by it With greater grace. And efter that, were pend Longtyme no verse, but for that only end. Euen so my Dauid on the trembling strings Of heauenly harps, Gods only praise he sings. Euen so the leader of the Hebrevv hoste, Gods praise did sing vpon the Redsea coste. So Judith and Delbor in the soldiers throngs, So Job and Jeremie, preast with woes and wrongs, Did right descryue their ioyes, their woes and torts, In variant verse of hundreth thousand sorts. And therefore crafty Sathan, who can seame An Angell of light, to witch vs in our dreame, He causde his gods and preests of olde to speake By nomber and measure, which they durst not breake. So fond Phœmonoë vnder Apollos wing, Her oracles Hexameter did sing: With doubtsum talk she craftely begylde, Not only Grece, but Spaine and Indes she sylde. That olde voce serude in Dodon, spak in verse As AEsculap did, and so did Ammon fearse, So Sybills tolde in verse, what was to come: The Preests did pray by nombers, all and some. So Hesiod, Line, and he Orpheus. whose Lute they say, Made rocks and forrests come to hear him play, Durst well their heauenly secrets all discloes, In learned verse, that softly slydes and goes. O ye that wolde your browes with Laurel bind, What larger feild I pray you can you find, Then is his praise, who brydles heauens most cleare, Maks mountaines tremble, and howest hells to feare? That is a horne of plenty well repleat: That is a storehouse riche, a learning seat. An Ocean hudge, both lacking shore and ground, Of heauenly eloquence a spring profound. From subiects base, a base discours dois spring, A lofty subiect of it selfe doeth bring Graue words and weghtie, of it selfe diuine, And makes the authors holy honour shine. If ye wolde after ashes liue, bewaire, To do lyke Erostrat, who brunt the faire Ephesian temple, or him, to win a name, PerillusWho built of brasse, the crewell Calfe vntame. Let not your art so rare then be defylde, In singing Venus, and her fethred chylde: For better it is without renowme to be, Then be renowmde for vyle iniquitie. Those nyne are Maides, that daunce vpon Parnaas: Learned Pallas is a Virgin pure, lyke as DaphneThat fair, whom waters changed on wattry banks Into Laurell that tre still grene, your hair that hanks. Then consecrat that eloquence most rair, To sing the lofty miracles and fair Of holy Scripture: and of your good ingyne, Pour out, my frends, there your fift-essence fyne. Let Christ both God and man your Twinrock be, Whome on ye slepe: for that hors Pegasus. who did fle, Speak of that Holy ghost.thryse great spreit, whose dow most white Mote make your spring flow euer with delyte. All excellent worke beare record euer shall, Of trauellers in it, though their paines be small. The Mausole tombe the names did eternise Of Scope, Timotheus, Briace, and Artemise. But Hirams holy help it war vnknowne What he in building Izraels Temple had showne, Without Gods Ark Beseleel Iewe had bene In euerlasting silence buried clene. Then, since the bewty of those works most rare Hath after death made liue all them that ware Their builders; though them selues with tyme be failde, By spoils, by fyres, by warres, and tempests quailde. I pray you think, how mekle fairer shall Your happie name heirdowne be, when as all Your holy verse, great God alone shall sing. Since praise immortall commes of endles thing. I know that ye will say, the auncient rables Decores your songs, and that Metamorphosis.those dyuers fables, Ilk bred of other, doeth your verses mak More loued then storyes by the vulgar pack. But where can there more wondrous things be found, Then those of faith? ô fooles, what other ground, With witnes mo, our reasons quyte improues, Beats doun our pryde, that curious questions moues? I had farr rather Babell tower forthsett, Then the Ossa, Pindus, and Olympusthre Grecian hilles on others plett To pull doun gods afraide, and in my moode, Sing Noës rather then Deucalions floode. I had far rather sing the suddaine change Of Assurs monark, then of Arcas strange. Of the Nabuchadnezer. Bethaniens holy second liuing, Then Hippolitts with members glewde reuiuing. To please the Reader is the ones whole cair, The vther for to proffite mair and mair: But only he of Laurell is conding, Who wysely can with proffit, pleasure ming. The fairest walking on the Sea coast bene, And suirest swimming where the braes are grene: So, wyse is he, who in his verse can haue Skill mixt with pleasure, sports with doctrine graue. In singing kepe this order showen you heir, Then ye your self, in teaching men shall leir The rule of liuing well, and happely shall Your songs make, as your thems immortall all. No more into those oweryere lyes delyte, My freinds, cast of that insolent archer quyte, Who only may the ydle harts surpryse: Prophane no more the Muses with yon cryes. But oh! in vaine, with crying am I horce: For lo, where one, noght caring my songs force, Goes lyke a crafty snaik, and stoppes his eare: The other godles, mocks and will not heare. Ane other at my schoole abydes a space, While charming world withdrawe him from that place: So that discours, that maks good men reiose, At one eare enters, and at the other goes. Alas, I se not one vnvaill his ene From Venus vaill and gal prophane, that bene To golden honnied verse, the only harme Although our France with lofty sprits doth swarme. But thou my deir one, whome the holy Nyne, Who yearly drinks Pegasis fountaine fyne, The great gods holy songster had receiued, Yea, euen before thy mother the conceiued. Albeit this subiect seame a barren ground, With quickest spreits left ley, as they it found, Irk not for that heirefter of thy paine, Thy glore by rairnes greater shall remaine. O Salust, lose not heart, though pale Inuye Bark at thy praise increasing to the skye, Feare not that she tread vnder foote thy verse As if they were vnworthie to reherse. This monster honnors-hurt is lyke the curr, That barks at strangers comming to the durr, But sparing alwaies those are to him knowin, To them most gentle, to the others throwin. This monster als is like a rauing cloude, Which threatnes alwayis kendling Vulcan loude. To smore and drowne him with her powring raine, Yet force of fyre repellis her power againe. Then follow furth, my sonne, that way vnfeard, Of them whom in fre heauens gift hath appeard. And heare I sweare, thou shortly shall resaue Some noble rank among good spreits and graue. This heauenly Muse by such discourses fair, Who in her Virgin hand a riche crowne bair: So drew to her my heart, so farr transported, And with swete grace so swetely she exhorted: As since that loue into my braines did brew, And since that only wind my shipsailles blew, I thought me blest, if I might only clame To touche that crown, though not to weare the same.

PHOENIX. The dyuers falls, that Fortune geuis to men, By turning ouer her quheill to their annoy, When I do heare them grudge, although they ken That olde blinde Dame delytes to let the ioy Of all, suche is her vse, which dois conuoy Her quheill by gess: not looking to the right, Bot still turnis vp that pairt quhilk is too light. Thus quhen I hard so many did complaine, Some for the losse of worldly wealth and geir, Some death of frends, quho can not come againe; Some losse of health, which vnto all is deir, Some losse of fame, which still with it dois beir Ane greif to them, who mereits it indeid: Yet for all thir appearis there some remeid. For as to geir, lyke chance as made you want it, Restore you may the same againe or mair. For death of frends, althought the same (I grant it) Can noght returne, yet men are not so rair, Bot ye may get the lyke. For seiknes sair Your health may come: or to ane better place Ye must. For fame, good deids will mend disgrace. Then, fra I saw (as I already told) How men complaind for things whilk might amend, How Dauid Lyndsay did complaine of old His Papingo, her death and sudden end, Ane common foule, whose kinde be all is kend. All these hes moved me presently to tell Ane Tragedie, in greifs thir to excell. For I complaine not of sic common cace, Which diuersly by diuers means dois fall: But I lament my Phœnix rare, whose race, Whose kynde, whose kin, whose offspring, they be all In her alone, whome I the Phœnix call. That fowle which only one at onis did liue, Not liues, alas! though I her praise reviue. In Arabie cald Fœlix was she bredd This foule, excelling Iris farr in hew. Whose body whole, with purpour was owercledd, Whose taill of coulour was celestiall blew, With skarlat pennis that through it mixed grew: Her craig was like the yallowe burnisht gold, And she herself thre hundreth yeare was old. She might haue liued as long againe and mair, If fortune had not stayde dame Naturs will: Six hundreth yeares and fourtie was her scair, Which Nature ordained her for to fulfill. Her natiue soile she hanted euer still, Except to Egypt whiles she tooke her course, Wherethrough great Nylus downe runs from his sourse. Like as ane hors, when he is barded haile, An fethered pannach set vpon his heid, Will make him seame more braue: Or to assaile The enemie, he that the troups dois leid, Ane pannache on his healme will set in deid: Euen so, had Nature, to decore her face Giuen her ane tap, for to augment her grace. In quantitie, she dois resemble neare, Vnto the foule of mightie Jove, by name The AEgle calld: oft in the time of yeare, She vsde to soir, and flie through diuers realme, Out through the Azure skyes, whill she did shame The Sunne himself, her coulour was so bright, Till he abashit beholding such a light. Thus whill she vsde to scum the skyes about, At last she chanced to sore out ower the see Calld Mare Rubrum: yet her course held out Whill that she past whole Asie. Syne to flie To Europe small she did resolue: To drie Her voyage out, at last she came in end Into this land, ane stranger heir vnkend. Ilk man did maruell at her forme most rare. The winter came, and storms cled all the feild: Which storms, the land of fruit and corne made bare, Then did she flie into an house for beild, VVhich from the storms might saue her as an sheild. There, in that house she first began to tame, I came, syne tooke her furth out of the same. Fra her I gat, yet none could gess what sort Of foule she was, nor from what countrey cum: Nor I my self: except that be her port, And glistering hewes I knew that she was sum Rare stranger foule, which oft had vsde to scum Through diuers lands, delyting in her flight; Which made vs see, so strange and rare a sight. Whill at the last, I chanced to call to minde How that her nature, did resemble neir To that of Phœnix which I red. Her kinde, Her hewe, her shape, did mak it plaine appeir, She was the same, which now was lighted heir. This made me to esteme of her the more, Her name and rarenes did her so decore. Thus being tamed, and throughly weill acquent. She toke delyte (as she was wount before) What tyme that Titan with his beames vpsprent, To take her flight, amongs the skyes to soire. Then came to her of fowlis, a woundrous store Of diuers kinds, some simple fowlis, some ill And rauening fowlis, whilks simple onis did kill. And euen as they do swarme about their king The hunnie Bees, that works into the hyue: VVhen he delyts furth of the skepps to spring, Then all the leaue will follow him belyue, Syne to be nixt him bisselie they striue: So, all thir fowlis did follow her with beir, For loue of her, fowlis rauening did no deir. Such was the loue, and reuerence they her bure, Ilk day whill euen, ay whill they shedd at night. Fra time it darkned, I was euer sure Of her returne, remaining whill the light, And Phœbus rysing with his garland bright. Such was her trueth, fra time that she was tame, She, who in brightnes Titans self did shame. By vse of this, and hanting it, at last She made the foules, fra time that I went out, Aboue my head to flie, and follow fast Her, who was chief and leader of the rout. When it grew lait, she made them flie, but doubt, Or feare, euen in the closse with her of will, Syne she her self, perkt in my chalmer still. When as the countreys round about did heare Of this her byding in this countrey cold, Which not but hills, and darknes ay dois beare, (And for this cause was Scotia calld of old,) Her lyking here, when it was to them told, And how she greind not to go backe againe: The loue they bure her, turnd into disdaine. Lo, here the fruicts, whilks of Inuy dois breid, To harme them all, who vertue dois imbrace. Lo, here the fruicts, from her whilks dois proceid, To harme them all, that be in better cace Then others be. So followed they the trace Of proud Inuy, thir countreyis lying neir, That such a foule, should lyke to tary heir. Whill Fortoun at the last, not onely moued Inuy to this, which could her not content, Whill that Inuy, did sease some foules that loued Her anis as semed: but yet their ill intent Kythed, when they saw all other foules still bent To follow her, misknowing them at all. This made them worke her vndeserued fall. Thir were the rauening fowls, whome of I spak Before, the whilks (as I already shew) Was wount into her presence to hald bak Their crueltie, from simple ones, that flew With her, ay whill Inuy all feare withdrew. Thir ware, the Rauin, the Stainchell, &amp; the Gled, With other kynds, whome in this malice bred. Fra Malice thus was rooted be Inuy, In them as sone the awin effects did shaw. VVhich made them syne, vpon ane day, to spy And wait till that, as she was wount, she flaw Athort the skyes, syne did they neir her draw, Among the other fowlis of dyuers kynds, Although they were farr dissonant in mynds. For where as they ware wount her to obey, Their mynde farr contrair then did plaine appeare. For then they made her as a commoun prey To them, of whome she looked for no deare, They strake at her so bitterly, whill feare Stayde other fowlis to preis for to defend her From thir ingrate, whilks now had clene miskend her. When she could find none other saue refuge From these their bitter straiks, she fled at last To me (as if she wolde wishe me to iudge The wrong they did her) yet they followed fast Till she betuix my leggs her selfe did cast. For sauing her from these, which her opprest, Whose hote pursute, her suffred not to rest. Bot yet at all that servd not for remeid, For noghttheles, they spaird her not a haire. In stede of her, yea whyles they made to bleid My leggs: (so grew their malice mair and mair) Which made her both to rage and to dispair, First, that but cause they did her such dishort: Nixt, that she laked help in any sort. Then hauing tane ane dry and wethered stra, In deip dispair, and in ane lofty rage She sprang vp heigh, outfleing euery fa: Syne to Panchaia came, to change her age Vpon Apollos altar, to asswage With outward fyre her inward raging fyre: Which then was all her cheif and whole desyre. Then being carefull, the event to know Of her, who homeward had returnde againe Where she was bred, where storms dois neuer blow, Nor bitter blasts, nor winter snows, nor raine, Bot sommer still: that countray doeth so staine All realmes in fairnes. There in haste I sent, Of her to know the yssew and event. The messinger went there into sic haste, As could permit the farrnes of the way, By crossing ower sa mony countreys waste Or he come there. Syne with a lytle stay Into that land, drew homeward euery day: In his returne, lyke diligence he shew As in his going there, through realmes anew. Fra he returnd, then sone without delay I speared at him, (the certeantie to try) What word of Phœnix which was flowen away? And if through all the lands he could her spy, Where through he went, I bad him not deny, But tell the trueth, yea whither good or ill Was come of her, to wit it was my will. He tolde me then, how she flew bak againe, Where fra she came and als he did receit, How in Panchaia toun, she did remaine On Phœbus altar, there for to compleit With Thus and Myrrh, and other odours sweit Of flowers of dyuers kyndes, and of Incens Her nest With that he left me in suspens. Till that I charged him no wayes for to spair, But presently to tell me out the rest. He tauld me then, How Titans garland thair Inflamde be heate, reflexing on her nest, The withered stra, which when she was opprest Heir be yon fowlis, she bure ay whill she came There, syne aboue her nest she laid the same. And syne he tolde, how she had such desyre To burne herself, as she sat downe therein. Syne how the Sunne the withered stra did fyre, Which brunt her nest, her fethers, bones and skin All turnd in ash. Whose end dois now begin My woes: her death makes lyfe to greif in me. She, whome I rew my eyes did euer see. O deuills of darknes, contraire vnto light, In Phœbus fowle, how could ye get such place, Since ye are hated ay be Phœbus bright? For still is sene his light dois darknes chace. But yet ye went into that fowle, whose grace, As Phœbus fowle, yet ward the Sunne him sell. Her light his staind, whome in all light dois dwell. And thou (ô Phœnix) why was thow so moued Thou foule of light, be enemies to thee, For to forget thy heauenly hewes, whilkis loued Were baith by men and fowlis that did them see? And syne in hewe of ashe that they sould bee Conuerted all: and that thy goodly shape In Chaos sould, and noght the fyre escape? And thow (ô reuthles Death) sould thow deuore Her? who not only passed by all mens mynde All other fowlis in hewe, and shape, but more In rarenes (sen there was none of her kynde But she alone) whome with thy stounds thow pynde: And at the last, hath perced her through the hart, But reuth or pitie, with thy mortall dart. Yet worst of all, she liued not half her age. Why stayde thou Tyme at least, which all dois teare To worke with her? O what a cruell rage, To cut her off, before her threid did weare! VVherein all Planets keeps their course, that yeare It was not by the half yet worne away, VVhich sould with her haue ended on a day. Then fra thir newis, in sorrows soped haill, Had made vs both a while to holde our peace, Then he began and said, Pairt of my taill Is yet vntolde, Lo here one of her race, Ane worme bred of her ashe: Though she, alace, (Said he) be brunt, this lacks but plumes and breath To be lyke her, new gendred by her death. L'envoy. Apollo then, who brunt with thy reflex Thine onely fowle, through loue that thou her bure, Although thy fowle, (whose name doeth end in X) Thy burning heat on nowayes could indure, But brunt thereby: Yet will I the procure, Late foe to Phœnix, now her freind to be: Reuiuing her by that which made her die. Draw farr from heir, mount heigh vp through the air, To gar thy heat and beames be law and neir. That in this countrey, which is colde and bair, Thy glistring beames als ardent may appeir As they were oft in Arabie: so heir Let them be now, to make ane Phœnix new Euen of this worme of Phœnix ashe which grew. This if thow dois, as sure I hope thou shall, My tragedie a comike end will haue: Thy work thou hath begun, to end it all. Els made ane worme, to make her out the laue. This Epitaphe, then beis on Phœnix graue. Here lyeth, vvhome too euen be her death and end Apollo hath a longer lyfe her send. FINIS. A PARAPHRASTICALL TRANSLATION OVT OF THE POETE LVCANE. LVCANVS LIB. QVINTO. Caesaris an cursus vestræ sentire putatis Damnum posse fugæ?

For out of him they are augmented all, And most part creat, as ye shall persaue: For when the Sunne doth souk the vapours small Forth of the seas, whilks them containe and haue, A parte in winde, in wete and raine the laue He render dois: which doth augment their strands. Of Neptuns woll a coate syne they him weaue, By hurling to him fast out ower the lands. When all is done, do to him what they can None can persaue that they do swell him mair. I put the case then that they neuer ran: Yet not theles that could him nowise pair: VVhat needs he then to count it, or to cair, Except their folies wold the more be shawin? Sen though they stay, it harmes him not a hair, What gain they, thogh they had their course withdrawen? So euen siclike: Though subiects do coniure For to rebell against their Prince and King: By leauing him although they hope to smure That grace, wherewith God maks him for to ring, Though by his gifts he shaw him selfe bening, To help their need, and make them thereby gaine: Yet lacke of them no harme to him doth bring, VVhen they to rewe their folie shalbe faine. L'enuoy. Then Floods runne on your wounted course of olde, Which God by Nature dewly hes prouyded: For though ye stay, as I before haue tolde, And cast in doubt which God hath els decyded: To be conioynde, by you to be deuyded: To kythe your spite, &amp; do the Depe no skaith: Farre better were in others ilk confyded, Ye Floods, thou Depe, whilks were your dewties baith.

O Lord inspyre my spreit and pen, to praise Thy Name, whose greatnes far surpassis all: That syne, I may thy gloir and honour blaise, Which cleithis the ouer: about the lyke a wall The light remainis. O thow, whose charge and call, Made Heauens lyke courtenis for to spred abreid, Who bowed the waters so, as serue they shall For cristall syilring ouer thy house to gleid. Who walks vpon the wings of restles winde, Who of the clouds his chariot made, euen he, Who in his presence still the spreits doeth find, Ay ready to fulfill ilk iust decrie Of his, whose seruants fyre and flammis they be. Who set the earth on her fundations sure, So as her brangling none shall euer see: Who at thy charge the deip vpon her bure. So, as the very tops of mountains hie Be fluidis were onis ouerflowed at thy command, Ay whill thy thundring voice sone made them flie Ower hiddeous hills and howes, till noght but sand Was left behind, syne with thy mightie hand Thow limits made vnto the roring deip. So shall she neuer droun againe the land, But brek her wawes on rockis, her mairch to keip. Thir are thy workis, who maid the strands to breid, Syne rinn among the hills from fountains cleir, Whairto wyld Asses oft dois rinn with speid, With vther beasts to drinke. Hard be we heir The chirping birds among the leaues, with beir To sing, whil all the rocks about rebounde. A woundrous worke, that thow, ô Father deir, Maks throtts so small yeild furth so great a sound! O thow who from thy palace oft letts fall (For to refresh the hills) thy blessed raine: Who with thy works mainteins the earth and all: Who maks to grow the herbs and grass to gaine. The herbs for foode to man, grass dois remaine For food to horse, and cattell of all kynde. Thow causest them not pull at it in vaine, But be thair foode: such is thy will and mynde. Who dois reioyse the hart of man with wyne, And who with oyle his face maks cleir and bright, And who with foode his stomack strengthnes syne Who nurishes the very treis aright. The Cedars evin of Liban tale and wight He planted hath, where birds do bigg their nest. He made the Firr treis of a woundrous hight, Where Storks dois mak thair dwelling place, &amp; rest. Thow made the barren hills, wylde goats refuge, Thow maid the rocks, a residence and rest For Alpin ratts, where they doe liue and ludge. Thow maid the Moone, her course, as thou thoght best. Thow maid the Sunne in tyme go to, that lest He still sould shyne, then night sould neuer come. But thow in ordour all things hes so drest, Some beasts for day, for night are also some. For Lyons young at night beginnis to raire, And from their denns to craue of God some pray: Then in the morning, gone is all their caire, And homeward to their caues rinnis fast, fra day Beginne to kythe, the Sunne dois so them fray. Then man gois furth, fra tyme the Sunne dois ryse, And whill the euening he remanis away At lesume labour, where his liuing lyes. How large and mightie are thy workis, ô Lord! And with what wisedome are they wrought, but faile. The earths great fulnes, of thy gifts recorde Dois beare: Heir of the Seas (which dyuers skaile Of fish contenis) dois witnes beare: Ilk saile Of dyuers ships vpon the swolling wawes Dois testifie, as dois the monstrous whaile, Who frayis all fishes with his ravening Jawes. All thir (ô Lord) yea all this woundrous heape Of liuing things, in season craues their fill Of foode from thee. Thow giuing, Lord, they reape: Thy open hand with gude things fills them still When so thow list: but contrar, when thow will Withdraw thy face, then are they troubled sair, Their breath by thee receavd, sone dois them kill: Syne they returne into their ashes bair. But notwithstanding, Father deare, in cace Thow breath on them againe, then they reviue. In short, thow dois, ô Lord, renewe the face Of all the earth, and all that in it liue. Therefore immortall praise to him we giue: Let him reioyse into his works he maid, Whose looke and touche, so hills and earth dois greiue, As earth dois tremble, mountainis reikis, afraid. To Jehoua I all my lyfe shall sing, To sound his Name I euer still shall cair: It shall be sweit my thinking on that King: In him I shall be glaid for euer mair: O let the wicked be into no whair In earth. O let the sinfull be destroyde. Blesse him my soule who name Iehoua bair: O blesse him now with notts that are enioyde. Hallelu-iah. ANE SCHORT POEME OF TYME. As I was pansing in a morning, aire, And could not sleip, nor nawayis take me rest, Furth for to walk, the morning was sa faire, Athort the feilds, it semed to me the best. The East was cleare, whereby belyue I gest That fyrie Titan cumming was in sight, Obscuring chast Diana by his light. Who by his rysing in the Azure skyes, Did dewlie helse all thame on earth do dwell. The balmie dew through birning drouth he dryis, VVhich made the soile to sauour sweit and smell, By dewe that on the night before downe fell, VVhich then was soukit vp by the Delphienns heit Vp in the aire: it was so light and weit. Whose hie ascending in his purpour Sphere Prouoked all from Morpheus to flee; As beasts to feid, and birds to sing with beir, Men to their labour, bissie as the Bee: Yet ydle men deuysing did I see, How for to dryue the tyme that did them irk, By sindrie pastymes, quhill that it grew mirk. Then woundred I to see them seik a wyle, So willinglie the precious tyme to tyne: And how they did them selfis so farr begyle, To fashe of tyme, which of it selfe is fyne. Fra tyme be past, to call it bakwart syne Is bot in vaine: therefore men sould be warr, To sleuth the tyme that flees fra them so farr. For what hath man bot tyme into this lyfe, Which giues him dayis his God aright to knaw: Wherefore then sould we be at sic a stryfe, So spedelie our selfis for to withdraw Euin from the tyme, which is on nowayes slaw To flie from vs, suppose we fled it noght? More wyse we were, if we the tyme had soght. Bot sen that tyme is sic a precious thing, I wald we sould bestow it into that Which were most pleasour to our heauenly King. Flee ydilteth, which is the greatest lat. Bot sen that death to all is destinat, Let vs imploy that tyme that God hath send vs, In doing weill, that good men may commend vs. Haec quoq; perficiat, quod perficit omnia, Tempus. FINIS.

Where others hooded with blind loue do flie, Low on the ground with buzzard CVPIDS wings, A heauenlie loue, from loue of loue thee brings, And makes thy MVSE to mount aboue the skie, Young Muses be not woont to flie too hie, Age taught by time, such sober ditties sings, But thy youth flies from loue of youthfull things, And so the wings of time doth ouerflie. Thus thou disdainst all worldlie wings as slow, Because thy MVSE with Angels wings doth leaue Times wings behind, and CVPIDS wings below, But take thou heed, least Fames wings thee deceaue. With all thy speed from Fame thou canst not flee, But more thou flees, the more it followes thee. HENRIE CONSTABLE. SONET TO THE ONELY ROYAL POET. Where shall the limits lye of all your fame? Where shall the borders be of your renowne? In East? or where the Sunne again goeth down? Or shall the fixed Poles impale the same? Where shall the pillars which your praise proclame Or Trophees stand, of that exspected crowne? The Monarch first, of that triumphant towne Reuiues in you, by you renewes his name, For that which he performd in battels bold, To vs his bookes with wonders doth vnfold. So we of you far more conceaue in minde, As by your verse we plainlie (Sir) may see. You shall the writer and the worker be, For to absolue that CÆSAR left behinde. M. W. FOVLER. Musa Cælo beat. TO THE KINGS MAIESTIE OF SCOTLAND. If ALEXANDER sighed vvhen he came, Vnto the Tomb vvhere fierce ACHILLES lay: If he had cause, that blessed age to blame, Since HOMER lacks his merites to display. If he vvith teares his sorrovves did bevvray, To see his Father PHILIP conquer all, And that more Worlds behinde there did not stay, Which for revvard of his deserts might fall: Then may I mone, our times, our iudgement small, Vnvvorthy records of your sacred skill; Then must our Poets on nevv Muses call, To graunt them guifts to imitate your quill. I like the flie, that burneth in the flame, Should shevv my blindnes to attempt the same. HENRIE LOK. THE EXORD, OR PREFACE OF THE SECOND VVEEK OF DV BARTAS.

O SACRED Floure-delis whose youth Doth promise to vs all, That euen thy famous Lawrels greene Match Alexanders shall, Since that (for to obey thy will,) I flie vnto the skies, Conuoy my course with louing eie, And help the faultes that rise From my too blunted frutelesse pen, In Pampeloun so some day, Mot thou win home thy crowne againe, The which was reft away: So of thy neighbours euermore Mot thou the honour be, The loue of all thy subiects true, And foes to feare for thee: So neuer mot the heauen against Thee shew his wrathfull face, But the Eternall be thy arme, His Spirit thy guiding trace: So with thy shearing sword in hand And fighting at thy side, Mot I ore cled with blood and stoure So boldlie by the bide. As for to cleaue the Spanish Host, Or force some sieged Towne, And combat done for Virgill serue To publish thy renowne.

And with the sound of thousand brookes Adiorned the sweetest sleepe Made cabinets faire at proofe of Sunne Which out his beames did keep: He squared a yard, and als he did, Plant, clenge, and labour syne The euerliuing fairnesse of A fertill Orchard fine: The Sacred Riuers courses als He parted here and there. And with a thousand collours paints The face of Meddowes faire. THE TRANSLATORS INVOCATION.

THE FVRIES. Where am I caried to? in world No more may I be found: The earth that I do tread vpon, And all this vaulted round, Which bringing home, &amp; guiding back The daies and nights againe, Be wrathfull now with me, reguides My longsum woe and paine: The aire I breath by longest draughts, The Sea I swimme into, Is not now of the first borne dayes The work most glorious lo. This wretched roundnes can not be The plenteous worlde no more, Which God with orn'ments brauelie deckt, So diuers and in store: No, this is but a Prison vyle, A Hell fulfild with fray, And of the first worlde but the tombe Most miserable alway. O SPRITE that quickens all, great God, That in thy justice maid, (Transformd from father myld in Iudge:) This changement that I said, Change me, and cast me ouer againe, Addres my feeble hand, And make that into my discourse No humane thing may stand. That I thy instrument may be, And eloquentlie syne, To our posteritie may sing This doolefull change of thyne. BEFORE our first fore-father had, Too impudentlie bold, His back turnd vnto God, his face Vnto the Serpent olde: Euen all this WHOLE, was like vnto Ane instrument in toone, Well set, and well accorded iust: And when as that was doone, So learn'dlie plaid on, as the sound Most rarelie dulce alway, Proclam'd the praise of God, who on The same did freedonne ay. The man in seruing God, was seru'd Of all the world apace: The bodies dead and liuing als, Did striue in euerie cace To nourish still that holie peace And with ane ardent loue, To please their double head, each other Embrast for that behoue. The lowest of a concord blest Resounded with the hie, The wak with dry, the cold agreed With that which hottest be. And syne that sacred innocent, the The bright ASTREA Queene, If fastned fast with mastik firme, Of holie loue that beene. This CVPID hid, that maries yet By straitest bonds and olde The Adamant stone with heauie yrne, Quick-siluer with the golde: The Ambre with the straw or chaff, And in the wauie raigne, PINNE with her spie, the Whaile with her That guides her through the Maine: That makes the Sperge so friendlie with The bosse and trembling Reed, The Mirt with Oliue tree, the Elme, With boughs that wine doe breed. That makes the earie Bustard with The galliard horse confether, And the Parroquets painted makes With Wolues to liue together, That ioynes the Moore-hen with the swift And feirie futted Hart, The Goat with Sargone, Partrichis With Does into ane part: All this is but a spunke, a glance, A shaddow and a trace, Of such a loue as raignd into The formest age allace: Where as our Muses low from heir With most harmonious sounds, Deuinely sang with them aboue Into the circled rounds. But Man as being the speciall, and The most resounding string Of this WHOLES Lute, too bended, out Of toone, doth with it bring The rest of brangling sinewes all, As now it rendre macks, In place of sweet enchanting air, So great and murmuring cracks, As ENYON makes astonisht quyte, Euen cruell ENYON who The old debaits of CHAOS does Renew with greener wo. The Heauen that euer fair did blincke Vpon his maistresse ay, That nought but MAN and Honny in Her brest did powre alway, Now sweeps her with his floods, and with His yce her dosinnis quyte, And beatis her with his haill, and gaigs Her with his fires in spyte: And with his snow doth make her olde, And ielouslie doth darde, Both night and day vpon her bones, His thundring fyerie farde. And RHEA that doth birst for spyte, And cholere in these daies, A thousand vapours blacke against The Heauen now doth she raise: And by the port halfe open of The gulfe profound and how, Does sudle all his brow with clouds, And mists that of her grow. The Cocke sensyne doth with his voyce The Lyon bold effray, The Glead, the Chicken: and the Sheepe, That baisdlie trembles ay, Flees from the rau'ning Woolfe: and in Great NEPTVNES fleeting plaine, The Lobster feares for Polipus: And Polipus againe For Congre-Eels feares: and neerthelesse, The selfe same Lobster to Ouercums this Eele, who victor is Euen of her victor lo: Yea, euen do, by a secret MARS, Most noysome quarrels ludge In very senselesse stocks of plants, Reteining still their grudge. Thou DENYS, euermore a childe, O Father sleepie still, If plant beside the leauie keall Thy fertill stocke they will, He drawes himselfe abacke beliue, And paile growne all his leaues, For spite, or feare, by flight himselfe From neighbourhead such bereaues. As in like maner, to reuenge The branches bearing wine, Neere Rew, and Origane, planted keal, By them is killed syne. The tree Dodonean, and the tree By ATTIQVE land beloued, The traces leaues of ancient pickes, Remaining vnremooued Euen in their widdow holes. O thou Invincible debate, That makes the one, ne liue can, where The other liu'd of late: That raignes into the verie tombe, Doth to the PARQVES resist, And neuer does thy hatred wash In flouds of LETHES mist. Euen so a Tambour cou'red with A simple muttons skinne, Doth burst affraidlie, onely at The sound and ratling dinne Of bloodie rauening Woolfs-skinne: And Sick-like the trypes well throwne Of that so glutton brigand, breakes With secret force vnknowne The guts of sheepe: whome in the place Of longsome bleating still, They after hend their death make on, A sweet Lute speake at will, And of the royall Egle als The strange deuouring plume, Does wondrously the fethers of All other foules consume. The Heauen, first mobile, with the selfe Doth carie and remoue More swifter farre then any wind, By this his course aboue The rest of all the heauens: backdrawing Their Torches giuing light, From ALEXANDERS Alters, to The Pillars HERCVLES pight. But mortall ADAM, as the king Of all things heere belaw, He being straied, vnto the way Of death does all things draw: And, blinded Pilot, on a Sea Most deadlie and in fire, This worlds Ship guides against the rocks Of furious heauenlie ire: Which softlie sliding of before, Was fleeting euer still, Both vnder-a skilfull Skipper, and A Zephyre calme at will. For or he did reuolt, he could Not cast his wondring eies Vpon no part, but through it all Almightie God he sees. He finds him in the earth, as to The Seas, he feeles him there, Contemplats him in Heauen, and sees Him painted in the air. Our world was nothing, but a great Large Shop, that open stood, Where magnifiquelie God displaid His treasures fair and good. This WHOLE was but a mirrour fair, Which bright on euery side, The goodnes represented viue, With great God that doth bide. But man vnhappy can not find, Since this his sinne and fall, Plant, stone, or liuing creature, Yard, wood, nor flood at all, Plaine, Feild, Hill, Dale, Sea, Shore, or Hauen, Where he may draw his breath, That hath not written into the brow The hard doome of his death. In short, euen all the compasse of This Fabrique large and round, Is but a very store-house of Gods wrath that doth abound. Man, in rebelling thus against The soueraigne great, I say, Doth feele his subjects all enarm'd Against him euerie way. The air by winds sturr'd, AMPHITRITE Doth stormie make a gild, The Heauen most sadlie black, The earth With brierie thornes fulfild, As fredd now from the oth of their Fidelitie and trust, The honour doe reuenge on him Euen of the Godhead just. The influence maligne of starres, Coniured doth prouide, A secret Hangman for to plague, His arrogance and pride. The Moone doth deaze and fundie him, Her brother rosts him quite, The air, when he lookes for it least, Pursues him in a spite By brimstoned thunders, and by raines, By blasting of the cornes, By frosts confirmd, hair-rimmes, and Snowes, And hailstones sharpe as thornes. And VVLCANE whiles fallin out of Heauen, Whiles irritate by art, Whiles kindled vnder richest roofes By chance in anie part, Whiles vom'd out of a mountaine, whose Tempestuous gulfe hath store, Both of Saltpeeter and of Pitch, And brimstone byting sore, Doth rage against him: startling still, For furie, as appeares, And wrackes in lesse space then a day, The labour-of thousand yeares. The Sea by her debording steales His Isles from him withall, His flockes vp-swallows, and ore-whelmes, His townes and makes them fall. The Earth all wearie on her face Such burthen for to keepe, (A burthen cursed and prophane,) Whiles sinks in darkest deepe A whole great countrie, and withall, The windie tops and hie Of proudest Palices, into Her entrailes hid they be. IT IS in hatred euen of him, That after manie wayes, She doth ingratelie barren haru'sts Produce vs now a dayes. And for the corne, that we do sow, (Deceitfull) doth vs pay With thirstles burning corne, and with The vaprous Darnell ay. And with the Fitches smoaring corne, With sticking Burres and rough, And guylefull hope of Windle-stray, That's but an emptie slough. All this were little, if that, as Step-mother cruell, sho Would not produce the Wort-berrie, Our furious enemie Lo: The Hen-bane blacke, and Ches-bow als, That cold-ryfe doth vs keepe, Doufe, yeuking flesh, and shuddring colde, And makes vs euer sleepe. The stonnishing Carpace, Humlocke als, That smores vs by his might, Yce-feet, Yce-hands, and makes vs isk, And dims our clearest sight. Sardonien Percell, Sennon-drawer, And with a laughing cheere, The Wolfe-bane, Burne-toung, swelling lips, And crying still with beere. The weeping Aconitum, and The Ixia binding sore, Sad hearted Flacke-wort, fosterer of Hydropsie more and more. March-Lillies als, that yeukars be, Of flancks the gnawers rude, The Mandragore full colde, and Ew, That kendles vp the blude. Plants, who doe by their root, their suck, Or by their little seed, A death vnmercifull, before The time vnto vs breed. The Earth that knowes we loue (as we Were bred, of brutish kindes,) Our life lesse, and our honour, then Her mettals hid in mindes: She with her hooks, deceitfullie, Doth mixe for vs and mell The scumme of Siluer and Arsenicke: Which cruell poyson fell Our inward parts deuours: and so Doth justlie punish right Our couetous lusts with torments sharpe That she makes on vs light. So as, whiles, from one onely mind, They (foolish) draw apace, The tortour of soule and martring of Our bodie both, allace. And what more shall I say? but that A Pilot full of skill, And aided by the breathing of A friendlie wind at will, He cannot with lesse trauell guide The winged fleeting Ship, That softlie on the azure salt Of humide fielde doth slip. And that the jugler fine, so well Can no waies make to dance, Make skarmushes, runne, and retire, And syne againe aduance His little Marmosets, whome to His auarice doth giue A Sprite, that by the onely art And workemanship doth liue, As we most happy did command The silent flocks, that do, All skalie, cleaue the stormie fluds, That they doe swimme into: And all the flying songsters sweet, And the rebellious bands, That rush out through the woods, or runnes Athwart the bairest lands: And at the wind euen of our voyce, They trembled fast afraid, And each winke of our eies, to them A law was they obaid: And to their holie office so They bent were night and day, As euen they vncommanded did Vs seruice euery way. But by the snappering that fell out Our Parents light among, Alas, they of our slaues are now Become our tyrants strong: The fearefull hideous Whale, if that We saile vpon the Maine, In weltring with a stroake, euen all At once, the bulluring plaine, Doth bury vnderneath the waues Our fleeting Castell fair, That plaies the Dolphin on the Seas, And Eagle in the air. And if we go into the feilds, So manie deadlie bands Od spotted venoms, and of Pests Cyniphien, on all hands Do lie into embuscade dern'd. The Wolfe on other side, With Lion, Sanglier, and with Beere And Leopard doth abide, Most iealous of the right diuine, Against their head conspire, And pitielesse teare him, in reuenge Of the eternall ire. The Forrests thick, they haue no bush, Nor thicket great at all, That doth not hide a hangman, to Giue vs our death and fall. We euery cauerne do suspect, And euery hedge we see, The smallest branch, that stighles, makes Vs sore afraid to be. If that, we dwelling be at home, The spitefull Mastie bolde, The Bull wood-headed, and the Horse, Whose courage cannot folde, With teeth, with horned brow, and with The feet do make vs warre Most sorie: seeing Tyrants such On earth, promenney darre. No; There is not so small a midge, That boldlie gainst vs cleene Will spare to shoot the arrowes of His little furie keene. ALAS: what hideous fraisome shapes? What horrible ghosts I see? What thundring loud? what roring cries? What terrible howlings hie? Am I not on the elrish Shore Of PHLEGETON, braying in Hell? O TISIPHON, MEGERE, ALECTO als, Thou furie sad and fell, What denne makes you the cauernes quite Most fraisome and profound Of darkest Hell? ô monsters most Abhominable vnder ground, Yee Ministers of PLVTO, with The throwne and stormie brow, O Daughters of the shadie night, What heere then do yee now? The man alas, without your crosse, Your whips and tortours sore, Doth he not feele the horrours els Of paines anew, and more? For our fore-beer, no sooner left The sacred soile of grace, To liue in earth, or rather in This Tombe and lowest place, Where raignes a thousand deaths, when as The voice eternall ay, Els thundring summond did the troupes, That guiltie were alway. That Sulphurd STYX and PHLEGETON, drinks All burning in a fire, Thicke ACHERON, and COCYTE als, All in a bloodie ire. O Sisters with the eddrie haire O Eumenids cruell yee, What? Of your selues for euermore, Will yee the tortourers be? Soone quite me all the horrour of Your cursed houses paile, Come vomit heere your poysons blacke In this vnhappy vaile. Haue yee no feare to languish heere, For exercises lake, For ADAM builds you a hundreth Hels Here for his vices sake. FROM top to bottome at these words AVERNE all trembled apace: The sweirest night, her horrours did Redouble in euery case. And als that stincking goulfe, where fraies Do raigne for euermore, Was suddaine fil'd with pitch, with Sulphre, And rozen in great store. The GORGONES, SPHINX, and HYDRAES, and The Pythons, monsters rair, The cauerns deepe did open of Their glutton bellies thair: Euen as the fire that hid into A vapour thicke remaines, Doth grudging murmure at the cloud, That pressing it retaines, Doth Cannon, thunder, astonish als, And whirling long in round, Doth, wrathfull, make the Element That windie is, resound. Euen so, these Sisters three, these three Most hideous rages vile, Do raise a thousand tempests, boun To leaue their hell a whyle. And each of them alreadie goes, And hurles his yrnie cart, Vpon the Bridges barres of yrne, Ay brangling on all part. That nine times Planks Stix, and in prison Where horrible darknes tumbles, With braying, running, wandring still, Most terrible horrible rumbles. Then fraifull HYDRE, and CERBERE als, That muttin makes a sturre, Who on one bodie hath the heads, Both of a Mastich curre, A Serpent, Bull, and of an Ounce, Whose cruell eies do pearce, And of a Woolfe, a Horse, a Beare, And of a Lyonesse fearce. With brangle of lights doth bark, doth whisle, And route doth euermore, Make murmuring, loudlie howle and bray, And rummish fast and rore. Such Pell-mell dinnes, and ringing reards, And tempests strange to heare, Do from one corps proceed at once, That manie heads doth beare. Then hauing of our day atteind Vnto the calmed port, Then wings of Aquilo they with A whirre more suddaine short Flee towards man: where with their hands Sore tortring they assay, Who cruellest paines can forge for him To suffer euerie way. OF ATROPOS the verie shape, Lo, Hunger comes at ones, Her blackned skinne is pearced with The sharpe points of her bones: She euer greedie longing gants, With hollow suncken eie, With cheekes togeather clapped close, And in her mouth they see Her wide-set teeth come Saffron hew'd: Her emptie bowels cleare, Do through the wrinckles of her skinne Transparantlie appeare. And for her bellie, hath she nought Of bellie but the place, Her knees and elbows hidelesse on Her carcasse swels apace. A monster most insatiable, Whome to, but for a fill, All that is liuing heere below, But skarcelie suffice will: Her swallowing throat goes seeking still Her meat in verie meats: One dish another summonds, and Her gourmand entrails eats, And toomes at once: The verie flesh Euen of her children young, May skantlie stanch her raging lust, Thus of her hunger sprung: But euen sometimes (ô gluttonie Of strangest sort and rare) To fill her foule-some guts, to eat Her guts she doth not spare: That she thereby, may make it more, She makes her body lesse, And to our father cruell so, She doth her selfe addresse. And furthermore, from hels she brings Vnto this combat heere, The rage, the weaknes, and the thrist, Her likest sisters deere. THE warre comes after, bruzing lawes, And bruzing maners all, Loue-teares, shed-blood, and burning Innes, And raizing euery wall: In-under his brasen feet, the earth All creepes and trembles fast, His mouth it is a firie coale, His voice a thunders blast: Each finger of his hand, it is A Cannon that doth bray, And euerie awfull looke of his A lightning flaming ay. The great disorder, and the fray, Dispair, and flight, do poste, And winged euer, go before His cruell murthering Hoste: As burnings, and the swelling pride, And great impietie vile, The quarrelous scisme, sacke, and all Impunitie for a while. The crueltie, the horrour, the Destruction and ruine, Though all accompanie him, whereas He barbrous marches syne. The doole, the solitarines, with The pouertie that peeps, The bloodie footsteps of his host Vndaunted following keeps. AND if that I be not deceau'd, Another furie lo That doth a battrie dresse against Our first forefather to, Of thousand thousand Cannons, I Her feele, though not in sight, The more that she is weake, the more Hath she of force and might: All vlcer'd feuerous, blind, and fond, And foolish is she nam'de. Sad, deafe, crooke-backed, and of legs And armes, both is she lam'de. The poyson with the manie names, Deaths minister alace, That comes at posting gallope, and Returnes at slowest pace. Ill-faououred, troubling rest, and als Fantastike, miserable eke, She kils, but cracke betraies the heart, Vnsatiable blood doth seeke, The daughter of intemperance, and Of Heauen misorder'd cleene, A cruell euill discouerd, but More cruell hid vnseene. IN SOMMER Meidowes, Grashoppers Haue not so many aboue, So manie Creikets vnder, as did Infernall voyces moue, And murmure round about, nor vnder A calmed Heauen and still, The King enamailed of the people, That gather Honnie will: So many little buzzing burds Guides not, when he doth cast Euen of his little hollow ludge The first foundations fast, As this effraying monster hath Of Soldats at command, That raging charge the man abaisd At euery part and hand. So as a regiment incens'd, And horrible giuing fraies, Not for to yoke a skarmish hot, The first of all assaies Gainst ADAMS head, which is the house Most holy hallowed ay, Of all the faculties of the soule, And reasons forth, and stay. A King that neighbours will bereaue Another Kings Empire, Before he fight into the feilds, Or open warres desire, He first corrupts by richest gifts His Counsels truth at length, Well knowing that a Counsell good Is of a King the strength. Euen so, this Furie banisht from The CHAOS darke and low, Do for Forerinners, Frenesie, And Madnes als let go: Whereof the one in heating much, The other drying sore The weake braines, they do stop the course, And blunt do more and more The sharpnes of mans judgement, and Engrauing makes remaine (Abusers) in the Spreit, a Squadre Of CHIMERS fancies vaine. The CAROS, POPLESIE, and the LETHARGIE sleeping ay, As casten of hazarders, assailes Their foe the best they may, At former part, but yet by armes, That are contrary clene, For making yci-colde the braines, His brethren dosened bene, And makes the liuing man like to A dead in euery sort, If of forgetfull LETHE, he Do not repasse the port. The Palsie els doth vndertake A warre and battaile bolde, Els Spasmus sturres, the one doth slacke, The other strait doth holde The Senewes of weake ADAM, els They doe the passage dit, Vnto the liuing subtill Spreits, That would go downe by it. Then euen as he, who hand to hand, And onely man to man Com'd to a Combat set, assaies All kind of wards he can, Eschewes, rebaits, strikes out, and doth Obserue his times aright, And casting whiles, doth make vpon The sparkling eies to light Of this his foe his cloake, syne with The farre end of his blead, Doth steadfast make his life to part In gushing streames and read. The sicknes, to the end that she May haue the better skair, Of our forefather tied to bed (Who scarse can turne him thair) Els with so many bonds she doth, The Ophthalmie let go, Which with a seething blood within The sight as cruell so, Giues thousand stogs, she also breeds The Pearl vpon the eie, That dimmes the shine, and Cataract, That darke and cloudie bee: Whereof the one by gathering of To grosse ane humour pight Within the bright Spreits guider, doth The dore close of the light. The other doth as with a cloath, Enuious syle and hide, The Cristall shining humour, that Doth in his eies abide. This done, euen with a gird to our Fore-beer flees withall, This cruell Dragon mercilesse, Whome squeinancy they call: That scoaps vnto his throat, and with Blood loppred lacking heat, He hauing of the how-throat bolle, The Muskles boldned great: In him alone doth giue a proofe, Of his so obstinate strength, Wherewith he is to fight, against His future race at length. Like HERCVLES, who when as yet, In swadling cloathes he lay, Buire on his brow engrau'd his great Vndaunted courage ay: Beginning with his hands, no hand But strongest turkesse els, Most boldlie wraithfull for to smoare The Dragon bearing shels, A maister stick that promises The Trophee Lernien sure, The Spaignoll triumph, and the firre Cleonien that they bure. The second regiment sets on By deadlie forces fell, Beginning with the Squadre of all The vitall parts to mell: That in the stomack camped are. And els that humour grosse Lights-stopper, him ASTHMATIQVE makes Ay panting in a Crosse. And the Corroziue flowing of A gutter dropping slow, His spongious lightes doth vlcerate, and Hims dries cum'd Ptisick so. The Peripneumonie withall A hote consuming braize, Goes cruell in his breathing boares And heat doth kendle and raize. And als the pittilesse Empiem doth Him sease among the rest, With an Apostume filling vp The howest of his brest. And furthermore the Pleurisie Doth brod him in the sides, In making euer boile that blood Which vnder his ribbes abides. The Mare therefter smores him and With thickest fleume doth he, As Spreit importune, heauie, presse His brest that panting be. MY GVIDE Vrania oracle That chassis errors vaine, Name me this warriour trembling ay, For furie and disdaine. And whose enarmed hand doth not, With firie torch assaile, The wings but euen the armies heart And ouer it doth preuaile. Who for his Campions hath the Cough, The irkesum ganting lo, The Souning swerfis, thirst, shuddering, and The colde-rife trembling to. The bating of the pulse, the heat, The rauing strange withall And paine of head. O is not this The furie whome we call The burning perrilous Feuer, who Inconstantlie doth take Mo faces then VERTVMNVS, and Who (fine) her selfe can make Continuall whiles, whiles tierce, whiles quart, And whiles but for a day, Whiles slow, whiles kindled vp, euen as The mater as they say Which in our feeble bodies is The cause of all this change, Hath slow, or promptlie ready hath This secreet motion strange. Well ought I for to know thee, ô Thou traitrous mastish vile, Who four years had thee in my hart, For hostesse all the while. So as I beare as yet euen of Thy greatest force, allace, The markes into my soule, and in The bodie many a trace. For leauing that thou soucked out, And cruellie did seeke The blood out of my veines, and of My bones the Marrov eik, I of my Spreit the vertue feele All slokened to be fall, The vigour of my Spreit cum'd gourd, The sharpnes blunted all. And als my memorie, the which Was somewhat yet before, Is like (ô dolour just) vnto The water, where a score Is als sone vanisht quite as drawne. Yea, surelie, I almost My former studies, to my shame, And greatest grief, haue lost. And als my Spreit a Table like, That voide, hath but a frame, Like Coruin, Trapesuntius, or Like Gaze, forgot my name, That Greek, whose learned voice, and whose Most facond hand and pen, Did teach the Romane language to The verie Romane men. And for that cause in spite of my Most carefull studies ay, My verse are feuerous now become, By habitude alway. Verse, sometimes animated, with A furie most deuine, And sometimes shuddering, with a most Vnlearned coldnesse syne. BVT of the Regiment that is third The cruell Squadres fall, Vnto the quarter, that conteines The vertues naturall all: The vertues that do piece and piece Most happely procure, Als-well our nourishment, as our Vp-growing alway sure. The Boulime whiles, whiles lacks of meat Through ANOREXIA will, Dog-hunger whiles, whiles lyes his meat Through BRADIPEPSIA still. Whiles she that makes the appetite, So monstrous and so great, In how parts of our stomack, doth She take her lodging seat. Then after with the Liuer doth The saffrond Gulsoch fight, For hauing stopt way to the Gall Chollerick, by his might He doth his kindled venome skaill Throughout the corps. (In place Of finest blood.) which outwardlie Turnes yeallow hewed apace. In contrare doufe Hydropsie makes Him like for colde to sterue Whill time it make the Fleume in place Of purest blood to serue. But I the sliddrie bowels see Below (allace) by foes Assaild, that are a thousand times Far mutinaire then those: The Colick with hir preson'd windes Breids them a raging paine, The dolour Iliack doth throw Them sore, most inhumaine Doth stop their purging conduits, and Detestable she makes Euen of manns mouth a pestilent And filthie stinking jakes. The read dissenterie all enarmed With throwings sore againe, Doth painefullie draw out the blood Of manie an opned vaine. The Stonie grauell doth the neares On other part inuade, By gathering of an humour, which The rigour of heat hath made To change into a Stone, which stops (Malicious) without more The sliddrie vreter, carier of Salt vrine skalding sore, Euen as the Diabete doth, by The contrair louse at last The greace of all our bodie in The vrine seething fast, And causing thirst, distils as much, As all the matter may, Full bruddie furnish raine vnto The gutter running ay. And to the members that vs makes, For ages following heere, Leaue of our bodies dead, so quicke And manie Mirrours cleere, Yoakes fiercely the vnablenes To liue in VENVS law: And the continuall flowing of The seed vnripe and raw. Who preasis (restlesse Tyrants) for To leese and to destroy The vnconceaued Babes thereby, Their Parents to anoy. The SQADRE fourt, wherein the Chouks, As Soldats do remaine, The vile deuouring Cancer, and The Gout a cruell paine, Together with the Hyues, and with The boudned Oedems cleare, Plouks, Shirres, and atrie Phlegmons, sends A hundreth brags with beare Vnto the place assieged, and syne, Their blind rage doth them make, Because they cannot harme the fort, The plaine field for to sacke. From hand in sheath ô cruell foes, Your mightlesse Swords let fall, The death a thousand times hath both Of blood and senews all, Bereft your foe, and nought the lesse, Without all hold or stay Your pitilesse hand his beautie doth Dishonour euery way His members all makes laidlie, and does With blunted knife beginne To saw his joynts, and Leiths, and for To hacke his wrinckled skinne. I thinke I see into the mid'st Of wilde and open lands, Of Wolues, and suttle Foxes als The cruell craftie bands, Who hauing on the softest Sand, By chance of meeting found The Lyon streaked, who on lyue Commanded all the ground, And whose most horrible austrun face (Retaining former spite) Did melt a far, euen with his beames, Their former boldnes quite: They (cruell) teare him, and against Their King that is deceased, Affraidly prooues, to practise that, Whereat, they feeblie preased. Shall I among these dwynings count. (Whose cruell boldnes fell, Seemes, as it were, with outward scroofe Of vexed man to mell?) The ouglie lowsie Phtiriase: ô The shamefull plague and vile, That euen makes Kings more filthie then Their Beggers all the while: Who clad with clouts, and eaten vp With Vermin euer still: Both night and day, for yeuking are Compel'd to fidge their fill. Kings swarming all with Lice, when as The rubbing cannot stay, Nor yet oft changed beds can giue Them slaiking any way. For euen as from a Surge, the Waues Are sliding after Waues: So swarme doth follow after swarme, Their flesh too fertill craues His owne deuourers to produce, And whill spent be the blood, It of it selfe the selfe doth make The execrable food. But what? Thinke not that Fortune blind, Whose turning Wheel still slides, The Campe of third EVMENIDE fell Confus'dlie pell-mell guides: I of her Soldats see, who as Conducted well by reason, Makes choyce, aswell of nature, age, As of the quartered season, The Portugall is bruddie so, In Phtisiques as we see: The Ebre in Chouks, the Arne in those That Epilepticke be, One Inde into Grangores, Sauoy In goitrous doth abound, In pest-folkes Sardine, Lepruse are In Ægypt many found. The places manners like, or the Strong influence aloft Of Mightie Heauen that gouerns all. So tender childhood soft, Is gnawn with Wormes, the children that Their rawnes gender will, And for their weakenes hes their wombe, That loose runnes euer still: The Skall vpon their head doth of Their saltest fleumes proceed. They for a time beare many a blybe Of worssome that doth breed Euen of the menstruall humour, which As new wine raging fast, In seething in the bodie, makes A plouckie skinne at last. The youth into Hemorragie Most easilie doth fall, In Feuers hot, in Dwinings, and In Phrenesie withall. And feeble age hath commonly For his too irksome Hosts, The coldrife bloodlesse shakings, and The fashious coughing hoasts, Katharres, and Gouts. So likewise the Sciaticke, hard to mend, The Feuer that the humour of Melancolie doth send. The bloodie fluxis, Pests, amd als The watrie swelling great Are nurished with vs when wake Autumnus brookes his seat. The Fike, the Skab, the Langour als Of ALCIDE doth vs take, And raging charge vs in the spring, That both is hot and wake. And then the Diarrhee, with the Hot euill, a seeknes sore, Assaileth vs importunatlie In Sommer euermore. As Pleurisie, the hoast and rheume Do seeldome make repaire, But couered with the whitest flocks Of heauenlie fethers fair, And Souldiers (sweirlie keeping home) Into the house do hold Of gelded sonne to aigit zeir, Their garnison full cold. And some I see (whose venome doth Delite but in a throng) Vnleauing of the first from corps To corps to slide along, As the Ameriquain, and als The Leprosie, and Byle, The Ptisie, mesels, and the pests Red Charbucle and vyle. And further some I see, which for Sadd heritage, allace, We (seiklie) leaue our sonnes, which they From age to age embrace. The Choakes and Goitre both into That ranke they euer stood, The Gout, the Grauell, Leprosie Withall that spilles the blood, Rumbursnes, white Hydropsie als, The languishing Ptisie eik, The Epilepsie dead withall, Bred of a vaprous reik, For the effect successiue of Thair Venome vnespied, Is to the flowing Sperma of Their fathers surelie tied. But ô allace: what stratagems, What strongest armes can we Now vse against those warriours, who Deceatfull traitours be. I meane these traiterous paines whome art, As most imperfite knowes Not by the name, but onely by, Effects that thereof growes. Such as the suffocation of The bruddie matrice quick, The Swowning wan, the skunnering euill That skailles conuentions thick. When as a vapour, I know not what, Long keeped close I trow, Into, I know not what a part, It doth, I know not how. Can he eschew the cruelties Fulfild with craftie wiles Of those so obstinate ills, who are, Abusers by their gyles Of cunning med'ceners hands, and who Once from the bodie chased, Are in the half dead members vnder An other name replaced. Or rather Schollers euen of the Fond Metempsichosis straunge Teacht by that SAMIEN learnd: The one Doth metamorphosd change In far worse ill. Cum'd either of Th'affinity that doth lye, Twixt faltish humors or betwixt, The members vext thereby: Or els through the vnlearnd abuse, Ot eh malitious greed, Of those that of Apollos arte, Are practisers indeed. Euen as the sturdie that transformd And changd is euerie way In Falling-ill, the Rage into Lethargie sleeping ay. The constitution ill into, Hydropesie full colde: The Slee-ping dulnes oft transform'd In Palsie doth vs holde. Short ADAM like a Hart is who Doth in a wodds nuik stay, And thrusting in into the soile Is at the latter bay All teared with lyam-hounds, whome of The one doth bite his back: One pulles his flanke, an other at His breast dooth bussie snack, One scoupes vnto his throate, and one His fouch is loath to leaue One holds his eare, and one vnto His neck doth hinging cleaue. He als is like a mightie Bull, Whose pridefull horne doth egg, The sleeprie byting little swarmes Of manie a spitefull cleg: Who bumming do come out, and their Assailer do assaile, And valiauntlie doe on his skin Their Squadre campe and naile, The Bull doth with his forked head, The windes beat euery where, The ground scraps with his cloves, his taile His sydes beates heere and there. And flying longs both forrests, rocks, And forcie streames and cleuches, The place where he receaued his hurt: But not his hurts eschewes. In end, with needels ouercled, Behoues him to be slaine, Or at the least as dead into That place for to remaine. For man he is inuaded with A thousand langors sore, And euery other liuing thing It gets a proofe no more But of a verie few of euils: The falln-ill onelie assailes, The Squadres gatherers of the hoat And the Venerian Quailes. The sheepe doth feare the skab, and als The dulling Sturdie still, The dog-ill, and the Madnesse they Oppres the mastish will. And further, euerie one of them Before his birth doth beare, Of strongest simples knawledge such As they haue need to leare. And neuer doth he feele his euill Steale neare to him so soone, But he als sone the remedie Hath readie to be done. For the slow-past Shelpaddock hath The Humlock icie-colde, To serue for soueraigne remedy, The Ramme doth rightlie hold The Rhew his counter-poison, and The Sacred Lawrell tree, For Reubarb serues to Partrich, Merle, And Gea that painted be, The Beare for medicine meet for him, The Mandragore obserues, And the Marcellian crommie for Lucinas Goates it serues. But we are ignorant of all, Euen after hauing had Acquired in bookes a knowledge, that Sophistique is and bad. An art ay snappring, and withall, A knowledge quite vnknowne, Which neuer enters but into The hoarie heads, and thrown Of men who worne, and broken with A labour too ingrate, In seeking others healthes, they leese Their owne, such is their state: Or rather, who do make themselues, By others perrils sore, Full famous Doctors, and by drinks Vntimous doe they store, And fill with Hillocks the Church-yard, And lacking feare or shame, Do bourreaus make themselues be paid, For murthers made by thame. I doe not speake heere of the good, The learned and the wise, Into whose hearts, the feare of God Imprinted deepely lies, And who doe skilfully within Our bodies stay and tie, Our spreits of life, that otherwise, Were readie out to flie: For I doe surely honor these, As heauenly men celest, Healthes leaning stocks, and bannishers Of euery death and Pest. Dame Natures counsellers, and the Almighties agents ay, And Stewards, and Store-maisters wise, Of flourishing age alway. But if that any paine by art Of man may slaked be, These learned learn'd it haue euen of Their Colledge dumme we see: For we doe the Phlebotomie Of the Sea-horsses take, Of the wilde Goats the Recipeis That for the eies we make. Of Ibis and the Heron we The laxatiue clisters haue, Of Beares and Lyons the Austere Great diets we receaue. Now all these Campions fearce they do, The bodie but persew. Some inwardly do make assault, And outwardlie anew: Or if that any take them to The soule most pleasant faire, That no waies is directlie but For that they will not spare To crosse her feeble Officers, And spoile her worklumes fine, Whereby she (learn'd) so many works Makes subtilie deuine. BVT Lo foure fearefull Captaines now, Whose furie hoat assaies, To dresse a batterie great against The Spreit in many waies: His constancie in a brangle puts, And promptlie drawes apace, Euen from the path of reason quite, Their judgement blind alace, Opinions Children who thought they Inuisible be cleine, Yet they their harmefull motions through, The bodies makes to sheine. The first is irksomnes, the which A drumlie cloud doth holde, And from the crowne euen of the head, Vnto the foot doth folde: Doth rauing drant both night and day, Growes old or age be neere, The longest skorie wrinckles on His face as Furres appeare: And in a dowisome quiet nooke He carefull euer thrists, Als manie sighs out of his breast, As teares from eies out brists. He guides the tarndnesse, which to eat The selfe doth neuer faile, The weeping pitie, and withall The heauie sadnes paile: And the enrag'd dispair, which with Straiks blea-hewde beats the sell, Who with Coales, Aspiks, Tedders als For Armour meet doth mell. The throwart eied enuie withall Fat of the leanes ay Of dearest friends, who restleslie Doth gnaw her selfe away. Like famisht POLIPYS, who in Vnhaps doth bath her still, And (most ill willie) but on teares Her wrath doth feed and fill. And als the jelousie, which but To slumber once doth feare, And euer (most suspicious) hath The Flea into the eare: And farre mo eies then he who being By HERMES witcht at last, Did the Inachien beautie let Be stolne he sleeping fast. THE Second Captaine sure is joy, Excessiuelie to glade, Who skoups, and lightlie startles, and Whome to the street that made By APPIVS was, to narrow is, Whose sences all they do Euen at the wishes als enjoy Most pleasant pleasures to: Who guides effronted vanterie that Doth euer faine and lie, A flatterer, and importune, and That euer crying be: And pride brow-bender Gyant who Wings on his backe doth beare, And with his loftie forhead hits, The Starrie sylring cleare: And many others like the Bels, Who boldned in a raine, Do swelling emptie rise vpon The wake and humid plaine. The feare whose sides incessantly Do bussie beat apace, Whose bosome hath no heart, nor vaines Haue blood in any case: Nor spreit hath counsaile, yet she daunts Vs quite that feeble dame, Euen with the terrour pale, and with The Land-wart blushing shame: And swearnesse als at slowest pace Which euer comes and creepes, The which with willing yrnes her armes At all times fastned keepes: Who lashlie dreames both night and day, A barren, vndought eik, A vile paralitique feeble one, Who begging aid doth seeke. And thou ô Couetousnes the which The earth, nor yet the aire, Nor sea, or heauen can euer fill Or stanch thy lusting caire. Who crookes for eyes, and groundlesse deepes, For entrailles carries ay, And clookes for hands, thou fences with Poore ADAM euery way, Thou does vnto the combate bring, Ambition boudned vaine, That burnes in slow and soaking fire, Whose passion to containe Or bound in EPICVRVS worlds, Is bootelesse to essay, Who in his hand doth Scepters als In paintrie carrie ay. Thou brings the greedie Auarice, Enarmed all with cleekes, And cled with glew, who neuer briggs For her safe passage seekes, Both through CHARIBDIS baying, and Through traitrous SYRTES fell. Who growes the miserabler the more Her wealth growes with her sell. A monster fierce without respect, Or loue, or faith, who will Her neighbours sorelie harme, but yet Her self more euer still. Who puts her hand in euerie thing, Mœchanicklie too vyle. Lyke TANTALVS in middst of goods, Full poore euen all the whyle. Who nombers neuer what she hath, But what she lak'th doth count, A foule, who though well winged, yet She hie doth neuer mount. Thou wrathfull contrare ADAM does Lead forward to the warre, The wrath, the which alreadie goes Then thunder swifter farre. Who sullen like a Sanglier makes Her awfull teeth to crack, Her haire starts wouddershunes, and whiles Her burning eyes doth make To reill, whiles tieth them to the ground: Whose horrible face it will Whiles paill, whiles firie, rout with voice Most wilde and elrage still: The ground stamps with her feet, her hands On other rash apace: She poison, fire, and cruell sworde, Into that foming cace Beares in her hand, them for to kill, Whome syne she doth lament, And lightlies death prouiding that Her fellow also went: Like as a hinging wall which by The winde louse shaken bene, Doth bruze the selfe on that, the which Vnder it all bruz'd is clene. Thou makes vnto the fight to come Squar'd arrowes-bearer loue, Which tyrants painting will I not After all th'Apellesis proue That FRANCE hath borne, and shortlie then, Beneath thy Standarts faire, Thou makes als manie Soldats els For to be marching there As there be verry goods, or for Resemblance so doth trow The King of beasts who of him selfe Is not the maister now. But if these passions that pursewes And touches vs so neere, Would swiftlie passe away as doth A glancing lightening cleere Then were it nothing, but allace They oftentimes doe leaue The venomed sting into the soule Which hurting they deceaue: From that so drumlie spring doth flow, The deadlie poisons fell, The SODOMIES, thefts, and incests, And treasons vile to tell. The blasphemies, the false contracts, Conspiring, drunkenesse eik, The Sacriledge, wait-laying, murther, And Reafe that praies do seek. Allace these langors (that be worse Then thousand deaths be farr,) Are different from the langores that Makes with the bodie warre. Who are auowedlie enemies, And by their malice do, Giue to the Patient manie a signe Of healthes attaining to, Whiles by the brangling pulse, and whiles Euen by their colour viue, Whiles by the stinging needels of Strong dolour that doth grieue. So as well knowing once the euill, That doth vs brooke and binde, It is not too difficill syne, The remedie to finde. But these our euils for that they in Our vnderstanding raigne, Who onelie ought and may discerne Of them, they do remaine Vnknowne at all and for that cause Doth PODALIRIVS stay, To runne to ANTICIRE to get His health in anie way. And furthermore the Feuerous man, We feuerous do him call, Hydropique we hydropique name, Dissimuling not at all Inunder the deceatfull masque, Of fained words the paine That crewell, doth our members with Her torments sharpe demaine. Contrariwise, the Spreit is of The self the flatterer ay, The owne skabb clawes, and with a style That lyar is alway By cloaking of his vices lets The Vlcer blinde to feare, The Cautere needles quite for it Of reason for to heare: And sure if vice did euer cleith The self in anie where With the vnspotted famous cloak Of holie vertue faire It certainlie is in our age Worse by a hundreth folde, Then when on all the earth the waues Quite vniuersal rolde. Of sinnes discourse I will not that Are vildest in degree, Wherewith the bedds infamous of The greatest spotted be. For feare that in offending of The holies tender eare, I rather seeme to teach them then To wish them to forbeare. They who vpon their bodies with Grangores gnawne and deformed, Beares Woods, faire Meidowes, Castles als In threads of Gold transformed, And whose hands prodigall into Once shifting of the Cairts, One Iusting proud, one Banquet great, Doe wast with glorious hearts The treasures gathered by the paines And niggard trauels sore, Of their forebeers occurrars, cal'd Are liberall euermore. They whose affected going, and Whose fairded deintie cheekes, Whose accent all effeminat, Whose bonnie blincks and keeks, Whose feeble coward heart and spreit, Whose soft and souple weed Declares, that they are onelie men Of outward shew indeed, O these be courtlie proper and feat. Those who from bed to bed Like Goat-bucks wander vagabonds, Whose charming mouthes haue led And chaste SVSANNAES tysted halfe And euer famisht, flee To euerie pray: ô surely these Are Louers cal'd we see. They who by false contracts, and by Vnlawfull measures do Acquire (oppressours) substance, yea, And princely riches too: And goes Sophisticating all The simple strangers ay, And hundreths doe for hundreths lend, Are Stewards good they say. Who in reuenges badd desire, Do euer thrist and burne, Who bathes themselues in blood, and puts No difference in their turne Of ranke, of Sexe, of age, but still Most cruell they defile, Colde blooded into euery corps Their murthering hands and vile, Are men of most magnanime spreit. O would to God that FRANCE Were voyd of men of spreit, since that Our manhead doth aduance, And fight for our ilwillers, and Suckes out our blood apace, Makes wast our Cities, and doth bresh Our verie sides allace. O would to God the Targe, the Pike, The Sword might changed be In ploughs for to mannure the Land. O shall I neuer see The Spiders long and threadie feet Full busie for to weaue, Within the hollowest of a healme Deckt with a pennage braue? But if ye French-men greene so fast, To Battailes for to go, And if that awfull Ennyon seethes Into your bowels so, What gaine or profite holdes you heere, And makes you stay so long? Our fields of bestiall voyd, of wealth Are all our Cities strong. Then go ye, runne ô warlike youth Whome no distresse can dant, Another Gaulien Greece into Natolia for to plant: Go run in Flanders, and do yee Most mercifull releeue Your brethren Belges from the yoake Of Spaine that doth them greeue. Run vnto Portugale, and people Of new Gallicia now, And do your names engraue againe In PORT-VLISSES brow. THus louing Reader as thou sees, Now haue I made an end, Vnto this worke which man did write, But by the Lord is pend: Wherein as I haue preast to make The Authour knowne to all, That into Brittaine Ile remaine, Where he before was thrall Within the onelie bounds of France, So doubt I not thou will Excuse my blotting of his face, And blame my lacke of skill Which letted me to imitate His hard and loftie verse, His arrowes headed blunt by me, As earst could no waies pearce. But since both profite may heerein, And pleasure reaped be, Though metamorphos'd all I grant, And quite transform'd by me: Yet ought thou justlie loue and like My painefull trauels bent, It is sufficient vnto me, Thou know my good intent. FINIS. THE LEPANTO OF IAMES the sixt, King of Scotland. THE LEPANTO OF IAMES THE SIXT, King of Scotland. I sing a wondrous worke of God, I sing his mercies great, I sing his justice heere-withall Powr'd from his holy seat. To wit, a cruell Martiall warre, A bloodie battell bolde, Long doubtsome fight, with slaughter huge And wounded manifold. Which fought was in LEPANTOES gulfe Betwixt the baptiz'd race, And circumsised Turband Turkes Rencountring in that place. O onely God, I pray thee thrise, Thrise one in persons three, Alike Eternall, like of might, Although distinct yee be. I pray thee Father, through thy Sonne, Thy word immortall still, The great ARCHANGEL of records And worker of thy will, To make thy holie Spreit my Muse, And eik my pen inflame, Aboue my skill to write this worke To magnifie thy name. INTO the turning still of times, I erre, no time can be, Where was and is, and times to come, Confounded are all three. I meane before great God in Heauen, (For Sunne and Moone deuides The times in Earth by houres and dayes, And seasons still that slides.) Yet Man, whome Man must vnderstand, Must speake into this cace, As man, our flesh will not permit, Wee heauenlie things imbrace. Then, as I els began to say, One day it did fall out, As glorious God in glistering throne, With Angells round about Did sit, and Christ at his right hand, That craftie Satan came, Deceauer, Lyar, hating man, And Gods most sacred name. This olde abuser stood into The presence of the Lord, Then in this manner Christ accus'de, The sower of discord. I know thou from that City comes, CONSTANTINOPLE great, Where thou hast by thy malice made The faithles Turkes to freat. Thou hast inflamde their maddest mindes With raging fire of wraith, Against them all that doe professe My name with feruent fayth. How long ô Father shall they thus, Quite vnder foote be tred, By faithles folkes, who executes What in this snake is bred. Then Satan answerd, Fayth? quoth he, Their Faith is too too small, They striue me thinke on either part, Who farthest backe can fall. Hast thou not giuen them in my hands, Euen boath the sides I say, That I, as best doth seeme to me, May vse them euery way? THEN IEHOVA, whose nod doth make, The heauens and mountaines quake, Whose smallest wrath the centres makes, Of all the Earth to shake, Whose worde did make the worlde of nought, And whose approouing syne, Did stablish all even as wee see, By force of voice deuine. This God began from thundering throte, Graue wordes of waight to bring, All christians serues my Sonne though not Aright in everie thing. No more shall now these Christians be With Infidels opprest, So of my holie hallowed name The force is great and blest. Desist, ô tempter. GABRIEL come O thou ARCHANGEL true, Whome I haue oft in message sent To Realmes and Townes anew. Go quicklie hence to Venice Towne, And put into their minds To take reuenge of wrongs the Turks Haue done in sundrie kinds. No whisling winde with such a speed, From hilles can hurle ore heugh, As he whose thought doth furnish speed, His thought was speed aneugh. This Towne it stands within the Sea, Fiue miles or there about, Vpon no Ile nor ground, the Sea Runnes all the streets throughout. Who stood vpon the Steeple head Should see a wondrous sight, A Towne to stand without a ground, Her ground is made by slight: Strong Timber props dung in the Sea Do beare her vp by art, An Ile is all her market place A large and spacious part, A Duke with Senate joyned doth rule, Saint MARKE is patron chiefe, Ilk yeare they wedde the Sea with rings To be their sure reliefe. The Angell then ariu'd into This artificiall Towne, And chang'd in likenes of a man, He walkes both vp and downe, While time he met some man of spreit, And then began to say, What doe we all? me thinke we sleepe: Are we not day by day By cruell Turks and infidels Most spitefullie opprest? They kill our Knights, they brash our forts, They let vs neuer rest. Go too, go too, once make a proofe: No more let vs desist, To bold attempts God giues successe, If once assay we list: With this he goes away, this man Vnto another tels The purpose whereunto they both Agree among them sels. This other to another tels, And so from hand to hand It spreads and goes, and all that heard It, necessare it fand. And last of all, it comes vnto The Duke and Senates eare, Who found it good, and followed furth The same as ye shall heare. THE Towne was driuen into this time, In such a piteous strait By Mahometists, that they had els Giuen ouer all debait: The Turke had conquest Cyprus Ile, And all their lands that lay Without the bounds of Italie, Almost the whole I say: And they for last refuge of all, Had moou'd each Christian King To make their Churches pray for their Reliefe in euerie thing. The Towne with piteous plaints did call Vpon the Lord of might, With praying still and fasting oft, And groning all the night, Was nothing heard but sobs and sighs, Was nothing seene but teares, Yea sorrow draue the brauest men With mourning to their beares. The women swound for sorrow oft, The babe for woe did weepe, To see the mother giuing milke Such dolefull gesture keepe. Young men and maids within the towne Were ay arraid in blacke, Each Eau'n the Sunne was sooner hid Then earst, the night to macke. No VENVS then, nor CVPID false durst kyth or once appeare, For paile distresse had banisht them, By sadde and sory cheare. As Seas did compasse them about, As Seas the Streets did rin, So Seas of teares did ever flowe, The houses all within. As Seas within were joyned with howles, So Seas without did raire, Thair carefull cries to Heauen did mount Resounding in the aire. O stay my Muse, thou goes too farre, Shewe where we left before, Lest trikling teares so fill my penne That it will write no more. THEN VENICE being in this state, When GABRIEL there was sent, His speaches spred abroad, made Towne And Senat both so bent To take reuenge, as they implorde The Christian Princes ayd, Of forces such, as easilie, They might haue spard and maid. At last, support was granted them, The holie league was past, Als long to stande, as twixt the Turkes And Christians warre shoulde last. It was agreed, that into March, Or Aprill every yeare, The armie shoulde on easterne Seas, Convene from farre and neare. THVS bent vpon their interprise, The principalls did conveene, Into MESSENA to consult, What order should haue beene, Obseru'd in all their armie great: There DON IOAN d'AVSTRIA came, Their Generall great, and VENIER als Came there in Venice name. From GENES ANDREA DOREE came And Rome COLONNE sent, When they with others many daies Had into counsaile spent, In end ASCAGNIO DE LA CORNE A Martiall man and wise His counsaile gaue, as ye shall heare Vpon their enterprise. THREE causes be (ô Chieftaines braue) That should a Generall let, On Fortunes light vncertaine wheele The victorie to set: First, if the losse may harme him more, Then winning can auaile, As if his Realme he doe defend From them that it assaile: The next is when the contrare Host Is able to deuide For sicknes sore or famine great Then best is to abide. The third and last, it is in case His forces be too small, Then better farre is to delay, Then for to perish all: But since of these two former points We need not stand in doubt, Then though we leese, we may defend Our Countries round about. As to the last, this armie is So awfull strong and faire, And furnisht so with necessares Through your foreseing cair, That nought doth rest but courage bolde. Then since your state is such, With trust in God assay your chance Good cause availeth much. But speciallie take heede to this, That ere yee make away, Ye order all concerning warre, Into their due array: For if while that yee see your foes, Yee shall continewe all, Then shall their suddaine sight with feare Your brauest Spreits appall, Each one commande a sundry thing, Astonisht of the cace, And everie simple Soldat shall Vsurpe his Captaines place. This counsall so contents them all, That everie man departs, With whispering much, and so resolues With bolde magnanime harts. Their preparations being made, They all vpon a day, Their biting ankers, gladlie wayed, And made them for the way. The Grecian Fleet, for HELENS cause That NEPTVNS town did sack: In braue array, or glistring armes, No match to them could mak. There came eight thousand Spaniards braue, From hotte and barren SPAINE, Good ordour kepars, cold in fight, With proud disdainfull braine. From pleasant fertill ITALIE, There came twelue thousand als, With subtill spreites bent to reuenge, By craftie meanes and fals. Three thousande ALMANS also came, From Countries colde and wide, These monney men with awfull cheare The chok will dourelie bide. From diuers partes did also come, Three thousand venturers braue, All voluntaires of conscience mou'd, And would no wages haue. Armde Galleyes twice a hundr' and eight Six shippes all wondrous great, And fiue and twentie loadned Shipps With baggage and with meate. With fourtie other little barkes And prettie Galents small, Of these aforesaid was compound The Christian Nauie all. THIS cloude of Gallies thus began On NEPTVNS back to rowe, And in the Shippes the marriners Did skippe from towe to towe. With willing mindes they hailde the Tyes, And hoist the flaffing Sayles, And strongest towes, from highest mastes, With force and practique hayles. The Forceats lothsomlie did rowe, In Gallies gainst their will, Whome Galley masters oft did beat, And threaten euer still. The foming Seas did bullor vp, The risking Oares did rashe, The Soldats peeces for to clenge Did shoures of shotts delashe. BVT as the Deuill is reddie bent, Good workes to hinder ay, So sowd he in this Nauie strife, Their good successe to stay: Yet did the wisdomes of the Chiefes And of the generall most, Compound all quarrels and debates That were into that Host, Preferring wisely as they ought, The honor of the Lord, Vnto their owne, the publicke cause, To priuate mens discord. THE feathered fame of wondrous speed That doth delite to flee On tops of houses pratling all That she can heare or see, Part true, part false: this monster strange Among the Turkes did tell, That diuers Christian Princes joyned, Resolu'd with them to mell. Then spies were sent abroad, who tolde The matter as it stood, Except in Arithmetique (as It seemd) they were not good, For they did count their number to Be lesse then was indeed, Which did into the great Turks mind A great disdaining breed: A perrillous thing, as euer came Into a Chieftaines braine, To set at nougth his foes (though small) By lighleing disdaine. Then SELYM sent a nauie out, Who wanderd without rest, Whill time into LEPANTOES gulfe They all their Ankers kest. IN season when with sharpest hooks The busie shearers cowe The fruitfull yallow lockes of golde, That doe on CERES growe, And when the strongest Trees for weight Of birth do downward bow Their heauie heads, whose colourd knops In showers raines ripelie now, And Husband-men with woodbind crownes To twice borne BACHVS dance, Whose pleasant poyson sweet in tast, Doth cast them in a trance: Into this riping season sure, The Christian Host I say, Were all assembled for to make Them Readie for the way: But or they from MESSENA came, The Vines were standing bair, Trees voyd of fruit and CERES polde, And lacking all her hair: But when that leaues, with ratling falles In banks of withered boughes, And carefull laborers do begin, To yoke the painefull ploughes The Nauies neere to other drew, And VENIER (sent before) Gaue false Alarum, sending word, The Turks had skowp'd the score. That fiftie Galleis quite were fled, This word he sent expresse, To make the Christians willinglie To battell them addresse, As so they did, and enterd all, (Moou'd by that samin flight.) Into LEPANTOES gulfe, and there Preparde them for the fight. WHILL this was doing heere on earth, Great God who creats all, (With wakrife eie preordoning What euer doth befall.) Was sitting in his pompous Throne, In hiest Heauen aboue, And gloriouslie accompanied With justice and with loue: The one hath smiling countenance, The other frowning cheare, The one to mercie still perswades Him as a Father deare, The other for to powre his plagues Vpon repining sinne, And fill the fields with wofull cries, The houses all with dinne, But yet the Lord so temperates them, That both doe brooke their place, For Iustice whiles obtaines her will, But euermore doth grace: IEHOVA als hath ballances, Wherewith hee weighs aright The greatest and the heauiest sinnes, With smaller faults and light, These grace did mooue him for to take, And so he weighed in Heauen, The Christian faults with faithlesse Turkes, The ballance stood not eauen, But sweid vpon the faithlesse side: And then with awfull face, Frownd God of Hosts, the whirling Heauens For feare did tremble apace, The staiest Mountaines shuddred all, The grounds of earth did shake, The Seas did bray, and PLVTOES Realme For horrour colde did quake. HOVV soone AVRORAS ioyfull face, Had shead the shadie night, And made the chiuering Larks to sing For gladnes of the light, And PHOEBE with inconstant face, In Seas had gone to rest, And PHOEBVS chasing vapours moist, The Skie made blew celest: The Generall of the Christian Host Vpon his Galley Mast, The bloodie signe of Furious MARS Made to bee fixed fast. Then as into a spacious towne, At breaking of the day, The busie worke-men doe prepare Their Worklumes euery way, The Wright doth sharpe his hacking Axe, The Smith his grinding File, Glasse-makers beets their fire that burnes Continuall not a while, The Painter mixes colours viue, The Printer Letters sets, The Mason clinckes on Marble Stones, Which hardlie drest he gets: Euen so, how soone this Warriour world With earnest eies did see Yon signe of Warre, they all prepard To winne or els to die: Heere Hagbutters prepard with speed A number of Bullets round, There Cannoners, their Canons steild To make distroying sound, Here Knights did dight their burnisht brands, There Archers bowes did bend, The Armorers on Corslets knockes, And Harnesse hard did mend, The feirie Marriners at once Makes all their tackling clair And whispering dinne, and cries confus'de, Preparing here and there: As busie Bees within their Hyues With murmuring euer still, Are earn'st vpon their fruitfull worke Their emptie holes to fill. The Flags and Enseigneis were displaid, At ZEPHYRS will to waue, Each painted in the colours cleere Of euery owner braue. BVT all this time in carefull minde, The Generall euer rolde, What manner of array would best Fit such an Armie bolde, To pance on this it paind him more, This more did trouble his brest, Then Canons, Corse-lets, Bullets, tackle, And swordes, and bowes, the rest, And at the last with ripe aduise, Of Chieftaines sage and graue He shead in three in Cressents forme, This martiall Armie braue: The Generall in the battaile was, And COLONNE vndertooke The right wing with the force of GENES, The left did VENIER brooke. WHEN this was done, the Spanish Prince Did row about them all, And on the names of speciall men With louing speach did call, Remembring them how righteous was Their quarrell, and how good, Immortall praise, and infinit gaines, To conquer with their blood, And that the glorie of God in earth, Into their manhead stands, Through just reliefe of Christian soules From cruell Pagans hands: But if the ennemie triumphed Of them and of their fame, In millions men to bondage would Professing Iesus name. The SPANIOL Prince exhorting thus With glad and smiling cheare, With sugred wordes, and gesture good, So pleas'd both eie and eare That euerie man cryed victorie: This word abroad they blew, A good presage that victorie Thereafter should ensew. THE Turquish Host in maner like Themselues they did array, The which two, BASHAAS did command And order euerie way. For PORTAV BASHA had in charge, To gouerne all by land, And ALI-BASHA had by Sea, The onely cheife command, These BASHAAS in the Battaile were, With mo then I can tell, And MAHOMET BEY the right wing had, The left OCHIALI fell. Then ALI-BASHA visied all With bolde and manly face, Whose tongue did vtter courage more Then had alluring grace: He did recount amongst the rest What victorie Turks obtaind On catife Christians, and how long The OTTOMANS race had raignd. He told them als, how long themselues Had victours euer bene, Euen of these same three Princes small, That now durst so conuene, And would yee then giue such a lie Vnto your glories past, As let your selues be ouerthrowne By loosers at the last? This victorie shall Europe make To be your conquest pray, And all the rare things thereintill, Ye carry shall away: But if ye leese, remember well How ye haue made them thrall, This samin way, or worse shall they Demaine you one and all, And then shall all your honours past In smoke euanish quite, And all your pleasures turne in paine In dolour your delite: Take courage then, and boldlie to it, Our MAHOMET will aid, Conducting all your shots, and stroakes, Of Arrow, Dart, and blaid: For nothing care but onely one Which onelie doth me fray, That ere with them we euer meet For feare they flee away: This speach did so the Armie please, And so their minds did mooue, That clincks of Swordes, and rattle of Pikes, His speaches did approoue. THE glistering cleare of shining Sunne Made both the Hosts so glance, As fishes eies did reele to see Such hewes on Seas to dance: But TITAN shinde on eies of Turkes And on the Christian backes, Although the wauering wind the which But seldome setling tackes, The Turkes did second euer still Whill but a little space Before the chocke, ô miracle, It turnd into their face, Which Christians joyfull as a seale And token did receaue, That God of Hosts had promis'd them They victorie should haue. HOVV soone a Cannons smokie throat The Seas did dindle all, And on BELLONA bolde and wise, And bloodie MARS did call, And that the sounding cleare of brasse Did als approoue the same, And kindled courage into men To winne immortall fame. But what? Me thinke I doe intend This battaile to recite, And what by Martiall force was done My pen presumes to write, As if I had yon bloodie God And all his power seene, Yea to descriue the God of Hosts My pen had able beene: No, no, no man that witnes was Can set it out aright, Then how could I by heare-say do, Which none can do by sight: But since I rashlie tooke in hand, I must assay it now, With hope that this my good intent Ye Readers will allow: I also trust that euen as he Who in the Sunne doth walke Is colourd by the samin Sunne, So shall my following talke Some fauour keepe of Martiall acts, Since I would paint them out, And God shall to his honour als My pen guide out of dout. THIS warning giuen to Christians they With Turks yoake heere and there, And first the sixe aforesaid Ships That were so large and fair, And placed were in the former ranks, Did first of all persew With Bullets, Raisers, Chaines, and nailes, That from their peeces flew: Their Cannons rummisht all at once, Whose mortall thudding draue, The fatall Turks to be content With THETIS for their graue. The Fishes were astonisht all, To heare such hideous sound, The Azur Skie was dim'd with Smoke, The dinne that did abound, Like thunder rearding rumling raue With roares the highest Heauen, And pearst with pith the glistering vaults Of all the Planets seauen: The piteous plaints, the hideous howles, The greeuous cries and mones, Of millions wounded sundrie waies, But dying all at ones, Conjoynd with former horrible sound, Distemperd all the aire, And made the Seas for terrour shake With braying euery where: Yet all these vnacquainted roares, The feareful threatning sound, Ioynd with the groning murmuring howles The courage could not wound So farre of Turquish Chieftaines braue, As them to let or fray With boldest speed their greeuous harmes With like for to repay, Who made their Cannons bray so fast And Hagbuts cracke so thicke, As Christians dead in number almost Did countervaile the quicke, And sent full many carcages Of Seas to lowest ground, The Cannons thuds and cries of men Did in the skie resound: But Turks remaind not long vnpaid Euen with their proper coyne, By bitter shots which Christians did To former thundring ioyne: Dead drop they downe on euery side, Their sighing Spreits eschews, And crosses Styx into disdaine, To heare infernall newes: Yea skarcelie could the ancient bote Such number of soules containe, But sobbed vnderneath the weight Of Passengers prophane. While here the Father stood with Sonne, A whirling round doth beare The lead that dings the Father in drosse And fils the Sonne with feare, Whill there a Chieftaine shrillie cries, And Soldats doth command, A speedie Pellet stops his speach, And staies his pointing hand, Whill time a clustered troupe doth stand Amasst together all, A fatall Bullet them among Makes some selected fall: The hideous noise so deaf'd them all, Increasing euer still, That readie Soldats could not heare Their wise commanders will, But euery man as MARS him mou'd, And as occasion seru'd, His dutie did the best he might, And for no perrill sweru'd, Their olde commanders precepts past They put in practise then, And onely memorie did command That multitude of men. THVS after they with Cannons had Their dutie done a farre, And time in end had wearied them Of such embassad warre, A rude recounter then they made, Together Galleis clipt, And each on other rasht her nose, That in the Sea was dipt: No manner of man was idle then, Each man his armes did vse, No skaping place is in the Seas Though men would MARS refuse: The valiant Knight with Coutlasse sharpe Of fighting foe doth part The bloodie head from bodie pale: Whill one with deadlie dart Doth pearce his enemies heart in twaine, An other fearce doth strike Quite through his fellowes Arme or Leg, With pointed brangling Pike: The Cannons leaues not thundering of, Nor Hagbuts shooting still, And seldome Powder wasts in vaine But either wound or kill: Yea euen the simple forceats fought With beggers boltes anew, Wherewith full manie principall men They wounded sore and slew: Whill time a Christian with a sworde, Lets out a faithlesse breath, A Turke on him doth with a darte, Reuenge his fellowes death, Whill time a Turk with arrow doth, Shoot through a Christians arme, A Christian with a Pike dooth pearce The hand that did the harme: Whill time a Christian Cannon killes A Turke with threatning sound, A Hagbut hittes the Cannoner, Who dead, falles to the ground: The beggers boltes by forceates casten, On all hands made to flie, Iaw-bones and braines of kild and hurt, Who wisht (for paine) to die: The clinkes of swords, the rattle of Pikes, The whirre of arrowes light, The howles of hurt, the Captaines cryes In vaine do what they might, The cracks of Gallies broken and bruzd, Of Gunns the rumbling beire Resounded so, that though the Lord Had thundered none could heare: The Sea was vernished red with blood, And fishes poysond all, As IEHOVA by MOSES rod In Aegipt made befall. THIS cruell fight continued thus Vncertaine all the while, For Fortune oft on either side, Did frowne and after smile, It seem'd that MARS and PALLAS both Did thinke the day too short With bloodie practise thus to vse Their olde acquainted sport: For as the slaughter ay increast, So did the courage still, Of Martiall men whome losse of friends Enarm'd with eigre will, The more their number did decrease The more that they were harmd, The more with MARS then were they fild With boldning spite inarm'd: Now vp now downe on either side, Now Christians seemd to winne, Now ouerthrowne, and now againe, They seemd but to beginne. My pen for pitie cannot write, My hair for horrour stands, To thinke how many Christians there Were kild by Pagane hands. O Lord throughout this Labyrinth Make me the way to vew, And let thy holy three-folde Spreit Be my conducting clew: O now I spie a blessed Heauen, Our landing is not farre: Lo good victorious tidings comes To end this cruell warre. IN ALL the time that thus they fought, The Spanish Prince was clipt With ALI-BASHA, whome to meet The rest he had oreslipt: And euen as throughout both the Hosts, Dame Fortune varied still, So kythde she twixt those Champions two, Her fond inconstant will: For after that the Castels foure Of Galleis both, with sound, And slaughter huge, their Bullets had In other made rebound, And all the small Artillerie Consumde their shots below In killing men, or els to cut Some Cable strong or Towe: Yet victorie still vncertaine was, And Soldats neuer ceast (With interchange of Pikes and Darts.) To kill, or wound at least. In end, when they with blood abroad Had bought their meeting deare, The victorie first on Spanish side Began for to appeare: For euen the Spanish Prince himselfe Did hazard at the last, Accompanied with boldest men, Who followd on him fast, By force to winne the Turkquish decke, The which he did obtaine, And entered in their Galley syne But did not long remaine: For ALI-BASHA proou'd so well, With his assisters braue, That backward faster then they came Their valiant foes they draue, That glad they were to skape themselues, And leaue behind anew Of valiant fellowes carcases, Whom thus their enemies slew. The Generall boldned then with spite, And vernisht red with shame, Did rather chuse to leese his life Then tine his spreading fame: And so of new encouraged His Souldiers true and bolde, As now for eigrenesse they burne Who earst were waxed colde: And thus they entred in againe More fiercelie then before, Whose rude assault could ALI then Resist not anie more, But fled vnto the forte at STEVIN For last refuge of all, Abiding in a doubtsome feare The chance he did befall. A MACEDONIAN souldier then Great honour for to win, Before the rest in earnest hope To BASHA bold did rin, And with a Cutlace sharpe and fyne Did whip mee off his head, Who lackt not his reward of him That did the Nauie lead: The Generall syne caus'd fixe the head Vpon his Galley Mast. At sight whereof, the faithlesse Host Were all so sore agast, That all amas'd gaue backe at once, But yet were staid againe, And neuer one at all did scape, But taken were or slaine, OCHIALI except, with three times ten Great Galleis of his owne, And many of the Knights of MALT Whome he had ouerthrowne: But if that he with his conuoy Had mist a safe retreat, No newes had SELYM but by brute heard euer of this defeat. WHEN thus the victorie was obteind, And thankes were giuen to God, Twelue thousand Christians counted were Releeu'd from Turquish rod. O Spanish Prince whome of a glance And suddainlie away The cruell fates gaue to the world Not suffering thee to stay. With this the still night sad and blacke The earth ouer shadowed then, Who MORPHEVS brought with her and rest To steale on beasts and men. BVT all this time was Venice Towne Reuoluing what euent Might come of this prepared fight, With doubtsome mindes and bent: They long'd, and yet they durst not long To heare the newes of all, They hoped good, they feard the euill, And kest what might befall: At last the joyfull tidings came, Which such a gladnes bred, That Matrons graue, and Maids modest, The Market place bespred: Anone with chearefull countenance They dresse them in a ring, And thus the formest did begin Syne all the rest to sing. CHORVS VENETVS. Sing praise to God both young and olde That in this towne remaine, With voice, and euerie Instrument, Found out by mortall braine: Sing praises to our mightie God, Praise our deliuerars name, Our louing Lord, who now in need, Hath kythd to be the same. The faithles snares did compasse vs, Their netts were set about, But yet our dearest Father in Heauen, He hath redeemd vs out. Not onlie that, but by his power, Our enemies feet they slaid, Whome he hath trapt, and made to fall Into the pit they made: Sing praises then both young and olde, That in this towne remaine, To him that hath releeued our necks, From Turquish yoak prophaine. Let vs wash off our sinnes impure, Cast off our garments vile, And hant his Temple euerie day, To praise his name a while. O praise him for the victorie, That he hath made vs haue, For he it was reuengd our cause, And not our armie braue: Praise him with Trumpet, Piphre, and drumme, With Lutes, and Organes fine, With Viols, Gitterns, Cistiers als, And sweetest voices syne: Sing praise, sing praise both young and olde, Sing praises one and all, To him who hath redeemd vs now, From cruell Pagans thrall. IN HEARING of this song mee thinks My members waxes faint, Nor yet from dulnes can I keepe, My minde by no restraint. But lo my Yrnie head doth nod, Vpon my Adamant brest, My eie-lidds will stand vp no more, But falles to take them rest. And through my weak and wearie hand, Doth slide my pen of lead, And sleep doth els possesse mee all, The similitude of dead. The God with golden wings through ports, Of horne doth to me creepe, Who changes ofter shapes transformd Then PROTEVS in the deepe. How soone he came, quite from my minde, He worldlie cares remou'd, And all my members in my bed, Lay still in rest beloud. And syne I heard a joifull song Of all the fethered bands Of holie Angels in the heauen, Thus singing on all hands. CHORVS ANGELORVM. Sing let vs sing with one accord HALLELV-IAH on hie, With euery elder that doth bow Before the Lambe his knee: Sing foure and twentie all with vs Whill Heauen and earth resound Replenisht with IEHOVAS praise Whose like cannot be found: For he it is, that is, and was, And euermore shall be, One onelie one vnseparate, And yet in persons three. Praise him for that he creat hath The Heauen, the earth and all, And euer hath preseru'd them since From their ruine and fall: But praise him more if more can be, That so he loues his name, As he doth mercie shew to all That doe professe the same: And not alanerlie to them Professing it aright, But euen to them that mixe therewith Their owne inuentions slight: As specially this samin time Most plainlie may appeare, In giuing them such victorie That not aright him feare: For since he shewes such grace to them That thinks themselues are just, What will he more to them that in His mercies onelie trust? And sith that so he vses them That doubt for to be sau'd, How much more them that in their hearts His promise haue engrau'd? And since he doth such fauour shew To them that fondlie pray To other Mediatours then Can helpe them any way: O how then will he fauour them, Who praiers do direct Vnto the Lambe, whome onely he Ordaind for that effect? And since he doth reuenge their cause That worship God of bread, (An errour vaine the which is bred, But in a mortall head) Then how will he reuenge their cause That onelie feare and serue, His dearest Sonne, and for his sake Will for no perrils swerue: And since that so he pities them That beare vpon their brow, That marke of Antichrist the whoore That great abuser now, Who does the truest Christians With fire and sworde inuade And make them holie Martyrs that Their trust in God haue laid, How will he them that thus are vsde, And beares vpon their face His speciall marke, a certaine signe Of euerlasting grace? Put end vnto the traueils (Lord) And miseries of thy Sancts, Remouing quite this blindnes grosse That now the world so dants: Sing praises of his mercie then His superexcellence great, Which doth exceed euen all his works That lie before his seat: And let vs sing both now and ay To him with one accord, O holie, holie, God of Hosts, Thou euerliuing Lord. THVS ended was the Angels song, And also heere I end: Exhorting all you Christians true Your courage vp to bend, And since by this defeat ye see, That God doth loue his name So well, that so he did them aid That seru'd not right the same. Then though the Antichristian sect Against you do conjure, He doth the bodie better loue Then shadow be ye sure: Do ye resist with confidence, That God shall be your stay And turne it to your comfort, and His glorie now and ay. FINIS. SONET. [The azur'd vaulte, the crystall circles bright] The azur'd vaulte, the crystall circles bright, The gleaming fyrie torches powdred there, The changing round, the shyning beamie light, The sad and bearded fyres, the monsters faire: The prodiges appearing in the aire, The rearding thunders, and the blustering winds, The foules, in hew, in shape, in nature raire, The prettie notes that wing'd musiciens finds: In earth the sau'rie floures, the mettal'd minds, The wholesome hearbes, the hautie pleasant trees, The syluer streames, the beasts of sundrie kinds, The bounded roares and fishes of the seas: All these, for teaching man, the LORD did frame, To do his will, whose glorie shines in thame.

O womans witt that wauers with the winde When none so well may warie now as I As weathercocke thy stablenes I finde And as the sea that still can neuer lie Bot since that tyme the trueth hath made me trie That in inconstance thou art constant still My courage sayes on Cupide ceasse to crie That are rewarded thus for thy goodwill For thogh Madame I failde not to fullfill All sort of seruice to a Mistres dewe Yett absence thogh bot for a space did spill The thankes deserued of all my seruice trewe What shall I saye, I neuer thought to see That out of sight, shoulde out of langour be. 6 Constant Loue in all Conditions Now doeth disdainfull Saturne sadd and olde With ycie bearde enioye his frosen raigne His hoarie haires and snowie mantle colde Ou'rcouers hills and euerie pleasant plaine Whiles deaz'd with frost, whiles droun'd with rapping raine Doe beasts and birds bewaile there carefull cace With longsume lookes in houpe to see againe Sweete sauoured Flora showe her aimeled face. And looke how long they are in this estate, This dolent season so there courage dants That now no Cupide with his golden bate Darr make there harts his harbour where he hants Bot rather deade as are the trees and plants, There spirits of life must hide them at the hart Wherethrough there kindlie courage daylie scants Whill mounting Phœbus make them to reuert. And shall I then like birde or beast forgett For anie stormes that threatning heauen can send That obiect sweete, wheron my hart is sett Whome for to serue my senses all I bend My inward flame with colde it dothe contend The more it burnes, the more restrain'd it be No winters frost, nor sommers heate can end Or staye the course of constant loue in me 7 A Dier at her M:???? desyer If mourning might amend my harde vnhappie cace Or if complaining coulde appease Dame Fortunes frowning face Then shoulde I neuer cease by songs and sonnets still With my to iust conceaued regraits the earthe and aire to fill My cairfull cries and grones shoulde make the rockes rebounde The montains riue and all the earth with Echoes to resounde No Orpheus charming notes for his departed wife Nor raging Roland for his loue that ledd so madd a life No not the worlde in one compared should neuer be Vnto the mone that I shoulde make, suche passions martyrs me Bot what can that awaile except for to renewe My olde and deeplie rooted griefs that els to gladlie grewe To rankle wp the sore that lurkes into my hart And as a cancer make it spreade abroade in euerie part. What wrathe haue all the Gods conceaued at me allace That makes me loue where hatred dwells, and pittie hath no place Ô if she were bot faire, or if she were bot false Bot faire and false torments me thus and holdes me by the halse If beautie as it ought with bountie coupled ware Then suirlie she wolde pittie take on my consuming caire Or if she wear but false and lacking Venus grace Then woulde I not haue bene abused by her enchanting face Thus am I tortured still, I mourne without remeade My languour lackes one graine of houpe to mixe with daylie dreade My teares getts no regarde, my sighs can haue no eare And in one houre is quite forgott my seruice manie a yeare What houpe can rest behinde, what may I looke for then Bot be a butt to heauenlie plagues, a monstre amongs men My state can neuer change my griefs are bot begunne Thus casten is my luckles lott that woefull weirds haue spunne Awaye with comfort then and wellcome colde dispaire And since I can haue no delight, lett me delight in caire My mirth in murning be, my ioye in dolours deepe I will with sadd and sorie sighs my selfe from languour keepe And for my cheefest sports to minde then will I bring syne As in a roll my whole mishaps, then like a swanne them sing My houpe is whole transformed in blacke and colde dispaire Except I onlie houpe for deathe to end continuall caire: No, death he must not haste, my mischiefs woulde he mend It best becumes my miserie to duine before I end Yett if the endles smart and sorrowe I sustaine Were suffered for sume worthie wight, I happie wolde remaine I wolde me happie thinke if thus I martyred ware For sume sweete Sainct in sacrifice that both were good and faire Bot ô allace my paine and restles griefe it growes For her who neuer once on me a louing thought bestowes Yett lett not this dishart no happie man in loue that Who finds a maike that will not change, nor for no chance remoue. All wemen are in ouers, in vertue sume excell And sume in vices may ou'rmatche the greatest Diuell in hell The blessedest creatures made by God the Angells ware The cursedest creatures in the worlde the fallen Angells are For me I onlie craue a spectacle to be Wherin as in á masse confused all miseries men may see And when my happ shall be to goe to wished graue Which is the onelie happie chance I euer wishe to haue That then the passenger may reade in going by For true and honest constant loue, this patient here does lye. the sonnett lakkis heere quhiche interprettis all the matter My Muse hath made a willfull lye I grante, I sung of sorrows neuer felt by me; I haue as great occasion for to wante, My loue begunne my blessing for to be. How can I then excuse so lowd a lye? O yes, I did it euen at her desire, Who made me such successe in loue to see, How soone her flames hade sett my hart on fire. Since for her sake I presse for to aspire, To preache of passions which I neuer prou'd; What should yee doe who haue for haplesse hire The lucklesse lott, to loue and not be lou'd. Your plaints I thinke should pierce the starrie skies And deaue the Gods with shrill and cairfull cries: 8 A complaint of his mistressis absence from Court Whill as a statelie fleeting castle faire On smoothe and glassie salt does softlie slide With snowie sheets all flaffing here and thaire So deck'd and trim'd as she were Neptunes bride And no ways troubled with contrarious tide And shining Titan from his firie cart Smiles seing nature triumph'd of by art. And whill the foolish pilgrims of the seas Inflam'd with following fortunes fickle baite Esteemes them selfs to be at such an ease. As who bot they into there owen concaite And euerie man sturrs wp his fellow maite As citiezens of Thetis sliprie grounde And sonnes to Phœbus lightner of this rounde. Thus whill they thinke there fortune frames at will The Sunne his beames aboundantlie bestowes Wpon the aire to make it cleare and still The sea so calme as scarcelie ebbs or flowes No messager of prison'd Æole blowes Except a gaile with breathing to and fra To stoppe the saile from rashing on the ray. Then if a cloude the sonne of vapours grosse Eclipse the Sunne from there astonish'd sight There cause of ioye becumes there cause of losse. For looke how soone they lacke there former light In place of Phœbus cumes a darckned night And drumlie cloudes with rumbling thunders rearde Doe threaten mixing heauens with sea and earde. O miserable wretches woulde they crie Who setled trust on so vnsetled grounde Who woulde all other elements defie For that which onelie is vnconstant founde Now were we happie, now into a stounde Are we ou'rladen with a hell of frayes Bot warre the rockes, soone cast her in the stayes O heauenlie lampe Apollo bright and cleare What crime hath so incenst thy heauenlie ire For as thy presence made ws heauenlie here Our light, our ioye, our comfortable fire Now loathe we that which most we did desire Since by thy absence heauen in hell is changed And we as Diuells in Plutoes court are ranged. The like, ô not the like bot like and more Doe we not one bot all in Court sustaine Since she who did our Princelie Court decore is absent, absent doth allace remaine Whose comelie beautie graced our Princelie traine Whose modest mirth express'd alluring grace Whose absence makes ws lacke our light allace. The Court as garland lackes the cheefest floure The Court a chatton toome that lackes her stone The Court is like a volier at this houre Wherout of is her sweetest Sirene gone. Then shall we lacke our cheefest onlie one? No, pull not from ws cruell cloude I praye Our light, our rose, our gemme, our bird awaye. Bot houpe beginnes to hoise me on her wings Euen houpe that presence absence shall amend. Bot what my Muse, how pertlie thus thou sings Who rather ought Solsequium like attend With luckned leaues till wearie night take end. Haste golden Titan thy so long'd returne To cleare the skies where now we darckned murne. 9 A dreame on his Mistris my Ladie Glammis Whill as the silent shaddie night Did with her courtens blacke Ou'rcouer Rheas fruictfull face And being colde and wacke By sympathie with mortall braines Our members make of leade And stealing all our senses make Ws lye a while as deade. Then whill I was in this estate The God with golden wings, Who entring at the ports of horne So manie monstres brings, And changing into sundrie shapes By strange and subtle slight, Does make ws heare without our eares And see but eyes or light. This strange and subtle God, I saye, Of late appear'd to me, And by the hand my Mistres ledd, Loe here she is quoth he, Whose presence breeds as manie ioyes As absence breeds thee woes, Loe here the harbour of thy hart Loe here thy onlie chose Loe here she is who makes thee trade The statelie forcked hill, Whose pleasant grasse beginnes to fade So trampled by thee still, Loe here she is who makes thee drinke The christall siluer spring Of flying horse and riding foule As ancient Poëts sing, Loe here the subiect and the wings Of thy high flying verse That mountes aboue the flammie vaults And to the heauen does pearse. With this me thought she bowed her doune And ioyned the rubies sine, (That hides her iuorie rankes and smells Of Nectar) vnto mine, Sine with her soft and silken hands About my necke she layes A tablet and an Amethyst And silent slipps her wayes. Bot loe my minde so passion'd was My hart so sturr'd withall With ioye extreame, as made them soone My senses to recall. And looke how soone from slugglish sleepe I perfectlie awooke, Euen at the first (ô miracle) Into my hand I tooke These tokens hunge about my necke (As I hade dream'd before) What Deïtie (quoth I amaz'd) For this shall I adore: Sume God or Angell suirlie hath This present to me brought, For if on anie naturall dreames Hade rauished bene my thought, Then ather of the humours foure The cheefe that did abounde, By sympathie with brethren foure Wherof was form'd this rounde, And with the seasons of the yeare Wolde vexed haue my braine, If bloode domin'd with bloodie iarres In spring tyme, and againe, If cholere raign'd with rauening fires In Sommers pearching heate, If phlegme did with drowning floods When Hyades holds there seate, If melancholie earth and night With heauie things and blacke, When frozen Saturne rules with snowe The place wolde suirlie take: Or els the things I last hade thought Hade done or wish'd to be They hade although imperfectlie In dreame appear'd to me, And so by nature hade I dream'd The thing I dream'd indeede, For I confesse that Idee oft My rauish'd minde dois feede, Bot then how soone I hade awack'd And Morpheus flowen awaye, No token hade he left behinde As now this wedd it laye: Then counting it sume heauenlie gift And sent me from aboue, I cust me narrowlie to guesse What coulde the meaning proue, And so beganne both wp and doune To tosse, to wiewe, to spie— The tablet and the Amethyst There secrets for to trie. Thou Lycian Lord that Deïtie Whome Delphos did adore, Whose shining coache doe saphirs blewe And rubies red decore, The sacred Sisters Monarch greate, The spirit that did inspire With oracles the Sybills sage Inflam'd with heauenlie fire, O thou that mysteries can reueale And future things foreseis Assist my seeking out of this And open cleare mine eyes. The Amethyst in forme of hart Doeth signifie the hart And constant loue vnchangeable That is vpon my part, And as the colours of this stone Are purple mix'd with graye, So flames of loue my earthlie parts Consumes me day by daye. The secret vertues that are hidd Into this pretious stone Indues me with meete qualities For seruing such a one. For as this stone by secret force Can soueraignlie remeade These daizeled braines whome Bacchus strength Ou'rcomes as they were deade, And can preserue ws from the harme Of the envenomed sting Of poysoned cuppes, that to our tombe Vntymelie does ws bring, So shall my harte be still preserued By vertue from aboue, From staggering like a drunken man Or wauering into loue: Bot by this soueraigne antidote Of her whome still I serue In spite of all the poysoned lookes Of Dames I shall not swerue. And speciallie with courage bolde This stone can furnish me That with my conquering hand I may Enforce my foes to flie, For suire he can not worthie be To be accompted deare By anie Dame that in his brest A womans hart dois beare. And therfor for my part I wowe If as the rumours be Of iarrs and broyles, I happen in Effect the same to see, I shall not from the enemies sight To anie part remoue, Vnkithing once in honour of My Mistres and my loue: But onlie mot I conquered be And onelie will I yeelde To Cupids shott, whose firie darts Resist coulde neuer sheelde. And lastlie as this stone hath force A hunter for to aide, In end to catche his pray, the fruict Of all his trauell made, So as I am an prentise past Into that Princelie game, Whose hounds and horns through rockes and woodes Makes Echo answer them, I trust by vertue of this stone To winne and holde the pray That prayes on me, and is of all My passion'd thoughts the stay. Bot loe I long to turne me to The tablet made of golde, And all without and in the same At length for to beholde. Of purest golde the tablet made Which by the fire is fin'd, Her chastnes pure does represent In bodie both and mind, The crawling scores of ameling blacke That on the golde are wrought, The diuers passions represents That walters in her thought. One of the leaues on vtter side A nacked man does beare, Whome Phœbus rosts with hote reflexe And stinging flees doe teare, Yett sitting in the forrest greene, As senceles of his harme, By harmonie of violl sweete He neuer irkes to charme The rauish'd foules and beasts about, Esteeming so there ioye, As makes him quite for to forgett His grieuous sore anoye. This man not onlie represents Her Siren voyce diuine, Wherewith she makes the dullest eares And hardest harts encline, Bot as his dittie sayes, To please The rest he suffers paine, So she her Princesse serues of loue Without respect of gaine. The other on the vtter side The Sunne hath shining bright Into the midst, with stars about Bot darckned by his light And as that dittie sayes, As Sunne Amongst the stars does shine, So she her sexe surpasseth far In vertues most diuine: That Sunne of whome I sung before Whose absence made me flie Aboue the skies, ô Sunne to seeke Her shaddowe into the. Bot if into these former verse I soar'd with Eagle wings, Then Mistres thanke your selfe for them That by your vertue sings. Bot greatest comfort is to me To spie the inward part, Wheras ane hand does holde me thinke My onelie Mistres hart, Whill Cupide with his bended bowe And golden arrowe aime, To shoote his subtle firie shaft For pearcing of the same: Bot that her hand does holde her hart I take it for to be, That willinglie she letts her hart Be shotte into for me. The inward of the other leafe It emptie does remaine, Which if my guesse deceaue me not, Is ordain'd to containe, The art of sume Apelles fine, The portraict of her face, To giue vnto the workemanship Of all the rest a grace: For as the rest does represent Her qualities most rare, So shoulde her selfe, though viuelie, no, Yett best it can be there. And suire the Gods aboue they haue Decreed as seemes to me, That as the tablet and the stone Both knitt together be Euen by a string, the tablet like To her, to me the stone, So shall our loue whill Atrope cutt The threed, be knitt in one. Thus haue I redd my dreame ye see With wise Apollos aide, And if this be the verrie trueth That I herin haue saide, Then am I gladd of such a guesse, Bot if I be deceau'd, And in the opening of a dreame Haue ather dream'd or reau'd, Yett wellcume be a gladd deceate, For as into my sleepe, My dreame deceaued me, so my guesse, In gladnes doth me keepe. Now may ye see ô Titan mine, No distance far of place, Nor other thoughts can out of me The thought of yow deface, In absence are ye present still And euer so in sight, No wonder is, what Monarch may Resist a womans might. 10 A Satire against Woemen As falcons are by nature faire of flight Of kinde as sparhalks far excells in speede As marlions haue in springing greatest might As gosehalks are of nature giuen to greede As mauises of kinde are giuen to sing And laurocks after candlemasse to spring. As piots steales what euer they can beare Of kinde as corbies followes carions vilde As ieas will conterfitt what sounde they heare As gledds of nature kills not oft the wylde As crowes and kaes will clatter when they playe As hens of nature keckells when they laye. As kinde makes hounds to followe hairs by sent As cursours nickers riding in the night As lions for to seeke there praye are bent As beares by kinde, of leggs are wonderous wight As tigres flies the waters and the wites As nature giues the Ounces cruell sprites. As goates delights to climbe through craige and cleughe As deere of nature hants the forrest faire As conns by kinde will skippe from branche to beughe As foxes can by craft escaipe the snaire As brockes in winter likes to sleepe and rest As swine by nature loues the midding best. As schooles of herring flees the whaill for feare As greate olde pyckes will eate the young and small As remora will stoppe a shippe to steare As kinde makes sea horse to be cruell all As kinde makes creuises to swimme abacke As troutes of nature fishers baits will take. As marmaides hates all men by natures will As delphins loues all bairns in wonderous sorte As by the contrare crocodills them kill As mareswines loues of nature for to sporte Of kinde as salmon in freshe water spawnes As selchs haue milke and young ons lacking rawnes. In short as foules by kinde in aire doe flee And as the beasts by nature goes on grounde And as the fishes swimmes in frothie see And as all liuing things are euer bounde To followe nature ruling them allwaye Whose will obeye they must butt lett or staye. Euen so all wemen are of nature vaine And can not keepe no secrett vnreuealed And where as once they doe concaiue disdaine They are vnable to be reconcealed Fullfild with talke and clatters but respect And often tymes of small or none effect. Ambitious all without regarde or shame But anie measure giuen to greede of geare Desyring euer for to winne a name With flattering all that will them not forbeare Sume craft they haue, yett foolish are indeede With lying whiles esteeming best to speede Exposition Expone me right ye Dames of worthie fame Since for your honours I employed my caire For wemen bad hereby are lesse to blame For that they followe nature eueriewhaire And ye most worthie prayse, whose reason dants That nature, which into your sexe, so hants. 11 Song 1 What mortall man may liue but hart As I doe now suche is my cace For now the whole is from the part Deuided eache in diuers place The seas are now the barr Which makes ws distant farr That we may soone winne narr God graunte ws grace. Full manie causes suire I haue Which does augment my woe and caire Bot one more speciall nor the leaue When I doe thinke what ioye was thaire What gladnes and what greeting At our long wished meeting I can not well vnwiting My cheekis declare. And sine how we so soone were shedd And loste our long desired ioye O what mischance, I neuer redd That louers hade suche cause of noye For other louers vses The one to make excuses Of absence, thus abuses Them Venus boye. Bot we endure far greater skaith For onelie one of them hath paine Bot we alike are wounded baith And cairfull till we meete againe O absence cruell foe Why workes thou ws such woe And gars true louers so Far shedd remaine. Thou absence giues me cause to feare Lest she be harm'd by sume mischance Thou absence gars me greine to heare Some worde from her, thou gars me panse What waye for to eschewe These sorrowes which renewe And whiles I change my hewe Whiles falls in transe. Bot by the contrare I reioyes When I persaue we marrowes be In trouble, sorrowe and in noyes That is a thing which comforts me The prouerbe makes relation That likes in tribulation Is wretches consolation So now are we. Reioyce therfor my halfe in all Since honest causes be the staye, Of presence, houpe that meete we shall With greater gladnes on a daye I praye the Lord abone To send it till ws soone Farewell till that be done And after aye. 12 Song 2 When as the skillfull archer false Inflam'd and pearc'd by craftie arte Leanders hart and Heros als By his so firie golden darte Fra Cupide blinde assailde With bowe and shaft His will they neuer failde Such was his craft. And euer from that tyme agoe There loue to others neuer past Whill fortune was there mortall foe And made them perishe both at last The raging seas they war Twixt them a barr There cheefest toyle and caire To swimme so farr. Bot liker is my fortune raire Since seas diuydes ws not at all To Piramus and Thisbe faire Deuyded onlie by a wall Which in it hade a bore Wherethrough they spake Which of a chance before Dame fortune brake. The verrie like did ws befall As them of whome I shewe before We distant are by such a wall And often spacke by such a bore Whill enuie called a naile There through so strate As made our moyen faile To speake of late. MISCELLANEA. [13] Ad hoc creaturæ destinatæ sunt, vt in eis glorificetur Creator This sonnet is printed at the end of Lepanto:— The azured vault, the christall circles bright The gleaming firie torches poudered thair The changing rounde, the shining beamie light The sadd and bearded fires, the monsters faire The prodiges appearing in the aire The rearding thunders and the blustering windes The foules in hewe, in shape and nature rare The prettie notts that wing'd musiciens findes In earthe the sauourie flowres, the metall'd mindes The wholesome herbes, the hautie pleasant trees The siluer streames, the beasts of sundrie kindes The bounded roares, and fishes of the seas All these for teaching man the Lord did frame To honoure him whose glorie shines in them. 14 A sonnet on M? Pa. Adamsons paraphrase of Job In wandring wealth through burbling brookes and bewes Of tripping troupes and flocks on fertill grounde In cattell great of sundrie shapes and hewes With houues all whole, or in a parted rounde In fields fullfild with cornes by shearers bounde In heapes of golde, and ritches in all wayes As Job excelled all others might be founde Of Monarchs greate or Princes in his dayes So this translatour merites no lesse praise For gifts of sprit, then he for gifts of geare And God in grace hath giuen suche conterpaise As his translation to the worke is peere God did his gifts in him so wiselie mell Whose heauenlie wealth Jobs earthlie wealth doth tell. 15 A sonnet on Ticho Brahe That onlie essence who made all of noght Our great and mightie Lord the life of all When he in ordour euerie thing hade broght At the creating of this earthlie ball Then made he man at last. Thy raigne it shall Extend (quod Jehoua) in euerie cace Ouer all these breathing beasts that flatlie fall For humble hommage here before thy face He also pitch'd eache Planet in his place And made them rulers of the ruling Lord As heauenlie impes to gouerne bodies basse Be subtle and celestiall sweete accord Then greate is Ticho who by this his booke Commandement doth ouer these commanders brooke. Another on the same The glorious globe of heauenlie matter made Containing ten celestiall circles faire Where shining starres in glistring graithe arraide Most pleasantlie are poudered here and thair Where euerie planet hath his owen repaire And christall house, a whirling wheill in rounde Whose calme aspects or froward does declaire Gods minde to blisse great kingdomes or confounde Then if yow list to see on earthlie grounde There ordour, course, and influence appeare Looke Tichoes tooles, there finelie shall be founde Each planet dansing in his propre spheare There fires diuine into his house remaine Whome sommerlie his booke doth here containe. Another on the same What foolish Phaëton did presume in pride Yea more what great Apollo takes in hand Who does the course of glistring Phœbus guide Thou does performe that rules eache firie brand Then greater art thou then Apollo cleare As thy Vranias eldest fostre deare. 16 A sonnet on Du Bartas Since ye immortall sisters nine hath left All other countries lying far or neere To follow him who from yow all them reft And now hath caused your residence be here Who thogh a stranger, yett he lou'd so deere This realme and me, so as he spoil'd his awin (And all the brookes, the bankes and fontains cleere That be in it) of yow, as he hath shawin In this youre worke, then lett your breaths be blawin In recompense of this his willing minde On me, that then may with my penn be drawin His praise: who thogh him selfe be not inclin'd Nor presseth bot to touche the laurell tree Yett well he merites crown'd therwith to be. What heauen doth furnish thee such learned skill What heauenlie fire inspires thy furious sprite What foule bereaues thou for to painte at will Thy trauells greate, what booke giues floures most sweete Deck'd, holie, cleane, alone but matches meete Wise, loftie, learned, with good will florish'd faire Of penn, of brightnes, smell and skill compleete They wonder at thee in heauen, fire, earthe, and aire Great God who heares from heauen his cantiques raire And knowes thy harper, furie, pen, and floure Preserue him in his midrinke with thy caire But doubt his skill will change in heauen sume houre His soule in starre, his furie in fires most strange His pen in Phœnix, corps in floure shall change. O diuin du Bartas, disciple d'Vranie L'honneur de nostre temps, poëte du grand Dieu Tes saincts vers doux-coulants pleins de douce manie Distillés des hauts cieux volent de lieu en lieu Comme esclairs foudroyants du grand esprit tonnant Postillonent tonnants du leuant au ponant. SONNET [Since ye immortall sisters nine hes left] Since ye immortall sisters nine hes left All other countries lying farre or nere: To follovv him vvho from them all you reft, And novv hes causde your residence be here VVho though a straunger yet he lovde so dere This Realme and me, so as he spoilde his avvne, And all the brookes &amp; banks, &amp; fountains clere That be therein of you as he hath shavvne in this his vvork: then let your breath be blavvne, In recompence of this his vvilling minde On me: that sine may vvith my pen bee dravvne His praise: for though himselfe be not inclynde Nor preaseth but to touch the Laurer tre: Yet vvell he merits crovvnd thervvith to be. FINIS. 17 A Sonnet on M? W. Fullers translation of Petrarchs triumphe of loue We find by proofe that into euerie age In Phœbus art sume glistring starre did shine Who worthie schollers to the Muses sage Fullfil'd there countries with there workes diuine So Homere was a sounding trumpett fine Amongst the Greeks into his learned dayes So Virgill was amongst the Romanes sine A spirit sublimed, a piller of there praise So loftie Petrarch his renoume did blaze In toungue Italique in a sugred stile And to the circled skies his name did raise For he by poëms that he did compile In triumphe ledde loue, chastnes, deathe, and fame Bot thou triumphes ouer Petrarchs propre name. 18 An Epitaphe on S? Philip Sidney Thou mightie Mars the God of souldiours braue And thou Minerue that does in witt excell And thou Apollo that does knowledge haue Of euerie art that from Parnassus fell With all the Sisters that theron doe dwell Lament for him who dewlie seru'd yow all Whome in, yow wiselie all your arts did mell Bewaile I saye his vnexspected fall I neede not in remembrance for to call His youth, his race, the houpe hade of him aye Since that in him doeth cruell deathe appall Both manhoode, witt, and learning euerie waye Now in the bed of honour doeth he rest And euermore of him shall liue the best. Sonnet to the authoure. Drummond MSS. vol. i. We finde by prwif that into euerie aige In phœbus art sum glistring starr did shyne, Who, worthye Scollaris to the muses saige, Fulfild thair countreis with thair works dewyne: So Homer was a sounding trumpet fyne Amangst the Greikis into his learned dayes; So Virgill was amongst the Romans syne A spreit sublimed, a pillar of thair prayse; So loftye Petrark his renoun did blayse In tounge Italique in a sugred style, and to the circled skyes his name did rayse; For he by poems that he did compyle Led in Triumphe lowe, chaistnes, death, and fame; bot thow triumphs ouer PETRARCHS propper name. I. REX. IN PHILIPPI SIDNÆI interitum, Illustrissimi Scotorum Regis Carmen. ACADEMIAE CANTABRIGIENSIS LACHRYMAE, 1587. Thou mighty Mars the Lord of Souldiers brave, And thou, Minerve, that dois in wit excell, And thou Apollo who dois knowledge have, Of euery art that from Parnassus fell With all your Sisters that thaireon do dwell, Lament for him, who duelie serv'd you all Whome in you wisely all your arts did mell, Bewaile (I say) his inexspected fall, I neede not in remembrance for to call His race, his youth, the hope had of him ay Since that in him doth cruell death appall Both manhood, wit, and learning euery way, Bot yet he doth in bed of honor rest, And euermore of him shall liue the best. 19 An epitaphe on John Shaw A vertuous life procures a happie deathe And raires to loftie skies there noble name Then blest is he who looseth thus his breathe Though to his friends it be a griefe the same This may be saide of thy immortall fame Who here reposes closed in honours laire For as of trewe and noble race thou came So honestie and trueth was all thy caire Thy kinn was honoured by thy vertues raire Thy place of creditt did thy friends defend.

William Alexanders harshe vearses after the Inglishe fasone Hould hould your hand, hould, mercy, mercy, spare Those sacred nine that nurst you many a yeare Full oft alas with comfort and with care Wee bath'd you in Castalias fountaine cleare Then on our winges aloft wee did you beare And set you on our stately forked hill Where you our heaunly harmonyes did heare The rockes resoundinge with there Echoes still Although your neighbours haue conspir'd to spill That art which did the Laurel crowne obtaine And borowing from the raven there ragged quill Bewray there harsh hard trotting tumbling wayne Such hamringe hard the mettalls hard require Our songs ar fil'd with smoothly flowing fire 31 A Sonet against the could that was in January 1616 How cruely these catiffs doe conspire What loathsome loue breeds such a baleful band, Betwixt the cancred Kinge of Creta land That melancholy ould and angry syre And him who wont to quench debaite and ire Amongst the Romains when his ports were clos'd But now his double face is still dispos'd With Saturns helpe to freeze vs at the fire The earth or'e-couered with a sheete of snow Refuses foode to foule to bird and beast The chillinge cold letts every thing to grow And surfets cattil with a starving feast Curst bee that loue and may't continue short That kills all creaturs and doth spoile our sport. 32 [Not orientall Indus cristall streames] Not orientall Indus cristall streames; Nor frutfull Nilus, that no bankes can thole; Nor golden Tagus; wher bright Titans beam[e]s, Ar headlongst hurled, to vew the Antartike Pole; Nor Ladon (which sweet Sidney dothe extole) While it, th'Arcadian Beauties did embrace: All thease cannot, thee, nameless thee, controle; But, with good right, must rander &amp; giue place: For, whilst sweete she, voutsafest to show her face, And, with her presence, honnors thee ilke day; Thou slyding, seemest, to haue a slower pace, Against thy will, as if thou went away, And, loathe to leaue, the sight of such a one Thou still imparts, thy plaints, to euery stone. Faire famous Isle, where Agathocles rang; Where sometymes, statly Siracusa stood; Whos fertill feelds, were bathed in bangsters blood, When Rome, &amp; ryuall Carthage, straue so lang; Great Ladie Mistriss, all the Isles amang, Which stands in Neptunes, circle mouuing, flood; No, nather for thy frutefull ground nor good; I chuse the, for the subject of my sang; Nor, for the owld report, of scarce trew fame; Nor heeretofore, for farelies in the found; But, for the sweet resemblance of that Name, To whom thou seemest, so sibb, at least in sound; If then, for seeming so, thy prays bee such; Sweet she her selfe, dothe merit more then much. 33 Vpon occasion of some great disorders in Scotland.

For ye was cracking crouslie of your broune, If Robert lie not, all the other night That there was anie like him in this toune Wpon the grounde ye wolde not lett it light He was so firie speedie yaulde and wight For to be shorte he was an A per se Bot yett beleeue ye saw an other sight Or all was done (or Robins rithme does lie.

Bot to conclude the houre appointed came Ye made yow readie for to rinne the race Ye bracke togither, and ranne out the same, As Robin sayes, it hade bene fil'd your face It chanc'd ye were forerunne a prettie space A mile or more, that keeped it so cleene When all was done ye hade so euill a grace Ye stoll awaye and durst no more be seene.

True is that saying vs'd of olde amongs philosophes wise That to eschue his destinie in no mans hands it lies And thogh that they as ethnicks blinde on fortune laide the cause And on the course and influence of starres and of there lawes. Yett doe we Christians clearlie knowe that it is God alone Who did before beginnings all, on wordlie things dispone Euen he into his glorious and stedfast shining throne Hath giuen to euerie thing a tyme when as it must be done That thogh this statelie heauen we see, the seas, and solide grounde Must perish, and must changed be into a suddaine stounde Yett not a worde of his decrees shall euer fall in vaine Bot must be at that instant done, he did for it ordaine And so as I haue saide it does from Gods preordining flowe The certaintie of destinies, and not of starres does growe For they as simple creatures can no wayes guided be Except by him that creatt them, then iudge how like is he That can not stande nor rule him selfe, to guide so manie things Turne famous kingdomes wpside doune, make and vnmake there Kings Thus Ethnicks fonde thogh wordlie wise, not knowing anie God Did first inuent that fortune and the starres did rule the rod For like a blindman lacking light they wandered here and there By guesse with groaping, stumbling oft, bot knewe not how nor where And since sume Christians on there stepps Cimmerians hath no shame To take wpon them to debaite and putt in proofe the same. O soft and faire, redounding Muse returne into thy waye Thou chooses here to large a fielde, and to to far astraye And worse then that, thou are to weake a Momus to be bolde So manie learned men to impugne that this coniecture holde. Then to returne to destinies, how none can them eschue I may affirme that in my selfe, I proued it to be true For I as being a King by birth, it seam'd my lott was made thaire to resyde quhaire god my charge &amp; burthen on me laide And lacking parents, brethren, bairns, or anie neare of kinn Incace of death, or absence to supplie my place therin And cheeflie in so kitle a land, where few remember can For to haue seene gouerning there a King that was a man yett thogh through these occasions all, it was my setled minde That I shoulde neuer on vncouthe coastes a harberie seeke to finde: 39 A pairt of du Bartas first day This largeness and this breadth so long, / this highnes so profounde, This bounded infinite, the masse / confused of all this rounde; This Chaos lourde, I saye, which in / it selfe suche wproares wroght, And sawe it in one moment borne / in nothing made of noght, The brooddie bodie was wherof / the essence pure diuine, And foure contending brethren ought / there birth to borrowe sine, Now as to these foure elements, / these twinne sonnes ment by here, Towitt, the subtle aire, the fire, / the earthe, and waters cleere, Composed they are not, bot of them / is all composed and made, That can into our senses fall, / or may be thought or saide: Now if there qualities do poure / there whole effects within Eache part of euerie bodie mixed, / and so to worke beginne; Or whether that on euerie part / there beings they confounde And so of beings double twaine / one bodie doe compounde; Euen as within the bottome deepe / of christall glasses cleene, The wine with the Acheloian sucke / for to be mix'd is seene: Or euen as meate which wholesome is / and subtle liquour fine Doe mixe them selfs within ws for / to change in chilus sine. This by experience may we see / into the stick that burnes, Vnto the heauen his natiue house / his fire full swift returnes, His aire it flies in wanished smocke, / his earth in cendres falls, His water crackes into his knotts, / and as for succour calls. Like warre dothe holde our bod' in peace, / whose earth her fleshe it bene, Who does into her vitall spirits / her fire and aire contene, Her water in her humours lies: / yet thou can see no part In all our humaine bodie, where / eache one by naturall art Hath not his mightie vertues mix'd, / allthogh we plainlie see That ather one or other of them / the cheefe commander be. Into the masse of seething bloode / this clayie dregg and thicke, Is blacke melancholie which sadd / does to the bottome sticke, Composed of earthlie substance grosse; / in bloode the aire abides, Which pure into the mids doe swimme; / the humour in the sides It is the colde and wattrie phlegme; / this foame that light does flote And holds the selfe aloft, it is / the burning cholere hote. I meane not that eache element / into his hands retaines The sceptre of one bodie aye, / his tyme about he raignes The subiect making for to stoupe / vnto his law and will, And als oft as his King is changed, / he changeth nature still: Euen as without respect of wealth, / of bloode or noble race, Eache worthie citizen commandes / a certaine tyme and space, In citties Democratick free, / that suddainlie appeare, Through changing of there magistrate / a changing face to beare: For people lightlie agitate / with diuers humours strange, Chameleon like with manners of / there rulers doe they change, Euen so the element that in / the wine as cheefe doeth raigne, Whiles makes it drie, whiles wacke, / whiles hoate and colde againe By there commixtions imperfect / or perfect in it plac'd Enforcing it to change as well / of vertue as of taste: So as by processe of the tyme / the veriusse bitter greene, Sweete winne becummes, then stronger wine, / sine winaigre it bene. Now euen as when a Prince or King / does ouer ws so commande, As vnderneath the yoake of law / he gars his greatnes stande; He rules without suspicion, and / the common wealth enioyes Most happilie a quiet state / without tyrannique toyes: Bot if that cruell Tyranne like / he neuer satiate be, With his good subiects saickles bloode, / and if his sworde doe flie To bloodie sharpe the scabert still, / his rage it will not spare In end to turne his ciuill land / in deserts wilde and bare. The like falls out when as one of / the elements empires, Ouer his three fellowes modestlie, / and not there wracke requires; And when as a proportion / affeirand ioynes we see The subiect humours with the cheefe, / though they vnequall be: The bod' in being then abides / and als it doth retaine, The speciall draughts of all his forme / which outwardlie remaine. Bot if that like vnto that King / who barb'rous did desire That all the citizens of his / most mightie great empire, Boore bot one craige that by that meanes / (ô crueltie) he might; By one greate blowe bereaue the liues / of all the Romans quitt. 40 The beginning of M? du Bartas Eden Thou mightie God, that of the worlde the birth did make me see Vnfolde her credle also now, her childehoode showe to me: And make my spirit to walke athort the turning florish'd wayes Of sauourie gardens, where into still crooked but anie stayes Of riuers foure the courses quicke: declare me what offence From Edens both, chas'd Adams selfe and seede for his pretense: And tell who of immortall did him selfe an mortall make, To bring from heauen the antidote to ws which we did take. Giue thou me grace the storie of the Church to sing aright, And als the storie of the Kings; and grante that by thy might I guide the worlde unto her graue, my purpose making leste Euen from the first of Sabboths all vnto the hinmest rest. Well knowe I that this surgie sea is lacking marche or grounde Bot ô thou holie pilote greate will guide me safe and sounde, Vnto the hauen of my desire, where droucked then I shall; Extoll thy mercies maniefolde and paye my uowes withall. O sacred floure du lis whose youth does promise to ws all, That euen thy famous laurells greene matche Alexanders shall; Since that for to obeye thy will I flie into the skies, Conuoye my course with louing eye, and helpe the faults rise From my to blounted fruictles pen; in Pampelone so sume daye Maye thou winne home thy croune againe the which was reft awaye: So of thy neighbours euermore may thou the honour be, The loue of all thy subiects true, and foes to feare for the: So neuer may the heauen against the showe his wrathefull face, Bot the Eternall be thy arme, his Spirit thy guiding trace; So with my shearing sworde in hand and fighting at thy side May I ou'rclothed with bloode and stoure so boldlie by the bide, As for to cleaue the Spaignoll hoaste, or force sume seaged toune The combatt done for Virgill serue to publish thy renoune. God did not onlie (Soueraigne Prince) the whole command bestowe On our forefather Adam of this earthe and all belowe In making subiect to his yoake the scalie swimming race, Who with there litle finns doe cleaue the froathie seas apace; And these that haue no other holde bot horrour of deserts And these that bricole through the vaste of aire that feathers partis: Bot choosed him als an dwelling place which happie was and more, With climat temperate and faire, the which the dentie Flore With variant ameling paimented Did payment with the aimeling. faire. of springing floures most sweete, Adorned with Pomones fruicts, and als with Zephyrs smells repleete: Where God him selfe did lauell iust the alles with his line, Ou'rcouer all the hills with trees, with haruest the vallies sine; And with the sounde of thousand brookes adiourned the sweetest sleepe; Made cabinets faire at proofe of Sunne which out his beames did keepe, He squar'd a garden, and als he did plante, cleange, and labour sine The euerliuing fairenesse of an fertle orchard fine: The sacred riuers courses als he parted here and there, And with a thousand coulours peints the face of meddowes faire.

THE ARGVMENT (of the booke.) SONNET. JAMES VI, ????????? ????? 1599. God giues not Kings the style of Gods in vaine, For on his throne his Scepter do they swey: And as their subiects ought them to obey, So Kings should feare and serue their God againe. If then ye would enioy a happie raigne, Obserue the Statutes of your Heauenly King; And from his Lawe, make all your Lawes to spring: Since his Lieutenant heare ye should remaine, Reward the iust, be steadfast, true, and plaine: Represse the proud, maintaining ay the right, Walke alwaies so, as euer in his sight Who guardes the godly, plaging the prophane, And so ye shall in princely vertues shine. Resembling right your mighty King diuine. IX 1604. Sonnet of his Majesty. Full many ane tyme the archier slakkis his bow That afterhend it may the stronger be: Full many ane time in Vulkane's burning stow The Smith does water cast with careful ee. Full oft contentions great arise we see Betwixt the husband and his loving wife That sine they may the fermlyer agree When ended is that sudden choler strife. Yea, brethern, loving vther as their lyfe Will have debates at certain tymes and hours. The wingèd boy dissensions hot and rife 'Twixt his lets fall like sudden summer showers. Even so this couldnes did betwixt us fall To kindle our love as sure I hope it shall. Finis J.R. Xa King James on the blazeing starr: Octo: 28: 1618 MS. RAWLINSON POET. 84 You men of Britaine, wherefore gaze yee so Vppon an Angry starr, which as yee know The sun shall turne to darknesse, the Moon to blood And then twill be to late for to turne good O be so happy then while time doth last As to remember Dooms day is not past And misinterpret not with vaine Conceit The Caracter you see on Heauen gate. Which though it bring the world some news fro fate The letters such as no man can translate And for to guesse at God Almightys minde Weere such a thing might cozen all mankinde Wherfore I wish the Curious man to keep His rash Imaginations till he sleepe Then let him dreame of ffamine plague and war And thinke the match with spaine hath causd this star Or let them thinke that if their Prince my Minion Will shortly chang, or which is worse religion And that he may haue nothing elce to feare Let him walke Pauls, and meet the Devills there And if he be a Puritan, and scapes Jesuites, salute him in their proper shapes These Jealousys I would not haue a Treason In him whose ffancy overrules his Reason Yet to be sure It did no harme, Twere fit He would be bold to pray for no more witt But onely to Conceale his dreame, for there Be those that will beleiue what he darrs feare. XIa On the death of Queene Anne MS. HARLEY 6917 Thee to inuite the great God sent a starre, whose friends and neerest kinne good princes are; for though they runne the race of man and dye, death seemes but to refine their maiesty; so did our Queene from hence her court remoue, and leaue the Earth to be enthroned aboue; then she is changed not dead, noe good prince dyes, but only like the sunne doth sett to rise. XII To the Duke of Buckingham MS. EGERTON 2725 Now let us [all] reioice sing Peans all For Buckingham is now made Admirall And he that rules the horse our strenght by land Our strenght by sea the Navy doth command: Soe in the heauenly Courte that selfe same God Neptune I meane that with his three tooth'd Rod Brought forth the horse doth with the same appease The raging fury of the boysterous seas. Why then should any grudge that favour graces The meritt of one person with two places Since it is soe amongst the states of heaven Where none dare doubt but things are carried even. Jacobus Rex. XIII Verses made by the Kinge, when hee was entertaynd at Burly in Rutland-shire, by my L. Marquesse of Buckingham. August: 1621 MS. RAWLINSON POET. 26 The heauens that wept perpetually before, Since wee came hither show theyr smilinge cleere. This goodly house it smiles, and all this store Of huge prouision smiles vpon vs heere. The Buckes &amp; Stagges in fatt they seeme to smile: God send a smilinge boy within a while. Votum A Vow or Wish for the felicity &amp; fertility of the owners of this house. If euer in the Aprill of my dayes I satt vpon Parnassus forked hill: And there inflam'd with sacred fury still By pen proclaim'd our great Apollo's praise: Grant glistringe Phoebus with thy golden rayes My earnest wish which I present thee heere: Beholdinge of this blessed couple deere, Whose vertues pure no pen can duly blaze. Thow by whose heat the trees in fruit abound Blesse them with fruit delicious sweet &amp; fayre, That may succeed them in theyr vertues rare. ffirme plant them in theyr natiue soyle &amp; ground.

Come Counsell me when I shall call Before bewarr what may befall Kings will hardly take aduice Of Counsell they are wondrous nice Loue and wisdome leads them still Their Counsell tables vpp to fill They need noe helpers in their choice Their best aduice is their owne voyce And be assured such are kings As they vnto their Counsell brings Which allwaies soe compounded are As some would make and some would marr. If I once bend my angrie browe Your ruyne comes though not as nowe ffor slowe I am reuenge to take; And your Amendments wroth will slake Then hold your pratling spare your penn Bee honest and obedient men Vrge not my Iustice I am sloe To giue yow your deserued woe.
