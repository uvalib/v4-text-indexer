To dyspyse poore folke is not my appetite Nor suche as lyue/of veray almesdede But myn intent is onely for to wryte The mysery of suche as lyue in nede And all theyr lyfe in ydlenesse dooth lede Wherby dooth sue suche inc?uenyence That they must ende in meschaunt indygence Chryst in this worlde ryght pouerte dyde sue Gyuyng vs example to folowe that degre Sayng/beati pauperes spiritu Beati mites/beati mundo corde Blyssed be they that poore in spyryte be And ben clene in herte/and meke therwith all For they shall possede the realme celestyall They be not poore that haue necessyte Except therwith they ben ryght well content Nor they be not ryche that haue grete plente If that they thynke that they haue competent And euer pleased with that god hath them sent For surely it is our lordes ordynaunce That eche sholde be pleased with suffysaunce That man that hath more than suffycyent With goodes at wyll/and dayly dyth encrease And euer is bare/hungry and indygent Scrapynge/and snudgynge/without ony cease Euer coueytynge the mynde hath no pease But lyueth by rapyne and vsury And careth not how he cometh therby Eke in dystres/doyng no benyfyte Letyng the poore/dye in great mysery His neyghbour in pryson/dooth not vysyte Nor yet forgyue/small parcell of duety Wery traueylers/in the stretes let ly The deed bodyes/without ony buryall His goodes/his god/a man may full well call Of suche ryche men recyteth the gospell Makyng lykenes of impossybylyte Sayeng that more casyly a great Camell May passe and go through a nedyls eye Than a ryche man in heuen for to be For who so mys vseth that god hath hym sent with cursed Diues in hell shalbe brent. These trew?t beggers begging fro place to place Nor yet these nedy of all maner facyon These apprentyces that do re?e from all grace These hyred seruaunts that kepe no condycion Nor all that feyne parfyt deuocyon Nor many other lyuyng in nede couert Though they lacke good/be not poore of hert. Se ye not dayly of all maner estate How in the lawe they trauers and coniect How neyghbours do fall at anger and debate Twene man wyfe eke the lyfe imperfect The father and chyld/from quyetnes abiect And all for good/they make eche other smart Which is a sygne they be not poore of hart. If that our prynce do aske a subsedy From our ennemyes vs to defend Or yf our credytours demaund theyr duety To confesse pouerte than we do pretend But yf our neyghbour in ought vs offend Than we fynd money to play ouerthwart Which is a token we be not poore at hart How many poore that haue lytell in store Is content/with his small substaunce But euer they grudge and wysh for more To be promoted and haue furtheraunce The very beggers for theyr pytaunce From bag and staffe are lothe for to depart Which is a token they be not poore at hart Of these two estates there be four degrees A ryche ryche, a poore poore/a ryche poore also A poore ryche in all necessytees The two can agre/but the other no A proud hert/a beggers purs therto The ryche purs/and the poore spyryt May well agre/and be in one parfyt. Exhortacion of the compyler. I pray all you, which haue ynough with grace For the loue of god, to do your charyte And fro the poore, neuer turne your face For Chryst sayth, what euer that he be That to the least of myne, dooth in the name of me Unto my self, I do accept the dede And for rewarde my realme they shall possede. Finis. Here begynneth the casualyte Of the entraunce into hospytalyte To wryte of Sol in his exaltacyon Of his solstyce or declynacyon Or in what sygne, planet, or degre As he in course is vsed for to be Scorpio, pisces, or sagyttary Or whan the moone her way dooth contrary Or her eclypse/her wane/or yet her full It were but lost/for blockysh braynes dull But playnly to say/euen as the tyme was About a fourtenyght after Halowmas I chaunced to come by a certayn spyttell Where I thought best to tary a lyttell And vnder the porche for to take socour To byde the passyng of a stormy shour For it had snowen and frosen very strong With great ysesycles on the eues long The sharp northwynd hurled bytterly And with blacke cloudes/darked was the sky Lyke as in wynter/some days be naturall With frost and rayne/and stormes ouer all So styll I stode/as chaunced to be The porter of the hous/stode also by me With whome I reasoned of many dyuers thynges Touchyng the cours of all suche wetherynges And as we talked/there gatered at the gate People as me thought/of very poore estate With bag and staf/both croked/lame/and blynde Scabby &amp; scuruy/pocke eaten flesh and rynde Lowsy and scalde/and pylled lyke as apes With scantly a rag/for to couer theyr shapes Brecheles/barefoted/all stynkyng with dyrt With .M. of tatters/drabblyng to the skyrt Boyes/gyrles/and luskysh strong knaues Dydderyng &amp; dadderyng/leaning on their staues Sayng good mayster/for your moders blyssyng Gyue vs a half peny/toward our lodgyng The porter sayd what nede you to craue That in the spyteell shall your lodgyng haue Ye shall be entreated/as ye ought to be For I am charged/that dayly to se The systers shall do theyr obseruaunce As of the hous is the due ordynaunce. Copland. Porter sayd I/gods blyssyng and our lady Haue ye for spekyng so curteysly To these poore folke/and god his soule pardon That for theyr sake/made this foundacyon But syr I pray you/do ye lodge them all That do aske lodgyng in this hospytall? Porter. Forsoth yea/we do all suche folke in take That do aske lodgyng for our lordes sake And in dede it is our custome and vse Somtyme to take in/and some to refuse. Copland. Than is it comyn to euery wyght How they lyue all day, to lye here at nyght Is losels/myghty beggers/and vacabonds And trewands that walke ouer the londs Mychers, hedgecrepers/fylloks and luskes That all the somer kepe dyches and buskes Lewtryng and wandryng fro place to place And wyll not work/but the bypaths trace And lyue with Haws, and hunt the blakbery And with hedge brekyng make themself mery But in the wynter they draw to the towne And wyll do nothyng/but go vp and down And all for lodgyng that they haue here by nyght Me thynk that therin ye do no ryght Nor all suche places of hospytalyte To confort people of suche iniquyte. But syr I pray you/of your goodnes and fauour Tell me which ye leaue/&amp; which ye do socour? For I haue sene at sondry hospytalles That many haue lyen dead without the walles And for lacke of socour haue dyed wretchedly Unto your foundacyon/I thynke contrary Moche people resorte here/and haue lodgyng But yet I maruell greatly of one thyng That in the nyght so many lodge without? For in the watche whan that we go about Under the stalles, in porches and in doores I wote not whither they be theues or hoores But surely euery nyght there is found One or other lyeng by the pound In the shepe cootes/or in the hey loft And at saynt Barthylmews chyrch doore full oft And euen here alway by this brycke wall we do them fynd, that do bothe chyde and brall And lyke as beastes/togyder they be throng Bothe lame and seke/and hole them among And in many corners where that we go wherof I wondre greatly why they do so But oftymes whan that they vs se They do re?e a great deale faster than we. Porter. Suche folkes be they that we do abiect We are not bound to haue to them aspect Those be mychers, that lyue in trewandyse, Hospytalyte dooth them alway despyse. Copland. Syr I pray you, who hath of you relefe? Porter. Forsoth they that be at suche myschefe That for theyr lyuyng can do no labour And haue no frendes to do them socour As old people/seke/and impotent Poore women in chyldbed haue here easement Weyke men sore wounded by great vyolence And sore men eaten with pockes and pestylence And honest folke fallen in great pouerte By myschaunce or other infyrmyte Way faryng men, and maymed souldyours Haue theyr relyef in this poore hous of ours And all other which we seme good and playne Haue here lodgyng for a nyght or twayne Bedred folke/and suche as can not craue In these places/moost relyef they haue And yf they hap/within our place to dye Than are they buryed/well and honestly But not euery vnseke stoborne knaue For than we shold ouer many haue. Copland. How say you by these comyn beggers that crye Dayly on the worlde/and in the hye wayes lye At westmynster/and at saynt Poules And in all stretes they syt as desolate soules Me thynke it it a very well done dede With deuocyon suche people to fede Porter. Where ony gyueth almesse with good entent The rewarde can not be no wyse mysspent Copland. Ye but syr I wyll not lye by my soule As I walked to the chyrche of saynt Poule There sate beggers: on eche syde the way two As is seen dayly, they be wont to do Syr one there was, a myghty stoburne slaue That for the other began to beg and craue Now mayster, in the way of your good spede To vs all four/behold where it is nede And make this farthyng worth a halfpeny For the fyue ioyes of our blyssed lady Now turne agayn for saynt Erasmus sake And on my bare knees here a vowe I make Our ladyes psalter thre tymes euen now Now turne agayn/as god shall turne to you Now mayster, do that no man dyd this day On yone poore wretch/that roteth in the way Now mayster for hym that dyed ontre Lete vs not dye for lacke of charyte Thus he prated/as he full well can Tyll at last an honest seruyng man Came by the way/and by compassyon Of his wordes/dyd his deuocyon Whan he was gone a lytell fro thens I sawe the begger pull out .xi. pens Sayeng to his felaws se what here is Many a knaue haue I called mayster for this Lete vs go dyne/this is a symple day My mayster therwith shall I scantly pay [illeg.] these folkes hyther good mayster porter? Porter. No in sothe/this hous is of no such supporter They haue houses/and kepe full yll gestyng And to th? resorte all the hole ofspryng Whiche Berbycan/and in Turnmyll strete In Houndesdyche/and behynd the Flete And in twenty places mo than there Where they make reuell and gaudy chere Wich fyll the pot fyll/go fyll me the can Here is my peny/I am a gentylman And there they byb/and fyll as dooth a gull And whan that they haue theyr heades full Than they fall out/and make reuylyng And in this wyse make the dronken rekenyng Thou beggerly knaue, bag nor staf hast thou none But as I am fayne dayly to lend the one Thou getest it no more/though it lye and rote Nor my long cloke/nor my new patched cote This rule make they/euery day and nyght Tyll lyke as swyne they lye slepyng vpryght Some beggerly churles to whome they resorte Be the maynteners of a great sorte Of myghty lubbers/and haue them in seruyce Some iourney men/&amp; some to theyr prentyce And they walke to eche market and fayre And to all places where folke do repayre By day on styltes/or stoupyng on crowches And so dyssymule as fals lewtryng slowches With bloody clowtes all about theyr legge And playsters on theyr skyn whan they go beg Some countrefayt lepry/and other some Put sope in theyr mouth to make it scome And fall downe as saynt Cornelys euyll These dysceyts they vse wors than eny deuyll And whan they be in theyr owne company They be as hole as eyther you or I But at the last/whan sekenes cometh in dede Than to the spyttell hous must they come nede Copland. Ah Iesu mercy/what man coud coniect The mysery of suche a wretched sect None honest man, but yet I you hertyly pray Tell me of other that come these way Come here ony of these maysterles men That euery where do go and ren That haue serued the kyng beyond the se And now that they out of wages be They must beg/or els go brybe and steale Me thynk it is a great soule heale To help them tyll they were pouruayd In to some seruyce for yf they were arayd Some of them were propre men and tall And able to go whyther they shall Porter. That is trouth, but they vse one yll thyng For they do were souldyers clothyng And so beggyng deceyue folke ouer all For they be vacabondes moost in generall And wyll abyde no laborous subiection With honest persones vnder correction For whan they be wery they wyll re?e a way And parcha?ce cary with them what they may And so whan a man wold bryng them to thryfe They wyll hym rob/and fro his good hym lyfe Copland. Though some so do/they do not all so For some myght chaunce well as many one do. Porter.

And neuer pardon/nor no man forgyue Tyll theyr neyghbour hath nothyng on to lyue And so they make by theyr own consyence Betwene god and the deuyll no dyffrence But hey alas/do none this way trace That do take wyues of small effycace Which cannot get/bestow/nor yet saue And to go gay they wyll spend and craue Makyng men wene that they loue them alone And be full fals vnto them echone Spendyng theyr goodes without ony care Without good gownes/but not of hoodes bare Porter. They must come hyther/for they cannot chuse For they that wyll them selfe so vse The one to gete/and the other spend And whan all is brought to an end Hether they come to haue conforte Syr I beshrew all the hole sorte Suche genyfenyes kepeth many one lowe Theyr husbandes must obey as dog to bowe Alas sely men/ye are yll at ease These deynty huswyues for to fede and please For so they syt and sew half an hour on a clout Theyr hole dayes worke is patched out And so by theyr tryflyng and lyuyng nought With other meanes they be hyther brought Copland. Well good porter/I pray you let them alone Fyr happy is he that hath a good one I pray you shewe me of other gestes For agaynst women I loue no iestes The showre is almoost done/and I haue fer to go Come none of these pedlers this way also With pak on bak/with theyr bousy speche Iagged and ragged/with broken hose &amp; breche Porter. Inow. ynow/with bousy coue maund nace Toure the patcyng coue in the darkman cace Docked the dell/for a coper meke His watch shall feng a prounces nobchete Cyarum by salmon/and thou shalt pek my iere In thy gan/for my watch it is nace gere For the bene bouse/my watch hath a wyn And thus they babble tyll theyr thryft is thyn I wote not what/with theyr pedlyng frenche But of the spyttle/they haue a party stenche And with them comes gaderers of cony skynnes That chop with laces/poyntes/nedles/&amp; pyns Copland. Come ony maryners hyther of Cok lorels bote Porter. Euery day they be alway a flote We must them receyue/&amp; gyue them costes fre And also with them the fraternyte Of vnthryftes/which do our hous endewe And neuer fayle with brethren alway newe Also here is kept/and holden in degre With in our hous the ordres .viii. tyme thre Of knaues onely/we can them not kepe out They swarme so thyke as bees in arout And chyef of all that dooth vs encombre The ordre of fooles/that be without nombre For dayly they make suche preas and cry That scant our hous can them satysfy Copland Yet one thyng I wonder that ye do not tell Come there no women this way to dwell? Porter. Of all the sortes that be spoke of afore I warraunt women ynow in store That we are wery of them euery day They come so thycke that they stop the way The systerhod of drabbes/sluttes and callets Do here resorte/with theyr bags and wallets And be parteners of the contrary Of the maynteners of yll husbandry Copland. A lewd sorte is of them of a surety Now mayster porter/I thank you hertyly Of your good talkyng/I must take my leue The shoure is done/and it is toward eue Another tyme/and at more leaser I wyll for you do as great a pleaser Porter. There be a .M. mo than I can tell But at this tyme I byd you farwell. Lenuoy of the auctour. Go lytell quayre to euery degre And on thy mater desyre them to loke Desyryng them for to pardon me That am so bolde to put them in my boke To eschue vyce, I the vndertoke By [illeg.]nyng no manre of creature I were to blame yf I them forsoke None in this world, of welth can be sure.
