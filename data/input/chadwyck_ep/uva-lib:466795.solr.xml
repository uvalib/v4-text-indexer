      <field name="fulltext">THE PRELUDE by William Wordsworth OR GROWTH OF A POET'S MIND; AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL POEM; Addressed to S. T. Coleridge. BOOK FIRST INTRODUCTION—CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME Oh there is blessing in this gentle breeze That blows from the green fields and from the clouds And from the sky: it beats against my cheek, And seems half-conscious of the joy it gives. O welcome Messenger! O welcome Friend! A captive greets thee, coming from a house Of bondage, from yon City's walls set free, A prison where he hath been long immured. Now I am free, enfranchis'd and at large, May fix my habitation where I will. What dwelling shall receive me? In what Vale Shall be my harbour? Underneath what grove Shall I take up my home, and what sweet stream Shall with its murmur lull me to my rest? The earth is all before me: with a heart Joyous, nor scar'd at its own liberty, I look about, and should the guide I chuse Be nothing better than a wandering cloud, I cannot miss my way. I breathe again; Trances of thought and mountings of the mind Come fast upon me: it is shaken off, As by miraculous gift 'tis shaken off, That burthen of my own unnatural self, The heavy weight of many a weary day Not mine, and such as were not made for me. Long months of peace (if such bold word accord With any promises of human life), Long months of ease and undisturb'd delight Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn By road or pathway or through open field, Or shall a twig or any floating thing Upon the river, point me out my course? Enough that I am free; for months to come May dedicate myself to chosen tasks; May quit the tiresome sea and dwell on shore, If not a Settler on the soil, at least To drink wild water, and to pluck green herbs, And gather fruits fresh from their native bough. Nay more, if I may trust myself, this hour Hath brought a gift that consecrates my joy; For I, methought, while the sweet breath of Heaven Was blowing on my body, felt within A corresponding mild creative breeze, A vital breeze which travell'd gently on O'er things which it had made, and is become A tempest, a redundant energy Vexing its own creation. 'Tis a power That does not come unrecogniz'd, a storm, Which, breaking up a long-continued frost Brings with it vernal promises, the hope Of active days, of dignity and thought, Of prowess in an honorable field, Pure passions, virtue, knowledge, and delight, The holy life of music and of verse. Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make A present joy the matter of my Song, Pour out, that day, my soul in measur'd strains Even in the very words which I have here Recorded: to the open fields I told A prophecy: poetic numbers came Spontaneously, and cloth'd in priestly robe My spirit, thus singled out, as it might seem, For holy services: great hopes were mine; My own voice chear'd me, and, far more, the mind's Internal echo of the imperfect sound; To both I listen'd, drawing from them both A chearful confidence in things to come. Whereat, being not unwilling now to give A respite to this passion, I paced on Gently, with careless steps; and came, erelong, To a green shady place where down I sate Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice, And settling into gentler happiness. 'Twas Autumn, and a calm and placid day, With warmth as much as needed from a sun Two hours declin'd towards the west, a day With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass, And, in the shelter'd grove where I was couch'd A perfect stillness. On the ground I lay Passing through many thoughts, yet mainly such As to myself pertain'd. I made a choice Of one sweet Vale whither my steps should turn And saw, methought, the very house and fields Present before my eyes: nor did I fail To add, meanwhile, assurance of some work Of glory, there forthwith to be begun, Perhaps, too, there perform'd. Thus long I lay Chear'd by the genial pillow of the earth Beneath my head, sooth'd by a sense of touch From the warm ground, that balanced me, else lost Entirely, seeing nought, nought hearing, save When here and there, about the grove of Oaks Where was my bed, an acorn from the trees Fell audibly, and with a startling sound. Thus occupied in mind, I linger'd here Contented, nor rose up until the sun Had almost touch'd the horizon, bidding then A farewell to the City left behind, Even with the chance equipment of that hour I journey'd towards the Vale that I had chosen. It was a splendid evening; and my soul Did once again make trial of the strength Restored to her afresh; nor did she want Eolian visitations; but the harp Was soon defrauded, and the banded host Of harmony dispers'd in straggling sounds And, lastly, utter silence. ‘Be it so, It is an injury,’ said I, ‘to this day To think of any thing but present joy.’ So like a Peasant I pursued my road Beneath the evening sun, nor had one wish Again to bend the sabbath of that time To a servile yoke. What need of many words? A pleasant loitering journey, through two days Continued, brought me to my hermitage. I spare to speak, my Friend, of what ensued, The admiration and the love, the life In common things; the endless store of things Rare, or at least so seeming, every day Found all about me in one neighbourhood, The self-congratulation, the complete Composure, and the happiness entire. But speedily a longing in me rose To brace myself to some determin'd aim, Reading or thinking, either to lay up New stores, or rescue from decay the old By timely interference, I had hopes Still higher, that with a frame of outward life, I might endue, might fix in a visible home Some portion of those phantoms of conceit That had been floating loose about so long, And to such Beings temperately deal forth The many feelings that oppressed my heart. But I have been discouraged; gleams of light Flash often from the East, then disappear And mock me with a sky that ripens not Into a steady morning: if my mind, Remembering the sweet promise of the past, Would gladly grapple with some noble theme, Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds Impediments from day to day renew'd. And now it would content me to yield up Those lofty hopes awhile for present gifts Of humbler industry. But, O dear Friend! The Poet, gentle creature as he is, Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times; His fits when he is neither sick nor well, Though no distress be near him but his own Unmanageable thoughts. The mind itself The meditative mind, best pleased, perhaps, While she, as duteous as the Mother Dove, Sits brooding, lives not always to that end, But hath less quiet instincts, goadings on That drive her as in trouble through the groves. With me is now such passion, which I blame No otherwise than as it lasts too long. When, as becomes a man who would prepare For such a glorious work, I through myself Make rigorous inquisition, the report Is often chearing; for I neither seem To lack, that first great gift! the vital soul, Nor general truths which are themselves a sort Of Elements and Agents, Under-Powers, Subordinate helpers of the living mind. Nor am I naked in external things, Forms, images; nor numerous other aids Of less regard, though won perhaps with toil, And needful to build up a Poet's praise. Time, place, and manners, these I seek, and these I find in plenteous store; but nowhere such As may be singled out with steady choice; No little Band of yet remember'd names Whom I, in perfect confidence, might hope To summon back from lonesome banishment And make them inmates in the hearts of men Now living, or to live in times to come. Sometimes, mistaking vainly, as I fear, Proud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea, I settle on some British theme, some old Romantic tale, by Milton left unsung; More often resting at some gentle place Within the groves of Chivalry, I pipe Among the Shepherds, with reposing Knights Sit by a Fountain-side, and hear their tales. Sometimes, more sternly mov'd, I would relate How vanquish'd Mithridates northward pass'd, And, hidden in the cloud of years, became That Odin, Father of a Race, by whom Perish'd the Roman Empire: how the Friends And Followers of Sertorius, out of Spain Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles; And left their usages, their arts, and laws, To disappear by a slow gradual death; To dwindle and to perish one by one Starved in those narrow bounds: but not the Soul Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred years Surviv'd, and, when the European came With skill and power that could not be withstood, Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold, And wasted down by glorious death that Race Of natural Heroes: or I would record How in tyrannic times some unknown man, Unheard of in the Chronicles of Kings, Suffer'd in silence for the love of truth; How that one Frenchman, through continued force Of meditation on the inhuman deeds Of the first Conquerors of the Indian Isles, Went single in his ministry across The Ocean, not to comfort the Oppress'd, But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about, Withering the Oppressor: how Gustavus found Help at his need in Dalecarlia's Mines: How Wallace fought for Scotland, left the name Of Wallace to be found like a wild flower, All over his dear Country, left the deeds Of Wallace, like a family of Ghosts, To people the steep rocks and river banks, Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul Of independence and stern liberty. Sometimes it suits me better to shape out Some Tale from my own heart, more near akin To my own passions and habitual thoughts, Some variegated story, in the main Lofty, with interchange of gentler things. But deadening admonitions will succeed And the whole beauteous Fabric seems to lack Foundation, and, withal, appears throughout Shadowy and unsubstantial. Then, last wish, My last and favourite aspiration! then I yearn towards some philosophic Song Of Truth that cherishes our daily life; With meditations passionate from deep Recesses in man's heart, immortal verse Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre; But from this awful burthen I full soon Take refuge, and beguile myself with trust That mellower years will bring a riper mind And clearer insight. Thus from day to day I live, a mockery of the brotherhood Of vice and virtue, with no skill to part Vague longing that is bred by want of power From paramount impulse not to be withstood, A timorous capacity from prudence; From circumspection, infinite delay. Humility and modest awe themselves Betray me, serving often for a cloak To a more subtle selfishness, that now Doth lock my functions up in blank reserve, Now dupes me by an over-anxious eye That with a false activity beats off Simplicity and self-presented truth. —Ah! better far than this, to stray about Voluptuously through fields and rural walks, And ask no record of the hours, given up To vacant musing, unreprov'd neglect Of all things, and deliberate holiday; Far better never to have heard the name Of zeal and just ambition, than to live Thus baffled by a mind that every hour Turns recreant to her task, takes heart again, Then feels immediately some hollow thought Hang like an interdict upon her hopes. This is my lot; for either still I find Some imperfection in the chosen theme, Or see of absolute accomplishment Much wanting, so much wanting, in myself, That I recoil and droop, and seek repose In listlessness from vain perplexity, Unprofitably travelling towards the grave, Like a false steward who hath much received And renders nothing back.—Was it for this That one, the fairest of all Rivers, lov'd To blend his murmurs with my Nurse's song, And from his alder shades and rocky falls, And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice That flow'd along my dreams? For this, didst Thou, O Derwent! travelling over the green Plains Near my ‘sweet Birthplace’, didst thou, beauteous Stream, Make ceaseless music through the night and day Which with its steady cadence, tempering Our human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts To more than infant softness, giving me, Among the fretful dwellings of mankind, A foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm That Nature breathes among the hills and groves. When, having left his Mountains, to the Towers Of Cockermouth that beauteous River came, Behind my Father's House he pass'd, close by, Along the margin of our Terrace Walk. He was a Playmate whom we dearly lov'd. Oh! many a time have I, a five years' Child, A naked Boy, in one delightful Rill, A little Mill-race sever'd from his stream, Made one long bathing of a summer's day, Bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again Alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill, The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height, Were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone Beneath the sky, as if I had been born On Indian Plains, and from my Mother's hut Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport, A naked Savage, in the thunder shower. Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up Foster'd alike by beauty and by fear; Much favour'd in my birthplace, and no less In that beloved Vale to which, erelong, I was transplanted. Well I call to mind ('Twas at an early age, ere I had seen Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy To wander half the night among the Cliffs And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran Along the open turf. In thought and wish That time, my shoulder all with springes hung, I was a fell destroyer. On the heights Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied My anxious visitation, hurrying on, Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars Were shining o'er my head; I was alone, And seem'd to be a trouble to the peace That was among them. Sometimes it befel In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire O'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird Which was the captive of another's toils Became my prey; and, when the deed was done I heard among the solitary hills Low breathings coming after me, and sounds Of undistinguishable motion, steps Almost as silent as the turf they trod. Nor less in springtime when on southern banks The shining sun had from his knot of leaves Decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the Vales And woods were warm, was I a plunderer then In the high places, on the lonesome peaks Where'er, among the mountains and the winds, The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean My object, and inglorious, yet the end Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock But ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd, Suspended by the blast which blew amain, Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time, While on the perilous ridge I hung alone, With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind Blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky Of earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds! The mind of Man is fram'd even like the breath And harmony of music. There is a dark Invisible workmanship that reconciles Discordant elements, and makes them move In one society. Ah me! that all The terrors, all the early miseries Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all The thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd Into my mind, should ever have made up The calm existence that is mine when I Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end! Thanks likewise for the means! But I believe That Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame A favor'd Being, from his earliest dawn Of infancy doth open up the clouds, As at the touch of lightning, seeking him With gentlest visitation; not the less, Though haply aiming at the self-same end, Does it delight her sometimes to employ Severer interventions, ministry More palpable, and so she dealt with me. One evening (surely I was led by her) I went alone into a Shepherd's Boat, A Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied Within a rocky Cave, its usual home. 'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale Wherein I was a Stranger, thither come A School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays. Forth rambled from the Village Inn alone No sooner had I sight of this small Skiff, Discover'd thus by unexpected chance, Than I unloos'd her tether and embark'd. The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear Among the hoary mountains; from the Shore I push'd, and struck the oars and struck again In cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on Even like a Man who walks with stately step Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth And troubled pleasure; not without the voice Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on, Leaving behind her still on either side Small circles glittering idly in the moon, Until they melted all into one track Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose Above the Cavern of the Willow tree And now, as suited one who proudly row'd With his best skill, I fix'd a steady view Upon the top of that same craggy ridge, The bound of the horizon, for behind Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky. She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily I dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake, And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat Went heaving through the water, like a Swan; When from behind that craggy Steep, till then The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff, As if with voluntary power instinct, Uprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again, And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff Rose up between me and the stars, and still, With measur'd motion, like a living thing, Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd, And through the silent water stole my way Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree. There, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark, And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave And serious thoughts; and after I had seen That spectacle, for many days, my brain Work'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts There was a darkness, call it solitude, Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes Of hourly objects, images of trees, Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields; But huge and mighty Forms that do not live Like living men mov'd slowly through the mind By day and were the trouble of my dreams. Wisdom and Spirit of the universe! Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought! That giv'st to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion! not in vain, By day or star-light thus from my first dawn Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me The passions that build up our human Soul, Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man, But with high objects, with enduring things, With life and nature, purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought, And sanctifying, by such discipline, Both pain and fear, until we recognize A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me With stinted kindness. In November days, When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights, When, by the margin of the trembling Lake, Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went In solitude, such intercourse was mine; 'Twas mine among the fields both day and night, And by the waters all the summer long. And in the frosty season, when the sun Was set, and visible for many a mile The cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd, I heeded not the summons:—happy time It was, indeed, for all of us; to me It was a time of rapture: clear and loud The village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd about, Proud and exulting, like an untired horse, That cares not for his home.—All shod with steel, We hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games Confederate, imitative of the chace And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn, The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare. So through the darkness and the cold we flew, And not a voice was idle; with the din, Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud, The leafless trees, and every icy crag Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars, Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west The orange sky of evening died away. Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay, or sportively Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, To cut across the image of a star That gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes When we had given our bodies to the wind, And all the shadowy banks, on either side, Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still The rapid line of motion; then at once Have I, reclining back upon my heels, Stopp'd short, yet still the solitary Cliffs Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd With visible motion her diurnal round; Behind me did they stretch in solemn train Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watch'd Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep. Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills! And Souls of lonely places! can I think A vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd Such ministry, when Ye through many a year Haunting me thus among my boyish sports, On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, Impress'd upon all forms the characters Of danger or desire, and thus did make The surface of the universal earth With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear, Work like a sea? Not uselessly employ'd, I might pursue this theme through every change Of exercise and play, to which the year Did summon us in its delightful round. We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours, Nor saw a race in happiness and joy More worthy of the ground where they were sown. I would record with no reluctant voice The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line, True symbol of the foolishness of hope, Which with its strong enchantment led us on By rocks and pools, shut out from every star All the green summer, to forlorn cascades Among the windings of the mountain brooks. —Unfading recollections! at this hour The heart is almost mine with which I felt From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons The Kite high up among the fleecy clouds Pull at its rein, like an impatient Courser, Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days, Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly Dash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm. Ye lowly Cottages in which we dwelt, A ministration of your own was yours, A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love! Can I forget you, being as you were So beautiful among the pleasant fields In which ye stood? Or can I here forget The plain and seemly countenance with which Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye Delights and exultations of your own. Eager and never weary we pursued Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire At evening; when with pencil and with slate, In square divisions parcell'd out, and all With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er, We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head, In strife too humble to be named in Verse. Or round the naked table, snow-white deal, Cherry or maple, sate in close array, And to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on A thick-ribbed Army; not as in the world Neglected and ungratefully thrown by Even for the very service they had wrought, But husbanded through many a long campaign. Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards, Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth Had glorified, and call'd to represent The persons of departed Potentates. Oh! with what echoes on the Board they fell! Ironic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, A congregation piteously akin. Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit, Those sooty knaves, precipitated down With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven, The paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse, Queens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay, And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd By royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad The heavy rain was falling, or the frost Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth, And, interrupting oft the impassion'd game, From Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting ice, While it sank down towards the water, sent, Among the meadows and the hills, its long And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves When they are howling round the Bothnic Main. Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace How Nature by extrinsic passion first Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand, And made me love them, may I here forget How other pleasures have been mine, and joys Of subtler origin; how I have felt, Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time, Those hallow'd and pure motions of the sense Which seem, in their simplicity, to own An intellectual charm, that calm delight Which, if I err not, surely must belong To those first-born affinities that fit Our new existence to existing things, And, in our dawn of being, constitute The bond of union betwixt life and joy. Yes, I remember, when the changeful earth, And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd The faces of the moving year, even then, A Child, I held unconscious intercourse With the eternal Beauty, drinking in A pure organic pleasure from the lines Of curling mist, or from the level plain Of waters colour'd by the steady clouds. The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell How when the Sea threw off his evening shade And to the Shepherd's huts beneath the crags Did send sweet notice of the rising moon, How I have stood, to fancies such as these, Engrafted in the tenderness of thought, A stranger, linking with the spectacle No conscious memory of a kindred sight, And bringing with me no peculiar sense Of quietness or peace, yet I have stood, Even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues Of shining water, gathering, as it seem'd, Through every hair-breadth of that field of light, New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers. Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss Which, like a tempest, works along the blood And is forgotten; even then I felt Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth And common face of Nature spake to me Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true, By chance collisions and quaint accidents Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain Nor profitless, if haply they impress'd Collateral objects and appearances, Albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep Until maturer seasons call'd them forth To impregnate and to elevate the mind. —And if the vulgar joy by its own weight Wearied itself out of the memory, The scenes which were a witness of that joy Remained, in their substantial lineaments Depicted on the brain, and to the eye Were visible, a daily sight; and thus By the impressive discipline of fear, By pleasure and repeated happiness, So frequently repeated, and by force Of obscure feelings representative Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes, So beauteous and majestic in themselves, Though yet the day was distant, did at length Become habitually dear, and all Their hues and forms were by invisible links Allied to the affections. I began My story early, feeling as I fear, The weakness of a human love, for days Disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring Planting my snowdrops among winter snows. Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt In sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out, With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale. Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch Invigorating thoughts from former years, Might fix the wavering balance of my mind, And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power May spur me on, in manhood now mature, To honorable toil. Yet should these hopes Be vain, and thus should neither I be taught To understand myself, nor thou to know With better knowledge how the heart was fram'd Of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit Those recollected hours that have the charm Of visionary things, and lovely forms And sweet sensations that throw back our life And almost make our Infancy itself A visible scene, on which the sun is shining? One end hereby at least hath been attain'd, My mind hath been revived, and if this mood Desert me not, I will forthwith bring down, Through later years, the story of my life. The road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme Single and of determined bounds; and hence I chuse it rather at this time, than work Of ampler or more varied argument. BOOK SECOND SCHOOL-TIME—(CONTINUED) Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much Unvisited, endeavour'd to retrace My life through its first years, and measured back The way I travell'd when I first began To love the woods and fields; the passion yet Was in its birth, sustain'd, as might befal, By nourishment that came unsought; for still, From week to week, from month to month, we liv'd A round of tumult: duly were our games Prolong'd in summer till the day-light fail'd; No chair remain'd before the doors, the bench And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep The Labourer, and the Old Man who had sate, A later lingerer, yet the revelry Continued, and the loud uproar: at last, When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went, With weary joints, and with a beating mind. Ah! is there one who ever has been young, Nor needs a monitory voice to tame The pride of virtue, and of intellect? And is there one, the wisest and the best Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish For things which cannot be, who would not give, If so he might, to duty and to truth The eagerness of infantine desire? A tranquillizing spirit presses now On my corporeal frame: so wide appears The vacancy between me and those days, Which yet have such self-presence in my mind That, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself And of some other Being. A grey Stone Of native rock, left midway in the Square Of our small market Village, was the home And centre of these joys, and when, return'd After long absence, thither I repair'd, I found that it was split, and gone to build A smart Assembly-room that perk'd and flar'd With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream, And be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know That more than one of you will think with me Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame From whom the stone was nam'd who there had sate And watch'd her Table with its huckster's wares Assiduous, thro' the length of sixty years. We ran a boisterous race; the year span round With giddy motion. But the time approach'd That brought with it a regular desire For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms Of Nature were collaterally attach'd To every scheme of holiday delight, And every boyish sport, less grateful else, And languidly pursued. When summer came It was the pastime of our afternoons To beat along the plain of Windermere With rival oars, and the selected bourne Was now an Island musical with birds That sang for ever; now a Sister Isle Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown With lillies of the valley, like a field; And now a third small Island where remain'd An old stone Table, and a moulder'd Cave, A Hermit's history. In such a race, So ended, disappointment could be none, Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy: We rested in the shade, all pleas'd alike, Conquer'd and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength, And the vain-glory of superior skill Were interfus'd with objects which subdu'd And temper'd them, and gradually produc'd A quiet independence of the heart. And to my Friend, who knows me, I may add, Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence Ensu'd a diffidence and modesty, And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much, The self-sufficing power of solitude. No delicate viands sapp'd our bodily strength; More than we wish'd we knew the blessing then Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals Were frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude A little weekly stipend, and we lived Through three divisions of the quarter'd year In pennyless poverty. But now, to School Return'd, from the half-yearly holidays, We came with purses more profusely fill'd, Allowance which abundantly suffic'd To gratify the palate with repasts More costly than the Dame of whom I spake, That ancient Woman, and her board supplied. Hence inroads into distant Vales, and long Excursions far away among the hills, Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground, Or in the woods, or near a river side, Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy. Nor is my aim neglected, if I tell How twice in the long length of those half-years We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least, To feel the motion of the galloping Steed; And with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth, On such occasion sometimes we employ'd Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound Of the day's journey was too distant far For any cautious man, a Structure famed Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls Of that large Abbey which within the Vale Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built, Stands yet, a mouldering pile, with fractured Arch, Belfry, and Images, and living Trees, A holy Scene! along the smooth green turf Our Horses grazed: to more than inland peace Left by the sea wind passing overhead (Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers May in that Valley oftentimes be seen, Both silent and both motionless alike; Such is the shelter that is there, and such The safeguard for repose and quietness. Our steeds remounted, and the summons given, With whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg'd Knight, And the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren Which one day sang so sweetly in the Nave Of the old Church, that, though from recent showers The earth was comfortless, and, touch'd by faint Internal breezes, sobbings of the place, And respirations, from the roofless walls The shuddering ivy dripp'd large drops, yet still, So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible Bird Sang to itself, that there I could have made My dwelling-place, and liv'd for ever there To hear such music. Through the Walls we flew And down the valley, and a circuit made In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth We scamper'd homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams, And that still Spirit of the evening air! Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt Your presence, when with slacken'd step we breath'd Along the sides of the steep hills, or when, Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea, We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand. Upon the Eastern Shore of Windermere, Above the crescent of a pleasant Bay, There stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed, Brother of the surrounding Cottages, But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset With Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within Decanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine. In ancient times, or ere the Hall was built On the large Island, had this Dwelling been More worthy of a Poet's love, a Hut, Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade. But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed The threshold, and large golden characters On the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp'd The place of the old Lion, in contempt And mockery of the rustic painter's hand, Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay Upon a slope surmounted by the plain Of a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood A grove; with gleams of water through the trees And over the tree-tops; nor did we want Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream. And there, through half an afternoon, we play'd On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall Of night, when in our pinnace we return'd Over the dusky Lake, and to the beach Of some small Island steer'd our course with one, The Minstrel of our troop, and left him there, And row'd off gently, while he blew his flute Alone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm And dead still water lay upon my mind Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky Never before so beautiful, sank down Into my heart, and held me like a dream. Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged, And thus the common range of visible things Grew dear to me: already I began To love the sun, a Boy I lov'd the sun, Not as I since have lov'd him, as a pledge And surety of our earthly life, a light Which while we view we feel we are alive; But, for this cause, that I had seen him lay His beauty on the morning hills, had seen The western mountain touch his setting orb, In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess Of happiness, my blood appear'd to flow With its own pleasure, and I breath'd with joy. And from like feelings, humble though intense, To patriotic and domestic love Analogous, the moon to me was dear; For I would dream away my purposes, Standing to look upon her while she hung Midway between the hills, as if she knew No other region; but belong'd to thee, Yea, appertain'd by a peculiar right To thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale! Those incidental charms which first attach'd My heart to rural objects, day by day Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell How Nature, intervenient till this time, And secondary, now at length was sought For her own sake. But who shall parcel out His intellect, by geometric rules, Split, like a province, into round and square? Who knows the individual hour in which His habits were first sown, even as a seed, Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say, ‘This portion of the river of my mind Came from yon fountain?’ Thou, my Friend! art one More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee Science appears but, what in truth she is, Not as our glory and our absolute boast, But as a succedaneum, and a prop To our infirmity. Thou art no slave Of that false secondary power, by which, In weakness, we create distinctions, then Deem that our puny boundaries are things Which we perceive, and not which we have made. To thee, unblinded by these outward shows, The unity of all has been reveal'd And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill'd Than many are to class the cabinet Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase, Run through the history and birth of each, As of a single independent thing. Hard task to analyse a soul, in which, Not only general habits and desires, But each most obvious and particular thought, Not in a mystical and idle sense, But in the words of reason deeply weigh'd, Hath no beginning. Bless'd the infant Babe, (For with my best conjectures I would trace The progress of our Being) blest the Babe, Nurs'd in his Mother's arms, the Babe who sleeps Upon his Mother's breast, who, when his soul Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul, Doth gather passion from his Mother's eye! Such feelings pass into his torpid life Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind Even [in the first trial of its powers] Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine In one appearance, all the elements And parts of the same object, else detach'd And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day, Subjected to the discipline of love, His organs and recipient faculties Are quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads, Tenacious of the forms which it receives. In one beloved presence, nay and more, In that most apprehensive habitude And those sensations which have been deriv'd From this beloved Presence, there exists A virtue which irradiates and exalts All objects through all intercourse of sense. No outcast he, bewilder'd and depress'd; Along his infant veins are interfus'd The gravitation and the filial bond Of nature, that connect him with the world. Emphatically such a Being lives, An inmate of this active universe; From nature largely he receives; nor so Is satisfied, but largely gives again, For feeling has to him imparted strength, And powerful in all sentiments of grief, Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind, Even as an agent of the one great mind, Creates, creator and receiver both, Working but in alliance with the works Which it beholds.—Such, verily, is the first Poetic spirit of our human life; By uniform control of after years In most abated or suppress'd, in some, Through every change of growth or of decay, Pre-eminent till death. From early days, Beginning not long after that first time In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch, I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart I have endeavour'd to display the means Whereby this infant sensibility, Great birthright of our Being, was in me Augmented and sustain'd. Yet is a path More difficult before me, and I fear That in its broken windings we shall need The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing: For now a trouble came into my mind From unknown causes. I was left alone, Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why. The props of my affections were remov'd, And yet the building stood, as if sustain'd By its own spirit! All that I beheld Was dear to me, and from this cause it came, That now to Nature's finer influxes My mind lay open, to that more exact And intimate communion which our hearts Maintain with the minuter properties Of objects which already are belov'd, And of those only. Many are the joys Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live When every hour brings palpable access Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight, And sorrow is not there. The seasons came, And every season to my notice brought A store of transitory qualities Which, but for this most watchful power of love Had been neglected, left a register Of permanent relations, else unknown, Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude More active, even, than ‘best society’, Society made sweet as solitude By silent inobtrusive sympathies, And gentle agitations of the mind From manifold distinctions, difference Perceived in things, where to the common eye, No difference is; and hence, from the same source Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone, In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights Beneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time, Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound To breathe an elevated mood, by form Or image unprofaned; and I would stand, Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are The ghostly language of the ancient earth, Or make their dim abode in distant winds. Thence did I drink the visionary power. I deem not profitless these fleeting moods Of shadowy exultation: not for this, That they are kindred to our purer mind And intellectual life; but that the soul, Remembering how she felt, but what she felt Remembering not, retains an obscure sense Of possible sublimity, to which, With growing faculties she doth aspire, With faculties still growing, feeling still That whatsoever point they gain, they still Have something to pursue. And not alone, In grandeur and in tumult, but no less In tranquil scenes, that universal power And fitness in the latent qualities And essences of things, by which the mind Is mov'd by feelings of delight, to me Came strengthen'd with a superadded soul, A virtue not its own. My morning walks Were early; oft, before the hours of School I travell'd round our little Lake, five miles Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear For this, that one was by my side, a Friend Then passionately lov'd; with heart how full Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps A blank to other men! for many years Have since flow'd in between us; and our minds, Both silent to each other, at this time We live as if those hours had never been. Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush Was audible, among the hills I sate Alone, upon some jutting eminence At the first hour of morning, when the Vale Lay quiet in an utter solitude. How shall I trace the history, where seek The origin of what I then have felt? Oft in these moments such a holy calm Did overspread my soul, that I forgot That I had bodily eyes, and what I saw Appear'd like something in myself, a dream, A prospect in my mind. 'Twere long to tell What spring and autumn, what the winter snows, And what the summer shade, what day and night, The evening and the morning, what my dreams And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse That spirit of religious love in which I walked with Nature. But let this, at least Be not forgotten, that I still retain'd My first creative sensibility, That by the regular action of the world My soul was unsubdu'd. A plastic power Abode with me, a forming hand, at times Rebellious, acting in a devious mood, A local spirit of its own, at war With general tendency, but for the most Subservient strictly to the external things With which it commun'd. An auxiliar light Came from my mind which on the setting sun Bestow'd new splendor, the melodious birds, The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on, Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey'd A like dominion; and the midnight storm Grew darker in the presence of my eye. Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence, And hence my transport. Nor should this, perchance, Pass unrecorded, that I still had lov'd The exercise and produce of a toil Than analytic industry to me More pleasing, and whose character I deem Is more poetic as resembling more Creative agency. I mean to speak Of that interminable building rear'd By observation of affinities In objects where no brotherhood exists To common minds. My seventeenth year was come And, whether from this habit, rooted now So deeply in my mind, or from excess Of the great social principle of life, Coercing all things into sympathy, To unorganic natures I transferr'd My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth Coming in revelation, I convers'd With things that really are, I, at this time Saw blessings spread around me like a sea. Thus did my days pass on, and now at length From Nature and her overflowing soul I had receiv'd so much that all my thoughts Were steep'd in feeling; I was only then Contented when with bliss ineffable I felt the sentiment of Being spread O'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still, O'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought And human knowledge, to the human eye Invisible, yet liveth to the heart, O'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings, Or beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not If such my transports were; for in all things now I saw one life, and felt that it was joy. One song they sang, and it was audible, Most audible then when the fleshly ear, O'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain, Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb'd. If this be error, and another faith Find easier access to the pious mind, Yet were I grossly destitute of all Those human sentiments which make this earth So dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice To speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes, And sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds That dwell among the hills where I was born. If, in my youth, I have been pure in heart, If, mingling with the world, I am content With my own modest pleasures, and have liv'd, With God and Nature communing, remov'd From little enmities and low desires, The gift is yours; if in these times of fear, This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown, If, 'mid indifference and apathy And wicked exultation, when good men, On every side fall off we know not how, To selfishness, disguis'd in gentle names Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love, Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers On visionary minds; if in this time Of dereliction and dismay, I yet Despair not of our nature; but retain A more than Roman confidence, a faith That fails not, in all sorrow my support, The blessing of my life, the gift is yours, Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed My lofty speculations; and in thee, For this uneasy heart of ours I find A never-failing principle of joy, And purest passion. Thou, my Friend! wert rear'd In the great City, 'mid far other scenes; But we, by different roads at length have gain'd The self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee I speak, unapprehensive of contempt, The insinuated scoff of coward tongues, And all that silent language which so oft In conversation betwixt man and man Blots from the human countenance all trace Of beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought The truth in solitude, and Thou art one, The most intense of Nature's worshippers In many things my Brother, chiefly here In this my deep devotion. Fare Thee well! Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men, And yet more often living with Thyself, And for Thyself, so haply shall thy days Be many, and a blessing to mankind. BOOK THIRD RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE It was a dreary morning when the Chaise Roll'd over the flat Plains of Huntingdon And, through the open windows, first I saw The long-back'd Chapel of King's College rear His pinnacles above the dusky groves. Soon afterwards, we espied upon the road, A student cloth'd in Gown and tassell'd Cap; He pass'd; nor was I master of my eyes Till he was left a hundred yards behind. The Place, as we approach'd, seem'd more and more To have an eddy's force, and suck'd us in More eagerly at every step we took. Onward we drove beneath the Castle, down By Magdalene Bridge we went and cross'd the Cam, And at the Hoop we landed, famous Inn. My spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope; Some Friends I had, acquaintances who there Seem'd Friends, poor simple Schoolboys, now hung round With honour and importance; in a world Of welcome faces up and down I rov'd; Questions, directions, counsel and advice Flow'd in upon me from all sides, fresh day Of pride and pleasure! to myself I seem'd A man of business and expense, and went From shop to shop about my own affairs, To Tutors or to Tailors, as befel, From street to street with loose and careless heart. I was the Dreamer, they the Dream; I roam'd Delighted, through the motley spectacle; Gowns grave or gaudy, Doctors, Students, Streets, Lamps, Gateways, Flocks of Churches, Courts and Towers: Strange transformation for a mountain Youth, A northern Villager. As if by word Of magic or some Fairy's power, at once Behold me rich in monies, and attir'd In splendid clothes, with hose of silk, and hair Glittering like rimy trees when frost is keen. My lordly Dressing-gown I pass it by, With other signs of manhood which supplied The lack of beard.—The weeks went roundly on, With invitations, suppers, wine, and fruit, Smooth housekeeping within, and all without Liberal and suiting Gentleman's array! The Evangelist St. John my Patron was, Three gloomy Courts are his; and in the first Was my abiding-place, a nook obscure! Right underneath, the College kitchens made A humming sound, less tuneable than bees, But hardly less industrious; with shrill notes Of sharp command and scolding intermix'd. Near me was Trinity's loquacious Clock, Who never let the Quarters, night or day, Slip by him unproclaim'd, and told the hours Twice over with a male and female voice. Her pealing organ was my neighbour too; And, from my Bedroom, I in moonlight nights Could see, right opposite, a few yards off, The Antechapel, where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his Prism and silent Face. Of College labours, of the Lecturer's Room, All studded round, as thick as chairs could stand, With loyal Students, faithful to their Books, Half-and-half Idlers, hardy Recusants, And honest Dunces;—of important Days, Examinations, when the Man was weigh'd As in the balance,—of excessive hopes, Tremblings withal, and commendable fears, Small jealousies, and triumphs good or bad I make short mention; things they were which then I did not love, nor do I love them now. Such glory was but little sought by me, And little won. But it is right to say That even so early, from the first crude days Of settling-time in this my new abode, Not seldom I had melancholy thoughts, From personal and family regards, Wishing to hope without a hope; some fears About my future worldly maintenance, And, more than all, a strangeness in my mind, A feeling that I was not for that hour, Nor for that place. But wherefore be cast down? Why should I grieve? I was a chosen Son. For hither I had come with holy powers And faculties, whether to work or feel: To apprehend all passions and all moods Which time, and place, and season do impress Upon the visible universe, and work Like changes there by force of my own mind. I was a Freeman; in the purest sense Was free, and to majestic ends was strong. I do not speak of learning, moral truth, Or understanding; 'twas enough for me To know that I was otherwise endow'd. When the first glitter of the show was pass'd, And the first dazzle of the taper light, As if with a rebound my mind return'd Into its former self. Oft did I leave My Comrades, and the Crowd, Buildings and Groves, And walked along the fields, the level fields, With Heaven's blue concave rear'd above my head; And now it was, that, from such change entire And this first absence from those shapes sublime Wherewith I had been conversant, my mind Seem'd busier in itself than heretofore; At least, I more directly recognised My powers and habits: let me dare to speak A higher language, say that now I felt The strength and consolation which were mine. As if awaken'd, summon'd, rous'd, constrain'd, I look'd for universal things; perused The common countenance of earth and heaven; And, turning the mind in upon itself, Pored, watch'd, expected, listen'd; spread my thoughts And spread them with a wider creeping; felt Incumbencies more awful, visitings Of the Upholder of the tranquil Soul, Which underneath all passion lives secure A steadfast life. But peace! it is enough To notice that I was ascending now To such community with highest truth. A track pursuing not untrod before, From deep analogies by thought supplied, Or consciousnesses not to be subdued, To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower, Even the loose stones that cover the high-way, I gave a moral life, I saw them feel, Or link'd them to some feeling: the great mass Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all That I beheld respired with inward meaning. Thus much for the one Presence, and the Life Of the great whole; suffice it here to add That whatsoe'er of Terror or of Love, Or Beauty, Nature's daily face put on From transitory passion, unto this I was as wakeful, even, as waters are To the sky's motion; in a kindred sense Of passion was obedient as a lute That waits upon the touches of the wind. So was it with me in my solitude; So often among multitudes of men. Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich, I had a world about me; 'twas my own, I made it; for it only liv'd to me, And to the God who look'd into my mind. Such sympathies would sometimes shew themselves By outward gestures and by visible looks. Some call'd it madness: such, indeed, it was, If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy, If steady moods of thoughtfulness, matur'd To inspiration, sort with such a name; If prophecy be madness; if things view'd By Poets in old time, and higher up By the first men, earth's first inhabitants, May in these tutor'd days no more be seen With undisorder'd sight: but leaving this It was no madness: for I had an eye Which in my strongest workings, evermore Was looking for the shades of difference As they lie hid in all exterior forms, Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye Which from a stone, a tree, a wither'd leaf, To the broad ocean and the azure heavens, Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars, Could find no surface where its power might sleep, Which spake perpetual logic to my soul, And by an unrelenting agency Did bind my feelings, even as in a chain. And here, O Friend! have I retrac'd my life Up to an eminence, and told a tale Of matters which, not falsely, I may call The glory of my youth. Of Genius, Power, Creation and Divinity itself I have been speaking, for my theme has been What pass'd within me. Not of outward things Done visibly for other minds, words, signs, Symbols or actions; but of my own heart Have I been speaking, and my youthful mind. O Heavens! how awful is the might of Souls, And what they do within themselves, while yet The yoke of earth is new to them, the world Nothing but a wild field where they were sown. This is, in truth, heroic argument, And genuine prowess; which I wish'd to touch With hand however weak; but in the main It lies far hidden from the reach of words. Points have we all of us within our souls, Where all stand single; this I feel, and make Breathings for incommunicable powers. Yet each man is a memory to himself, And, therefore, now that I must quit this theme, I am not heartless; for there's not a man That lives who hath not had his godlike hours, And knows not what majestic sway we have, As natural beings in the strength of nature. Enough: for now into a populous Plain We must descend.—A Traveller I am, And all my Tale is of myself; even so, So be it, if the pure in heart delight To follow me; and Thou, O honor'd Friend! Who in my thoughts art ever at my side, Uphold, as heretofore, my fainting steps. It hath been told already, how my sight Was dazzled by the novel show, and how, Erelong, I did into myself return. So did it seem, and so, in truth, it was. Yet this was but short liv'd: thereafter came Observance less devout. I had made a change In climate; and my nature's outward coat Changed also, slowly and insensibly. To the deep quiet and majestic thoughts Of loneliness succeeded empty noise And superficial pastimes; now and then Forced labour; and, more frequently, forced hopes; And, worse than all, a treasonable growth Of indecisive judgments that impair'd And shook the mind's simplicity. And yet This was a gladsome time. Could I behold, Who less insensible than sodden clay On a sea River's bed at ebb of tide, Could have beheld with undelighted heart, So many happy Youths, so wide and fair A congregation, in its budding-time Of health, and hope, and beauty; all at once So many divers samples of the growth Of life's sweet season, could have seen unmov'd That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers Upon the matron temples of a Place So famous through the world? To me, at least, It was a goodly prospect: for, through youth, Though I had been train'd up to stand unpropp'd, And independent musings pleased me so That spells seem'd on me when I was alone, Yet could I only cleave to solitude In lonesome places; if a throng was near That way I lean'd by nature; for my heart Was social, and lov'd idleness and joy. Not seeking those who might participate My deeper pleasures (nay I had not once, Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs, Even with myself divided such delight, Or looked that way for aught that might be cloath'd In human language), easily I pass'd From the remembrances of better things, And slipp'd into the weekday works of youth, Unburthen'd, unalarm'd, and unprofan'd. Caverns there were within my mind, which sun Could never penetrate, yet did there not Want store of leafy arbours where the light Might enter in at will. Companionships, Friendships, acquaintances, were welcome all; We saunter'd, play'd, we rioted, we talk'd Unprofitable talk at morning hours, Drifted about along the streets and walks, Read lazily in lazy books, went forth To gallop through the country in blind zeal Of senseless horsemanship, or on the breast Of Cam sail'd boisterously; and let the stars Come out, perhaps without one quiet thought. Such was the tenor of the opening act In this new life. Imagination slept, And yet not utterly. I could not print Ground where the grass had yielded to the steps Of generations of illustrious Men, Unmov'd; I could not always lightly pass Through the same Gateways; sleep where they had slept, Wake where they wak'd, range that enclosure old That garden of great intellects undisturb'd. Place also by the side of this dark sense Of nobler feeling, that those spiritual Men, Even the great Newton's own etherial Self, Seem'd humbled in these precincts; thence to be The more belov'd; invested here with tasks Of life's plain business, as a daily garb; Dictators at the plough, a change that left All genuine admiration unimpair'd. Beside the pleasant Mills of Trompington I laugh'd with Chaucer; in the hawthorn shade Heard him (while birds were warbling) tell his tales Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard, Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State, Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace, I call'd him Brother, Englishman, and Friend. Yea, our blind Poet, who, in his later day, Stood almost single, uttering odious truth, Darkness before, and danger's voice behind; Soul awful! if the earth has ever lodg'd An awful Soul, I seem'd to see him here Familiarly, and in his Scholar's dress Bounding before me, yet a stripling Youth, A Boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks Angelical, keen eye, courageous look, And conscious step of purity and pride. Among the band of my Compeers was one My class-fellow at School, whose chance it was To lodge in the Apartments which had been, Time out of mind, honor'd by Milton's name; The very shell reputed of the abode Which he had tenanted. O temperate Bard! One afternoon, the first time I set foot In this thy innocent Nest and Oratory, Seated with others in a festive ring Of common-place convention, I to thee Pour'd out libations, to thy memory drank, Within my private thoughts, till my brain reel'd Never so clouded by the fumes of wine Before that hour, or since. Thence forth I ran From that assembly, through a length of streets, Ran, Ostrich-like, to reach our Chapel Door In not a desperate or opprobrious time, Albeit long after the importunate Bell Had stopp'd, with wearisome Cassandra voice No longer haunting the dark winter night. Call back, O Friend! a moment to thy mind, The place itself and fashion of the rites. Upshouldering in a dislocated lump, With shallow ostentatious carelessness, My Surplice, gloried in, and yet despised, I clove in pride through the inferior throng Of the plain Burghers, who in audience stood On the last skirts of their permitted ground, Beneath the pealing Organ. Empty thoughts! I am ashamed of them; and that great Bard, And thou, O Friend! who in thy ample mind Hast station'd me for reverence and love, Ye will forgive the weakness of that hour In some of its unworthy vanities, Brother of many more. In this mix'd sort The months pass'd on, remissly, not given up To wilful alienation from the right, Or walks of open scandal; but in vague And loose indifference, easy likings, aims Of a low pitch; duty and zeal dismiss'd, Yet nature, or a happy course of things Not doing in their stead the needful work. The memory languidly revolv'd, the heart Repos'd in noontide rest; the inner pulse Of contemplation almost fail'd to beat. Rotted as by a charm, my life became A floating island, an amphibious thing, Unsound, of spongy texture, yet withal, Not wanting a fair face of water-weeds And pleasant flowers.—The thirst of living praise, A reverence for the glorious Dead, the sight Of those long Vistas, Catacombs in which Perennial minds lie visibly entomb'd, Have often stirr'd the heart of youth, and bred A fervent love of rigorous discipline. Alas! such high commotion touched not me; No look was in these walls to put to shame My easy spirits, and discountenance Their light composure, far less to instil A calm resolve of mind, firmly address'd To puissant efforts. Nor was this the blame Of others but my own; I should, in truth, As far as doth concern my single self Misdeem most widely, lodging it elsewhere. For I, bred up in Nature's lap, was even As a spoil'd Child; and rambling like the wind As I had done in daily intercourse With those delicious rivers, solemn heights, And mountains; ranging like a fowl of the air, I was ill tutor'd for captivity, To quit my pleasure, and from month to month, Take up a station calmly on the perch Of sedentary peace. Those lovely forms Had also left less space within my mind, Which, wrought upon instinctively, had found A freshness in those objects of its love, A winning power, beyond all other power. Not that I slighted Books; that were to lack All sense; but other passions had been mine, More fervent, making me less prompt, perhaps, To in-door study than was wise or well Or suited to my years. Yet I could shape The image of a Place which, sooth'd and lull'd As I had been, train'd up in paradise Among sweet garlands and delightful sounds, Accustom'd in my loneliness to walk With Nature magisterially, yet I, Methinks, could shape the image of a Place Which with its aspect should have bent me down To instantaneous service, should at once Have made me pay to science and to arts And written lore, acknowledg'd my liege Lord, A homage, frankly offer'd up, like that Which I had paid to Nature. Toil and pains In this recess which I have bodied forth Should spread from heart to heart; and stately groves, Majestic edifices, should not want A corresponding dignity within. The congregating temper, which pervades Our unripe years, not wasted, should be made To minister to works of high attempt, Which the enthusiast would perform with love; Youth should be aw'd, possess'd, as with a sense Religious, of what holy joy there is In knowledge, if it be sincerely sought For its own sake, in glory, and in praise, If but by labour won, and to endure. The passing Day should learn to put aside Her trappings here, should strip them off, abash'd Before antiquity, and steadfast truth, And strong book-mindedness; and over all Should be a healthy, sound simplicity, A seemly plainness, name it what you will, Republican or pious. If these thoughts Be a gratuitous emblazonry That does but mock this recreant age, at least Let Folly and False-seeming, we might say, Be free to affect whatever formal gait Of moral or scholastic discipline Shall raise them highest in their own esteem; Let them parade, among the Schools, at will; But spare the House of God. Was ever known The witless Shepherd who would drive his Flock With serious repetition to a pool Of which 'tis plain to sight they never taste? A weight must surely hang on days begun And ended with worst mockery: be wise, Ye Presidents and Deans, and to your Bells Give seasonable rest; for 'tis a sound Hollow as ever vex'd the tranquil air; And your officious doings bring disgrace On the plain Steeples of our English Church, Whose worship 'mid remotest village trees Suffers for this. Even Science, too, at hand In daily sight of such irreverence, Is smitten thence with an unnatural taint, Loses her just authority, falls beneath Collateral suspicion, else unknown. This obvious truth did not escape me then, Unthinking as I was, and I confess That, having in my native hills given loose To a Schoolboy's dreaming, I had rais'd a pile Upon the basis of the coming time, Which now before me melted fast away, Which could not live, scarcely had life enough To mock the Builder. Oh! what joy it were To see a Sanctuary for our Country's Youth, With such a spirit in it as might be Protection for itself, a Virgin grove, Primaeval in its purity and depth; Where, though the shades were fill'd with chearfulness, Nor indigent of songs, warbled from crowds In under-coverts, yet the countenance Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe; A habitation sober and demure For ruminating creatures, a domain For quiet things to wander in, a haunt In which the Heron might delight to feed By the shy rivers, and the Pelican Upon the cypress spire in lonely thought Might sit and sun himself. Alas! alas! In vain for such solemnity we look; Our eyes are cross'd by Butterflies, our ears Hear chattering Popinjays; the inner heart Is trivial, and the impresses without Are of a gaudy region. Different sight Those venerable Doctors saw of old When all who dwelt within these famous Walls Led in abstemiousness a studious life, When, in forlorn and naked chambers coop'd And crowded, o'er the ponderous Books they sate Like caterpillars eating out their way In silence, or with keen devouring noise Not to be track'd or father'd. Princes then At matins froze, and couch'd at curfew-time, Trained up, through piety and zeal, to prize Spare diet, patient labour, and plain weeds. O Seat of Arts! renown'd throughout the world, Far different service in those homely days The Nurslings of the Muses underwent From their first childhood; in that glorious time, When Learning, like a Stranger come from far, Sounding through Christian Lands her Trumpet, rouz'd The Peasant and the King; when Boys and Youths, The growth of ragged villages and huts, Forsook their homes, and, errant in the quest Of Patron, famous School or friendly Nook, Where, pension'd, they in shelter might sit down, From Town to Town and through wide-scatter'd Realms Journeyed with their huge folios in their hands; And often, starting from some covert place, Saluted the chance-comer on the road, Crying, ‘an obolus, a penny give To a poor Scholar’; when illustrious Men, Lovers of truth, by penury constrain'd, Bucer, Erasmus, or Melancthon read Before the doors or windows of their Cells By moonshine, through mere lack of taper light. But peace to vain regrets! We see but darkly Even when we look behind us; and best things Are not so pure by nature that they needs Must keep to all, as fondly all believe, Their highest promise. If the Mariner, When at reluctant distance he hath pass'd Some fair enticing Island, did but know What fate might have been his, could he have brought His Bark to land upon the wished-for spot, Good cause full often would be his to bless The belt of churlish Surf that scared him thence, Or haste of the inexorable wind. For me, I grieve not; happy is the man, Who only misses what I miss'd, who falls No lower than I fell. I did not love, As hath been noticed heretofore, the guise Of our scholastic studies; could have wish'd The river to have had an ampler range, And freer pace; but this I tax not; far Far more I griev'd to see among the Band Of those who in the field of contest stood As combatants, passions that did to me Seem low and mean; from ignorance of mine, In part, and want of just forbearance, yet My wiser mind grieves now for what I saw. Willingly did I part from these, and turn Out of their track, to travel with the shoal Of more unthinking Natures; easy Minds And pillowy; and not wanting love that makes The day pass lightly on, when foresight sleeps, And wisdom, and the pledges interchanged With our own inner being are forgot. To Books, our daily fare prescrib'd, I turn'd With sickly appetite, and when I went, At other times, in quest of my own food, I chaced not steadily the manly deer, But laid me down to any casual feast Of wild wood-honey; or, with truant eyes Unruly, peep'd about for vagrant fruit. And, as for what pertains to human life, The deeper passions working round me here, Whether of envy, jealousy, pride, shame, Ambition, emulation, fear, or hope, Or those of dissolute pleasure, were by me Unshar'd; and only now and then observ'd, So little was their hold upon my being, As outward things that might administer To knowledge or instruction. Hush'd, meanwhile, Was the under soul, lock'd up in such a calm, That not a leaf of the great nature stirr'd. Yet was this deep vacation not given up To utter waste. Hitherto I had stood In my own mind remote from human life, At least from what we commonly so name, Even as a shepherd on a promontory, Who, lacking occupation, looks far forth Into the endless sea, and rather makes Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is That this first transit from the smooth delights, And wild outlandish walks of simple youth, To something that resembled an approach Towards mortal business; to a privileg'd world Within a world, a midway residence With all its intervenient imagery, Did better suit my visionary mind, Far better, than to have been bolted forth, Thrust out abruptly into Fortune's way Among the conflicts of substantial life; By a more just gradation did lead on To higher things, more naturally matur'd, For permanent possession, better fruits Whether of truth or virtue, to ensue. In playful zest of fancy did we note, (How could we less?) the manners and the ways Of those who in the livery were array'd Of good or evil fame; of those with whom By frame of academic discipline Perforce we were connected, men whose sway And whose authority of Office serv'd To set our minds on edge, and did no more. Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind, Found everywhere; but chiefly, in the ring Of the grave Elders, Men unscour'd, grotesque In character; trick'd out like aged trees Which, through the lapse of their infirmity, Give ready place to any random seed That chuses to be rear'd upon their trunks. Here on my view, confronting as it were Those Shepherd Swains whom I had lately left, Did flash a different image of old age; How different! yet both withal alike, A Book of rudiments for the unpractis'd sight, Objects emboss'd! and which with sedulous care Nature holds up before the eye of Youth In her great School; with further view, perhaps, To enter early on her tender scheme Of teaching comprehension with delight, And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts. The surfaces of artificial life And manners finely spun, the delicate race Of colours, lurking, gleaming up and down Through that state arras woven with silk and gold; This wily interchange of snaky hues, Willingly and unwillingly reveal'd I had not learn'd to watch, and at this time Perhaps, had such been in my daily sight I might have been indifferent thereto As Hermits are to tales of distant things. Hence for those rarities elaborate Having no relish yet, I was content With the more homely produce, rudely pil'd In this our coarser warehouse. At this day I smile in many a mountain solitude At passages and fragments that remain Of that inferior exhibition, play'd By wooden images, a theatre For Wake or Fair. And oftentimes do flit Remembrances before me of old Men, Old Humourists who have been long in their graves, And having almost in my mind put off Their human names, have into Phantoms pass'd Of texture midway betwixt life and books. I play the loiterer: 'tis enough to note That here, in dwarf proportions, were express'd The limbs of the great world, its goings on Collaterally pourtray'd, as in mock fight, A Tournament of blows, some hardly dealt, Though short of mortal combat; and whate'er Might in this pageant be suppos'd to hit An artless Rustic's notice, this way less, More that way, was not wasted upon me. —And yet this spectacle may well demand A more substantial name, no mimic shew, Itself a living part of a live whole, A creek of the vast sea. For all Degrees And Shapes of spurious fame and short-liv'd praise Here sate in state, and fed with daily alms Retainers won away from solid good; And here was Labour, his own Bond-slave, Hope That never set the pains against the prize, Idleness, halting with his weary clog, And poor misguided Shame, and witless Fear, And simple Pleasure, foraging for Death, Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray; Feuds, Factions, Flatteries, Enmity, and Guile; Murmuring Submission, and bald Government; The Idol weak as the Idolater; And Decency and Custom starving Truth; And blind Authority, beating with his Staff The Child that might have led him; Emptiness Followed, as of good omen; and meek Worth Left to itself unheard of, and unknown. Of these and other kindred notices I cannot say what portion is in truth The naked recollection of that time, And what may rather have been call'd to life By after-meditation. But delight, That, in an easy temper lull'd asleep, Is still with innocence its own reward, This surely was not wanting. Carelessly I gaz'd, roving as through a Cabinet Or wide Museum (throng'd with fishes, gems, Birds, crocodiles, shells) where little can be seen Well understood, or naturally endear'd, Yet still does every step bring something forth That quickens, pleases, stings; and here and there A casual rarity is singled out, And has its brief perusal, then gives way To others, all supplanted in their turn. Meanwhile, amid this gaudy Congress, fram'd Of things, by nature, most unneighbourly, The head turns round, and cannot right itself; And, though an aching and a barren sense Of gay confusion still be uppermost, With few wise longings and but little love, Yet something to the memory sticks at last, Whence profit may be drawn in times to come. Thus in submissive idleness, my Friend, The labouring time of Autumn, Winter, Spring, Nine months, roll'd pleasingly away; the tenth Return'd me to my native hills again. BOOK FOURTH SUMMER VACATION A pleasant sight it was when, having clomb The Heights of Kendal, and that dreary Moor Was cross'd, at length, as from a rampart's edge, I overlook'd the bed of Windermere. I bounded down the hill, shouting amain A lusty summons to the farther shore For the old Ferryman; and when he came I did not step into the well-known Boat Without a cordial welcome. Thence right forth I took my way, now drawing towards home, To that sweet Valley where I had been rear'd; 'Twas but a short hour's walk ere, veering round, I saw the snow-white Church upon its hill Sit like a thronèd Lady, sending out A gracious look all over its domain. Glad greetings had I, and some tears, perhaps, From my old Dame, so motherly and good; While she perus'd me with a Parent's pride. The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew Upon thy grave, good Creature! While my heart Can beat I never will forget thy name. Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest, After thy innocent and busy stir In narrow cares, thy little daily growth Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years, And more than eighty, of untroubled life, Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood Honour'd with little less than filial love. Great joy was mine to see thee once again, Thee and thy dwelling; and a throng of things About its narrow precincts all belov'd, And many of them seeming yet my own. Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts Have felt, and every man alive can guess? The rooms, the court, the garden were not left Long unsaluted, and the spreading Pine And broad stone Table underneath its boughs, Our summer seat in many a festive hour; And that unruly child of mountain birth, The froward Brook, which soon as he was box'd Within our Garden, found himself at once, As if by trick insidious and unkind, Stripp'd of his voice, and left to dimple down Without an effort and without a will, A channel paved by the hand of man. I look'd at him, and smil'd, and smil'd again, And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts, ‘Ha,’ quoth I, ‘pretty Prisoner, are you there!’ And now, reviewing soberly that hour, I marvel that a fancy did not flash Upon me, and a strong desire, straitway, At sight of such an emblem that shew'd forth So aptly my late course of even days And all their smooth enthralment, to pen down A satire on myself. My aged Dame Was with me, at my side: She guided me; I willing, nay—nay—wishing to be led. —The face of every neighbour whom I met Was as a volume to me; some I hail'd Far off, upon the road, or at their work, Unceremonious greetings, interchang'd With half the length of a long field between. Among my Schoolfellows I scatter'd round A salutation that was more constrain'd, Though earnest, doubtless with a little pride, But with more shame, for my habiliments, The transformation, and the gay attire. Delighted did I take my place again At our domestic Table: and, dear Friend! Relating simply as my wish hath been A Poet's history, can I leave untold The joy with which I laid me down at night In my accustomed bed, more welcome now Perhaps, than if it had been more desir'd Or been more often thought of with regret? That bed whence I had heard the roaring wind And clamorous rain, that bed where I, so oft, Had lain awake, on breezy nights, to watch The moon in splendour couch'd among the leaves Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood, Had watch'd her with fix'd eyes, while to and fro In the dark summit of the moving Tree She rock'd with every impulse of the wind. Among the faces which it pleas'd me well To see again, was one, by ancient right Our Inmate, a rough Terrier of the hills, By birth and call of Nature pre-ordain'd To hunt the badger, and unearth the fox, Among the impervious crags; but, having been From youth our own adopted, he had pass'd Into a gentler service. And when first The boyish spirit flagg'd, and day by day Along my veins I kindled with the stir, The fermentation and the vernal heat Of Poesy, affecting private shades Like a sick lover, then this Dog was used To watch me, an attendant and a friend Obsequious to my steps, early and late, Though often of such dilatory walk Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made. A hundred times when, in these wanderings, I have been busy with the toil of verse, Great pains and little progress, and at once Some fair enchanting image in my mind Rose up, full-form'd, like Venus from the sea Have I sprung forth towards him, and let loose My hand upon his back with stormy joy, Caressing him again, and yet again. And when, in the public roads at eventide I saunter'd, like a river murmuring And talking to itself, at such a season It was his custom to jog on before; But, duly, whensoever he had met A passenger approaching, would he turn To give me timely notice, and straitway, Punctual to such admonishment, I hush'd My voice, composed my gait, and shap'd myself To give and take a greeting that might save My name from piteous rumours, such as wait On men suspected to be craz'd in brain. Those walks, well worthy to be priz'd and lov'd, Regretted! that word, too, was on my tongue, But they were richly laden with all good, And cannot be remember'd but with thanks And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart, Those walks did now, like a returning spring, Come back on me again. When first I made Once more the circuit of our little Lake If ever happiness hath lodg'd with man, That day consummate happiness was mine, Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative. The sun was set, or setting, when I left Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on A sober hour, not winning or serene, For cold and raw the air was, and untun'd: But, as a face we love is sweetest then When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look It chance to wear is sweetest if the heart Have fulness in itself, even so with me It fared that evening. Gently did my soul Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood Naked as in the presence of her God. As on I walked, a comfort seem'd to touch A heart that had not been disconsolate, Strength came where weakness was not known to be, At least not felt; and restoration came, Like an intruder, knocking at the door Of unacknowledg'd weariness. I took The balance in my hand and weigh'd myself. I saw but little, and thereat was pleas'd; Little did I remember, and even this Still pleas'd me more; but I had hopes and peace And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed, Convers'd with promises, had glimmering views How Life pervades the undecaying mind, How the immortal Soul with God-like power Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep That time can lay upon her; how on earth, Man, if he do but live within the light Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad His being with a strength that cannot fail. Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love, Of innocence, and holiday repose; And more than pastoral quiet, in the heart Of amplest projects; and a peaceful end At last, or glorious, by endurance won. Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down, Alone, continuing there to muse: meanwhile The mountain heights were slowly overspread With darkness, and before a rippling breeze The long Lake lengthen'd out its hoary line; And in the shelter'd coppice where I sate, Around me, from among the hazel leaves, Now here, now there, stirr'd by the straggling wind, Came intermittingly a breath-like sound, A respiration short and quick, which oft, Yea, might I say, again and yet again, Mistaking for the panting of my Dog, The off and on Companion of my walk, I turn'd my head, to look if he were there. A freshness also found I at this time In human Life, the life I mean of those Whose occupations really I lov'd. The prospect often touch'd me with surprize, Crowded and full, and chang'd, as seem'd to me, Even as a garden in the heat of Spring, After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit The things which were the same and yet appear'd So different) amid this solitude, The little Vale where was my chief abode, 'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind To note, perhaps, some shelter'd Seat in which An old Man had been used to sun himself, Now empty; pale-fac'd Babes whom I had left In arms, known children of the neighbourhood, Now rosy prattlers, tottering up and down; And growing Girls whose beauty, filch'd away With all its pleasant promises, was gone To deck some slighted Playmate's homely cheek. Yes, I had something of another eye, And often, looking round, was mov'd to smiles, Such as a delicate work of humour breeds. I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts Of those plain-living People, in a sense Of love and knowledge; with another eye I saw the quiet Woodman in the Woods, The Shepherd on the Hills. With new delight, This chiefly, did I view my grey-hair'd Dame, Saw her go forth to Church, or other work Of state, equipp'd in monumental trim, Short Velvet Cloak (her Bonnet of the like) A Mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life, Affectionate without uneasiness, Her talk, her business pleas'd me, and no less Her clear though shallow stream of piety, That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course. With thoughts unfelt till now, I saw her read Her Bible on the Sunday afternoons; And lov'd the book, when she had dropp'd asleep, And made of it a pillow for her head. Nor less do I remember to have felt Distinctly manifested at this time A dawning, even as of another sense, A human-heartedness about my love For objects hitherto the gladsome air Of my own private being, and no more; Which I had loved, even as a blessed Spirit Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth, Might love, in individual happiness. But now there open'd on me other thoughts, Of change, congratulation, and regret, A new-born feeling. It spread far and wide; The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks; The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts, White Sirius, glittering o'er the southern crags, Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven, Acquaintances of every little child, And Jupiter, my own beloved Star. Whatever shadings of mortality Had fallen upon these objects heretofore Were different in kind; not tender: strong, Deep, gloomy were they and severe; the scatterings Of Childhood; and, moreover, had given way, In later youth, to beauty, and to love Enthusiastic, to delight and joy. As one who hangs down-bending from the side Of a slow-moving Boat, upon the breast Of a still water, solacing himself With such discoveries as his eye can make, Beneath him, in the bottom of the deeps, Sees many beauteous sights, weeds, fishes, flowers, Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more; Yet often is perplex'd, and cannot part The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky, Mountains and clouds, from that which is indeed The region, and the things which there abide In their true dwelling; now is cross'd by gleam Of his own image, by a sunbeam now, And motions that are sent he knows not whence, Impediments that make his task more sweet; —Such pleasant office have we long pursued Incumbent o'er the surface of past time With like success; nor have we often look'd On more alluring shows (to me, at least,) More soft, or less ambiguously descried, Than those which now we have been passing by, And where we still are lingering. Yet, in spite Of all these new employments of the mind, There was an inner falling-off. I loved, Loved deeply, all that I had loved before, More deeply even than ever; but a swarm Of heady thoughts jostling each other, gawds, And feast, and dance, and public revelry, And sports and games (less pleasing in themselves, Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh Of manliness and freedom) these did now Seduce me from the firm habitual quest Of feeding pleasures, from that eager zeal, Those yearnings which had every day been mine, A wild, unworldly-minded Youth, given up To Nature and to Books, or, at the most, From time to time, by inclination shipp'd, One among many, in societies, That were, or seem'd, as simple as myself. But now was come a change; it would demand Some skill, and longer time than may be spared, To paint, even to myself, these vanities, And how they wrought. But, sure it is that now Contagious air did oft environ me Unknown among these haunts in former days. The very garments that I wore appear'd To prey upon my strength, and stopp'd the course And quiet stream of self-forgetfulness. Something there was about me that perplex'd Th'authentic sight of reason, press'd too closely On that religious dignity of mind, That is the very faculty of truth; Which wanting, either, from the very first, A function never lighted up, or else Extinguish'd, Man, a creature great and good, Seems but a pageant plaything with vile claws And this great frame of breathing elements A senseless Idol. That vague heartless chace Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange For Books and Nature at that early age. 'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gain'd Of character or life; but at that time Of manners put to school I took small note; And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere. Far better had it been to exalt the mind By solitary study; to uphold Intense desire by thought and quietness. And yet, in chastisement of these regrets, The memory of one particular hour Doth here rise up against me. In a throng, A festal company of Maids and Youths, Old Men, and Matrons said, promiscuous rout, A medley of all tempers, I had pass'd The night in dancing, gaiety and mirth; With din of instruments, and shuffling feet, And glancing forms, and tapers glittering, And unaim'd prattle flying up and down, Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there Slight shocks of young love-liking interspers'd, That mounted up like joy into the head, And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired, The cock had crow'd, the sky was bright with day. Two miles I had to walk along the fields Before I reached my home. Magnificent The morning was, in memorable pomp, More glorious than I ever had beheld. The Sea was laughing at a distance; all The solid Mountains were as bright as clouds, Grain-tinctured, drench'd in empyrean light; And, in the meadows and the lower grounds, Was all the sweetness of a common dawn, Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, And Labourers going forth into the fields. —Ah! need I say, dear Friend, that to the brim My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows Were then made for me; bond unknown to me Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly, A dedicated Spirit. On I walk'd In blessedness, which even yet remains. Strange rendezvous my mind was at that time, A party-colour'd show of grave and gay, Solid and light, short-sighted and profound, Of inconsiderate habits and sedate, Consorting in one mansion unreprov'd. I knew the worth of that which I possess'd, Though slighted and misus'd. Besides, in truth, That Summer, swarming as it did with thoughts Transient and loose, yet wanted not a store Of primitive hours, when, by these hindrances Unthwarted, I experienc'd in myself Conformity as just as that of old To the end and written spirit of God's works, Whether held forth in Nature or in Man. From many wanderings that have left behind Remembrances not lifeless, I will here Single out one, then pass to other themes. A favourite pleasure hath it been with me, From time of earliest youth, to walk alone Along the public Way, when, for the night Deserted, in its silence it assumes A character of deeper quietness Than pathless solitudes. At such an hour Once, ere these summer months were pass'd away, I slowly mounted up a steep ascent Where the road's watery surface, to the ridge Of that sharp rising, glitter'd in the moon, And seem'd before my eyes another stream Creeping with silent lapse to join the brook That murmur'd in the valley. On I went Tranquil, receiving in my own despite Amusement, as I slowly pass'd along, From such near objects as from time to time, Perforce, intruded on the listless sense Quiescent, and dispos'd to sympathy, With an exhausted mind, worn out by toil, And all unworthy of the deeper joy Which waits on distant prospect, cliff, or sea, The dark blue vault, and universe of stars. Thus did I steal along that silent road, My body from the stillness drinking in A restoration like the calm of sleep, But sweeter far. Above, before, behind, Around me, all was peace and solitude, I look'd not round, nor did the solitude Speak to my eye; but it was heard and felt. O happy state! what beauteous pictures now Rose in harmonious imagery—they rose As from some distant region of my soul And came along like dreams; yet such as left Obscurely mingled with their passing forms A consciousness of animal delight, A self-possession felt in every pause And every gentle movement of my frame. While thus I wander'd, step by step led on, It chanc'd a sudden turning of the road Presented to my view an uncouth shape So near, that, slipping back into the shade Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well, Myself unseen. He was of stature tall, A foot above man's common measure tall, Stiff in his form, and upright, lank and lean; A man more meagre, as it seem'd to me, Was never seen abroad by night or day. His arms were long, and bare his hands; his mouth Shew'd ghastly in the moonlight: from behind A milestone propp'd him, and his figure seem'd Half-sitting, and half-standing. I could mark That he was clad in military garb, Though faded, yet entire. He was alone, Had no attendant, neither Dog, nor Staff, Nor knapsack; in his very dress appear'd A desolation, a simplicity That seem'd akin to solitude. Long time Did I peruse him with a mingled sense Of fear and sorrow. From his lips, meanwhile, There issued murmuring sounds, as if of pain Or of uneasy thought; yet still his form Kept the same steadiness; and at his feet His shadow lay, and mov'd not. In a Glen Hard by, a Village stood, whose roofs and doors Were visible among the scatter'd trees, Scarce distant from the spot an arrow's flight; I wish'd to see him move; but he remain'd Fix'd to his place, and still from time to time Sent forth a murmuring voice of dead complaint, Groans scarcely audible. Without self-blame I had not thus prolong'd my watch; and now, Subduing my heart's specious cowardise I left the shady nook where I had stood, And hail'd him. Slowly from his resting-place He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm In measur'd gesture lifted to his head, Return'd my salutation; then resum'd His station as before: and when, erelong, I ask'd his history, he in reply Was neither slow nor eager; but unmov'd, And with a quiet, uncomplaining voice, A stately air of mild indifference, He told, in simple words, a Soldier's tale, That in the Tropic Islands he had serv'd, Whence he had landed, scarcely ten days past, That on his landing he had been dismiss'd, And now was travelling to his native home. At this, I turn'd and looked towards the Village But all were gone to rest; the fires all out; And every silent window to the Moon Shone with a yellow glitter. ‘No one there,’ Said I, ‘is waking, we must measure back The way which we have come: behind yon wood A Labourer dwells; and, take it on my word He will not murmur should we break his rest; And with a ready heart will give you food And lodging for the night.’ At this he stoop'd, And from the ground took up an oaken Staff, By me yet unobserved, a traveller's Staff; Which, I suppose, from his slack hand had dropp'd, And lain till now neglected in the grass. Towards the Cottage without more delay We shap'd our course; as it appear'd to me, He travell'd without pain, and I beheld With ill-suppress'd astonishment his tall And ghastly figure moving at my side; Nor, while we journey'd thus could I forbear To question him of what he had endur'd From hardship, battle, or the pestilence. He, all the while, was in demeanour calm, Concise in answer; solemn and sublime He might have seem'd, but that in all he said There was a strange half-absence, and a tone Of weakness and indifference, as of one Remembering the importance of his theme But feeling it no longer. We advanced Slowly, and, ere we to the wood were come Discourse had ceas'd. Together on we pass'd, In silence, through the shades, gloomy and dark; Then, turning up along an open field We gain'd the Cottage. At the door I knock'd, Calling aloud ‘my Friend, here is a Man By sickness overcome; beneath your roof This night let him find rest, and give him food, If food he need, for he is faint and tired.’ Assur'd that now my Comrade would repose In comfort, I entreated that henceforth He would not linger in the public ways But ask for timely furtherance and help Such as his state requir'd. At this reproof, With the same ghastly mildness in his look He said ‘my trust is in the God of Heaven And in the eye of him that passes me.’ The Cottage door was speedily unlock'd, And now the Soldier touch'd his hat again With his lean hand; and in a voice that seem'd To speak with a reviving interest, Till then unfelt, he thank'd me; I return'd The blessing of the poor unhappy Man; And so we parted. Back I cast a look, And linger'd near the door a little space; Then sought with quiet heart my distant home. BOOK FIFTH BOOKS Even in the steadiest mood of reason, when All sorrow for thy transitory pains Goes out, it grieves me for thy state, O Man, Thou paramount Creature! and thy race, while ye Shall sojourn on this planet; not for woes Which thou endur'st; that weight, albeit huge, I charm away; but for those palms atchiev'd Through length of time, by study and hard thought, The honours of thy high endowments, there My sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto, In progress through this Verse, my mind hath look'd Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven As her prime Teacher, intercourse with man Establish'd by the sovereign Intellect, Who through that bodily Image hath diffus'd A soul divine which we participate, A deathless spirit. Thou also, Man, hast wrought, For commerce of thy nature with itself, Things worthy of unconquerable life; And yet we feel, we cannot chuse but feel That these must perish. Tremblings of the heart It gives, to think that the immortal being No more shall need such garments; and yet Man, As long as he shall be the Child of Earth, Might almost ‘weep to have’ what he may lose, Nor be himself extinguish'd; but survive Abject, depress'd, forlorn, disconsolate. A thought is with me sometimes, and I say, Should earth by inward throes be wrench'd throughout, Or fire be sent from far to wither all Her pleasant habitations, and dry up Old Ocean in his bed left sing'd and bare, Yet would the living Presence still subsist Victorious; and composure would ensue, And kindlings like the morning; presage sure, Though slow, perhaps, of a returning day. But all the meditations of mankind, Yea, all the adamantine holds of truth, By reason built, or passion, which itself Is highest reason in a soul sublime; The consecrated works of Bard and Sage, Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men, Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes, Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the mind Some element to stamp her image on In nature somewhat nearer to her own? Why, gifted with such powers to send abroad Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail? One day, when in the hearing of a Friend, I had given utterance to thoughts like these, He answer'd with a smile that, in plain truth 'Twas going far to seek disquietude; But on the front of his reproof, confess'd That he, at sundry seasons, had himself Yielded to kindred hauntings. And forthwith Added, that once upon a summer's noon, While he was sitting in a rocky cave By the sea-side, perusing, as it chanced, The famous History of the Errant Knight Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts Came to him; and to height unusual rose While listlessly he sate, and having closed The Book, had turned his eyes towards the Sea. On Poetry and geometric Truth, The knowledge that endures, upon these two, And their high privilege of lasting life, Exempt from all internal injury, He mused; upon these chiefly: and at length, His senses yielding to the sultry air, Sleep seiz'd him, and he pass'd into a dream. He saw before him an Arabian Waste, A Desart; and he fancied that himself Was sitting there in the wide wilderness, Alone, upon the sands. Distress of mind Was growing in him when, behold! at once To his great joy a Man was at his side, Upon a dromedary, mounted high. He seem'd an Arab of the Bedouin Tribes, A Lance he bore, and underneath one arm A Stone; and, in the opposite hand, a Shell Of a surpassing brightness. Much rejoic'd The dreaming Man that he should have a Guide To lead him through the Desart; and he thought, While questioning himself what this strange freight Which the Newcomer carried through the Waste Could mean, the Arab told him that the Stone, To give it in the language of the Dream, Was Euclid's Elements; ‘and this,’ said he, ‘This other,’ pointing to the Shell, ‘this Book Is something of more worth.’ And, at the word, The Stranger, said my Friend continuing, Stretch'd forth the Shell towards me, with command That I should hold it to my ear; I did so, And heard that instant in an unknown Tongue, Which yet I understood, articulate sounds, A loud prophetic blast of harmony, An Ode, in passion utter'd, which foretold Destruction to the Children of the Earth, By deluge now at hand. No sooner ceas'd The Song, but with calm look, the Arab said That all was true; that it was even so As had been spoken; and that he himself Was going then to bury those two Books: The one that held acquaintance with the stars, And wedded man to man by purest bond Of nature, undisturbed by space or time; Th'other that was a God, yea many Gods, Had voices more than all the winds, and was A joy, a consolation, and a hope. My friend continued, ‘strange as it may seem, I wonder'd not, although I plainly saw The one to be a Stone, th'other a Shell, Nor doubted once but that they both were Books, Having a perfect faith in all that pass'd. A wish was now ingender'd in my fear To cleave unto this Man, and I begg'd leave To share his errand with him. On he pass'd Not heeding me; I follow'd, and took note That he look'd often backward with wild look, Grasping his twofold treasure to his side. —Upon a Dromedary, Lance in rest, He rode, I keeping pace with him, and now I fancied that he was the very Knight Whose Tale Cervantes tells, yet not the Knight, But was an Arab of the Desart, too; Of these was neither, and was both at once. His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturb'd, And, looking backwards when he look'd, I saw A glittering light, and ask'd him whence it came. ‘It is,’ said he, ‘the waters of the deep Gathering upon us,’ quickening then his pace He left me: I call'd after him aloud; He heeded not; but with his twofold charge Beneath his arm, before me full in view I saw him riding o'er the Desart Sands, With the fleet waters of the drowning world In chase of him, whereat I wak'd in terror, And saw the Sea before me; and the Book, In which I had been reading, at my side. Full often, taking from the world of sleep This Arab Phantom, which my Friend beheld, This Semi-Quixote, I to him have given A substance, fancied him a living man, A gentle Dweller in the Desart, craz'd By love and feeling and internal thought, Protracted among endless solitudes; Have shap'd him, in the oppression of his brain, Wandering upon this quest, and thus equipp'd. And I have scarcely pitied him; have felt A reverence for a Being thus employ'd; And thought that in the blind and awful lair Of such a madness, reason did lie couch'd. Enow there are on earth to take in charge Their Wives, their Children, and their virgin Loves, Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear; Enow to think of these; yea, will I say, In sober contemplation of the approach Of such great overthrow, made manifest By certain evidence, that I, methinks, Could share that Maniac's anxiousness, could go Upon like errand. Oftentimes, at least, Me hath such deep entrancement half-possess'd, When I have held a volume in my hand Poor earthly casket of immortal Verse! Shakespeare, or Milton, Labourers divine! Mighty indeed, supreme must be the power Of living Nature, which could thus so long Detain me from the best of other thoughts. Even in the lisping time of Infancy, And later down, in prattling Childhood, even While I was travelling back among those days, How could I ever play an ingrate's part? Once more should I have made those bowers resound, And intermingled strains of thankfulness With their own thoughtless melodies; at least, It might have well beseem'd me to repeat Some simply fashion'd tale; to tell again, In slender accents of sweet Verse, some tale That did bewitch me then, and soothes me now. O Friend! O Poet! Brother of my soul, Think not that I could ever pass along Untouch'd by these remembrances; no, no, But I was hurried forward by a stream, And could not stop. Yet wherefore should I speak, Why call upon a few weak words to say What is already written in the hearts Of all that breathe? what in the path of all Drops daily from the tongue of every child, Wherever Man is found. The trickling tear Upon the cheek of listening Infancy Tells it, and the insuperable look That drinks as if it never could be full. That portion of my story I shall leave There register'd: whatever else there be Of power or pleasure, sown or fostered thus, Peculiar to myself, let that remain Where it lies hidden in its endless home Among the depths of time. And yet it seems That here, in memory of all books which lay Their sure foundations in the heart of Man; Whether by native prose or numerous verse, That in the name of all inspirèd Souls, From Homer, the great Thunderer; from the voice Which roars along the bed of Jewish Song; And that, more varied and elaborate, Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake Our Shores in England; from those loftiest notes Down to the low and wren-like warblings, made For Cottages and Spinners at the wheel, And weary Travellers when they rest themselves By the highways and hedges; ballad tunes, Food for the hungry ears of little Ones, And of old Men who have surviv'd their joy; It seemeth, in behalf of these, the works And of the Men who fram'd them, whether known, Or sleeping nameless in their scatter'd graves, That I should here assert their rights, attest Their honours; and should, once for all, pronounce Their benediction; speak of them as Powers For ever to be hallowed; only less, For what we may become, and what we need, Than Nature's self, which is the breath of God. Rarely, and with reluctance, would I stoop To transitory themes; yet I rejoice, And, by these thoughts admonish'd, must speak out Thanksgivings from my heart, that I was rear'd Safe from an evil which these days have laid Upon the Children of the Land, a pest That might have dried me up, body and soul. This Verse is dedicate to Nature's self, And things that teach as Nature teaches, then Oh where had been the Man, the Poet where? Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend, If we, in lieu of wandering, as we did, Through heights and hollows, and bye-spots of tales Rich with indigenous produce, open ground Of Fancy, happy pastures rang'd at will! Had been attended, follow'd, watch'd, and noos'd, Each in his several melancholy walk String'd like a poor man's Heifer, at its feed Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude; Or rather like a stalled ox shut out From touch of growing grass; that may not taste A flower till it have yielded up its sweets A prelibation to the mower's scythe. Behold the Parent Hen amid her Brood, Though fledged and feather'd, and well pleased to part And straggle from her presence, still a Brood, And she herself from the maternal bond Still undischarged; yet doth she little more Than move with them in tenderness and love, A centre of the circle which they make; And, now and then, alike from need of theirs, And call of her own natural appetites, She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food Which they partake at pleasure. Early died My honour'd Mother; she who was the heart And hinge of all our learnings and our loves: She left us destitute, and as we might Trooping together. Little suits it me To break upon the sabbath of her rest With any thought that looks at others' blame, Nor would I praise her but in perfect love. Hence am I check'd: but I will boldly say, In gratitude, and for the sake of truth, Unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught, Fetching her goodness rather from times past Than shaping novelties from those to come, Had no presumption, no such jealousy; Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust Our Nature; but had virtual faith that he, Who fills the Mother's breasts with innocent milk, Doth also for our nobler part provide, Under his great correction and controul, As innocent instincts, and as innocent food. This was her creed, and therefore she was pure From feverish dread of error or mishap And evil, overweeningly so call'd; Was not puff'd up by false unnatural hopes; Nor selfish with unnecessary cares; Nor with impatience from the season ask'd More than its timely produce; rather lov'd The hours for what they are than from regards Glanced on their promises in restless pride. Such was she; not from faculties more strong Than others have, but from the times, perhaps, And spot in which she liv'd, and through a grace Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness, A heart that found benignity and hope, Being itself benign. My drift hath scarcely, I fear, been obvious; for I have recoil'd From showing as it is the monster birth Engender'd by these too industrious times. Let few words paint it: 'tis a Child, no Child, But a dwarf Man; in knowledge, virtue, skill; In what he is not, and in what he is, The noontide shadow of a man complete A worshipper of worldly seemliness, Not quarrelsome; for that were far beneath His dignity; with gifts he bubbles o'er As generous as a fountain; selfishness May not come near him, gluttony or pride; The wandering Beggars propagate his name, Dumb creatures find him tender as a Nun. Yet deem him not for this a naked dish Of goodness merely, he is garnish'd out. Arch are his notices, and nice his sense Of the ridiculous; deceit and guile Meanness and falsehood he detests, can treat With apt and graceful laughter; nor is blind To the broad follies of the licens'd world; Though shrewd, yet innocent himself withal And can read lectures upon innocence. He is fenc'd round, nay arm'd, for aught we know In panoply complete; and fear itself, Natural or supernatural alike, Unless it leap upon him in a dream, Touches him not. Briefly, the moral part Is perfect, and in learning and in books He is a prodigy. His discourse moves slow, Massy and ponderous as a prison door, Tremendously emboss'd with terms of art; Rank growth of propositions overruns The Stripling's brain; the path in which he treads Is chok'd with grammars; cushion of Divine Was never such a type of thought profound As is the pillow where he rests his head. The Ensigns of the Empire which he holds, The globe and sceptre of his royalties Are telescopes, and crucibles, and maps. Ships he can guide across the pathless sea, And tell you all their cunning; he can read The inside of the earth, and spell the stars; He knows the policies of foreign Lands; Can string you names of districts, cities, towns, The whole world over, tight as beads of dew Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs; Takes nothing upon trust. His Teachers stare The Country People pray for God's good grace, And tremble at his deep experiments. All things are put to question; he must live Knowing that he grows wiser every day, Or else not live at all; and seeing, too, Each little drop of wisdom as it falls Into the dimpling cistern of his heart; Meanwhile old Grandame Earth is grieved to find The playthings, which her love design'd for him, Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowers Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn. Now this is hollow, 'tis a life of lies From the beginning, and in lies must end. Forth bring him to the air of common sense, And, fresh and shewy as it is, the Corpse Slips from us into powder. Vanity That is his soul, there lives he, and there moves; It is the soul of every thing he seeks; That gone, nothing is left which he can love. Nay, if a thought of purer birth should rise To carry him towards a better clime Some busy helper still is on the watch To drive him back and pound him like a Stray Within the pinfold of his own conceit; Which is his home, his natural dwelling place. Oh! give us once again the Wishing-Cap Of Fortunatus, and the invisible Coat Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood, And Sabra in the forest with St. George! The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap One precious gain, that he forgets himself. These mighty workmen of our later age Who with a broad highway have overbridged The froward chaos of futurity, Tam'd to their bidding; they who have the skill To manage books, and things, and make them work Gently on infant minds, as does the sun Upon a flower; the Tutors of our Youth The Guides, the Wardens of our faculties, And Stewards of our labour, watchful men And skilful in the usury of time, Sages, who in their prescience would controul All accidents, and to the very road Which they have fashion'd would confine us down, Like engines, when will they be taught That in the unreasoning progress of the world A wiser Spirit is at work for us, A better eye than theirs, more prodigal Of blessings, and more studious of our good, Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours? There was a Boy, ye knew him well, ye Cliffs And Islands of Winander! many a time At evening, when the stars had just begun To move along the edges of the hills, Rising or setting, would he stand alone Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering Lake, And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands Press'd closely, palm to palm, and to his mouth Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls That they might answer him.—And they would shout Across the watery Vale, and shout again, Responsive to his call, with quivering peals, And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild Of mirth and jocund din! And when it chanced That pauses of deep silence mock'd his skill, Then sometimes, in that silence, while he hung Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprize Has carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, Its woods, and that uncertain Heaven, receiv'd Into the bosom of the steady Lake. This Boy was taken from his Mates, and died In childhood, ere he was full ten years old. —Fair are the woods, and beauteous is the spot, The Vale where he was born; the Churchyard hangs Upon a Slope above the Village School, And there, along that bank, when I have pass'd At evening, I believe that oftentimes A full half-hour together I have stood Mute—looking at the Grave in which he lies. Even now before my sight, methinks, I have That self-same Village Church; I see her sit, (The thronèd Lady spoken of erewhile On her green hill; forgetful of this Boy Who slumbers at her feet; forgetful, too, Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves, And listening only to the gladsome sounds That, from the rural School ascending, play Beneath her and about her. May she long Behold a race of young Ones like to those With whom I herded! (easily, indeed, We might have fed upon a fatter soil Of Arts and Letters, but be that forgiven) A race of real children, not too wise, Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh, And bandied up and down by love and hate, Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy; Mad at their sports like wither'd leaves in winds; Though doing wrong, and suffering, and full oft Bending beneath our life's mysterious weight Of pain and fear; yet still in happiness Not yielding to the happiest upon earth. Simplicity in habit, truth in speech, Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds! May books and nature be their early joy! And knowledge, rightly honor'd with that name, Knowledge not purchas'd with the loss of power! Well do I call to mind the very week When I was first entrusted to the care Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores, And brooks, were like a dream of novelty To my half-infant thoughts; that very week While I was roving up and down alone, Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears, Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake: Twilight was coming on; yet through the gloom, I saw distinctly on the opposite Shore A heap of garments, left, as I suppos'd, By one who there was bathing; long I watch'd, But no one own'd them; meanwhile the calm Lake Grew dark, with all the shadows on its breast, And, now and then, a fish up-leaping, snapp'd The breathless stillness. The succeeding day, (Those unclaimed garments telling a plain Tale) Went there a Company, and, in their Boat Sounded with grappling irons, and long poles. At length, the dead Man, 'mid that beauteous scene Of trees, and hills and water, bolt upright Rose with his ghastly face; a spectre shape Of terror even! and yet no vulgar fear, Young as I was, a Child not nine years old, Possess'd me; for my inner eye had seen Such sights before, among the shining streams Of Fairy land, the Forests of Romance: Hence came a spirit hallowing what I saw With decoration and ideal grace; A dignity, a smoothness, like the works Of Grecian Art, and purest Poesy. I had a precious treasure at that time A little, yellow canvas-cover'd Book, A slender abstract of the Arabian Tales; And when I learn'd, as now I first did learn, From my Companions in this new abode, That this dear prize of mine was but a block Hewn from a mighty quarry; in a word, That there were four large Volumes, laden all With kindred matter, 'twas, in truth, to me A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly I made a league, a covenant with a Friend Of my own age, that we should lay aside The monies we possess'd, and hoard up more, Till our joint savings had amass'd enough To make this Book our own. Through several months Religiously did we preserve that vow, And spite of all temptation, hoarded up And hoarded up; but firmness fail'd at length Nor were we ever masters of our wish. And afterwards, when to my Father's House Returning at the holidays, I found That golden store of books which I had left Open to my enjoyment once again What heart was mine! Full often through the course Of those glad respites in the summer-time When, arm'd with rod and line we went abroad For a whole day together, I have lain Down by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring Stream, On the hot stones and in the glaring sun, And there have read, devouring as I read, Defrauding the day's glory, desperate! Till, with a sudden bound of smart reproach, Such as an Idler deals with in his shame, I to the sport betook myself again. A gracious Spirit o'er this earth presides, And o'er the heart of man: invisibly It comes, directing those to works of love Who care not, know not, think not what they do: The Tales that charm away the wakeful night In Araby, Romances, Legends, penn'd For solace, by the light of monkish Lamps; Fictions for Ladies, of their Love, devis'd By youthful Squires; adventures endless, spun By the dismantled Warrior in old age, Out of the bowels of those very thoughts In which his youth did first extravagate, These spread like day, and something in the shape Of these, will live till man shall be no more. Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites are ours, And they must have their food: our childhood sits, Our simple childhood sits upon a throne That hath more power than all the elements. I guess not what this tells of Being past, Nor what it augurs of the life to come; But so it is; and in that dubious hour, That twilight when we first begin to see This dawning earth, to recognise, expect; And in the long probation that ensues, The time of trial, ere we learn to live In reconcilement with our stinted powers, To endure this state of meagre vassalage; Unwilling to forego, confess, submit, Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows To custom, mettlesome, and not yet tam'd And humbled down, oh! then we feel, we feel, We know when we have Friends. Ye dreamers, then, Forgers of lawless tales! we bless you then, Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape Philosophy will call you: then we feel With what, and how great might ye are in league, Who make our wish our power, our thought a deed, An empire, a possession; Ye whom Time And Seasons serve; all Faculties; to whom Earth crouches, th'elements are potter's clay, Space like a Heaven fill'd up with Northern lights; Here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once. It might demand a more ambitious strain To tell of later pleasures, link'd to these, A tract of the same isthmus which we cross In progress from our native continent To earth and human life; I mean to speak Of that delightful time of growing youth When cravings for the marvellous relent, And we begin to love what we have seen; And sober truth, experience, sympathy, Take stronger hold of us; and words themselves Move us with conscious pleasure. I am sad At thought of raptures, now for ever flown, Even unto tears, I sometimes could be sad To think of, to read over, many a page, Poems withal of name, which at that time Did never fail to entrance me, and are now Dead in my eyes as is a theatre Fresh emptied of spectators. Thirteen years Or haply less, I might have seen, when first My ears began to open to the charm Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet For their own sakes, a passion and a power; And phrases pleas'd me, chosen for delight, For pomp, or love. Oft in the public roads, Yet unfrequented, while the morning light Was yellowing the hill-tops, with that dear Friend The same whom I have mention'd heretofore, I went abroad, and for the better part Of two delightful hours we stroll'd along By the still borders of the misty Lake, Repeating favourite verses with one voice, Or conning more; as happy as the birds That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad, Lifted above the ground by airy fancies More bright than madness or the dreams of wine, And, though full oft the objects of our love Were false, and in their splendour overwrought, Yet, surely, at such time no vulgar power Was working in us, nothing less, in truth, Than that most noble attribute of man, Though yet untutor'd and inordinate, That wish for something loftier, more adorn'd, Than is the common aspect, daily garb Of human life. What wonder then if sounds Of exultation echoed through the groves! For images, and sentiments, and words, And every thing with which we had to do In that delicious world of poesy, Kept holiday; a never-ending show, With music, incense, festival, and flowers! Here must I pause: this only will I add, From heart-experience, and in humblest sense Of modesty, that he, who, in his youth A wanderer among the woods and fields, With living Nature hath been intimate, Not only in that raw unpractis'd time Is stirr'd to ecstasy, as others are, By glittering verse; but, he doth furthermore, In measure only dealt out to himself, Receive enduring touches of deep joy From the great Nature that exists in works Of mighty Poets. Visionary Power Attends upon the motions of the winds Embodied in the mystery of words. There darkness makes abode, and all the host Of shadowy things do work their changes there, As in a mansion like their proper home; Even forms and substances are circumfused By that transparent veil with light divine; And through the turnings intricate of Verse, Present themselves as objects recognis'd, In flashes, and with a glory scarce their own. Thus far a scanty record is deduced Of what I owed to Books in early life; Their later influence yet remains untold; But as this work was taking in my thoughts Proportions that seem'd larger than had first Been meditated, I was indisposed To any further progress at a time When these acknowledgements were left unpaid. BOOK SIXTH CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS The leaves were yellow when to Furness Fells, The haunt of Shepherds, and to cottage life I bade adieu; and, one among the Flock Who by that season are conven'd, like birds Trooping together at the Fowler's lure, Went back to Granta's cloisters; not so fond, Or eager, though as gay and undepress'd In spirit, as when I thence had taken flight A few short months before. I turn'd my face Without repining from the mountain pomp Of Autumn, and its beauty enter'd in With calmer Lakes, and louder Streams; and You, Frank-hearted Maids of rocky Cumberland, You and your not unwelcome days of mirth I quitted, and your nights of revelry, And in my own unlovely Cell sate down In lightsome mood; such privilege has Youth, That cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts. We need not linger o'er the ensuing time, But let me add at once that, now the bonds Of indolent and vague society Relaxing in their hold, I liv'd henceforth More to myself, read more, reflected more, Felt more, and settled daily into habits More promising. Two winters may be pass'd Without a separate notice; many books Were read in process of this time, devour'd, Tasted or skimm'd, or studiously perus'd, But with no settled plan. I was detached Internally from academic cares, From every hope of prowess and reward, And wish'd to be a lodger in that house Of Letters, and no more: and should have been Even such, but for some personal concerns That hung about me in my own despite Perpetually, no heavy weight, but still A baffling and a hindrance, a controul Which made the thought of planning for myself A course of independent study seem An act of disobedience towards them Who lov'd me, proud rebellion and unkind. This bastard virtue, rather let it have A name it more deserves, this cowardice, Gave treacherous sanction to that overlove Of freedom planted in me from the very first And indolence, by force of which I turn'd From regulations even of my own, As from restraints and bonds. And who can tell, Who knows what thus may have been gain'd both then And at a later season, or preserv'd; What love of nature, what original strength Of contemplation, what intuitive truths The deepest and the best, and what research Unbiass'd, unbewilder'd, and unaw'd? The Poet's soul was with me at that time, Sweet meditations, the still overflow Of happiness and truth. A thousand hopes Were mine, a thousand tender dreams, of which No few have since been realiz'd, and some Do yet remain, hopes for my future life. Four years and thirty, told this very week, Have I been now a sojourner on earth, And yet the morning gladness is not gone Which then was in my mind. Those were the days Which also first encourag'd me to trust With firmness, hitherto but lightly touch'd With such a daring thought, that I might leave Some monument behind me which pure hearts Should reverence. The instinctive humbleness, Upheld even by the very name and thought Of printed books and authorship, began To melt away, and further, the dread awe Of mighty names was soften'd down, and seem'd Approachable, admitting fellowship Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now, Though not familiarly, my mind put on; I lov'd, and I enjoy'd, that was my chief And ruling business, happy in the strength And loveliness of imagery and thought. All winter long, whenever free to take My choice, did I at night frequent our Groves And tributary walks, the last, and oft The only one, who had been lingering there Through hours of silence, till the Porter's Bell, A punctual follower on the stroke of nine, Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice, Inexorable summons. Lofty Elms, Inviting shades of opportune recess, Did give composure to a neighbourhood Unpeaceful in itself. A single Tree There was, no doubt yet standing there, an Ash With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreath'd; Up from the ground and almost to the top The trunk and master branches everywhere Were green with ivy; and the lightsome twigs And outer spray profusely tipp'd with seeds That hung in yellow tassels and festoons, Moving or still, a Favourite trimm'd out By Winter for himself, as if in pride, And with outlandish grace. Oft have I stood Foot-bound, uplooking at this lovely Tree Beneath a frosty moon. The hemisphere Of magic fiction, verse of mine perhaps May never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self Could have more tranquil visions in his youth, More bright appearances could scarcely see Of human Forms with superhuman Powers, Than I beheld, standing on winter nights Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth. 'Twould be a waste of labour to detail The rambling studies of a truant Youth, Which further may be easily divin'd, What, and what kind they were. My inner knowledge, (This barely will I note) was oft in depth And delicacy like another mind Sequester'd from my outward taste in books, And yet the books which then I lov'd the most Are dearest to me now; for, being vers'd In living Nature, I had there a guide Which open'd frequently my eyes, else shut, A standard which was usefully applied, Even when unconsciously, to other things Which less I understood. In general terms, I was a better judge of thoughts than words, Misled as to these latter, not alone By common inexperience of youth But by the trade in classic niceties, Delusion to young Scholars incident And old ones also, by that overpriz'd And dangerous craft of picking phrases out From languages that want the living voice To make of them a nature to the heart, To tell us what is passion, what is truth, What reason, what simplicity and sense. Yet must I not entirely overlook The pleasure gather'd from the elements Of geometric science. I had stepp'd In these inquiries but a little way, No farther than the threshold; with regret Sincere I mention this; but there I found Enough to exalt, to chear me and compose. With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance Which even was cherish'd, did I meditate Upon the alliance of those simple, pure Proportions and relations with the frame And Laws of Nature, how they would become Herein a leader to the human mind, And made endeavours frequent to detect The process by dark guesses of my own. Yet from this source more frequently I drew A pleasure calm and deeper, a still sense Of permanent and universal sway And paramount endowment in the mind, An image not unworthy of the one Surpassing Life, which out of space and time, Nor touched by welterings of passion, is And hath the name of God. Transcendent peace And silence did await upon these thoughts That were a frequent comfort to my youth. And as I have read of one by shipwreck thrown With fellow Sufferers whom the waves had spar'd Upon a region uninhabited An island of the Deep, who having brought To land a single Volume and no more, A treatise of Geometry, was used, Although of food and clothing destitute, And beyond common wretchedness depress'd, To part from company and take this book, Then first a self-taught pupil in those truths, To spots remote and corners of the Isle By the sea side, and draw his diagrams With a long stick upon the sand, and thus Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost Forget his feeling; even so, if things Producing like effect, from outward cause So different, may rightly be compar'd, So was it with me then, and so will be With Poets ever. Mighty is the charm Of those abstractions to a mind beset With images, and haunted by itself; And specially delightful unto me Was that clear Synthesis built up aloft So gracefully, even then when it appear'd No more than as a plaything, or a toy Embodied to the sense, not what it is In verity, an independent world Created out of pure Intelligence. Such dispositions then were mine, almost Through grace of Heaven and inborn tenderness. And not to leave the picture of that time Imperfect, with these habits I must rank A melancholy from humours of the blood In part, and partly taken up, that lov'd A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds, The twilight more than dawn, Autumn than Spring; A treasur'd and luxurious gloom, of choice And inclination mainly, and the mere Redundancy of youth's contentedness. Add unto this a multitude of hours Pilfer'd away by what the Bard who sang Of the Enchanter Indolence hath call'd ‘Good-natured lounging,’ and behold a map Of my Collegiate life, far less intense Than Duty call'd for, or without regard To Duty, might have sprung up of itself By change of accidents, or even, to speak Without unkindness, in another place. In summer among distant nooks I rov'd Dovedale, or Yorkshire Dales, or through bye-tracts Of my own native region, and was blest Between these sundry wanderings with a joy Above all joys, that seem'd another morn Risen on mid noon, the presence, Friend, I mean Of that sole Sister, she who hath been long Thy Treasure also, thy true friend and mine, Now, after separation desolate Restor'd to me, such absence that she seem'd A gift then first bestow'd. The gentle Banks Of Emont, hitherto unnam'd in Song, And that monastic Castle, on a Flat Low-standing by the margin of the Stream, A Mansion not unvisited of old By Sidney, where, in sight of our Helvellyn, Some snatches he might pen, for aught we know, Of his Arcadia, by fraternal love Inspir'd; that River and that mouldering Dome Have seen us sit in many a summer hour, My sister and myself, when having climb'd In danger through some window's open space, We look'd abroad, or on the Turret's head Lay listening to the wild flowers and the grass, As they gave out their whispers to the wind. Another Maid there was, who also breath'd A gladness o'er that season, then to me By her exulting outside look of youth And placid under-countenance, first endear'd, That other Spirit, Coleridge, who is now So near to us, that meek confiding heart, So reverenced by us both. O'er paths and fields In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanes Of eglantine, and through the shady woods, And o'er the Border Beacon, and the Waste Of naked Pools, and common Crags that lay Expos'd on the bare Fell, was scatter'd love, A spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam. O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time; And yet a power is on me and a strong Confusion, and I seem to plant Thee there. Far art Thou wander'd now in search of health, And milder breezes, melancholy lot! But Thou art with us, with us in the past, The present, with us in the times to come: There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair, No languor, no dejection, no dismay, No absence scarcely can there be for those Who love as we do. Speed Thee well! divide Thy pleasure with us, thy returning strength Receive it daily as a joy of ours; Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift Of gales Etesian, or of loving thoughts. I, too, have been a Wanderer; but, alas! How different is the fate of different men Though Twins almost in genius and in mind! Unknown unto each other, yea, and breathing As if in different elements, we were framed To bend at last to the same discipline, Predestin'd, if two Beings ever were, To seek the same delights, and have one health, One happiness. Throughout this narrative, Else sooner ended, I have known full well For whom I thus record the birth and growth Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth, And joyous loves that hallow innocent days Of peace and self-command. Of Rivers, Fields, And Groves, I speak to Thee, my Friend; to Thee, Who, yet a liveried School-Boy, in the depths Of the huge City, on the leaded Roof Of that wide Edifice, thy Home and School, Wast used to lie and gaze upon the clouds Moving in Heaven; or haply, tired of this, To shut thine eyes, and by internal light See trees, and meadows, and thy native Stream Far distant, thus beheld from year to year Of thy long exile. Nor could I forget In this late portion of my argument That scarcely had I finally resign'd My rights among those academic Bowers When Thou wert thither guided. From the heart Of London, and from Cloisters there Thou cam'st, And didst sit down in temperance and peace, A rigorous Student. What a stormy course Then follow'd. Oh! it is a pang that calls For utterance, to think how small a change Of circumstances might to Thee have spared A world of pain, ripen'd ten thousand hopes For ever wither'd. Through this retrospect Of my own College life I still have had Thy after sojourn in the self-same place Present before my eyes; I have play'd with times, (I speak of private business of the thought) And accidents as children do with cards, Or as a man, who, when his house is built, A frame lock'd up in wood and stone, doth still, In impotence of mind, by his fireside Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought Of Thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence And all the strength and plumage of thy Youth, Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse Among the Schoolmen, and platonic forms Of wild ideal pageantry, shap'd out From things well-match'd, or ill, and words for things, The self-created sustenance of a mind Debarr'd from Nature's living images, Compell'd to be a life unto itself, And unrelentingly possess'd by thirst Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone, Ah! surely not in singleness of heart Should I have seen the light of evening fade Upon the silent Cam, if we had met, Even at that early time; I needs must hope, Must feel, must trust, that my maturer age, And temperature less willing to be mov'd, My calmer habits and more steady voice Would with an influence benign have sooth'd Or chas'd away the airy wretchedness That batten'd on thy youth. But thou hast trod, In watchful meditation thou hast trod A march of glory, which doth put to shame These vain regrets; health suffers in thee; else Such grief for Thee would be the weakest thought That ever harbour'd in the breast of Man. A passing word erewhile did lightly touch On wanderings of my own; and now to these My Poem leads me with an easier mind. The employments of three winters when I wore A student's gown have been already told, Or shadow'd forth, as far as there is need. When the third summer brought its liberty A Fellow Student and myself, he, too, A Mountaineer, together sallied forth And, Staff in hand, on foot pursu'd our way Towards the distant Alps. An open slight Of College cares and study was the scheme, Nor entertain'd without concern for those To whom my worldly interests were dear: But Nature then was sovereign in my heart, And mighty forms seizing a youthful Fancy Had given a charter to irregular hopes. In any age, without an impulse sent From work of Nations, and their goings-on, I should have been possessed by like desire: But 'twas a time when Europe was rejoiced, France standing on the top of golden hours, And human nature seeming born again. Bound, as I said, to the Alps, it was our lot To land at Calais on the very eve Of that great federal Day; and there we saw, In a mean City, and among a few, How bright a face is worn when joy of one Is joy of tens of millions. Southward thence We took our way direct through Hamlets, Towns, Gaudy with reliques of that Festival, Flowers left to wither on triumphal Arcs, And window-Garlands. On the public roads, And, once, three days successively, through paths By which our toilsome journey was abridg'd, Among sequester'd villages we walked, And found benevolence and blessedness Spread like a fragrance everywhere, like Spring That leaves no corner of the land untouch'd. Where Elms, for many and many a league, in files, With their thin umbrage, on the stately roads Of that great Kingdom, rustled o'er our heads, For ever near us as we paced along, 'Twas sweet at such a time, with such delights On every side, in prime of youthful strength, To feed a Poet's tender melancholy And fond conceit of sadness, to the noise And gentle undulations which they made. Unhous'd, beneath the Evening Star we saw Dances of liberty, and, in late hours Of darkness, dances in the open air. Among the vine-clad Hills of Burgundy, Upon the bosom of the gentle Saone We glided forward with the flowing stream: Swift Rhone, thou wert the wings on which we cut Between thy lofty rocks! Enchanting show Those woods, and farms, and orchards did present, And single Cottages, and lurking Towns, Reach after reach, procession without end Of deep and stately Vales. A lonely Pair Of Englishmen we were, and sail'd along Cluster'd together with a merry crowd Of those emancipated, with a host Of Travellers, chiefly Delegates, returning From the great Spousals newly solemniz'd At their chief City in the sight of Heaven. Like bees they swarm'd, gaudy and gay as bees; Some vapour'd in the unruliness of joy And flourish'd with their swords, as if to fight The saucy air. In this blithe Company We landed, took with them our evening Meal, Guests welcome almost as the Angels were To Abraham of old. The Supper done, With flowing cups elate, and happy thoughts, We rose at signal giv'n, and form'd a ring And, hand in hand, danced round and round the Board; All hearts were open, every tongue was loud With amity and glee; we bore a name Honour'd in France, the name of Englishmen, And hospitably did they give us hail As their forerunners in a glorious course, And round, and round the board they danced again. With this same throng our voyage we pursu'd At early dawn; the Monastery Bells Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears The rapid River flowing without noise, And every Spire we saw among the rocks Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals Touching the heart amid the boisterous Crew With which we were environ'd. Having parted From this glad Rout, the Convent of Chartreuse Received us two days afterwards, and there We rested in an awful Solitude; Thence onward to the Country of the Swiss. 'Tis not my present purpose to retrace That variegated journey step by step: A march it was of military speed, And earth did change her images and forms Before us, fast as clouds are chang'd in Heaven. Day after day, up early and down late, From vale to vale, from hill to hill we went From Province on to Province did we pass, Keen Hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks Eager as birds of prey, or as a Ship Upon the stretch when winds are blowing fair. Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life, Enticing Vallies, greeted them, and left Too soon, while yet the very flash and gleam Of salutation were not pass'd away. Oh! sorrow for the Youth who could have seen Unchasten'd, unsubdu'd, unaw'd, unrais'd To patriarchal dignity of mind, And pure simplicity of wish and will, Those sanctified abodes of peaceful Man. My heart leap'd up when first I did look down On that which was first seen of those deep haunts, A green recess, an aboriginal vale Quiet, and lorded over and possess'd By naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tents Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns, And by the river side. That day we first Beheld the summit of Mont Blanc, and griev'd To have a soulless image on the eye Which had usurp'd upon a living thought That never more could be: the wondrous Vale Of Chamouny did, on the following dawn, With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice, A motionless array of mighty waves, Five rivers broad and vast, make rich amends, And reconcil'd us to realities. There small birds warble from the leafy trees, The Eagle soareth in the element; There doth the Reaper bind the yellow sheaf, The Maiden spread the haycock in the sun, While Winter like a tamed Lion walks Descending from the mountain to make sport Among the cottages by beds of flowers. Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld, Or heard, was fitted to our unripe state Of intellect and heart. By simple strains Of feeling, the pure breath of real life, We were not left untouch'd. With such a book Before our eyes, we could not chuse but read A frequent lesson of sound tenderness, The universal reason of mankind, The truth of Young and Old. Nor, side by side Pacing, two brother Pilgrims, or alone Each with his humour, could we fail to abound (Craft this which hath been hinted at before) In dreams and fictions pensively compos'd, Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake, And gilded sympathies; the willow wreath, Even among those solitudes sublime, And sober posies of funereal flowers, Cull'd from the gardens of the Lady Sorrow, Did sweeten many a meditative hour. Yet still in me, mingling with these delights Was something of stern mood, an under-thirst Of vigour, never utterly asleep. Far different dejection once was mine, A deep and genuine sadness then I felt; The circumstances here I will relate Even as they were. Upturning with a Band Of Travellers, from the Valais we had clomb Along the road that leads to Italy; A length of hours, making of these our Guides Did we advance, and having reach'd an Inn Among the mountains, we together ate Our noon's repast, from which the Travellers rose, Leaving us at the Board. Ere long we follow'd, Descending by the beaten road that led Right to a rivulet's edge, and there broke off. The only track now visible was one Upon the further side, right opposite, And up a lofty Mountain. This we took After a little scruple, and short pause, And climb'd with eagerness, though not, at length Without surprise, and some anxiety On finding that we did not overtake Our Comrades gone before. By fortunate chance, While every moment now increas'd our doubts, A Peasant met us, and from him we learn'd That to the place which had perplex'd us first We must descend, and there should find the road Which in the stony channel of the Stream Lay a few steps, and then along its banks; And further, that thenceforward all our course Was downwards, with the current of that Stream. Hard of belief, we question'd him again, And all the answers which the Man return'd To our inquiries, in their sense and substance, Translated by the feelings which we had Ended in this; that we had crossed the Alps. Imagination! lifting up itself Before the eye and progress of my Song Like an unfather'd vapour; here that Power, In all the might of its endowments, came Athwart me; I was lost as in a cloud, Halted, without a struggle to break through. And now recovering, to my Soul I say I recognise thy glory; in such strength Of usurpation, in such visitings Of awful promise, when the light of sense Goes out in flashes that have shewn to us The invisible world, doth Greatness make abode, There harbours whether we be young or old. Our destiny, our nature, and our home Is with infinitude, and only there; With hope it is, hope that can never die, Effort, and expectation, and desire, And something evermore about to be. The mind beneath such banners militant Thinks not of spoils or trophies, nor of aught That may attest its prowess, blest in thoughts That are their own perfection and reward, Strong in itself, and in the access of joy Which hides it like the overflowing Nile. The dull and heavy slackening that ensued Upon those tidings by the Peasant given Was soon dislodg'd; downwards we hurried fast, And enter'd with the road which we had miss'd Into a narrow chasm; the brook and road Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy Pass, And with them did we journey several hours At a slow step. The immeasurable height Of woods decaying, never to be decay'd, The stationary blasts of water-falls, And every where along the hollow rent Winds thwarting winds, bewilder'd and forlorn, The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky, The rocks that mutter'd close upon our ears, Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side As if a voice were in them, the sick sight And giddy prospect of the raving stream, The unfetter'd clouds, and region of the Heavens, Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light Were all like workings of one mind, the features Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree, Characters of the great Apocalypse, The types and symbols of Eternity, Of first and last, and midst, and without end. That night our lodging was an Alpine House, An Inn, or Hospital, as they are nam'd, Standing in that same valley by itself, And close upon the confluence of two Streams; A dreary Mansion, large beyond all need, With high and spacious rooms, deafen'd and stunn'd By noise of waters, making innocent Sleep Lie melancholy among weary bones. Upris'n betimes, our journey we renew'd, Led by the Stream, ere noon-day magnified Into a lordly River, broad and deep, Dimpling along in silent majesty, With mountains for its neighbours, and in view Of distant mountains and their snowy tops, And thus proceeding to Locarno's Lake, Fit resting-place for such a Visitant. —Locarno, spreading out in width like Heaven, And Como, thou, a treasure by the earth Kept to itself, a darling bosom'd up In Abyssinian privacy, I spake Of thee, thy chestnut woods, and garden plots Of Indian corn tended by dark-eyed Maids, Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roof'd with vines Winding from house to house, from town to town, Sole link that binds them to each other, walks League after league, and cloistral avenues Where silence is, if music be not there While yet a Youth, undisciplin'd in Verse, Through fond ambition of my heart, I told Your praises; nor can I approach you now Ungreeted by a more melodious Song, Where tones of learned Art and Nature mix'd May frame enduring language. Like a breeze Or sunbeam over your domain I pass'd In motion without pause; but Ye have left Your beauty with me, an impassion'd sight Of colours and of forms, whose power is sweet And gracious, almost might I dare to say, As virtue is, or goodness, sweet as love Or the remembrance of a noble deed, Or gentlest visitations of pure thought When God, the Giver of all joy, is thank'd Religiously, in silent blessedness, Sweet as this last herself; for such it is. Through those delightful pathways we advanc'd, Two days, and still in presence of the Lake, Which, winding up among the Alps, now chang'd Slowly its lovely countenance, and put on A sterner character. The second night, In eagerness, and by report misled Of those Italian clocks that speak the time In fashion different from ours, we rose By moonshine, doubting not that day was near, And that, meanwhile, coasting the Water's edge As hitherto, and with as plain a track To be our guide, we might behold the scene In its most deep repose.—We left the Town Of Gravedona with this hope; but soon Were lost, bewilder'd among woods immense, Where, having wander'd for a while, we stopp'd And on a rock sate down, to wait for day. An open place it was, and overlook'd From high, the sullen water underneath, On which a dull red image of the moon Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form Like an uneasy snake: long time we sate, For scarcely more than one hour of the night, Such was our error, had been gone, when we Renew'd our journey. On the rock we lay And wish'd to sleep but could not, for the stings Of insects, which with noise like that of noon Fill'd all the woods; the cry of unknown birds, The mountains, more by darkness visible And their own size, than any outward light, The breathless wilderness of clouds, the clock That told with unintelligible voice The widely-parted hours, the noise of streams And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand Which did not leave us free from personal fear, And lastly the withdrawing Moon, that set Before us, while she still was high in heaven, These were our food, and such a summer's night Did to that pair of golden days succeed, With now and then a doze and snatch of sleep, On Como's Banks, the same delicious Lake. But here I must break off, and quit at once, Though loth, the record of these wanderings, A theme which may seduce me else beyond All reasonable bounds. Let this alone Be mention'd as a parting word, that not In hollow exultation, dealing forth Hyperboles of praise comparative, Not rich one moment to be poor for ever, Not prostrate, overborn, as if the mind Itself were nothing, a mean pensioner On outward forms, did we in presence stand Of that magnificent region. On the front Of this whole Song is written that my heart Must in such temple needs have offer'd up A different worship. Finally whate'er I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream That flow'd into a kindred stream, a gale That help'd me forwards, did administer To grandeur and to tenderness, to the one Directly, but to tender thoughts by means Less often instantaneous in effect; Conducted me to these along a path Which in the main was more circuitous. Oh! most beloved Friend, a glorious time A happy time that was; triumphant looks Were then the common language of all eyes: As if awak'd from sleep, the Nations hail'd Their great expectancy: the fife of War Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed, A Blackbird's whistle in a vernal grove. We left the Swiss exulting in the fate Of their near Neighbours, and when shortening fast Our pilgrimage, nor distant far from home, We cross'd the Brabant Armies on the fret For battle in the cause of Liberty. A Stripling, scarcely of the household then Of social life, I look'd upon these things As from a distance, heard, and saw, and felt, Was touch'd, but with no intimate concern; I seem'd to move among them as a bird Moves through the air, or as a fish pursues Its business, in its proper element; I needed not that joy, I did not need Such help; the ever-living Universe, And independent spirit of pure youth Were with me at that season, and delight Was in all places spread around my steps As constant as the grass upon the fields. BOOK SEVENTH RESIDENCE IN LONDON Five years are vanish'd since I first pour'd out Saluted by that animating breeze Which met me issuing from the City's Walls, A glad preamble to this Verse: I sang Aloud, in Dythyrambic fervour, deep But short-liv'd uproar, like a torrent sent Out of the bowels of a bursting cloud Down Scafell, or Blencathra's rugged sides, A waterspout from Heaven. But 'twas not long Ere the interrupted stream broke forth once more, And flow'd awhile in strength, then stopp'd for years; Not heard again until a little space Before last primrose-time. Beloved Friend, The assurances then given unto myself, Which did beguile me of some heavy thoughts At thy departure to a foreign Land, Have fail'd; for slowly doth this work advance. Through the whole summer have I been at rest, Partly from voluntary holiday And part through outward indolence. But I heard, After the hour of sunset yester even, Sitting within doors betwixt light and dark, A voice that stirr'd me. 'Twas a little Band, A Quire of Redbreasts gather'd somewhere near My threshold, Minstrels from the distant woods And dells, sent in by Winter to bespeak For the Old Man a welcome, to announce, With preparation artful and benign, Yea the most gentle music of the year, That their rough Lord had left the surly North And hath begun his journey. A delight, At this unthought of greeting, unawares Smote me, a sweetness of the coming time, And listening, I half whispered, ‘We will be Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be Brethren, and in the hearing of bleak winds Will chaunt together.’ And, thereafter, walking By later twilight on the hills, I saw A Glow-worm from beneath a dusky shade Or canopy of the yet unwithered fern, Clear-shining, like a Hermit's taper seen Through a thick forest; silence touch'd me here No less than sound had done before; the Child Of Summer, lingering, shining by itself, The voiceless Worm on the unfrequented hills, Seem'd sent on the same errand with the Quire Of Winter that had warbled at my door, And the whole year seem'd tenderness and love. The last Night's genial feeling overflow'd Upon this morning, and my favourite grove, Now tossing its dark boughs in sun and wind Spreads through me a commotion like its own, Something that fits me for the Poet's task, Which we will now resume with chearful hope, Nor check'd by aught of tamer argument That lies before us, needful to be told. Return'd from that excursion, soon I bade Farewell for ever to the private Bowers Of gownèd Students, quitted these, no more To enter them, and pitch'd my vagrant tent, A casual Reveller and at large, among The unfenc'd regions of society. Yet undetermin'd to what plan of life I should adhere, and seeming thence to have A little space of intermediate time Loose and at full command, to London first I turn'd, if not in calmness, nevertheless In no disturbance of excessive hope, At ease from all ambition personal, Frugal as there was need, and though self-will'd, Yet temperate and reserv'd, and wholly free From dangerous passions. 'Twas at least two years Before this season when I first beheld That mighty place, a transient visitant: And now it pleas'd me my abode to fix Single in the wide waste, to have a house It was enough (what matter for a home?) That own'd me; living chearfully abroad, With fancy on the stir from day to day, And all my young affections out of doors. There was a time when whatsoe'er is feign'd Of airy Palaces, and Gardens built By Genii of Romance, or hath in grave Authentic History been set forth of Rome, Alcairo, Babylon, or Persepolis, Or given upon report by Pilgrim-Friars Of golden Cities ten months' journey deep Among Tartarian wilds, fell short, far short, Of that which I in simpleness believed And thought of London; held me by a chain Less strong of wonder, and obscure delight. I know not that herein I shot beyond The common mark of childhood; but I well Remember that among our flock of Boys Was one, a Cripple from his birth, whom chance Summon'd from School to London, fortunate And envied Traveller! and when he return'd, After short absence, and I first set eyes Upon his person, verily, though strange The thing may seem, I was not wholly free From disappointment to behold the same Appearance, the same body, not to find Some change, some beams of glory brought away From that new region. Much I question'd him, And every word he utter'd, on my ears Fell flatter than a cagèd Parrot's note, That answers unexpectedly awry, And mocks the Prompter's listening. Marvellous things My fancy had shap'd forth, of sights and shows, Processions, Equipages, Lords and Dukes, The King, and the King's Palace, and not last Or least, heaven bless him! the renown'd Lord Mayor: Dreams hardly less intense than those which wrought A change of purpose in young Whittington, When he in friendlessness, a drooping Boy, Sate on a Stone, and heard the Bells speak out Articulate music. Above all, one thought Baffled my understanding, how men lived Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still Strangers, and knowing not each other's names. Oh wond'rous power of words, how sweet they are According to the meaning which they bring! Vauxhall and Ranelagh, I then had heard Of your green groves, and wilderness of lamps, Your gorgeous Ladies, fairy cataracts, And pageant fireworks; nor must we forget Those other wonders different in kind, Though scarcely less illustrious in degree, The River proudly bridged, the giddy top And Whispering Gallery of St. Paul's, the Tombs Of Westminster, the Giants of Guildhall, Bedlam, and the two maniacs at its Gates, Streets without end, and Churches numberless, Statues, with flowery gardens in vast Squares, The Monument, and Armoury of the Tower. These fond imaginations of themselves Had long before given way in season due, Leaving a throng of others in their stead; And now I looked upon the real scene, Familiarly perus'd it day by day With keen and lively pleasure even there Where disappointment was the strongest, pleas'd Through courteous self-submission, as a tax Paid to the object by prescriptive right, A thing that ought to be. Shall I give way, Copying the impression of the memory, Though things unnumber'd idly do half seem The work of fancy, shall I, as the mood Inclines me, here describe, for pastime's sake Some portion of that motley imagery, A vivid pleasure of my Youth, and now Among the lonely places that I love A frequent day-dream for my riper mind? —And first the look and aspect of the place The broad high-way appearance, as it strikes On Strangers of all ages, the quick dance Of colours, lights and forms, the Babel din The endless stream of men, and moving things, From hour to hour the illimitable walk Still among streets with clouds and sky above, The wealth, the bustle and the eagerness, The glittering Chariots with their pamper'd Steeds, Stalls, Barrows, Porters; midway in the Street The Scavenger, who begs with hat in hand, The labouring Hackney Coaches, the rash speed Of Coaches travelling far, whirl'd on with horn Loud blowing, and the sturdy Drayman's Team, Ascending from some Alley of the Thames And striking right across the crowded Strand Till the fore Horse veer round with punctual skill: Here there and everywhere a weary throng The Comers and the Goers face to face, Face after face; the string of dazzling Wares, Shop after shop, with Symbols, blazon'd Names, And all the Tradesman's honours overhead; Here, fronts of houses, like a title-page With letters huge inscribed from top to toe; Station'd above the door, like guardian Saints, There, allegoric shapes, female or male; Or physiognomies of real men, Land-Warriors, Kings, or Admirals of the Sea, Boyle, Shakspear, Newton, or the attractive head Of some Scotch doctor, famous in his day. Meanwhile the roar continues, till at length, Escaped as from an enemy, we turn Abruptly into some sequester'd nook Still as a shelter'd place when winds blow loud: At leisure thence, through tracts of thin resort, And sights and sounds that come at intervals, We take our way: a raree-show is here With children gather'd round, another Street Presents a company of dancing Dogs, Or Dromedary, with an antic pair Of Monkies on his back, a minstrel Band Of Savoyards, or, single and alone, An English Ballad-singer. Private Courts, Gloomy as Coffins, and unsightly Lanes Thrill'd by some female Vender's scream, belike The very shrillest of all London Cries, May then entangle us awhile, Conducted through those labyrinths unawares To privileg'd Regions and inviolate, Where from their airy lodges studious Lawyers Look out on waters, walks, and gardens green. Thence back into the throng, until we reach, Following the tide that slackens by degrees, Some half-frequented scene where wider Streets Bring straggling breezes of suburban air; Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls, Advertisements of giant-size, from high Press forward in all colours on the sight; These, bold in conscious merit; lower down That, fronted with a most imposing word, Is, peradventure, one in masquerade. As on the broadening Causeway we advance, Behold a Face turn'd up toward us, strong In lineaments, and red with over-toil; 'Tis one perhaps, already met elsewhere, A travelling Cripple, by the trunk cut short, And stumping with his arms: in Sailor's garb Another lies at length beside a range Of written characters, with chalk inscrib'd Upon the smooth flat stones: the Nurse is here, The Bachelor that loves to sun himself, The military Idler, and the Dame, That field-ward takes her walk in decency. Now homeward through the thickening hubbub, where See, among less distinguishable shapes, The Italian, with his frame of Images Upon his head; with Basket at his waist The Jew; the stately and slow-moving Turk With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm. Briefly, we find, if tired of random sights And haply to that search our thoughts should turn, Among the crowd, conspicuous less or more, As we proceed, all specimens of Man Through all the colours which the sun bestows, And every character of form and face, The Swede, the Russian; from the genial South, The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from remote America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors, Malays, Lascars, the Tartar and Chinese, And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns. At leisure let us view, from day to day, As they present themselves, the Spectacles Within doors, troops of wild Beasts, birds and beasts Of every nature, from all climes conven'd; And, next to these, those mimic sights that ape The absolute presence of reality, Expressing, as in mirror, sea and land, And what earth is, and what she has to shew; I do not here allude to subtlest craft, By means refin'd attaining purest ends, But imitations fondly made in plain Confession of Man's weakness, and his loves. Whether the Painter fashioning a work To Nature's circumambient scenery, And with his greedy pencil taking in A whole horizon with power on all sides, Like that of Angels or commission'd Spirits, Plant us upon some lofty Pinnacle, Or in a Ship on Waters, with a world Of life, and life-like mockery, to East, To West, beneath, behind us, and before; Or more mechanic Artist represent By scale exact, in Model, wood or clay, From shading colours also borrowing help, Some miniature of famous spots and things Domestic, or the boast of foreign Realms; The Firth of Forth, and Edinburgh throned On crags, fit empress of that mountain Land; St. Peter's Church; or, more aspiring aim, In microscopic vision, Rome itself; Or, else perhaps, some rural haunt, the Falls Of Tivoli, and high upon that steep The Temple of the Sibyl, every tree Through all the landscape, tuft, stone, scratch minute, And every Cottage, lurking in the rocks, All that the Traveller sees when he is there. Add to these exhibitions mute and still Others of wider scope, where living men, Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes, Together join'd their multifarious aid To heighten the allurement. Need I fear To mention by its name, as in degree Lowest of these, and humblest in attempt, Though richly graced with honours of its own, Half-rural Sadler's Wells? Though at that time Intolerant, as is the way of Youth Unless itself be pleased, I more than once Here took my seat, and, maugre frequent fits Of irksomeness, with ample recompense Saw Singers, Rope-dancers, Giants and Dwarfs, Clowns, Conjurors, Posture-masters, Harlequins, Amid the uproar of the rabblement, Perform their feats. Nor was it mean delight To watch crude nature work in untaught minds, To note the laws and progress of belief; Though obstinate on this way, yet on that How willingly we travel, and how far! To have, for instance, brought upon the scene The Champion Jack the Giant-killer, Lo! He dons his Coat of Darkness; on the Stage Walks, and atchieves his wonders, from the eye Of living mortal safe as is the moon ‘Hid in her vacant interlunar cave’. Delusion bold! and faith must needs be coy; How is it wrought? His garb is black, the word Invisible flames forth upon his chest. Nor was it unamusing here to view Those samples as of ancient Comedy And Thespian times, dramas of living Men, And recent things, yet warm with life; a Sea-fight, Shipwreck, or some domestic incident The fame of which is scatter'd through the Land; Such as the daring brotherhood of late Set forth, too holy theme for such a place, And doubtless treated with irreverence Albeit with their very best of skill, I mean, O distant Friend! a Story drawn From our own ground, the Maid of Buttermere, And how the Spoiler came, ‘a bold bad Man’ To God unfaithful, Children, Wife, and Home, And wooed the artless Daughter of the hills, And wedded her, in cruel mockery Of love and marriage bonds. O Friend! I speak With tender recollection of that time When first we saw the Maiden, then a name By us unheard of; in her cottage Inn Were welcomed, and attended on by her, Both stricken with one feeling of delight, An admiration of her modest mien, And carriage, mark'd by unexampled grace. Not unfamiliarly we since that time Have seen her; her discretion have observ'd, Her just opinions, female modesty, Her patience, and retiredness of mind Unsoil'd by commendation, and the excess Of public notice. This memorial Verse Comes from the Poet's heart, and is her due. For we were nursed, as almost might be said, On the same mountains; Children at one time Must haply often on the self-same day Have from our several dwellings gone abroad To gather daffodils on Coker's Stream. These last words utter'd, to my argument I was returning, when, with sundry Forms Mingled, that in the way which I must tread Before me stand, thy image rose again, Mary of Buttermere! She lives in peace Upon the ground where she was born and rear'd; Without contamination does she live In quietness, without anxiety: Beside the mountain-Chapel sleeps in earth Her new-born Infant, fearless as a lamb That thither comes, from some unsheltered place, To rest beneath the little rock-like Pile When storms are blowing. Happy are they both Mother and Child! These feelings, in themselves Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think On those ingenuous moments of our youth, Ere yet by use we have learn'd to slight the crimes And sorrows of the world. Those days are now My theme; and, mid the numerous scenes which they Have left behind them, foremost I am cross'd Here by remembrance of two figures, One A rosy Babe, who, for a twelvemonth's space Perhaps, had been of age to deal about Articulate prattle, Child as beautiful As ever sate upon a Mother's knee; The other was the Parent of that Babe; But on the Mother's cheek the tints were false, A painted bloom. 'Twas at a Theatre That I beheld this Pair; the Boy had been The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on In whatsoever place; but seem'd in this A sort of Alien scatter'd from the clouds. Of lusty vigour, more than infantine, He was in limbs, in face a cottage rose Just three parts blown; a Cottage Child, but ne'er Saw I, by Cottage or elsewhere, a Babe By Nature's gifts so honor'd. Upon a Board Whence an attendant of the Theatre Serv'd out refreshments, had this Child been plac'd, And there he sate, environ'd with a Ring Of chance Spectators, chiefly dissolute men And shameless women; treated and caress'd, Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses play'd, While oaths, indecent speech, and ribaldry Were rife about him as are songs of birds In spring-time after showers. The Mother, too, Was present! but of her I know no more Than hath been said, and scarcely at this time Do I remember her. But I behold The lovely Boy as I beheld him then, Among the wretched and the falsely gay, Like one of those who walk'd with hair unsinged Amid the fiery furnace. He hath since Appear'd to me oft times as if embalm'd By Nature; through some special privilege, Stopp'd at the growth he had; destined to live, To be, to have been, come and go, a Child And nothing more, no partner in the years That bear us forward to distress and guilt, Pain and abasement, beauty in such excess Adorn'd him in that miserable place. So have I thought of him a thousand times, And seldom otherwise. But he perhaps Mary! may now have liv'd till he could look With envy on thy nameless Babe that sleeps Beside the mountain Chapel, undisturb'd! It was but little more than three short years Before the season which I speak of now When first, a Traveller from our pastoral hills, Southward two hundred miles I had advanced, And for the first time in my life did hear The voice of Woman utter blasphemy; Saw Woman as she is to open shame Abandon'd and the pride of public vice. Full surely from the bottom of my heart I shuddered; but the pain was almost lost, Absorb'd and buried in the immensity Of the effect: a barrier seemed at once Thrown in, that from humanity divorced The Human Form, splitting the race of Man In twain, yet leaving the same outward shape. Distress of mind ensued upon this sight And ardent meditation; afterwards A milder sadness on such spectacles Attended; thought, commiseration, grief For the individual, and the overthrow Of her soul's beauty; farther at that time Than this I was but seldom led; in truth The sorrow of the passion stopp'd me here. I quit this painful theme; enough is said To shew what thoughts must often have been mine At theatres, which then were my delight, A yearning made more strong by obstacles Which slender funds imposed. Life then was new, The senses easily pleased; the lustres, lights, The carving and the gilding, paint and glare, And all the mean upholstery of the place, Wanted not animation in my sight: Far less the living Figures on the Stage, Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous Dame Advanced in radiance through a deep recess Of thick-entangled forest, like the Moon Opening the clouds; or sovereign King, announced With flourishing Trumpets, came in full-blown State Of the world's greatness, winding round with Train Of Courtiers, Banners, and a length of Guards; Or Captive led in abject weeds, and jingling His slender manacles; or romping Girl Bounced, leapt, and paw'd the air; or mumbling Sire, A scare-crow pattern of old Age, patch'd up Of all the tatters of infirmity, All loosely put together, hobbled in, Stumping upon a Cane, with which he smites, From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout Of one so overloaded with his years. But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace, And all the antics and buffoonery, The least of them not lost, were all received With charitable pleasure. Through the night, Between the show, and many-headed mass Of the Spectators, and each little nook That had its fray or brawl, how eagerly, And with what flashes, as it were, the mind Turn'd this way, that way! sportive and alert And watchful, as a kitten when at play, While winds are blowing round her, among grass And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet! Romantic almost, looked at through a space, How small of intervening years! For then, Though surely no mean progress had been made In meditations holy and sublime, Yet something of a girlish child-like gloss Of novelty surviv'd for scenes like these; Pleasure that had been handed down from times When, at a Country-Playhouse, having caught, In summer, through the fractur'd wall, a glimpse Of daylight, at the thought of where I was I gladden'd more than if I had beheld Before me some bright cavern of Romance, Or than we do, when on our beds we lie At night, in warmth, when rains are beating hard. The matter that detains me now will seem, To many neither dignified enough Nor arduous; and is, doubtless, in itself Humble and low; yet not to be despis'd By those who have observ'd the curious props By which the perishable hours of life Rest on each other, and the world of thought Exists and is sustain'd. More lofty Themes, Such as, at least, do wear a prouder face, Might here be spoken of; but when I think Of these, I feel the imaginative Power Languish within me; even then it slept When, wrought upon by tragic sufferings, The heart was full; amid my sobs and tears It slept, even in the season of my youth: For though I was most passionately moved And yielded to the changes of the scene With most obsequious feeling, yet all this Pass'd not beyond the suburbs of the mind: If aught there were of real grandeur here 'Twas only then when gross realities, The incarnation of the Spirits that mov'd Amid the Poet's beauteous world, call'd forth, With that distinctness which a contrast gives Or opposition, made me recognize As by a glimpse, the things which I had shap'd And yet not shaped, had seen, and scarcely seen, Had felt, and thought of in my solitude. Pass we from entertainments that are such Professedly to others titled higher, Yet in the estimate of youth at least, More near akin to those than names imply, I mean the brawls of Lawyers in their Courts Before the ermined Judge, or that great Stage Where Senators, tongue-favour'd Men, perform, Admir'd and envied. Oh! the beating heart! When one among the prime of these rose up, One, of whose name from Childhood we had heard Familiarly, a household term, like those, The Bedfords, Glocesters, Salisburys of old, Which the fifth Harry talks of. Silence! hush! This is no trifler, no short-flighted Wit, No stammerer of a minute, painfully Deliver'd. No! the Orator hath yoked The Hours, like young Aurora, to his Car; O Presence of delight, can patience e'er Grow weary of attending on a track That kindles with such glory? Marvellous! The enchantment spreads and rises; all are rapt Astonish'd; like a Hero in Romance He winds away his never-ending horn, Words follow words, sense seems to follow sense; What memory and what logic! till the Strain Transcendent, superhuman as it is, Grows tedious even in a young Man's ear. These are grave follies: other public Shows The capital City teems with, of a kind More light, and where but in the holy Church? There have I seen a comely Bachelor, Fresh from a toilette of two hours, ascend The Pulpit, with seraphic glance look up, And, in a tone elaborately low Beginning, lead his voice through many a maze, A minuet course, and winding up his mouth, From time to time into an orifice Most delicate, a lurking eyelet, small And only not invisible, again Open it out, diffusing thence a smile Of rapt irradiation exquisite. Meanwhile the Evangelists, Isaiah, Job, Moses, and he who penn'd the other day The Death of Abel, Shakspear, Doctor Young, And Ossian, (doubt not, 'tis the naked truth) Summon'd from streamy Morven, each and all Must in their turn lend ornament and flowers To entwine the Crook of eloquence with which This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the Plains, Leads up and down his captivated Flock. I glance but at a few conspicuous marks, Leaving ten thousand others, that do each, In Hall or Court, Conventicle, or Shop, In public Room or private, Park or Street, With fondness rear'd on his own Pedestal, Look out for admiration. Folly, vice, Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress, And all the strife of singularity, Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense, Of these, and of the living shapes they wear, There is no end. Such Candidates for regard, Although well pleased to be where they were found, I did not hunt after, or greatly prize, Nor made unto myself a secret boast Of reading them with quick and curious eye; But as a common produce, things that are To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them Such willing note as, on some errand bound Of pleasure or of Love some Traveller might, Among a thousand other images, Of sea-shells that bestud the sandy beach, Or daisies swarming through the fields in June. But foolishness, and madness in parade, Though most at home in this their dear domain, Are scatter'd everywhere, no rarities, Even to the rudest novice of the Schools. O Friend! one feeling was there which belong'd To this great City, by exclusive right; How often in the overflowing Streets, Have I gone forward with the Crowd, and said Unto myself, the face of every one That passes by me is a mystery. Thus have I look'd, nor ceas'd to look, oppress'd By thoughts of what, and whither, when and how, Until the shapes before my eyes became A second-sight procession, such as glides Over still mountains, or appears in dreams; And all the ballast of familiar life, The present, and the past; hope, fear; all stays, All laws of acting, thinking, speaking man Went from me, neither knowing me, nor known. And once, far-travell'd in such mood, beyond The reach of common indications, lost Amid the moving pageant, 'twas my chance Abruptly to be smitten with the view Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face, Stood propp'd against a Wall, upon his Chest Wearing a written paper, to explain The story of the Man, and who he was. My mind did at this spectacle turn round As with the might of waters, and it seem'd To me that in this Label was a type, Or emblem, of the utmost that we know, Both of ourselves and of the universe; And, on the shape of the unmoving man, His fixèd face and sightless eyes, I look'd As if admonish'd from another world. Though rear'd upon the base of outward things, These, chiefly, are such structures as the mind Builds for itself. Scenes different there are, Full-form'd, which take, with small internal help, Possession of the faculties; the peace Of night, for instance, the solemnity Of nature's intermediate hours of rest, When the great tide of human life stands still, The business of the day to come unborn, Of that gone by, lock'd up as in the grave; The calmness, beauty, of the spectacle, Sky, stillness, moonshine, empty streets, and sounds Unfrequent as in desarts; at late hours Of winter evenings when unwholesome rains Are falling hard, with people yet astir, The feeble salutation from the voice Of some unhappy Woman, now and then Heard as we pass; when no one looks about, Nothing is listen'd to. But these, I fear, Are falsely catalogu'd, things that are, are not, Even as we give them welcome, or assist, Are prompt, or are remiss. What say you then, To times, when half the City shall break out Full of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear, To executions, to a Street on fire, Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From these sights Take one, an annual Festival, the Fair Holden where Martyrs suffer'd in past time, And named of Saint Bartholomew; there see A work that's finish'd to our hands, that lays, If any spectacle on earth can do, The whole creative powers of man asleep! For once the Muse's help will we implore, And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings, Above the press and danger of the Crowd, Upon some Showman's platform: what a hell For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din Barbarian and infernal! 'tis a dream, Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound. Below, the open space, through every nook Of the wide area, twinkles, is alive With heads; the midway region and above Is throng'd with staring pictures, and huge scrolls, Dumb proclamations of the prodigies; And chattering monkeys dangling from their poles, And children whirling in their roundabouts; With those that stretch the neck, and strain the eyes, And crack the voice in rivalship, the crowd Inviting; with buffoons against buffoons Grimacing, writhing, screaming; him who grinds The hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves; Rattles the salt-box, thumps the kettle-drum, And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks, The silver-collar'd Negro with his timbrel, Equestrians, Tumblers, Women, Girls, and Boys, Blue-breech'd, pink-vested, and with towering plumes. —All moveables of wonder from all parts, Are here, Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs, The Horse of Knowledge, and the learned Pig, The Stone-eater, the Man that swallows fire, Giants, Ventriloquists, the Invisible Girl, The Bust that speaks, and moves its goggling eyes, The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craft Of modern Merlins, wild Beasts, Puppet-shows, All out-o'-the-way, far-fetch'd, perverted things, All freaks of Nature, all Promethean thoughts Of Man; his dulness, madness, and their feats, All jumbled up together to make up This Parliament of Monsters. Tents and Booths Meanwhile, as if the whole were one vast Mill, Are vomiting, receiving, on all sides, Men, Women, three-years' Children, Babes in arms. Oh, blank confusion! and a type not false Of what the mighty City is itself To all except a Straggler here and there, To the whole Swarm of its inhabitants; An undistinguishable world to men, The slaves unrespited of low pursuits, Living amid the same perpetual flow Of trivial objects, melted and reduced To one identity, by differences That have no law, no meaning, and no end; Oppression under which even highest minds Must labour, whence the strongest are not free; But though the picture weary out the eye, By nature an unmanageable sight, It is not wholly so to him who looks In steadiness, who hath among least things An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts As parts, but with a feeling of the whole. This, of all acquisitions first, awaits On sundry and most widely different modes Of education; nor with least delight On that through which I pass'd. Attention comes, And comprehensiveness and memory, From early converse with the works of God Among all regions; chiefly where appear Most obviously simplicity and power. By influence habitual to the mind The mountain's outline and its steady form Gives a pure grandeur, and its presence shapes The measure and the prospect of the soul To majesty; such virtue have the forms Perennial of the ancient hills; nor less The changeful language of their countenances Gives movement to the thoughts, and multitude, With order and relation. This, if still, As hitherto, with freedom I may speak, And the same perfect openness of mind, Not violating any just restraint, As I would hope, of real modesty, This did I feel in that vast receptacle. The Spirit of Nature was upon me here; The Soul of Beauty and enduring life Was present as a habit, and diffused, Through meagre lines and colours, and the press Of self-destroying, transitory things Composure and ennobling Harmony. BOOK EIGHTH RETROSPECT.—LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MANKIND What sounds are those, Helvellyn, which are heard Up to thy summit? Through the depth of air Ascending, as if distance had the power To make the sounds more audible: what Crowd Is yon, assembled in the gay green Field? Crowd seems it, solitary Hill! to thee, Though but a little Family of Men, Twice twenty, with their Children and their Wives, And here and there a Stranger interspers'd. It is a summer festival, a Fair, Such as, on this side now, and now on that, Repeated through his tributary Vales, Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest, Sees annually, if storms be not abroad, And mists have left him an unshrouded head. Delightful day it is for all who dwell In this secluded Glen, and eagerly They give it welcome. Long ere heat of noon Behold the cattle are driven down; the sheep That have for traffic been cull'd out are penn'd In cotes that stand together on the Plain Ranged side by side; the chaffering is begun. The Heifer lows uneasy at the voice Of a new Master, bleat the Flocks aloud; Booths are there none; a Stall or two is here, A lame Man, or a blind, the one to beg, The other to make music; hither, too, From far, with Basket, slung upon her arm, Of Hawker's Wares, books, pictures, combs, and pins, Some aged Woman finds her way again, Year after year a punctual visitant! The Showman with his Freight upon his Back, And once, perchance, in lapse of many years Prouder Itinerant, Mountebank, or He Whose Wonders in a cover'd Wain lie hid. But One is here, the loveliest of them all, Some sweet Lass of the Valley, looking out For gains, and who that sees her would not buy? Fruits of her Father's Orchard, apples, pears, (On that day only to such office stooping) She carries in her Basket, and walks round Among the crowd, half pleas'd with, half ashamed Of her new calling, blushing restlessly. The Children now are rich, the old Man now Is generous; so gaiety prevails Which all partake of, Young and Old. Immense Is the Recess, the circumambient World Magnificent, by which they are embraced. They move about upon the soft green field: How little They, they and their doings seem, Their herds and flocks about them, they themselves, And all that they can further or obstruct! Through utter weakness pitiably dear As tender Infants are: and yet how great! For all things serve them; them the Morning light Loves as it glistens on the silent rocks, And them the silent Rocks, which now from high Look down upon them; the reposing Clouds, The lurking Brooks from their invisible haunts, And Old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir, And the blue Sky that roofs their calm abode. With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel In that great City what I owed to thee, High thoughts of God and Man, and love of Man, Triumphant over all those loathsome sights Of wretchedness and vice; a watchful eye, Which with the outside of our human life Not satisfied, must read the inner mind; For I already had been taught to love My Fellow-beings, to such habits train'd Among the woods and mountains, where I found In thee a gracious Guide, to lead me forth Beyond the bosom of my Family, My Friends and youthful Playmates. 'Twas thy power That rais'd the first complacency in me, And noticeable kindliness of heart, Love human to the Creature in himself As he appear'd, a stranger in my path, Before my eyes a Brother of this world; Thou first didst with those motions of delight Inspire me.—I remember, far from home Once having stray'd, while yet a very Child, I saw a sight, and with what joy and love! It was a day of exhalations, spread Upon the mountains, mists and steam-like fogs Redounding everywhere, not vehement, But calm and mild, gentle and beautiful, With gleams of sunshine on the eyelet spots And loop-holes of the hills, wherever seen, Hidden by quiet process, and as soon Unfolded, to be huddled up again: Along a narrow Valley and profound I journey'd, when, aloft above my head, Emerging from the silvery vapours, lo! A Shepherd and his Dog! in open day: Girt round with mists they stood and look'd about From that enclosure small, inhabitants Of an aerial Island floating on, As seem'd, with that Abode in which they were, A little pendant area of grey rocks, By the soft wind breath'd forward. With delight As bland almost, one Evening I beheld, And at as early age (the spectacle Is common, but by me was then first seen) A Shepherd in the bottom of a Vale Towards the centre standing, who with voice, And hand waved to and fro as need required Gave signal to his Dog, thus teaching him To chace along the mazes of steep crags The Flock he could not see: and so the Brute Dear Creature! with a Man's intelligence Advancing, or retreating on his steps, Through every pervious strait, to right or left, Thridded away unbaffled; while the Flock Fled upwards from the terror of his Bark Through rocks and seams of turf with liquid gold Irradiate, that deep farewell light by which The setting sun proclaims the love he bears To mountain regions. Beauteous the domain Where to the sense of beauty first my heart Was open'd, tract more exquisitely fair Than is that Paradise of ten thousand Trees, Or Gehol's famous Gardens, in a Clime Chosen from widest empire, for delight Of the Tartarian Dynasty composed; (Beyond that mighty Wall, not fabulous, China's stupendous mound!) by patient skill Of myriads, and boon Nature's lavish help; Scene link'd to scene, an evergrowing change, Soft, grand, or gay! with Palaces and Domes Of Pleasure spangled over, shady Dells For Eastern Monasteries, sunny Mounds With Temples crested, Bridges, Gondolas, Rocks, Dens, and Groves of foliage taught to melt Into each other their obsequious hues Going and gone again, in subtile chace, Too fine to be pursued; or standing forth In no discordant opposition, strong And gorgeous as the colours side by side Bedded among rich plumes of Tropic Birds; And mountains over all embracing all; And all the landscape endlessly enrich'd With waters running, falling, or asleep. But lovelier far than this the Paradise Where I was rear'd; in Nature's primitive gifts Favor'd no less, and more to every sense Delicious, seeing that the sun and sky, The elements and seasons in their change Do find their dearest Fellow-labourer there, The heart of Man, a district on all sides The fragrance breathing of humanity, Man free, man working for himself, with choice Of time, and place, and object; by his wants, His comforts, native occupations, cares, Conducted on to individual ends Or social, and still followed by a train Unwoo'd, unthought-of even, simplicity, And beauty, and inevitable grace. Yea, doubtless, at an age when but a glimpse Of those resplendent Gardens, with their frame Imperial, and elaborate ornaments, Would to a child be transport over-great, When but a half-hour's roam through such a place Would leave behind a dance of images That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks; Even then the common haunts of the green earth, With the ordinary human interests Which they embosom, all without regard As both may seem, are fastening on the heart Insensibly, each with the other's help, So that we love, not knowing that we love, And feel, not knowing whence our feeling comes. Such league have these two principles of joy In our affections. I have singled out Some moments, the earliest that I could, in which Their several currents blended into one, Weak yet, and gathering imperceptibly, Flow'd in by gushes. My first human love, As hath been mention'd, did incline to those Whose occupations and concerns were most Illustrated by Nature and adorn'd, And Shepherds were the men who pleas'd me first. Not such as in Arcadian Fastnesses Sequester'd, handed down among themselves, So ancient Poets sing, the golden Age Nor such, a second Race, allied to these, As Shakespeare in the Wood of Arden plac'd Where Phoebe sigh'd for the false Ganymede, Or there where Florizel and Perdita Together danc'd, Queen of the Feast and King; Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is, That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen) Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far Their May-bush, and along the Streets, in flocks, Parading with a Song of taunting Rhymes, Aim'd at the Laggards slumbering within doors; Had also heard, from those who yet remember'd, Tales of the May-pole Dance, and flowers that deck'd The Posts and the Kirk-pillars, and of Youths, That each one with his Maid, at break of day, By annual custom issued forth in troops, To drink the waters of some favorite well, And hang it round with Garlands. This, alas! Was but a dream; the times had scatter'd all These lighter graces, and the rural custom And manners which it was my chance to see In childhood were severe and unadorn'd, The unluxuriant produce of a life Intent on little but substantial needs, Yet beautiful, and beauty that was felt. But images of danger and distress, And suffering among awful Powers, and Forms; Of this I heard and saw enough to make The imagination restless; nor was free Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales Wanting, the tragedies of former times, Or hazards and escapes, which in my walks I carried with me among crags and woods And mountains; and of these may here be told One, as recorded by my Household Dame. At the first falling of autumnal snow A Shepherd and his Son one day went forth (Thus did the Matron's Tale begin) to seek A Straggler of their Flock. They both had rang'd Upon this service the preceding day All over their own pastures and beyond, And now, at sun-rise sallying out again Renew'd their search begun where from Dove Crag, Ill home for bird so gentle, they look'd down On Deep-dale Head, and Brothers-water, named From those two Brothers that were drown'd therein. Thence, northward, having pass'd by Arthur's Seat, To Fairfield's highest summit; on the right Leaving St. Sunday's Pike, to Grisedale Tarn They shot, and over that cloud-loving Hill, Seat Sandal, a fond lover of the clouds; Thence up Helvellyn, a superior Mount With prospect underneath of Striding-Edge, And Grisedale's houseless Vale, along the brink Of Russet Cove, and those two other Coves, Huge skeletons of crags, which from the trunk Of old Helvellyn spread their arms abroad, And make a stormy harbour for the winds. Far went those Shepherds in their devious quest, From mountain ridges peeping as they pass'd Down into every Glen: at length the Boy Said, ‘Father, with your leave I will go back, And range the ground which we have search'd before.’ So speaking, southward down the hill the Lad Sprang like a gust of wind, crying aloud ‘I know where I shall find him.’ ‘For take note, Said here my grey-hair'd Dame, that tho' the storm Drive one of these poor Creatures miles and miles, If he can crawl he will return again To his own hills, the spots where, when a Lamb, He learn'd to pasture at his Mother's side.’ After so long a labour, suddenly Bethinking him of this, the Boy Pursued his way towards a brook whose course Was through that unfenced tract of mountain-ground Which to his Father's little Farm belong'd, The home and ancient Birth-right of their Flock. Down the deep channel of the Stream he went, Prying through every nook; meanwhile the rain Began to fall upon the mountain tops, Thick storm and heavy which for three hours' space Abated not; and all that time the Boy Was busy in his search until at length He spied the Sheep upon a plot of grass, An Island in the Brook. It was a place Remote and deep, piled round with rocks where foot Of man or beast was seldom used to tread; But now, when everywhere the summer grass Had fail'd, this one Adventurer, hunger-press'd, Had left his Fellows, and made his way alone To the green plot of pasture in the Brook. Before the Boy knew well what he had seen He leapt upon the Island with proud heart And with a Prophet's joy. Immediately The Sheep sprang forward to the further Shore And was borne headlong by the roaring flood. At this the Boy look'd round him, and his heart Fainted with fear; thrice did he turn his face To either brink; nor could he summon up The courage that was needful to leap back Cross the tempestuous torrent; so he stood, A Prisoner on the Island, not without More than one thought of death and his last hour. Meanwhile the Father had return'd alone To his own house; and now at the approach Of evening he went forth to meet his Son, Conjecturing vainly for what cause the Boy Had stay'd so long. The Shepherd took his way Up his own mountain grounds, where, as he walk'd Along the Steep that overhung the Brook, He seem'd to hear a voice, which was again Repeated, like the whistling of a kite. At this, not knowing why, as oftentimes Long afterwards he has been heard to say, Down to the Brook he went, and track'd its course Upwards among the o'erhanging rocks; nor thus Had he gone far, ere he espied the Boy Where on that little plot of ground he stood Right in the middle of the roaring Stream, Now stronger every moment and more fierce. The sight was such as no one could have seen Without distress and fear. The Shepherd heard The outcry of his Son, he stretch'd his Staff Towards him, bade him leap, which word scarce said The Boy was safe within his Father's arms. Smooth life had Flock and Shepherd in old time, Long Springs and tepid Winters on the Banks Of delicate Galesus; and no less Those scatter'd along Adria's myrtle Shores: Smooth life the herdsman and his snow-white Herd To Triumphs and to sacrificial Rites Devoted, on the inviolable Stream Of rich Clitumnus; and the Goat-herd liv'd As sweetly, underneath the pleasant brows Of cool Lucretilis, where the Pipe was heard Of Pan, the invisible God, thrilling the rocks With tutelary music, from all harm The Fold protecting. I myself, mature In manhood then, have seen a pastoral Tract Like one of these, where Fancy might run wild, Though under skies less generous and serene; Yet there, as for herself, had Nature fram'd A Pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse Of level Pasture, islanded with Groves And bank'd with woody Risings; but the Plain Endless; here opening widely out, and there Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn And intricate recesses, creek or bay Shelter'd within a shelter, where at large The Shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home: Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides All summer, and at sunrise yet may hear His flute or flagelet resounding far; There's not a Nook or Hold of that vast space, Nor Strait where passage is, but it shall have In turn its Visitant, telling there his hours In unlaborious pleasure, with no task More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl For Spring or Fountain, which the Traveller finds When through the region he pursues at will His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life I saw when, from the melancholy Walls Of Goslar, once Imperial! I renew'd My daily walk along that chearful Plain, Which, reaching to her Gates, spreads East and West And Northwards, from beneath the mountainous verge Of the Hercynian forest. Yet hail to You, Your rocks and precipices, Ye that seize The heart with firmer grasp! your snows and streams Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds, That howl'd so dismally when I have been Companionless, among your solitudes. There 'tis the Shepherd's task the winter long To wait upon the storms: of their approach Sagacious, from the height he drives his Flock Down into sheltering coves, and feeds them there Through the hard time, long as the storm is lock'd, (So do they phrase it) bearing from the stalls A toilsome burden up the craggy ways, To strew it on the snow. And when the Spring Looks out, and all the mountains dance with lambs, He through the enclosures won from the steep Waste, And through the lower Heights hath gone his rounds; And when the Flock with warmer weather climbs Higher and higher, him his office leads To range among them, through the hills dispers'd, And watch their goings, whatsoever track Each Wanderer chuses for itself; a work That lasts the summer through. He quits his home At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat Than he lies down upon some shining place And breakfasts with his Dog; when he hath stay'd, As for the most he doth, beyond his time, He springs up with a bound, and then away! Ascending fast with his long Pole in hand, Or winding in and out among the crags. What need to follow him through what he does Or sees in his day's march? He feels himself In those vast regions where his service is A Freeman; wedded to his life of hope And hazard, and hard labour interchang'd With that majestic indolence so dear To native Man. A rambling Schoolboy, thus Have I beheld him, without knowing why Have felt his presence in his own domain, As of a Lord and Master; or a Power Or Genius, under Nature, under God, Presiding; and severest solitude Seem'd more commanding oft when he was there. Seeking the raven's nest, and suddenly Surpriz'd with vapours, or on rainy days When I have angled up the lonely brooks Mine eyes have glanced upon him, few steps off, In size a giant, stalking through the fog, His Sheep like Greenland Bears; at other times When round some shady promontory turning, His Form hath flash'd upon me, glorified By the deep radiance of the setting sun: Or him have I descried in distant sky, A solitary object and sublime, Above all height! like an aerial Cross, As it is stationed on some spiry Rock Of the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was Man Ennobled outwardly before mine eyes, And thus my heart at first was introduc'd To an unconscious love and reverence Of human Nature; hence the human form To me was like an index of delight, Of grace and honour, power and worthiness. Meanwhile, this Creature, spiritual almost As those of Books; but more exalted far, Far more of an imaginative form, Was not a Corin of the groves, who lives For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour In coronal, with Phillis in the midst, But, for the purposes of kind, a Man With the most common; Husband, Father; learn'd, Could teach, admonish, suffer'd with the rest From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear; Of this I little saw, car'd less for it, But something must have felt. Call ye these appearances Which I beheld of Shepherds in my youth, This sanctity of Nature given to Man A shadow, a delusion, ye who are fed By the dead letter, miss the spirit of things, Whose truth is not a motion or a shape Instinct with vital functions, but a Block Or waxen Image which yourselves have made, And ye adore. But blessed be the God Of Nature and of Man that this was so, That Men did at the first present themselves Before my untaught eyes thus purified, Remov'd, and at a distance that was fit. And so we all of us in some degree Are led to knowledge, whencesoever led, And howsoever; were it otherwise, And we found evil fast as we find good In our first years, or think that it is found, How could the innocent heart bear up and live! But doubly fortunate my lot; not here Alone, that something of a better life Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege Of most to move in, but that first I look'd At Man through objects that were great or fair, First commun'd with him by their help. And thus Was founded a sure safeguard and defence Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares, Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in On all sides from the ordinary world In which we traffic. Starting from this point, I had my face towards the truth, began With an advantage; furnish'd with that kind Of prepossession without which the soul Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good, No genuine insight ever comes to her: Happy in this, that I with nature walk'd, Not having a too early intercourse With the deformities of crowded life, And those ensuing laughters and contempts Self-pleasing, which if we would wish to think With admiration and respect of man Will not permit us; but pursue the mind That to devotion willingly would be rais'd Into the Temple and the Temple's heart. Yet do not deem, my Friend, though thus I speak Of Man as having taken in my mind A place thus early which might almost seem Pre-eminent, that it was really so. Nature herself was at this unripe time, But secondary to my own pursuits And animal activities, and all Their trivial pleasures; and long afterwards When these had died away, and Nature did For her own sake become my joy, even then And upwards through late youth, until not less Than three and twenty summers had been told Was man in my affections and regards Subordinate to her; her awful forms And viewless agencies: a passion, she! A rapture often, and immediate joy, Ever at hand; he distant, but a grace Occasional, an accidental thought, His hour being not yet come. Far less had then The inferior Creatures, beast or bird, attun'd My spirit to that gentleness of love, Won from me those minute obeisances Of tenderness, which I may number now With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these The light of beauty did not fall in vain, Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end. Why should I speak of Tillers of the soil? The Ploughman and his Team; or Men and Boys In festive summer busy with the rake, Old Men and ruddy Maids, and Little Ones All out together, and in sun and shade Dispers'd among the hay-grounds alder-fringed, The Quarry-man, far heard! that blasts the rock, The Fishermen in pairs, the one to row, And one to drop the Net, plying their trade ‘'Mid tossing lakes and tumbling boats’ and winds Whistling; the Miner, melancholy Man! That works by taper light, while all the hills Are shining with the glory of the day. But when that first poetic Faculty Of plain imagination and severe, No longer a mute Influence of the soul, An Element of Nature's inner self, Began to have some promptings to put on A visible shape, and to the works of art, The notions and the images of books Did knowingly conform itself, by these Enflamed, and proud of that her new delight, There came among those shapes of human life A wilfulness of fancy and conceit Which gave them new importance to the mind; And Nature and her objects beautified These fictions, as in some sort in their turn They burnish'd her. From touch of this new power Nothing was safe: the Elder-tree that grew Beside the well-known Charnel-house had then A dismal look; the Yew-tree had its Ghost, That took its station there for ornament: Then common death was none, common mishap, But matter for this humour everywhere, The tragic super-tragic, else left short. Then, if a Widow, staggering with the blow Of her distress, was known to have made her way To the cold grave in which her Husband slept, One night, or haply more than one, through pain Or half-insensate impotence of mind The fact was caught at greedily, and there She was a visitant the whole year through, Wetting the turf with never-ending tears, And all the storms of Heaven must beat on her. Through wild obliquities could I pursue Among all objects of the fields and groves These cravings; when the Foxglove, one by one, Upwards through every stage of its tall stem, Had shed its bells, and stood by the wayside Dismantled, with a single one, perhaps, Left at the ladder's top, with which the Plant Appeared to stoop, as slender blades of grass Tipp'd with a bead of rain or dew, behold! If such a sight were seen, would Fancy bring Some Vagrant thither with her Babes, and seat her Upon the turf beneath the stately Flower Drooping in sympathy, and making so A melancholy Crest above the head Of the lorn Creature, while her Little-Ones, All unconcerned with her unhappy plight, Were sporting with the purple cups that lay Scatter'd upon the ground. There was a Copse An upright bank of wood and woody rock That opposite our rural Dwelling stood, In which a sparkling patch of diamond light Was in bright weather duly to be seen On summer afternoons, within the wood At the same place. 'Twas doubtless nothing more Than a black rock, which, wet with constant springs Glister'd far seen from out its lurking-place As soon as ever the declining sun Had smitten it. Beside our Cottage hearth, Sitting with open door, a hundred times Upon this lustre have I gaz'd, that seem'd To have some meaning which I could not find; And now it was a burnished shield, I fancied, Suspended over a Knight's Tomb, who lay Inglorious, buried in the dusky wood; An entrance now into some magic cave Or Palace for a Fairy of the rock; Nor would I, though not certain whence the cause Of the effulgence, thither have repair'd Without a precious bribe, and day by day And month by month I saw the spectacle, Nor ever once have visited the spot Unto this hour. Thus sometimes were the shapes Of wilful fancy grafted upon feelings Of the imagination, and they rose In worth accordingly. My present Theme Is to retrace the way that led me on Through Nature to the love of Human Kind; Nor could I with such object overlook The influence of this Power which turn'd itself Instinctively to human passions, things Least understood; of this adulterate Power, For so it may be call'd, and without wrong, When with that first compar'd. Yet in the midst Of these vagaries, with an eye so rich As mine was, through the chance, on me not wasted Of having been brought up in such a grand And lovely region, I had forms distinct To steady me; these thoughts did oft revolve About some centre palpable, which at once Incited them to motion, and control'd, And whatsoever shape the fit might take, And whencesoever it might come, I still At all times had a real solid world Of images about me; did not pine As one in cities bred might do; as Thou, Beloved Friend! hast told me that thou didst, Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams Of sickliness, disjoining, joining things Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm, If, when the Woodman languish'd with disease From sleeping night by night among the woods Within his sod-built Cabin, Indian-wise, I call'd the pangs of disappointed love And all the long Etcetera of such thought To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the Man, If not already from the woods retir'd To die at home, was haply, as I knew, Pining alone among the gentle airs, Birds, running Streams, and Hills so beautiful On golden evenings, while the charcoal Pile Breath'd up its smoke, an image of his ghost Or spirit that full soon must take its flight. There came a time of greater dignity Which had been gradually prepar'd, and now Rush'd in as if on wings, the time in which The pulse of Being everywhere was felt, When all the several frames of things, like stars Through every magnitude distinguishable, Were half confounded in each other's blaze, One galaxy of life and joy. Then rose Man, inwardly contemplated, and present In my own being, to a loftier height; As of all visible natures crown; and first In capability of feeling what Was to be felt; in being rapt away By the divine effect of power and love, As, more than anything we know instinct With Godhead, and by reason and by will Acknowledging dependency sublime. Erelong transported hence as in a dream I found myself begirt with temporal shapes Of vice and folly thrust upon my view, Objects of sport, and ridicule, and scorn, Manners and characters discriminate, And little busy passions that eclips'd, As well they might, the impersonated thought, The idea or abstraction of the Kind. An Idler among academic Bowers, Such was my new condition, as at large Has been set forth; yet here the vulgar light Of present actual superficial life, Gleaming through colouring of other times, Old usages and local privilege, Thereby was soften'd, almost solemnized. And render'd apt and pleasing to the view; This notwithstanding, being brought more near As I was now, to guilt and wretchedness, I trembled, thought of human life at times With an indefinite terror and dismay Such as the storms and angry elements Had bred in me, but gloomier far, a dim Analogy to uproar and misrule, Disquiet, danger, and obscurity. It might be told (but wherefore speak of things Common to all?) that seeing, I essay'd To give relief, began to deem myself A moral agent, judging between good And evil, not as for the mind's delight But for her safety, one who was to act, As sometimes, to the best of my weak means, I did, by human sympathy impell'd; And through dislike and most offensive pain Was to the truth conducted; of this faith Never forsaken, that by acting well And understanding, I should learn to love The end of life and every thing we know. Preceptress stern, that did instruct me next, London! to thee I willingly return. Erewhile my Verse play'd only with the flowers Enwrought upon thy mantle; satisfied With this amusement, and a simple look Of child-like inquisition, now and then Cast upwards on thine eye to puzzle out Some inner meanings, which might harbour there. Yet did I not give way to this light mood Wholly beguiled, as one incapable Of higher things, and ignorant that high things Were round me. Never shall I forget the hour The moment rather say when having thridded The labyrinth of suburban Villages, At length I did unto myself first seem To enter the great City. On the roof Of an itinerant Vehicle I sate With vulgar Men about me, vulgar forms Of houses, pavement, streets, of men and things, Mean shapes on every side: but, at the time, When to myself it fairly might be said, The very moment that I seem'd to know The threshold now is overpass'd, Great God! That aught external to the living mind Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was A weight of Ages did at once descend Upon my heart; no thought embodied, no Distinct remembrances; but weight and power, Power growing with the weight: alas! I feel That I am trifling: 'twas a moment's pause. All that took place within me, came and went As in a moment, and I only now Remember that it was a thing divine. As when a Traveller hath from open day With torches pass'd into some Vault of Earth, The Grotto of Antiparos, or the Den Of Yordas among Craven's mountain tracts; He looks and sees the cavern spread and grow, Widening itself on all sides, sees, or thinks He sees, erelong, the roof above his head, Which instantly unsettles and recedes Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all Commingled, making up a Canopy Of Shapes and Forms and Tendencies to Shape That shift and vanish, change and interchange Like Spectres, ferment quiet and sublime; Which, after a short space, works less and less, Till every effort, every motion gone, The scene before him lies in perfect view, Exposed and lifeless, as a written book. But let him pause awhile, and look again And a new quickening shall succeed, at first Beginning timidly, then creeping fast Through all which he beholds; the senseless mass, In its projections, wrinkles, cavities, Through all its surface, with all colours streaming, Like a magician's airy pageant, parts Unites, embodying everywhere some pressure Or image, recognis'd or new, some type Or picture of the world; forests and lakes, Ships, Rivers, Towers, the Warrior clad in Mail, The prancing Steed, the Pilgrim with his Staff, The mitred Bishop and the throned King, A Spectacle to which there is no end. No otherwise had I at first been moved With such a swell of feeling, follow'd soon By a blank sense of greatness pass'd away And afterwards continu'd to be mov'd In presence of that vast Metropolis, The Fountain of my Country's destiny And of the destiny of Earth itself, That great Emporium, Chronicle at once And Burial-place of passions and their home Imperial, and chief living residence. With strong Sensations, teeming as it did Of past and present, such a place must needs Have pleas'd me, in those times; I sought not then Knowledge; but craved for power, and power I found In all things; nothing had a circumscribed And narrow influence; but all objects, being Themselves capacious, also found in me Capaciousness and amplitude of mind; Such is the strength and glory of our Youth. The Human nature unto which I felt That I belong'd, and which I lov'd and reverenc'd, Was not a punctual Presence, but a Spirit Living in time and space, and far diffus'd. In this my joy, in this my dignity Consisted; the external universe, By striking upon what is found within, Had given me this conception, with the help Of Books, and what they picture and record. 'Tis true the History of my native Land, With those of Greece compar'd and popular Rome, Events not lovely nor magnanimous, But harsh and unaffecting in themselves And in our high-wrought modern narratives Stript of their harmonising soul, the life Of manners and familiar incidents, Had never much delighted me. And less Than other minds I had been used to owe The pleasure which I found in place or thing To extrinsic transitory accidents, Of record or tradition; but a sense Of what had been here done, and suffer'd here Through ages, and was doing, suffering, still Weigh'd with me, could support the test of thought, Was like the enduring majesty and power Of independent nature; and not seldom Even individual remembrances, By working on the Shapes before my eyes, Became like vital functions of the soul; And out of what had been, what was, the place Was thronged with impregnations, like those wilds In which my early feelings had been nurs'd, And naked valleys, full of caverns, rocks, And audible seclusions, dashing lakes, Echoes and Waterfalls, and pointed crags That into music touch the passing wind. Thus here imagination also found An element that pleas'd her, tried her strength, Among new objects simplified, arranged, Impregnated my knowledge, made it live, And the result was elevating thoughts Of human Nature. Neither guilt nor vice, Debasement of the body or the mind, Nor all the misery forced upon my sight, Which was not lightly passed, but often scann'd Most feelingly, could overthrow my trust In what we may become, induce belief That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught, A Solitary, who with vain conceits Had been inspired, and walk'd about in dreams. When from that awful prospect overcast And in eclipse, my meditations turn'd, Lo! everything that was indeed divine Retain'd its purity inviolate And unencroach'd upon, nay, seem'd brighter far For this deep shade in counterview, that gloom Of opposition, such as shew'd itself To the eyes of Adam, yet in Paradise, Though fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw Darkness ere day's mid course, and morning light More orient in the western cloud, that drew ‘O'er the blue firmament a radiant white, Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.’ Add also, that among the multitudes Of that great City, oftentimes was seen Affectingly set forth, more than elsewhere Is possible, the unity of man, One spirit over ignorance and vice Predominant, in good and evil hearts One sense for moral judgements, as one eye For the sun's light. When strongly breath'd upon By this sensation, whencesoe'er it comes Of union or communion doth the soul Rejoice as in her highest joy: for there, There chiefly, hath she feeling whence she is, And, passing through all Nature rests with God. And is not, too, that vast Abiding-place Of human Creatures, turn where'er we may, Profusely sown with individual sights Of courage, and integrity, and truth, And tenderness, which, here set off by foil, Appears more touching. In the tender scenes Chiefly was my delight, and one of these Never will be forgotten. 'Twas a Man, Whom I saw sitting in an open Square Close to an iron paling that fenced in The spacious Grass-plot; on the corner stone Of the low wall in which the pales were fix'd Sate this One Man, and with a sickly babe Upon his knee, whom he had thither brought For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air. Of those who pass'd, and me who look'd at him, He took no note; but in his brawny Arms (The Artificer was to the elbow bare, And from his work this moment had been stolen) He held the Child, and, bending over it, As if he were afraid both of the sun And of the air which he had come to seek, He eyed it with unutterable love. Thus from a very early age, O Friend! My thoughts had been attracted more and more By slow gradations towards human kind And to the good and ill of human life; Nature had led me on, and now I seem'd To travel independent of her help, As if I had forgotten her; but no, My Fellow beings still were unto me Far less than she was, though the scale of love Were filling fast, 'twas light, as yet, compared With that in which her mighty objects lay. BOOK NINTH RESIDENCE IN FRANCE As oftentimes a River, it might seem, Yielding in part to old remembrances, Part sway'd by fear to tread an onward road That leads direct to the devouring sea Turns, and will measure back his course, far back, Towards the very regions which he cross'd In his first outset; so have we long time Made motions retrograde, in like pursuit Detain'd. But now we start afresh; I feel An impulse to precipitate my Verse. Fair greetings to this shapeless eagerness, Whene'er it comes, needful in work so long, Thrice needful to the argument which now Awaits us; Oh! how much unlike the past! One which though bright the promise, will be found Ere far we shall advance, ungenial, hard To treat of, and forbidding in itself. Free as a colt at pasture on the hill, I ranged at large, through the Metropolis Month after month. Obscurely did I live, Not courting the society of Men By literature, or elegance, or rank Distinguish'd; in the midst of things, it seem'd, Looking as from a distance on the world That mov'd about me; yet insensibly False preconceptions were corrected thus And errors of the fancy rectified, Alike with reference to men and things, And sometimes from each quarter were pour'd in Novel imaginations and profound. A year thus spent, this field (with small regret Save only for the Book-stalls in the streets, Wild produce, hedge-row fruit, on all sides hung To tempt the sauntering traveller from his track) I quitted, and betook myself to France, Led thither chiefly by a personal wish To speak the language more familiarly, With which intent I chose for my abode A City on the Borders of the Loire. Through Paris lay my readiest path, and there I sojourn'd a few days, and visited In haste each spot of old and recent fame The latter chiefly, from the field of Mars Down to the suburbs of St. Anthony, And from Mont Martyr southward, to the Dome Of Geneviève. In both her clamorous Halls, The National Synod and the Jacobins I saw the revolutionary Power Toss like a Ship at anchor, rock'd by storms; The Arcades I traversed in the Palace huge Of Orleans, coasted round and round the line Of Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop, Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk Of all who had a purpose, or had not; I star'd and listen'd with a stranger's ears To Hawkers and Haranguers, hubbub wild! And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes, In knots, or pairs, or single, ant-like swarms Of Builders and Subverters, every face That hope or apprehension could put on, Joy, anger, and vexation in the midst Of gaiety and dissolute idleness. Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust Of the Bastille, I sate in the open sun, And from the rubbish gather'd up a stone And pocketed the relick in the guise Of an enthusiast, yet, in honest truth Though not without some strong incumbencies; And glad, (could living man be otherwise) I look'd for something that I could not find, Affecting more emotion than I felt, For 'tis most certain that the utmost force Of all these various objects which may shew The temper of my mind as then it was Seem'd less to recompense the Traveller's pains, Less mov'd me, gave me less delight than did, Among other sights, the Magdalene of le Brun, A Beauty exquisitely wrought, fair face And rueful, with its ever-flowing tears. But hence to my more permanent residence I hasten; there, by novelties in speech Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks, And all the attire of ordinary life, Attention was at first engross'd; and thus, Amused and satisfied, I scarcely felt The shock of these concussions, unconcerned, Tranquil, almost, and careless as a flower Glassed in a Green-house, or a Parlour shrub While every bush and tree, the country through, Is shaking to the roots; indifference this Which may seem strange; but I was unprepared With needful knowledge, had abruptly pass'd Into a theatre, of which the stage Was busy with an action far advanced. Like others I had read, and eagerly Sometimes, the master Pamphlets of the day; Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild Upon that meagre soil, help'd out by Talk And public News; but having never chanced To see a regular Chronicle which might shew, (If any such indeed existed then) Whence the main Organs of the public Power Had sprung, their transmigrations when and how Accomplish'd, giving thus unto events A form and body, all things were to me Loose and disjointed, and the affections left Without a vital interest. At that time, Moreover, the first storm was overblown, And the strong hand of outward violence Lock'd up in quiet. For myself, I fear Now in connection with so great a Theme To speak (as I must be compell'd to do) Of one so unimportant; a short time I loiter'd, and frequented night by night Routs, card-tables, the formal haunts of Men, Whom in the City privilege of birth Sequester'd from the rest, societies Where, through punctilios of elegance And deeper causes, all discourse, alike Of good and evil of the time, was shunn'd With studious care; but 'twas not long ere this Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew Into a noisier world; and thus did soon Become a Patriot, and my heart was all Given to the People, and my love was theirs. A knot of military Officers, That to a Regiment appertain'd which then Was station'd in the City, were the chief Of my associates: some of these wore Swords Which had been seasoned in the Wars, and all Were men well-born, at least laid claim to such Distinction, as the Chivalry of France. In age and temper differing, they had yet One spirit ruling in them all, alike (Save only one, hereafter to be nam'd) Were bent upon undoing what was done: This was their rest, and only hope, therewith No fear had they of bad becoming worse, For worst to them was come, nor would have stirr'd, Or deem'd it worth a moment's while to stir, In anything, save only as the act Look'd thitherward. One, reckoning by years, Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile He had sate Lord in many tender hearts, Though heedless of such honours now, and chang'd: His temper was quite master'd by the times, And they had blighted him, had eat away The beauty of his person, doing wrong Alike to body and to mind: his port, Which once had been erect and open, now Was stooping and contracted, and a face, By nature lovely in itself, express'd As much as any that was ever seen, A ravage out of season, made by thoughts Unhealthy and vexatious. At the hour, The most important of each day, in which The public News was read, the fever came, A punctual visitant, to shake this Man, Disarm'd his voice, and fann'd his yellow cheek Into a thousand colours; while he read, Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch Continually, like an uneasy place In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour Of universal ferment; mildest men Were agitated; and commotions, strife Of passion and opinion fill'd the walls Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds. The soil of common life was at that time Too hot to tread upon; oft said I then, And not then only, ‘what a mockery this Of history, the past and that to come! Now do I feel how I have been deceived, Reading of Nations and their works, in faith, Faith given to vanity and emptiness; Oh! laughter for the Page that would reflect To future times the face of what now is!’ The land all swarm'd with passion, like a Plain Devour'd by locusts, Carra, Gorsas, add A hundred other names, forgotten now, Nor to be heard of more, yet were they Powers, Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day, And felt through every nook of town and field. The Men already spoken of as chief Of my Associates were prepared for flight To augment the band of Emigrants in Arms Upon the borders of the Rhine, and leagued With foreign Foes mustered for instant war. This was their undisguis'd intent, and they Were waiting with the whole of their desires The moment to depart. An Englishman, Born in a Land, the name of which appear'd To license some unruliness of mind, A Stranger, with Youth's further privilege, And that indulgence which a half-learn'd speech Wins from the courteous, I who had been else Shunn'd and not tolerated freely lived With these Defenders of the Crown, and talk'd And heard their notions, nor did they disdain The wish to bring me over to their cause. But though untaught by thinking or by books To reason well of polity or law And nice distinctions, then on every tongue, Of natural rights and civil, and to acts Of Nations, and their passing interests, (I speak comparing these with other things) Almost indifferent, even the Historian's Tale Prizing but little otherwise than I priz'd Tales of the Poets, as it made my heart Beat high and fill'd my fancy with fair forms, Old Heroes and their sufferings and their deeds; Yet in the regal Sceptre, and the pomp Of Orders and Degrees, I nothing found Then, or had ever, even in crudest youth, That dazzled me; but rather what my soul Mourn'd for, or loath'd, beholding that the best Rul'd not, and feeling that they ought to rule. For, born in a poor District, and which yet Retaineth more of ancient homeliness, Manners erect, and frank simplicity, Than any other nook of English Land, It was my fortune scarcely to have seen Through the whole tenor of my School-day time The face of one, who, whether Boy or Man, Was vested with attention or respect Through claims of wealth or blood; nor was it least Of many debts which afterwards I owed To Cambridge, and an academic life That something there was holden up to view Of a Republic, where all stood thus far Upon equal ground, that they were brothers all In honour, as in one community, Scholars and Gentlemen, where, furthermore, Distinction lay open to all that came, And wealth and titles were in less esteem Than talents and successful industry. Add unto this, subservience from the first To God and Nature's single sovereignty, Familiar presences of awful Power And fellowship with venerable books To sanction the proud workings of the soul, And mountain liberty. It could not be But that one tutor'd thus, who had been form'd To thought and moral feeling in the way This story hath described, should look with awe Upon the faculties of Man, receive Gladly the highest promises, and hail As best the government of equal rights And individual worth. And hence, O Friend! If at the first great outbreak I rejoiced Less than might well befit my youth, the cause In part lay here, that unto me the events Seemed nothing out of nature's certain course, A gift that rather was come late than soon. No wonder, then, if advocates like these Whom I have mention'd, at this riper day Were impotent to make my hopes put on The shape of theirs, my understanding bend In honour to their honour, zeal which yet Had slumber'd, now in opposition burst Forth like a Polar Summer; every word They utter'd was a dart, by counter-winds Blown back upon themselves, their reason seem'd Confusion-stricken by a higher power Than human understanding, their discourse Maim'd, spiritless, and in their weakness strong I triumph'd. Meantime, day by day, the roads (While I consorted with these Royalists) Were crowded with the bravest Youth of France, And all the promptest of her Spirits, link'd In gallant Soldiership, and posting on To meet the War upon her Frontier Bounds. Yet at this very moment do tears start Into mine eyes; I do not say I weep, I wept not then, but tears have dimm'd my sight, In memory of the farewells of that time, Domestic severings, female fortitude At dearest separation, patriot love And self-devotion, and terrestrial hope Encourag'd with a martyr's confidence; Even files of Strangers merely, seen but once, And for a moment, men from far with sound Of music, martial tunes, and banners spread Entering the city, here and there a face Or person singled out among the rest, Yet still a Stranger and belov'd as such, Even by these passing spectacles my heart Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seem'd Arguments sent from Heaven, that 'twas a cause Good, and which no one could stand up against Who was not lost, abandon'd, selfish, proud, Mean, miserable, wilfully deprav'd, Hater perverse of equity and truth. Among that band of Officers was one Already hinted at, of other mold, A Patriot, thence rejected by the rest And with an oriental loathing spurn'd, As of a different caste. A meeker Man Than this liv'd never, or a more benign Meek, though enthusiastic. Injuries Made him more gracious, and his nature then Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly As aromatic flowers on alpine turf When foot hath crush'd them. He thro' the events Of that great change wander'd in perfect faith, As through a Book, an old Romance or Tale Of Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought Behind the summer clouds. By birth he rank'd With the most noble, but unto the poor Among mankind he was in service bound As by some tie invisible, oaths profess'd To a religious Order. Man he lov'd As Man; and to the mean and the obscure And all the homely in their homely works Transferr'd a courtesy which had no air Of condescension, but did rather seem A passion and a gallantry, like that Which he, a Soldier, in his idler day Had pay'd to Woman; somewhat vain he was, Or seem'd so, yet it was not vanity But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy That cover'd him about when he was bent On works of love or freedom, or revolved Complacently the progress of a cause, Whereof he was a part; yet this was meek And placid, and took nothing from the Man That was delightful: oft in solitude With him did I discourse about the end Of civil government, and its wisest forms, Of ancient prejudice, and chartered rights, Allegiance, faith, and law by time matured, Custom and habit, novelty and change, Of self-respect, and virtue in the Few For patrimonial honour set apart, And ignorance in the labouring Multitude. For he, an upright Man and tolerant, Balanced these contemplations in his mind And I, who at that time was scarcely dipp'd Into the turmoil, had a sounder judgment Than afterwards, carried about me yet With less alloy to its integrity The experience of past ages, as through help Of Books and common life it finds its way To youthful minds, by objects over near Not press'd upon, nor dazzled or misled By struggling with the crowd for present ends. But though not deaf and obstinate to find Error without apology on the side Of those who were against us, more delight We took, and let this freely be confess'd, In painting to ourselves the miseries Of royal Courts, and that voluptuous life Unfeeling, where the Man who is of soul The meanest thrives the most, where dignity, True personal dignity, abideth not, A light and cruel world, cut off from all The natural inlets of just sentiment, From lowly sympathy, and chastening truth, Where good and evil never have that name, That which they ought to have, but wrong prevails, And vice at home. We added dearest themes, Man and his noble nature, as it is The gift of God and lies in his own power, His blind desires and steady faculties Capable of clear truth, the one to break Bondage, the other to build Liberty On firm foundations, making social life, Through knowledge spreading and imperishable, As just in regulation, and as pure As individual in the wise and good. We summon'd up the honorable deeds Of ancient Story, thought of each bright spot That could be found in all recorded time Of truth preserv'd and error pass'd away, Of single Spirits that catch the flame from Heaven, And how the multitude of men will feed And fan each other, thought of Sects, how keen They are to put the appropriate nature on, Triumphant over every obstacle Of custom, language, Country, love and hate, And what they do and suffer for their creed, How far they travel, and how long endure, How quickly mighty Nations have been form'd From least beginnings, how, together lock'd By new opinions, scatter'd tribes have made One body spreading wide as clouds in heaven. To aspirations then of our own minds Did we appeal; and finally beheld A living confirmation of the whole Before us in a People risen up Fresh as the morning Star: elate we look'd Upon their virtues, saw in rudest men Self-sacrifice the firmest, generous love And continence of mind, and sense of right Uppermost in the midst of fiercest strife. Oh! sweet it is, in academic Groves, Or such retirement, Friend! as we have known Among the mountains, by our Rotha's Stream, Greta or Derwent, or some nameless Rill, To ruminate with interchange of talk On rational liberty, and hope in Man, Justice and peace; but far more sweet such toil, Toil say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse If Nature then be standing on the brink Of some great trial, and we hear the voice Of One devoted, one whom circumstance Hath call'd upon to embody his deep sense In action, give it outwardly a shape, And that of benediction to the world; Then doubt is not, and truth is more than truth, A hope it is and a desire, a creed Of zeal by an authority divine Sanction'd of danger, difficulty or death. Such conversation under Attic shades Did Dion hold with Plato, ripen'd thus For a Deliverer's glorious task, and such, He, on that ministry already bound, Held with Eudemus and Timonides, Surrounded by Adventurers in Arms, When those two Vessels with their daring Freight For the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow Sail'd from Zacynthus, philosophic war Led by Philosophers. With harder fate, Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend! Of whom I speak, so Beaupuis (let the Name Stand near the worthiest of Antiquity) Fashion'd his life, and many a long discourse With like persuasion honor'd we maintain'd, He on his part accoutred for the worst. He perish'd fighting in supreme command Upon the Borders of the unhappy Loire For Liberty against deluded Men, His Fellow-countrymen, and yet most bless'd In this, that he the fate of later times Lived not to see, nor what we now behold Who have as ardent hearts as he had then. Along that very Loire, with Festivals Resounding at all hours, and innocent yet Of civil slaughter was our frequent walk Or in wide Forests of the neighbourhood, High woods and over-arch'd with open space On every side, and footing many a mile, In woven roots and moss smooth as the sea, A solemn region. Often in such place From earnest dialogues I slipp'd in thought And let remembrance steal to other times When Hermits from their sheds and caves forth stray'd Walk'd by themselves, so met in shades like these, And if a devious Traveller was heard Approaching from a distance, as might chance, With speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs From the hard floor reverberated, then It was Angelica thundering through the woods Upon her Palfrey, or that gentler Maid Erminia, fugitive as fair as She. Sometimes I saw, methought, a pair of Knights Joust underneath the trees, that, as in storm, Did rock above their heads; anon the din Of boisterous merriment and music's roar, With sudden Proclamation, burst from haunt Of Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance Rejoicing o'er a Female in the midst, A mortal Beauty, their unhappy Thrall; The width of those huge Forests, unto me A novel scene, did often in this way Master my fancy, while I wander'd on With that revered Companion. And sometimes When to a Convent in a meadow green By a brook-side we came, a roofless Pile, And not by reverential touch of Time Dismantled, but by violence abrupt, In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies, In spite of real fervour, and of that Less genuine and wrought up within myself I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh, And for the matin Bell to sound no more Griev'd, and the evening Taper, and the Cross High on the topmost Pinnacle, a sign Admonitory to the Traveller First seen above the woods. And when my Friend Pointed upon occasion to the Site Of Romorentin, home of ancient Kings, To the imperial Edifice of Blois Or to that rural Castle, name now slipp'd From my remembrance, where a Lady lodg'd By the first Francis wooed, and bound to him In chains of mutual passion; from the Tower, As a Tradition of the Country tells, Practis'd to commune with her Royal Knight By cressets and love-beacons, intercourse 'Twixt her high-seated Residence and his Far off at Chambord on the Plain beneath: Even here, though less than with the peaceful House Religious, 'mid those frequent monuments Of Kings, their vices and their better deeds, Imagination, potent to enflame At times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn, Did also often mitigate the force Of civic prejudice, the bigotry, So call it, of a youthful Patriot's mind, And on these spots with many gleams I look'd Of chivalrous delight. Yet not the less, Hatred of absolute rule, where will of One Is law for all, and of that barren pride In them who, by immunities unjust, Betwixt the Sovereign and the People stand, His helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold Daily upon me, mix'd with pity too And love; for where hope is there love will be For the abject multitude. And when we chanc'd One day to meet a hunger-bitten Girl, Who crept along, fitting her languid gait Unto a Heifer's motion, by a cord Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane Its sustenance, while the girl with her two hands Was busy knitting, in a heartless mood Of solitude, and at the sight my Friend In agitation said, ‘'Tis against that Which we are fighting,’ I with him believed Devoutly that a spirit was abroad Which could not be withstood, that poverty At least like this, would in a little time Be found no more, that we should see the earth Unthwarted in her wish to recompense The industrious, and the lowly Child of Toil, All institutes for ever blotted out That legalised exclusion, empty pomp Abolish'd, sensual state and cruel power Whether by edict of the one or few, And finally, as sum and crown of all, Should see the People having a strong hand In making their own Laws, whence better days To all mankind. But, these things set apart, Was not the single confidence enough To animate the mind that ever turn'd A thought to human welfare, that henceforth Captivity by mandate without law Should cease, and open accusation lead To sentence in the hearing of the world And open punishment, if not the air Be free to breathe in, and the heart of Man Dread nothing? Having touch'd this argument I shall not, as my purpose was, take note Of other matters which detain'd us oft In thought or conversation, public acts, And public persons, and the emotions wrought Within our minds by the ever-varying wind Of Record or Report which day by day Swept over us; but I will here instead Draw from obscurity a tragic Tale Not in its spirit singular indeed But haply worth memorial, as I heard The events related by my patriot Friend And others who had borne a part therein. Oh! happy time of youthful Lovers! thus My Story may begin, Oh! balmy time In which a Love-knot on a Lady's brow Is fairer than the fairest Star in heaven! To such inheritance of blessedness Young Vaudracour was brought by years that had A little overstepp'd his stripling prime. A Town of small repute in the heart of France Was the Youth's Birth-place: there he vow'd his love To Julia, a bright Maid, from Parents sprung Not mean in their condition; but with rights Unhonour'd of Nobility, and hence The Father of the young Man, who had place Among that order, spurn'd the very thought Of such alliance. From their cradles up, With but a step between their several homes The pair had thriven together year by year, Friends, Playmates, Twins in pleasure, after strife And petty quarrels had grown fond again, Each other's advocate, each other's help, Nor ever happy if they were apart: A basis this for deep and solid love, And endless constancy, and placid truth; But whatsoever of such treasures might, Beneath the outside of their youth, have lain Reserv'd for mellower years, his present mind Was under fascination; he beheld A vision, and he lov'd the thing he saw. Arabian Fiction never fill'd the world With half the wonders that were wrought for him. Earth liv'd in one great presence of the spring, Life turn'd the meanest of her implements Before his eyes to price above all gold, The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine, Her chamber-window did surpass in glory The portals of the East, all paradise Could by the simple opening of a door Let itself in upon him, pathways, walks, Swarm'd with enchantment till his spirit sank Beneath the burthen, overbless'd for life. This state was theirs, till whether through effect Of some delirious hour, or that the Youth, Seeing so many bars betwixt himself And the dear haven where he wish'd to be In honourable wedlock with his love Without a certain knowledge of his own, Was inwardly prepared to turn aside From law and custom, and entrust himself To Nature for a happy end of all; And thus abated of that pure reserve Congenial to his loyal heart, with which It would have pleas'd him to attend the steps Of Maiden so divinely beautiful I know not, but reluctantly must add That Julia, yet without the name of Wife Carried about her for a secret grief The promise of a Mother. To conceal The threaten'd shame the Parents of the Maid Found means to hurry her away by night And unforewarn'd, that in a distant Town She might remain shrouded in privacy, Until the Babe was born. When morning came The Lover thus bereft, stung with his loss And all uncertain whither he should turn Chafed like a wild beast in the toils; at length, Following as his suspicions led, he found O joy! sure traces of the fugitives, Pursu'd them to the Town where they had stopp'd, And lastly to the very House itself Which had been chosen for the Maid's retreat. The sequel may be easily divined, Walks backwards, forwards, morning, noon and night When decency and caution would allow And Julia, who, whenever to herself She happen'd to be left a moment's space, Was busy at her casement, as a Swallow About its nest, ere long did thus espy Her Lover, thence a stolen interview By night accomplish'd, with a ladder's help. I pass the raptures of the Pair; such theme Hath by a hundred Poets been set forth In more delightful verse than skill of mine Could fashion, chiefly by that darling Bard Who told of Juliet and her Romeo, And of the Lark's note heard before its time, And of the streaks that lac'd the severing clouds In the unrelenting East. 'Tis mine to tread The humbler province of plain history, And, without choice of circumstance, submissively Relate what I have heard. The Lovers came To this resolve, with which they parted, pleas'd And confident, that Vaudracour should hie Back to his Father's house, and there employ Means aptest to obtain a sum of gold, A final portion, even, if that might be, Which done, together they could then take flight To some remote and solitary place Where they might live with no one to behold Their happiness, or to disturb their love. Immediately, and with this mission charg'd Home to his Father's House the Youth return'd And there remain'd a while without hint given Of his design; but if a word were dropp'd Touching the matter of his passion, still In hearing of his Father, Vaudracour Persisted openly that nothing less Than death should make him yield up hope to be A blessed Husband of the Maid he loved. Incensed at such obduracy and slight Of exhortations and remonstrances The Father threw out threats that by a mandate Bearing the private signet of the State He should be baffled of his mad intent, And that should cure him. From this time the Youth Conceiv'd a terror, and by night or day Stirr'd nowhere without Arms. Soon afterwards His Parents to their Country Seat withdrew Upon some feign'd occasion; and the Son Was left with one Attendant in the house. Retiring to his Chamber for the night, While he was entering at the door, attempts Were made to seize him by three armed Men, The instruments of ruffian power; the Youth In the first impulse of his rage, laid one Dead at his feet, and to the second gave A perilous wound, which done, at sight Of the dead Man, he peacefully resign'd His Person to the Law, was lodged in prison, And wore the fetters of a Criminal. Through three week's space, by means which love devis'd, The Maid in her seclusion had received Tidings of Vaudracour, and how he sped Upon his enterprize. Thereafter came A silence, half a circle did the moon Complete, and then a whole, and still the same Silence; a thousand thousand fears and hopes Stirr'd in her mind; thoughts waking, thoughts of sleep Entangled in each other, and at last Self-slaughter seem'd her only resting-place. So did she fare in her uncertainty. At length, by interference of a Friend, One who had sway at Court, the Youth regain'd His liberty, on promise to sit down Quietly in his Father's House, nor take One step to reunite himself with her Of whom his Parents disapproved: hard law To which he gave consent only because His freedom else could nowise be procured. Back to his Father's house he went, remain'd Eight days, and then his resolution fail'd: He fled to Julia, and the words with which He greeted her were these. ‘All right is gone, Gone from me. Thou no longer now art mine, I thine; a Murderer, Julia, cannot love An innocent Woman; I behold thy face I see thee and my misery is complete.’ She could not give him answer; afterwards She coupled with his Father's name some words Of vehement indignation; but the Youth Check'd her, nor would he hear of this; for thought Unfilial, or unkind, had never once Found harbour in his breast. The Lovers thus United once again together lived For a few days, which were to Vaudracour Days of dejection, sorrow and remorse For that ill deed of violence which his hand Had hastily committed: for the Youth Was of a loyal spirit, a conscience nice And over tender for the trial which His fate had call'd him to. The Father's mind, Meanwhile, remain'd unchanged, and Vaudracour Learn'd that a mandate had been newly issued To arrest him on the spot. Oh pain it was To part! he could not—and he linger'd still To the last moment of his time, and then, At dead of night with snow upon the ground, He left the City, and in Villages The most sequester'd of the neighbourhood Lay hidden for the space of several days Until the horseman bringing back report That he was nowhere to be found, the search Was ended. Back return'd the ill-fated Youth, And from the House where Julia lodg'd (to which He now found open ingress, having gain'd The affection of the family, who lov'd him Both for his own, and for the Maiden's sake) One night retiring, he was seiz'd—But here A portion of the Tale may well be left In silence, though my memory could add Much how the Youth, and in short space of time, Was travers'd from without, much, too, of thoughts By which he was employ'd in solitude Under privation and restraint, and what Through dark and shapeless fear of things to come, And what through strong compunction for the past He suffer'd breaking down in heart and mind. Such grace, if grace it were, had been vouchsafed Or such effect had through the Father's want Of power, or through his negligence ensued That Vaudracour was suffer'd to remain, Though under guard and without liberty, In the same City with the unhappy Maid From whom he was divided. So they fared Objects of general concern, till, moved With pity for their wrongs, the Magistrate, The same who had plac'd the Youth in custody, By application to the Minister Obtain'd his liberty upon condition That to his Father's house he should return. He left his Prison almost on the eve Of Julia's travail; she had likewise been As from the time indeed, when she had first Been brought for secresy to this abode, Though treated with consoling tenderness, Herself a Prisoner, a dejected one, Fill'd with a Lover's and a Woman's fears, And whensoe'er the Mistress of the House Enter'd the Room for the last time at night And Julia with a low and plaintive voice Said ‘You are coming then to lock me up’ The Housewife when these words, always the same, Were by her Captive languidly pronounced Could never hear them utter'd without tears. A day or two before her Child-bed time Was Vaudracour restored to her, and soon As he might be permitted to return Into her Chamber after the Child's birth The Master of the Family begg'd that all The household might be summon'd, doubting not But that they might receive impressions then Friendly to human kindness. Vaudracour (This heard I from one present at the time) Held up the new-born Infant in his arms And kiss'd, and bless'd, and cover'd it with tears, Uttering a prayer that he might never be As wretched as his Father; then he gave The Child to her who bare it, and she too Repeated the same prayer, took it again And muttering something faintly afterwards He gave the Infant to the Standers-by, And wept in silence upon Julia's neck. Two months did he continue in the House, And often yielded up himself to plans Of future happiness. ‘You shall return, Julia,’ said he, ‘and to your Father's House Go with your Child, you have been wretched, yet It is a town where both of us were born, None will reproach you, for our loves are known, With ornaments the prettiest you shall dress Your Boy, as soon as he can run about, And when he thus is at his play my Father Will see him from the window, and the Child Will by his beauty move his Grandsire's heart, So that it shall be soften'd, and our loves End happily, as they began.’ These gleams Appear'd but seldom; oftener was he seen Propping a pale and melancholy face Upon the Mother's bosom, resting thus His head upon one breast, while from the other The Babe was drawing in its quiet food. At other times, when he, in silence, long And fixedly had look'd upon her face, He would exclaim, ‘Julia, how much thine eyes Have cost me!’ During day-time when the Child Lay in its cradle, by its side he sate, Not quitting it an instant. The whole Town In his unmerited misfortunes now Took part, and if he either at the door Or window for a moment with his Child Appear'd, immediately the Street was throng'd While others frequently without reserve Pass'd and repass'd before the house to steal A look at him. Oft at this time he wrote Requesting, since he knew that the consent Of Julia's Parents never could be gain'd To a clandestine marriage, that his Father Would from the birthright of an eldest Son Exclude him, giving but, when this was done, A sanction to his nuptials: vain request, To which no answer was return'd. And now From her own home the Mother of his Love Arrived to apprise the Daughter of her fix'd And last resolve, that, since all hope to move The old Man's heart prov'd vain, she must retire Into a Convent, and be there immured. Julia was thunderstricken by these words, And she insisted on a Mother's rights To take her Child along with her, a grant Impossible, as she at last perceived; The Persons of the house no sooner heard Of this decision upon Julia's fate Than everyone was overwhelm'd with grief Nor could they frame a manner soft enough To impart the tidings to the Youth; but great Was their astonishment when they beheld him Receive the news in calm despondency, Composed and silent, without outward sign Of even the least emotion; seeing this When Julia scatter'd some upbraiding words Upon his slackness he thereto return'd No answer, only took the Mother's hand Who lov'd him scarcely less than her own Child, And kissed it, without seeming to be press'd By any pain that 'twas the hand of one Whose errand was to part him from his Love For ever. In the city he remain'd A season after Julia had retired And in the Convent taken up her home To the end that he might place his Infant Babe With a fit Nurse, which done, beneath the roof Where now his little One was lodg'd, he pass'd The day entire, and scarcely could at length Tear himself from the cradle to return Home to his Father's House, in which he dwelt Awhile, and then came back that he might see Whether the Babe had gain'd sufficient strength To bear removal. He quitted the same Town For the last time, attendant by the side Of a close chair, a Litter or Sedan, In which the Child was carried. To a hill, Which rose at a League's distance from the Town, The Family of the house where he had lodged Attended him, and parted from him there, Watching below till he had disappeared On the hill top. His eyes he scarcely took, Through all that journey, from the Chair in which The Babe was carried; and at every Inn Or place at which they halted or reposed Laid him upon his knees, nor would permit The hands of any but himself to dress The Infant or undress. By one of those Who bore the Chair these facts, at his return, Were told, and in relating them he wept. This was the manner in which Vaudracour Departed with his Infant; and thus reach'd His Father's House, where to the innocent Child Admittance was denied. The young Man spake No word of indignation or reproof, But of his Father begg'd, a last request, That a retreat might be assigned to him, A house where in the Country he might dwell With such allowance as his wants required And the more lonely that the Mansion was 'Twould be more welcome. To a lodge that stood Deep in a Forest, with leave given, at the age Of four and twenty summers he retir'd; And thither took with him his Infant Babe, And one Domestic for their common needs, An aged woman. It consoled him here To attend upon the Orphan and perform The office of a Nurse to his young Child Which after a short time by some mistake Or indiscretion of the Father, died. The Tale I follow to its last recess Of suffering or of peace, I know not which; Theirs be the blame who caused the woe, not mine. From that time forth he never utter'd word To any living. An Inhabitant Of that same Town in which the Pair had left So lively a remembrance of their griefs By chance of business coming within reach Of his retirement to the spot repair'd With the intent to visit him: he reach'd The house and only found the Matron there, Who told him that his pains were thrown away, For that her Master never uttered word To living soul—not even to her. Behold While they were speaking, Vaudracour approach'd; But, seeing some one there, just as his hand Was stretch'd towards the garden-gate, he shrunk, And like a shadow glided out of view. Shock'd at his savage outside, from the place The Visitor retired. Thus liv'd the Youth Cut off from all intelligence with Man, And shunning even the light of common day; Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France Soon afterwards resounded, public hope, Or personal memory of his own deep wrongs, Rouse him: but in those solitary shades His days he wasted, an imbecile mind. BOOK TENTH RESIDENCE IN FRANCE AND FRENCH REVOLUTION It was a beautiful and silent day That overspread the countenance of earth, Then fading, with unusual quietness, When from the Loire I parted, and through scenes Of vineyard, orchard, meadow-ground and tilth, Calm waters, gleams of sun, and breathless trees Towards the fierce Metropolis turn'd my steps Their homeward way to England. From his Throne The King had fallen; the congregated Host, Dire cloud upon the front of which was written The tender mercies of the dismal wind That bore it, on the Plains of Liberty Had burst innocuously, say more, the swarm That came elate and jocund, like a Band Of Eastern Hunters, to enfold in ring Narrowing itself by moments and reduce To the last punctual spot of their despair A race of victims, so they seem'd, themselves Had shrunk from sight of their own task, and fled In terror; desolation and dismay Remained for them whose fancies had grown rank With evil expectations, confidence And perfect triumph to the better cause. The State, as if to stamp the final seal On her security, and to the world Shew what she was, a high and fearless soul, Or rather in a spirit of thanks to those Who had stirr'd up her slackening faculties To a new transition, had assumed with joy The body and the venerable name Of a Republic: lamentable crimes 'Tis true had gone before this hour, the work Of massacre, in which the senseless sword Was pray'd to as a judge; but these were past, Earth free from them for ever, as was thought, Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once; Things that could only shew themselves and die. This was the time in which enflam'd with hope, To Paris I returned. Again I rang'd More eagerly than I had done before Through the wide City, and in progress pass'd The Prison where the unhappy Monarch lay, Associate with his Children and his Wife In bondage; and the Palace lately storm'd With roar of cannon, and a numerous host. I crossed (a black and empty area then) The Square of the Carrousel, few weeks back Heap'd up with dead and dying, upon these And other sights looking as doth a man Upon a volume whose contents he knows Are memorable, but from him lock'd up, Being written in a tongue he cannot read, So that he questions the mute leaves with pain And half upbraids their silence. But that night When on my bed I lay, I was most mov'd And felt most deeply in what world I was; My room was high and lonely, near the roof Of a large Mansion or Hotel, a spot That would have pleased me in more quiet times, Nor was it wholly without pleasure then. With unextinguish'd taper I kept watch, Reading at intervals; the fear gone by Press'd on me almost like a fear to come; I thought of those September Massacres, Divided from me by a little month, And felt and touch'd them, a substantial dread; The rest was conjured up from tragic fictions, And mournful Calendars of true history, Remembrances and dim admonishments. ‘The horse is taught his manage, and the wind Of heaven wheels round and treads in his own steps, Year follows year, the tide returns again, Day follows day, all things have second birth; The earthquake is not satisfied at once.’ And in such way I wrought upon myself, Until I seem'd to hear a voice that cried, To the whole City, ‘Sleep no more.’ To this Add comments of a calmer mind, from which I could not gather full security, But at the best it seem'd a place of fear Unfit for the repose which night requires, Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam. Betimes next morning to the Palace Walk Of Orleans I repair'd and entering there Was greeted, among divers other notes, By voices of the Hawkers in the crowd Bawling, Denunciation of the crimes Of Maximilian Robespierre; the speech Which in their hands they carried was the same Which had been recently pronounced, the day When Robespierre, well knowing for what mark Some words of indirect reproof had been Intended, rose in hardihood, and dared The Man who had an ill surmise of him To bring his charge in openness, whereat When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirr'd, In silence of all present, from his seat Louvet walked singly through the avenue And took his station in the Tribune, saying, ‘I, Robespierre, accuse thee!’ 'Tis well known What was the issue of that charge, and how Louvet was left alone without support Of his irresolute Friends; but these are things Of which I speak, only as they were storm Or sunshine to my individual mind, No further. Let me then relate that now In some sort seeing with my proper eyes That Liberty, and Life, and Death would soon To the remotest corners of the land Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled The capital City, what was struggled for, And by what Combatants victory must be won, The indecision on their part whose aim Seem'd best, and the straightforward path of those Who in attack or in defence alike Were strong through their impiety, greatly I Was agitated; yea I could almost Have pray'd that throughout earth upon all souls By patient exercise of reason made Worthy of liberty, upon every soul Matured to live in plainness and in truth The gift of tongues might fall, and men arrive From the four quarters of the winds to do For France what without help she could not do, A work of honour; think not that to this I added, work of safety; from such thought And the least fear about the end of things I was as far as Angels are from guilt. Yet did I grieve, nor only griev'd, but thought Of opposition and of remedies, An insignificant Stranger, and obscure, Mean as I was, and little graced with power Of eloquence even in my native speech, And all unfit for tumult or intrigue, Yet would I willingly have taken up A service at this time for cause so great, However dangerous. Inly I revolv'd How much the destiny of man had still Hung upon single persons, that there was, Transcendent to all local patrimony, One Nature as there is one Sun in heaven, That objects, even as they are great, thereby Do come within the reach of humblest eyes, That Man was only weak through his mistrust And want of hope, where evidence divine Proclaim'd to him that hope should be most sure, That, with desires heroic and firm sense, A Spirit thoroughly faithful to itself, Unquenchable, unsleeping, undismay'd, Was as an instinct among Men, a stream That gather'd up each petty straggling rill And vein of water, glad to be roll'd on In safe obedience, that a mind whose rest Was where it ought to be, in self-restraint, In circumspection and simplicity, Fell rarely in entire discomfiture Below its aim, or met with from without A treachery that defeated it or foil'd. On the other side, I called to mind those truths Which are the commonplaces of the Schools, A theme for boys, too trite even to be felt, Yet, with a revelation's liveliness, In all their comprehensive bearings known And visible to Philosophers of old, Men who, to business of the world untrain'd, Liv'd in the Shade, and to Harmodius known And his Compeer Aristogiton, known To Brutus, that tyrannic Power is weak, Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor love, Nor the support of good or evil men To trust in, that the Godhead which is ours Can never utterly be charm'd or still'd, That nothing hath a natural right to last But equity and reason, that all else Meets foes irreconcilable, and at best Doth live but by variety of disease. Well might my wishes be intense, my thoughts Strong and perturb'd, not doubting at that time, Creed which ten shameful years have not annull'd, But that the virtue of one paramount mind Would have abash'd those impious crests, have quell'd Outrage and bloody power, and in despite Of what the People were through ignorance And immaturity, and, in the teeth Of desperate opposition from without, Have clear'd a passage for just government, And left a solid birthright to the State, Redeem'd according to example given By ancient Lawgivers. In this frame of mind, Reluctantly to England I return'd, Compell'd by nothing less than absolute want Of funds for my support, else, well assured That I both was and must be of small worth, No better than an alien in the Land, I doubtless should have made a common cause With some who perish'd, haply perish'd, too, A poor mistaken and bewilder'd offering, Should to the breast of Nature have gone back With all my resolutions, all my hopes, A Poet only to myself, to Men Useless, and even, beloved Friend! a soul To thee unknown. When to my native Land (After a whole year's absence) I return'd I found the air yet busy with the stir Of a contention which had been rais'd up Against the Traffickers in Negro blood, An effort, which though baffled, nevertheless Had call'd back old forgotten principles Dismiss'd from service, had diffus'd some truths And more of virtuous feeling through the heart Of the English People. And no few of those So numerous (little less in verity Than a whole Nation crying with one voice) Who had been cross'd in this their just intent And righteous hope, thereby were well prepared To let that journey sleep awhile, and join Whatever other Caravan appear'd To travel forward towards Liberty With more success. For me that strife had ne'er Fasten'd on my affections, nor did now Its unsuccessful issue much excite My sorrow, having laid this faith to heart, That, if France prosper'd, good Men would not long Pay fruitless worship to humanity, And this most rotten branch of human shame, Object, as seem'd, of a superfluous pains Would fall together with its parent tree. Such was my then belief, that there was one, And only one solicitude for all; And now the strength of Britain was put forth In league with the confederated Host, Not in my single self alone I found, But in the minds of all ingenuous Youth, Change and subversion from this hour. No shock Given to my moral nature had I known Down to that very moment; neither lapse Nor turn of sentiment that might be nam'd A revolution, save at this one time, All else was progress on the self-same path On which with a diversity of pace I had been travelling; this a stride at once Into another region. True it is, 'Twas not conceal'd with what ungracious eyes Our native Rulers from the very first Had look'd upon regenerated France Nor had I doubted that this day would come. But in such contemplation I had thought Of general interests only, beyond this Had [never] once foretasted the event. Now had I other business for I felt The ravage of this most unnatural strife In my own heart; there lay it like a weight At enmity with all the tenderest springs Of my enjoyments. I, who with the breeze Had play'd, a green leaf on the blessed tree Of my beloved country; nor had wish'd For happier fortune than to wither there, Now from my pleasant station was cut off, And toss'd about in whirlwinds. I rejoiced, Yea, afterwards, truth most painful to record! Exulted in the triumph of my soul When Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown, Left without glory on the Field, or driven, Brave hearts, to shameful flight. It was a grief, Grief call it not, 'twas anything but that, A conflict of sensations without name, Of which he only who may love the sight Of a Village Steeple as I do can judge When in the Congregation, bending all To their great Father, prayers were offer'd up, Or praises for our Country's Victories, And 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance, I only, like an uninvited Guest Whom no one own'd sate silent, shall I add, Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come? Oh! much have they to account for, who could tear By violence at one decisive rent From the best Youth in England, their dear pride, Their joy, in England; this, too, at a time In which worst losses easily might wear The best of names, when patriotic love Did of itself in modesty give way Like the Precursor when the Deity Is come, whose Harbinger he is, a time In which apostacy from ancient faith Seem'd but conversion to a higher creed, Withal a season dangerous and wild, A time in which Experience would have pluck'd Flowers out of any hedge to make thereof A Chaplet, in contempt of his grey locks. Ere yet the Fleet of Britain had gone forth On this unworthy service, whereunto The unhappy counsel of a few weak Men Had doom'd it, I beheld the Vessels lie, A brood of gallant Creatures, on the Deep I saw them in their rest, a sojourner Through a whole month of calm and glassy days, In that delightful Island which protects Their place of convocation; there I heard Each evening, walking by the still sea-shore, A monitory sound that never fail'd, The sunset cannon. While the Orb went down In the tranquillity of Nature, came That voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me Without a spirit overcast, a deep Imagination, thought of woes to come, And sorrow for mankind, and pain of heart. In France, the Men who for their desperate ends Had pluck'd up mercy by the roots were glad Of this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before In devilish pleas were ten times stronger now, And thus beset with Foes on every side The goaded Land waxed mad; the crimes of few Spread into madness of the many, blasts From hell came sanctified like airs from heaven; The sternness of the Just, the faith of those Who doubted not that Providence had times Of anger and of vengeance,—theirs who throned The human Understanding paramount And made of that their God, the hopes of those Who were content to barter short-lived pangs For a paradise of ages, the blind rage Of insolent tempers, the light vanity Of intermeddlers, steady purposes Of the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet, And all the accidents of life were press'd Into one service, busy with one work; The Senate was heart-stricken, not a voice Uplifted, none to oppose or mitigate; Domestic carnage now filled all the year With Feast-days; the old Man from the chimney-nook, The Maiden from the bosom of her Love, The Mother from the Cradle of her Babe, The Warrior from the Field, all perish'd, all, Friends, enemies, of all parties, ages, ranks, Head after head, and never heads enough For those that bade them fall: they found their joy, They made it, ever thirsty as a Child, If light desires of innocent little Ones May with such heinous appetites be match'd, Having a toy, a wind-mill, though the air Do of itself blow fresh, and make the vane Spin in his eyesight, he is not content But with the plaything at arm's length he sets His front against the blast, and runs amain, To make it whirl the faster. In the depth Of those enormities, even thinking minds Forgot at seasons whence they had their being, Forgot that such a sound was ever heard As Liberty upon earth: yet all beneath Her innocent authority was wrought, Nor could have been, without her blessed name. The illustrious Wife of Roland, in the hour Of her composure, felt that agony And gave it vent in her last words. O Friend! It was a lamentable time for man Whether a hope had e'er been his or not, A woeful time for them whose hopes did still Outlast the shock; most woeful for those few, They had the deepest feeling of the grief, Who still were flattered, and had trust in man. Meanwhile, the Invaders fared as they deserv'd; The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms And throttled with an infant Godhead's might The snakes about her cradle; that was well And as it should be, yet no cure for those Whose souls were sick with pain of what would be Hereafter brought in charge against mankind; Most melancholy at that time, O Friend! Were my day-thoughts, my dreams were miserable; Through months, through years, long after the last beat Of those atrocities (I speak bare truth, As if to thee alone in private talk) I scarcely had one night of quiet sleep Such ghastly visions had I of despair And tyranny, and implements of death, And long orations which in dreams I pleaded Before unjust Tribunals, with a voice Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense, Of treachery and desertion in the place The holiest that I knew of, my own soul. When I began at first, in early youth To yield myself to Nature, when that strong And holy passion overcame me first, Neither the day nor night, evening or morn Were free from the oppression; but, Great God! Who send'st thyself into this breathing world Through Nature and through every kind of life, And mak'st man what he is, Creature divine, In single or in social eminence Above all these rais'd infinite ascents When reason, which enables him to be, Is not sequester'd, what a change is here! How different ritual for this after worship What countenance to promote this second love That first was service but to things which lie At rest, within the bosom of thy will: Therefore to serve was high beatitude; The tumult was a gladness, and the fear Ennobling, venerable; sleep secure, And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams. But as the ancient Prophets were enflam'd Nor wanted consolations of their own And majesty of mind, when they denounced On Towns and Cities, wallowing in the abyss Of their offences, punishment to come; Or saw like other men with bodily eyes Before them in some desolated place The consummation of the wrath of Heaven, So did some portions of that spirit fall On me, to uphold me through those evil times, And in their rage and dog-day heat I found Something to glory in, as just and fit, And in the order of sublimest laws; And even if that were not, amid the awe Of unintelligible chastisement, I felt a kind of sympathy with power, Motions rais'd up within me, nevertheless, Which had relationship to highest things. Wild blasts of music thus did find their way Into the midst of turbulent events, So that worst tempests might be listen'd to: Then was the truth received into my heart, That under heaviest sorrow earth can bring, Griefs bitterest of ourselves or of our kind, If from the affliction somewhere do not grow Honour which could not else have been, a faith, An elevation, and a sanctity, If new strength be not given, or old restored The blame is ours not Nature's. When a taunt Was taken up by Scoffers in their pride, Saying, ‘behold the harvest which we reap From popular Government and Equality,’ I saw that it was neither these, nor aught Of wild belief engrafted on their names By false philosophy, that caus'd the woe, But that it was a reservoir of guilt And ignorance, fill'd up from age to age, That could no longer hold its loathsome charge, But burst and spread in deluge through the Land. And as the desart hath green spots, the sea Small islands in the midst of stormy waves, So that disastrous period did not want Such sprinklings of all human excellence, As were a joy to hear of. Yet (nor less For those bright spots, those fair examples given Of fortitude, and energy, and love, And human nature faithful to itself Under worst trials) was I impell'd to think Of the glad time when first I traversed France, A youthful pilgrim, above all remember'd That day when through an Arch that spann'd the street, A rainbow made of garish ornaments, Triumphal pomp for Liberty confirm'd, We walk'd, a pair of weary Travellers, Along the Town of Arras, place from which Issued that Robespierre, who afterwards Wielded the sceptre of the atheist crew. When the calamity spread far and wide, And this same City, which had then appear'd To outrun the rest in exultation, groan'd Under the vengeance of her cruel Son, As Lear reproach'd the winds, I could almost Have quarrel'd with that blameless spectacle For being yet an image in my mind To mock me under such a strange reverse. O Friend! few happier moments have been mine Through my whole life than that when first I heard That this foul Tribe of Moloch was o'erthrown, And their chief Regent levell'd with the dust. The day was one which haply may deserve A separate chronicle. Having gone abroad From a small Village where I tarried then, To the same far-secluded privacy I was returning. Over the smooth Sands Of Leven's ample Æstuary lay My journey, and beneath a genial sun; With distant prospect among gleams of sky And clouds, and intermingled mountain tops, In one inseparable glory clad, Creatures of one ethereal substance, met In Consistory, like a diadem Or crown of burning Seraphs, as they sit In the Empyrean. Underneath this show Lay, as I knew, the nest of pastoral vales Among whose happy fields I had grown up From childhood. On the fulgent spectacle Which neither changed, nor stirr'd, nor pass'd away, I gazed, and with a fancy more alive On this account, that I had chanced to find That morning, ranging thro' the churchyard graves Of Cartmell's rural Town, the place in which An honor'd Teacher of my youth was laid. While we were Schoolboys he had died among us, And was borne hither, as I knew, to rest With his own Family. A plain Stone, inscribed With name, date, office, pointed out the spot, To which a slip of verses was subjoin'd, (By his desire, as afterwards I learn'd) A fragment from the Elegy of Gray. A week, or little less, before his death He had said to me, ‘my head will soon lie low;’ And when I saw the turf that cover'd him, After the lapse of full eight years, those words, With sound of voice, and countenance of the Man, Came back upon me; so that some few tears Fell from me in my own despite. And now, Thus travelling smoothly o'er the level Sands, I thought with pleasure of the Verses, graven Upon his Tombstone, saying to myself He loved the Poets, and if now alive, Would have loved me, as one not destitute Of promise, nor belying the kind hope That he had form'd, when I at his command, Began to spin, at first, my toilsome Songs. Without me and within, as I advanced, All that I saw, or felt, or communed with Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small And rocky Island near, a fragment stood (Itself like a sea rock) of what had been A Romish Chapel, where in ancient times Masses were said at the hour which suited those Who crossed the Sands with ebb of morning tide. Not far from this still Ruin all the Plain Was spotted with a variegated crowd Of Coaches, Wains, and Travellers, horse and foot, Wading, beneath the conduct of their Guide In loose procession through the shallow Stream Of inland water; the great Sea meanwhile Was at safe distance, far retired. I paused, Unwilling to proceed, the scene appear'd So gay and chearful, when a Traveller Chancing to pass, I carelessly inquired If any news were stirring; he replied In the familiar language of the day That, Robespierre was dead. Nor was a doubt, On further question, left within my mind But that the tidings were substantial truth; That he and his supporters all were fallen. Great was my glee of spirit, great my joy In vengeance, and eternal justice, thus Made manifest. ‘Come now ye golden times,’ Said I, forth-breathing on those open Sands A Hymn of triumph, ‘as the morning comes Out of the bosom of the night, come Ye: Thus far our trust is verified; behold! They who with clumsy desperation brought Rivers of Blood, and preached that nothing else Could cleanse the Augean Stable, by the might Of their own helper have been swept away; Their madness is declared and visible, Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and Earth March firmly towards righteousness and peace.’ Then schemes I framed more calmly, when and how The madding Factions might be tranquillised, And, though through hardships manifold and long, The mighty renovation would proceed; Thus, interrupted by uneasy bursts Of exultation, I pursued my way Along that very Shore which I had skimm'd In former times, when, spurring from the Vale Of Nightshade, and St. Mary's mouldering Fane, And the Stone Abbot, after circuit made In wantonness of heart, a joyous Crew Of School-boys, hastening to their distant home, Along the margin of the moonlight Sea, We beat with thundering hoofs the level Sand. From this time forth, in France, as is well known, Authority put on a milder face, Yet everything was wanting that might give Courage to them who look'd for good by light Of rational experience, good I mean At hand, and in the spirit of past aims. The same belief I, nevertheless, retain'd; The language of the Senate and the acts And public measures of the Government, Though both of heartless omen, had not power To daunt me; in the People was my trust And in the virtues which mine eyes had seen, And to the ultimate repose of things I look'd with unabated confidence; I knew that wound external could not take Life from the young Republic, that new foes Would only follow in the path of shame Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end Great, universal, irresistible. This faith, which was an object in my mind Of passionate intuition, had effect Not small in dazzling me; for thus, thro' zeal, Such victory I confounded in my thoughts With one far higher and more difficult, Triumphs of unambitious peace at home And noiseless fortitude. Beholding still Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought That what was in degree the same, was likewise The same in quality, that, as the worse Of the two spirits then at strife remain'd Untired, the better surely would preserve The heart that first had rouzed him, never dreamt That transmigration could be undergone A fall of being suffer'd, and of hope By creature that appear'd to have received Entire conviction what a great ascent Had been accomplish'd, what high faculties It had been call'd to. Youth maintains, I knew, In all conditions of society, Communion more direct and intimate With Nature, and the inner strength she has, And hence, oft-times, no less, with Reason too, Than Age or Manhood, even. To Nature then, Power had reverted: habit, custom, law, Had left an interregnum's open space For her to stir about in, uncontrol'd. The warmest judgments and the most untaught Found in events which every day brought forth Enough to sanction them, and far, far more To shake the authority of canons drawn From ordinary practice. I could see How Babel-like the employment was of those Who, by the recent deluge stupefied, With their whole souls went culling from the day Its petty promises to build a tower For their own safety; laughed at gravest heads, Who, watching in their hate of France for signs Of her disasters, if the stream of rumour Brought with it one green branch, conceited thence That not a single tree was left alive In all her forests. How could I believe That wisdom could in any shape come near Men clinging to delusions so insane? And thus, experience proving that no few Of my opinions had been just, I took Like credit to myself where less was due, And thought that other notions were as sound, Yea, could not but be right, because I saw That foolish men opposed them. To a strain More animated I might here give way, And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme, What in those days through Britain was perform'd To turn all judgments out of their right course; But this is passion over-near ourselves, Reality too close and too intense, And mingled up with something, in my mind, Of scorn and condemnation personal, That would profane the sanctity of verse. Our Shepherds (this say merely) at that time Thirsted to make the guardian Crook of Law A tool of Murder; they who ruled the State, Though with such awful proof before their eyes That he who would sow death, reaps death, or worse, And can reap nothing better, child-like long'd To imitate, not wise enough to avoid, Giants in their impiety alone, But, in their weapons and their warfare base As vermin working out of reach, they leagu'd Their strength perfidiously, to undermine Justice, and make an end of Liberty. But from these bitter truths I must return To my own History. It hath been told That I was led to take an eager part In arguments of civil polity Abruptly, and indeed before my time: I had approach'd, like other Youth, the Shield Of human nature from the golden side And would have fought, even to the death, to attest The quality of the metal which I saw. What there is best in individual Man, Of wise in passion, and sublime in power, What there is strong and pure in household love, Benevolent in small societies, And great in large ones also, when call'd forth By great occasions, these were things of which I something knew, yet even these themselves, Felt deeply, were not thoroughly understood By Reason; nay, far from it, they were yet, As cause was given me afterwards to learn, Not proof against the injuries of the day, Lodged only at the Sanctuary's door, Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared, And with such general insight into evil, And of the bounds which sever it from good, As books and common intercourse with life Must needs have given; to the noviciate mind, When the world travels in a beaten road, Guide faithful as is needed, I began To think with fervour upon management Of Nations, what it is and ought to be, And how their worth depended on their Laws And on the Constitution of the State. O pleasant exercise of hope and joy! For great were the auxiliars which then stood Upon our side, we who were strong in love; Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very heaven; O times, In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways Of custom, law, and statute took at once The attraction of a Country in Romance; When Reason seem'd the most to assert her rights When most intent on making of herself A prime Enchanter to assist the work, Which then was going forwards in her name. Not favour'd spots alone, but the whole earth The beauty wore of promise, that which sets, To take an image which was felt, no doubt, Among the bowers of paradise itself, The budding rose above the rose full blown. What temper at the prospect did not wake To happiness unthought of? The inert Were rouz'd, and lively natures rapt away: They who had fed their childhood upon dreams, The Play-fellows of Fancy, who had made All powers of swiftness, subtlety, and strength Their ministers, used to stir in lordly wise Among the grandest objects of the sense, And deal with whatsoever they found there As if they had within some lurking right To wield it; they too, who, of gentle mood Had watch'd all gentle motions, and to these Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild, And in the region of their peaceful selves, Did now find helpers to their hearts' desire, And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish, Were call'd upon to exercise their skill, Not in Utopia, subterraneous Fields, Or some secreted Island, Heaven knows where, But in the very world which is the world Of all of us, the place in which, in the end, We find our happiness, or not at all. Why should I not confess that earth was then To me what an inheritance new-fallen Seems, when the first time visited, to one Who thither comes to find in it his home? He walks about and looks upon the place With cordial transport, moulds it, and remoulds, And is half pleased with things that are amiss, 'Twill be such joy to see them disappear. An active partisan, I thus convoked From every object pleasant circumstance To suit my ends; I moved among mankind With genial feelings still predominant; When erring, erring on the better part, And in the kinder spirit; placable, Indulgent oft-times to the worst desires As on one side not uniform'd that men See as it hath been taught them, and that time Gives rights to error; on the other hand That throwing off oppression must be work As well of license as of liberty; And above all, for this was more than all, Not caring if the wind did now and then Blow keen upon an eminence that gave Prospect so large into futurity; In brief, a child of nature, as at first, Diffusing only those affections wider That from the cradle had grown up with me, And losing, in no other way than light Is lost in light, the weak in the more strong. In the main outline, such, it might be said, Was my condition, till with open war Britain opposed the Liberties of France; This threw me first out of the pale of love; Sour'd and corrupted upwards to the source My sentiments, was not, as hitherto, A swallowing up of lesser things in great; But change of them into their opposites, And thus a way was opened for mistakes And false conclusions of the intellect, As gross in their degree and in their kind Far, far more dangerous. What had been a pride Was now a shame; my likings and my loves Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry, And hence a blow which, in maturer age, Would but have touch'd the judgment struck more deep Into sensations near the heart: meantime, As from the first, wild theories were afloat, Unto the subtleties of which, at least, I had but lent a careless ear, assured Of this, that time would soon set all things right, Prove that the multitude had been oppressed, And would be so no more. But when events Brought less encouragement, and unto these The immediate proof of principles no more Could be entrusted, while the events themselves, Worn out in greatness, and in novelty, Less occupied the mind, and sentiments Could through my understanding's natural growth No longer justify themselves through faith Of inward consciousness, and hope that laid Its hand upon its object, evidence Safer, of universal application, such As could not be impeach'd, was sought elsewhere. And now, become oppressors in their turn, Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence For one of conquest, losing sight of all Which they had struggled for; and mounted up, Openly, in the view of earth and heaven, The scale of Liberty. I read her doom, Vex'd inly somewhat, it is true, and sore; But not dismay'd, nor taking to the shame Of a false Prophet; but, rouz'd up I stuck More firmly to old tenets, and to prove Their temper, strained them more, and thus in heat Of contest did opinions every day Grow into consequence, till round my mind They clung, as if they were the life of it. This was the time when all things tending fast To depravation, the Philosophy That promised to abstract the hopes of man Out of his feelings, to be fix'd thenceforth For ever in a purer element Found ready welcome. Tempting region that For Zeal to enter and refresh herself, Where passions had the privilege to work, And never hear the sound of their own names; But, speaking more in charity, the dream Was flattering to the young ingenuous mind Pleas'd with extremes, and not the least with that Which makes the human Reason's naked self The object of its fervour. What delight! How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule, To look through all the frailties of the world, And, with a resolute mastery shaking off The accidents of nature, time, and place, That make up the weak being of the past, Build social freedom on its only basis, The freedom of the individual mind, Which, to the blind restraints of general laws Superior, magisterially adopts One guide, the light of circumstances, flash'd Upon an independent intellect. For howsoe'er unsettled, never once Had I thought ill of human kind, or been Indifferent to its welfare, but, enflam'd With thirst of a secure intelligence And sick of other passion, I pursued A higher nature, wish'd that Man should start Out of the worm-like state in which he is, And spread abroad the wings of Liberty, Lord of himself, in undisturb'd delight— A noble aspiration, yet I feel The aspiration, but with other thoughts And happier; for I was perplex'd and sought To accomplish the transition by such means As did not lie in nature, sacrificed The exactness of a comprehensive mind To scrupulous and microscopic views That furnish'd out materials for a work Of false imagination, placed beyond The limits of experience and of truth. Enough, no doubt, the advocates themselves Of ancient institutions had perform'd To bring disgrace upon their very names, Disgrace of which custom and written law And sundry moral sentiments as props And emanations of those institutes Too justly bore a part. A veil had been Uplifted; why deceive ourselves? 'Twas so, 'Twas even so, and sorrow for the Man Who either had not eyes wherewith to see, Or seeing hath forgotten. Let this pass, Suffice it that a shock had then been given To old opinions; and the minds of all men Had felt it; that my mind was both let loose, Let loose and goaded. After what hath been Already said of patriotic love, And hinted at in other sentiments We need not linger long upon this theme. This only may be said, that from the first Having two natures in me, joy the one The other melancholy, and withal A happy man, and therefore bold to look On painful things, slow, somewhat, too, and stern In temperament, I took the knife in hand And stopping not at parts less sensitive, Endeavoured with my best of skill to probe The living body of society Even to the heart; I push'd without remorse My speculations forward; yea, set foot On Nature's holiest places. Time may come When some dramatic Story may afford Shapes livelier to convey to thee, my Friend, What then I learn'd, or think I learn'd, of truth, And the errors into which I was betray'd By present objects, and by reasonings false From the beginning, inasmuch as drawn Out of a heart which had been turn'd aside From Nature by external accidents, And which was thus confounded more and more, Misguiding and misguided. Thus I fared, Dragging all passions, notions, shapes of faith, Like culprits to the bar, suspiciously Calling the mind to establish in plain day Her titles and her honours, now believing, Now disbelieving, endlessly perplex'd With impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground Of moral obligation, what the rule And what the sanction, till, demanding proof, And seeking it in everything, I lost All feeling of conviction, and, in fine, Sick, wearied out with contrarieties, Yielded up moral questions in despair, And for my future studies, as the sole Employment of the enquiring faculty, Turn'd towards mathematics, and their clear And solid evidence—Ah! then it was That Thou, most precious Friend! about this time First known to me, didst lend a living help To regulate my Soul, and then it was That the belovèd Woman in whose sight Those days were pass'd, now speaking in a voice Of sudden admonition, like a brook That did but cross a lonely road, and now Seen, heard and felt, and caught at every turn, Companion never lost through many a league, Maintained for me a saving intercourse With my true self; for, though impair'd and chang'd Much, as it seemed, I was no further chang'd Than as a clouded, not a waning moon: She, in the midst of all, preserv'd me still A Poet, made me seek beneath that name My office upon earth, and nowhere else, And lastly, Nature's Self, by human love Assisted, through the weary labyrinth Conducted me again to open day, Revived the feelings of my earlier life, Gave me that strength and knowledge full of peace, Enlarged, and never more to be disturb'd, Which through the steps of our degeneracy, All degradation of this age, hath still Upheld me, and upholds me at this day In the catastrophe (for so they dream, And nothing less), when finally, to close And rivet up the gains of France, a Pope Is summon'd in to crown an Emperor; This last opprobrium, when we see the dog Returning to his vomit, when the sun That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved In exultation among living clouds Hath put his function and his glory off, And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine, Sets like an opera phantom. Thus, O Friend! Through times of honour, and through times of shame, Have I descended, tracing faithfully The workings of a youthful mind, beneath The breath of great events, its hopes no less Than universal, and its boundless love; A Story destined for thy ear, who now, Among the basest and the lowest fallen Of all the race of men, dost make abode Where Etna looketh down on Syracuse, The city of Timoleon! Living God! How are the Mighty prostrated! they first, They first of all that breathe should have awaked When the great voice was heard from out the tombs Of ancient Heroes. If for France I have griev'd Who, in the judgment of no few, hath been A trifler only, in her proudest day, Have been distress'd to think of what she once Promised, now is, a far more sober cause Thine eyes must see of sorrow, in a Land Strew'd with the wreck of loftiest years, a Land Glorious indeed, substantially renown'd Of simple virtue once, and manly praise, Now without one memorial hope, not even A hope to be deferr'd; for that would serve To chear the heart in such entire decay. But indignation works where hope is not, And thou, O Friend! wilt be refresh'd. There is One great Society alone on earth, The noble Living and the noble Dead: Thy consolation shall be there, and Time And Nature shall before thee spread in store Imperishable thoughts, the Place itself Be conscious of thy presence, and the dull Sirocco air of its degeneracy Turn as thou mov'st into a healthful breeze To cherish and invigorate thy frame. Thine be those motions strong and sanative, A ladder for thy Spirit to reascend To health and joy and pure contentedness; To me the grief confined that Thou art gone From this last spot of earth where Freedom now Stands single in her only sanctuary, A lonely wanderer, art gone, by pain Compell'd and sickness, at this latter day, This heavy time of change for all mankind; I feel for Thee, must utter what I feel: The sympathies, erewhile, in part discharg'd, Gather afresh, and will have vent again: My own delights do scarcely seem to me My own delights; the lordly Alps themselves, Those rosy Peaks, from which the Morning looks Abroad on many Nations, are not now Since thy migration and departure, Friend, The gladsome image in my memory Which they were used to be; to kindred scenes, On errand, at a time how different! Thou tak'st thy way, carrying a heart more ripe For all divine enjoyment, with the soul Which Nature gives to Poets, now by thought Matur'd, and in the summer of its strength. Oh! wrap him in your Shades, ye Giant Woods, On Etna's side, and thou, O flowery Vale Of Enna! is there not some nook of thine, From the first playtime of the infant earth Kept sacred to restorative delight? Child of the mountains, among Shepherds rear'd, Even from my earliest school-day time, I lov'd To dream of Sicily; and now a strong And vital promise wafted from that Land Comes o'er my heart; there's not a single name Of note belonging to that honor'd isle, Philosopher or Bard, Empedocles, Or Archimedes, deep and tranquil Soul! That is not like a comfort to my grief: And, O Theocritus, so far have some Prevail'd among the Powers of heaven and earth, By force of graces which were their's, that they Have had, as thou reportest, miracles Wrought for them in old time: yea, not unmov'd, When thinking on my own beloved Friend, I hear thee tell how bees with honey fed Divine Comates, by his tyrant lord Within a chest imprison'd impiously How with their honey from the fields they came And fed him there, alive, from month to month, Because the Goatherd, blessed Man! had lips Wet with the Muses' Nectar. Thus I soothe The pensive moments by this calm fire side, And find a thousand fancied images That chear the thoughts of those I love, and mine. Our prayers have been accepted; Thou wilt stand Not as an Exile but a Visitant On Etna's top; by pastoral Arethuse Or, if that fountain be in truth no more, Then near some other Spring, which by the name Thou gratulatest, willingly deceived, Shalt linger as a gladsome Votary, And not a Captive, pining for his home. BOOK ELEVENTH IMAGINATION, HOW IMPAIRED AND RESTORED Long time hath Man's unhappiness and guilt Detain'd us; with what dismal sights beset For the outward view, and inwardly oppress'd With sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts, Confusion of opinion, zeal decay'd, And lastly, utter loss of hope itself, And things to hope for. Not with these began Our Song, and not with these our Song must end: Ye motions of delight, that through the fields Stir gently, breezes and soft airs that breathe The breath of Paradise, and find your way To the recesses of the soul! Ye Brooks Muttering along the stones, a busy noise By day, a quiet one in silent night, And you, ye Groves, whose ministry it is To interpose the covert of your shades, Even as a sleep, betwixt the heart of man And the uneasy world, 'twixt man himself, Not seldom, and his own unquiet heart, Oh! that I had a music and a voice, Harmonious as your own, that I might tell What ye have done for me. The morning shines, Nor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring returns, I saw the Spring return, when I was dead To deeper hope, yet had I joy for her, And welcomed her benevolence, rejoiced In common with the Children of her Love, Plants, insects, beasts in field, and birds in bower. So neither were complacency nor peace Nor tender yearnings wanting for my good Through those distracted times; in Nature still Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her, Which, when the spirit of evil was at height Maintain'd for me a secret happiness; Her I resorted to, and lov'd so much I seem'd to love as much as heretofore; And yet this passion, fervent as it was, Had suffer'd change; how could there fail to be Some change, if merely hence, that years of life Were going on, and with them loss or gain Inevitable, sure alternative. This History, my Friend, hath chiefly told Of intellectual power, from stage to stage Advancing, hand in hand with love and joy, And of imagination teaching truth Until that natural graciousness of mind Gave way to over-pressure from the times And their disastrous issues. What avail'd, When Spells forbade the Voyager to land, The fragrance which did ever and anon Give notice of the Shore, from arbours breathed Of blessed sentiment and fearless love? What did such sweet remembrances avail, Perfidious then, as seem'd, what serv'd they then? My business was upon the barren sea, My errand was to sail to other coasts. Shall I avow that I had hope to see, I mean that future times would surely see The man to come parted as by a gulph, From him who had been, that I could no more Trust the elevation which had made me one With the great Family that here and there Is scatter'd through the abyss of ages past, Sage, Patriot, Lover, Hero; for it seem'd That their best virtues were not free from taint Of something false and weak, which could not stand The open eye of Reason. Then I said, Go to the Poets they will speak to thee More perfectly of purer creatures, yet If Reason be nobility in man, Can aught be more ignoble than the man Whom they describe, would fasten if they may Upon our love by sympathies of truth. Thus strangely did I war against myself; A Bigot to a new Idolatry Did like a Monk who hath forsworn the world Zealously labour to cut off my heart From all the sources of her former strength; And, as by simple waving of a wand The wizard instantaneously dissolves Palace or grove, even so did I unsoul As readily by syllogistic words Some charm of Logic, ever within reach, Those mysteries of passion which have made, And shall continue evermore to make, (In spite of all that Reason hath perform'd And shall perform to exalt and to refine) One brotherhood of all the human race Through all the habitations of past years And those to come, and hence an emptiness Fell on the Historian's Page, and even on that Of Poets, pregnant with more absolute truth. The works of both wither'd in my esteem Their sentence was, I thought, pronounc'd; their rights Seem'd mortal, and their empire pass'd away. What then remained in such eclipse? what light To guide or chear? The laws of things which lie Beyond the reach of human will or power; The life of nature, by the God of love Inspired, celestial presence ever pure; These left, the Soul of Youth must needs be rich, Whatever else be lost, and these were mine, Not a deaf echo, merely, of the thought Bewilder'd recollections, solitary, But living sounds. Yet in despite of this, This feeling, which howe'er impair'd or damp'd, Yet having been once born can never die. 'Tis true that Earth with all her appanage Of elements and organs, storm and sunshine, With its pure forms and colours, pomp of clouds Rivers and mountains, objects among which It might be thought that no dislike or blame, No sense of weakness or infirmity Or aught amiss could possibly have come, Yea, even the visible universe was scann'd With something of a kindred spirit, fell Beneath the domination of a taste Less elevated, which did in my mind With its more noble influence interfere, Its animation and its deeper sway. There comes (if need be now to speak of this After such long detail of our mistakes) There comes a time when Reason, not the grand And simple Reason, but that humbler power Which carries on its no inglorious work By logic and minute analysis Is of all Idols that which pleases most The growing mind. A Trifler would he be Who on the obvious benefits should dwell That rise out of this process; but to speak Of all the narrow estimates of things Which hence originate were a worthy theme For philosophic Verse; suffice it here To hint that danger cannot but attend Upon a Function rather proud to be The enemy of falsehood, than the friend Of truth, to sit in judgment than to feel. Oh! soul of Nature, excellent and fair, That didst rejoice with me, with whom I too Rejoiced, through early youth before the winds And powerful waters, and in lights and shades That march'd and countermarch'd about the hills In glorious apparition, now all eye And now all ear; but ever with the heart Employ'd, and the majestic intellect, Oh! Soul of Nature! that dost overflow With passion and with life, what feeble men Walk on this earth! how feeble have I been When thou wert in thy strength! Nor this through stroke Of human suffering, such as justifies Remissness and inaptitude of mind, But through presumption, even in pleasure pleas'd Unworthily, disliking here, and there, Liking, by rules of mimic art transferr'd To things above all art. But more, for this, Although a strong infection of the age, Was never much my habit, giving way To a comparison of scene with scene, Bent overmuch on superficial things, Pampering myself with meagre novelties Of colour and proportion, to the moods Of time and season, to the moral power The affections, and the spirit of the place, Less sensible. Nor only did the love Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt My deeper feelings, but another cause More subtle and less easily explain'd That almost seems inherent in the Creature, Sensuous and intellectual as he is, A twofold Frame of body and of mind; The state to which I now allude was one In which the eye was master of the heart, When that which is in every stage of life The most despotic of our senses gain'd Such strength in me as often held my mind In absolute dominion. Gladly here, Entering upon abstruser argument, Would I endeavour to unfold the means Which Nature studiously employs to thwart This tyranny, summons all the senses each To counteract the other and themselves, And makes them all, and the objects with which all Are conversant, subservient in their turn To the great ends of Liberty and Power. But this is matter for another Song; Here only let me add that my delights, Such as they were, were sought insatiably, Though 'twas a transport of the outward sense, Not of the mind, vivid but not profound: Yet was I often greedy in the chace, And roam'd from hill to hill, from rock to rock, Still craving combinations of new forms, New pleasure, wider empire for the sight, Proud of its own endowments, and rejoiced To lay the inner faculties asleep. Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife And various trials of our complex being, As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense Seems hard to shun; and yet I knew a Maid, Who, young as I was then, conversed with things In higher style, from Appetites like these She, gentle Visitant, as well she might Was wholly free, far less did critic rules Or barren intermeddling subtleties Perplex her mind; but, wise as Women are When genial circumstance hath favor'd them, She welcom'd what was given, and craved no more. Whatever scene was present to her eyes, That was the best, to that she was attuned Through her humility and lowliness, And through a perfect happiness of soul Whose variegated feelings were in this Sisters, that they were each some new delight: For she was Nature's inmate. Her the birds And every flower she met with, could they but Have known her, would have lov'd. Methought such charm Of sweetness did her presence breathe around That all the trees, and all the silent hills And every thing she look'd on, should have had An intimation how she bore herself Towards them and to all creatures. God delights In such a being; for her common thoughts Are piety, her life is blessedness. Even like this Maid before I was call'd forth From the retirement of my native hills I lov'd whate'er I saw; nor lightly lov'd, But fervently, did never dream of aught More grand, more fair, more exquisitely fram'd Than those few nooks to which my happy feet Were limited. I had not at that time Liv'd long enough, nor in the least survived The first diviner influence of this world, As it appears to unaccustom'd eyes; I worshipp'd then among the depth of things As my soul bade me; could I then take part In aught but admiration, or be pleased With any thing but humbleness and love; I felt, and nothing else; I did not judge, I never thought of judging, with the gift Of all this glory fill'd and satisfi'd. And afterwards, when through the gorgeous Alps Roaming, I carried with me the same heart: In truth, this degradation, howsoe'er Induced, effect in whatsoe'er degree Of custom, that prepares such wantonness As makes the greatest things give way to least, Or any other cause which hath been named; Or lastly, aggravated by the times, Which with their passionate sounds might often make The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes Inaudible, was transient; I had felt Too forcibly, too early in my life, Visitings of imaginative power For this to last: I shook the habit off Entirely and for ever, and again In Nature's presence stood, as I stand now, A sensitive, and a creative soul. There are in our existence spots of time, Which with distinct pre-eminence retain A vivifying Virtue, whence, depress'd By false opinion and contentious thought, Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight, In trivial occupations, and the round Of ordinary intercourse, our minds Are nourished and invisibly repair'd, A virtue by which pleasure is enhanced That penetrates, enables us to mount When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen. This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks Among those passages of life in which We have had deepest feeling that the mind Is lord and master, and that outward sense Is but the obedient servant of her will. Such moments worthy of all gratitude, Are scatter'd everywhere, taking their date From our first childhood: in our childhood even Perhaps are most conspicuous. Life with me, As far as memory can look back, is full Of this beneficent influence. At a time When scarcely (I was then not six years old) My hand could hold a bridle, with proud hopes I mounted, and we rode towards the hills: We were a pair of horsemen; honest James Was with me, my encourager and guide. We had not travell'd long, ere some mischance Disjoin'd me from my Comrade, and, through fear Dismounting, down the rough and stony Moor I led my Horse, and stumbling on, at length Came to a bottom, where in former times A Murderer had been hung in iron chains. The Gibbet-mast was moulder'd down, the bones And iron case were gone; but on the turf, Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought Some unknown hand had carved the Murderer's name. The monumental writing was engraven In times long past, and still, from year to year, By superstition of the neighbourhood, The grass is clear'd away; and to this hour The letters are all fresh and visible. Faltering, and ignorant where I was, at length I chanced to espy those characters inscribed On the green sod: forthwith I left the spot And, reascending the bare Common, saw A naked Pool that lay beneath the hills, The Beacon on the summit, and more near, A Girl who bore a Pitcher on her head And seem'd with difficult steps to force her way Against the blowing wind. It was, in truth, An ordinary sight; but I should need Colours and words that are unknown to man To paint the visionary dreariness Which, while I look'd all round for my lost guide, Did at that time invest the naked Pool, The Beacon on the lonely Eminence, The Woman, and her garments vex'd and toss'd By the strong wind. When, in a blessed season With those two dear Ones, to my heart so dear, When in the blessed time of early love, Long afterwards, I roam'd about In daily presence of this very scene, Upon the naked pool and dreary crags, And on the melancholy Beacon, fell The spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam; And think ye not with radiance more divine From these remembrances, and from the power They left behind? So feeling comes in aid Of feeling, and diversity of strength Attends us, if but once we have been strong. Oh! mystery of Man, from what a depth Proceed thy honours! I am lost, but see In simple childhood something of the base On which thy greatness stands, but this I feel, That from thyself it is that thou must give, Else never canst receive. The days gone by Come back upon me from the dawn almost Of life: the hiding-places of my power Seem open; I approach, and then they close; I see by glimpses now; when age comes on, May scarcely see at all, and I would give, While yet we may, as far as words can give, A substance and a life to what I feel: I would enshrine the spirit of the past For future restoration. Yet another Of these to me affecting incidents With which we will conclude. One Christmas-time, The day before the holidays began, Feverish and tired, and restless, I went forth Into the fields, impatient for the sight Of those two Horses which should bear us home; My Brothers and myself. There was a crag, An Eminence, which from the meeting-point Of two highways ascending, overlook'd At least a long half-mile of those two roads, By each of which the expected Steeds might come, The choice uncertain. Thither I repair'd Up to the highest summit; 'twas a day Stormy, and rough, and wild, and on the grass I sate, half-shelter'd by a naked wall; Upon my right hand was a single sheep, A whistling hawthorn on my left, and there, With those companions at my side, I watch'd, Straining my eyes intensely, as the mist Gave intermitting prospect of the wood And plain beneath. Ere I to School return'd That dreary time, ere I had been ten days A dweller in my Father's House, he died, And I and my two Brothers, Orphans then, Followed his Body to the Grave. The event With all the sorrow which it brought appear'd A chastisement; and when I call'd to mind That day so lately pass'd, when from the crag I look'd in such anxiety of hope, With trite reflections of morality, Yet in the deepest passion, I bow'd low To God, who thus corrected my desires; And afterwards, the wind and sleety rain And all the business of the elements, The single sheep, and the one blasted tree, And the bleak music of that old stone wall, The noise of wood and water, and the mist Which on the line of each of those two Roads Advanced in such indisputable shapes, All these were spectacles and sounds to which I often would repair and thence would drink, As at a fountain; and I do not doubt That in this later time, when storm and rain Beat on my roof at midnight, or by day When I am in the woods, unknown to me The workings of my spirit thence are brought. Thou wilt not languish here, O Friend, for whom I travel in these dim uncertain ways Thou wilt assist me as a pilgrim gone In quest of highest truth. Behold me then Once more in Nature's presence, thus restored Or otherwise, and strengthened once again (With memory left of what had been escaped) To habits of devoutest sympathy. BOOK TWELFTH SAME SUBJECT—Continued From nature doth emotion come, and moods Of calmness equally are nature's gift, This is her glory; these two attributes Are sister horns that constitute her strength; This twofold influence is the sun and shower Of all her bounties, both in origin And end alike benignant. Hence it is, That Genius which exists by interchange Of peace and excitation, finds in her His best and purest Friend, from her receives That energy by which he seeks the truth, Is rouz'd, aspires, grasps, struggles, wishes, craves, From her that happy stillness of the mind Which fits him to receive it, when unsought. Such benefit may souls of humblest frame Partake of, each in their degree; 'tis mine To speak, what I myself have known and felt Sweet task! for words find easy way, inspired By gratitude and confidence in truth. Long time in search of knowledge desperate, I was benighted heart and mind; but now On all sides day began to reappear, And it was proved indeed that not in vain I had been taught to reverence a Power That is the very quality and shape And image of right reason, that matures Her processes by steadfast laws, gives birth To no impatient or fallacious hopes, No heat of passion or excessive zeal, No vain conceits, provokes to no quick turns Of self-applauding intellect, but lifts The Being into magnanimity; Holds up before the mind, intoxicate With present objects and the busy dance Of things that pass away, a temperate shew Of objects that endure, and by this course Disposes her, when over-fondly set On leaving her incumbrances behind To seek in Man, and in the frame of life, Social and individual, what there is Desirable, affecting, good or fair Of kindred permanence, the gifts divine And universal, the pervading grace That hath been, is, and shall be. Above all Did Nature bring again that wiser mood More deeply re-established in my soul, Which, seeing little worthy or sublime In what we blazon with the pompous names Of power and action, early tutor'd me To look with feelings of fraternal love Upon those unassuming things, that hold A silent station in this beauteous world. Thus moderated, thus composed, I found Once more in Man an object of delight Of pure imagination, and of love; And, as the horizon of my mind enlarged, Again I took the intellectual eye For my instructor, studious more to see Great Truths, than touch and handle little ones. Knowledge was given accordingly; my trust Was firmer in the feelings which had stood The test of such a trial; clearer far My sense of what was excellent and right; The promise of the present time retired Into its true proportion; sanguine schemes, Ambitious virtues pleased me less, I sought For good in the familiar face of life And built thereon my hopes of good to come. With settling judgments now of what would last And what would disappear, prepared to find Ambition, folly, madness in the men Who thrust themselves upon this passive world As Rulers of the world, to see in these, Even when the public welfare is their aim, Plans without thought, or bottom'd on false thought And false philosophy: having brought to test Of solid life and true result the Books Of modern Statists, and thereby perceiv'd The utter hollowness of what we name The wealth of Nations, where alone that wealth Is lodged, and how encreased, and having gain'd A more judicious knowledge of what makes The dignity of individual Man, Of Man, no composition of the thought, Abstraction, shadow, image, but the man Of whom we read, the man whom we behold With our own eyes; I could not but inquire, Not with less interest than heretofore, But greater, though in spirit more subdued, Why is this glorious Creature to be found One only in ten thousand? What one is, Why may not many be? What bars are thrown By Nature in the way of such a hope? Our animal wants and the necessities Which they impose, are these the obstacles? If not, then others vanish into air. Such meditations bred an anxious wish To ascertain how much of real worth And genuine knowledge, and true power of mind Did at this day exist in those who liv'd By bodily labour, labour far exceeding Their due proportion, under all the weight Of that injustice which upon ourselves By composition of society Ourselves entail. To frame such estimate I chiefly look'd (what need to look beyond?) Among the natural abodes of men, Fields with their rural works, recall'd to mind My earliest notices, with these compared The observations of my later youth, Continued downwards to that very day. For time had never been in which the throes And mighty hopes of Nations, and the stir And tumult of the world to me could yield, How far soe'er transported and possess'd, Full measure of content; but still I craved An intermixture of distinct regards And truths of individual sympathy Nearer ourselves. Such often might be glean'd From that great City, else it must have been A heart-depressing wilderness indeed, Full soon to me a wearisome abode; But much was wanting; therefore did I turn To you, ye Pathways, and ye lonely Roads Sought you enrich'd with everything I prized, With human kindness and with Nature's joy. Oh! next to one dear state of bliss, vouchsafed Alas! to few in this untoward world, The bliss of walking daily in Life's prime Through field or forest with the Maid we love, While yet our hearts are young, while yet we breathe Nothing but happiness, living in some place, Deep Vale, or anywhere, the home of both, From which it would be misery to stir; Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth, In my esteem, next to such dear delight Was that of wandering on from day to day Where I could meditate in peace, and find The knowledge which I love, and teach the sound Of Poet's music to strange fields and groves, Converse with men, where if we meet a face We almost meet a friend, on naked Moors With long, long ways before, by Cottage Bench Or Well-spring where the weary Traveller rests. I love a public road: few sights there are That please me more; such object hath had power O'er my imagination since the dawn Of childhood, when its disappearing line, Seen daily afar off, on one bare steep Beyond the limits which my feet had trod Was like a guide into eternity, At least to things unknown and without bound. Even something of the grandeur which invests The Mariner who sails the roaring sea Through storm and darkness early in my mind Surrounded, too, the Wanderers of the Earth, Grandeur as much, and loveliness far more; Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites, From many other uncouth Vagrants pass'd In fear, have walk'd with quicker step; but why Take note of this? When I began to inquire, To watch and question those I met, and held Familiar talk with them, the lonely roads Were schools to me in which I daily read With most delight the passions of mankind, There saw into the depth of human souls, Souls that appear to have no depth at all To vulgar eyes. And now convinced at heart How little that to which alone we give The name of education hath to do With real feeling and just sense, how vain A correspondence with the talking world Proves to the most, and call'd to make good search If man's estate, by doom of Nature yoked With toil, is therefore yoked with ignorance, If virtue be indeed so hard to rear, And intellectual strength so rare a boon I prized such walks still more; for there I found Hope to my hope, and to my pleasure peace, And steadiness; and healing and repose To every angry passion. There I heard, From mouths of lowly men and of obscure A tale of honour; sounds in unison With loftiest promises of good and fair. There are who think that strong affections, love Known by whatever name, is falsely deem'd A gift, to use a term which they would use, Of vulgar Nature, that its growth requires Retirement, leisure, language purified By manners thoughtful and elaborate, That whoso feels such passion in excess Must live within the very light and air Of elegances that are made by man. True is it, where oppression worse than death Salutes the Being at his birth, where grace Of culture hath been utterly unknown, And labour in excess and poverty From day to day pre-occupy the ground Of the affections, and to Nature's self Oppose a deeper nature, there indeed, Love cannot be; nor does it easily thrive In cities, where the human heart is sick, And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed: Thus far, no further, is that inference good. Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feel How we mislead each other, above all How Books mislead us, looking for their fame To judgments of the wealthy Few, who see By artificial lights, how they debase The Many for the pleasure of those Few Effeminately level down the truth To certain general notions for the sake Of being understood at once, or else Through want of better knowledge in the men Who frame them, flattering thus our self-conceit With pictures that ambitiously set forth The differences, the outward marks by which Society has parted man from man, Neglectful of the universal heart. Here calling up to mind what then I saw A youthful Traveller, and see daily now Before me in my rural neighbourhood, Here might I pause, and bend in reverence To Nature, and the power of human minds, To men as they are men within themselves. How oft high service is perform'd within, When all the external man is rude in shew, Not like a temple rich with pomp and gold But a mere mountain-Chapel such as shields Its simple worshippers from sun and shower. Of these, said I, shall be my Song; of these, If future years mature me for the task, Will I record the praises, making Verse Deal boldly with substantial things, in truth And sanctity of passion, speak of these That justice may be done, obeisance paid Where it is due: thus haply shall I teach, Inspire, through unadulterated ears Pour rapture, tenderness, and hope, my theme No other than the very heart of man As found among the best of those who live Not unexalted by religious hope, Nor uninformed by books, good books though few, In Nature's presence: thence may I select Sorrow that is not sorrow, but delight, And miserable love that is not pain To hear of, for the glory that redounds Therefrom to human kind and what we are. Be mine to follow with no timid step Where knowledge leads me; it shall be my pride That I have dared to tread this holy ground, Speaking no dream but things oracular, Matter not lightly to be heard by those Who to the letter of the outward promise Do read the invisible soul, by men adroit In speech and for communion with the world Accomplish'd, minds whose faculties are then Most active when they are most eloquent And elevated most when most admired. Men may be found of other mold than these, Who are their own upholders, to themselves Encouragement, and energy and will, Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively words As native passion dictates. Others, too, There are among the walks of homely life Still higher, men for contemplation framed, Shy, and unpractis'd in the strife of phrase, Meek men, whose very souls perhaps would sink Beneath them, summon'd to such intercourse: Theirs is the language of the heavens, the power, The thought, the image, and the silent joy; Words are but under-agents in their souls; When they are grasping with their greatest strength They do not breathe among them: this I speak In gratitude to God, who feeds our hearts For his own service, knoweth, loveth us When we are unregarded by the world. Also about this time did I receive Convictions still more strong than heretofore Not only that the inner frame is good, And graciously composed, but that no less Nature through all conditions hath a power To consecrate, if we have eyes to see, The outside of her creatures, and to breathe Grandeur upon the very humblest face Of human life. I felt that the array Of outward circumstance and visible form Is to the pleasure of the human mind What passion makes it, that meanwhile the forms Of Nature have a passion in themselves That intermingles with those works of man To which she summons him, although the works Be mean, have nothing lofty of their own; And that the genius of the Poet hence May boldly take his way among mankind Wherever Nature leads, that he hath stood By Nature's side among the men of old, And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend, Forgive me if I say that I, who long Had harbour'd reverentially a thought That Poets, even as Prophets, each with each Connected in a mighty scheme of truth, Have each for his peculiar dower, a sense By which he is enabled to perceive Something unseen before; forgive me, Friend, If I, the meanest of this Band, had hope That unto me had also been vouchsafed An influx, that in some sort I possess'd A privilege, and that a work of mine, Proceeding from the depth of untaught things, Enduring and creative, might become A power like one of Nature's. To such mood, Once above all, a Traveller at that time Upon the Plain of Sarum was I raised; There on the pastoral Downs without a track To guide me, or along the bare white roads Lengthening in solitude their dreary line, While through those vestiges of ancient times I ranged, and by the solitude overcome, I had a reverie and saw the past, Saw multitudes of men, and here and there, A single Briton in his wolf-skin vest With shield and stone-axe, stride across the Wold; The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear Shaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength Long moulder'd of barbaric majesty. I called upon the darkness; and it took, A midnight darkness seem'd to come and take All objects from my sight; and lo! again The desart visible by dismal flames! It is the sacrificial Altar, fed With living men, how deep the groans, the voice Of those in the gigantic wicker thrills Throughout the region far and near, pervades The monumental hillocks; and the pomp Is for both worlds, the living and the dead. At other moments, for through that wide waste Three summer days I roam'd, when 'twas my chance To have before me on the dreary Plain Lines, circles, mounts, a mystery of shapes Such as in many quarters yet survive, With intricate profusion figuring o'er The untill'd ground, the work, as some divine, Of infant science, imitative forms By which the Druids covertly express'd Their knowledge of the heavens, and imaged forth The constellations, I was gently charm'd, Albeit with an antiquarian's dream, I saw the bearded Teachers, with white wands Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky Alternately, and Plain below, while breath Of music seem'd to guide them, and the Waste Was chear'd with stillness and a pleasant sound. This for the past, and things that may be view'd Or fancied, in the obscurities of time. Nor is it, Friend, unknown to thee, at least Thyself delighted, who for my delight Hast said, perusing some imperfect verse Which in that lonesome journey was composed, That also then I must have exercised Upon the vulgar forms of present things And actual world of our familiar days, A higher power, have caught from them a tone, An image, and a character, by books Not hitherto reflected. Call we this But a persuasion taken up by Thee In friendship; yet the mind is to herself Witness and judge, and I remember well That in life's every-day appearances I seem'd about this period to have sight Of a new world, a world, too, that was fit To be transmitted and made visible To other eyes, as having for its base That whence our dignity originates, That which both gives it being and maintains A balance, an ennobling interchange Of action from within and from without, The excellence, pure spirit, and best power Both of the object seen, and eye that sees. BOOK THIRTEENTH CONCLUSION In one of these excursions, travelling then Through Wales on foot, and with a youthful Friend, I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time, And westward took my way to see the sun Rise from the top of Snowdon. Having reach'd The Cottage at the Mountain's foot, we there Rouz'd up the Shepherd, who by ancient right Of office is the Stranger's usual guide; And after short refreshment sallied forth. It was a Summer's night, a close warm night, Wan, dull and glaring, with a dripping mist Low-hung and thick that cover'd all the sky, Half threatening storm and rain; but on we went Uncheck'd, being full of heart and having faith In our tried Pilot. Little could we see Hemm'd round on every side with fog and damp, And, after ordinary travellers' chat With our Conductor, silently we sank Each into commerce with his private thoughts: Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself Was nothing either seen or heard the while Which took me from my musings, save that once The Shepherd's Cur did to his own great joy Unearth a hedgehog in the mountain crags Round which he made a barking turbulent. This small adventure, for even such it seemed In that wild place and at the dead of night, Being over and forgotten, on we wound In silence as before. With forehead bent Earthward, as if in opposition set Against an enemy, I panted up With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts. Thus might we wear perhaps an hour away, Ascending at loose distance each from each, And I, as chanced, the foremost of the Band; When at my feet the ground appear'd to brighten, And with a step or two seem'd brighter still; Nor had I time to ask the cause of this, For instantly a Light upon the turf Fell like a flash: I looked about, and lo! The Moon stood naked in the Heavens, at height Immense above my head, and on the shore I found myself of a huge sea of mist, Which, meek and silent, rested at my feet: A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved All over this still Ocean, and beyond, Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves, In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, Into the Sea, the real Sea, that seem'd To dwindle, and give up its majesty, Usurp'd upon as far as sight could reach. Meanwhile, the Moon look'd down upon this shew In single glory, and we stood, the mist Touching our very feet; and from the shore At distance not the third part of a mile Was a blue chasm; a fracture in the vapour, A deep and gloomy breathing-place through which Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams Innumerable, roaring with one voice. The universal spectacle throughout Was shaped for admiration and delight, Grand in itself alone, but in that breach Through which the homeless voice of waters rose, That dark deep thoroughfare had Nature lodg'd The Soul, the Imagination of the whole. A meditation rose in me that night Upon the lonely Mountain when the scene Had pass'd away, and it appear'd to me The perfect image of a mighty Mind, Of one that feeds upon infinity, That is exalted by an underpresence, The sense of God, or whatsoe'er is dim Or vast in its own being, above all One function of such mind had Nature there Exhibited by putting forth, and that With circumstance most awful and sublime, That domination which she oftentimes Exerts upon the outward face of things, So moulds them, and endues, abstracts, combines, Or by abrupt and unhabitual influence Doth make one object so impress itself Upon all others, and pervade them so That even the grossest minds must see and hear And cannot chuse but feel. The Power which these Acknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus Thrusts forth upon the senses, is the express Resemblance, in the fulness of its strength Made visible, a genuine Counterpart And Brother of the glorious faculty Which higher minds bear with them as their own. That is the very spirit in which they deal With all the objects of the universe; They from their native selves can send abroad Like transformations, for themselves create A like existence, and, whene'er it is Created for them, catch it by an instinct; Them the enduring and the transient both Serve to exalt; they build up greatest things From least suggestions, ever on the watch, Willing to work and to be wrought upon, They need not extraordinary calls To rouze them, in a world of life they live, By sensible impressions not enthrall'd, But quicken'd, rouz'd, and made thereby more apt To hold communion with the invisible world. Such minds are truly from the Deity, For they are Powers; and hence the highest bliss That can be known is theirs, the consciousness Of whom they are habitually infused Through every image, and through every thought, And all impressions; hence religion, faith, And endless occupation for the soul Whether discursive or intuitive; Hence sovereignty within and peace at will Emotion which best foresight need not fear Most worthy then of trust when most intense. Hence chearfulness in every act of life Hence truth in moral judgements and delight That fails not in the external universe. Oh! who is he that hath his whole life long Preserved, enlarged, this freedom in himself? For this alone is genuine Liberty: Witness, ye Solitudes! where I received My earliest visitations, careless then Of what was given me, and where now I roam, A meditative, oft a suffering Man, And yet, I trust, with undiminish'd powers, Witness, whatever falls my better mind, Revolving with the accidents of life, May have sustain'd, that, howsoe'er misled, I never, in the quest of right and wrong, Did tamper with myself from private aims; Nor was in any of my hopes the dupe Of selfish passions; nor did wilfully Yield ever to mean cares and low pursuits; But rather did with jealousy shrink back From every combination that might aid The tendency, too potent in itself, Of habit to enslave the mind, I mean Oppress it by the laws of vulgar sense, And substitute a universe of death, The falsest of all worlds, in place of that Which is divine and true. To fear and love, To love as first and chief, for there fear ends, Be this ascribed; to early intercourse, In presence of sublime and lovely forms, With the adverse principles of pain and joy, Evil as one is rashly named by those Who know not what they say. By love, for here Do we begin and end, all grandeur comes, All truth and beauty, from pervading love, That gone, we are as dust. Behold the fields In balmy spring-time, full of rising flowers And happy creatures; see that Pair, the Lamb And the Lamb's Mother, and their tender ways Shall touch thee to the heart; in some green bower Rest, and be not alone, but have thou there The One who is thy choice of all the world, There linger, lull'd and lost, and rapt away, Be happy to thy fill; thou call'st this love And so it is, but there is higher love Than this, a love that comes into the heart With awe and a diffusive sentiment; Thy love is human merely; this proceeds More from the brooding Soul, and is divine. This love more intellectual cannot be Without Imagination, which, in truth, Is but another name for absolute strength And clearest insight, amplitude of mind, And reason in her most exalted mood. This faculty hath been the moving soul Of our long labour: we have traced the stream From darkness, and the very place of birth In its blind cavern, whence is faintly heard The sound of waters; follow'd it to light And open day, accompanied its course Among the ways of Nature, afterwards Lost sight of it bewilder'd and engulph'd, Then given it greeting, as it rose once more With strength, reflecting in its solemn breast The works of man and face of human life, And lastly, from its progress have we drawn The feeling of life endless, the great thought By which we live, Infinity and God. Imagination having been our theme, So also hath that intellectual love, For they are each in each, and cannot stand Dividually.—Here must thou be, O Man! Strength to thyself; no Helper hast thou here; Here keepest thou thy individual state: No other can divide with thee this work, No secondary hand can intervene To fashion this ability; 'tis thine, The prime and vital principle is thine In the recesses of thy nature, far From any reach of outward fellowship, Else is not thine at all. But joy to him, Oh, joy to him who here hath sown, hath laid Here the foundations of his future years! For all that friendship, all that love can do, All that a darling countenance can look Or dear voice utter to complete the man, Perfect him, made imperfect in himself, All shall be his: and he whose soul hath risen Up to the height of feeling intellect Shall want no humbler tenderness, his heart Be tender as a nursing Mother's heart; Of female softness shall his life be full, Of little loves and delicate desires, Mild interests and gentlest sympathies. Child of my Parents! Sister of my Soul! Elsewhere have streams of gratitude been breath'd To thee for all the early tenderness Which I from thee imbibed. And true it is That later seasons owed to thee no less; For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touch Of other kindred hands that open'd out The springs of tender thought in infancy, And spite of all which singly I had watch'd Of elegance, and each minuter charm In nature and in life, still to the last Even to the very going out of youth, The period which our Story now hath reach'd, I too exclusively esteem'd that love, And sought that beauty, which, as Milton sings, Hath terror in it. Thou didst soften down This over-sternness; but for thee, sweet Friend, My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had been Far longer what by Nature it was framed, Longer retain'd its countenance severe, A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds Familiar, and a favourite of the Stars: But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers, Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze, And teach the little birds to build their nests And warble in its chambers. At a time When Nature, destined to remain so long Foremost in my affections, had fallen back Into a second place, well pleas'd to be A handmaid to a nobler than herself, When every day brought with it some new sense Of exquisite regard for common things, And all the earth was budding with these gifts Of more refined humanity, thy breath, Dear Sister, was a kind of gentler spring That went before my steps. With such a theme, Coleridge! with this my argument, of thee Shall I be silent? O most loving Soul! Placed on this earth to love and understand, And from thy presence shed the light of love, Shall I be mute ere thou be spoken of? Thy gentle Spirit to my heart of hearts Did also find its way; and thus the life Of all things and the mighty unity In all which we behold, and feel, and are, Admitted more habitually a mild Interposition, and closelier gathering thoughts Of man and his concerns, such as become A human Creature, be he who he may! Poet, or destined for a humbler name; And so the deep enthusiastic joy, The rapture of the Hallelujah sent From all that breathes and is, was chasten'd, stemm'd And balanced by a Reason which indeed Is reason; duty and pathetic truth; And God and Man divided, as they ought, Between them the great system of the world Where Man is sphered, and which God animates. And now, O Friend! this history is brought To its appointed close: the discipline And consummation of the Poet's mind, In everything that stood most prominent, Have faithfully been pictured; we have reach'd The time (which was our object from the first) When we may, not presumptuously, I hope, Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and such My knowledge, as to make me capable Of building up a work that should endure. Yet much hath been omitted, as need was; Of Books how much! and even of the other wealth That is collected among woods and fields, Far more: for Nature's secondary grace, That outward illustration which is here, Hath hitherto been barely touched upon, The charm more superficial, and yet sweet Which from her works finds way, contemplated As they hold forth a genuine counterpart And softening mirror of the moral world. Yes, having track'd the main essential Power, Imagination, up her way sublime, In turn might Fancy also be pursued Through all her transmigrations, till she too Was purified, had learn'd to ply her craft By judgment steadied. Then might we return And in the Rivers and the Groves behold Another face, might hear them from all sides Calling upon the more instructed mind To link their images with subtle skill Sometimes, and by elaborate research With forms and definite appearances Of human life, presenting them sometimes To the involuntary sympathy Of our internal being, satisfied And soothed with a conception of delight Where meditation cannot come, which thought Could never heighten. Above all how much Still nearer to ourselves we overlook In human nature and that marvellous world As studied first in my own heart, and then In life among the passions of mankind And qualities commix'd and modified By the infinite varieties and shades Of individual character. Therein It was for me (this justice bids me say) No useless preparation to have been The pupil of a public School, and forced In hardy independence, to stand up Amid conflicting passions, and the shock Of various tempers, to endure and note What was not understood though known to be; Among the mysteries of love and hate, Honour and shame, looking to right and left, Uncheck'd by innocence too delicate And moral notions too intolerant, Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when call'd To take a station among Men, the step Was easier, the transition more secure, More profitable also; for the mind Learns from such timely exercise to keep In wholesome separation the two natures, The one that feels, the other that observes. Yet one word more of personal circumstance, Not needless, as it seems, be added here. Since I withdrew unwillingly from France, The Story hath demanded less regard To time and place; and where I lived, and how Hath been no longer scrupulously mark'd. Three years, until a permanent abode Receiv'd me with that Sister of my heart Who ought by rights the dearest to have been Conspicuous through this biographic Verse, Star seldom utterly conceal'd from view, I led an undomestic Wanderer's life, In London chiefly was my home, and thence Excursively, as personal friendships, chance Or inclination led, or slender means Gave leave, I roam'd about from place to place Tarrying in pleasant nooks, wherever found Through England or through Wales. A Youth (he bore The name of Calvert; it shall live, if words Of mine can give it life,) without respect To prejudice or custom, having hope That I had some endowments by which good Might be promoted, in his last decay From his own Family withdrawing part Of no redundant Patrimony, did By a Bequest sufficient for my needs Enable me to pause for choice, and walk At large and unrestrain'd, nor damp'd too soon By mortal cares. Himself no Poet, yet Far less a common Spirit of the world, He deem'd that my pursuits and labours lay Apart from all that leads to wealth, or even Perhaps to necessary maintenance, Without some hazard to the finer sense; He clear'd a passage for me, and the stream Flowed in the bent of Nature. Having now Told what best merits mention, further pains Our present purpose seems not to require, And I have other tasks. Call back to mind The mood in which this Poem was begun, O Friend! the termination of my course Is nearer now, much nearer; yet even then In that distraction and intense desire I said unto the life which I had lived, Where art thou? Hear I not a voice from thee Which 'tis reproach to hear? Anon I rose As if on wings, and saw beneath me stretch'd Vast prospect of the world which I had been And was; and hence this Song, which like a lark I have protracted, in the unwearied Heavens Singing, and often with more plaintive voice Attempered to the sorrows of the earth; Yet centring all in love, and in the end All gratulant if rightly understood. Whether to me shall be allotted life, And with life power to accomplish aught of worth Sufficient to excuse me in men's sight For having given this Record of myself, Is all uncertain: but, beloved Friend, When, looking back thou seest in clearer view Than any sweetest sight of yesterday That summer when on Quantock's grassy Hills Far ranging, and among her sylvan Combs, Thou in delicious words, with happy heart, Didst speak the Vision of that Ancient Man, The bright-eyed Mariner, and rueful woes Didst utter of the Lady Christabel; And I, associate with such labour, walk'd Murmuring of him who, joyous hap! was found, After the perils of his moonlight ride Near the loud Waterfall; or her who sate In misery near the miserable Thorn; When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts, And hast before thee all which then we were, To thee, in memory of that happiness It will be known, by thee at least, my Friend, Felt, that the history of a Poet's mind Is labour not unworthy of regard: To thee the work shall justify itself. The last and later portions of this Gift Which I for Thee design, have been prepared In times which have from those wherein we first Together wanton'd in wild Poesy, Differ'd thus far, that they have been, my Friend, Times of much sorrow, of a private grief Keen and enduring, which the frame of mind That in this meditative History Hath been described, more deeply makes me feel; Yet likewise hath enabled me to bear More firmly; and a comfort now, a hope, One of the dearest which this life can give, Is mine; that Thou art near, and wilt be soon Restored to us in renovated health; When, after the first mingling of our tears, 'Mong other consolations we may find Some pleasure from this Offering of my love. Oh! yet a few short years of useful life, And all will be complete, thy race be run, Thy monument of glory will be raised. Then, though, too weak to tread the ways of truth, This Age fall back to old idolatry, Though men return to servitude as fast As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame By Nations sink together, we shall still Find solace in the knowledge which we have, Bless'd with true happiness if we may be United helpers forward of a day Of firmer trust, joint-labourers in a work (Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe) Of their redemption, surely yet to come. Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak A lasting inspiration, sanctified By reason and by truth; what we have loved, Others will love; and we may teach them how; Instruct them how the mind of man becomes A thousand times more beautiful than the earth On which he dwells, above this Frame of things (Which, 'mid all revolution in the hopes And fears of men, doth still remain unchanged) In beauty exalted, as it is itself Of substance and of fabric more divine.</field>
