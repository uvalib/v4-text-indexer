      <field name="fulltext">DEMOCRITUS IN LONDON.Speakers' names in this text have been abbreviated. The following abbreviations have been used for the major characters: For Pumpkin read Pumpkin Plethoric For Sir P. read Sir Peter Prolix For Dem. read Democritus Scene I.—A Street in Windsor. Enter Democritus. From the courts above a visitor Hither come I, an inquisitor Not in philosophic stole, But the dress of English Droll. For in that memorable year When Mercury turn'd auctioneer, Putting up for sale a number Of rare wits, like household lumber! Many of the wisest sconces Did not fetch the price of dunce's, And for laugher's and for cryer's There were neither bidders, buyers! Knowing not in London town If for philosophic crown Up the market was or down, But believing that a Vice Always brings a liberal price! Motley is the name I bear, Motley is the coat I wear. Invited, I before had come, But that I should, abash'd and dumb, Have from your Sage received the shell He struck so wisely and so well! When in of Greece the early age I strutted, fretted on life's stage The character to me assign'd Puzzled the Athenian mind. For in my brain the civic train Suspecting something not quite sane, Forced Hippocrates their fees on To set once more right my reason. Sitting in my quiet cottage, Not exactly in my dotage! No shrewish wife, no stupid kin, No duns without, no quacks within, I saw the learned leech elate Unlatch my little garden gate. Putting on his conjuring cap, In hopes my vagrant wits to trap! From his pocket peep'd a packet Very like a certain jacket! Giving his head a shake or two, And looking wise—as doctors do! All the while my bright brass basin Ogling at his solemn face in! He began a drowsy discourse Recommending that and this course, Which my retort cut sharply short, For I was in no humour for't! Abruptly turning on his heel, He rang the city this quaint peal— “Give the laughing devil his due— The man's not mad, my friends, but You!” —Tu Quoque! fits the cap? some few! Tho' folly, flaunting up and down This phantasmagorian town, Her antiquated coat has cast, I, in the present, see the past; Than folly neither more, nor less, But only in a different dress; Time has made her naught the wiser, As will find the fool that tries her! Patriotism holding league With ambition and intrigue— Worldly honesty—whose check Is the halter round his neck! Worldly wisdom—craft and cunning, All out-witting and out-running! Friendship,—not the glow-worm spark That shines upon us in the dark, But fair-weather's follower fervent, Fawning flattery's fellow-servant! Ingrate's smile—like coffin-plate Over rottenness in state! Temperance—sober from satiety! Plausible professing Piety— Eyes devoutly raised to heaven, Hearts to earth entirely given! Good intentions, that might pave Pandemonium!—To his grave Dissipation, dancing, piping! Hoary avarice, grasping, griping! Pomp, venality, and pride— In their favor wind and tide, Passing, with averted eye, Slighted blighted poverty! Base Detraction—ever first Of his friend to think the worst, Prompted by some merit great First to envy, then to hate! Vain Philosophy—in youth, Sinking, soaring after truth, At the bottom of the hill, Baffled, and enquiring still! Self—the plague-spot that infects All societies and sects, That opes to every vice the door, Corrupts of every heart the core! Knowledge new—of which the sum is, Fools your fathers were, and dummies! Law—in subtleties refined! Justice—deaf, as well as blind! Charity—retiring soul! That hangs her lantern on a pole. Honor—that blows out your brains, But pays his debts—the gambler's gains! Dulness—making war upon sense, Bubbles—blown with windy nonsense! Woman's Love—as warm as summer To the cash-replenish'd comer! Woman's Tongue—uncertain thing! Honied barb, or fiery sting! Are here as clever in their craft As when at fools, not with, I laugh'd, And Athens sent her learned leech To practise on me and to preach, And, for as yet had Rome to pour, Her legions on your barbarous shore, And yoke you captives to her car, And tame you into what you are! In his wild woods the Briton ran, A naked, painted, savage man! So much mischief brew'd and brewing, What have been your parsons doing? Slow to preach, or slow to hear, They, or you, Sirs? Both, I fear! Or have they with a careless hand Held slack the reins of stern command, And let the steed which has most sway, That steed unruly! run away? Or have they metaphysic mud Stirr'd from the bottom of the flood? That shallow pool which makes pretence To something more than common sense! Or have they vainly tried to scan Mysteries never made for man, And then left off where they began? O, folly rare! foundation fair Of some rich temple to lay bare Just to show to curious eyes How deep that firm foundation lies! Not by its root, but by its fruit The tree's just value we compute; The faith wherein the virtues shine, We know, like beauty, is divine! Greece, the seat of heroes, sages, Gods! and gray with glorious ages! How sad the moral, how august That time has written in her dust! Every moss-clad mouldering stone, Temple, tower, with grass o'ergrown, Crumbling column, ruin'd, rent, How profoundly eloquent! Mute mournful monitors are they Of grandeur, beauty, and decay! By pilgrims sought from every shore, No Shrine was ever worshipp'd more! Beheld with throbbing heart, with eyes Of mingled rapture and surprise! And mused upon in future years With sweet regret and quiet tears! Debased by sloth, unnerved by ease The countrymen of Pericles Live but the timid life of slaves, Rot in ignominious graves! A penance for their fathers' crimes, A looking-glass for present times! Amid the cloud that darkly roll'd O'er future worlds in days of old One god-like spirit, only one! Had glimpses of the rising sun. Greece, to whom was given the prize, Turn'd her back and closed her eyes To the bright celestial ray That glorifies your happier day! Phœbus gilds the mountain tops Ere he shines upon the copse And his noon-tide glory throws On the humblest flower that blows; Thus eternal truth we find Lights up first the lofty mind, Then, with unmitigated ray, On lowlier visions pours the day! From the “Writing on the Wall,” From a Greek and Roman Fall, Britain, give desert its due, What indemnity have you? Yours the inconsistent tact is, Christian precept, pagan practice; In proportion as is true Your religion, false are you! When on some peaceful prosperous land You've pour'd trade's greedy, ruthless band, Carved with the sword, and writ in flame The terrors of the Christian name! And, to the music of deep groans, Whiten'd the soil with human bones! You bid her sons their gods abjure For one wise, holy, just, and pure! —“Men of slaughter! men of plunder! The poor heathen asks with wonder, Hath he lightning, hath he thunder?” Grecian arts you Britons borrow; Grecian relics, day of sorrow! Wresting from their native soil, You have made the plunderer's spoil. Would your intellectual march Uprear the column, bend the arch, The never-dying foliage wreathe, And bid the senseless marble breathe? Fair Greece supplies each rich design, Hers the original divine! Her poets long have been your theme, Your midnight study, morning dream! Enthroned in majesty of thought Your youth have they sublimely taught! The Grove, Lyceum, and the Porch Lighted of eloquence your torch, And full many a noble band Bear impress of their master's hand! Her philosophers of old Taught, 'tis said, but morals cold, Reformer none could Athens boast To rule some new religion's roast Such as Smithfield, by your leave, a Roasting region! taught Geneva— Yet, unawed by fiery stake, Was virtue loved for virtue's sake. Her august, heroic story Wins for Britons crowns of glory, Teaching, by its example high, How nobly men can live and die! Her lofty language to your own Has given an eloquence, a tone; Her follies, added to the spoil, Have flourish'd in your fruitful soil! All antiquity has taught, Every noble deed and thought Time has to your treasury brought— From ancient learning's page august With hand most reverent sweep the dust! And from Academic bowers Cast the weeds, but spare the flowers. From the courts above a visitor, (Mr. Motley the inquisitor!) I the pabulum am after Looking that I live on—Laughter! What fresh folly rich and racy, Turning town and country crazy! Does the Phœbus of to-day see? Helter-skelter, in full cry, Hither flock the village fry! Quidnuncs queer, whose daily diet Is rebellion, rapine, riot, With an appetite and swallow Beating the Athenian hollow! Enter Gaffer Grig, followed by the Town's-folk. 1st Townsman. Neighbour! neighbour! What new mountain is in labour? Is the earthquake coming down? Is the comet's tail in town? Here I am Slippery Sam Of the Lion and Lamb! And scarlet Dick Of Hampton-Wick, And Solomon Slim, And Gaby Grim, And Margery Glib, And Trimming Tib, And Mat the Miller and his rib! All agog to hear the news That makes you shiver and shake in your shoes! And, Goodman Grig, Disorders your wig! Song, Gaffer Grig. The day is fast coming of doom, The Castle's astonish'd! astounded! From the Master of Horse to the Groom Answer I'll not for a sound head! For suddenly came marching in, Surely the couple were crazy! O, such a riotous Chin! O, such a rollicking Jazey! The Porter rang for the Page, The Page rang the Exon his mate in, And the Exon rang, in a rage, The Stick Gold or Silver of State in! I from this deuce of a din Turn'd to the right about quick, Leaving the Jazey and Chin Strutting up stairs to the Stick! Chorus of Town's-folk. From Gunpowder, treason and brawl God save Queen Victoria! We can't understand it at all; A mighty mysterious story, ah! [Exeunt. Dem. In of Bull the addled brain, There's a maggot got again! Some new bee, depend upon it, Now is buzzing in his bonnet! [Exit. Scene II.—A Chamber in Windsor Castle. A Lord in Waiting and a Gentleman Usher discovered. Usher. Strangers two your Lordship's leisure Wait— Lord. Whence come they? what's their pleasure? Usher. From Bow-Bells— Lord. Bow-Bells! by the by, Did you, Mr. Usher, spy In their foreheads, blazing high, One great goggling gooseberry eye? Is not Bow a certain town, Topsy-turvy, upside down, Every man upon his crown? Bow-Bells! where the devil! where is Bow?—among the Pawnees, prairies? Where the Rocky-mountain bear is? Bristling on my head my hair is! Admit the nondescripts, but mind, They leave their tomahawks behind! I hope the cannibals have dined! [Exit Usher. Re-enter Gentleman Usher, introducing Sir Peter Prolix and Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric. Usher. Sir Peter Prolix. Lord (aside). By this light, A City Alderman and Knight! A foie gras With chapeau bras! Usher. Pumpkin Plethoric, Esquire. [Exit. Lord (aside). Rosy as a curtail Friar! What a bow-window the mutton's Built beneath his bright brass buttons! Now and then must even crown'd heads Condescend to humor roundheads, And belted knights and garter'd earls To common people cast their pearls! The business of these obesities Gastronomical I guess it is! Song, Sir Peter. One terrible night we saw such a sight! The Lord of the Lions of London Our Burse, in a blaze! our town in amaze Our trade, pro tempore, undone! Now blessed reverse! both business and burse Sick are no longer and sorry, For commerce again will be soon in her fane, The quintessence quite of a quarry! We post to-day to petition and pray The Crown, with sceptre and garter, Prancing in state with the cream-color'd eight, (And the more blue-ribbon'd the smarter!) With the Beef-eating chaps in their muffin caps, And the Guards in their helmets glist'ning, Will drive us poor cits fairly out of our wits By coming to honor the christ'ning. In pitiful plight for a feast and a sight Is each municipal member, He wants to go thro' a rehearsal or two Against the ninth of November! Lord (aside). That ever I should live, ha! ha! To hear an alderman sol fa. —Citizens, the Lord's Anointed Has commanded and appointed Tom Thumb to try his mimic power, On royal ennui for an hour. Crowns, with high debate and discourse, Overdone, have taken this course. King Hal made much of mimes and mummers, His wag was Will, the famous Summers; Queen Bess, when sorrowful and sick, “Undumpish'd” was by Tarleton Dick! And Archee Armstrong often burst The sides of good King Charles the First. These jesters of the ancient schools, Mark me, were “material” Fools, Their quaint parlousness and patter Pregnant were with mind and matter, Their words were swords, their ready wit Shone brightest in their use of it! Now this Merry-Andrew's greatest Merit is that he's the latest, Tho' judging from experience past, He is not like to be the last! When the Imperial Presence from In state has strutted tiny Tom, I, your baterie de cuisine Will humbly lay before the Queen, And your dutiful petition For Her Majesty's commission. Touching this momentous measure You shall know the Sovereign's pleasure. [Exit. Sir P. . . . . Ye diplomatic spirits crown My head with laurels! drop me down From your amaranthine bowers Bouquets, for the victory's ours! Pumpkin. . . . . Haunch of venison, hot and smoking! Cherry sauce, piquant, provoking! And a bottle of the best Make me, too, completely blest! Song, Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric. In nectarine streams all purple beams Let me lovingly lave my lip, Then, for a spree, shall gallopade glee, And toes trot out on a frolicksome trip! At every draught so merrily quaff'd Cupid Dan shall open his fire, From some wicked eye an arrow let fly, And turn his gas on higher and higher! Then, by the mass! let bumpers pass; Now for a bottle from Bacchus's bin! I long for a quiz at my festivous phiz In the glass that I hold 'twixt my nose and my chin! [Exeunt. Scene III.—The Long Walk, Windsor. Enter Democritus.Democritus. Not by Motley Coat alone I have found the Fool is known, Seldom he abroad appears Wearing his symbolic ears, Girded with his dagger wooden, And his coxcomb, bells, and hood on! Hence of laughter the loud burst, As if I were Fool the First! The stupid stare from high and low, And pointed finger as I go, Quizzing my uncommon costume, Past and primitive and posthume! Knowing what a favourite school A royal court is to the Fool, Where, slippery ground! the idol crown'd He loves to dance attendance round. Thus professionally frock'd At yon palace gate I knock'd, And discover'd in a second I without my host had reckon'd. Fools must there to gain admittance Cry with Coat of Motley quittance! A liveried lacquey stopp'd my path, And look'd at, leeringly, my lath! But served not so another sword Whose Fool, by good luck! was a Lord. Lo, a garter! in a crack he Bows it in, discerning lacquey! Dangling from a privy pocket, See, a Key! the gate! unlock it! Mark, to a judicial jazey What judicious homage pays he! In the presence of a crozier He's as supple as an osier! Ushering in a strawberry leaf Down goes, bob! his head of beef! And before a royal bubble He is really nearly double! My Lord Parvenu, whose peerage Makes rare quizzing for this queer age, Full of new, grotesque gentilities, In his ermine O, how ill at ease! And, a proper pair! the pigmy Past, both looking mighty big! me, Seeming each to say, “Your coat is Very much beneath my notice!” Among the miscellaneous crowd That in were so politely bow'd, Not one Fool I must confess Saw I in his proper dress, From the beaver to the boot All had put off Motley's suit! Did ever laughter break its fast On a more risible repast? Make merrier meal upon the daws And peacocks of the world's applause? —Day declines—how dark to one From a world where sets no sun! Yet how beautiful! how bright, In her darkness, is the night! Centuries have roll'd away Since I beheld yon lunar ray Light up a dreaming world! and heard, As now I hear, my favourite bird. Chantress, to my home on high Could'st thou but take wings and fly! Such sweet songs should never die. . . The Scene closes. Scene IV.—The Castle Tavern, Windsor. Sir Peter Prolix and Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric at their dessert and wine. Pumpkin. I, my Lord Chief Joker, miss'd Of your jingling jest the gist, Prithee let me cry, Sir Peter, Encore to that merry metre! Sir. P. What exclaim'd the gallant Napier, Proudly flourishing his rapier! To the army and the navy, When he conquered Scinde?—“Peccavi!” Pumpkin. “Not one swallow makes a summer,” Said old Sherry to his rummer— I must have another rosy Glass to make me warm and cosey. Water never tempts me to it, Sworn at Highgate, I eschew it When there's claret in the cruet. Enter Waiter. Boy! have you a vintage brighter, Purer, more translucent, lighter, Of a deeper, richer ruby, Fit to swear your mistress true by? A mighty magnum introduce Of that genial, genuine juice. [Exit Waiter. Sir P. Pumpkin, he who dreads to die Don't deserve to live, say I! Intrepidity of soul Soon rekindles, like hot coal! A puff revives the slumbering spark— When I beheld in Windsor Park Colors flying, troops parading, Heard the music, cannonading, (As in my volunteering days, When call'd the Compter's siege to raise, I turn'd my back on shots and shells, And bivouac'd at Bagnigge Wells!) Dulce et decorum est Thought I, as I thumpt my breast, Pro—'pon honor!—patria mori— How sweet and pleasant To be shot like a pheasant— Pumpkin. Always excepting the company present!— Sir P. Con amore, For honor and glory! Pumpkin. Sir Peter! Sir Peter! a very fine story Over Johannisberg, after John Dory! Is not Peace's modern March meant— Sir P. Pure's palaver, pens, and parchment!— Pumpkin. For the— Sir P. Revolution—Robber, Fudge! with his fraternal slobber, Greasy jowl and frouzy whisker Courting all Cockayne to kiss, cur! Bull's old-fashion'd arbitrator Whizzing from the cannon's crater, Nelson's broadsides, Arthur's thunder! Better makes the knave knock under. Enter Waiter with Wine. Pumpkin. Ha! Ganymede has made good speed, Lusitania's grape indeed! Bottled up in all its beauty, Full of years, yet fresh and fruity! Star of Brunswick! Prince, and Issue, Long and merry lives we wish you! Sings. Here's to our Queen, in the true Hippocrene! Here's to His Highness her Spouse, and The Progeny all of Crown, Sceptre, and Ball, And may they years live a thousand! Happy and free! With 'em may we, Loyalists loving, those years live to see! Chorus. Pumpkin and Sir Peter. Happy and free! &amp;c. Sir P. Pupil not of Mars, but Mozart, Thou, by thy round chin and nose, art, To thy very marrow bone a Son of Bacchus, not Bellona! Follow this Falernian fluid Let a stave— Pumpkin. Grinning? grave! Droll or dismal? Sir P. Droll, my druid! Song, Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric. Sir Walter the Brave, the redoubtable Raleigh Put under his nose a tobacco pipe daily, Finding life's sorrows his spirit that bow'd Grew dimmer and dimmer when seen thro'a cloud! While puffing his pet he did not forget To moisten his whistle and whiff with a wet, And the Queen's Head and Crown in Islington town Bore, for its brewing, the brightest renown. Sir Walter had grown exceedingly prone To pop, for a pipe, in that noddle his own! With a festivous few he bibo'd and blew, Puffing for twenty and tippling for two! Quoth Walter the Brave to his half-witted knave Who knew not the weed wafted o'er by the wave, “Bring me ale some in, that Elinour Rumming, “Right good, might have brew'd—nappy, sparkling and humming!” Then his pipe forth he drew and set lustily to 'Till his nostrils and mouth came the smoke curling thro'! Quicker and quicker the smoke curl'd, and thicker! When Simon the Simple march'd in with the liquor! “Fire! fire! fire!”—Nor stopp'd to enquire Anything further the terrified crier! But flung, in a crack, all the liquor, alack! Full in the Knight's face from the jolly Black Jack! Sir Walter up rose to slit the knave's nose For soiling and spoiling his countenance, clothes; O how the rogue roared when he saw the drawn sword, And begg'd, on his knees, not to have his sconce scored! The Knight disabused, simple Simon excused, The jack was replenish'd, the pipe was re-fused, And, talking of smoke, in his parlour of oak Mine Host, with the jorum, still serves up the joke! O Jamie! King Jamie! thy stupid crown'd head Reposed to the last on a soft downy bed, But Walter's red scaffold, blush! blush! “Right Divine,” Was glory's proud pillow, mean tyrant! to thine. Sir P. Live to sing some racy relic on Festive days, sweet Swan of Helicon! When the rosy god of wine Makes our happy faces shine! A murrain on that organ player! [A street organ is heard. Gramercy! what a grind was there! Every melody he mangles Is with music at right angles! Hark! his tuneable proboscis (Could his back my cane but cross!) is Going to give us, as a favor! Some excruciating quaver (To the love-and-murder muses An annuity the noose is!) Telling how the tender passion Tucks its tools up Tyburn fashion! The Musician's Song. In the olden time his rueful rhyme a ballad-singing clown The streets of merry Abingdon was chanting up and down, But from the squires (no ballad buyers!) few farthings did he finger, For Puck had on their purses put a padlock, a distringer! A tavern nigh just caught the eye of this poor metre-monger, How long'd for flip his thirsty lip, how crew his crop with hunger! How shiver'd, shook for ingle nook his bag of bones and skin! And, ah! how faint his tuneful plaint, “Sure Poverty's no sin!” No surly “Stand!” no hostile hand him at the porch opposed, Not him before they barr'd the door, nor yet their hearts they closed! But blazing coal, and wassail-bowl, and roasted crabs and ale Made glad a true and jolly crew, to whom he told his tale. A holy priest was at the feast, a doctor, (inter nos!) Who many a time a ballad rhyme had trowl'd at the High Cross! And risen gay at dawn of day with merry chanticleer, To wend to the wood with Robin Hood in the spring-tyde of the year! “Thy lenten nose looks lachrymose, thy tatter'd garments tell Thou'rt not too rich in purse or breech; the world don't use thee well! Jack Frost's sharp gripe has crack'd thy pipe—thou shalt not hie thee hence Until a cup has cheer'd thee up, and thou hast pouch'd some pence. “Come sit thee down, my reverend gown,” this holy doctor cry'd, “Thy sorry case will not disgrace, for this is Christmas tyde! Ah! cares HE which is poor or rich whose Advent now we hail? So thee I pledge to my goblet's edge, nor will good fellows fail!” His glass each took with kindly look in welcome to their cheer, “No Puritan,” the singer said, “no Pharisee sits here!” His heart rejoiced, his eye grew moist, his nose, too, in the light Of this carouse, out-blush'd the boughs with berries red and bright! “Thy leather frock, thy ballad stock lend me,” quoth the divine, “And I, poor knave! will launch a stave with better luck than thine; The peasant churls and village girls shall soon my pockets fill, While I sweet gentle Willy's wag Autolicus outtrill!” His gown he slipp'd, away he tripp'd, and sang what once befell, In her despair, a maiden fair who loved, alas! too well: Soft tears he drew, and pennies too! his next, a lively strain, Made mirth abound, the laugh go round, and pennies fly again! They bid for more of lyric lore—his bunch had taken flight! A L'Envoy them he chanted, “Johnny Armstrong's last Good Night,” Then chirping ran to the ballad man, and made the pennies ring, And joyfully crew, “Be as rich as a Jew, and as happy too as a King!” These Olden Times of ballad rhymes shall never more be seen, When if the wintry head was white, the heart, like spring, was green! Thou jocund priest, we hope at least, for all thy laughing leaven, That they who heard thee sing on earth now hear thee sing in heaven! Sir P. Sinking in a soft siesta To be roused by such a guest— [Enter Musician] Ah! Goblin priest of Belial's brood, With bell, book, candle, sackcloth, hood! What, fire and faggots! come again To play fresh pranks in Pudding Lane? Back to purgatory's oven, With horns, tail, and trotters cloven! Mus. First a fool, and then a friar, Sometime jester, holy prior, I, living, play'd my parts assign'd, And, dying, left my works behind— What are they? ask the halt, the blind, The sick, the helpless! hence to school, And lesson learn of Friar and Fool! O, what mumming, dancing, drumming, For six centuries hail'd the coming Of my Smithfield Saturnalia, Pomp grotesque and paraphernalia! O, how laugh'd the City 'prentice, With delight non compos mentis! To see march forth, in motley ranks, My giants, dwarfs, and mountebanks! My porcine prodigies, in letters Not a bit behind their betters! My hocus pocus sons of magic, My histrionics comic, tragic! How bumpkin gaped to see round whirl My Flying Cars! my tumblers twirl! The blue flame thro' the nostrils curl Of my Fire-Kings! and my Bottle- Conjurer jump down his own throttle! Age and youth in every booth, All that had a liquorish tooth Banquetted on dainty viand, Savory sausage, Farthing Pie, and Prime roast Pig! hot from the spit, Tempting, but ungodly bit! How danced merrily mirth's many kin To the clinking of the canikin! My penny ballads, a rare bunch! With lively portraitures of Punch, And, in propria persona, Judy, his connubial crony! To “Sellenger's” brisk, rattling “Round,” And “Packington's” old favorite “Pound,” Were garnish to some goblin tale O'er roasted crabs and cakes and ale When winter, in his hoary dress, Yet full of pleasant joyousness! Gather'd round the blazing ingle Merry gossips, married, single! Was St. Bartholomew his whims To barter for capacious brims, And Mr. Mawworm's psalms and hymns? For when did ever Simon Pure Or crop-ear'd Jack, that saint demure! (Grace, grimace, the greasy, godly Ne'er compounded were more oddly!) With their sanctimonious visor Make this wicked world the wiser? Sacrilegious and accurst, Tempting treason to its worst, They, thro' happy Britain prowling, Made her once a desert scowling, Hypocritical and howling! Roll'd down Revolution's flood Her crown and sceptre, dripping blood! On the red ruins of her throne Set up an idol of their own, And made her house of Sabbath rest For beasts a lair, for owls a nest! Witness altar, star-lit porch Sear'd and blacken'd by the torch! Holy choirs where anthems peal'd, Sparkling shrines where pilgrims kneel'd, Roofless walls where ivy creeps, Tombs where mailed warrior sleeps, And pious memory sits and weeps! Desecrated, rent asunder By—O, where was, Heaven! thy thunder?— Canting cut-throats, priests of plunder! Tears could not quench the burning brand, Nor prayers compel the impious hand To leave to time his gentle duty To touch them with sublimer beauty! Eternal hope, and truth divine Had nor sanctuary nor shrine, And gentle charity, forth driven, Took back her homeward flight to heaven!— To school, to school Of Friar and Fool! What you have received from heaven Freely give, 'twas freely given! And as you shall freely give, So shall you receive, and live! . . . [Exit. Sir P. O, for the stocks! the whipping-post! To lay your ragamuffin ghost! Enter Postilion. Post. Chaise, your honors! Pumpkin. Ha! postilion, Now for music for the million! Song, Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric. Better greased was never chin, Never body better lined, Warm without, and warm within, O, ye gods! how I have dined. Drive to merry London town, Jockey! for the Mayor inquire, Set us at his mansion down, Ply the knocker! pull the wire! Dash along thro' thick and thin, Let your steeds outstrip the wind! Warm without, and warm within, O, ye gods! how I have dined. [Exeunt Omnes. Enter Host. I'm surrounded, I'm surrounded With confusion most confounded! Hark! how my bottles, well-a-day! Are popping all their corks away! How every bell with noisy chime To every knocker's keeping time! See the room, chairs, tables, tapers, Round about me cutting capers To a jig that Hecat' pitches When at midnight dance the witches! Bully Boots, to show his breeding, Down the middle cook is leading! While Waiter Will, i'feggs! out-foots (To bouncing bar-maid buckled!) Boots! Windsor's wives pass merry lives, (Needs must when the devil drives!) Gods! some gallopading ghost is Frisking with my handsome hostess! What a shriek! what a squeak! This is like a fairy freak Beldams, huddled round the blaze, Told the imps of ancient days! I'm surrounded! I'm surrounded With confusion most confounded! [Exit. Scene V.—The Mansion House. Enter Sir Peter Prolix, Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric, and Postilion. Time, Night. Sir P. After not a pleasant drive Here we are again—alive! Little thanks, my lad, are due To your horses, or to you. Whip and spur, gee up! gee ho! Neck or nothing! on they go— One a cob, and one a colt, Now they back, and now they bolt, Now they stumble, now they stop, Up they get, and down they drop! Staggers having done their worst To make the second like the first! Post. Remember, please your honors.— Sir P. Who? Post. The postilion— Sir P. So I do! Every socket, every sinew In my body—deuce is in you! Every joint—you driving dog! Gives my memory a jog! Pumpkin. Your ramshackle team and tackle Creak have made my bones and crackle! What warlock, wizard, did bewitch The hacks you did so smartly switch Over hedge and over ditch? What invisible musician All the way, sans intermission, (Like ten thousand jacks up-winding!) Kept his hurdy-gurdy grinding? Post. I've knocked up both the horses— Sir P. There!— [Gives him money. And now, my lad, knock up the Mayor! The Scene closes. Scene VI.—A Chamber in the Mansion House. Puck, as The Lord Mayor reclining on an ottoman. Enter Sir Peter Prolix and Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric. Sir P. Hark! how quickly can repose Make a bassoon of a Lord Mayor's nose! Song, Sir Peter Prolix. Shake! O shake off Somnus' power, Wake! and break from your feather-bed bower, Dream no more of puddings and pies, Shut your mouth, and open your eyes, And lend us your ears for an hour! Pumpkin. Never big-wigs, box'd in banco, Never Panza (sharp-set Sancho!) When the doctor talismanic Put him in a hungry panic, More unjolly look'd than Jupiter, Bending his black brow on you, Peter! Lord M. Knight of Bow-Bells! beware— Pumpkin Plethoric! take care, And look how, like Hook, you hoax London's Lord Mayor! Song. Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric. A plague o' your Lordship! why make such a pother? Worshipful Mayors, and aldermen too, To waddle and toddle from one feast to t'other Is all they are good for, and all they've to do! Fresh from a cruise, We bring you rare news Well worth a Jew's eye, by Jingo! a Jew's. Mirabile dictu, Ha! ha! we have trick'd you— Sir Peter and I are the boys for a ruse! Sir P. This morning, while some crowing cock Was vocalising seven o'clock, (Chanticleer's an early riser!) Pumpkin Plethoric and I, Sir, Business of importance brewing, Closeted, were up and doing. Plans completed to perfection, Confab over and refection, Soon our fiery coursers, lash'd By a liveried Phaeton, dash'd Without a trip, or tumble down Full gallop to fair Windsor town! Bells loud bob and triple-majors, Recognising two old stagers! Rang from every tower and steeple, We were such important people! The flag upon the Castle's summit Waved a welcome, every drum it Roll'd, the guns all prittled, prattled, And the cannons roar'd and rattled As we march'd thro' towers embattled! Lord M. What provoked, Sir Peter Prolix, These your locomotive frolics? Sir P. My revered and royal Mistress I, to greet, had sported this dress; (Claret-color'd coat and kerseys, For my humble homage hers is!) Girded sword on, mounted buckles, Frill'd and flounced my neck and knuckles— Yes, for her my occiput In these flowing locks I put; (The Statue that enchants the world Boasts not a cranium better curl'd!) But (I in the deep Atlantic Wish'd the Showman and his Antic!) Barnum, that Janitor jocose To give the blue devils a dose! Lord M. Quickly to the question come. Sir P. Had got the start of us, and Thumb! Still a Lord the task of list'ning Undertook, to him the christ'ning I, with a respectful air, Introduced, and then my prayer That Her Majesty our Jubilee Would appoint a day to view Billy! Lord M. In the land of Cakes (a country Where the Doctor saw not one tree! But where dropp'd in golden showers Choice perfumery, by the powers! As thro' reeking wynds and closes He and Bozzy held their noses! Vowing that the fair Edina Out of all scents took the shine, ah!) To Lion's skin, his coat of mail, Red Sawney hangs the fox's tail! Hence, for you that fragrant land Has labell'd in her large round hand! City Solomon and Solon, My Lord Mayor a march you've stole on, You have improvised the prologue, Leaving him to go the whole hog, And to you and your abettor He remains a Rowland debtor! First, to a head that holds a brain I shall commit the mise en scene, Which must outshine the Pageants, yes, Of London to imperial Bess, When upon a city Progress Hither came the sceptred ogress! Then our mouth-piece the Recorder, Cudgelling his brains to order! Shall of putting make a point The nose of Cicero out of joint! For the Abbot of Unreason, None but you my eye, Sir P's, on; You shall make us merry with Marrowy morsels full of pith; Nothing better than a high jest Makes a hearty dinner di-gest When of city lords and ladies There a monstrous grand parade is! To His Majesty the Mayor, Pumpkin, you shall be purveyor! Put petitions in our churches For the turtle bound to Birch's! Let your banquet, not a comical Solecism gastronomical! In variety surpass All that was ever writ in Glasse! See that Bacchus pours in plenty Nectar for the cognoscenti, Supernaculum in sooth, Clear as crystal, strong as truth! Potato-brandy, log-wood-port Are only for the middling sort, Common-council men committees Who think the best wine is the City's! And in the gourmandising race Give naught the go-by but the grace! I'll have the Guys of every Guild In the art and mystery drill'd Of etiquette, that courtly screen Betwixt a Quorum and a Queen! Let Corporation Madam mind She leaves her city airs behind, (For those city airs and graces Easter Ball the proper place is!) Else will Royalty cry “These are Very cockneyfied and bi-zarre!” In prose or rhyme old Father Time I'll leave to tell the tale sublime How Magnus, mid his brethren all, Look'd like among the prophets Saul! How with rare majesty and grace He march'd behind the sword and mace, And Queen, Prince, Court, and all surprised With what his wit extemporised! Our feast and show shall comme il faut Be—now good b'ye, Sirs, bon repos! [Exit. Pumpkin. Miracles will never cease, Foxes shall be turn'd to geese! Quakers dance, that formal folk! a Clumsy reel or ponderous polka! You, who give the thorogonimble To poor rogues that rig the thimble! Frighten petty knaves in grain With the rattling of your chain! Dole them a collation hybrid, Between pump-water and dry bread! Luncheon lachrymose and lenten, Fit and proper to repent on! You, so famed for deeds of arms At Chalk and sundry other farms! Doing, with the City Light Horse, Warlike wonders on your white horse! You, Sir Peter, I'll be shot But I'm ashamed, if you are not! To let him look and talk us down, A fico for his cockney crown! And not, Od's Triggers! tickle him! Sir P. Toot! 'Twill be (daylight's coming soon) Better policy to shoot Not the Mayor—but the Moon! [Exeunt. Scene VII.—London Bridge. Enter Democritus. Democritus. Tricksy spirit! moonlight fay! Melting in the mist away, Flitting by me, hovering nigh me, Wherefore, frolic phantom! fly me? If thou art a courteous sprite Keep me company to-night, While the stars above us shine Mingle sweet discourse with mine; Merry 'tis when rides her noon Spirits meet beneath the moon! Puck. Ho! ho! ho! Dem. That voice I know— (Puck appears.) Robin's form, and Robin's crow! Special mischief I'll be bound Brings thee, Puck, from fairy ground. Truant! what a contrast this To thy balmy bowers of bliss! Thine the fragrant breath of Flora Offering incense to Aurora; Mine a reeking fume, alas! Of impurity and gas; Thine the woodland's velvet green; Crooked are my ways, unclean, Not thro' leafy groves and valleys, But long lanes and dark blind alleys! In thy fairy home and free, Thine the gurgling melody Of the rivulet, as along It ripples, and the joyous song To pastoral pipe that shepherds sing Coming forth to meet the spring! With a serenade of sadness, Shouts of hollow mirth, and madness, Of houseless wretches the shrill cry Shivering beneath a wintry sky, And wet with icy dews distill'd By the cold moon, my ear is fill'd— Mournful music! with affright Startling the silence of the night! Say, are Oberon, Titania, Bitten with thy rambling mania? Puck. Beneath the ancient forest-tree That sweetly-flowing Avon's Swan Set his glorious mark upon, While the Regent of the night Bathed the heavens in liquid light, To fairy measures, on the green, From magic lutes and harps unseen, I left them tripping merrily! In whatever shape appear Spirits from their shadowy sphere They, with cunning speech and guise, Cannot cheat my ears and eyes. Not of swash-buckler the swagger Wedded to a wooden dagger, Nor, to boot, that motley suit With the Fool's regalia to't, Nor the speech so gravely spoken Puck, ho! ho! can play a joke on! Spirit! erst of the Acropolis, Of Minerva the Metropolis! Who in marriage bonds allied Wit, and wisdom heavenly bride! Jests right jocund quaintly brought From the solemn depths of thought, And made philosophic lips Redolent of cranks and quips! Spirit, erst of that fair land Where beauty, terror, hand in hand, Breathe the sublime on Tempe's vale, And honey-crowned Hymettus, hail! If, as I expect, thy visit To our city is to quiz it, A raree-show to be rehearsed Shall soon provoke thy merriest burst. As a prologue to the laughter In good store for thee hereafter, Puck, the organ-grinding ghost, Puck, the jockey driving post, Drove, but now, two London cits Nearly out of their small wits! Never wights were, to the letter, Taken in, and shaken better! By a dismal, diabolic Diapason given the cholic— O, for such another frolic! Her mute vigils darkness keeps, All this mighty city sleeps, Save, where on the bed of anguish, Sickness, sorrow, lie and languish, On the fiery wheels of pain Travelling home to dust again! Or to heaven the secret prayer Pleads, and finds acceptance there, Or a brother's purse and life Tempt the prowling felon's knife! Not this broad majestic stream With a moan the silence mars, Reflecting the moon's silver beam, Refulgent with ten thousand stars! It rushes onward to the sea, Like time into eternity! Trophied domes and clustering spires, Storied windows, stately halls, Altars worthy of the fires Of faith and freedom! darkness palls; In the beautiful serene They are shadows dimly seen. Not a footstep! not a breath! Nothing walks abroad—but Death! Hark! those deep and solemn chimes, Every tongue is still—but Time's! Motley, would'st thou hear and see What midnight's made of? Here's the Key! Tho' I cannot, like the imp, That lame devil with the limp! Unroof first and second floor, I can open every door; Show thee whatsoe'er appears Fit for laughter, and for tears; What, for pleasure and surprise, On the glittering surface lies; What beneath a lurid light Shadows to the shuddering sight; Every secret, every sin That darkness hides and bolt bars in! Follow, and with step as light As becomes the vagrant sprite On his rambles for the night! [Exeunt. Scene VIII.—Glutton's Hall. Alderman Calipash, recumbent. Enter Puck and Democritus. Puck. There reclines, but not reposes, Repletion on his bed of roses! His short breath how hard it labors, Harder than his poorest neighbour's! Ald. (in his sleep). Encore! encore! fresh bumpers pour! Mr. Deputy, one cheer more! Dem. Hark! the tempest speaks aloud, Its voice is in the thunder-cloud! Around its path blue lightnings play With fearful radiance! (Three Spirits appear.) Who are they Whose glassy eyes with horror glare Upon that restless sleeper there? Tell me, thou mysterious fay! Puck. Famine, Sickness and Despair! Famine. To my faint and feeble cry What hath been thy rude reply? “Depart! and” (darkly frowning) “Die!” Sickness. When my palsied, feverish frame To thy pity urged my claim, What thy harsh response? The same! Despair. When my haggard sisters twain Into fury lash'd my brain, What thy antidote? The Chain! Spirits. Crush thy fellow, he shall turn— Bruise his spirit, it shall burn— If his blessing reach the skies, His curse hath wings as swift to rise! Sickness. Prosperity is not the school To mend the heart, blind Fortune's fool! The robe of Charity the storm Stripp'd not from the gracious form That meekly wore it, in the ray Of pleasant sunshine's cast away! Gold within the furnace tried From the flame comes forth refined; If adversity betide It shall purify the mind; Teaching, by its stern appeal, Hearts of adamant to feel! Some, when only skies are clear, See of love the heavenly form; Dwellers in a darker sphere, We behold it in the storm! Hath His face the Father hidden? We have borne as He hath bidden; Sorely tried and sorely chidden, In His holy sight are we One iota less than thee? What art thou that He should shower Superfluity and power? They are but a sacred trust, Items for thy reckoning hour! This thy trial, and, proud dust! Which shall, at the trumpet's sound, Thou, or we be wanting found? [The Spirits vanish. Dem. See, a mist is gathering round us, Some new potent spell has bound us! Puck. One of that unhappy number Whom despair will not let slumber, For a deed of darkness done Dies ere sets to-morrow's sun! Bolts and bars may not withstand Fairy key in fairy hand. The Scene changes to a Prison, the Gaoler, the Chaplain and the Poacher discovered. Chap. Thou hast bound him in his chain, And the law approves thy zeal, Having its sad wages ta'en, Fast to fetter, not to feel! To thy pillow, I will share This hard pallet with despair. Tho' I cannot hope to heal, Haply I may soothe the smart With a tender, calm appeal To his bleeding, broken heart! Hush the tempest of the mind, Heavenly truth shall entrance find! Doth our cottage need repair, We select some season fair, Not unroof it to the high And whistling winds and wintry sky! For the erring heart's reform Choose the sunshine, not the storm! Puck. Prisons, hark! like holy spires, Entertain celestial choirs. Anthem. Heavenly Father! heavenly Friend! O, vouchsafe Thy Presence! send Pardon, peace—and let the morn Rise on a Spirit newly born! Lively Faith appear in power, Hope illumine this dark hour! Weeping Penitence atone, And Mercy make the work thy own. Dem. Sad inheritance! thine was made Thy Parents' guilt, and thou hast paid (Foredoom'd, forsaken, and forlorn!) The penalty of being born. Puck. In the valley passing thro' Mists make dim the traveller's view, Tree or tower or rising ground The far-distant prospect bound. But if he the mountain climb Then the landscape grows sublime! All its beauteous objects meet In fair order at his feet! Thus if the soul divinely soar, This mortal film obscures no more; Thro' the bright portals of the sky A glorious future meets the eye! Yet, as the eagle's loftiest flight Alone can reach the Alpine height, All others of the feather'd race But fluttering round its awful base! The spirit of a purer fire, Of aspirations holier, higher, Can only, tho' but faintly, scan The wondrous ways of God to man! Justice holds the scales of heaven, And that thou this truth may'st see Undefiled with earthly leaven, Again I turn my magic Key! (The Scene changes to the Chamber of Death.) Dem. What means this sepulchral gloom, And that white-robed seraph bending O'er a form with beauty blending Death's mute eloquence? on her lips Life lingers, and her cheek has bloom. Happy Spirit! she would seem Passing, in a heavenly dream, From this eclipse! Puck. On a night of storms, from far Never pilot polar star More intently watch'd, than she A gallant bark that o'er the deep (The winds and waves were hush'd to sleep!) Rode in silent majesty! The declining lamp of day Dipp'd in western clouds his ray, And beneath the waters roll'd A vast sea of living gold! In heaven's blue concave rose serene The full-orb'd moon—still, still intent On that far point her eyes she bent Round which the stately vessel steer'd, A shadowy speck! then disappear'd. And not till darkly changed the scene, And deepest gloom and blackest night Shut ocean from her aching sight, Did she, pensive, leave the shore, In dreams to hear loud tempests roar, And see wild waves ingulph the wreck! —That gallant bark return'd no more! Time it was her heart should break. One lost, loved one on his pillow Sleeps beneath the angry billow! The Seraph's Song. Trial is over, and triumph is thine, In vain hath the grave for the victory striven; See yonder bright star thro' death's dark valley shine, A lamp to thy path that shall light thee to heaven. How beauteous this holy tranquillity deep! Not a charm from thy brow the Destroyer hath driven; So sweetly they smile and so calmly they sleep Whose ransom is paid and whose sins are forgiven! Puck. As the dew before the day The mournful vision melts away! Darkness, silence, sisters twin, Their deep caves retire within. The cold, grey light of morning steals, The world once more will be on wheels! To the universal scramble All will take their daily amble! All, save one—Repletion's Son— His inglorious race is run! Dreaming of his midnight orgies, Gloating, glutton! o'er his gorges, With a strong convulsive heave His harsh, selfish soul took leave! Sable plumes and velvet pall, Mutes and mourners, hirelings all! In funeral pride shall slowly ride, But where will be the heavenly guide? (The Scene changes to Windsor Forest.) What a landscape smiles around! Looks it not enchanted ground? Happy homestead, fruitful soil Paying back the peasant's toil! Cheerful hamlet, playful steeds, Flocks and herds in flowery meads Disporting, and the hound the hare Pursuing to its secret lair! Welcome Windsor's proud alcoves, Forest, woodlands, glades and groves! Winding river, on whose bright Calm, clear bosom lives in light The mirror'd landscape! by whose stream Sits musing on some thoughtful theme The pensive angler! classic shore, The Muses' favourite haunts of yore, And still where pure ennobling thought Is to the young aspirant taught! Stern-brow'd Castle! dauntless! hoar! In feudal grandeur that has frown'd For ages! and with memories crown'd Awe-inspiring and profound! Welcome yon bright orb! behold He tips its antique towers with gold! Minaret and village spire Glow with his celestial fire! Temples for divinest duty, Types of holiness and beauty, Uprising in the solar ray, Like pinnacles of flame are they! Welcome too the babbling hum Of busy men! the distant drum The trumpet answering! and of morn The merry bells! the huntsman's horn Thro' the hills and vales resounding! And the stag majestic bounding! And of birds the tuneful voices; Nature smiles and man rejoices, Earth is paradise to view, Heaven one deep unclouded blue, A vast scroll serenely bright Writ in characters of light! As morning's bright and orient dews That gem the flowers, reflect their hues, From each scene my spirit borrows Something of its joys and sorrows! Thus, oft-times, to temper folly, Come will pensive melancholy, Re-enthroning in their shrine Golden thoughts and themes divine, Which, unto the wise and good, Make a heaven of solitude! Part we, till another greeting Welcome in a merrier meeting. [Exeunt. Scene XII.—Mercer's Hall. The Master of the Mercer's Company, and the New Royal Exchange Committee at their dessert and wine. Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric in the Chair. Song, Mr. Pumpkin Plethoric. Jolly Queen Bess had an appetite stout, Her Majesty too was a great diner-out, The court and the city, the country and town Found it no joke entertaining the Crown! With Robin, “sweet Robin!” and Burghley and Bacon Her mutton the Queen had alternately taken; And fearing the cits might with jealousy burn, She promised to give Thomas Gresham a turn! A merchant was he of princely degree, With gold in his coffers and ships on the sea, So, gamesome and gay, on a Michaelmas day She rode, with his good things old gooseberry to play! Her silk (the fine girl's!) was powder'd with pearls, And crown'd was her wig, with its carroty curls! Her fan was of feathers, her collar of gold; She sparkled like Sheba's proud sovereign of old! Her ruff was of lace, and as to her face, Time had made very free with Her Majesty's Grace! Her teeth had fall'n out and her cheeks had fall'n in While bringing together her nose and her chin! As Bow's merry bell hailed the pious Pucelle, Deep toll'd in her ear Mary's last dying knell! Her pulse it beat quick and her heart it grew sick, And Essex, her pet, in his neck felt a crick! The halt and the blind, the crooked inclined, All who a hump had before or behind, Were put out of sight lest Her Majesty might Than her own royal self see a still greater fright! Bareheaded and cropp'd, Sir Thomas he dropp'd On his dutiful knees when the cavalcade stopp'd, Sir Walter his gown for a carpet threw down, Her Grace gave a smile and her Favorite a frown! The banquet was rare with the choicest of fare, The fish of the sea and the fowls of the air; Old English Roast Beef was a lion let loose, But the lion of all was a Michaelmas Goose! In spring it had been a gosling and green, But autumn had fatten'd it up for the Queen! 'Twas barley and barm from Sir Thomas's farm, Stuff'd to a miracle! done to a charm! Quoth the Queen, “Cock and Pie! we'll a merrythought try—” Next off-hopp'd a leg, then two wings took a fly! And she swore in plain prose the episcopal nose Her banquet should bring to an orthodox close! In the silver tureen was no apple-sauce seen, And the ghost of the Goose look'd aghast at the Queen! Then after a toast, just to keep down the roast! Her Grace thus proclaim'd to her citizen host. “Now hear our command! at the feast of St. Michae! Let true loving lieges henceforth do the like all; In memory of this, be their banquet for aye A Royal Roast Goose upon Michaelmas day!” Master. Let each member take his heeltap— Now a sparkling bottle we'll tap! Charge—the Chair! for festive gaiety Quite a pattern to the laity! Not forgetting—hip!—(sub rosa) Placens uxor! cara sposa. Pumpkin. Citizens! your art and mystery (Never root or branch of this tree May reforming hatchet sever, Live to eat and drink for ever! And be never your digestive Organs out of order, restive!) Chiefly lies in making cheer For yourselves throughout the year, And passing round the “loving cup,” An art to which you all are up! No important motion passes At this board o'er empty glasses; Legislation (hang your drops!) Always with the bottle stops; Little doubt a bumper bright Puts things in the clearest light, Hence, half measures you decline Both in politics and wine. Bacchanalians, in your glory, You need no memento mori To croak “Alas! all flesh is grass, So boys the bottle briskly pass!” You are not the men, in sooth, In a well to fish for truth, When (in vino veritas) You have got it in your glass! Above Roman fame and Grecian Is your banquet for repletion. How would Kitchiner his eyes up Turn with rapture, could he rise up! Turtle (every present man, Sir, Has for three good pints to answer, Percolating thro' his system, How the deuce could he resist 'em?) More decidedly delicious Never palated Apicius! Of your punch, that prime liqueur! Bacchus must have been the brewer, 'Twould make a gentleman, I swear, Masticate son propre père! In your sherry, pale and brown, A Duke might be content to drown! Visitors would very far go Ere they match'd your château margaux! Your Rudesheimer (luscious tears That flow'd for Charlemagne and his peers! The nectar of a thousand years!) Exquisitely soft and sunny, Rivals Hybla for its honey! Your port has got the beeswing in't, Your champagne the true opal tint, Your hock, bright, mellow! tells the tun From which it rippled was A 1! That such feast should have a finis, Mercers, your lament and mine is! Old Simposiarchs! with brevity, Health I wish you and longevity; Wit and wine, when ruled by reason, Never can be out of season; To the which (not Bacchi plenus!) Martin Luther buckles Venus. Socrates, of sages veriest, Was of merry men the merriest; Judged by his facetious prose if, What a wag was Miller Joseph! To gladden every mother's son And give a fillip to our fun, That it flow a little faster, Something comic from the Master! Song, The Master. Three Tooley Street Tailors presuming, pretending The State, like an old pair of breeks, wanted mending, At the “Thimble and Shears” (three cross-legged seers!) Drew up this address from the plebs to the peers. We, the people of England! (three Tailors!) imprimis, Proclaim for equality now come the time is, Like Citizen Phil and his brave sans culottes, We mean to take measures for cutting your throats! Our will shall be law, and our sovereign the people, A king's but a crown, and a church but a steeple! And when not a stone stands of altar and throne, What's yours shall be mine, Sirs, and what's mine, my own! The King and the Queen peeping thro' shall be seen Our “national window,” a French guillotine! At every lamp-post when We rule the roast, Shall some proud aristocrat give up the ghost!” They bid mine host bring 'em (three Tailors from Tooley!) A bowl of hot punch, which he did—the more fool he!— In riot and rumpus these radical railers Grew out of all compass—three Tooley Street Tailors! Quoth Boniface, “Pardon! I keep no Bear Garden.” The Liberty Boys roar'd “Ve don't care a farden! Cut and come again now is the popular strain.” Cried mine host “You shall cut, but you sha'n't come again! “Three Tailors are not worth powder and shot, But when you thrice three shall together have got I'll first, nothing loth, tackle one of you, troth, Then run and fetch nine more, and I'll baste you both.” They prudently beat a rapid retreat These terrified Tailors, as white as a sheet! Sing God save King George and his soldiers and sailors, And shout three times three for three Tooley Street Tailors! Enter a Beadle with letters. Pumpkin. More addresses, more additions, It rains, it pours, it hails petitions Crying, like so many crickets, “Tickets for the Pageant! Tickets!” Simkins Seth of Savage Gardens, (Begging me ten thousand pardons!) Timkins (“Yours most truly!”) Grigsby, (Can't he quiet selling figs be?) “Your devoted servant,” Diggins, And (the foul fiend fetch 'em!) Figgins, Higgins, Spriggins, Wiggins, with Smuggs, and the everlasting Smith! In these polite epistles keep Ringing the changes for a peep! Every city son of Adam, Every Corporation Madam, Jew and Gentile, parson, layman, Parish clerk that snuffles “Amen!” Infidel and true believer All have got this ticket fever! Enter Puck. Puck. Of the human face divine Up the staircase what a line! In the corridor and lobbies, On the very scent that Rob is! Mr. Chairman, for a ticket, I've contrived to thread the thicket. Puck's my name, and Miching Mallecho, Which, (as classics less than calico You affect, and more the loom Than learning) I inform the room Means merry mischief in full bloom! Never, of all sorts and sizes, Proteus put on more disguises Took so many forms and faces, Play'd so many airs and graces! Tom-of-all-trades! I am he, Nothing comes amiss to me; If it be successful knavery The effluvia's not unsavoury, Rather like a bunch of roses It to my commercial nose is! But a fetid fume the affair has When 'tis wound up with a “Whereas!” Special specs I have for sale On the river, on the rail! Steam, to send up shares, and after Them the steamer, rib and rafter! Bond, for a financial fudge meant, Bought without, but bringing, judgment! Line, whose terminus should be (For Directors!) Tyburn-Tree! Daily puff I from my rostrum Pill infallible and nostrum; Sinners in a piteous panic Touching certain tours satanic, (Gluttons, hypocrites and misers Wonder not they dread to die, Sirs! Crossing Styx to the attorney Is a very awful journey!) Millionaires, who worlds would give Over again their lives to live, (Length of days could riches buy, Nobody but the poor would die!) Saints, to creature comforts given, Very shy of going to heaven! Who rather in this vale of tears Would weep away a few more years, From dark trips and beatific Respite seek in my specific! Ills that flesh is heir to fly me, Influenza come and try me! Gout, dyspepsia, asthma, ague, And blue devils, don't I plague you? Locks of gray I turn to golden, Make a young face out of an olden, Change eyes, noses, and what various Carious teeth for teeth vicarious! For teeth, as they are done by, do; First you cut them, then they cut you. Puck from Windsor to St. James's With the court to travel claims his Right and title, hence (the fame's his!) Pranks at Windsor Castle, Buckin'ham Palace have a spice of Puck in 'em! There am I, And the courtiers cry (The maids of Honor tittering by!) “My Lord of Misrule Is playing the Fool, Trying a trick On the silver stick, Running his rigs On the ermine and wigs, Quizzing the reverend aprons all, And poking his fun at the sceptre and ball!” Me a Merry-Andrew you may See at fancy “Bal Costumé.” Figuring with fantastic groups, Antique stomachers and hoops, High-heel'd shoes and stockings roll'd, Rouge and diamonds, grease and gold! Such as a la mode were reckon'd At the court of George the Second, Which to that of Louis, Rowley, P'r'aps might be accounted holy! The ballet stopp'd, the curtain dropp'd, For midnight come, no hop is hopp'd, That Sovereign, subject, figurante may, Good christians! all go home to pray, And holy keep the Sabbath day! Having souls, the which have most men But the Queen's poor penny-postmen! I gossip in the sacred (!) dawn At Lady Spree's “réunion” yawn, (Mon ami Lady Spree, Very brassy! very passé Longing still to look a lassie Worthy that adust Adonis Who the Darby to her Joan is!) Rank and fashion flocking thither For a little small-talk with her! The Queen's command to dance or dinner Wakens prompt obedience in her, But the command of Heaven's High King Is a very different thing! I, hey presto! Whig or Tory, Turn my coat and twist my story— Give me but the loaves and fishes, Bribery a savory dish is! Send me to the right about, Then I strut reformer stout! In the Liberal's masquerade, (Tartan trousers and a plaid!) Kidnap freedom—heavenly maid! Great cry and little wool, Poor Europa and the Bull! In my meeting-going guise, Turning up the whites of my eyes Like William Penn (Mov-ed by the Spurrit!) when With his Brummagem nick-nacks He bamboozled the poor blacks (Cunning Quaker!) Out of many, many an acre; Giving for their title deeds Little bits of glass, and beads!— In my meeting-going guise, Turning up the whites of my eyes Like our fat friend When he William Penn out-Penn'd, From behind his double chin Took the Taunton lasses in, Robb'd them of a pretty handsome Sum, the rogue! by way of ransom! Preach'd (papistically zealous) Perjury to the Oxford Fellows! At Exeter Hall I open the ball, With (simpering, whimpering!) “Gentle folks all, You that have tears prepare to spout— Pocket-handkerchiefs out!— British slaves need no compassion, Starved, and toiling early, late; Black's the color now in fashion, White has long been out of date!” Does the crown to Windsor town Command a Thespian cart-load down Manager Puck (to heighten the joke!) Dons Lord Hamlet's inky cloak, And has a trial with the Ghost Which can make ugly faces most! Which can grin a tragic passion In the best horse-collar fashion! “Box and Cox” sets hardly more The Room of Rubens in a roar! Having from my client Cain His last pilfer'd penny ta'en, I burnish up my brazen face, For fear it blush, unlikely case! In falsehood rank redip my tongue, Lest it slip, tho' glibly hung! Season my Old Bailey bathos With a dash of Liston's pathos, Screw up my forensic fury, Drop a tear to judge and jury! When old Dives every ingot By his sad besetting sin got, Hoping for a clear acquittal! Gives to build a church or spital, (His last trick to cheat Old Nick! The worms he leaves but bones to pick!) I, while Hades rings with laughter! Guide his pen and shrive him after, Follow him as far as Styx In a mourning coach and six! Cut in monumental stone His repulsive skin and bone! And scrawl his hearse with venal verse, Which makes the matter ten times worse! Business bad, I mount my pad, And gallop the country round like mad! Rat-tat! open sesame! Who's that? Jemmy Jessamy! Come to look into every nook, And by hook or by crook to hash up a book! An Olla-pod—anecdotes odd Of poor poets under the sod. Having got, to boil the pot, Of slip-slop gossip a lumping lot, I pack up my pack, harness my hack, Whip and spur with my budget back, Then hey for “Homes and Haunts” in a crack! Lyre in limbo, in my grief Ogling visionary beef! For a mug of mum and chops I'll distil you honey drops! Old Sylvanus, in his dotage, Grudging my poor pint of pottage, (Which the not too-liberal soul Does to his dunces daily dole, Where, hot and thin! ne'er enters in Of solid beef the sinewy shin, But which well-diluted diet Keeps them lean and keen and quiet, And their wits from running riot!) Economically cruel, Doses me with hungry gruel! Which detestable decoction Puts me up again to auction! Who bids highest, and my body Takes the quickest out of quod he Shall among my lions sit In the full-dress box of wit! Catch a sparrow, salt his tail! Catch a critic like a whale! Th' outward man may not surrender, 'Tis the inward one that's tender! The Tub's Tenant for an honest Man sought Athens—But he non est! With his lantern here in London Would his work be sooner done, done? When, for speculation, sport, I visit Mark Lane, Capel Court, Me to choose a pin it poses 'Twixt Corn, Consols—Pure, and Moses! When Greek meets Greek then comes the tug Of war—a proper Cornish hug! When benighted Scot his brother Each contrives to cheat the other! When Jew meets Quaker 'Tis “pull Devil! pull Baker!” If you love to hear and see cant— (My last ruse, Sirs, is to re-cant, Solemn vows to break and barter To be written down a martyr! Petted, as apostate knave is, Shown up for a rara avis, “More like,” cry knowing ones, nem. con., “A sheep in sables than a swan!”) If you love to hear and see cant Of the newest fashion—the cant, (Lazy latitude and low church, Non conformity and no church Are to me all A. B. C., To each conundrum I've the key!) From the platform, from the pulpit Come and hear me to a full pit (I've a rubric and a ritual, Friends fanatical, to fit you all!) Bully every art and science, Bid 'em, in a fury, fly hence! Ranting, and with relish relate How I, in my zany zeal, hate Steeple-houses, priest and prelate! Down with painted altars! oriel Windows, popish and pictorial! Kick out liturgies and creeds, (Pitchers crack'd and broken reeds!) Preaching good and holy deeds. Off with surplice! Romish raiment, Not for this reforming day meant! Carnal cloth! unlovely linen! Not to swaddle saint, but sin in! Now and then his vicar, sub, Me doth an archbishop dub, Then, ho! ho! Puck and Co. Three grim Doctors all of a-row! Præmunire, in terrorem, Grinning like a ghoul before 'em! (Præmunire! Præmunire! Of true faith the trial fiery! Written down in Harry's diary!) Play their solemn farce at Bow. Is the good Archbishop shock'd? Doth he deem God's temple mock'd? Is his courage primed and cock'd For resistance holy? lock'd He shall be in prison! dock'd Of his dignities—unfrock'd! When (of law a slippery limb!) My credit will no longer swim, All the better at my tail if Dangle doxy and a bailiff! My ragged fortune to repair Reformer furious up I flare, Expectorate my Billingsgate, At Common-Hall, on Church and State, City classics that the clique Better understand than Greek! With a penitential chuckle Down to Jacks in office knuckle, Dearly love they tools that truckle! Sinners whose conversion recent Makes their dotage only decent! Thus I rise, and get rewarded, Though its duty if the cord did, My last dying speech, confession, Would most aptly crown the session! What d'ye lack? what d'ye lack? Pedler Puck has 'em all in his pack! “The People's” Chit, “the People's” Chat, “The Family” This, “the Family” That, Every pun cracked under the sun Since Momus first opened his budget of fun! Plays with plots, and plays with none. Fustian tragedy, mountebank mummery, Fine-drawn, filigree, flatulent flummery, Histories, mysteries, sentiment, smut, The froth of the beer, and the dregs of the butt! French (by the stench!) from the sewer of Sue— Knowledge is, nowadays, (who'll buy? who?) As cheap as dirt, as plentiful too, And awfully like it in hogo and hue! What d'ye lack? what d'ye lack? Intellect's brass with a fine gilt back? Pedler Puck has 'em all in his pack. In my sacerdotal smalls, Clerical coat, canonical castor, A portly pillar of St. Paul's, A rector plump, a rosy master, Roll'd into one, I bask in the sun! Tinted by Italian skies Glowing cheeks, bright laughing eyes, Lips, that archly curling, show Of fair teeth an ivory row, Caper comic to a spinet With more mirth than music in it! Song that makes its sad appeal To the few with hearts to feel, You have seen and heard implore Liberal largess at your door. Oft that Puck was Troubadour Shall this chanson make you sure. Ballad. Where majestic mountains rise To the blue unclouded skies, And in sunny vales below All the flowers of Eden blow; Where, to music, dance and song, Every streamlet glides along, There the home is, sweet Savoy! Of the merry Minstrel Boy. I have wander'd far and wide, Many a country's bounty tried, And in freedom's happy land Found at last a fostering hand! Hearts to pity so inclined Who shall out of Britain find? Who? with gratitude and joy, Asks the merry Minstrel Boy! When critics fight, and bark and bite, In setting William Shakespeare right, Meanings, in their controversy, Making, marring without mercy! When the would-be widow's lover Sees her dying spouse recover; When, out of pique to Jerry Sneak, Death gives his wife another squeak! When the worshippers of Wesley (Does devotion in a dress lie? Is of piety the essence In a perpendicular presence? In frigidity, acidity, Querulousness in its quiddity?)— When the Janizaries of John Mysterious “Fly Sheets” light upon, Proving, if or not it please 'em, Much their stable wants the besom! When of knockers-out a knot Are outplotted in their plot; When knaves fall out, and honest men Obtain their rights, but not till then! And rogues in their own traps are caught, Robin has not roam'd for naught! He to bear his mischief brings Not on sad and sacred things. Who shall dare Arraign despair? Make direst woe A penal show? Was madness made for mockery? No! Often I, a farcing fellow! Play the pulpit Punchinello, Vapour in a gown and cassock, Dance a hornpipe on a hassock! Now and then, to tickle the town, Midas I strut in an Alderman's gown, And with my judicial ears Take my place among my peers! Clap on my cranium civic crown, “Entertaining” Toga try on, And royally roll'd In scarlet and gold, Rampantly out-roar the Lion! But would I out-Bruin the Bear— Pumpkin. This droll would make a parson swear! Mr. Mountebank— (Rising from his seat.) Puck. Mon frere! I take, by Jupiter! the Chair. (Slips into the vacant seat.) Enter Democritus as Beadle. Duet. Democritus and Puck. Dem. Punch and Jem Crow are both waiting below, As soon as you can, Sir, an answer they crave.Puck. Tell nigger Jem I've the treadmill for him! Tell Mr. Punch he's an impudent knave! Dem. Little Tom Thumb for his ticket is come.Puck. Rare sport for the court! he shall caper and spout; We'll serve, to a tittle, up Boney the Little! Boney the Great we have often served out. Dem. The Giant will thank ye for one for a Yankee.— With Strong-wind's petition I bring the Great Bear's—Puck. Bid the Ojibbeway run with his rib away! Kick the American Giant down stairs! Dem. A ticket for—Puck. Eh?Dem. Gog! another for Magog!Puck. The sooner the better each right-about wheels! My brain's like a feather, I cannot tell whether I stand, noble Grand! on my head or my heels. The Scene closes. Scene XIII.—A Tavern. Timothy Truckle and Jacob Juniper discovered. Timothy. To-morrow, when from Titan's bed Aurora rises blushing red! When, after snuffing out the moon, The Sun Dan Phœbus rides his noon; Jacob, when our Bow-bells chime The pleasant tune of pudding-time To your daughters Dolly, Dinah, Then proclaim we that Regina, With her court and consort, (listen!) This bran new Exchange will christen (Brick-and-mortary salmagundi!) On the next ensuing Monday. Pearson, mad wag! Merewether, Laying their wise wigs together! Have concocted martial law To keep the citizens in awe! I their Corporation thunder Pump, and you, the beadle under, Must, with all submission due, From me, first fiddle! take your cue. While this Pageant's on the stage Every cockney in his cage Shall, like the imprison'd starling, shout “I can't get out! I can't get out!” Jacob. Tim, my farthing rushlight dimmer In your sun can only glimmer, Seeing you imbibed at school Grammar just like gooseberry-fool! Long divisions and subtractions, Airs polite and vulgar fractions. My palavering pedagogue he “Preachee” did, but never “floggee!” (Birch for blockheads had than blarney Better been, that yawning yarn he Spun the school-boys, cant and carney!) Hence I took to British stingos Rather than to foreign lingos, And could never join or jump With social parties round a pump! Such experiments hydraulic Savouring cruelly of cholic, To teetotallers and twanky I said “Gentlefolks, no thank'e!” I remember you a clerk Shuffling after Shadrack Shark That walking gibbet of a man Whom never bankrupt bard outran! Deeming a dramatic stroller More delectable, and droller, You dodged about the playhouse doors, Then danced a devil on all fours! How gaped the gallery gods and grinn'd To see you frisk, you funny fiend! Filch to figure in at Fairlop You from four legs did a pair lop! At St. Bartlemy and Barnet You were comedy incarnate! Up and down the country strolling (In the interval of drolling), Yeovil, Yoxford, Yackum, Yarmouth Heard you, as a tragic star, mouth! Like in an ivy-bush an owl, You scowl'd the true Macready scowl, And shaved your beard with water cold Because John Kemble did of old! Having join'd a gipsy throng, (Meals were short and miles were long!) You with geese for playing fox Took a benefit in the stocks! Once again in London town, In the mouth extremely down! (At Covent Garden rogues in grain The Elephant at Drury Lane, Brompton's, and St. Bartle's players, Gooseberry and Greenwich fairs All at their last kick and pray'rs!) In what theatre could you Frisk on four legs or on two? Wizard of the Norwood breed, Merry-Andrew run to seed, Bankrupt ward of capering Bruins, Sometime rope-dancer in ruins, Barn-door bantam on the scout, Salamander quite burnt out, Parcel-poet, not plethoric! You were now, “Alas, poor Yorick!' Settled, sold up, ruin'd, roll'd up, Never more your head to hold up? No such thing, Tim, no such thing, Your bow had still another string! Thro' your vocal nose, and thorax You held forth like many more hacks, And your bray the brainless “brethren” Suck'd thro' their long ears of leather in! Puzzling dogmas by the score You but set on foot, to floor! As the skittles-playing clown Puts them up to knock them down! Soon expanding to a “Deacon,” Cant you grew quite smug and sleek on, Sang devoutly, sigh'd demurely, Slumber'd in your pew securely, Nodding your sympathizing head, To every thing the parson said! In your Muggletonian face Gravity was sign of grace, Did you laugh, I do believe, It was only in your sleeve! From all corners of your eyes Ogling for the richest prize, Every widow, every maid In the balances you weigh'd Under as they pass'd in rows Your prognosticating nose! When, behold! a “serious” maiden Full of love, with lucre laden, (Brother Snuffle, who intruded Popp'd the question not as you did!) Of conventicles the cream, Got up your connubial steam! Tim. Jacob, when your weaker vessel's Laid upon a pair of trestles, And you've grunted all your grief out Take my book and tear a leaf out! Let those (luck's logic!) laugh that win, Somebody must be taken in, Cries my easy conscience, which is Very like a Dutchman's breeches, Plenty large enough, and roomy, Quite indeed a treasure to me! O'er the sick, with solemn face, The dismal doctor grumbles grace, Not forgetting, sly old fox! Blessings on Pandora's box. The attorney ne'er, rely on't, Makes two mouthfuls of a client, Any more than school-boy merry Makes two nibbles of a cherry! Alas! how many curates lean It takes to dine one rosy dean, And how many deans to dish up Banquet bilious for a bishop! Chuckling o'er his sinecure may You the gourmand see, and gourmet, In satiety and sloth Living on the public both! Not, a burning shame! to mention The state pauper with a pension, Or in petticoat or breech A rare lickspit and a leech! The scale descend, will matters mend Opine you at the people's end? Treading see the commonalty In the footsteps of the quality; Yes, Jacob Juniper! I feel Your toe intruding on my heel, Toe of one that two a-penny, Trims His Majesty the Many!

Tipple for an emperor!—tip!— [They fall asleep. Enter Puck and Democritus. Puck. This charm'd bowl the wits that wheedles Of these two bibacious beadles Shall, by its somnific powers, Hold them captive for twelve hours. While in a delirious trance Fantastic furies round them dance, Hobgoblins, of the bottle's birth, In ghastly shapes of madness, mirth! While reel tapers, jug and jorum In a phantom jig before 'em, These two-legged, torpid trunks of state To-morrow we will personate, Ay, and publish to the lieges London in a state of siege is! —Busy day has done its duty, Night's enthroned in awful beauty! All her lustrous lamps divine In their glittering orbits shine! From thy realm, grim king of ghosts! Mute and stealing, spectral hosts That could tell full many a tale Walk in death's mysterious veil! Oath of silence they have ta'en, Man may ask, but ask in vain What wondrous secrets lie beyond The vale of shadows! none respond To the inquirer! —Now the breeze Swells into solemn harmonies, Hark! Hosannas rise around, Every star a voice has found! All Creation, in the calm, Uplifts her high thanksgiving psalm To the Eternal Dwelling-Place, And in the darkness hides her face! Crime and gluttony and woe, The ridiculous and low Are not All this Key can show— Dem. Spirit! Puck. Follow! time flies fast, One Lock more—and That the last! [Exeunt. Scene XIV.—The Interior of Westminster Abbey. Democritus and Puck discovered.Puck. Never Temple more august Rear'd its sacred spires to heaven Where repentant, sinful dust Humbly prays to be forgiven! Light celestial streams around, And from every holy altar, With a sweet and solemn sound, Rises a mysterious psalter As thro' walks of chiefs we glide In their monumental pride; Marble effigy, and pall, Curtain dread! that drops on all. Death's thick-shaded frontier past, Kings their crowns imperial cast, Lowly pilgrims! at the gate Of this sepulchre of state. The knight who once in triumph bore The Cross of Christ to Canaan's shore His lance and panoply lays down, Assured his hope that Cross will crown! From perils of the land and wave Beneath our footsteps sleep the brave! Patriots who saw senates shake And tyrants tremble when they spake, Poets whom the lyre made glorious And o'er death and time victorious, Firm confessors whom the wheel But inspired with stronger zeal, Saints who fed the funeral pyre, Souls of faith! and lips of fire! With the martyr's glory crown'd, Sanctify this sacred ground! Mingling with their hallow'd mould Hands lie nerveless, lifeless, cold, That sculptured with enchanting grace The fairest form, the loveliest face, That in their magic tints attired What nature, fancy, faith inspired! The eye, the voice that every breath Held, in charm'd wonder, hush'd as death! Their histrionic wreath resign'd, Here, closed and silent, rest enshrined. Minstrels who the chords once swept Here the grave's dark sabbath kept, Now, with seraphim enroll'd, Hymns they chant to harps of gold! The brain enrich'd with various lore (That busy brain! it throbs no more) Sleeps beneath this marble floor! All that lifts the living clod To the image of his God, All that deifies his dust This vast temple holds in trust! These were they whom gold could never From their independence sever, Or poverty make mean, or scorn Of their nobility inborn Despoil, that star upon their brow The world to value knew not how! These were they who walk'd the earth Conscious of celestial birth, Proved that glittering dross and dust Do not every soul encrust, But that of their sacred sire Some retain the heavenly fire! Did sad tears their errors mourn While the mortal coil was borne, Seraphs might have shed them all When, alas! they wept the Fall. Vanish'd life's brief, troubled dream, Pass'd the valley, cross'd the stream, As Guardian Angels they descend, Still ministering to virtue's friend Until eternity unite Good spirits in the realms of light. Solemn grandeur! silent gloom! Handmaids of this reverend tomb, Altho' beyond of death the power, I feel this awe-inspiring hour! And thou, a Spirit too, I see It has a mystic charm for thee! Slow dies away the dirge-like hymn, The supernatural light grows dim, The shadowy shrines and cloisters seem The relics of a fading dream! The moon is down, the stars are pale, Hail! congenial darkness, hail! Primæval shade! our steps attend, Of time the origin and end! [Exeunt. Scene XV.—Guildhall. A merry Peal of Bells. Time, Noon. Enter Ballad-Singer. The Ballad-Singer's Song. What makes the merry heart more glad? Tuneful Bells! And the sorrowful more sad? Tuneful bells! What welcomes in the bridal day When with flowers they strew the way? What calls the penitent to pray? Tuneful Bells! What proclaims the feast, the show? Tuneful Bells! Joy and sorrow, weal and woe? Tuneful Bells! What salutes the smiling morn When the noble heir is born, Or some dear one has departed Makes us still more broken-hearted? Tuneful bells! Mournful music are to me Tuneful bells! Chime they e'er so merrily, Toll they knells! One recalls with startling truth Happy infancy, and youth! One, when weeping, bending lowly, I beheld earth's bosom holy Take my last friend!—pealing slowly Tuneful Bells! I shall die alone, obscurely, Tuneful Bells! And lie where the orphan poor lie, Tuneful Bells! Tho' no tomb my grave encumber, Tho' among that nameless number, I shall not less sweetly slumber, Tuneful Bells! [Exit. Enter Puck and Democritus as Beadles, followed by citizens and mob. Puck. O Yes! O Yes! O Yes! Next Saint Monday (rogues uproarious! I had need the breath of Boreas, Silence!), by my hat and cockade, We the city bar and blockade; For the show upon our borders Will be for the lower orders (Revolution's raw material!) Too imposing, too imperial. By Jupiter Ammon! None shall warble “Pickled Salmon!” Periwinkles improvise, Hot potatoes, mutton pies! None the royal ear offend With “All a-growing!” “All a-blowing!” “Knives to grind!” or “Chairs to mend!” 'Twixt Temple-Bar and Aldgate Pump, Jem Crow, you are forbid to jump! Punch, if you presume to squeak, You'll stand committed for a week, And make vocal Brixton Hill, As you migrate to the Mill! Barrel-organs be it known We've a concert of our own, Dancing Bears There's a ball at the mayor's! Dem. The Chairman and Quorum, With bumpers before 'em, From the Hall of the Mercers, their Sanctum-Sanctorum! Wishing you a merry meeting, Send this manifesto, greeting! Natty Sparks Of Bevis-Marks, Panyer Alley, Paul's Chain, Pye-Corner, Petticoat Lane, Moses, Whose poetry just on a par with his prose is! Sells a suit of any hue For (“Ready Money!”) two pounds two. “Phenomenon,” says Mr. Moses, “As plain as on my face my nose is!” And the word of Moses As good as his clothes is! Run! run! To Moses and Son, Make a leg, And a dashing suit unpeg, If on Monday, with your tickets, You expect to pass the wickets. Chubby Venuses from Cheap, Courteous dames from Candlewick, Would you qualify to peep? To your mantua-makers quick! For the foreign fashions ding 'em, (No admittance in a gingham!) Belles from Bow the changes ring 'em! Paris! Paris! All the world before it carries. [Exeunt Puck and Democritus. Grand Mob-Chorus, led by Un Marchand de Ragatons. (Grisé!) Brother Britons! hear you this? Is it not beyond a joke Such a pickled rod to kiss? Such a pill to gulp, or choke? Cut the counter! sink the shop! Beavers doff, and helmets don, Forward! Cits, shoulder spits! Aprons off, and armour on! Should a red-coat give the word, Do, as you have often done; Ere his single pop is heard, Show the blade your backs, and run! [Exeunt Mob, singing “Rule Britannia!” Manent two Citizens. 1st Cit. The Roman Chief his gods besought To fall in battle bravely fought, Not in ignominious squabble With the locust-looking rabble! “Rule Britannia!” requiem, zanies! Screech'd by you to Freedom's manes Quite enough to turn my brain is! And make my Lumber-Trooper's sword Leap from its scabbard, by the Lord! 2nd Cit. Last night's motion made, and muddled, When in their hot hall were huddled Fetter-Lane's Odd-Fellows, fuddled! And those pots and pipes nocturnal Mystify your cranium, Colonel! To your fumigated fancy Figure what no one else can see! Hence the goddess in extremis, Like your valour, but a dream is! A most comical chimera Of tobacco born and beer, ah! Why Freedom, from her firm-set rock, Laughs at my Lord's heroics mock, And for these braggadocios, bah! Has a still heartier “ha! ha! ha!” When did the goddess ever moult A feather? To the red-hot bolt From the cannon, many a time She has opposed her front sublime! Freedom! 'twas her powerful charm That warm'd the heart and nerved the arm Of Abercrombie! to its goal That impell'd the fiery soul Of Acre's hero! and that gave Nelson's signals to the brave! On Corunna's fatal shore Her sigh bewail'd the gallant Moore, And what burning tears she shed On noble Howard's crimson bed, When Ponsonby, when Picton bled! If the tears of angels flow When “Robes and furr'd gowns” play the fool, Wiser mortals here below Follow quite a different rule! If Whimsiculo the Mayor is Full of vanities, vagaries, If gross Aldermen ape grandees, Common-council-men turn dandies, There loud laugher through the land is! Worshipful Dogberries! have done, Or, faith, you'll kill the town with fun! [Exeunt. Scene XVI.—The Gardens of Buckingham Palace. Enter Minstrel. The Minstrel's Song. The fragrant incense of the morn On the freshening breeze is borne As, with sweetly-solemn sound, It scatters autumn's leaves around! The air is vocal, to the skies The merry birds, in chorus, rise,— In their concert why are mute The Minstrel's voice, his harp and lute? For once could his romantic rede ('Twas in the Olden Time indeed!) Commend itself by tuneful arts To gentle bosoms, manly hearts! The monarch oped his hall of state, The peasant, too, his cottage gate, To hear his merrie song and geste, And give him largess, food and rest! Ah! happy days—in vain I mourn— The Minstrel long has pass'd the bourne! To none descend his magic lyre, His tuneful voice and heavenly fire! Comfort cold, neglect unkind, Hearts less warm, but more refined, Hush'd his harp-strings, and for aye Their thrilling music died away! Who shall mark the sacred mound Where he sleeps his sleep profound? Traces none tradition gives, But his sweet song for ever lives! —This poor voice, these trembling wires, Lady! one fond hope inspires That sorrow never more than now May wound thy heart or cloud thy brow. [Exit. Enter Democritus in a court dress, and Puck. Dem. Now have I, the courtier's brother, Changed one Fool's coat for another! That I may presume to jostle Fashion, folly's priest, apostle! And strut a Don among the Dons Of this unblushing age of Bronze! Think you, with a little bluster, I shall pass this motley muster? Not for lack of some assurance Would I, Puck, forego endurance! Puck. Not a more vain-glorious varlet, Fluttering in his gold and scarlet, Ranks in Royalty's retinue! Every lass will wish to win you! If I catch you once Philand'ring, Such a peal I'll rattle and ring In your ears, Lothario gay! You hav'n't heard for many a day. How would Jove the cloud-compelling, Laugh while Motley's tale was telling! Flowers by gay Anacreon wreathed, Burning sighs by Sappho breathed! Wags ye all are in Elysium, Mortals mundane queerly quiz ye 'em! I, when no observer's nigh, Mark the language of the eye, Listen to the secret sigh, Hear what scandal would insinuate, Puck on which your faith to pin you hate! And then repay, with cent. per cent. Every hint so kindly meant! I, on tongue of tattling sister Seal her story with a blister! Plant a Pelion of a pimple On some dear bewitching dimple! Transfer to her nasal tip The red rose-bud from her lip! Her long love-locks, Cupid's angle! First uncurl, and then entangle! Or, to make her feel the smart Of a bruised and broken heart, I turn the tables and the tale, Whispering Miss herself is frail! Dem. Ah! Puck, but for that goblin sly, That merry antic in your eye Peeping, peering, laughing, leering, This would oddly in my ear ring! What! when vestals are so venal, Make a little flirting penal? Blooming cheeks of rosy hue, Sparkling eyes of heavenly blue Are, in every meeting, minster, Brought to market by the spinster! Is the purse of eighty weighty? Then trips eighteen off with eighty! The young widow of Cornutus Pairs with some soft son of Plutus! Of Mind what nymph the meaning knows? 'Tis not the small-talk of her beaux, Fine gems, fine flattery, fine clothes. Tell me not of earthly love, Evanescent and material! When the flame, in bowers above, Is immortal and ethereal! Tell me not of jealous scolds, Very wives! domestic furies! When my ravish'd sight beholds Sweet-voiced, soft-eyed, heavenly houris! Exquisite intelligences! Mind ennobling form and face And to the enchanted senses Beauty crowning mental grace! And tell me not of widows' caps, Set as matrimonial traps! Of fond Niobes and buxom, Trying their connubial luck, some Twice, thrice, faugh! for every man They keep the Chinese Widow's fan! Have I left my argent fields For aught this dreary planet yields? Earth, one mighty grave-yard, one Sepulchre moving round the sun! Have I left the bright, the vernal, Bloom unfading, bliss supernal, Skies unclouded and eternal, For Augusta Trinobantum, But to have of quiz my quantum? Land of dissonance and discord! Mammon jarring that and this chord; Where, by open fraud or stealth, The busy vermin pick up wealth Blacken'd with the smoke of hell, Yet passing current quite as well! Land of suffocating dens Fill'd with faces not like men's! Where we catch a ghastly glimpse Of half-naked hags and imps! Where the bell's incessant boom From his labor, from his loom Calls the pauper to his tomb! His birth-place on the mountain's brow, The fields o'er which he drove the plough, Carolling some love-epistle To the merry “Carman's Whistle!” The hospitable homestead, where The harvest feast, old Christmas fare Made glad the honest son of toil, And bound him to his native soil! The deepening glen, the opening glade, The holly and the hawthorn shade, The oak beneath whose clustering leaves He join'd the dance on summer eves, Neighbour crossing hands with neighbour To the merry pipe and tabor! The church where he his sabbaths kept, The graves where once his fathers slept, And the hoped-for resting-place Of himself and all his race! The green, the waterfall, the brook, All blotted from fair nature's book! For what? alas! around thee look, And, first, behold a patchwork pile. A gimcrack, in the “ornée” style! A garden, where, consumptive show! The flowers seem all ashamed to blow! Where the lily and the rose Droop their heads, their petals close, Water'd by a copious flood Of ochre, indigo, and mud! A paddock pauper-like and pimping, Where a lean nag, log-bound, limping, Sniffing from the pool pestiferous Exhalations odoriferous! Returns, with sympathetic neigh, His long-ear'd fellow-prisoner's bray! Their liberal Master next admire— Not the old-fashion'd English Squire Who never yet denied a bed To pillow the poor wanderer's head, Or sent him forth unhoused, unfed— But, let my laughing lungs have play Indignant scorn! yon “Yea and Nay,” Reserved, repulsive, square-built, squab, Dew-lapp'd Adonis dress'd in drab! Mammon-worshipper the slyest, Dogged disputant the dryest, Frigid formalist the merest, Fop fanatical the queerest, Sober sensualist the sleekest, Wolf in sheep's clothing the meekest! No welcome smiles his coming greet, The peasant fears his frown to meet! The village children look askance, And turn from his ill-favour'd glance. Thick clouds of “Devil's Dust” assail His nose and mouth, a stifling gale! And sweetly in his hearing peals, From parallelogram Bastiles, The music of the whistling wheels! Tall chimneys whence black columns rise, Trade's sooty incense to the skies! A sable and unsightly team Borne by bellowing blasts of steam, And leafless woods and voiceless groves Enchant his vision as he roves! For when he Dodona banish'd, With the rural goddess, vanish'd From their ancestral, sylvan realm The stately oak and lofty elm! Where once the sparkling fountain play'd In the honeysuckle shade, And to the listening young and old His tale the wounded veteran told, And to some future Nelson gave His early passion for the wave! Stands one of those misshapen piles On which the devil laid the tiles, Where quack economist from town (Too liberal to wear a gown!) Drawls utilitarian text, And preaches this world, not the next. As soon shall the good shepherd lead His fold on flinty rocks to feed, Forgetful of the flowery mead! As Hope shall bid the sinner hie To starve on such vile husks, and die! Hope, a star upon the main In the mariner's distress! A green spot on the desert plain, A fountain in the wilderness! Thus Poverty's from first to last By Mammon gripp'd and then held fast, And, skin and bone, to its last groan The unrelenting tyrant's own, And when death kindly enters in The slicing surgeon's, bone and skin! Fix your home (a sad locality!) In this world of stern reality (With no moody, misanthropic Smile I treat this mournful topic, Life's dark economy! that quite Subdues the laughing Abderite) Plenty you shall find to do For yourself and neighbour too. Mourn for sorrow—ask not why Life is but one long-drawn sigh! Folly let your lungs set crowing— Marvel not they're always going! Gape at ingratitude—in vain You'll try to shut your mouth again! Hark! the loud trumpet's brazen lungs, The shouts of thrice ten thousand tongues Proclaim the Pageant! and behold The sun's bright face of burning gold! Forbidden at the pomp to peep, The murky mists and vapours weep, As before yon ball of fire, Mizzling, drizzling, they retire! Did I rule this Saturnalia, Your Magnifico the Mayor Should cap, hood, and coxcomb wear, Bladder, bauble, fit regalia! And the hobby-horse bestride My Lord Misrule was wont to ride At once merry Christmas-tide! As the Pageant moves before us I will play the part of Chours, Then to Olympus, and report Its pomp to Jove and his high court. If, perchance, his royal scolder Heaven has made too hot to hold her, The God's good humour 'twill restore, And set the Mountain in a roar! [Exeunt. Scene XVII. THE PAGEANT.Democritus as Chorus. Trumpets sounding, colors streaming, Veteran swords of victory gleaming, Warriors, in their glittering corsair Casques with tails of redhot horsehair! In military pomp and pride Through yon tall Arch Triumphal ride! Follow Exons, Ushers, Grooms, Fine dress'd-out dolls for drawing-rooms! Chamberlains and Treasurers bold, Valiant Silver Sticks and Gold, Gaudy butterflies and vain beaus, Woods of wands, of ribbons rainbows, A dazzling firmament of stars, Guerdon meet of glorious scars, As when Anglesey, in barter, Lost a leg and won a garter! Maids of Honour, who as yet Are to old Time not much in debt, Duennas, deeply in arrears, In debt all over head and ears! Dummies in the show to-day With polite indifference play. Yeomen of Herculean mould In scarlet doublets dight with gold, Such as bluff King Harry wore, Burly Beef-eater of yore! Ever roving, ever ranging, Chopping his poor wives and changing! March in order, every man With his good sword and partisan. Moustached round the nose and lips Bouverie, Bowater, and Phipps, And warlike Whims, Whims, who better loves a joke, An Irish Bull or equivoque Than psalms and hymns! Guard the chariot where, sedate, Sit with the Sovereign tête à tête Two automatons of state, Just like patience (beating Job's!) The Mistress of the royal Robes, And, in full feather and full force, The mighty Master of the Horse! Mr. Merriman of the show Whims convulses Phipps and Co. And with his conundrums, quips, Relaxes even royal lips As he canters to and fro! Merry musical St. Martin This proud Pageant plays a part in, Waving, ringing from his steeple, Banners, and bob-majors triple! Squirt the fountains liquor very Different to the Sack and Sherry Tippled by the fiery Trigon Bardolph at Chepe's Conduit bygone— Cistern from the sober city Vanish'd, banish'd—more the pity! Flags peep from the “Pepper Boxes,” The Northumbrian Lion cocks his Tail, and “Pigtail Place's” Statue Seems to ride full gallop at you, Bearing, from St. Giles's border, Knights of its equestrian order. To-day has loyalty a rout, Turning houses inside out! Stuffs of every fashion, hue, Rich embroidery, old and new, Pictured arras, cloth of gold From the windows are unroll'd. Like Birnam wood and Dunsinane Is country come to town again! Every smoke-dyed wall is seen In Dodona's livery green! Sooty Tusculums and towers We can scarcely see for flowers! Ne'er wore the Strand such gay attire Since Robin and his festive Friar Led the Sylvan dance and choir Round the Maypole, blossoming With the early flowers of spring! Spring returns, in groves and dells The hyacinth hangs its silver bells, And Narcissus makes the bowers Fragrant with his snow-white flowers, But not to crown the floral scene Return the woodland King and Queen, And foresters in Lincoln green! Merry band! Merry band! They, alas! have left the land. London town, capacious hive Of busy bees! is all alive. Far as ever eye can see, Roof and chimney, tower, and tree Swarm with gazers to the top, Every lamp-post bears a crop! Curiosity, all eyes! Holds to-day its grand assize! Mammon, when perchance he dozes, Never more than one eye closes, But to-day he has, to copen, Argus-like, a hundred open! From the attic to the basement Every crevice, corner, casement, He, for gold and silver pieces, Lets, to see the show, on leases! Holy Paul, to be in keeping, Makes the public pay for peeping From his shilling gallery gay, Rising o'er the mouldering clay, Hollow cabinet of bone Reason's abdicated throne! Trumpets, trombones, horns and hautboys, Now or never! bray and blow, boys! Salt-boxes and fiddle-scrapers Make the people's teeth cut capers! Puff, Pandeans! pipers joint, Puff your faces to a point! Scotchmen vocal vengeance wreak On your bagpipes, make 'em squeak! For see, in boots, perchance the pair Erst worn by Jack the Giant-Slayer! Or Puss, when he abroad was seen Perambulating en bottine! With a military march Steps my Lord Mayor stiff and starch! Marshalled by a brandy face, A parish porpoise, and a mace, A tub upon ten gouty toes, A cock'd hat and a bottle nose! A beadle, as the saying goes. His brother Aldermen behind Their way unwieldy wadding wind, Each a corpus sine pectore, Pudding-cramm'd from the refectory! In the Common-council fall, Vegetable marrows all! Florid specimens of feeding, And a little brusque in breeding! To whom is Barclay's brewing rare As water to the Polar Bear! Whither with their wands of white Wend they? to that far famed site (To recruit them for the brawl) Where Ben Jonson and his “fellows” Attic revel! Supp'd at “The Devil” And sang “Old Rose and burn the Bellows.” Unhorsed, uncovered, slow, sedate, In his crimson velvet dress, Golden Collar of S S, And pigtail pendent With its satin rose resplendent! Magnus the Great Presents the Queen his Sword of State Made by the cutler to King Lud Somewhat later than the Flood At Vulcan's smithy! Touching the hilt, Superbly gilt! Her Majesty's reply is pithy, “Good, My Lord Mayor, take it wi' thee!” My Lord bows low his curly scalp, (What an intellectual Alp!) Then re-crowns it with his cock'd hat, Bestrides his steed, from Batty's stud, A rollicking, frolicking bit of blood Ready to gallop thro' fire and flood! And passes thro' the dingy gate On which, in days of olden date, Grinned ghastly many a trunkless pate Monarchs set up to be mock'd at! Hark! the powder; louder! louder! Thicker! quicker! come the shots; Another flash! another crash! Saluting from the chimney pots— Loyal Lumber-Troopers all, (Rank and file from Cogers' Hall!) If you play at this platooning You will set the city swooning! Rosinantes, two and two, Back'd by bogtrotters in blue, Trusty knaves, for whispering tales To fond, foolish Abigails, Blarney from the Bay of Bantry, For the freedom of the pantry! Lead the van; then, variorem Vehicles with a nag before 'em Of the Common-council Grandees, Where accommodation and ease Are, with elegance, combined, Lag, ad libitum, behind. Follow next those rival stars, The two Sheriffs' coxcomb cars, Hunter's, with its groggy dragons Glorified, supporting flagons; Sidney's, very much beholden To three Girdlers' gridirons golden. Rolls along the rumbling stand Of the Aldermanic band Which their worships, plain and plodding, Journey to the land of Nod in When, perchance potations deep Lull their dignities to sleep! And, of locomotive monsters Last, the crowning gewgaw on stirs! Where the painter and the builder, And the carver and the gilder, In artistical set-to, All past doings did outdo! There you shall see in the fulness Of mock-majesty and dulness (Sword-bearer and Sermoniser Each contributing his visor, Proper persons, very proper! To play anti-bottle-stopper To the kingly nose of copper!) Civic Sovereigns on particular Days when they become vehicular. Common-councilmen (the breed Rightly he who runs may read!) Peacock, Dixon, Godson, Gresham, Their poor cattle how they thresh 'em! Bedford, Bailey, Frodsham, Finnis, Whip and spur their kicking Jennies! Never since those palmy times, Recorded in old ballad rhymes, When to Essex rode the mayor With his court to hunt the hare, When huge Helluos were unhorsed, And saddles from their steeds divorced, Such a troop was seen, or read of, Riding each his horse's head off! The two City Marshals, each reining a roarer! Cry, “If you mean, In your gowns mazarine, Gambados, to split not the sides of the Queen, Cut not so many queer capers before her!” The gallant Sheriffs, horsemen good, Turn out their toes as sheriffs should! What between the mane and bridle, Neither pair of hands is idle! Sir Claudius the Beau, on his charger Adonis, Bows to the beauties that grace the balconies, Farncomb and Farebrother, (Bobbing like their brother!) Follow, with Key, On Bucephali three! Lucas and Wood, and Johnson and Carroll, (Their coursers bestriding like Bacchus his barrel!) Led by Sir Oracle, jog on together, Quizzing his new Spanish beaver and feather! The Common Crier, Beddome the Bold! Coerces a shyer Of twenty twice told! Sword-bearer Hick A palfrey propels, In his high Cap of Maintenance, Minus the Bells! Hark! an Apollonian air Proclaims the advent of The Mayor! (Inspiration of a bard Spinning doggrel by the yard, Three of which, the hawkers roar, You can buy for farthings four!) By a brace of nightingales With a chorus at their tails, (Major, minor, sharp and flat) To the tune of the “Frog in an opera hat!” Capriolling, horse and rider Both puff'd up with equal pride are, Bucephalus and Alexander Greater never look'd nor grander! In youth's spring-tide and beauty's pride Behold the radiant, Royal Bride Of Merrie England! merry still, Tho' merrier once, for love's grown chill! On her open brow and queenly Shines her triple crown serenely! Erin's jewel, Scotia's gem, Clas Merdin's regal diadem! Fair daughter of a race august! All Thrones, but Thine, have lick'd the dust! 'Twas Thine, unmoved, erect, sublime, That foil'd the fame-flush'd Gallic Mime, O'er the Usurper's head abhorr'd, That broke, in scorn! his charmed sword, And chain'd him to a rock on high To curse the juggling fiends, and die! Lady! to thy native land, At the altar of thy sires Thou did'st give thy heart and hand, While responsive, holy choirs Joyful Hallelujahs peal'd As the solemn vow was seal'd. Thine are now the dews of youth, The jubilation of the soul; Thine shall be this sterner truth, As after years successive roll, How well become that sacred vow A pensive heart, a thoughtful brow. Bright with glittering gold (mosaic!), Stuck with cameos, (gems Hebraic, O, for classical mythology What a parvenu apology!) Rejoicing in the reddest rose That Cranbourn Alley's garden grows, Rose that gives a blush suburban To her fierce and fiery turban! All fuss and flounce, all blonde and bounce, Grotesquely gay by starts and fits, Fringed and frill'd, double-distill'd! In state the City Madam sits A star in front of Mercer's Hall, The envy of the Ladies all! Who, most cruelly in eclipse, Look armories, and bite their lips! Among the chivalry of Cheap That Jerry should his saddle keep (On her bosom, when a wooer Hangs his pretty present to her, In the plenitude of pudden Jerry's vacant face and wooden!) Makes of Cheap the Venus very Vain of her Adonis Jerry! The proud palace of Pomposo Cuts a figure very so so! Site ignoble! where stood bilboes For refractory Cornhill beaus. Bonnets jaded, satins faded, Trudging east and west as they did! (A reunion of the Rump Of Poppins Court and Aldgate Pump!) Make the Palace of Pomposo Dowdy look and doloroso! Chantry's art has done its part— Here shall every British heart Hail the Trophied Warrior, who Made a mock of the Gallic Cock, (All moonshine, moustache, cheeks and stock!) And (sauve qui peut!) thrash'd him thro' France, Spain, and Portugal too! And made, like fleas, His Brummagem Bees Skip across the Pyrenees! And his Eagles flutter Like crows in a gutter! Who lowered his Flag The Tri-color rag! Took the gloss From his gingerbread Cross! And put him terribly out of tune On the Eighteenth day of June, Diable! a day When he ran away, Following the nose of Marshal Ney! At Waterloo! Who knocks? Colonel Cox! Leading his Artillery Troop To guard the Queen and taste the soup! The Pageant halts.—Aghast, agape, At the new monster's size and shape (Tite's Trapezium!) Critics cry, “Humph! Here's a prodigy! a triumph! Well, at portico and postern, Taste may up its eyes and nose turn! Wonder how those blocks gigantic Chance toss'd into forms so antic! For bricks and mortar only chance Could couple in so droll a dance! Brobdignagian pillars, props Shouldering Liliputian shops Not too large to swing a cat in, Not too small to take a flat in! Classic frieze the front enriching Where sit cross-legg'd tailors stitching! Gresham, a colossal Mammon, Hoisted up as high as Haman! And stout Sir Hugh, a watchman tall, Mounting guard at a fiddle stall! O! (Si monumentum quæris?) What a funny Phœnix here is! When old London's razed and rotten, Poor Sir Christopher forgotten! How will some Bœotian Bruins (Next to cotton mill in ruins!) Worship every stone and stick of This fine fabric! bear a brick off! Relic of what now October Christens in its senses sober!” On its topmost tower (The Grasshopper's bower!) Streams the herald of the free To every land and every sea! Beneath it gaudy banners flaunt, On a gastronomic jaunt! Of Goldsmiths and Skinners, Rare dogs for their dinners! Or Girdlers and Grocers Who to Roast Beef and Plum-Pudding never say “No, Sirs!” And now the new bells ring their first merry peal, And the Aldermen's horses dance round in a reel, Keeping time With their musical chime! Hark! cannon replies to the band's martial sound, As the Queen's satin slipper prints lightly the ground. Trumpeters, Æolus ne'er Of cheeks puffed out two purpler pair! Sheriffs, primed with port and prog, Who the fabled frog out-frog! Twelve pick'd Aldermen and portly, Greshams twelve, polite and courtly! Tite, of plaster mighty master! Jones, and Aston, Pollux! Castor! And the Mayor, on bended knee, Welcome the Pride of Kingdoms three To Her Grace's royal chamber Roof'd with gold and paved with amber! With cranio-verberative sound Their foreheads nine times knock'd the ground, Genuflexions jeopardising Inexpressibles, in rising! All the live-long day preceding Brushing up his ballad reading, For garlands foraging, and fyttes, The penny poesy of Pitts! (Pitts who, ere he went to heaven, Domiciled in Dials seven!) Vainly each Parnassian frump Invoking! his poetic bump Refreshing with a furious thump! Tossing, turning, fuming, fretting, Out of sorts completely getting, On the very brink and border Of despair was the Recorder! Hearing that the Muse's Idol On a visit was from Rydal, Him he sought to beg or borrow For the royal ear to-morrow Just a little doggrel dutiful Full of the Sublime and Beautiful! On that calm brow amazement mute Sat, when a voice like dulcet flute From a fairy form that flutter'd Round the poet's chamber, utter'd, “Ere moons thrice twelve shall wax and wane, Of sack butts three roll round again, Thy afflatus shall explode In one grand volcanic Ode To a battle by a fighter Most infuriate (for a mitre!), Such as never sedgy Camus Saw before, the ignoramus! Inflating lay and reverend lungs With the wordy war of tongues, Making echo with of cant a Priestly peal the halls of Granta! Dar'st thou put (a second Settle!) The Flying Horse upon his mettle, Rein him like a Rosinante For forensic strophe, ante, Yoke his royal neck of thunder To a City one day's wonder?” Whether to that bellman-bard (Muse of Messrs. Moses, Minories!) The man of law enclosed his card, Darkly hinting what a dinner is! Whether that Whitechapel rhymester Did his ready stumps betimes stir, And in the functionary's flip His sable beard devoutly dip, Must not, by way of episode, Detain us longer on the road. Lowly bows the jazey legal To the smiling Presence regal, Treble tries, and then contralto, Cracks his voice with Q in alt, O! Sweet falsetto, soft soprano, And chromatic all cry, “Ah, no!” Puck, who loves (I cry you mercy!) Mischief positively per se, Deeming it not infra dig. To ventriloquise a wig, Commands, con spirito, the song To rattle merrily along; The Aldermen, some jolly score, all Carolling as vicars choral! Song.—The Recorder. Your Majesty, now With my very best bow! Ere to good fare We cry, “War, to the knife!” Permit me, I pray, Just to sol fa, and say, 'Tis the triple proud day Of our Grasshopper's life! Elizabeth Tudor (The citizens woo'd her) One morning up screw'd her High courage, and came To lunch with our lessor, And christen, God bless her! This Mart's predecessor, And you've done the same! Chorus of Aldermen. Too ral lal, &amp;c. We've taken down churches, Pluck'd priests from their perches, (Trade, left in the lurch, is Distressing and strange!) Cupidity calls “A bas Bishops' Stalls! Down with St. Paul's To rebuild an Exchange!” All Sunday contriving, Nails knocking, screws driving, Our hammer's loud clamour Drown'd sermons and psalms! “Keep Sabbath Day holy,” Exclaims Dr. Croly; Cries Mammon, “Pooh! gammon! Confound your queer qualms!” Chorus. Too ral lal, &amp;c. We issued our firman, And forth came a German (In rouge and gamboge How his nondescripts grin!) To paint like a toy-shop This new-built decoy-shop, Where soon to some tune We'll take all the world in! We've cosmetics, corsets, Of jigs many score sets, Oil for the Brutus And curls for the crop, The last pretty sonnet, The new Paris bonnet, Polkas and Punch, Penny pamphlets and pop! Chorus. Too ral lal, &amp;c. Our cash is well spent If this feast give content To Her Highness of Kent, To your consort and court, And if should find place In Your Majesty's grace Our Petit-pâtés, Larded capons and port! Without more ado Condescend to fall-to, Gadzooks! our French cooks Are uncommonly clever— Your post, my Lord Mayor, Is behind the Queen's chair— Vive la Reine d' Angleterre! Reign Victoria for ever! Chorus. Too ral lal, &amp;c. Air.—The Queen. My Lord, and each worshipful Guila, Long may you barter and build! I wish you your pockets well fill'd, And so do the Prince and Mama— But I fear that Sir Robert, Ah! Ah! Has made a financial faux pas! And a hole in your money-bags drill'd; But shall this Burse (if not grill'd!) Your gingerbread quickly regild, And commerce bring back with eclat! As folks, left and right, quizz'd the Temple of Tite They, laughing, exclaim'd at the singular sight, “The Queen should have sung the response of the Crown Not to Marlbrook, but to Down, derry, Down!” Seated at the banquet, see Britain's Grace and Majesty! And behind the throne of beauty London's Lordship doing duty! Giving, with Stentorian burst, (The Second Toole out-Toole's the First!) The loyal toasts to be off-toss'd, That civic noses, at some cost, Have richly rubied and emboss'd! Hark! a sudden sound symphonious Makes the festive hall harmonious, Ebenezer Shave, Esquire, Of the Common-council choir, Vainly vocal! 's volunteering Something worth the royal hearing. Song.—Mr. Ebenezer Shave. Money makes the mare to go! without this golden spur The cunning jade will neither gallop, canter, trot, nor stir! Whichever side we jog along, the shady or the sunny, The burden is of every song “Money! Money! Money!” Up to shop and reap your crop, lest others rise and reap it; Money get by hook or crook, and when you've got it, keep it! Better be in spirit poor than poor, alas! in purse, Peculation's bad enough, but poverty's far worse! Money— —Why this sudden pause? Why start the eyes, and gape the jaws, Flush the cheeks with purple hectic Of the singer apoplectic? Forced-meat ball, that savoury bolus! Doing battle with Æolus, A fat turkey's wing, and truffle Keeping up the windy scuffle! Scare the screech-owls, every wheezer! From the throat of Ebenezer. That the mirth be not diminish'd Puck takes up the song unfinish'd. Puck. Since Money makes the mare to go, be it the golden spur To every good that man can on his fellow-man confer; Earth's most precious jewel is soft pity's heavenly light, Which as far outshines the gem, as morning does the night! Now comes on the crowning crisis! From the feast the Sovereign rises, The cortège moves; the nimble Mayor Thro' the lobby, down the stair, To the Centre of the Square Trips as if he trod on air! Proclaiming Heralds spare your lungs, Brass trumpets hold your noisy tongues! Shrill fifes and tinkling cymbals cease, Loud kettle-drums depart in peace! Let not the ambient air be stirr'd With a whisper or a word! For, with dignity inherent, Ocean's Queen and Heaven's Vicegerent Christens with the old cognomen (Lucky oracle and omen!) This new patchwork pile plethoric, Neither Norman, Gothic, Doric! And lest there should be any dearth Of pleasant and conceited mirth, A royal farce (perform'd at courts With great applause!) concludes the sports, In which my Lord plays (who but he!) Sir William Magnus malgre lui! Beauty, chivalry, and splendour Escort forth the Faith's Defender From monotonies away, Dish'd up for her every day! For flattery is the air she breathes, Flowery garlands are but wreaths Flung to favourites operatic, Putting folks in fits ecstatic! Folks to whom Italian airs Are more familiar than their prayers! Vanities have no variety, Splendour only is satiety, Awkward graces, foolish faces, Common people, common places, Have lost their mirth-provoking power To laugh away a listless hour! Merry bells and martial clangour Little move luxurious languor Fêted, sated, left no leisure, Not a moment's pause from pleasure! Pleasure, of which the vacant heart Feels happiness is not a part. While westward roll the royal wheels To loud huzzas and deafening peals! Each that not with feeding faint is Flies to the unfinish'd dainties, Pours post-prandial bumpers higher, “For which of us,” they all enquire, “Shall feast upon another Fire?” Gross money-grubbing sons of care Soon settle down to “as you were!” To sell and buy, (man's calling high!) To dream out life, then wake—to die! The languid moon's departing rays Shine dimly through the thickening haze, Black mire and rain flood street and lane, The City is itself again! And o'er steeple, tower and hall Dense fogs and darkness spread their pall! The Scene closes. Scene XVIII.—The Quadrangle of the New Royal Exchange. The Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, Aldermen, and Visitors discovered. Enter Democritus as Motley. Democritus.The Pageant o'er, the Banquet sped, And London's lordly Bishop fled, For this one day shall Motley play The part episcopal, and say, If not out of time and place, This apology for Grace? Are your coffers overcharged? Be your bounty then enlarged! Do your riches overflow? Turn their stream to human woe! Emulate that glorious river, Type of every Good the Giver! Blessing, by its rich redundance, Barren deserts with abundance! The Scene closes. Scene the Last.—Windsor Forest. Enter Democritus in his ancient costume, and Puck. Democritus. Again in this embowering wood We taste the sweets of solitude! Courteous Spirit! thanks to thee For thy gaiety and glee! For thy sympathetic art When sorrow play'd the scenic part, And when rose the vision higher, Thanks for thy ethereal fire! Better pleased was never visitor Than I, who had the rare good luck (Mr. Motley the Inquisitor!) To find a Pylades in Puck. Farewell, fantastic sprite! farewell Robin with the Protean spell! Merry mischief! moonlight spark! Doors unlocking in the dark! O, could thy enchanted Key Hearts but open! men would see Selfish bosoms, lock'd before, All their hidden springs outpour! Had thy voice this powerful charm To humble pride, revenge disarm, To kindle in mankind the flame Of virtue, friendship, honest fame, To plant amid the barren, frozen One green spot select and chosen Where, for, alas! they roofless roam, The Charities might find a home! To-morrow's sun, in sooth to say, Would shine upon the happiest day Since that bright morn which saw him rise On Eden's blissful Paradise! Puck. Ere part Philosopher and Fay With pensive thoughts for many a day! (The sweetest music sadness brings When we no longer hear the strings, And happiest hours, alas! we find Will leave some fond regrets behind!) Come and see! Come and see! The evening star our lamp shall be, As it leads along in light The choral host of heaven to-night, The sparkling grot, the glittering throne, The Queen and Court of Oberon! Haste we to the forest dingle And in fairy worship mingle At sweet Shakespeare's sylvan shrine, By good sprites On moonlight nights Raised to their High-Priest divine! Nature brings her offerings there, Garlands ever fresh and fair! Spring, the primrose bright with dew; Summer, flowers of every hue; Autumn, fruits; and winter, holly— Honest mirth, sweet melancholy, Pilgrims at his shrine appear, And pity drops her holiest tear! There no mortal steps intrude, Sacred is the solitude! Naught impure can entrance find, All reflects his heavenly mind! Oft on summer nights serene Is his gentle Spirit seen Hovering round the fairy dell Where his fancy loved to dwell! Haste, and on his altar now Cast thy wreath, then pay thy vow. Breezy mountains, crystal fountains, And of paradise the flowers, Frolic fancies, songs and dances, In this fairy land are ours! Spirits brighter, footsteps lighter, Tresses of more sparkling gold, Livelier graces, lovelier faces, Never yet did eyes behold! Not thy own celestial sphere Breathes sweeter music—Hark! I hear My tuneful Summons to appear! While beneath the moon's expanse Nature sinks in solemn trance, And the chantress of the night Fills the groves with sad delight! While blest spirits from above Guard from peril those they love, Whether on the land or deep They in darkness watch or sleep, We, upon the wings of wind, Leave this weary world behind. [Exeunt. THE STRANGER-GUEST It was a sunny Sabbath morn, the spring-time of the year, The earth look'd green and beautiful, the sky look'd bright and clear, And softly blew the freshening breeze and sweetly rose the lay Of feather'd woodland choristers blithe as the newborn day! Just putting forth its tender bloom? In him does sorrow speak With mute, expressive eloquence! His gaze is on the ground While they with turf so fresh and green build up the rising mound. “For whom flow fast those holy tears? for father weeps a son? The God of Truth shall guide thy youth, and let His will be done!” The Stranger said, and as he spake, and strove to speak again, A sudden, momentary pang shot through his heart and brain! “For one whose grief,” the youth replied, “a secret, silent woe, Nor respite gave him nor relief until it laid him low— Thou lookest like a comforter!”—the way he slowly led, And left to its dark loneliness and deep repose the dead! A mourner sat in solitude.—The battle and the storm Of life, alas! had all but wreck'd that once fair face and form, Yet shone there what time could not touch, what grief could not efface, A mind serenely beautiful, a meek and lowly grace. When in the darken'd chamber's gloom the vision met her view Of one who many, many years had been a mourner too! The youth to her inquiring look his sweet reply address'd, And soon their melancholy hearth received the Stranger-guest. With faltering tongue she, trembling, spake, with broken voice and low, And lifted up her hands in prayer and bow'd her head in woe! “The bitter cup, like Marah's fount, my Father gave may I, With patience and humility, devoutly drink—and die! The grave my early, only love has hidden from my sight, O, could I but as soundly sleep as he now sleeps, to-night! And rise with him, as he shall rise, on wings angelic borne, Never, never more to part, and never more to mourn! The sorrow that consumed his heart I, too, have borne, and bear; We had a Son, but he is lost! or lives he? and, ah! where? What friendly roof-tree shelters him? still does he to the slave Exalt the name and sing the praise of Him who walk'd the wave? For early, in the Book of Life, on Sinai's Mount he saw The trembling prophet from his Sire receive His holy Law, And heard the deep-toned thunders roll, and earth and heaven and hell Of Calvary's great Mystery the awful tidings tell! And he communed with holy men and told them his desire To bear the Cross to heathen shores; they fann'd his youthful fire— ‘Obey,’ they cried, ‘the monitor, its inward whisperings are Responses earnest to a voice above the morning star! Go forth, while life is in its spring, the messenger of Truth Which never falls with sweeter force than from the lips of youth! And when thou shalt (the battle won) in death, thy arms lay down, Upon the Christian warrior's head will shine the Conqueror's Crown!” Now soon must boundless ocean bear to some wild savage shore Our early hope!—He was resolved!—I heard the torrent roar! Death in a thousand ghastly shapes rush'd madly on my mind! In vain I strove against despair, I could not be resign'd! ‘Regard me not, forego thy love, forget that I am here;’ His father said, with quivering lip, and half suppress'd a tear! ‘But let thy filial piety a tender mother save, Thy duty stand, for some few years, between her and the grave! ‘Are there not sinful souls enough in Britain's wide domain? The infidel, the hypocrite, the openly profane! That thou should'st give thy sympathies to heathen men alone, And bear the lamp to other lands that ought to light thy own?’ The silent day of parting came—we none could bid farewell! For sad forebodings, like a cloud, upon our spirits fell— My son went forth, and with him went to Afric's burning shore This prayer, that once in secret breathed, was ne'er forgotten more. ‘The solitary Bark that rolls along the pathless deep With her freight of human souls may guardian angels keep! And speed the heavenly messenger, ye spirits blest! benign! Who, by the light of Bethlehem's Star, pursues his course divine.’ Long, moonless nights of grim repose succeeded storms by day, And lightnings, for the stars were not! illumed the watery way, But mountain-wave and hurricane that head shall never harm On whom the Lord Omnipotent has spread his heavenly charm! On one fair morn the land appear'd; the orient orb of day Made lustrous with his sheeny light the mountains and the bay, Parch'd nature panted for the breeze, man scarcely could respire, The sparkling waters roll'd along in floods of liquid fire! The arid hills and yellow sands their swarthy tribes display'd, Whose savage shouts and glittering spears distrust, alarm betray'd, But soon they met, in fellowship, the mission o'er the wave That never came to conquer worlds on this dark side the grave! The listening heathen heard with awe the gracious message sent, And on its young expositor his eye, in wonder, bent, He saw, by faith, to fallen man his paradise restored, He bound the Gospel to his heart, and trembled and adored! Dethroned and trodden in the dust were all his idols grim, And for the cry of war arose the morn and evening hymn! He drank of the Redeemer's Cup and brake His bread divine, And shared in the immortal hope that warms your hearts and mine. Fierce fever laid the preacher low upon a bed of pain, It raged in every prostrate limb, it burn'd in every vein! His weeping brethren prayed for him—how answer'd was their prayer A joyful host of the redeem'd shall one bright day declare! Ten winters since have pass'd away, again 'tis lovely Spring! No tidings of the Wanderer its vernal breezes bring! Break! break! my too-severely tried, my childless, widow'd heart; Farewell! delusive hope, farewell! from this sad hour we part. For I shall never see him more! His earthly race is run, He early bore the holy Cross, the Crown he early won! And now, with full-voiced Cherubim, he sits enthroned on high, Or, gentle task! to comfort me his spirit hovers nigh. Then should I from the realms of bliss his happy soul recall? And bind it, from mere selfishness, again in mortal thrall? My Father! be the sinful thought forgotten and forgiven, O, let him not descend to earth, but let me rise to heaven! And yet I would a little while delay my parting hour, To see this beauteous bud unfold into a lovely flower!” Then with a look of tenderness and with an accent sweet, She raised and kiss'd, with gracious tears, the stripling at her feet. “Thy father to my fostering care thy infancy consign'd, And he on whom the grave has closed inform'd thy opening mind, He led thee, with endearing art, thro' learning's classic bowers, And made fair wisdom's path of peace a pleasant path of flowers! And should'st thou forth a Pilgrim go, when I am in repose, To grace the Garden of the Lord and blossom like the rose! No mother will be doom'd to mourn, to bring repentance deep, No happy home made desolate, o'er which to fondly weep. And if thou, after years of care, anxiety and toil, To mingle with thy kindred dust, should'st seek thy native soil, Tho' this loved roof, yon village spire may sad remembrance wake, No sigh will heave for blighted hearts once left behind to break!” She paused—a deep convulsive sob was all the youth's reply— And then upon the Stranger fix'd her dark and searching eye; Their glances met—o'er memory pass'd a dim mysterious light— A shadowy dream—again it pass'd across her aching sight— “Speak! speak!” she cried, but ere he spake, behold the brightening beam Flash'd into full reality! no longer 'twas a dream! “Rejoice! rejoice! our prayer is heard! my lost! my only one! Sing to the Lord Omnipotent!—Great God! My Son! My Son!</field>
