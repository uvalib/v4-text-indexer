When Coridon a cruel heardgroomes boy, Yet somewhat us'd to sing, and with his peeres Carroll of love, and lovers sad annoy; Wearie of passed woe, and glad of present joy, Having instal'd his sunn'd, and ful fed steeres, Thus to the river his blisse signified Well as he couth, and turning all Unto the humming rivers fall, The woods and Eccho his song goodly dignified. Ye goodly nymphes that with this river dwell, All daughters of the yellow-sanded Chame, Which deepe in hollow rockes frame out your cell, Tell me ye nymphes, for you can surely tell; Is death the cause of life? or can that same Be my great'st blisse, which was my great'st annoy? Eliza's dead, and can it be Eliza's death brings joy to me? Hell beeing the cause, why heavenly is the joy? With floods of teares I waile that deadly houre, When as Eliza, Eliza blessed maide, Was married to death, and we giv'n as her dowre, And low descending into Plutoes bower, Scarce fils an earthen pot beeing loosely laid. Ah is there such power, such crueltie in fate? Can one Sunne one man see Without, and worse then miserie? Then farewell glorious pompe, and fickle mortals state. And yet ten thousand times I blesse that time, When that good Prince, that Prince of endles fame, Both in the yeares and our joyes springing prime, Strucke my glad eares and raisd my rugged rime To carroll lowd and herie his honor'd name. Ah is there such power, such bountie in fate? Can one Sunne one man see Worse, and without all miserie? Then welcome constant joy, &amp; never-changing state. Thou blessed spirit, sit thou ever there Where thou nowe sit'st, in heav'n, the worlds late wonder; Now heavens joy, and with that God yfere, Who still to thee, thou stil to him wast deare, Leave us unto the world and fortunes thunder; Or where thou dost that blessedness enjoy, Bid me, O quickly bid me Come there where thou hast hid thee, In Joves all-blessed lap without, and bove annoy. If not; ile live under thy sunshine rayes, And while the Fates afoard me vitall breath Ile spend it as thy tribute in thy praise. Dighting, such as I can, light virelaies, To thee, great Prince, whose life paies for her death, Thereto doe thou my humble spirit reare, And with thy sacred fire My frozen heart inspire: Chasing from thy high spirit all imperious feare. Then will I sing, and yet who better sings Of thee, then thine owne oft-tride Muse? Which when into thy heroicke spirit springs, The fields resound, and neighbour forrest rings, And sacred Muses leaving their woont use Of carroling, flying their loathed cell, Run to thy silver sound, And lively dauncen round: What caren they for Helicon, or their Pegasean well? Then thou thy selfe thy selfe historifie, But I in willow shade will chaunt thy name, And sing I will, though I sing sorrily, And thee, though little, I will glorifie, And shrilly pipe aloud, the whilst my Chame Shall answer all againe, thy name aye lives, While th' Oceans froathie hoare Beats on thy Brittish shore, And Albion threats the heav? with high whited clives. By this the old nights head gan to be gray, And dappled round with many a whited spot, So that the boy through ruinous nights decay, Saw the first birth of the new infant day, So up he rose and to his home he got; And all the way of James he lowdly sang, And all the way the plaine, Answered James againe: That all the woods of James &amp; th' heaven lowdly r?g. Phin. Fletcher. Regalis. THE LOCUSTS, OR APOLLYONISTS. To the right noble Lady Townshend. To my Friend the Author. When after-times read in thy living Muse The Shame of ours, it will be thought th' Abuse Of this blacke age, and that this matchlesse Crime Is th' issue of thy Braine, not of the Time. And though the Actors in this dismall Vow Had their deserts, yet dy'de they not till now. Thou giv'st them life: the life thy Verses give Is the reward of those that ought not live, But where their Plot and they may naked ly, And be made o're to lasting Infamy. Begin, and who approove not thy relation, Lik[e] Them and It, forfeit their preservation. H. M. THE LOCUSTS, OR APOLLYONISTS. CANTO I. 1 Of Men, nay Beasts: worse, Monsters: worst of all, Incarnate Fiends, English Italianat, Of Priests, O no, Masse-Priests, Priests-Cannibal, Who make their Maker, chewe, grinde, feede, grow fat With flesh divine: of that great Cities fall, Which borne, nurs't, growne with blood, th'Earth's Empresse sat, Clens'd, spous'd to Christ, yet backe to whoordome fel, None can enough, something I faine would tell. How black are quenched lights! Fa[l'n]e Heaven's a double hell. 2 Great Lord, who grasp'st all creatures in thy hand, Who in thy lap lay'st downe proud Thetis head, And bind'st her white curl'd locks in caules of sand, Who gather'st in thy fist, and lay'st in bed The sturdy winds; who ground'st the floting land On fleeting seas, and over all hast spread Heaven's brooding wings, to foster all below; Who mak'st the Sun without all fire to glow, The spring of heat and light, the Moone to ebbe and flow: 3 Thou world's sole Pilot, who in this poore Isle (So small a bottome) hast embark't thy light, And glorious selfe: and stear'st it safe, the while Hoarse drumming seas, and winds lowd trumpets fight, Who causest stormy heavens here onely smile: Steare me poore Ship-boy, steare my course aright; Breath gracious Spirit, breath gently on these layes, Be thou my Compasse, Needle to my wayes, Thy glorious work's my Fraught, my Haven is thy prayse. 4 Thou purple Whore, mounted on scarlet beast, Revel. 17. 2. 3. 4. 6. Gorg'd with the flesh, drunk with the blood of Saints, Whose amorous golden Cup, and charmed feast All earthly Kings, all earthly men attaints; See thy live pictures, see thine owne, thy best, Thy dearest sonnes, and cheere thy heart, that faints. Harke thou sav'd Island, harke, and never cease To prayse that hand which held thy head in peace. Else had'st thou swumme as deep in blood, as now in seas. 5 The cloudy Night came whirling up the skie, And scatt'ring round the dewes, which first shee drew From milky poppies, loads the drousie eie: The watry Moone, cold Vesper, and his crew Light up their tapers: to the Sunne they fly, And at his blazing flame their sparks renew. Oh why should earthly lights then scorne to tine Their lamps alone at that first Sunne divine? Hence as false falling starres, as rotten wood they shine. 6 Her sable mantle was embroydered gay With silver beames, with spangles round beset: Foure steedes her chariot drew, the first was gray, The second blue, third browne, fourth blacke as jet. The hollowing Owle her Post prepares the way, And winged dreames (as gnat-swarms) fluttring, let Sad sleep, who faine his eies in rest would steep. Why then at death doe weary mortals weep? Sleep's but a shorter death, death's but a longer sleep. 7 And now the world, &amp; dreames themselves were drown'd In deadly sleep; the Labourer snorteth fast, His brawny armes unbent, his limbs unbound, As dead, forget all toyle to come, or past, Onely sad Guilt, and troubled Greatnes crown'd With heavy gold and care, no rest can tast. Goe then vaine man, goe pill the live and dead, Buy, sell, fawne, flatter, rise, then couch thy head In proud, but dangerous gold: in silke, but restlesse bed. 8 When loe a sudden noyse breakes th'empty aire; A dreadfull noyse, which every creature daunts, Frights home the blood, shoots up the limber haire. For through the silent heaven hells pursuivants Cutting their way, command foule spirits repaire With hast to Pluto, who their counsell wants. Their hoarse base-hornes like fenny Bittours sound; Th' earth shakes, dogs howle, &amp; heaven it selfe astound Shuts all his eies; the stars in clouds their candles drown'd. 9 Meane time Hels yron gates by fiends beneath Are open flung; which fram'd with wondrous art To every guilty soule yeelds entrance eath; But never wight, but He, could thence depart, Who dying once was death to endlesse death. So where the livers channell to the heart Payes purple tribute, with their three-fork't mace Three Tritons stand, and speed his flowing race, But stop the ebbing streame, if once it back would pace. 10 The Porter to th'infernall gate is Sin, A shapelesse shape, a foule deformed thing, Nor nothing, nor a substance: as those thin And empty formes, which through the ayer fling Their wandring shapes, at length they'r fastned in The Chrystall sight. It serves, yet reignes as King: It lives, yet's death: it pleases, full of paine: Monster! ah who, who can thy beeing faigne? Thou shapelesse shape, live death, paine pleasing, servile raigne. 11 Of that first woman, and th'old serpent bred, By lust and custome nurst; whom when her mother Saw so deform'd, how faine would she have fled Her birth, and selfe? But she her damme would smother, And all her brood, had not He rescued Who was his mothers sire, his childrens brother; Eternitie, who yet was borne and dy'de: His owne Creatour, earths scorne, heavens pride, Who th'Deitie inflesht, and mans flesh deifi'de. 12 Her former parts her mother seemes resemble, Yet onely seemes to flesh and weaker sight; For she with art and paint could fine dissemble Her loathsome face: her back parts (blacke as night) Like to her horride Sire would force to tremble The boldest heart; to th'eye that meetes her right She seemes a lovely sweet, of beauty rare; But at the parting, he that shall compare, Hell will more lovely deeme, the divel's selfe more faire. 13 Her rosie cheeke, quicke eye, her naked brest, And whatsoe're loose fancie might entice, She bare expos'd to sight, all lovely drest In beauties livery, and quaint devise: Thus she bewitches many a boy unblest, Who drench't in hell, dreames all of Paradise: Her brests his spheares, her armes his circling skie; Her pleasures heav'n, her love eternitie: For her he longs to live, with her he longs to die. 14 But he, that gave a stone power to descry 'Twixt natures hid, and checke that mettals pride, That dares aspire to golds faire puritie, Hath left a touch-stone, erring eyes to guide, Which cleares their sight, and strips hypocrisie. They see, they loath, they curse her painted hide; Her, as a crawling carrion, they esteeme: Her worst of ills, and worse then that they deeme; Yet know her worse, then they can think, or she can seem. 15 Close by her sat Despaire, sad ghastly Spright, With staring lookes, unmoov'd, fast nayl'd to Sinne; Her body all of earth, her soule of fright, About her thousand deaths, but more within: Pale, pined cheeks, black hayre, torne, rudely dight; Short breath, long nayles, dull eyes, sharp-pointed chin: Light, life, heaven, earth, her selfe, and all shee fled. Fayne would she die, but could not: yet halfe dead, A breathing corse she seem'd, wrap't up in living lead. 16 In th'entrance Sicknes, and faint Languour dwelt, Who with sad grones tolle out their passing knell: Late feare, fright, horrour, that already felt The Torturers clawes, preventing death, and hell. Within loud Greife, and roaring Pangs (that swelt In sulphure flames) did weep, and houle, and yell. And thousand soules in endles dolours lie, Who burne, frie, hizze, and never cease to crie, Oh that I ne're had liv'd, Oh that I once could die! 17 And now th'Infernal Powers through th'ayer driving, For speed their leather pineons broad display; Now at eternall Deaths wide gate arriving, Sinne gives them passage; still they cut their way, Till to the bottome of hells palace diving, They enter Dis deepe Conclave: there they stay, Waiting the rest, and now they all are met, A full foule Senate, now they all are set, The horride Court, big swol'ne with th'hideous Counsel swet. 18 The mid'st, but lowest (in hells heraldry The deepest is the highest roome) in state Sat Lordly Lucifer: his fiery eye, Much swol'ne with pride, but more with rage, and hate, As Censour, muster'd all his company; Who round about with awefull silence sate. This doe, this let rebellious Spirits gaine, Change God for Satan, heaven's for hells Sov'raigne: O let him serve in hell, who scornes in heaven to raigne! 19 Ah wretch, who with ambitious cares opprest, Long'st still for future, feel'st no present good: Despising to be better, would'st be best, Good never; who wilt serve thy lusting mood, Yet all command: not he, who rais'd his crest, But pull'd it downe, hath high and firmely stood. Foole, serve thy towring lusts, grow still, still crave, Rule, raigne, this comfort from thy greatnes have, Now at thy top, Thou art a great commanding slave. 20 Thus fell this Prince of darknes, once a bright And glorious starre: he wilfull turn'd away His borrowed globe from that eternall light: Himselfe he sought, so lost himselfe: his ray Vanish't to smoke, his morning sunk in night, And never more shall see the springing day: To be in heaven the second he disdaines: So now the first in hell, and flames he raignes, Crown'd once with joy, and light: crown'd now with fire and paines. 21 As where the warlike Dane the scepter swayes, They crowne Usurpers with a wreath of lead, And with hot steele, while loud the Traitour brayes, They melt, and drop it downe into his head. Crown'd he would live, and crown'd he ends his dayes: All so in heavens courts this Traitour sped. Who now (when he had overlook't his traine) Rising upon his throne, with bitter straine Thus 'gan to whet their rage, &amp; chide their frustrate paine. 22 See, see you Spirits (I know not whether more Hated, or hating heaven) ah see the earth Smiling in quiet peace, and plenteous store. Men fearles live in ease, in love, and mirth: Where armes did rage, the drumme, &amp; canon rore, Where hate, strife, envy raign'd, and meagre dearth; Now lutes, and viols charme the ravish't eare. Men plow with swords, horse heels their armors weare. Ah shortly scarce they'l know what warre, &amp; armors were. 23 Under their sprowting vines they sporting sit. Th' old tell of evils past: youth laugh, and play, And to their wanton heads sweet garlands fit, Roses with lillies, myrtles weav'd with Bay: The world's at rest: Erinnys, forc't to quit Her strongest holds, from earth is driven away. Even Turks forget their Empire to encrease: Warres selfe is slaine, and whips of Furies cease. Wee, wee our selves I feare, will shortly live in peace. 24 Meane time (I burne, I broyle, I burst with spight) In midst of peace that sharpe two edged sword Cuts through our darknes, cleaves the misty night, Discovers all our snares; that sacred word (Lo[ck']t up by Rome) breakes prison, spreads the light, Speakes every tongue, paints, and points out the Lord, His birth, life, death, and crosse: our guilded Stocks, Our Laymens bookes, the boy, and woman mocks: They laugh, they fleer, and say, Blocks teach, and worship Blocks. 25 Spring-tides of light divine the ayre suround, And bring downe heaven to earth; deafe Ignoraunce, Vext with the day, her head in hell hath dro[wn']d: Fond Superstition, frighted with the glaunce Of suddaine beames, in vaine hath crost her round. Truth and Religion every where advaunce Their conqu'ring standards: Errour's lost and fled: Earth burnes in love to heaven: heaven yeelds her bed To earth; and common growne, smiles to be ravished. 26 That little swimming Isle above the rest, Spight of our spight, and all our plots, remaines And growes in happines: but late our nest, Where wee and Rome, and blood, and all our traines, Monks, Nuns, dead, and live idols, safe did rest: Now there (next th'Oath of God) that Wrastler raignes, Who fills the land and world with peace, his speare Is but a pen, with which he downe doth beare Blind Ignoraunce, false gods, and superstitious feare. 27 There God hath fram'd another Paradise, Fat Olives dropping peace, victorious palmes, Nor in the midst, but every where doth rise That hated tree of life, whose precious balmes Cure every sinfull wound: give light to th' eyes, Unlock the eare, recover fainting qualmes. There richly growes what makes a people blest; A garden planted by himselfe and drest: Where he himselfe doth walke, where he himselfe doth rest. 28 There every starre sheds his sweet influence, And radiant beames: great, little, old, and new Their glittering rayes, and frequent confluence The milky path to Gods high palace strew: Th' unwearied Pastors with steel'd confidence, Conquer'd, and conquering fresh their fight renew. Our strongest holds that thundring ordinaunce Beats downe, and makes our proudest turrets daunce, Yoking mens iron necks in his sweet governaunce. 29 Nor can th'old world content ambitious Light, Virginia our soile, our seat, and throne, (To which so long possession gives us right, As long as hells) Virginia's selfe is gone: That stormy Ile which th'Ile of Devills hight, Peopled with faith, truth, grace, religion. What's next but hell? That now alone remaines, And that subdu'de, even here he rules and raignes, And mortals gin to dreame of long, but endles paines. 30 While we (good harmeles creatures) sleep, or play, Forget our former losse, and following paine: Earth sweats for heaven, but hell keeps holy-day. Shall we repent good soules? or shall we plaine? Shall we groane, sigh, weep, mourne, for mercy pray? Lay downe our spight, wash out our sinfull staine? May be hee'l yeeld, forget, and use us well, Forgive, joyne hands, restore us whence we fell: May be hee'l yeeld us heaven, and fall himselfe to hell. 31 But me, oh never let me, Spirits, forget That glorious day, when I your standard bore, And scorning in the second place to sit, With you assaulted heaven, his yoke forswore. My dauntlesse heart yet longs to bleed, and swet In such a fray: the more I burne, the more I hate: should he yet offer grace, and ease, If subject we our armes, and spight surcease, Such offer should I hate, and scorne so base a peace. 32 Where are those spirits? Where that haughty rage, That durst with me invade eternall light? What? Are our hearts falne too? Droope we with age? Can we yet fall from hell, and hellish spight? Can smart our wrath, can griefe our hate asswage? Dare we with heaven, and not with earth to fight? Your armes, allies, your selves as strong as ever, Your foes, their weapons, numbers weaker never. For shame tread downe this earth: what wants but your endeavour? 33 Now by your selves, and thunder-danted armes, But never danted hate, I you implore, Command, adjure, reinforce your fierce alarmes: Kindle, I pray, who never prayed before, Kindle your darts, treble repay our harmes. Oh our short time, too short, stands at the dore, Double your rage: if now we doe not ply, We 'lone in hell, without due company, And worse, without desert, without revenge shall ly. 34 He, Spirits, (ah that, that's our maine torment) He Can feele no wounds, laughs at the sword, and dart, Himselfe from griefe, from suff'ring wholly free: His simple nature cannot tast of smart, Yet in his members wee him grieved see; For, and in them, he suffers; where his heart Lies bare, and nak't, there dart your fiery steele, Cut, wound, burne, seare, if not the head, the heele. Let him in every part some paine, and torment feele. 35 That light comes posting on, that cursed light, When they as he, all glorious, all divine, (Their flesh cloth'd with the sun, and much more bright, Yet brighter spirits) shall in his image shine, And see him as hee is: there no despight, No force, no art their state can undermine. Full of unmeasur'd blisse, yet still receiving, Their soules still childing joy, yet still conceiving, Delights beyond the wish, beyond quick thoughts perceiving. 36 But we fast pineon'd with darke firy chaines, Shall suffer every ill, but doe no more, The guilty spirit there feeles extreamest paines, Yet feares worse then it feeles: and finding store Of present deaths, deaths absence sore complaines: Oceans of ills without or ebbe, or shore, A life that ever dies, a death that lives, And, worst of all, Gods absent presence gives A thousand living woes, a thousand dying griefes. 37 But when he summes his time, and turnes his eye First to the past, then future pangs, past dayes (And every day's an age of misery) In torment spent, by thousands downe he layes, Future by millions, yet eternity Growes nothing lesse, nor past to come allayes. Through every pang, and griefe he wild doth runne, And challenge coward death, doth nothing shunne, That he may nothing be; does all to be undone. 38 O let our worke equall our wages, let Our Judge fall short, and when his plagues are spent, Owe more then he hath paid, live in our debt: Let heaven want vengeance, hell want punishment To give our dues: when wee with flames beset Still dying live in endles languishment. This be our comfort, we did get and win The fires, and tortures we are whelmed in: We have kept pace, outrun his justice with our sin. 39 And now you States of hell give your advise, And to these ruines lend your helping hand. This said, and ceas't; straight humming murmures rise: Some chafe, some fret, some sad and thoughtfull stand, Some chat, and some new stratagems devise, And every one heavens stronger powers ban'd, And teare for madnesse their uncombed snakes, And every one his fiery weapon shakes, And every one expects who first the answer makes. 40 So when the falling Sunne hangs o're the maine, Ready to droppe into the Westerne wave, By yellow Chame, where all the Muses raigne, And with their towres his reedy head embrave; The warlike Gnat their flutt'ring armies traine, All have sharpe speares, and all shrill trumpets have: Their files they double, loud their cornets sound, Now march at length, their troopes now gather round: The bankes, the broken noise, and turrets faire rebound. CANTO II. 1 What care, what watch need guard that tot'ring State Which mighty foes besiege, false friends betray, Where enemies strong, and subtile swol'ne with hate, Catch all occasions; wake, watch night and day? The towne divided, even the wall and gate Proove traitours, and the Councill' selfe takes pay Of forraigne States, the Prince is overswai'd By underminers, puts off friendly aid, His wit by will, his strength by weakenes over-laid? 2 Thus men: the never seene, quicke-seeing-fiends: Feirce, craftie, strong; and world conspire our fall: And we (worse foes) unto our selves false friends: Our flesh, and sense a trait'rous gate, and wall: The spirit, and flesh man in two factions rends: The inward senses are corrupted all, The soule weake, wilfull, swai'd with flatteries, Seekes not his helpe, who works by contraries, By folly makes him wise, strong by infirmities. 3 See drousie soule, thy foe ne're shuts his eyes, See, carelesse soule, thy foe in councell sits: Thou prayer restrain'st, thy sin for vengeance cries, Thou laugh'st, vaine soule, while justice vengeance fits. Wake by his light, with wisedomes selfe advise: What rigorous Justice damnes, sweet Mercy quits. Watch, pray, he in one instant helps and heares: Let him not see thy sins, but through thy teares, Let him not heare their cries, but through thy groning feares. 4 As when the angry winds with seas conspire, The white-plum'd hilles marching in set array Invade the earth, and seeme with rage on fire, While waves with thundring drummes whet on the fray, And blasts with whistling fifes new rage inspire: Yet soone as breathles ayres their spight allay, A silent calme insues: the hilly maine Sinks in it selfe, and drummes unbrac't refraine Their thundring noyse, while Seas sleep on the even plaine. 5 All so the raging storme of cursed fiends Blowne up with sharp reproach, and bitter spight First rose in loud uprore, then falling, ends, And ebbes in silence: when a wily spright To give an answere for the rest intends: Once Proteus, now Equivocus he hight, Father of cheaters, spring of cunning lies, Of slie deceite, and refin'd perjuries, That hardly hell it selfe can trust his forgeries. 6 To every shape his changing shape is drest, Oft seemes a Lambe and bleates, a Wolfe and houles: Now like a Dove appeares with candide brest, Then like a Falcon, preyes on weaker foules: A Badger neat, that flies his 'filed nest: But most a Fox, with stinke his cabin foules: A Courtier, Priest, transform'd to thousand fashions, His matter fram'd of slight equivocations, His very forme was form'd of mentall reservations. 7 And now more practicke growne with use and art, Oft times in heavenly shapes he fooles the sight: So that his schollers selves have learn't his part, Though wormes, to glow in dark, like Angels bright. To sinfull slime such glosse can they impart, That, like the virgine Mother, crown'd in light, They glitter faire in glorious purity, And rayes divine: meane time the cheated eye Is finely mock't into an heavenly ecstasy. 8 Now is he Generall of those new stamp't Friers, Which have their root in that lame souldier Saint, Who takes his ominous name from Ignatius. Strife, and Fires, Themselves with idle vaunt that name attaint, Which all the world adores: These Master lyers With trueth, Abaddonists, with Jesus paint Their lying title. Fooles, who think with light To hide their filth, thus lie they naked quite: That who loves Jesus most, most hates the Jesuite. 9 Soone as this Spirit (in hell Apollyon, On earth Equivocus) stood singled out, Their Speaker there, but here their Champion, Whom lesser States, and all the vulgar rout In dangerous times admire and gaze upon, The silly Commons circle him about, And first with loud applause they usher in Their Oratour, then hushing all their din, With silence they attend, and wooe him to begin. 10 Great Monarch, ayers, earths, hells Soveraigne, True, ah too true you plaine, and we lament, In vaine our labour, all our art's in vaine; Our care, watch, darts, assaults are all mispent. He, whose command we hate, detest, disdaine, Works all our thoughts and workes to his intent: Our spight his pleasure makes, our ill his good, Light out of night he brings, peace out of blood: What fell which he upheld? what stood which he withstood? 11 As when from mores some firie constellation Drawes up wet cloudes with strong attractive ray, The captiv'd seas forc't from their seat and nation, Begin to mutinie, put out the day, And pris'ning close the hot drie exhalation, Threat earth, and heaven, and steale the Sunne away: Till th'angry Captive (fir'd with fetters cold) With thundring Cannons teares the limber mould, And downe in fruitfull teares the broken vapour's roul'd. 12 So our rebellion, so our spightfull threat All molten falls; he (which my heart disdaines) Waters heavens plants with our hell-flaming heat, Husband's his graces with our sinfull paines: When most against him, for him most we sweat, We in our Kingdome serve, he in it raignes: Oh blame us not, we strive, mine, wrastle, fight; He breakes our troopes: yet thus, we still delight, Though all our spight's in vain, in vain to shew our spight. 13 Our fogs lie scatt'red by his piercing light, Our subtilties his wisedome overswaies, His gracious love weighs downe our ranck'rous spight, His Word our sleights, his truth our lyes displayes, Our ill confin'd, his goodnesse infinite, Our greatest strength his weaknesse overlaies. He will, and oh he must, be Emperour, That heaven, and earth's unconquer'd at this houre, Nor let him thanke, nor do you blame our wil, but pow'r. 14 Nay, earthly Gods that wont in luxury, In maskes, and daliance spend their peacefull daies, Or else invade their neighbours liberty, And swimme through Christian blood to heathen praise, Subdue our armes with peace; us bold defie, Arm'd all with letters, crown'd with learned bayes: With them whole swarmes of Muses take the field; And by heavens aide enforce us way to yield; The Goose lends them a speare, and every ragge a shield. 15 But are our hearts fal'ne too; shall wee repent, Sue, pray, with teares wash out our sinfull spot? Or can our rage with greife, and smart relent? Shall wee lay downe our armes? Ah, feare us not; Not such thou found'st us, when with thee we bent Our armes 'gainst heaven, when scorning that faire lot Of glorious blisse (when we might still have raign'd) With him in borrowed light, and joyes unstain'd, We hated subject crownes, and guiltlesse blisse disdain'd. 16 Nor are we changelings: finde, oh finde but one, But one in all thy troopes, whose lofty pride Begins to stoope with opposition: But, as when stubborn winds with earth ralli'de (Their Mother earth) she ayded by her sonne Confronts the Seas, beates of the angry tide: The more with curl'd-head waves, the furious maine Renues his spite, and swells with high disdaine, Oft broke, and chac't, as oft turnes, &amp; makes head againe: 17 So rise we by our fall: that divine science Planted belowe, grafted in humane stocke, Heavens with frayle earth combines in strong alliance: While he, their Lion, leads that sheepish flock, Each sheepe, each lambe dares give us bold defiance: But yet our forces broken 'gainst the rocke We strongly reinforce, and every man Though cannot what he will's, will's what he can, And where wee cannot hurt, there we can curse, and banne. 18 See here in broken force, a heart unbroke, Which neither hell can daunt, nor heaven appease: See here a heart, which scornes that gentle yoke, And with it life, and light, and peace, and ease: A heart not cool'd, but fir'd with thundring stroke, Which heaven it selfe, but conquer'd cannot please: To drawe one blessed soule from's heavenly Cell, Let me in thousand paines and tortures dwell: Heaven without guilt to me is worse then guilty hell. 19 Feare then no change: such I, such are we all: Flaming in vengeance, more then Stygian fire, When hee shall leave his throne, and starry hall, Forsake his deare-bought Saints, and Angells quire, When he from heaven into our hell shall fall, Our nature take, and for our life expire; Then we perhaps (as man) may waver light, Our hatred turne to peace, to love our spight, Then heaven shall turne to hell, and day shall chaunge to night. 20 But if with forces new to take the feild Thou long'st, looke here, we prest, and ready stand: See all that power, and Wiles that hell can yeeld Expect no watchword, but thy first command: Which given, without or feare, or sword, or sheild Wee'le fly in heaven's face, I and my band Will draw whole worlds, leave here no rome to dwell. Stale arts we scorne, our plots become black hell, Which no heart will beleeve, nor any tongue dare tell. 21 Nor shall I need to spurre the lazy Monke, Who never sweats but in his meale, or bed, Whose forward paunch ushers his uselesse truncke, He barrels darkenes in his empty head: To eate, drinke, void what he hath eat and drunke, Then purge his reines; thus these Saints merited: They fast with holy fish, and flowing wine Not common, but (which fits such Saints) Hence called Vinum Theologicum. Divine: Poore soules, they dare not soile their hands with precious mine! 22 While th'earth with night and mists was overswai'd, And all the world in clouds was laid a steep, Their sluggish trade did lend us friendly aid, They rock't and hush't the world in deadly sleep, Cloyst'red the Sunne, the Moone they overlaid, And prison'd every starre in dungeon deep. And when the light put forth his morning ray, My famous Dominicke tooke the light away, And let in seas of blood to quench the early day. 23 But oh, that recreant Frier, who long in night Had slept, his oath to me his Captaine brake, Uncloyst'red with himselfe the hated light; Those piercing beames forc't drowsie earth awake, Nor could we all resist: our flatt'rie, spight, Arts, armes, his victorie more famous make. Down cloysters fall; the Monkes chac't from their sty Lie ope, and all their loathsome company; Hypocrisie, rape, blood, theft, whooredome, Sodomy. 24 Those troupes I soone disband now useles quite; And with new musters fill my companies; And presse the crafty wrangling Jesuite: Nor traine I him as Monks, his squinted eyes Take in and view ascaunce the hatefull light: So stores his head with shifts and subtilties. Thus being arm'd with arts, his turning braines All overturne. Oh with what easy paines Light he confounds with light, and truth with truth distaines. 25 The world is rent in doubt: some gazing stay, Few step aright, but most goe with the croud. So when the golden Sun with sparkling ray Imprints his stamp upon an adverse cloud, The watry glasse so shines, that's hard to say Which is the true, which is the falser proud. The silly people gape, and whisp'ring cry That some strange innovation is ny, And fearefull wisard sings of parted tyranny. 26 These have I train'd to scorne their contraries, Out-face the truth, out-stare the open light: And what with seeming truths and cunning lies Confute they cannot, with a scoffe to sleight. Then after losse to crowe their victories, And get by forging what they lost by fight. And now so well they ply them, that by heart They all have got my counterfeiting part, That to my schollers I turne scholler in mine art. 27 Follow'd by these brave spirits, I nothing feare To conquer earth, or heaven it selfe assayle, To shake the starres, as thick from fixed spheare, As when a rustick arme with stubborne flayle Beates out his harvest from the swelling eare; T' eclipse the Moone, and Sun himselfe injayle. Had all our army such another band, Nor earth, nor heaven could long unconquer'd stand: But hell should heaven, and they, I feare, would hell command. 28 What Country, City, Towne, what family, In which they have not some intelligence, And party, some that love their company? Courts, Councells, hearts of Kings find no defence, No guard to barre them out: by flattery They worme and scrue into their conscience; Or with steel, poyson, dagges dislodge the sprite. If any quench or dampe this Orient light, Or foile great Jesus name, it is the Jesuite. 29 When late our whore of Rome was disaray'd, Strip't of her pall, and skarlet ornaments, And all her hidden filth lay broad displayd, Her putride pendant bagges, her mouth that sents As this of hell, her hands with scabbes array'd, Her pust'led skin with ulcer'd excrements; Her friends fall off; and those that lov'd her best, Grow sicke to think of such a stinking beast: And her, and every limbe that touch't her, much detest. 30 Who help't us then? Who then her case did rue? These, onely these their care, and art appli'de To hide her shame with tires, and dressing new: They blew her bagges, they blanch't her leprous hide, And on her face a lovely picture drew. But most the head they pranck't in all his pride With borrowed plumes, stolne from antiquitie: Him with blasphemous names they dignifie; Him they enthrone, adore, they crowne, they deifie. 31 As when an image gnawne with wormes, hath lost His beautie, forme, respect, and lofty place, Some cunning hand new trimmes the rotten post, Filles up the worme-holes, paints the soyled face With choicest colours, spares no art, or cost With precious robes the putride trunck to grace. Circles the head with golden beames, that shine Like rising Sun: the Vulgar low incline; And give away their soules unto the block divine. 32 So doe these Dedale workmen plaster over, And smooth that Stale with labour'd polishing; So her defects with art they finely cover, Cloth her, dresse, paint with curious colouring: So every friend againe, and every lover Returnes, and doates through their neate pandaring: They fill her cup, on knees drinke healths to th' whore; The drunken nations pledge it o're and o're; So spue, and spuing fall, and falling rise no more. 33 Had not these troopes with their new forged armes Strook in, even ayre, earth too, and all were lost: Their fresh assaultes, and importune alarmes Have truth repell'd, and her full conquest crost: Or these, or none must recompence our harmes. If they had fail'd wee must have sought a coast I'th' Moone (the Florentines new world) to dwell, And, as from heaven, from earth should now have fell To hell confin'd, nor could we safe abide in hell. 34 Nor shall that little Isle (our envy, spight, His paradise) escape: even there they long Have shrowded close their heads from dang'rous light, But now more free dare presse in open throng: Nor then were idle, but with practicke slight Crept into houses great: their sugred tongue Made easy way into the lapsed brest Of weaker sexe, where lust had built her nest, There layd they Cuckoe eggs, and hatch't their brood unblest. 35 There sowe they traytrous seed with wicked hand 'Gainst God, and man; well thinks their silly sonne To merit heaven by breaking Gods command, To be a Patriot by rebellion. And when his hopes are lost, his life and land, And he, and wife, and child are all undone, Then calls for heaven and Angells, in step I, And waft him quick to hel; thus thousands die, Yet still their children doat: so fine their forgerie. 36 But now that stormy season's layd, their spring, And warmer Sunnes call them from wintry cell; These better times will fruits much better bring, Their labours soone will fill the barnes of hell With plenteous store; serpents, if warm'd, will sting: And even now they meet, and hisse, and swell. Thinke not of falling, in the name of all This dare I promise, and make good I shall, While they thus firmely stand, wee cannot wholly fall. 37 And shall these mortals creep, fawne, flatter, ly, Coyne into thousand arts their fruitfull braine, Venter life, limbe, through earth, and water fly To winne us Proselytes? Scorne ease, and paine, To purchase grace in their whore-mistres eye? Shall they spend, spill their dearest blood, to staine Romes Calendar, and paint their glorious name In hers, and our Saint-Rubrick? Get them fame, Where Saints are fiends, gaine losse, grace disgrace, glory shame? 38 And shall wee, (Spirits) shall we (whose life and death Are both immortall) shall we, can we faile? Great Prince o' th' lower world, in vaine we breath Our spight in Councell; free us this our jayle: Wee doe but loose our little time beneath; All to their charge: why sit we here to waile? Kindle your darts, and rage; renew your fight: We are dismist: breake out upon the light, Fill th' earth with sin, and blood; heaven with stormes, and fright. 39 With that the bold black Spirit invades the day, And heav'n, and light, and Lord of both defies. All hell run out, and sooty flagges display, A foule deformed rout: heav'n shuts his eyes; The starres looke pale, and early mornings ray Layes downe her head againe, and dares not rise: A second night of Spirits the ayre possest; The wakefull cocke that late forsooke his nest, Maz'd how he was deceav'd, flies to his roost, and rest. 40 So when the South (dipping his sable wings In humid seas) sweeps with his dropping beard The ayer, earth, and Ocean, downe he flings The laden trees, the Plowmans hopes new-eard Swimme on the playne: his lippes loud thunderings, And flashing eyes make all the world afeard: Light with darke cloudes, waters with fires are met, The Sunne but now is rising, now is set, And finds West-shades in East, and seas in ayers wet. CANTO III. 1 False world how doest thou witch dimme reasons eies? I see thy painted face, thy changing fashion: Thy treasures, honours all are vanities, Thy comforts, pleasures, joyes all are vexation, Thy words are lyes, thy oaths foule perjuries, Thy wages, care, greife, begg'ry, death, damnation: All this I know: I know thou doest deceive me, Yet cannot as thou art, but seem'st, conceave thee: I know I should, I must, yet oh I would not leave thee. 2 Looke as in dreames, where th' idle fancie playes, One thinkes that fortune high his head advances: Another spends in woe his weary dayes; A third see[k]es sport in love, and courtly daunces; This grones, and weeps, that chants his merry laies; A sixt to finde some glitt'ring treasure chaunces: Soon as they wake, they see their thoughts were vaine, And quite forget, and mocke their idle braine, This sighs, that laugh's to see how true false dreames can faine. 3 Such is the world, such lifes short acted play: This base, and scorn'd; this high in great esteeming, This poore, &amp; patched seemes, this rich, and gay; This sick, that strong: yet all is onely seeming: Soone as their parts are done, all slip away; So like, that waking, oft wee feare w'are dreaming, And dreaming hope we wake. Wake, watch mine eies: What can be in the world, but flatteries, Dreams, cheats, deceits, whose Prince is King of night and lies? 4 Whose hellish troopes fill thee with sinne, and blood; With envie, malice, mischiefs infinite: Thus now that numerous, black, infernall brood O're-spread thee round; th'earth struck with trembling fright Felt their approach, and all-amazed stood, So suddain got with child, &amp; big with spight. The damned Spirits fly round, and spread their seede: Straight hate, pride, strife, warres, and seditions breed, Get up, grow ripe: How soone prospers the vicious weed! 5 Soone in the North their hellish poyson shed, Where seldome warres, dissention never cease: Where Volga's streames are sail'd with horse and sled, Pris'ning in Chrystal walls his frozen seas: Where Tartar, Russe, the Pole, and prospering Swed Nor know the sweet, nor heare the name of peace: Where sleeping Sunnes in winter quench their light, And never shut their eyes in Summer bright; Where many moneths make up one onely day, and night: 6 There lie they cloyst'red in their wonted Cell: The sacred nurseries of the Societie: They finde them ope, swept, deck't: so there they dwell, Teaching, and learning more and more impietie. There blow their fires, and tine another hell, There make their Magazine, with all varietie Of fiery darts; the Jesuites helpe their friends: And hard to say, which in their spightfull ends More vexe the Christian world, the Jesuites, or the Fiends. 7 The Fiends finde matter, Jesuites forme; those bring Into the mint fowle hearts, sear'd conscience, Lust-wandring eyes, eares fil'd with whispering, Feet swift to blood, hands gilt with great expence, Millions of tongues made soft for hammering, And fit for every stampe, but truths defence: These (for Romes use, on Spanish anvile) frame The pliant matter; treasons hence diflame, Lusts, lies, blood, thousand griefes set all the world on flame. 8 But none so fits the Polish Jesuite, As Russia's change, where exil'd Hierom Patriarch of the Greeke Church came unto Mosco in the yeare 1588. sold to Theodore Ivanovich Emperour of Russia his Patriarchal right; who presently installed into it the Metropolitane of Mosco. Grecian Priest Late sold his Patriarchal chaire, and right; That now proud Mosko vants her lofty crest Equall with Rome: Romes head full swolne with spight, Scorning a fellow head, or Peer, but Christ, Straines all his wits, &amp; friends; they worke, they plod With double yoke the Russian necks to load; To crowne the Polish Prince their King, the Pope their God. 9 The fiends, and times yeeld them a fit occasion To further their designes: for late a Borrise Federowich brother to the Empresse of Russia, having by the simplicitie of that Emperour aspired to that kingdome, by murther of the chiefe Nobility, ct extirpation of the royall seed; entred as subtily as he ruled cruelly, ct died foolishly, killing himselfe wh? his treasures were yet untoucht ct great, ct the chiefe City might have beene won to have stood to him. Beast Of salvage breed, of straunge and monsterous fashion, Before a Fox, an Asse behind, the rest A ravenous Wolfe, with fierce, but slie invasion Enters the Russian court, the Lyons nest, Worries the Lions selfe, and all his brood: And having gorg'd his mawe with royall blood, Would sleepe. Ah short the rest, that streames from such a food! 10 Ah silly man, who dream'st, that honour stands In ruling others, not thy selfe!

Base state, where but one Tyrant realmes commands: Worse, where one single heart serves thousand knaves. Would'st thou live honoured? Clip ambitious wing, To reasons yoke thy furious passions bring. Thrice noble is the man, who of himselfe is King. 11 With mimicke skill, they trayne a Griskey Strepey a Mosique, ct sometime Chorister at Precheste in Mosko, and from thence with an Embassadour passing into Polonia, and there cloystered, was taught by the Jesuites to play the King, and usurping the name of Demetrius (slaine by Borrise Federowich) under that mask with the Polonian forces, and by the revolt of the Russes was crowned Emperour. caged beast, And teach him play a royall Lyons part: Then in the Lyons hide, and titles drest They bring him forth: he Master in his art, Soone winnes the Vulgar Russe, who hopes for rest In chaunge; and if not ease, yet lesser smart: All hunt that monster, he soone melts his pride In abject feare; and life himselfe envi'de: So whelp't a Fox, a Wolfe he liv'd, an Asse he di'de. 12 Proud of his easy crowne and straunge successe, The [ At his first entry the counterfeit Demetrius, wan the applause and good opinion of many, and very politickly behaved himse[l]fe: but when he conceaved himselfe to be setled on the throne; he grew lascivious, and insolent, and bloody: and by a conspiracy was slaine, and his dead corps exposed to all shame and contempt.] second beast (sprung of a baser brood) Comes on the stage, and with great seemelinesse Acts his first scenes; now strong 'gins chaunge his mood, And melts in pleasure, lust, and wantonnesse: Then swimmes in other, sinkes in his owne blood. With blood, and warres the ice and liquid snowes Are thaw'd; the earth a red sea overflowes. Quarrells by falling rise, and strife by cutting growes. 13 Some fiends to Grece their hellish firebrands bring, And wake the sleeping sparks of Turkish rage; Where once the lovely Muses us'd to sing, And chant th' Heroes of that golden age; Where since more sacred Graces learn'd to string That heav'nly lyre, and with their canzons sage Inspirit flesh, and quicken stinking graves, There (ah for pitty!) Muses now are slaves, Graces are fled to heav'n, and hellish Mahomet raves. 14 But Lucifers proud band in prouder Spaine Disperse their troopes: some with unquench't ambition Inflame those Moorish Grandes, and fill their braine With subtile plots; some learne of th' Inquisition To finde new torments, and unused paines: Some traine the Princes with their lewd tuition, That now of Kings they scorne to be the first, But onely: deep with Kingly dropsies pierc't Their thirst drinkes kingdomes downe, their drinking fires their thirst. 15 Ãquivocus, remembring well his taske, And promise, enters Rome; there soone he eyes Waters of life tunn'd up in stinking caske Of deadly errours poyson'd truth with lies: There that stale purple Whore in glorious maske Of holy Mother Church he mumming spies, Dismounted from her seven headed beast, Inviting all with her bare painted breast, They suck, steep, swell, and burst with that envenom'd feast. 16 Nor stayes, till now the stately Court appeares, Where sits that Priest-King, all the Alls Soveraigne: Three mitred crownes the proud Impostor weares, For he in earth, in hell, in heav'n will raigne: And in his hand two golden keyes he beares, To open heav'n and hell, and shut againe. But late his keyes are marr'd, or lost; for hell He cannot shut, but opes, and enters well: Nor heav'n can ope, but shut; nor heav'n will buy, but sell. 17 Say Muses, say; who now in those rich fields Where silver Tibris swimmes in golden sands, Who now, ye Muses, that great scepter wields, Which once sway'd all the earth with servile bands? Who now those Babel towres, once fallen, builds? Say, say, how first it fell, how now it stands? How, and by what degrees that Citie sunk? Oh are those haughty spirits so basely shrunk? Cesars to chaunge for Friers, a Monarch for a Monk? 18 Th' Assyrian Lyon deck't in golden hide, Dan. 7. 4. Once grasp't the Nations in his Lordly paw: But him the Persian silver Beare defi'd, Dan. 7. 5. Tore, kill'd, and swallowed up with ravenous jaw; Whom that Greeke Leopard no sooner spi'de, Dan. 7. 6. But slue, devour'd, and fill'd his empty maw: But with his raven'd prey his bowells broke; So into foure divides his brasen yoke. Stol'ne bits, thrust downe in hast, doe seldome feed, but choke. 19 Meane time in Tybris fen a dreadfull Beast Dan. 7. 7. With monstrous breadth, and length seven hills o're-spreads: And nurst with dayly spoyles and bloody Feast Grew up to wondrous strength: with seven heads, Arm'd all with iron teeth, he rends the rest, And with proud feet to clay and morter treads. And now all earth subdu'de, high heav'n he braves, The head he kills, then 'gainst t[h]e body raves: With Saintly flesh he swells, with bones his den he paves. 20 At length five heads were fall'ne; the sixt retir'd Apoc. 17. 10. By absence yeelds an easy way of rising To th' next, and last: who with ambition fir'd, In humble weeds his haughty pride disguising, By slow, sly growth unto the top aspir'd: Unlike the rest he veiles his tyrannising With that Lambs head, &amp; horns: both which he claimes; Apoc. 13. 11. Thence double raigne, within, without hee frames: His head the Lamb, his tongue the Dragon loud proclames. 21 Those Fisher Swaynes, whome by full Jordans wave The Seas great Soveraigne his art had taught, To still loud stormes when windes and waters rave, To sink their laden boats with heavenly fraught, To free the fish with nets, with hookes to save: For while the fish they catch, themselves were caught: And as the scaly nation they invade, Were snar'd themselves. Ah much more blessed trade That of free Fisher swaines were captive fishes made! 22 Long since those Fisher swains had chang'd their dwelling; Their spirits (while bodies slept in honour'd toombes) Heavens joyes enjoy, all excellence excelling; And in their stead a crue of idle groomes By night into the ship with ladders stealing, Fearles succeed, and fill their empty roomes. The fishers trade they praise, the paynes deride: Their narrow bottomes strech they large &amp; wide, And make broad roomes for pomp, for luxury, and pride. 23 Some from their skiffs to crownes and scepters creep, Heavens selfe for earth, and God for man rejecting: Some snorting in their hulks supinely sleep, Seasons in vaine recall'd, and winds neglecting: Some nets, and hookes, and baits in poyson steep, With deathfull drugges the guiltles seas infecting: The fish their life and death together drink; And dead pollute the seas with venom'd stink: So downe to deepest hell, both fish and fishers sink. 24 While thus they swimme in ease, with plenty flowe, Each losel gets a boat, and will to sea: Some teach to work, but have no hands to rowe; Some will be lights, but have no eyes to see; Some will be guides, but have no feete to goe; Some deafe, yet ears; some dumbe, yet tongues will bee; Some will bee seasoning salt, yet drown'd in gall: Dumbe, deafe, blinde, lame, and maime; yet fishers all, Fit for no other use but 'store an Hospitall. 25 Mean time the Fisher, which by Tibers bankes Rul'd leasser boates, casts to enlarge his See: His ship (even then too great) with stollen plankes Length'ning, he makes a monstrous Argosie; And stretches wide the sides with out-growne flankes: Peter, and Paul his badge, this' sword, that's key His feyned armes: with these he much prevailes, To him each fisher boy his bonnet veyles, And as the Lord of seas adores with strooken sayles: 26 Nor could all Seas fill up his empty mawe; For earth he thirsts; the earth invades, subdues: And now all earthly Gods with servile awe Are highly grac't to kisse his holy shooes: Augustus selfe stoops to his soveraigne lawe, And at his stirrop close to lacky sues: Then heavens scepter claymes, then hell and all. Strange turne of chaunges! To be lowe, and thrall Brings honour, honour strength, strength pride, and pride a fall. 27 Upon the ruines of those marble towres, Founded, and rays'd with skill, and great expence Of auncient Kings, great Lords, and Emperours, He built his Babel up to heav'n, and thence Thunders through all the world: On sandy floores The ground-worke slightly floats, the walls to sense Seeme Porphyr faire, which blood of Martyrs taints; But was base lome, mixed with strawy Saints; Daub'd with untemper'd lime, which glistering tinfoyle paints. 28 The Portall seemes (farre off) a lightsome frame; But all the lights are false; the Chrystall glasse Back't with a thick mud-wall beates off the flame, Nor suffers any sparke of day to passe. There sits dull Ignoraunce, a loathly dame, Two eyes, both blind; two eares, both deafe shee has; Yet quick of sense they to her selfe appeare. Oh who can hope to cure that eye, and eare, Which being blind, &amp; deafe, bragges best to see, &amp; heare! 29 Close by her children two; of each side one, A Sonne and Daughter sate: he Errour hight, A crooked swaine; shee Superstition. Him Hate of Truth begot in Stygian night; Her Feare, and falsely call'd, Devotion; And as in birth, so joyn'd in loose delight, They store the world with an incestuous breed, A bastard, foule, deform'd, but num'rous seed; All monsters; who in parts, or growth, want, or exceed. 30 Her Sonne invites the wandring passengers And calls aloud, Ho, every simple swaine Come, buy crownes, scepters, miters, crosiers, Buy thefts, blood, incests, oaths, buy all for gaine: With gold buy out all Purgatory feares, With gold buy heaven and heavens Soveraigne. Then through an hundred Labyrinths he leads The silly soule, and with vaine shadowes feeds: The poore stray wretch admires old formes, and anticke deeds. 31 The daughter leads him forth in Pilgrims guise To visite holy shrines, the Lady Hales; The Doves, and Gabriels plumes in purple dyes, Cartloads of Crosse, and straunge-engendring nayles: The simple man adores the sottish lyes: Then with false wonders his frayle sense assayles, Saint Saint Fulbert sucked the brests of the blessed Virgine, so saith Bar[o]nius, Annal. 1028. n. 5.Fulbert nurst with milke of Virgine pure, Saint Dominicks Dominicks books lay dry a whole night in a river.

Crownes and uncrownes men by God deifi'de. Dan. 7. 8. He is that seeing, and proud-speaking Horne, Who stiles himselfe Spouse of that glorious Bride; The All these titles ct many more are given to the Popes by their vassals, and by them accepted and justified. Churches Head, and Monarch; Jesses rod; The precious corner stone; supreame Vice-God; The Light, the Sunne, the Rock, the Christ, the Lord our God. 34 There stand the Pillars of the Papacie; Stout Champions of Romes Almighty power, Carv'd out as patterns to that holy See. First was that Boniface, the cheifest flower Boniface 3. In Papal Paradise, who climb'd to bee First universall Bishop-governour. Then he, that would be Pope and Emperour too: Boniface 8. And close by them, that monstrous Prelate, who Trampled great Fredericks necke with his proud durty shooe. Alexander 3. 35 Above the rest stood famous Hildebrand, The Father of our Popish chastitie: Who forc't brave Henry with bare feet to stand, And beg for entrance, and his amitie. Finely the workman with his Dedal hand Had drawne disdaine sparkling in's fiery eie, His face all red with shame and angry scorne, To heare his sonne lament, his Empresse mourne, While this chast Father makes poore Asto weare the horn. 36 There stood Lucretia's Father, Husband, Brother, Alexand. 6. The monster Borgia, cas'd in lust and blood: And he that fil'd his child, and quell'd his Mother: Paul 3. He, that was borne, liv'd, died in lust: there stood Pius 4. The female Pope, Romes shame, and many other John 8, or rather Joan. Kindled for hell on earth in lustfull flood. These Saints accurse the married chastity, A wife defiles: oh deep hypocrisy! Yet use, reward, and praise twice burning Sodomy. 37 And with those fleshly stood the spirituall Bauds: They choose, and frame a goodly stone, or stock, Then trimme their puppet god with costly gauds. Ah who can tell which is the verier block, His god, or he? Such lyes are godly frauds. Some whips adore, the crosse, the seamelesse frock, Nayles, speare, reed, spunge; some needing no partaker, Nor using any help, but of the Baker, (Oh more then power divine!) make, chew, and voide their Maker. 38 By these were plac'd those dire incarnate fiends Studied in that black art, and that alone: One leagu'd himselfe to hell t' effect his ends, Silvester 2 and many others. In Romes Bee-hive to live the Soveraigne Drone: Another musters all the Divels his friends Gregory 7. To pull his Lord out of his rightfull throne; And worse then any fiend, with magicke rite He casts into the fire the Lord of light: So sacrific'd his God to an infernall spright. 39 But who can summe this holy rablement? This prais'd the Gospel as a gainfull tale; Leo 10. That questions heav'ns reward, hels punishment; This for his dish in spight of God doth call; John 23, and 24. Henry Emperour waspoysonea in the Sacrament given by a Preist, set on by Robert King of Naples, and Robert by Clement 5. Avent. That heaven taints, infects the Sacrament; The bread, and seale of life perpetuall: And pois'ning Christ, poisons with him his King; He life and death in one draught swallowing, Wash't off his sinfull staines in that Lifes deadly spring. CANTO IIII. 1 Looke as a goodly Pile, whose ayrie towres Thrust up their golden heads to th' azure sky, But loosely leanes his weight on sandy floores: Such is that mans estate, who looking high, Grounds not his sinking trust on heavenly powres: His tott'ring hopes no sooner live, but die. How can that frame be right, whose ground is wrong? Who stands upon his owne legges, stands not long: For man's most weake in strength, in weaknes only strong. 2 Thus Rome (when drench't in seas of Martyrs blood, And tost with stormes, yet rooted fast on Christ) Deep grounded on that rocke most firmely stood: But when, with pride and worldly pompe entic't She sought her selfe, sunke in her rising flood. So when of late that boasted Jesuite Priest Drury Gath'red his flocke, and now the house 'gan swell, And every eare drew in the sugred spell, Their house, and rising hopes, swole, burst, and head-long fell. 3 Through this knowne entraunce past that subtile Spright: There thundring Paul retir'd he sullen found, Boyling his restles heart in envious spight, Gall'd with old sores, and new Venetian wound: His thoughtfull head lean'd downe his carefull weight Upon a chayre, farre fetch't from Dodon ground. Thence without feare of errour they define; For there the Spirit his presence must confine. Oh more then God, who makes his bread, blocks, chayres divine! 4 But that true Spirit's want this false supplies: He folds that Scorners chayre in's cloudy wings, And paints, and gilds it fayre with colour'd lies. But now from's damned head a snake he flings Burning in flames: the subtile Serpent flies To th' aymed marke, and fills with firy stings The Papal brest; his holy bosome swells With pride &amp; rage; straight cals for books, lights, bells, Frets, fumes, fomes, curses, chafes, and threatens thousand hells. 5 So when cold waters wall'd with brasen wreath Are sieg'd with crackling flames, their common foe, The angry seas 'gin fome and hotly breath, Then swell, rise, rave, and still more furious grow: Nor can be held; but, prest with fires beneath, Tossing their waves breake out, and all o'reflow. In hast he calls a Senate; thither runne The blood-red Cardinalls, Friers white, and dunne, And with, and 'bove the rest Ignatius' eldest sonne. 6 The conclave fills apace; now all are met: Each knowes his stall, and takes his wonted place. So downe they sit; and now they all are set: Ãquivocus, with his bat-wing'd embrace, Clucks, broods his chickens, while they sadly treat; Their eyes all met in th' holy Fathers face, There first foresee his speech: a dusky cloud Hangs on his brow; his eyes fierce lightnings shroud, At length they heare it breake, and rore in thunders loud. 7 Thrice-glorious founders of Romes Hierarchy, Whose towring thoughts and more then manly spirit Beyond the spheares have ray'sd our Monarchy, Nor earth, nor heaven can pay your boundlesse merit. Oh let your soules above the loftiest sky Your purchast crownes and scepters just inherit. Here in your pourtraits may you ever live; While wee (poore shadowes of your pictures) grieve Our sloth should basely spend, what your high vertues give. 8 I blush to view you: see Priest-kings, oh see Their lively shades our life as shades upbrayd: See how his face sparkles in majesty, Who that first stone of our vast Kingdome layd, Boniface 3. Spous'd the whole Church, and made the world his See: With what brave anger is his cheek arrayd, Who Peters useles keyes in Tiber flings? How high he lookes that treades on Basilisks stings, Julius 8. And findes for's lordly foot no stool, but necks of Kings? Alexander 3. 9 See where among the rest great Clement stands, Clement 5. Lifting his head 'bove heaven, who Angels cites And bids them lowly stoop at his commands, And waft tir'd soules to those eternall lights. But what they wonne, we loose; Townes, Cities, Lands Revolt: our Buls each petty Lamb-kin slights: We storme and thunder death, they laugh, and gren. How have we lost our selves? Oh where, and when Were we thus chang'd? Sure they were more, we lesse then men. 10 Can that uncloist'red Frier with those light armes, Luther. That sword and shield, which we mocke, scorne, defie, Wake all the sleeping world with loud alarmes, And ever conqu'ring live, then quiet die? And live, and dead load us with losse and harmes? A single simple Frier? And oh shall I, Christ, God on earth, so many losses beare With peace and patience? Who then Rome will feare? Who then to th' Romane God his heart and hands will reare? 11 Belgia is wholy lost, and rather chuses Warres, flame, and blood, then peace with Rome &amp; Spain. Fraunce halfe fal'ne off, all truce and parl' refuses: Edicts, massacres, leagues, threats, all are vaine. Their King with painted shew our hope abuses, And beares our forced yoke with scorne, and paine. So Lyons (bound) stoop, crouch with fained awe, But (loos'd) their Keeper seize with Lordly paw, Drag, rend, &amp; with his flesh full gorge their greedy maw. 12 See where proud Dandal chain'd, some scraps expecting, Dandalus Duke of Venice was c?peld by the Pope Clement the 5. to crouch under the table chained like a dogge, before he could obtain peace for the Venetians. Lies cur-like under boord, and begs releife: But now their Corno our three crownes neglecting Censures our sacred Censures, scornes our Briefe. Our English plots some adverse power detecting Doubles their joy, trebles our shame and griefe. What have we reap't of all our paines and seed? Seditions, murthers, poysons, treasons breed To us more spight and scorne; in them more hate &amp; heed. 13 That fleet, which with the Moone for vastnesse stood, Which all the earth, which all the sea admires, Amaz'd to see on waves a Moone of wood, Blest by our hands, frighted with suddaine fires And Panicke feares, sunke in the gaping flood: Some split, some yeeld, scarce one (that torne) retires. That long wish't houre, when Cynthia set i' th' maine, What hath it brought at length, what change, what gain? One bright star fell, the Sun is ris'ne, and all his traine. 14 But Fates decree our fall: high swelling The Card. Giure made a motion in the holy office concerning the moderating the Popes titles. But the Pope would give no way to it: as beeing no greater then the authority of Peters successour did require. names Of Monarch, Spouse, Christ, God, breed much debate, And heape disdaine, hate, envy, thousand blames: And shall I yeeld to envy, feare their hate, Lay downe my titles, quit my justest claimes? Shall I, earths God, yeeld to uncertaine fate? Sure I were best with cap in hand to pray My sheepe be rul'd: I scorne that begging way; Paul 5 in all his conferences with the Venetians had that continually in his mouth I must be obeyed. Hist. Inter. Ven. It was the saying of Paul 5 that he was purposely set to maintaine the churches authoritie, and that hee would account it a part of his happines to dye for it. Hist. Interd. Ven.I will, I must command; they must, they shall obay. 15 Shall I, the worlds bright Sunne, heavens Oracle, The onely tongue of Gods owne mouth, shall I, Of men, of faith the Judge infallible, The rule of good, bad, wrong, and equitie, Shall I, Almighty, Rock invincible, Stoop to my servants, beg authoritie? Rome is the worlds, I Romes Head: it shall raigne: Which to effect, I live, rule, this to gaine Is here my heaven; to loose is hells tormenting paine. 16 So said, and ceas'd: while all the Priestly Round In sullen greife, and stupide silence sat: This bit his lip, that nayl'd his eye to th' ground, Some cloud their flaming eyes with scarlet hat, Some gnash't their spightfull teeth, some lowr'd, and frown'd: Till (greife and care driven out by spight and hate) Soft murmurs first gan creep along the croud: At length they storm'd, and chaf't, &amp; thundred loud, And all sad vengeance swore, and all dire mischeife vow'd. 17 So when a sable cloud with swelling sayle Comes swimming through calme skies, the silent ayre (While fierce winds sleepe in Ãol's rocky jayle) With spangled beames embroydred, glitters faire: But soone 'gins lowre and grone; straight clatt'ring hayle Fills all with noyse: Light hides his golden hayre; Earth with untimely winter's silvered. Then Loiol's eldest Sonne lifts up his head, Whom all with great applause, and silence ushered. 18 Most holy Father, Priests, Kings Soveraigne, Pope Innocent the 3 dreamed that the Lateran church at Rome was falling, but that Saint Dominick setting to his shoulders underpropt it, wherupon he confirmed his order. Who equal'st th' highest, makest lesser Gods, Though Dominick, and Loiola now sustaine The Lateran Church, with age it stoopes, and noddes: Nor have we cause to rest, or time to plaine: Rebellious earth (with heaven it selfe to oddes) Conspires to ruine our high envi'de state: Yet may wee by those artes prolong our date, Whereby wee stand; and if not chaunge, yet stay our fate. 19 When captaines strive a fort or towne to winne, They lay their batt'ry to the weakest side; Not where the wall, and guard stands thicke, but thinne: So that wise Serpent his assault appli'de, And with the weaker vessell would beginne: He first the woman with distrust and pride, Then shee the man subdues with flatt'ring lies; So in one battaile gets two victories: Our foe will teach us fight, our fall will teach us rise. 20 Our Cheife who every slight and engine knowes, Bellarmine. While on th' old troupes he spent his restles paines, With equall armes assaulting equall foes, What hath he got, or wee? What fruite, what gaines Ensu'de? we beare the losse, and he the blowes: And while each part their wit, and learning straines, The breach repaires, and (foil'd) new force assumes: Their hard encounters, and hot angry fumes Strike out the sparkling fire, which lights them, us consumes. 21 In stead of heavy armes hence use we slight: Trade we with those, which train'd in ignorance Have small acquaintance with that heavenly light; Those who disgrac't by some misgovernance (Their owne, or others) swell with griefe or spight. But nothing more our Kingdome must advance, Or further our designes, then to comply With that weake sexe, and by fine forgerie To worme in womens hearts, chiefly the rich and high. 22 Nor let the stronger scorne these weaker powres; The labour's lesse with them, the harvest more: They easier yeeld, and win; so fewer houres Are spent: for women sooner drinke our lore, Men sooner sippe it from their lippes, then ours: Sweetly they learne, and sweetly teach: with store Of teares, smiles, kisses, and ten thousand arts They lay close batt'ry to mens frayler parts: So finely steale themselves, and us into their hearts. 23 That strongest Champion, who with naked hands A Lyon tore, who all unarm'd and bound Heap't mounts of armed foes on bloody sands; By womans art, without or force or wound Subdu'de, now in a mill blind grinding stands. That Sunne of wisedome, which the Preacher crown'd Great King of arts, bewitch't with womens smiles, Fell deepe in seas of folly by their wiles. Wit, strength, and grace it selfe yeeld to their flatt'ring guiles. 24 This be our skirmish: for the maine, release The Spanish forces, free strong Belgia From feare of warre, let armes and armies cease. What got our Alva, John of Austria? Our Captaine, Guile; our weapons ease, and peace: These more prevaile then Parma, Spinola. The Dutch shall yeeld us armes, and men; there dwell Arminians, who from heaven halfe way fell: A doubtfull sect, which hang 'tween truth, lies, heaven and hell. 25 These Epicens have sowne their subtile brayne With thorny difference, and neat illusion: Proud, fierce, the adverse part they much disdaine. These must be handled soft with fine collusion, For Calvins hate to side with Rome and Spaine, To worke their owne, and their owne-homes confusion. And by large summes, more hopes, wee must bring in Wise Barnevelt to lay our plotted gin: So where the Lyon fayles, the Fox shall eas'ly win. 26 The flowres of Fraunce, those faire delicious flowres, Which late are imp't in stemme of proud Navar, With ease wee may transferre to Castile bowres. Feare not that sleeping Lyon: this I dare, And will make good spight of all envious powres, When that great bough most threats the neighb'ring ayre, Then shall he fall: when now his tho[u]ghts worke high, And in their pitch their towring p[r]ojects fly, Then shall he stoop; his hopes shall droop, and drop, &amp; dy. 27 Wee have not yet forgot the shamefull day, When forc't from Fraunce and our new holds to fly (Hooted, and chac't as owles) we ran away. That Pillar of our lasting infamy Though raz'd, yet in our minds doth freshly stay. Hence love wee that great King so heartily, That but his heart nought can our hearts content: His bleeding heart from crazy body rent, Shrin'd in bright gold shall stand our Jesuite monument. 28 This be our taske: the aged truncke wee'l lop, And force the sprigges forget their former kind: Wee'l graft the tender twigges on Spanish top, And with fast knots Fraunce unto Spaine wee'l bind, With crosse, and double knotts: wee'l still, and drop The Romane sap into their empty mind: Wee'l hold their heart, wee'l porter at their eare, The head, the feet, the hands wee'l wholy steare: That at our nod the head the heart it selfe shall teare. 29 All this a Prologue to our Tragedy: My head's in travaile of an hideous And fearfull birth; such as may fright the sky, Turne back the Sun: helpe, helpe Ignatius. And in this act proove thy new Deity. I have a plot worthy of Rome and us, Which with amazement heaven, and earth shall fill: Nor care I whether right, wrong, good, or ill: Church-profit is our law, our onely rule thy will. 30 That blessed Isle, so often curst in vaine, Triumphing in our losse and idle spight, Of force shall shortly stoop to Rome and Spayne: I'le take a way ne're knowne to man or spright. To kill a King is stale, and I disdaine: That fits a Secular, not a Jesuite. Kings, Nobles, Clergy, Commons high and low, The Flowre of England in one houre I'le mow, And head all th'Isle with one unseen, unfenced blow. 31 A goodly frame, rays'd high with carved stones, Leaning his lofty head on marble stands Close by that Temple, where the honour'd bones Of Britaine Kings and many Princely Grands Adorned rest with golden scutcheons: Garnish't with curious worke of Dedal hands. Low at his base the swelling Thamis falls, And sliding downe along those stately halls, Doth that chiefe Citie wash, and fence with liquid walls. 32 Here all the States in full assembly meet, And every order rank't in fit array, Cloth'd with rich robes fill up the crowded street. Next 'fore the King his Heier leades the way, Glitt'ring with gemmes, and royall Coronet: So golden Phosphor ushers in the day. And all the while the trumpets triumphs sound, And all the while the peoples votes resound: Their shoutes and tramplings shake the ayre and dauncing ground. 33 There in Astrea's ballaunce doe they weigh The right and wrong, reward and punishment; And rigour with soft equitie allay, Curbe lawles lust, and stablish government; There Rome it selfe, and us they dare affray With bloody lawes, and threatnings violent: Hence all our suff'rings, The printed lies concerning the torments of their Romane Martyrs which I sawe in the study of that learned Knight Sir Thomas Hutchinson priviledged by the Pope are for their monstrous impudency incredible. torments exquisite, Varied in thousand formes, appli'de to fright The harmeles yet (alas!) and spotles Jesuite. 34 But Cellars large, and cavernes vaulted deep With bending arches borne, and columnes strong Under that stately building slyly creep: Here Bacchus lyes, conceal'd from Juno's wrong, Whom those cold vaults from hot-breath'd ayers keep. In place of these wee'l other barrels throng, Stuf't with those firy sands, and black dry mould, Which from blue Phlegetons shores that Frier bold Stole with dire hand, and yet hells force and colour hold. 35 And when with numbers just the house gins swell, And every state hath fill'd his station, When now the King mounted on lofty sell, With honyed speech and comb'd oration Charm's every eare, midst of that sugred spell I'le teare the walls, blow up the nation, Bullet to heaven the stones with thunders loud, Equall to th' earth the courts, and turrets proud, And fire the shaking towne, &amp; quench't with royall blood. 36 Oh how my dauncing heart leapes in my breast But to fore-thinke that noble tragedie! I thirst, I long for that blood-royall feast. See where their lawes, see, Holy Father, see Where lawes and Makers, and above the rest Kings marshal'd in due place through th' ayer flee: There goes the heart, there th'head, there sindged bones: Heark, Father, heark; hear'st not those musicke tones? Some rore, some houle, some shriek; earth, hell, and ayer grones. 37 Thus sang, and downe he sat; while all the Quire Attune their ecchoing voices to his layes: Some Jesuite Pietie, and zealous fire, Some his deepe reaching wit, and judgement praise: And all the plot commend, and all admire, But most great Paul himselfe: a while he stayes, Then suddaine rising, with embraces long He hugges his sonne, while yet the passion strong Wanting due vent, makes teares his words, and eyes his tongue. 38 At length the heart too full his joy dispers't, Which mounting on the tongue, thus overflowes: You Romane Saints, to whose deare reliques herst In golden shrines every true Catholike bowes, And thou of lesser gods the best and first, Great English Thomas, ushering our vowes, Thomas Becket. Who giv'st heaven by thy blood, and precious merit, I see we still your love and helpe inherit, Who in our need rayse up so true a Romane spirit. 39 What meed (my Sonne) can Christ, or he above, Or I beneath, to thy deservings weigh? What heaven can recompence thy pious love? In Lateran Church thy statue crown'd with bay In gold shall mounted stand next highest Jove: To thee wee'l humbly kneele, and vowe, and pray: Haile Romes great Patron, ease our restles cares, Possesse thy heaven, and prosper our affayres, Even now inure thine eare to our religious prayers. 40 So up they rose as full of hope, as spight, And every one his charge with care applies. Equivocus with heart, and pinions light Downe posting to th'Infernall shadowes flies; Fills them with joyes, such joyes as Sonnes of night Enjoy, such as from sinne and mischiefe rise. With all they envy, greive, and inly grone To see themselves out-sinn'd: and every one Wish't he the Jesuit were, and that dire plot his owne. CANTO V. 1 Looke as a wayward child would something have, Yet flings away, wralls, spurn's, his Nurse abuses: So froward man, what most his longings crave, (Likenes to God) profer'd by God refuses: But will be rather sinnes base drudge and slave. The shade by Satan promis'd greed'ly chuses, And with it death and hell. Oh wretched state, Where not the eyes, but feete direct the gate! So misse what most we wish, and have what most we hate. 2 Thus will this man of sinne be like to Christ, A King, yet not in heaven, but earth that raignes; That murthers, saves not Christians; th' highest Preist, Yet not to wait his course, (that he disdaines) But to advaunce aloft his mitred crest; That Christ himselfe may wait upon his traynes. Straunge Priest, oft heaven he sells, but never buyes: Straunge Doctor, hating truth, enforcing lyes: Thus Satan is indeed, and Christ by contraryes. 3 And such his Ministers all glist'ring bright In night and shades, and yet but rotten wood, And fleshly Devils: such this Jesuite, Who (Loiol's Ensigne) thirsts for English blood. He culs choice soules (soules vow'd to th'Prince of night, And Priest of Rome) sweares them (an English brood, But hatch't in Rome for Spaine) close to conceale, And execute what he should then reveale: Binds them to hell in sin, &amp; makes heavens Lord the seale. 4 Now are they met; this armed with a spade, That with a mattocke, voide of shame and feare: The earth (their Grandame Earth) they fierce invade, And all her bowels search, and rent, and teare, Then by her ruines flesh't, much bolder made, They ply their worke; and now neere hell, they heare Soft voices, murmurs, doubtfull whisperings: The fearfull conscience prick't with guilty stings, A thousand hellish formes into their fancy brings. 5 This like a statue stands; cold fright congeales His marble limbes; to th' earth another falling, Creeping behind a barrell softly steales: A third into an empty hogshead cralling, Locks up his eyes, drawes in his stragling heeles: A fourth, in vaine for succour loudly calling, Flies through the aire as swift as gliding starre; Pale, ghastly, like infernall sprites afarre Each to his fellow seemes: and so, or worse they are. 6 So when in sleep's soft grave dead senses rest, An earthly vapour clamb'ring up the braine Brings in a meagre ghost, whose launched brest Showres downe his naked corps a bloody raine: A dull-blue-burning torch about his crest He ghastly waves; halfe dead with frightfull paine The leaden foot faine would, but cannot fly; The gaping mouth faine would, but cannot cry: And now awake still dreames, nor trusts his open eye: 7 At length those streames of life, which ebbing low Were all retir'd into the frighted heart, Backe to their wonted chanels gan to flow: So peeping out, yet trembling every part, And list'ning now with better heed, they know Those next adjoyning roomes hollow'd by art To lie for cellerage: which glad they hire, And cramme with powder, and unkindled fire: Slacke aged Time with plaints and praires they daily tire. 8 Slow Time, which every houre grow'st old and young, Which every minute dy'st, and liv'st againe; Which mak'st the strong man weak, the weak man strong: Sad time which fly'st in joy, but creep'st in paine, Thy steppes uneven are still too short or long: Devouring Time, who bear'st a fruitfull traine, And eat'st what er'e thou bear'st, why dost not flee, Why do'st not post to view a Tragedie, Which never time yet saw, which never time shall see? 9 Among them all none so impatient Of stay, as firy Faux, whose grisly feature Adorn'd with colours of hells regiment (Soot black, and fiery red) betrayd his nature. His frighted Mother, when her time shee went, Oft dream't she bore a straunge, &amp; monstrous creature, A brand of hell sweltring in fire and smoke, Who all, and's Mother's selfe would burne and choke: So dream't she in her sleep, so found she when she woke. 10 Rome was his Nurse, and Spaine his Tutour; she With wolvish milk flesh't him in deadly lyes, In hate of Truth, and stubborn errour: he Fats him with humane blood, inures his eyes Dash't braines, torne guts, and trembling hearts to see, And tun'de his eare with grones and shrieking cryes. Thus nurst, bred, growne a Canniball, now prest To be the leader of this troup, he blest His bloody maw with thought of such a royall feast. 11 Meane time the Eye, which needs no light to see, That wakefull Eye, which never winks or sleepes, That purest Eye, which hates iniquitie, That carefull Eye, which safe his Israel keepes, From which no word, or thought can hidden bee, Look's from his heaven, and piercing through the deepes, With hate, and scorne viewes the dire Jesuite Weary his hand, and quintessentiall wit, To weave himselfe a snare, and dig himselfe a pit. 12 That Mounting Eagle, which beneath his throne (His Saphire throne) fixed on Chrystall base, Broadly dispreds his heaven-wide pineon, On whome, when sinfull earth he strikes with 'maze, He wide displayes his black pavilion, And thundring, fires high towres with flashing blaze: Darke waters draw their sable curtaines o're him, With flaming wings the burning Angels shore him, The cloudes, &amp; guilty heavens for feare fly fast before him: 13 That mounting Eagle forth he suddaine calls, Fly, winged Herald, to that Citie fly, Whose towres my love, truth, wisedome builds and walls: There to the Councell this foule plot descry: And while thy doubtfull writ their wit appalls, That great Peace-makers sense Ile open, I Will cleere his mind, and plaine those ridling folds. So said, so done: no place or time with-holds His instant course, the towne he thinks, he sees, and holds. 14 There in another shape to that wise Peer (That wisest Peer) he gives a darksome spell: He was the states Treasure, and Treasurer, Spaines feare, but Englands earthly oracle; He Patron to my Mother Cambridge, where Thousand sweet Muses, thousand Graces dwell: But neither hee, nor humane wit could find The riddles sense, till that learn'd royall mind, Lighted from heaven, soone the knot, and plot untwin'd. 15 And now the fatall Morne approached neare: The Sunne, and every starre had quench't their light, Loathing so black a deed: the Articke Beare Enjoyn'd to stay, trembling at such a sight, Though drench't in ayrie seas, yet wink't for feare. But hellish Faux laught at blinde heavens affright. What? Such a deed not seen? In vaine (saith he) You drowne your lights; if heaven envious be, I'le bring hell fires for light, that all the world may see. 16 So entring in, reviewes th'infernall mines; Marshals his casks anew, and ord'ring right The tragicke Scene, his hellish worke refines: And now return'd, booted, and drest for flight, A watchfull Swaine the Miner undermines, Holds, binds, brings out the Plot to view the light; The world amaz'd, hel yawn'd, earth gap't, heaven star'd, Rome howl'd to see long hopes so sudden mar'd: The net was set, the fowle escap't, the fowler snar'd. 17 Oh thou great Shepheard, Earths, Heavens Soveraigne, Whom we thy pasture-sheep admire, adore; See all thy flocks prostrate on Britaine plaine, Pluck't from the slaughter; fill their mouthes with store Of incens't praise: oh see, see every swaine 'Maz'd with thy workes; much 'maz'd, but ravish't more: Powre out their hearts thy glorious name to raise; Fire thou our zealous lippes with thankfull laies; Make this sav'd Isle to burne in love, to smoke in praise. 18 Teach me thy groome, here dull'd in fenny mire, In these sweet layes, oh teach me beare a part: Oh thou dread Spirit shed thy heavenly fire, Thy holy flame into this frozen heart: Teach thou my creeping Muse to heaven aspire, Learne my rude brest, learne me that sacred art, Which once thou taught'st thy Israels shepheard-King: O raise my soft veine to high thundering; Tune thou my lofty song, thy glory would I sing. 19 Thou liv'dst before, beyond, without all time; Art held in none, yet fillest every place: Ah, how (alas!) how then shall mortall slime With sinfull eyes view that eternall space, Or comprehend thy name in measur'd rime? To see forth-right the eie was set i' th' face, Hence, infinite to come I wel descry, Past infinite no creature sees with eie: Onely th'Eternall's selfe measures eternitie. 20 And yet by thee, to thee all live and move; Thou without place or time giv'st times and places: The heavens (thy throne) thou liftest all above, Which folded in their mixt, but pure embraces Teach us in their conjunctions chastest love, Next to the Earth the Moone performes her races; Then Mercury; beyond, the Phosphor bright: These with their friendly heat, and kindly might, Warme pallid Cynthia's cold, and draine her watry light. 21 Farre thou remoov'st slow Saturn's frosty drythe, And thaw'st his yce with Mars his flaming ire: Betwixt them Jove by thy appointment fly'th; Who part's, and temper's well his Sonne and Sire; His moist flames dull the edge of Saturnes sithe, And ayry moisture softens Mars his fire. The Heart of heaven midst of heavens bodie rides, From whose full sea of light and springing tides The lesser streames of light fill up their empty sides. 22 The Virgin Earth, all in green-silken weed (Embroyder'd fayre with thousand flowres) arrayd: Whose wombe untill'd knew yet nor plough, nor seed, Nor midwifry of man, nor heavens ayd, Amaz'd to see her num'rous Virgin breed, Her fruit even fruitfull, yet her selfe a mayd: The earth of all the low'st, yet middle lies; Nor sinks, though loosely hang'd in liquid skies: For rising were her fall; and falling were her rise. 23 Next Earth the Sea a testy neighbour raves, Which casting mounts, and many a churlish hill, Discharges 'gainst her walles his thundring waves, Which all the shores with noyse and tumult fill: But all in vaine; thou beat'st downe all his braves; When thee he heares commanding, Peace, be still, Downe straight he lowly falls, disbands his traynes, Sinks in himselfe, and all his mountaines playnes, Soft peace in all the shores, and quiet stillnes raygnes. 24 Thou mad'st the circling ayre aloft to fly, And all this Round infold at thy command; So thinne, it never could be seen with eye, So grosse, it may be felt with every hand. Next to the horned Moon and neighbour sky, The fire thou highest bad'st, but farthest stand. Straungely thou temper'st their adverse affection: Though still they hate and fight, by thy direction Their strife maintaines their owne, and all the worlds perfection. 25 For Earth's cold arme cold Winter friendly holds; But with his dry the others wet defies: The Ayer's warmth detests the Water's colds; But both a common moisture joyntly ties: Warme Ayre with mutuall love hot Fire infolds; As moist, his drythe abhorres: drythe Earth allies To Fire, but heats with cold new warres addresse: Thus by their peacefull fight, and fighting peace All creatures grow, and dye, and dying still increase. 26 Above them all thou sit'st, who gav'st all being, All every where, in all, and over all: Thou their great Umpire, all their strife agreeing, Bend'st [t]heir stiffe natures to thy soveraigne call: Thine eye their law: their steppes by overseeing Thou overrul'st, and keep'st from slipp'ry fall. Oh if thy steady hand should not maintaine What first it made, all straight would fall againe, And nothing of this All, save nothing would remaine. 27 Thou bid'st the Sunne piece out the ling'ring day, Glitt'ring in golden fleece: The lovely Spring Comes dauncing on; the Primrose strewes her way, And satten Violet: Lambs wantoning Bound o're the hillocks in their sportfull play: The wood-musicians chant and cheerely sing; The World seemes new, yet old by youths accruing. Ah wretched men, so wretched world pursuing, Which still growes worse with age, and older by renuing! 28 At thy command th'Earth travailes of her fruit; The Sunne yeelds longer labour, shorter sleep; Out-runnes the Lyon in his hot pursuit; Then of the golden Crab learnes backe to creep: Thou Autumne bid'st (drest in straw-yellow suit) To presse, tunne, hide his grapes in cellars deep: Thou cloth'st the Earth with freez in stead of grasse, While keen-breath'd winter steeles her furrow'd face, And vials rivers up, and seas in Chrystall glasse. 29 What, but thy love and thou, which feele no change? Seas fill, and want: their waters fall, and grow; The windy aire each houre can wildly range; Earth lives, and dies; heavens lights can ebbe, and flow: Thy Spowse her selfe, while yet a Pilgrim strange, Treading this weary world (like Cynthia's bow) Now full of glorious beames, and sparkling light; Then soone oppos'd, eclips't with earthly spight Seemes drown'd in sable clouds, buried in endles night. 30 See, Lord, ah see thy rancorous enemies Blowne up with envious spight, but more with hate, Like boisterous windes, and Seas high-working, rise: So earthly fires, wrapt up in watry night, With dire approach invade the glistring skies. And bid the Sunne put out his sparkling light; See Lord, unles thy right hand even steares Oh if thou anchour not these threatning feares, Thy Ark will sayle as deepe in blood, as now in teares. 31 That cursed Beast, (which with thy Princely hornes, With all thy stiles, and high prerogatives His carrion cor's and Serpents head adornes) His croaking Frogges to every quarter drives: See how the key of that deep pit he tournes, And cluck's his Locusts from their smoky hives: See how they rise, and with their numerous swarmes Filling the world with fogges, and fierce alarmes, Bury the earth with bloodles corps, and bloody armes. 32 The bastard Sonne of that old Dragon (red With blood of Saints) and all his petty states; That triple monster, Geryon, who bred, Nurs't, flesh't in blood thy servants deadly hates, And that seduced Prince who hath his head Eyes, eares, and tongue all in the Jesuite pates; All these, and hundred Kings, and nations, drunk With whorish Cup of that dire witch and punk, Have sworne to see thy Church in death for ever sunk. 33 Now from those hel-hounds turne thy glorious eyes; See, see thy fainting Spouse swimme, sinke in teares: Heare Lord, oh heare her grones, and shrieking cries: Those eyes long wait for thee: Lord to thine eares She brings heart, lips, a Turtle sacrifice. Thy cursed foe that Pro-Christ trophies reares: How long (just Lord) how long wilt thou delay That drunken whore with blood and fire to pay? Thy Saints, thy truth, thy name's blasphem'd; how canst thou stay? 34 Oh is not this the time, when mounted high Revel. 19. 11. 12. 13. 14. Upon thy Pegasus of heavenly breed, Revel. 14. 20. With bloody armes, white armies, flaming eye, Thou vow'st in blood to swimme thy snowy steed; And staine thy bridle with a purple dye? This, this thy time; come then, oh come with speed, Such as thy Israel saw thee, when the maine Pil'd up his waves on heapes; the liquid plaine Ran up, and with his hill safe wall'd that wandring traine. 35 Such as we saw thee late, when spanish braves (Preventing fight with printed victorie) Full fraught with brands, whips, gyves for English slaves, Blest by their Lord God Pope, thine enemie, Turn'd seas to woods; thou arm'd with fires, winds, waves, Fround'st on their pride: they feare, they faint, they fly: Some sink in drinking seas, or drunken sand, Some yeeld, some dash on rocks; the Spanish Grand Banquets the fish in seas, or foules, and dogs on land. 36 Oh when wilt thou unlock the seeled eyes Of those ten hornes, and Kings, which with the Beast Revel. 17. 12. 13. 16. (Yet by thy hand) 'gan first to swell and rise? How long shall they (charm'd with her drunken feast) Give her their crownes? Bewitch't with painted lies, They dreame thy spirit breathes from her sug'red breast, Thy Sun burnes with her eye-reflected beames, From her life, light, all grace, and glory streames. Wake these enchaunted sleepes, shake out these hellish dreames. 37 Wake lesser Gods, you sacred Deputies Of heavens King, awake: see, see the light Bares that foule whore, dispells her sorceries, Blanch't skin, dead lippes, sowre breath, splay foot, owl-sight. Ah can you dote on such deformities? While you will serve in crownes, and beg your right, Pray, give, fill up her never fill'd desire, You her white Sonnes: else knives, dags, death your hire. Scorne this base yoke; strip, eat, and burne her flesh in fire. Revel. 17. 16. 38 But thou, Greate Prince, in whose successefull raigne, Thy Britanes 'gin renue their Martiall fame, Our Soveraigne Lord, our joy more Soveraigne, Our onely Charles, under whose ominous name Rome wounded first, still pines in ling'ring paine; Thou who hast seen, and loath'd Romes whorish shame, Rouse those brave Sparkes, which in thy bosome swell, Cast downe this second Lucifer to hell: So shalt thou all thy Sires, so shalt' thy selfe excell. 39 'Tis not in vaine, that Christ hath girt thy head With three fayre peacefull Crownes: 'tis not in vaine, That in thy Realmes such spirits are dayly bred, Which thirst, and long to tug with Rome, and Spayne: Thy royall Sire to Kings this lecture red; This, this deserv'd his pen, and learned veine: Here, noble Charles, enter thy chevalrie; The Eagle scornes at lesser game to flie; Onely this warre's a match worthy thy Realmes, &amp; Thee. 40 Ah happy man, that lives to see that day! Ah happy man, who in that warre shall bleed! Happy who beares the standard in that fray! Happy who quells that rising Babel seed! Thrice happy who that whore shall doubly pay! This (royall Charles) this be thy happy meed. Mayst thou that triple diademe trample downe, This shall thy name in earth, and heaven renowne, And adde to these three here there a thrice triple crowne. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Volume II THE PURPLE ISLAND, OR THE ISLE OF MAN: TOGETHER WITH PISCATORIE ECLOGS AND OTHER POETICALL MISCELLANIES. TO MY MOST WORTHY AND LEARNED FRIEND, EDWARD BENLOWES ESQUIRE. COMMENDATORY VERSES ON THE EXCELLENT MORALL POEM, ENTITULED THE ISLE OF MAN. Lord! how my youth with this vain world hath err'd, Applauding theirs as th' onely happy fate, Whom to some Empire bloud, choice, chance preferr'd, Or who of learned arts could wisely prate; Or travelling the world, had well conferr'd Mens natures with the mysteries of state! But now thy wiser Muse hath taught me this, That these and most men else do aim at blisse; But these and most men else do take their aim amisse. Reigne o're the world, not o're this Isle of Man, Worse then a slave, thou thine own slaves obey'st. Study all arts devis'd since time began, And not thy self, thou studiest not, but play'st. Out-travell wise Ulysses, (if you can) Yet misse this Isle, thou travell'st not, but stray'st. Let me (O Lord) but reigne o're mine own heart, And master be of this self-knowing art, I'le dwell in th' Isle of Man, ne're travell forrain part. E. Benlowes. E. Benevolus. TO THE LEARNED AUTHOUR, SONNE AND BROTHER TO two judicious Poets, himself the third, not second to either. Grave Father of this Muse, thou deem'st too light To wear thy name, 'cause of thy youthfull brain It seems a sportfull childe; resembling right Thy wittie childehood, not thy graver strain, Which now esteems these works of fancie vain. Let not thy childe, thee living, orphan be; Who when th' art dead, will give a life to thee. How many barren wits would gladly own, How few o'th' pregnantest own such another! Thou Father art, yet blushest to be known; And though 't may call the best of Muses Mother, Yet thy severer judgement would it smother. O judge not Thou, let Readers judge thy book: Such Cates should rather please the Guest, then Cook. O but thou fear'st't will stain the reverend gown Thou wearest now; nay then fear not to show it: For were't a stain, 't were natures, not thine own: For thou art Poet born; who know thee, know it: Thy brother, sire, thy very name's a Poet. Thy very name will make these PoÃ«ms take, These very PoÃ«ms else thy name will make. W. Benlowes. TO THE INGENIOUS COMPOSER OF THIS PASTORALL, THE Spencer of this age. I vow (sweet stranger) if my lazie quill Had not been disobedient to fulfill My quick desires, this glory which is thine, Had but the Muses pleased, had been mine. My Genius jumpt with thine; the very same Was our Foundation: in the very Frame Thy Genius jumpt with mine; it got the start In nothing, but Prioritie, and Art. If (my ingenious Rivall) these dull times Should want the present strength to prize thy rhymes, The time-instructed children of the next Shall fill thy margent, and admire the text; Whose well read lines will teach them how to be The happie knowers of themselves and thee. Fran. Quarles. TO THE UNKNOWN Mr P. F. UPON SURVAY of his ISLE OF MAN. Renowned Authour, let it not seem strange A Merchants eye should thus thy Island range: It is a Merchants progresse to surround The earth, and seek out undiscover'd ground. What though my foot hath trod the fourefold shore? And eyes survaid their subdivided store? Yet rarer wonders in this Isle of thine I view'd this day, then in twice six yeares time. Justly didst thou, great Macedo, repine That thou could'st adde no other world to thine. He is not truely great, nor stout, who can Curb the great world, and not the lesser, Man. And Americus. thou whose name the Western world impos'd Upon it self, first by thy skill disclos'd; Yet is thy skill by this farre overcome, Who hath descri'd an unknown World at home: A World, which to search out, subdue, and till, Is the best object of mans wit, strength, skill: A World, where all may dangerlesse obtain Without long travell, cheapest, greatest gain. Lod. Roberts. ON THE MOST ACCURATE POEM, INSCRIBED THE PURPLE ISLAND. Henceforth let wandring Delos cease to boast Herself the God of Learnings dearest coast; And let that double-headed mountain hallow No more the honour'd name of great Apollo: And may the Pegasean spring, that uses To cheer the palats of the thirstie Muses, Drie up: and let this happie Isle of thine Preserve Apolloes harp; where every line Carries a Suada with't, and doth display The banners of heav'n-born Urania. Henceforth let all the world thy verse admire Before that Thracean Orpheus charming lyre: He but enchanted Beasts, but thy divine And higher aires bring Deities to this Isle of thine. A. C. [Mans Bodie's like a house: his greater bones] Mans Bodie's like a house: his greater bones Are the main timber; and the lesser ones Are smaller splints: his ribs are laths, daub'd o're, Plaister'd with flesh, and bloud: his mouth's the doore, His throat's the narrow entrie, and his heart Is the great chamber, full of curious art: His midriffe is a large partition-wall 'Twixt the great chamber, and the spacious hall: His stomack is the kitchin, where the meat Is often but half sod, for want of heat: His splene's a vessell nature does allot To take the skumme that rises from the pot: His lungs are like the bellows, that respire In ev'ry office, quickning ev'ry fire: His nose the chimney is, whereby are vented Such fumes as with the bellows are augmented: His bowels are the sink, whose part's to drein All noisome filth, and keep the kitchin clean: His eyes are crystall windows, cleare and bright; Let in the object, and let out the sight. And as the timber is or great, or small, Or strong, or weak, 'tis apt to stand, or fall: Yet is the likeliest building sometimes known To fall by obvious chances; overthrown Ofttimes by tempests, by the full-mouth'd blasts Of heav'n; sometimes by fire; sometimes it wastes Through unadvis'd neglect: put case the stuffe Were ruine-proofe, by nature strong enough To conquer time, and age; put case it should Ne're know an end, alas our leases would. What hast thou then, proud flesh and bloud, to boast? Thy dayes are evil, at best; but few, at most; But sad, at merriest; and but weak, at strongest; Unsure, at surest; and but short, at longest. Fran. Quarles. THE PURPLE ISLAND, OR THE ISLE OF MAN. CANT. I. 1 The warmer Sun the golden Bull outran, And with the Twins made haste to inne and play: Scatt'ring ten thousand flowres, he new began To paint the world, and piece the length'ning day: (The world more aged by new youths accrewing) Ah wretched man this wretched world pursuing, Which still grows worse by age, &amp; older by renewing! 2 The shepherd-boyes, who with the Muses dwell, Met in the plain their May-lords new to chuse, (For two they yearely chuse) to order well Their rurall sports, and yeare that next ensues: Now were they sat, where by the orchyard walls The learned Chame with stealing water crawls, And lowly down before that royall temple falls. 3 Among the rout they take two gentle swains, Whose sprouting youth did now but greenly bud: Well could they pipe and sing; but yet their strains Were onely known unto the silent wood: Their nearest bloud from self-same fountains flow, Their souls self-same in nearer love did grow: So seem'd two joyn'd in one, or one disjoyn'd in two. 4 Now when the shepherd-lads with common voice Their first consent had firmly ratifi'd, A gentle boy thus 'gan to wave their choice; Thirsil, (said he) though yet thy Muse untri'd Hath onely learn'd in private shades to feigne Soft sighs of love unto a looser strain, Or thy poore Thelgons wrong in mournfull verse to plain; 5 Yet since the shepherd-swains do all consent To make thee lord of them, and of their art; And that choice lad (to give a full content) Hath joyn'd with thee in office, as in heart; Wake, wake thy long- (thy too long) sleeping Muse, And thank them with a song, as is the use: Such honour thus conferr'd thou mayst not well refuse. 6 Sing what thou list, be it of Cupids spite, (Ah lovely spite, and spitefull lovelinesse!) Or Gemma's grief, if sadder be thy sprite: Begin, thou loved swain, with good successe. Ah, (said the bashfull boy) such wanton toyes A better minde and sacred vow destroyes, Since in a higher love I setled all my joyes. 7 New light new love, new love new life hath bred; A life that lives by love, and loves by light: A love to him, to whom all loves are wed; A light, to whom the Sunne is darkest night: Eyes light, hearts love, souls onely life he is: Life, soul, love, heart, light, eye, and all are his: He eye, light, heart, love, soul; he all my joy, &amp; blisse. 8 But if you deigne my ruder pipe to heare, (Rude pipe, unus'd, untun'd, unworthy hearing) These infantine beginnings gently bear, Whose best desert and hope must be your bearing. But you, O Muses, by soft Chamus sitting, (Your daintie songs unto his murmures fitting, Which bears the under-song unto your chearfull dittying;) 9 Tell me, ye Muses, what our father-ages Have left succeeding times to play upon: What now remains unthought on by those Sages, Where a new Muse may trie her pineon? What lightning Heroes, like great Peleus heir, (Darting his beams through our hard-frozen aire) May stirre up gentle heat, and vertues wane repair? 10 Who knows not Jason? or bold Tiphys hand, That durst unite what Natures self would part? He makes Isles continent, and all one land; O're seas, as earth, he march'd with dangerous art: He rides the white-mouth'd waves, and scorneth all Those thousand deaths wide gaping for his fall: He death defies, fenc't with a thin, low, wooden wall. 11 Who ha's not often read Troyes twice-sung fires, And at the second time twice better sung? Who ha's not heard th' Arcadian shepherds quires, Which now have gladly chang'd their native tongue; And sitting by slow Mincius, sport their fill, With sweeter voice and never-equall'd skill, Chaunting their amorous layes unto a Romane quill? 12 And thou, choice wit, Loves scholar, and Loves master, Art known to all, where Love himself is known: Whether thou bidd'st Ulysses hie him faster, Or dost thy fault and distant exile moan. Who ha's not seen upon the mourning stage Dire Atreus feast, and wrong'd Medea's rage, Marching in tragick state, and buskin'd equipage? 13 And now of late Sannazar. th' Italian fisher-swain Sits on the shore to watch his trembling line; There teaches rocks and prouder seas to plain By Nesis fair, and fairer Mergiline: While his thinne net, upon his oars twin'd, With wanton strife catches the Sunne, and winde, Which still do slip away, and still remain behinde. 14 And that Bartas. French Muses eagle eye and wing Hath soar'd to heav'n, and there hath learn'd the art To frame Angelick strains, and canzons sing Too high and deep for every shallow heart. Ah blessed soul! in those celestiall rayes, Which gave thee light these lower works to blaze, Thou sitt'st emparadis'd, and chaunt'st eternall layes. 15 Thrice happy wits, which in your springing May (Warm'd with the Sunne of well deserved favours) Disclose your buds, and your fair blooms display, Perfume the aire with your rich fragrant savours! Nor may, nor ever shall those honour'd flowers Be spoil'd by summers heat, or winters showers; But last when eating time shal gnaw the proudest towers. 16 Happy, thrice happy times in silver age! When generous plants advanc't their lofty crest; When honour stoopt to be learn'd wisdomes page; When baser weeds starv'd in their frozen nest; When th' highest flying Muse still highest climbes; And vertues rise keeps down all rising crimes. Happy, thrice happy age! happy, thrice happy times! 17 But wretched we, to whom these iron daies (Hard daies) afford nor matter, nor reward! Sings Maro? men deride high Maro's layes; Their hearts with lead, with steel their sense is barr'd: Sing Linus, or his father, as he uses, Our Midas eares their well tun'd verse refuses. What cares an asse for arts? he brayes at sacred Muses. 18 But if fond Bavius vent his clowted song, Or MÃ¦vius chaunt his thoughts in brothell charm; The witlesse vulgar, in a numerous throng, Like summer flies about their dunghills swarm: They sneer, they grinne. Like to his like will move. Yet never let them greater mischief prove Then this, Who hates not one, may he the other love. 19 Witnesse our Spencer. Colin; whom though all the Graces, And all the Muses nurst; whose well taught song Parnassus self, and Glorian embraces, And all the learn'd, and all the shepherds throng; Yet all his hopes were crost, all suits deni'd; Discourag'd, scorn'd, his writings vilifi'd: Poorly (poore man) he liv'd; poorly (poore man) he di'd. 20 And had not that great Hart, (whose honour'd head Ah lies full low) piti'd thy wofull plight; There hadst thou lien unwept, unburied, Unblest, nor grac't with any common rite: Yet shalt thou live, when thy great foe shall sink Beneath his mountain tombe, whose fame shall stink; And time his blacker name shall blurre with blackest ink. 21 O let th'Iambick Muse revenge that wrong, Which cannot slumber in thy sheets of lead: Let thy abused honour crie as long As there be quills to write, or eyes to reade: On his rank name let thine own votes be turn'd, Oh may that man that hath the Muses scorn'd, Alive, nor dead, be ever of a Muse adorn'd! 22 Oft therefore have I chid my tender Muse; Oft my chill breast beats off her fluttering wing: Yet when new spring her gentle rayes infuse, All storms are laid, I 'gin to chirp and sing: At length soft fires disperst in every vein, Yeeld open passage to the thronging train, And swelling numbers tide rolls like the surging main. 23 So where fair Thames, and crooked Isis sonne Payes tribute to his King, the mantling stream Encounter'd by the tides (now rushing on With equall force) of's way doth doubtfull seem; At length the full-grown sea, and waters King Chide the bold waves with hollow murmuring: Back flie the streams to shroud them in their mother spring. 24 Yet thou sweet numerous Muse, why should'st thou droop That every vulgar eare thy musick scorns? Nor can they rise, nor thou so low canst stoop; No seed of heav'n takes root in mud or thorns. When owls or crows, imping their flaggy wing With thy stoln plumes, their notes through th' ayer fling; Oh shame! They howl &amp; croke, while fond they strain to sing. 25 Enough for thee in heav'n to build thy nest; (Farre be dull thoughts of winning dunghill praise) Enough, if Kings enthrone thee in their breast, And crown their golden crowns with higher baies: Enough that those who weare the crown of Kings (Great Israels Princes) strike thy sweetest strings: Heav'ns Dove when high'st he flies, flies with thy heav'nly wings. 26 Let others trust the seas, dare death and hell, Search either Inde, vaunt of their scarres and wounds; Let others their deare breath (nay silence) sell To fools, and (swoln, not rich) stretch out their bounds By spoiling those that live, and wronging dead; That they may drink in pearl, and couch their head In soft, but sleeplesse down; in rich, but restlesse bed. 27 Oh let them in their gold quaffe dropsies down; Oh let them surfets feast in silver bright: While sugar hires the taste the brain to drown, And bribes of sauce corrupt false appetite, His masters rest, health, heart, life, soul to sell. Thus plentie, fulnesse, sicknesse, ring their knell: Death weds and beds them; first in grave, and then in hell. 28 But (ah!) let me under some Kentish hill Neare rowling Medway 'mong my shepherd peers, With fearlesse merrie-make, and piping still, Securely passe my few and slow-pac'd yeares: While yet the great Augustus of our nation Shuts up old Janus in this long cessation, Strength'ning our pleasing ease, and gives us sure vacation. 29 There may I, master of a little flock, Feed my poore lambes, and often change their fare: My lovely mate shall tend my sparing stock, And nurse my little ones with pleasing care; Whose love and look shall speak their father plain. Health be my feast, heav'n hope, content my gain: So in my little house my lesser heart shall reigne. 30 The beech shall yeeld a cool safe canopie, While down I sit, and chaunt to th' echoing wood: Ah singing might I live, and singing die! So by fair Thames, or silver Medwayes floud, The dying swan, when yeares her temples pierce, In musick strains breathes out her life and verse; And chaunting her own dirge tides on her watry herse. 31 What shall I then need seek a patron out, Or begge a favour from a mistris eyes, To fence my song against the vulgar rout, Or shine upon me with her Geminies? What care I, if they praise my slender song? Or reck I, if they do me right, or wrong? A shepherds blisse nor stands nor falls to ev'ry tongue. 32 Great prince of shepherds, then thy heav'ns more high, Low as our earth, here serving, ruling there; Who taught'st our death to live, thy life to die; Who when we broke thy bonds, our bonds would'st bear; Who reignedst in thy heav'n, yet felt'st our hell; Who (God) bought'st man, whom man (though God) did sell; Who in our flesh, our graves, (and worse) our hearts would'st dwell: 33 Great Prince of shepherds, thou who late didst deigne To lodge thy self within this wretched breast, (Most wretched breast such guest to entertain, Yet oh most happy lodge in such a guest!) Thou first and last, inspire thy sacred skill; Guide thou my hand, grace thou my artlesse quill: So shall I first begin, so last shall end thy will. 34 Heark then, ah heark, you gentle shepheard-crue; An Isle I fain would sing, an Island fair; A place too seldome view'd, yet still in view; Neare as our selves, yet farthest from our care; Which we by leaving finde, by seeking lost; A forrain home, a strange, though native coast; Most obvious to all, yet most unknown to most: 35 CoÃ«vall with the world in her nativitie: Which though it now hath pass'd through many ages, And still retain'd a naturall proclivitie To ruine, compast with a thousand rages Of foe-mens spite, which still this Island tosses; Yet ever grows more prosp'rous by her crosses; By with'ring springing fresh, and rich by often losses. 36 Vain men, too fondly wise, who plough the seas, With dangerous pains another earth to finde; Adding new worlds to th' old, and scorning ease, The earths vast limits dayly more unbinde! The aged world, though now it falling shows, And hastes to set, yet still in dying grows. Whole lives are spent to win, what one deaths houre must lose. 37 How like's the world unto a tragick stage! Where every changing scene the actours change; Some subject crouch and fawn; some reigne and rage: And new strange plots brings scenes as new &amp; strange, Till most are slain; the rest their parts have done: So here; some laugh and play; some weep and grone; Till all put of their robes, and stage and actours gone. 38 Yet this fair Isle, sited so nearely neare, That from our sides nor place nor time may sever; Though to your selves your selves are not more deare, Yet with strange carelesnesse you travell never: Thus while your selves and native home forgetting, You search farre distant worlds with needlesse sweating, You never finde your selves; so lose ye more by getting. 39 When that great Power, that All, farre more then all, (When now his fore-set time was fully come) Brought into act this undigested Ball, Which in himself till then had onely room; He labour'd not, nor suffer'd pain, or ill; But bid each kinde their severall places fill: He bid, and they obey'd; their action was his will. 40 First stepp'd the Light, and spread his chearfull rayes Through all the Chaos; darknesse headlong fell, Frighted with suddain beams, and new-born dayes; And plung'd her ougly head in deepest hell: Not that he meant to help his feeble sight To frame the rest, he made the day of night: All els but darknesse; he the true, the onely Light. 41 Fire, Water, Earth, and Aire (that fiercely strove) His soveraigne hand in strong alliance ti'd, Binding their deadly hate in constant love: So that great Wisdome temper'd all their pride, (Commanding strife and love should never cease) That by their peacefull fight, and fighting peace, The world might die to live, and lessen to increase. 42 Thus Earths cold arm cold Water friendly holds, But with his drie the others wet defies: Warm Aire with mutuall love hot Fire infolds; As moist, his dryth abhorres: drie Earth allies With Fire, but heats with cold new warres prepare: Yet Earth drencht Water proves, which boil'd turns Aire; Hot Aire makes Fire: condenst all change, and home repair. 43 Now when the first weeks life was almost spent, And this world built, and richly furnished; To store heav'ns courts, and steer earths regiment, He cast to frame an Isle, the heart and head Of all his works, compos'd with curious art; Which like an Index briefly should impart The summe of all; the whole, yet of the whole a part 44 That Trine-one with himself in councell sits, And purple dust takes from the new-born earth; Part circular, and part triang'lar fits, Endows it largely at the unborn birth, Deputes his Favorite Vice-roy; doth invest With aptnesse thereunto, as seem'd him best; And lov'd it more then all, and more then all it blest. 45 Then plac't it in the calm pacifick seas, And bid nor waves, nor troublous windes offend it; Then peopled it with subjects apt to please So wise a Prince, made able to defend it Against all outward force, or inward spite; Him framing like himself, all shining bright; A little living Sunne, Sonne of the living Light. 46 Nor made he this like other Isles; but gave it Vigour, sence, reason, and a perfect motion, To move it self whither it self would have it, And know what falls within the verge of notion: No time might change it, but as ages went, So still return'd; still spending, never spent; More rising in their fall, more rich in detriment. 47 So once the Delos. Cradle of that double light, Whereof one rules the night, the other day, (Till sad Latona flying Juno's spite, Her double burthen there did safely lay) Not rooted yet, in every sea was roving, With every wave, and every winde removing; But since to those fair Twins hath left her ever moving. 48 Look as a scholar, who doth closely gather Many large volumes in a narrow place; So that great Wisdome all this All together Confin'd into this Islands little space; And being one, soon into two he fram'd it; And now made two, to one again reclaim'd it; The little Isle of Man, or Purple Island nam'd it. 49 Thrice happy was the worlds first infancie, Nor knowing yet, nor curious ill to know: Joy without grief, love without jealousie: None felt hard labour, or the sweating plough: The willing earth brought tribute to her King; Bacchus unborn lay hidden in the cling Of big-swoln grapes; their drink was every silver spring. 50 Of all the windes there was no difference: None knew mild Zephyres from cold Eurus mouth; Nor Orithyia's lovers violence Distinguisht from the ever-dropping South: But either gentle West-winds reign'd alone, Or else no winde, or harmfull winde was none: But one winde was in all, and all the windes in one. 51 None knew the sea; (oh blessed ignorance!) None nam'd the stars, the North carres constant race, Taurus bright horns, or Fishes happy chance: AstrÃ¦a yet chang'd not her name or place; Her ev'n-pois'd ballance heav'n yet never tri'd: None sought new coasts, nor forrain lands descri'd; But in their own they liv'd, and in their own they di'd. 52 But (ah!) what liveth long in happinesse? Grief, of an heavy nature, steddy lies, And cannot be remov'd for weightinesse; But joy, of lighter presence, eas'ly flies, And seldome comes, and soon away will goe: Some secret power here all things orders so, That for a sun-shine day follows an age of woe. 53 Witnesse this glorious Isle, which not content To be confin'd in bounds of happinesse, Would trie what e're is in the continent; And seek out ill, and search for wretchednesse. Ah fond, to seek what then was in thy will! That needs no curious search; 'tis next us still. 'Tis grief to know of grief, and ill to know of ill. 54 That old slie Serpent, (slie, but spitefull more) Vext with the glory of this happy Isle, Allures it subt'ly from the peacefull shore, And with fair painted lies, &amp; colour'd guile Drench'd in Mare mortuum. dead seas; whose dark streams, full of fright, Emptie their sulphur waves in endlesse night; Where thousand deaths and hells torment the damned sprite. 55 So when a fisher-swain by chance hath spi'd A big-grown Pike pursue the lesser frie, He sets a withy Labyrinth beside, And with fair baits allures his nimble eye; Which he invading with out-stretched finne, All suddainly is compast with the ginne, Where there is no way out, but easie passage in. 56 That deathfull lake hath these three properties; No turning path, or issue thence is found: The captive never dead, yet ever dies; It endlesse sinks, yet never comes to ground: Hells self is pictur'd in that brimstone wave; For what retiring from that hellish grave? Or who can end in death, where deaths no ending have? 57 For ever had this Isle in that foul ditch With curelesse grief and endlesse errour strai'd, Boyling in sulphur, and hot-bubbling pitch; Had not the King, whose laws he (fool) betrai'd, Unsnarl'd that chain, then from that lake secur'd; For which ten thousand tortures he endur'd: So hard was this lost Isle, so hard to be recur'd. 58 O thou deep well of life, wide stream of love, (More deep, more wide then widest deepest seas) Who dying Death to endlesse death didst prove, To work this wilfull-rebell Islands ease; Thy love no time began, no time decaies; But still increaseth with decreasing daies: Where then may we begin, where may we end thy praise? 59 My callow wing, that newly left the nest, How can it make so high a towring flight? O depth without a depth! in humble breast With praises I admire so wondrous height. But thou, my A book called Christs Victorie and Triumph. sister Muse, mayst well go higher, And end thy flight; ne're may thy pineons tire: Thereto may he his grace and gentle heat aspire. 60 Then let me end my easier taken storie, And sing this Islands new recover'd seat. But see, the eye of noon, in brightest glorie, (Teaching great men) is ne're so little great: Our panting flocks retire into the glade; They crouch, and close to th' earth their horns have laid: Vail we our scorched heads in that thick beeches shade. CANT. II. 1 Declining PhÅbus, as he larger grows, (Taxing proud folly) gentler waxeth still; Never lesse fierce, then when he greatest shows; When Thirsil on a gentle rising hill (Where all his flock he round might feeding view) Sits down, and circled with a lovely crue Of Nymphs &amp; shepherd-boyes, thus 'gan his song renew: 2 Now was this Isle pull'd from that horrid main, Which bears the fearfull looks and name of death; And setled new with bloud and dreadfull pain, By him who twice had giv'n (once forfeit) breath: A baser state then what was first assign'd; Wherein (to curb the too aspiring minde) The better things were lost, the worst were left behinde. 3 That glorious image of himself was raz'd; Ah! scarce the place of that best part we finde: And that bright Sun-like knowledge much defac'd, Onely some twinkling starres remain behinde: Then mortall made; yet as one fainting dies, Two other in its place succeeding rise; And drooping stock with branches fresh immortalize. 4 So that 'lone bird in fruitfull Arabie, When now her strength and waning life decaies, Upon some airie rock, or mountain high, In spiced bed (fir'd by neare PhÅbus rayes) Her self and all her crooked age consumes: Straight from the ashes and those rich perfumes A new-born PhÅnix flies, &amp; widow'd place resumes. 5 It grounded lies upon a sure The foundation of the body is the bones. Bones are a similar part of the body, most dry, or cold; made by the vertue generative, through heat of the thicker portion of seed, which is most earthy and fat for the establishment and figure of the whole. foundation, Compact, and hard; whose matter (cold and drie) To marble turns in strongest congelation; Fram'd of fat earth, which fires together tie: Through all the Isle, and every part extent, To give just form to every regiment; Imparting to each part due strength and stablishment. 6 A cartilage, or grisle, is of a middle nature betwixt bones, and ligaments or sinews, made of the same matter, and in the same manner as bones, for variety and safetie in motion.Whose looser ends are glu'd with brother earth, Of nature like, and of a neare relation; Of self-same parents both, at self-same birth; Some of these (even as bones) sustain and uphold some parts.That oft it self stands for a good foundation: Both these are knit with ligaments: A ligament or sinew is of nature between grisles, and nerves, framed of a tough and clammy portion of the seed, for knitting &amp; holding the bones together, &amp; fitting them for motion.Both these a third doth soulder fast, and binde; Softer then both, yet of the self-same kinde; All instruments of motion, in one league combin'd. 7 Upon this base a Upon the bones as the foundation, is built the flesh. Flesh is a similar part of the body, soft, ruddy, made of bloud indifferently dried, covered with the common membrane or skinne. curious work is rais'd, Like undivided brick, entire and one; Though soft, yet lasting, with just balance pais'd; Distributed with due proportion: And that the rougher frame might lurk unseen, All fair is hung with coverings slight and thinne; Which partly hide it all, yet all is partly seen: 8 As when a virgin her snow-circled breast Displaying hides, and hiding sweet displaies; The greater segments cover'd, and the rest The vail transparent willingly betraies; Thus takes and gives, thus lends and borrows light: Lest eyes should surfet with too greedy sight, Transparent lawns withhold, more to increase delight. 9 The whole body is as it were watered with great plenty of rivers, veins, arteries, and nerves.Nor is there any part in all this land, But is a little Isle: for thousand brooks In azure chanels glide on silver sand; Their serpent windings, and deceiving crooks Circling about, and wat'ring all the plain, Emptie themselves into th' all-drinking main; And creeping forward slide, but never turn again. 10 Three diff'ring streams from fountains different, Neither in nature nor in shape agreeing, (Yet each with other friendly ever went) Give to this Isle his fruitfulnesse and being: A vein is a vessell long, round, hollow, rising from the liver, appointed to contein, concoct, and distribute the bloud. It hath but one tunicle, and that thinne; the colour of this bloud is purple.The first in single chanels skie-like blue, With luke-warm waters di'd in porphyr hue, Sprinkle this crimson Isle with purple-colour'd dew. 11 An arterie is a vessel long, round, hollow, formed for conveyance of that more spritely bloud, which is elaborate in the heart. This bloud is frothy, yellowish, full of spirits, therefore compast with a double tunicle, that it might not exhale or sweat out by reason of the thinnesse.The next, though from the same springs first it rise, Yet passing through another greater fountain, Doth lose his former name and qualities: Through many a dale it flows, and many a mountain; More firie light, and needfull more then all; And therefore fenced with a double wall, All froths his yellow streams with many a sudding fall. 12 A nerve is a spermaticall part rising from the brain and the pith of the backbone, the outside skinne, the inside full of pith, carrying the animall spirits for sense and motion and therefore doubly skinned as the brain: none of them single, but runne in couples.The last, in all things diff'ring from the other, Fall from an hill, and close together go, Embracing as they runne, each with his brother; Guarded with double trenches sure they flow: The coldest spring, yet nature best they have; And like the lacteall stones which heaven pave, Slide down to every part with their thick milky wave. 13 The veins convey nourishment from the liver, the arteries life and heat from the heart, the nerves sense and motion from the brain. The will commands, the nerve brings, and the part executes the mandate; all almost in an instant.These with a thousand streams through th' Island roving, Bring tribute in; the first gives nourishment, Next life, last sense and arbitrarie moving: For when the Prince hath now his mandate sent, The nimble poasts quick down the river runne, And end their journey, though but now begunne; But now the mandate came, &amp; now the mandate's done. 14 The whole body may be parted into three regions: the lowest, or belly; the middle, or breast; the highest, or head. In the lowest the liver is sovereigne, whose regiment is the widest, but meanest. In the middle the heart reignes, most necessarie. The brain obtains the highest place, and is as the least in compasse, so the greatest in dignitie.The whole Isle, parted in three regiments, By three Metropolies is joyntly sway'd; Ord'ring in peace and warre their governments With loving concord, and with mutuall aid: The lowest hath the worst, but largest See; The middle lesse, of greater dignitie: The highest least, but holds the greatest soveraigntie. 15 Deep in a vale doth that first province lie, With many a citie grac't, and fairly town'd; And for a fence from forrain enmitie, The parts of the lower region are either the contained, or containing: the containing either common or proper: the common are the skinne, the fleshie pannicle, and the fat: the proper are the muscles of the belly-peece, or the inner rimme of the belly.With five strong-builded walls encompast round; Which my rude pencil will in limming stain; A work more curious, then which poets feigne Neptune and PhÅbus built, and pulled down again. 16 The skinne is a membrane of all the rest the most large, and thick, formed of the mixture of seed and bloud; the covering, and ornament of parts that are under it: the temper moderate, the proper organ of outward touching (say Physicians.)The first of these is that round spreading fence, Which like a sea girts th' Isle in every part; Of fairest building, quick and nimble sense, Of common matter fram'd with speciall art; Of middle temper, outwardest of all, To warn of every chance that may befall: The same a fence, and spie; a watchman, and a wall. 17 The native colour of the skinne is white but (as Hippo-crates) changed into the same colour which is brought by the humour predominant. Where melancholie abounds, it is swarthy; where flegme, it is white, and pale; where choler reignes, it is red and firy; but in sanguine of a rosie colour.His native beautie is a lilie white, Which still some other colour'd stream infecteth; Least like it self, with divers stainings dight, The inward disposition detecteth: If white, it argues wet; if purple, fire; If black, a heavie cheer, and fixt desire; Youthfull and blithe, if suited in a rosie tire. 18 The skinne is covered with the cuticle, or flourishing of the skinne, it is the mean of touching, without which we feel, but with pain. It polisheth the skinne, which many times is hanged, and (as it is with snakes) put off, and a new, and more amiable brought in.It cover'd stands with silken flourishing, Which as it oft decaies, renews again, The others sense and beautie perfecting; Which els would feel, but with unusuall pain: Whose pleasing sweetnesse, and resplendent shine, Softning the wanton touch, and wandring ey'n, Doth oft the Prince himself with witch'ries undermine. 19 The fat cometh from the airy portion of the bloud; which when it flows to the membranes, by their weak heat (which Physicians account, &amp; call cold) grows thick, and close.The second rampier of a softer matter, Cast up by th' purple rivers overflowing: Whose airy wave, and swelling waters, fatter For want of heat congeal'd, and thicker growing, The fat increaseth inward heat by keeping it from outward parts, and defends the parts subject to it from bruises.The wandring heat (which quiet ne're subsisteth) Sends back again to what confine it listeth; And outward enemies by yeelding most resisteth. 20 The fleshie pannicle is a membrane very thick, sinewy, woven in with little veins.The third more inward, firmer then the best, May seem at first but thinly built, and slight; But yet of more defence then all the rest; Of thick and stubborn substance, strongly dight. These three (three common fences) round impile This regiment, and all the other Isle; And saving inward friends, their outward foes beguile. 21 Beside these three, The proper parts infolding this lower region are two, the first the muscles of the belly-peece, which are eight, foure side-long, two right, and two crosse.two more appropriate guards With constant watch compasse this government: The first eight companies in severall wards, (To each his station in this regiment) On each side foure, continuall watch observe, And under one great Captain joyntly serve; Two fore-right stand, two crosse, and foure obliquely swerve. 22 PeritonÃ¦um (which we call the rimme of the belly) is a thinne membrane taking his name from compassing the bowels; round, but longer: every where double, yet so thinne, that it may seem but single. It hath many holes, that the veins, arteries, and other needfull vessels might have passage both in, &amp; out.The other fram'd of common matter, all This lower region girts with strong defence; More long then round, with double-builded wall, Though single often seems to slighter sense; With many gates, whose strangest properties Protect this coast from all conspiracies; Admitting welcome friends, excluding enemies. 23 The double tunicle of the rimme is plainly parted into a large space, that with a double wall it might fence the bladder, where the vessels of the navil are contained. These are foure: first, the nurse; which is a vein nourishing the infant in the wombe: 2, two arteries in which the infant breaths: the fourth, the Ourachos, a pipe whereby (while the childe is in the wombe) the urine is carried into the Allantoid, or rather Amnion; which is a membrane receiving the sweat and urine.Between this fences double-walled sides, Foure slender brooks run creeping o're the lea; The first is call'd the Nurse, and rising slides From this low regions Metropolie: Two from th' Heart-citie bend their silent pace; The last from Urine-lake with waters base In th' AllantoÃ¯d sea empties his flowing race. 24 The passages carrying the urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Some affirm that in the passage stands a curious lid, or cover.Down in a vale, where these two parted walls Differ from each with wide distending space, Into a lake the Urine-river falls, Which at the Nephros hill beginnes his race: Crooking his banks he often runs astray, Lest his ill streams might backward finde a way: Thereto, some say, was built a curious framed bay. 25 The bladder endeth in a neck of flesh, and is girded with a muscle which is called Sphincter: which holds in the urine lest it flow away without our permission. If this be loosened, or cold, the urine goes away from us of it self without any feeling.The Urine-lake drinking his colour'd brook, By little swells, and fills his stretching sides: But when the stream the brink 'gins over-look, A sturdy groom empties the swelling tides; Sphincter some call; who if he loosed be, Or stiffe with cold, out flows the senselesse sea, And rushing unawares covers the drowned lea. 26 Hence the urine is conveyed through the ordinary passages and cast out.From thence with blinder passage, (flying name) These noysome streams a secret pipe conveys; Which though we tearm the hidden parts of shame, Yet for the skill deserve no lesser praise Then they, to which we honour'd names impart. Oh powerfull Wisdome, with what wondrous art Mad'st thou the best, who thus hast fram'd the vilest part! 27 Beside the bladder there are six speciall parts contained in this lower region: the liver, stomack, with the guts; the gall, the splene, or milt; the kidneys, and parts for generation.Six goodly Cities, built with suburbs round, Do fair adorn this lower region: The stomack (or Koilia) is the first in order though not in dignitie.The first Koilia, whose extreamest bound On this side border'd by the Splenion, On that by soveraigne Hepars large commands: The merry Diazome above it stands, To both these joyn'd in league &amp; never failing bands. 28 Koilia, or the stomack is long &amp; round, like a bag-pipe, made to receive and concoct the meat, and to perfect the Chyle or white juice, which riseth from thee meat concocted.The form (as when with breath our bag-pipes rise, And swell) round-wise, and long, yet long-wise more; Fram'd to the most capacious figures guise: For 'tis the Islands garner; here its store Lies treasur'd up, which well prepar'd it sends By secret path that to th' Arch-citie bends; Which making it more fit, to all the Isle dispends. 29 Farre hence at foot of rocky Cephals hills This Cities Gustus, the taste, is the caterer, or steward to the stomack, which hath his place in Cephal, that is, the head. Steward dwells in vaulted stone; And twice a day Koilia's store-house fills With certain rent, and due provision: Aloft he fitly dwells in arched cave; Which to describe I better time shall have, When that fair mount I sing, &amp; his white curdy wave. 30 At that caves mouth In either chap are sixteen teeth; foure cutters, two dog-teeth, or breakers, ten grinders.twice sixteen Porters stand, Receivers of the customarie rent; Of each side foure, (the formost of the band) Whose office to divide what in is sent: Straight other foure break it in peices small; And at each hand twice five, which grinding all, Fit it for convoy, and this cities Arsenall. 31 From thence a The tongue with great agilitie delivers up the meat (well chewed) to the instruments of swallowing: eight muscles serving to this purpose which instantly send the meat through the Oesophagus or meat-pipe into the stomack.Groom with wondrous volubilitie Delivers all unto neare officers, Of nature like himself, and like agilitie; At each side foure, that are the governours To see the vict'als shipt at fittest tide; Which straight from thence with prosp'rous chanel slide, And in Koilia's port with nimble oars glide. 32 The The upper mouth of the stomack hath little veins, or strings circular, to shut in the meat, and keep it from returning. haven, fram'd with wondrous sense and art, Opens it self to all that entrance seek; Yet if ought back would turn, and thence depart, With thousand wrinkles shuts the ready creek: But when the rent is slack, it rages rife, And mutines in it self with civil strife: Thereto a Vas breve, or the short vessel, which sending in a melancholy humour, sharpens the appetite. little groom egges it with sharpest knife. 33 In the bottome of the stomack (which is placed in the midst of the belly) is concoction perfected.Below dwells in this Cities market-place The Islands common Cook, Concoction; Common to all; therefore in middle space Is quarter'd fit in just proportion; Whence never from his labour he retires; No rest he asks, or better change requires: Both night and day he works, ne're sleeps, nor sleep desires. 34 The concoction of meats in the stomack is perfected, as by an innate propertie, and speciall vertue, so also by the outward heat of parts adjoyning. For it is on every side compassed with hotter parts, which as fire to a caldron helps to seethe, and concoct; and the hot steams within it do not a little further digestionThat heat, which in his furnace ever fumeth, Is nothing like to our hot parching fire; Which all consuming, self at length consumeth; But moistning flames a gentle heat inspire, Which sure some in-born neighbour to him lendeth; And oft the bord'ring coast fit fuell sendeth, And oft the rising fume, which down again descendeth. 35 Like to a pot, where under hovering Divided flames, the iron sides entwining, Above is stopt with close-laid covering, Exhaling fumes to narrow straits confining; So doubling heat, his dutie doubly speedeth: Such is the fire Concoctions vessel needeth, Who daily all the Isle with fit provision feedeth. 36 There many a groom the busie Cook attends In under offices, and severall place: This gathers up the scumme, and thence it sends To be cast out; another liquours base, Another garbage, which the kitchin cloyes, And divers filth, whose sent the place annoyes, By divers secret waies in under-sinks convoyes. 37 The lower orifice, or mouth of the stomack, is not placed at the very bottome, but at the side, and is called the (Janitor or) Porter, as sending out the food now concocted through the entrails, which are knotty, and full of windings, lest the meat too suddenly passing through the body should make it too subject to appetite and greedinesse.Therefore a second Port is sidelong fram'd, To let out what unsavorie there remains: There sits a needfull groom, the Porter nam'd, Which soon the full-grown kitchin cleanly drains By divers pipes, with hundred turnings giring; Lest that the food too speedily retiring, Should whet the appetite, still cloy'd, &amp; still desiring. 38 So Erisicthon once fir'd (as men say) With hungry rage, fed never, ever feeding; Ten thousand dishes serv'd in every day, Yet in ten thousand, thousand dishes needing, In vain his daughter hundred shapes assum'd: A whole camps meat he in his gorge inhum'd; And all consum'd, his hunger yet was unconsum'd. 39 Such would the state of this whole Island be, If those pipes windings (passage quick delaying) Should not refrain too much edacitie, With longer stay fierce appetite allaying. It is approved that the entrails dried, and blown, are seven times longer then the body: they are all one entire body, yet their differing substance hath distinguished them into the thinne, &amp; thick: the thinne have the more noble office.These pipes are seven-fold longer then the Isle, Yet all are folded in a little pile, Whereof three noble are, and thinne; three thick, &amp; vile. 40 The first is straight without any winding, that the chyle might not return; and most narrow, that it might not finde too hasty a passage. It takes in a little passage from the gall, which there purges his choler, to provoke the entrails (when they are slow) to cast out the excrements. This is called Duodenum (or twelve finger) from his length.The first is narrow'st, and down-right doth look, Lest that his charge discharg'd might back retire; And by the way takes in a bitter brook, That when the chanel's stopt with stifeling mire, Through th' idle pipe with piercing waters soking, His tender sides with sharpest stream provoking, Thrusts out the muddy parts, &amp; rids the miry choking. 41 The second is called the lank or hungry gut, as being more emptie then the rest: for the liver being neare it sucks out his juice, or cream: it is known from the rest by the red colour.The second lean and lank, still pill'd, and harri'd By mighty bord'rers oft his barns invading: Away his food and new-inn'd store is carri'd; Therefore an angry colour, never fading, Purples his cheek: The third called Ilion (or winding) from his many folds and turnings, is of all the longest. the third for length exceeds, And down his stream in hundred turnings leads: These three most noble are, adorn'd with silken threads. 42 The first of the baser is called blinde: at whose end is an appendant, where if any of the thinner chyle do chance to escape, it is stopt, and by the veins of the midriffe suckt out.The formost of the base half blinde appeares; And where his broad way in an Isthmos ends, There he examines all his passengers, And those who ought not scape, he backward sends: The second is Colon (or the tormenter) because of the winde there staying, &amp; vexing the body.The second Ãols court, where tempests raging Shut close within a cave the windes encaging, With earthquakes shakes the Island, thunders sad presaging. 43 The last called Rectum, or straight, hath no windings, short, larger toward the end; that the excrement may more easily be ejected, and retained also upon occasion.The last down-right falls to port Esquiline, More strait above, beneath still broader growing; Soon as the gate opes by the Kings assigne, Empties it self, farre thence the filth out-throwing: This gate endow'd with many properties, Yet for his office sight and naming flies; Therefore between two hills, in darkest valley lies. 44 The thinne entrails serve for the carrying, &amp; through-concocting of the chyle: the thicker for the gathering, and containing the excrements.To that Arch-citie of this government The three first pipes the ready feast convoy: The other three, in baser office spent, Fling out the dregs, which else the kitchin cloy. They are all sprinkled with numberlesse little veins, that no part of the chyle might escape till all be brought to the liver.In every one the Hepar keeps his spies; Who if ought good with evil blended lies, Thence bring it back again to Hepars treasuries. 45 Two severall covers fence these twice three pipes: Epiploon (or Overswimmer, descends below the navill; and ascends above the highest entrails, of skinny substance all interlaced with fat.The first from over-swimming takes his name, Like cobweb-lawn woven with hundred stripes: The Mesenterium (or midst amongst the entrails, whence it takes the name) ties and knits the entrails together: it hath a double tunicle.The second, strength'ned with a double frame, From forein enmitie the pipes maintains: Pancreas (or All-flesh, for so it seems) is laid as a pillow under the stomack; and sustains the veins that are dispread from the gatevein.Close by the Pancreas stands, who ne're complains; Though prest by all his neighbours, he their state sustains. 46 Next Hepar, chief of all these lower parts, One of the three, yet of the three the least. But see, the Sunne, like to undaunted hearts, Enlarges in his fall his ample breast: Now hie we home; the pearled dew ere long Will wet the mothers, and their tender young: To morrow with the day we may renew our song. CANT. III. 1 The Morning fresh, dappling her horse with roses, (Vext at the lingring shades, that long had left her In Tithons freezing arms) the light discloses; And chasing Night, of rule and heav'n bereft her: The Sunne with gentle beams his rage disguises, And like aspiring tyrants, temporises; Never to be endur'd, but when he falls, or rises. 2 Thirsil from withy prison, as he uses, Lets out his flock, and on an hill stood heeding Which bites the grasse, and which his meat refuses; So his glad eyes fed with their greedy feeding: Straight flock a shoal of Nymphs &amp; shepherd-swains While all their lambes rang'd on the flowry plains; Then thus the boy began, crown'd with their circling trains. 3 You gentle shepherds, and you snowie fires, That sit around, my rugged rimes attending; How may I hope to quit your strong desires, In verse uncomb'd such wonders comprehending? Too well I know my rudenesse all unfit To frame this curious Isle, whose framing yet Was never throughly known to any humane wit. 4 Thou Shepherd-God, who onely know'st it right, And hid'st that art from all the world beside; Shed in my mistie breast thy sparkling light, And in this fogge my erring footsteps guide; Thou who first mad'st, and never wilt forsake it: Else how shall my weak hand dare undertake it, When thou thy self ask'st counsel of thy self to make it? 5 Next to Koilia, on the right side stands, Fairly dispread in large dominion, Th' Of all this lower region the Hepar, or liver, is the principall. The situation strong and safe, walled in by the ribs.Arch-citie Hepar, stretching her commands To all within this lower region; Fenc't with sure barres, and strongest situation; So never fearing foreiners invasion: Hence are the It is covered with one single tunicle; &amp; that very thinne, and slight.walls slight, thinne; built but for sight &amp; fashion. 6 The liver is tied to the heart by arteries, to the head by nerves, and to both by veins dispersed to both.To th' Heart and to th' Head-citie surely ti'd With firmest league, and mutuall reference: His liegers there, theirs ever here abide, To take up strife, and casuall difference: The liver consists of no ordinary flesh, but of a kinde proper to it self.Built all alike, seeming like rubies sheen, Of some peculiar matter; such I ween, As over all the world may no where else be seen. 7 The livers upper part rises &amp; swells gently; is very smooth, and even; the lower in the outside like to an hollow rock, rugged &amp; craggy.Much like a mount it easily ascendeth; The upper part's all smooth as slipperie glasse: But on the lower many a cragge dependeth; Like to the hangings of some rockie masse: From it rise all the springs of bloud, which runnes in the veins.Here first the purple fountain making vent, By thousand rivers through the Isle dispent, Gives every part fit growth and daily nourishment. 8 The steward of the whole Isle is here fitly placed, because as all (that is brought in) is here fitted, and disposed, so from hence returned, and dispensed.In this fair town the Isles great Steward dwells; His porphyre house glitters in purple die; In purple clad himself: from hence he deals His store to all the Isles necessitie: And though the rent he daily duly pay, Yet doth his flowing substance ne're decay; All day he rent receives, returns it all the day. 9 And like that golden starre, which cuts his way Through Saturns ice, and Mars his firy ball; Temp'ring their strife with his more kindely ray: So 'tween the Splenions frost and th' angry Gall The joviall Hepar sits; with great expence Cheering the Isle by his sweet influence; So slakes their envious rage and endlesse difference. 10 Within, some say, Here Plato disposed the seat of love. And certainly though lust (which some perversly call love) be otherwhere seated, yet that affection whereby we wish, and do well to others, may seem to be better fitted in the liver, then in the heart, (where most do place it) because this moderate heat appeares more apt for this affection; and fires of the heart where (as a Salamander) anger lives, seem not so fit to entertain it. Love hath his habitation; Not Cupids self, but Cupids better brother: For Cupids self dwells with a lower nation, But this more sure, much chaster then the other; By whose command we either love our kinde, Or with most perfect love affect the minde; With such a diamond knot he often souls can binde. 11 Hence rise the two great rivers of bloud, of which all the rest are lesser streams: The first is Porta, or the gate-vein, issuing from the hollow part and is shed toward the stomack, splene, guts, and the Epiploon. The second is Cava, the hollow vein, spreading his river over all the body.Two purple streams here raise their boiling heads; The first and least in th' hollow cavern breeding, His waves on divers neighbour grounds dispreads: The next fair river all the rest exceeding, Topping the hill, breaks forth in fierce evasion, And sheds abroad his Nile-like inundation; So gives to all the Isle their food and vegetation. 12 Yet these from other streams much different; For others, as they longer, broader grow; These as they runne in narrow banks impent, Are then at least, when in the main they flow: Much like a tree, which all his roots so guides, That all the trunk in his full body hides; Which straight his stemme to thousand branches subdivides. 13 The chyle, or juice of meats concocted in the stomack could not all be turned into sweet bloud by reason of the divers kindes of humours in it: Therefore there are three kinds of excrementall liquors suckt away by little vessels, and carried to their appointed places: one too light, and fiery; an other too earthy, and heavy; a third wheyish and watery.Yet lest these streams might hap to be infected With other liquours in the well abounding; Before their flowing chanels are detected, Some lesser delfs, the fountains bottome sounding, Suck out the baser streams, the springs annoying, An hundred pipes unto that end employing; Thence run to fitter place their noisome load convoying. 14 Such is fair Hepar; Famous the controversie between the Peripateticks, and Physicians: one holding the heart, the other the liver to be first. That the liver is first in time and making, is manifest; because the Nurse (the vein that feeds the infant yet in the wombe) empties it self upon the liver. which with great dissension Of all the rest pleads most antiquitie; But yet th' Heart-citie with no lesse contention, And justest challenge, claims prioritie: But sure the Hepar was the elder bore; For that small river, call'd the Nurse, of yore Laid boths foundation, yet Hepar built afore. 15 Three pois'nous liquours from this purple well Rise with the native streams; The first excrement drawn from the liver to the gall is cholerick, bitter, like flame in colour; which were it not removed, and kept in due place, would fill all the body with bitternesse, and gnawing. the first like fire, All flaming hot, red, furious, and fell, The spring of dire debate, and civile ire; Which wer't not surely held with strong retention, Would stirre domestick strife, and fierce contention, And waste the weary Isle with never ceas'd dissension. 16 Therefore close by a little conduit stands, Choledochus or the Gall, is of a membranous substance, having but one, yet that a strong tunicle. It hath two passages, one drawing the humour from the liver, another conveying the overplus into the first gut, and so emptying the gall. And this fence hath a double gate to keep the liquour from returning. Choledochus, that drags this poison hence, And safely locks it up in prison bands; Thence gently drains it through a narrow fence; A needfull fence, attended with a guard, That watches in the straits all closely barr'd, Lest some might back escape, and break the prison ward. 17 The The second ill humour is earthy, and heavy, which is drawn from the liver by little vessels unto the splene, the native seat of melancholie, here some have placed laughter: but the splene seems rather the seat of malice and heavinesse. next ill stream the wholesome fount offending, All dreery black and frightfull, hence convay'd By divers drains unto the Splenion tending, The Splenion o're against the Hepar laid, Built long, and square: some say that laughter here Keeps residence; but laughter fits not there, Where darknesse ever dwells, and melancholy fear. 18 If the splene should fail in this office, the whole body would be filled with melancholy fanices, and vain terrours. And should these waies, stopt by ill accident, To th' Hepar streams turn back their muddie humours; The cloudie Isle with hellish dreeriment Would soon be fill'd, and thousand fearfull rumours: Fear hides him here, lockt deep in earthy cell; Dark, dolefull, deadly-dull, a little hell; Where with him fright, despair, and thousand horrours dwell. 19 Where the splene flourishes, all the body decayes, and withers; where the splene is kept down, the body flourishes. Hence Stratonicus merrily said, that in Crete dead men walked, because they were so splenitive, and palecoloured.If this black town in over-growth increases, With too much strength his neighbours over-bearing; The Hepar daily, and whole Isle decreases, Like ghastly shade, or ashie ghost appearing: But when it pines, th' Isle thrives; its curse, his blessing: Trajan compared the splene to his exchequer: because as his coffers being full drained his subjects purses, so the full splene makes the body saplesse.So when a tyrant raves, his subjects pressing, His gaining is their losse, his treasure their distressing. 20 The watery humour with some good bloud (which is spent for the nourishment of those parts) is drawn by the kidneys.The third bad water, bubbling from this fountain, Is wheyish cold, which with good liquours meint, Is drawn into the double Nephros mountain; Which suck the best for growth, and nourishment: The Ureters receive the water separated from the bloud, as distilled from little fleshie substances in the kidneys, like to teats.The worst, as through a little pap, distilling To divers pipes, the pale cold humour swilling, Runs down to th' Urine-lake, his banks thrice daily filling. 21 The kidneys are both alike; the left somewhat higher: both have a double skinne, and both compassed with fat.These mountains differ but in situation; In form and matter like: the left is higher, Lest even height might slack their operation: Both like the Moon which now wants half her fire; Yet into two obtuser angles bended, Both strongly with a double wall defended; And both have walls of mudde before those walls extended. 22 The sixt and last town in this region, With largest stretcht precincts, and compasse wide, Is that, where Venus and her wanton sonne (Her wanton Cupid) will in youth reside: For though his arrows and his golden bow On other hills he frankly does bestow, Yet here he hides the fire with which each heart doth glow. 23 For that great Providence, their course foreseeing Too eas'ly led into the sea of death; After this first, gave them a second being, Which in their off-spring newly flourisheth: He therefore made the fire of generation To burn in Venus courts without cessation, Out of whose ashes comes another Island nation. 24 For from the first a fellow Isle he fram'd, (For what alone can live, or fruitfull be?) Arren the first, the second Thelu nam'd; Weaker the last, yet fairer much to see: Alike in all the rest, here disagreeing, Where Venus and her wanton have their being: For nothing is produc't of two in all agreeing. 25 But though some few in these hid parts would see Their Makers glory, and their justest shame; Yet for the most would turn to luxurie, And what they should lament, would make their game: Flie then those parts, which best are undescri'd; Forbear, my maiden song, to blazon wide What th' Isle and Natures self doth ever strive to hide. 26 These two fair Isles distinct in their creation, Yet one extracted from the others side, Are oft made one by Loves firm combination, And from this unitie are multipli'd: Strange may it seem; such their condition, That they are more dispread by union; And two are twenty made, by being made in one. 27 For from these two in Loves delight agreeing, Another little Isle is soon proceeding; At first of unlike frame and matter being, In Venus temple takes it form and breeding; Till at full time the tedious prison flying, It breaks all lets its ready way denying; And shakes the trembling Isle with often painfull dying. 28 So by the Bosphor straits in Euxine seas, Not farre from old Byzantum, closely stand Two neighbour Islands, call'd Symplegades, Which sometime seem but one combined land: For often meeting on the watrie plain, And parting oft, tost by the boist'rous main, They now are joyn'd in one, and now disjoyn'd again. 29 Here oft not Lust, but sweetest Chastitie, Coupled sometimes, and sometimes single, dwells; Now linkt with Love, to quench Lusts tyrannie, Now PhÅnix-like alone in narrow cells: Such PhÅnix one, but one at once may be: In Albions hills thee, Basilissa, thee, Such onely have I seen, such shall I never see. 30 What Nymph was this, (said fairest Rosaleen) Whom thou admirest thus above so many? She, while she was, (ah!) was the shepherds Queen; Sure such a shepherds Queen was never any: But (ah!) no joy her dying heart contented, Since she a deare Deers side unwilling rented; Whose death she all too late, too soon, too much, repented. 31 Ah royall maid! why should'st thou thus lament thee? Thy little fault was but too much beleeving: It is too much so much thou should'st repent thee; His joyous soul at rest desires no grieving. These words (vain words!) fond comforters did lend her; But (ah!) no words, no prayers might ever bend her To give an end to grief, till endlesse grief did end her. 32 But how should I those sorrows dare display? Or how limme forth her vertues wonderment? She was (ay me! she was) the sweetest May That ever flowr'd in Albions regiment. Few eyes fall'n lights adore: yet fame shall keep Her name awake, when others silent sleep; While men have eares to heare, eyes to look back, and weep. 33 And though the curres (which whelpt &amp; nurst in Spain, Learn of fell Geryon to snarle and brawl) Have vow'd and strove her Virgin tombe to stain; And grinne, and fome, and rage, and yelp, and bawl: Yet shall our Cynthia's high-triumphing light Deride their houling throats, and toothlesse spight; And sail through heav'n, while they sink down in endlesse night. 34 So is this Islands lower region: Yet ah much better is it sure then so. But my poore reeds, like my condition, (Low is the shepherds state, my song as low) Marre what they make: but now in yonder shade Rest we, while Sunnes have longer shadows made: See how our panting flocks runne to the cooler glade. CANT. IIII. 1 The shepherds in the shade their hunger feasted With simple cates, such as the countrey yeelds; And while from scorching beams secure they rested, The Nymphs disperst along the woody fields, Pull'd from their stalks the blushing strawberries, Which lurk close shrouded from high-looking eyes; Shewing that sweetnesse oft both low and hidden lies. 2 But when the day had his meridian runne Between his highest throne, and low declining; Thirsil again his forced task begunne, His wonted audience his sides entwining. The middle Province next this lower stands, Where th' Isles Heart-city spreads his large c?mands, Leagu'd to the neighbour towns with sure and friendly bands. 3 Such as that starre, which sets his glorious chair In midst of heav'n, and to dead darknesse here Gives light and life; such is this citie fair: Their ends, place, office, state, so nearely neare, That those wise ancients from their natures sight, And likenesse, turn'd their names, and call'd aright The sunne the great worlds heart, the heart the lesse worlds light. 4 The heart is the seat of heat and life; therefore walled about with the ribs, for more safety.This middle coast to all the Isle dispends All heat and life: hence it another Guard (Beside those common to the first) defends; Built whole of massie stone, cold, drie, and hard: Which stretching round about his circling arms, Warrants these parts from all exteriour harms; Repelling angry force, securing all alar'ms. 5 But in the front The breasts, or paps, are given to men for strength, and ornament; to women, for milk and nurserie also. two fair twin-bulwarks rise, In th' Arren built for strength, and ornament; In Thelu of more use, and larger size; For hence the young Isle draws his nourishment: Here lurking Cupid hides his bended bow; Here milkie springs in sugred rivers flow; Which first gave th' infant Isle to be, and then to grow. 6 When the infant grows big, he so oppresseth the vessels of bloud, that partly through the readinesse of the passage, but especially by the providence of God, the bloud turns back to the breast, &amp; there by an innate but wonderfull facultie is turned into milk.For when the lesser Island (still increasing In Venus temple) to some greatnesse swells, Now larger rooms and bigger spaces seizing, It stops the Hepar rivers; backward reels The stream, and to these hills bears up his flight, And in these founts (by some strange hidden might) Dies his fair rosie waves into a lily white. 7 So where fair Medway, down the Kentish dales To many towns her plenteous waters dealing, Lading her banks, into wide Thamis falls; The big-grown main with fomie billows swelling, Stops there the sudding stream; her steddy race Staggers awhile, at length flies back apace, And to the parent fount returns its fearfull pace. 8 The breasts are in figure hemisphericall; whose tops are crowned with the teats, about which are reddish circles, called (AreolÃ¦, or) little altars.These two fair mounts are like two hemispheres, Endow'd with goodly gifts and qualities; Whose top two little purple hillocks reares, Most like the Poles in heavens Axletrees: And round about two circling altars gire, In blushing red; the rest in snowy tire Like Thracian HÃ¦mus looks, which ne're feels PhÅbus fire. 9 That mighty hand in these dissected wreathes, (Where moves our Sunne) his thrones fair picture gives; The pattern breathlesse, but the picture breathes; His highest heav'n is dead, our low heav'n lives: Nor scorns that loftie one thus low to dwell; Here his best starres he sets, and glorious cell; And fills with saintly spirits, so turns to heav'n from hell. 10 About this Region round in compasse stands A Guard, both for defence, and respiration, In the Thorax or breast, are sixty five muscles for respiration, or breathing, which is either free, or forced: The instruments of forced breathing are sixtie foure, whereof thirtie two distend, and as many contract it.Of sixtie foure, parted in severall bands; Half to let out the smokie exhalation, The other half to draw in fresher windes: Beside both these, a third of both their kindes, That lets both out, &amp; in; which no enforcement bindes. 11 This third the merrie The instrument of the free breathing is the Diazome or Diaphragma, which we call the midriffe, as a wall parting the heart and liver: Plato affirms it a partition between the seats of desire, and anger: Aristotle, a barre to keep the noisome odour of the stomack from the heart. Diazome we call, A border-citie these two coasts removing; Which like a balk, with his crosse-builded wall, Disparts the terms of anger, and of loving; Keeps from th' Heart-citie fuming kitchin fires, And to his neighbours gentle windes inspires; The midriffe dilates it self when it draws in, contracts it self when it puffes out the aire.Loose when he sucks in aire, contract when he expires. 12 The midriffe consists of two circles, one skinny, the other fleshie. It hath two tunicles, as many veins and arteries, and foure nerves.The Diazome of severall matter's fram'd: The first moist, soft; harder the next, and drier: His fashion like the fish a Raia nam'd; Fenc'd with two walls, one low, the other higher; By eight streams water'd; two from Hepar low, And from th' Heart-town as many higher go; But two twice told down from the Cephal mountain flow. 13 Here most men have placed the seat of laughter: It hath much sympathie with the brain; so that if the midriffe be inflamed, present madnes ensues it.Here sportfull Laughter dwells, here ever sitting, Defies all lumpish griefs, and wrinkled care; And twentie merrie-mates mirth causes fitting, And smiles, which Laughters sonnes, yet infants are. But if this town be fir'd with burnings nigh, With selfsame flames high Cephals towers fry; Such is their feeling love, and loving sympathie. 14 This coast stands girt with a Within, the Pleura (or skinne which clotheth the ribs on the inside) compasses this middle region.peculiar wall, The whole precinct, and every part defending: The chiefest part of this middle region is the Heart, placed in the midst of this province, and of the whole bodie: fitly was it placed in the midst of all, as being of all the most needfull.The chiefest Citie, and Imperiall, Is fair Kerdia, farre his bounds extending; Which full to know were knowledge infinite: How then should my rude pen this wonder write, Which thou, who onely mad'st it, onely know'st aright? 15 In middle of this middle Regiment Kerdia seated lies, the centre deem'd Of this whole Isle, and of this government: If not the chiefest this, yet needfull'st seem'd, Therfore obtain'd an equall distant seat, More fitly hence to shed his life and heat, And with his yellow streams the fruitfull Island wet. 16 The Heart is immured partly by a membrane going round about it, (and thence receiving his name) and a peculiar tunicle; partly with an humour like whey or urine, as well to cool the heart, as to lighten the body.Flankt with two severall walls (for more defence) Betwixt them ever flows a wheyish moat; In whose soft waves, and circling profluence This Citie, like an Isle, might safely float: In motion still (a motion fixt, not roving) Most like to heav'n in his most constant moving: Hence most here plant the seat of sure and active loving. 17 Built of a substance like smooth porphyrie; The flesh of the heart is proper and peculiar to it self, not like other muscles; of a figure pyramicall. The point of the heart is (as with a diademe) girt with two arteries, and a vein, called the crowns.His matter hid, and (like it self) unknown: Two rivers of his own; another by, That from the Hepar rises, like a crown, Infold the narrow part: for that great All This his works glory made pyramicall; Then crown'd with triple wreath, &amp; cloath'd in scarlet pall. 18 The Cities self in two Though the heart be an entire body, yet it is severed into two partitions, the right, and left; of which the left is more excellent and noble.partitions rest; That on the right, this on the other side: The right receives into his hollownesse the bloud flowing from the liver, and concocts it.The right (made tributarie to the left) Brings in his pension at his certain tide, A pension of liquours strangely wrought; Which first by Hepars streams are hither brought, And here distill'd with art, beyond or words or thought. 19 This right side sends down to the lungs that part of this bloud which is lesse laboured, and thicker; but the thinner part it sweats through a fleshie partition into the left side.The grosser waves of these life-streams (which here With much, yet much lesse labour is prepar'd) A doubtfull chanel doth to Pneumon bear: But to the left those labour'd extracts shar'd, This fleshie partition severs the right side from the left; at first it seems thick, but if it be well viewed, we shall see it full of many pores, or passages.As through a wall, with hidden passage slide; Where many secret gates (gates hardly spi'd) With safe convoy give passage to the other side. 20 At each hand of the left Two skinny additions (from their likenesse called the ears) receive, the one the thicker bloud, (that called the right) the other (called the left) takes in the aire sent by the lungs.two streets stand by, Of severall stuffe, and severall working fram'd, With hundred crooks, and deep-wrought cavitie: Both like the eares in form, and so are nam'd. I'th' right hand street the tribute liquour sitteth: The left forc't aire into his concave getteth; Which subtile wrought, &amp; thinne, for future workmen fitteth. 21 The Cities The left side of the heart takes in this aire, and bloud; and concocting them both in his hollow bosome, sends them out by the great arterie into the whole body.left side, (by some hid direction) Of this thinne aire, and of that right sides rent, (Compound together) makes a strange confection; And in one vessel both together meynt, Stills them with equall never-quenched firing: Then in small streams (through all the Island wiring) Sends it to every part, both heat and life inspiring. 22 In the heart are foure great vessels: the first is the hollow vein bringing in the bloud from the liver; at whose mouth stand three little folding doores, with three forks giving passage, but no return to the bloud.In this Heart-citie foure main streams appeare; One from the Hepar, where the tribute landeth, Largely poures out his purple river here; At whose wide mouth a band of Tritons standeth, (Three Tritons stand) who with their three-forkt mace Drive on, and speed the rivers flowing race, But strongly stop the wave, if once it back repace. 23 The second vessel is called the arterie-vein, which rising from the right side of the heart, carries down the bloud here prepared to the lungs for their nourishment. Here also is the like three-folding doore, made like half-circles; giving passage from the heart, but not backward.The second is that doubtfull chanel, lending Some of this tribute to the Pneumon nigh; Whose springs by carefull guards are watcht, that sending From thence the waters, all regresse denie: The third is called the Veiny arterie, rising from the left side, which hath two folds three-forked.The third unlike to this, from Pneumon flowing, And his due ayer-tribute here bestowing, Is kept by gates and barres, which stop all backward going. 24 The fourth is the great arterie. This hath also a floudgate made of three semicircular membranes, to give out load to the vitall spirits, and stop their regresse.The last full spring out of this left side rises, Where three fair Nymphs, like Cynthia's self appearing, Draw down the stream which all the Isle suffices; But stop back-waies, some ill revolture fearing. This river still it self to lesse dividing, At length with thousand little brooks runnes sliding, His fellow course along with Hepar chanels guiding. 25 The Heart is the fountain of life and heat to the whole bodie, and the seat of passions. Within this Citie is the palace fram'd, Where life, and lifes companion, heat, abideth; And their attendants, passions untam'd: (Oft very hell in this strait room resideth) And did not neighbouring hills, cold aires inspiring, Allay their rage and mutinous conspiring, Heat all (it self and all) would burn with quenchlesse firing. 26 Yea that great Light, by whom all heaven shines With borrow'd beams, oft leaves his loftie skies, And to this lowly seat himself confines. Fall then again, proud heart, now fall to rise: Cease earth, ah cease, proud Babel earth, to swell: Heav'n blasts high towers, stoops to a low-rooft cell; First heav'n must dwell in man, then man in heav'n shall dwell. 27 Close to Kerdia The Pneumon (or lungs) is nearest the heart, whose flesh is light, and spongie, very large. It is the instrument of breathing, and speaking, divided into many parcels, yet all united into one bodie. Pneumon takes his seat, Built of a lighter frame, and spungie mold: Hence rise fresh aires to fanne Kerdia's heat; Temp'ring those burning fumes with moderate cold: It self of largest size, distended wide, In divers streets and out-wayes multipli'd: Yet in one Corporation all are joyntly ti'd. 28 Fitly 't is cloath'd with hangings The Lungs are covered with a light &amp; very thinne tunicle, lest it might be an hinderance to the motion.thinne and light, Lest too much weight might hinder motion: His chiefest use to frame the voice aright; (The voice which publishes each hidden notion) And for that end The windepipe, which is framed partly of cartilage, or grisly matter, because the voice is perfected with hard &amp; smooth things; (these cartilages are compassed like a ring) partly of skin, which tie the grisles together.a long pipe down descends, (Which here it self in many lesser spends) Untill low at the foot of Cephal mount it ends. 29 This pipe was built for th' aiers safe purveiance, To fit each severall voice with perfect sound; Therefore of divers matter the conveiance Is finely fram'd; the first in circles round, In hundred circles bended, hard and drie, (For watrie softnesse is sounds enemie) Not altogether close, yet meeting very nigh. 30 The seconds drith and hardnesse somewhat lesse, But smooth and pliable made for extending, Fills up the distant circles emptinesse; All in one bodie joyntly comprehending: And because the rings of the grisles do not wholly meet, this space is made up by muscles, that so the meat-pipe adjoyning might not be galled, or hurt.The last most soft, which where the circles scanted Not fully met, supplies what they have wanted, Not hurting tender parts, which next to this are planted. 31 The Larynx, or covering of the winde-pipe, is a grisly substance, parted into foure grisles of which the first is ever unmoved, and in women often double. Upon the top there stands the pipes safe covering, Made for the voices better modulation: Above it foureteen carefull warders hovering, Which shut and open it at all occasion: The cover in foure parts it self dividing, Of substance hard, fit for the voices guiding; One still unmov'd (in Thelu double oft) residing. 32 Adjoyning to it is the Oesophagus, or meat-pipe: conveying meats and drinks to the stomack. Close by this pipe runnes that great chanel down, Which from high Cephals mount twice every day Brings to Koilia due provision: At whose end is the Epiglottis, or cover of the throat, the principall instrument of tuning, and apting the voice; &amp; therefore grisly, that it might sooner fall when we swallow, and rise when we breathe. Straight at whose mouth a floud-gate stops the way, Made like an Ivie leaf, broad-angle-fashion; Of matter hard, fitting his operation, For swallowing soon to fall, and rise for inspiration. 33 But see, the smoak mounting in village nigh, With folded wreaths steals through the quiet aire; And mixt with duskie shades in Eastern skie, Begins the night, and warns us home repair: Bright Vesper now hath chang'd his name and place, And twinkles in the heav'n with doubtfull face: Home then my full-fed lambes; the night comes, home apace. CANT. V. 1 By this the old nights head (grown hoary gray) Foretold that her approaching end was neare; And gladsome birth of young succeeding day Lent a new glory to our Hemispheare: The early swains salute the infant ray; Then drove the dammes to feed, the lambes to play: And Thirsil with nights death revives his morning lay. 2 The highest region in this little Isle Is both the Islands and Creatours glorie: Ah then, my creeping Muse, and rugged style, How dare you pencill out this wondrous storie? Oh thou that mad'st this goodly regiment, So heav'nly fair, of basest element, Make this inglorious verse thy glories instrument. 3 So shall my flagging Muse to heav'n aspire, Where with thy self thy fellow-shepherd sits; And warm her pineons at that heav'nly fire; But (ah!) such height no earthly shepherd fits: Content we here low in this humble vale On slender reeds to sing a slender tale. A little boat will need as little sail and gale. 4 The head of these three regions is the least, but nobles in frame, and office: most like to heaven as well in site, being highest in this little world, as also in figure, being round.The third precinct, the best and chief of all, Though least in compasse, and of narrow space, Was therefore fram'd like heaven, sphericall, Of largest figure, and of loveliest grace: Though shap'd at first the least of all the three; Yet highest set in place, as in degree, And over all the rest bore rule and soveraigntie. 5 So of three parts fair Europe is the least, In which this earthly Ball was first divided; Yet stronger farre, and nobler then the rest, Where victorie and learned arts resided, And by the Greek and Romane monarchie Swaid both the rest; now prest by slaverie Of Mosco, and the big-swoln Turkish tyrannie. 6 The Brain is the seat of the minde, and senses.Here all the senses dwell, and all the arts; Here learned Muses by their silver spring: The The head is divided into the Citie, and Suburbs; the brain within the wall of the skull, and the face without.Citie sever'd in two divers parts, Within the walls, and Suburbs neighbouring; The Suburbs girt but with the common fence, Founded with wondrous skill, and great expence; And therefore beautie here keeps her chief residence. 7 And sure for ornament and buildings rare, Lovely aspect, and ravishing delight, Not all the Isle or world with this compare; But in the Thelu is the fairer sight: These Suburbs many call the Islands face; Whose charming beautie, and bewitching grace Ofttimes the Prince himself enthralls in fetters base. 8 For as this Isle is a short summarie Of all that in this All is wide dispread; So th' Islands face is th' Isles Epitomie, Where ev'n the Princes thoughts are often read: For when that All had finisht every kinde, And all his works would in lesse volume binde, Fair on the face he wrote the Index of the minde. 9 Fair are the Suburbs; yet to clearer sight The Cities self more fair and excellent: A thick-grown wood, not pierc'd with any light, Yeelds it some fence, and much more ornament: The divers-colour'd trees and fresh aray Much grace the town, but most the Thelu gay: Yet all in winter turn to snow, and soon decay. 10 Like to some stately work, whose queint devices, And glitt'ring turrets with brave cunning dight, The gazers eye still more and more entices Of th' inner rooms to get a fuller sight; Whose beautie much more winnes his ravisht heart, That now he onely thinks the outward part To be a worthie cov'ring of so fair an art. 11 Beside the common tunicles of the whole body, the brain is covered first with the bone of the skull, secondly with the Pericranium, or skin covering the skull, &amp; thirdly with two inward skinnes.Foure severall walls, beside the common guard, For more defence the citie round embrace: The first thick, soft; the second drie and hard; As when soft earth before hard stone we place. The second all the Citie round enlaces, And like a rock with thicker sides embraces; For here the Prince his court &amp; standing palace places. 12 These two are called the hard, and tender mother.The other two of matter thinne and light; And yet the first much harder then the other; Both cherish all the Citie: therefore right They call that th' hard, and this the tender mother. The whole substance of the brain is divided into foure parts by divers folds of the inward skinne.The first with divers crooks and turnings wries, Cutting the town in foure quaternities; But both joyn to resist invading enemies. 13 Next these, the buildings yeeld themselves to sight; The The outside of the brain is softer, and of ashie colour; the inward part white, and harder, framed of seed.outward soft, and pale, like ashes look; The inward parts more hard, and curdy white: Their matter both from th' Isles first matter took; Nor cold, nor hot: heats needfull sleeps infest, Cold nummes the workmen; middle temper's best; When kindely warmth speeds work, &amp; cool gives timely rest. 14 Almost in the midst of the brain are two hollow places, like half moons, of much use for preparing the spirits, emptying rheugme, receiving odours, &amp;c.Within the centre (as a market place) Two caverns stand, made like the Moon half spent; Of speciall use, for in their hollow space All odours to their Judge themselves present: Here first are born the spirits animall, Whose matter, almost immateriall, Resembles heavens matter quintessentiall. 15 Here is a knot of veins and arteries weaved together; by which the animall spirits are concocted, thinned and fitted for service: and close by are two little bunches like teats, the instruments of smelling.Hard by, an hundred nimble workmen stand, These noble spirits readily preparing; Lab'ring to make them thinne, and fit to hand, With never ended work, and sleeplesse caring: Hereby two little hillocks joyntly rise, Where sit two Judges clad in seemly guise, That cite all odours here, as to their just assise. 16 Next is that Septum lucidum, or bright wall, severing these hollow caverns.Next these, a wall built all of saphires shining, As fair, more precious; hence it takes his name; The third cavitie is nothing else but a meeting of the two former.By which the third cave lies, his sides combining To th' other two, and from them hath his frame; (A meeting of those former cavities) It lies under (corpus Cameratum or) the chamber-substance, which with three arches bears up the whole weight of the brain.Vaulted by three fair arches safe it lies, And no oppression fears, or falling tyrannies. 17 By the third cavitie are two passages; and at the end of the first is the (Infundibulum or) tunnell, under which is (Glans Pituitaria or) the Rheugmkernell, as a spunge sucking the rheugms, &amp; distilling them into the palate.By this third cave the humid citie drains Base noisome streams the milkie streets annoying; And through a wide-mouth'd tunnel duely strains, Unto a bibbing substance down convoying; Which these foul dropping humours largely swills, Till all his swelling spunge he greedy fills, And then through other sinks by little soft distills. 18 The other passage reaches to the fourth cavitie, which yeelds a safe way for the spirits.Between this and the fourth cave, lies a vale, (The fourth, the first in worth, in rank the last) Where two round hills shut in this pleasant dale, Through which the spirits thither safe are past; The fourth cavitie is most noble, where all the spirits are perfected. By it is the pith, or marrow, the fountain of these spirits.Those here refin'd their full perfection have; And therefore close by this fourth wondrous cave Rises that silver well, scatt'ring his milkie wave. 19 Not that bright spring, where fair Hermaphrodite Grew into one with wanton Salmacis, Nor that where Biblis dropt, too fondly light, Her tears and self, may dare compare with this; This pith, or marrow, springing in the brain flows down through the back bone.Which here beginning down a lake descends, Whose rockie chanel these fair streams defends, Till it the precious wave through all the Isle dispends. 20 All the nerves imparting all sense and motion to the whole body have their root partly from the brain, and partly from the back bone.Many fair rivers take their heads from either, (Both from the lake, and from the milkie well) Which still in loving chanels runne together, Each to his mate a neighbour parallel: Thus widely spread with friendly combination, They fling about their wondrous operation, And give to every part both motion and sensation. 21 The pith of the back bone springeth from the brain, whence by foure passages it is conveyed into the back; and there all foure joyn in one, and again are thence divided into divers others.This silver lake, first from th' Head-citie springing, To that bright fount foure little chanels sends; Through which it thither plenteous water bringing, Straight all again to every place dispends: Such is th' Head-citie, such the Princes Hall; Such, and much more, which strangely liberall, Though sense it never had, yet gives all sense to all. 22 Of other stuffe the Suburbs have their framing; May seem soft marble, spotted red and white: The first part of the face is the forehead, at whose base are the eyes.First stands an Arch, pale Cynthia's brightnes shaming, The Cities forefront, cast in silver bright: At whose proud base are built two watching towers, Whence hate and love skirmish with equall powers; Whence smiling gladnesse shines, and sullen sorrow showers. 23 The eyes are the index of the minde, discovering every affection.Here sits retir'd the silent reverence; And when the Prince, incens'd with angers fire, Thunders aloud, he darts his lightning hence; Here dusky-reddish clouds foretell his ire: Of nothing can this Isle more boast aright: A twin-born Sunne, a double seeing light; With much delight they see, are seen with much delight. 24 That Orpheus called the eyes the looking glasse of nature. Thracian shepherd call'd them Natures glasse; Yet then a glasse in this much worthier being: Blinde glasses represent some neare-set face; But this a living glasse, both seen and seeing: Plato affirmed them lighted up with heavenly fire not burning, but shining.Like heav'n in moving, like in heav'nly firing; Sweet heat and light, no burning flame inspiring: Yet (ah!) too oft we find they scorch with hot desiring. 25 They mounted high, sit on a loftie hill; (For they the Princes best intelligence, And quickly warn of future good, or ill) Here stands the palace of the noblest sense; Here Visus keeps, whose Court then crystall smoother, And clearer seems; he, though a younger brother, Yet farre more Visus, or the Sight, is the most noble above all the senses.noble is, farre fairer then the other. 26 There are six muscles moving the eye, thus termed by Anatomists.Six bands are set to stirre the moving tower: The first the proud band call'd, that lifts it highter; The next the humble band, that shoves it lower; The bibbing third draws it together nigher; The fourth disdainfull, oft away is moving: The other two, helping the compasse roving, Are call'd the circling trains, &amp; wanton bands of loving. 27 Above are the eyebrowskeeping off the sweat that it fall not into the eyes.Above, two compasse groves, (Loves bended bows) Which fence the towers from flouds of higher place: The eyelids shutting the eye are two; the lower ever unmoved in man: and hairs keeping off dust, flies, &amp;c.Before, a wall, deluding rushing foes, That shuts and opens in a moments space: The low part fixt, the higher quick descending; Upon whose tops spearmen their pikes intending, Watch there both night and day, the castles port defending. 28 There are three humours in the eye: the first the Watrie, breaking the too vehement light, and stopping the spirits from going out too fast.Three divers lakes within these bulwarks lie, The noblest parts and instruments of sight: The first, receiving forms of bodies nigh, Conveys them to the next, and breaks the light, Danting his rash and forcible invasion; And with a clear and whitish inundation, Restrains the nimble spirits from their too quick evasion. 29 The second is the Crystalline, and most noble, seated and compast between the other two, and being altered by the entring shapes, is the chief instrument of sight.In midst of both is plac't the Crystall pond; Whose living water thick, and brightly shining, Like Saphires, or the sparkling Diamond, His inward beams with outward light combining, Alt'ring it self to every shapes aspect, The divers forms doth further still direct, Till by the nimble poast th' are brought to th' Intellect. 30 The third from the likenesse is called the glassie humour.The third, like molten glasse, all cleare and white: Both round embrace the noble Crystalline. There are six tunicles belonging to the eye: The first called the conjunctive, solid, thick, compassing the whole eye, but onely the black window.Six inward walls fence in this Tower of sight: The first, most thick, doth all the frame inshrine, And girts the Castle with a close embrace, Save in the midst is left a circles space, Where light and hundred shapes flock out &amp; in apace. 31 The second is Cornea or, hornie tunicle, transparent, and made of the hard mother.The second not so massie as the other, Yet thicker then the rest, and tougher fram'd, Takes his beginning from that harder mother: The outward part like horn, and thence is nam'd; Through whose translucent sides much light is born Into the Tower, and much kept out by th' horn, Makes it a pleasant light, much like the ruddie morn. 32 The third is (Uvea or) grapie; made of the tender mother, thinne, and pervious by a little and round window: it is diversly coloured without, but exceeding black within.The third, of softer mold, is like a grape, Which all entwines with his encircling side: In midst a window lets in every shape; Which with a thought is narrow made, or wide: His inmost side more black then starrelesse night; But outward part (how like an hypocrite!) As painted Iris looks, with various colours dight. 33 The fourth is more thinne then any cobweb (and thence so called) immediately compassing the Crystalline humour.The fourth of finest work, more slight, and thinne, Then or Arachne, (which in silken twine With Pallas strove) or Pallas self could spinne: This round enwraps the fountain Crystalline. The fift, Reticularis, netty tunicle, framed of the substance of the brain: this diffuseth the visil spirits, and perceives the alteration of the Crystalline; and here is the mean of sight.The next is made out of that milkie spring, That from the Cephal mount his waves doth fling, Like to a curious net his substance scattering. 34 His substance as the Head-spring, perfect white; Here thousand nimble spies are round dispread: The forms caught in this net, are brought to sight, And to his eye are lively pourtrayed. The sixt is called the glassie tunicle, clasping in the glassie humour.The last the glassie wall (that round encasing The moat of glasse, is nam'd from that enlacing) The white &amp; glassy wells parts with his strict embracing. 35 Thus then is fram'd the noble Visus bower; The outward light by th' first walls circle sending His beams and hundred forms into the tower, The wall of horn, and that black gate transcending, Is lightned by the brightest Crystalline, And fully view'd in that white nettie shine, From thence with speedy haste is poasted to the minde. 36 Much as an one-ey'd room, hung all with night, (Onely that side, which adverse to his eye Gives but one narrow passage to the light, Is spread with some white shining tapestrie) An hundred shapes that through flit ayers stray, Shove boldly in, crouding that narrow way, And on that bright-fac'd wall obscurely dancing play. 37 The eye hath two nerves, the Optick or seeing nerve, and moving. The optick, separate in their root, in the midst of their progresse meet, and strengthen one the other.Two pair of rivers from the Head-spring flow To these two Towers: the first in their mid-race (The spies conveying) twisted joyntly go, Strength'ning each other with a firm embrace. The moving, rising from the same stemme, are at length severed; therefore as one moves, so moves the other.The other pair these walking Towers are moving; At first but one, then in two chanels roving: And therefore both agree in standing, or removing. 38 Hearing is the second sense, lesse noble then the eye, more needfull. Auditus, second of the Pemptarchie, Is next, not all so noble as his brother; Yet of more need, and more commoditie: His seat is plac'd somewhat below the other: Of each side of the mount a double cave; Both which a goodly Portall doth embrave, And winding entrance, like MÃ¦anders erring wave. 39 The outward eare is of a grisly matter, covered with the common tunicle. It is framed with many crooks, lest the aire should enter too forcibly.The Portall hard and drie, all hung around With silken, thinne, carnatian tapestrie: Whose open gate drags in each voice and sound, That through the shaken ayer passes by: The entrance winding; lest some violence Might fright the Judge with sudden influence, Or some unwelcome guest might vex the busie sense. 40 The inward eare consists of foure passages: the first is steepie, lest any thing should creep in.This caves first part fram'd with a steep ascent (For in foure parts 'tis fitly severed) Makes th' entrance hard, but easie the descent: Where stands a braced drumme, whose sounding head (Obliquely plac'd) strook by the circling aire, Gives instant warning of each sounds repair, Which soon is thence convey'd unto the Judgement chair. 41 If the Drum be wet with falling of rheugm, we are hard of hearing; but if it grow thick, we are irrecoverably deaf.The drumme is made of substance hard and thinne; Which if some falling moisture chance to wet, The loudest sound is hardly heard within: But if it once grows thick, with stubborn let It barres all passage to the inner room; No sounding voice unto his seat may come: The lazie sense still sleeps, unsummon'd with his drum. 42 The Drumme parteth the first and second passage. To it are joyned three little bones, the instruments of hearing, which never grow, or decrease in childehood or age: they are all in the second passage.This drumme divides the first and second part, In which three hearing instruments reside; Three instruments compact by wondrous art, With slender string knit to th' drummes inner side: Their native temper being hard and drie, Fitting the sound with their firm qualitie, Continue still the same in age and infancie. 43 The first of these bones is called the Hammer, the second the Stithe, the third the Stirrup; all taking their names from their likenesse: all tied to the Drumme by a little string.The first an Hammer call'd, whose out-grown sides Lie on the drumme; but with his swelling end Fixt in the hollow Stithe, there fast abides: The Stithes short foot doth on the drumme depend, His longer in the Stirrup surely plac't; The Stirrups sharp side by the Stithe embrac't, But his broad base ti'd to a little window fast. 44 These are two small passages, admitting the sounds into the head, and cleansing the aire.Two little windows ever open lie, The sound unto the caves third part convaying; And slender pipe, whose narrow cavitie Doth purge the in-born aire, that idle staying Would els corrupt, and still supplies the spending: The caves third part in twentie by-wayes bending, Is call'd the Labyrinth, in hundred crooks ascending. 45 Such whilome was that eye-deceiving frame, Which crafty DÃ¦dal with a cunning hand Built to empound the Cretan Princes shame: Such was that Woodstock cave, where Rosamand, Fair Rosamand, fled jealous Ellenore; Whom late a shepherd taught to weep so sore, That woods and hardest rocks her harder fate deplore. 46 The third part with his narrow rockie straits Perfects the sound, and gives more sharp accenting; Then sends it to the The last passage is called the Cochlea, snail, or Periwincle; where the nerves of hearing plainlyappeare.fourth; where ready waits A nimble poast, who ne're his haste relenting, Flings to the judgement-seat with speedy flight: There th' equall Judge attending day and night, Receives the entring sounds, &amp; dooms each voice aright. 47 As when a stone, troubling the quiet waters, Prints in the angry stream a wrinkle round, Which soon another and another scatters, Till all the lake with circles now is crown'd: All so the aire struck with some violence nigh, Begets a world of circles in the skie; All which infected move with sounding qualitie. 48 These at Auditus palace soon arriving, Enter the gate, and strike the warning drumme; To those three instruments fit motion giving, Which every voice discern: then that third room Sharpens each sound, and quick conveys it thence; Till by the flying poast 'tis hurri'd hence, And in an instant brought unto the judging sense. 49 This sense is made the Master of request, Prefers petitions to the Princes eare; Admits what best he likes, shuts out the rest; And sometimes cannot, sometimes will not heare: Ofttimes he lets in anger-stirring lies, Oft melts the Prince with oylie flatteries. Ill mought he thrive, that loves his Masters enemies! 50 'Twixt Visus double court a Tower stands, Plac't in the Suburbs centre; whose high top, And loftie raised ridge the rest commands: Low at his foot a double doore stands ope, Admitting passage to the aires ascending; And divers odours to the Citie sending, Revives the heavie town, his liberall sweets dispending. 51 This vaulted Tower's half built of massie stone, The other half of stuffe lesse hard and drie, Fit for distending, or compression: The outward wall may seem all porphyrie. The sense of smelling. Olfactus dwells within this lofty fort; But in the citie is his chief resort, Where 'twixt two little hils he keeps his judging court. 52 By two great caves are plac't these These are those two little bunches like paps, or teats, spoken of the 15 Stanz. of this Cant.little hills, Most like the nipples of a virgins breast; By which the aire that th' hollow Tower fills, Into the Citie passeth: with the rest The odours pressing in are here all staid; Till by the sense impartially weigh'd, Unto the common Judge they are with speed conveyd. 53 At each side of that Tower stand two fair plains, More fair then that which in rich Thessalie Was once frequented by the Muses trains: Here ever sits sweet-blushing Modestie; Here in two colours Beautie shining bright, Dressing her white with red, her red with white, With pleasing chain enthralls, &amp; bindes loose wandring sight. 54 Below, a cave rooft with an Gustus, or the taste is in the palate, which in the Greek is called the heaven.heav'n-like plaister, And under strew'd with purple tapestrie, Where Gustus dwells, the Isles and Princes Taster, Koilia's Steward, one of th' Pemptarchie; Taste is a kinde of touch, nor can it exist but by touching.Whom Tactus (so some say) got of his mother: For by their nearest likenesse one to th' other, Tactus may eas'ly seem his father, and his brother. 55 Tactus, or the sense of touching. Tactus the last, but yet the eldest brother; (Whose office meanest, yet of all the race The first and last, more needfull then the other) Hath his abode in none, yet every place: Through all the Isle distended is his dwelling; He rules the streams that from the Cephal swelling Runne all along the Isle, both sence &amp; motion dealing. 56 With Gustus Lingua dwells, his pratling wife, Indu'd with strange and adverse qualities; The nurse of hate and love, of peace and strife, Mother of fairest truth, and foulest lies: Or best, or worst; no mean: made all of fire, Which sometimes hell, &amp; sometimes heav'ns inspire; By whom oft Truth self speaks, oft that first murth'ring liar. 57 The idle Sunne stood still at her command, Breathing his firie steeds in Gibeon: And pale-fac'd Cynthia at her word made stand, Resting her coach in vales of Aialon. Her voice oft open breaks the stubborn skies, And holds th' Almighties hands with suppliant cries: Her voice tears open hell with horrid blasphemies. 58 Therefore that great Creatour, well foreseeing To what a monster she would soon be changing, (Though lovely once, perfect and glorious being) Curb'd her with iron The Tongue is held with a ligament, ordinarily called the bridle.bit, and held from ranging; And with strong bonds her looser steps enchaining, Bridled her course, too many words refraining, And doubled all his guards, bold libertie restraining. 59 The Tongue is guarded with thirtie two teeth, and with the lips; all which do not a little help the speech, and sweeten the voice.For close within he sets twice sixteen guarders, Whose hardned temper could not soon be mov'd: Without the gate he plac'd two other warders, To shut and ope the doore, as it behov'd: But such strange force hath her enchanting art, That she hath made her keepers of her part, And they to all her slights all furtherance impart. 60 Thus (with their help) by her the sacred Muses Refresh the Prince dull'd with much businesse; By her the Prince unto his Prince oft uses In heav'[n]ly throne from hell to finde accesse. She heav'n to earth in musick often brings, And earth to heaven: but oh how sweet she sings, When in rich graces key she tunes poor natures strings! 61 Thus Orpheus wanne his lost Eurydice; Whom some deaf snake, that could no musick heare, Or some blinde neut, that could no beautie see, Thinking to kisse, kill'd with his forked spear: He, when his plaints on earth were vainly spent, Down to Avernus river boldly went, And charm'd the meager ghosts with mournfull blandishment. 62 There what his mother, fair Calliope, From PhÅbus harp and Muses spring had brought him, What sharpest grief for his Eurydice, And love redoubling grief had newly taught him, He lavisht out, and with his potent spell Bent all the rigorous powers of stubborn hell: He first brought pitie down with rigid ghosts to dwell. 63 Th' amazed shades came flocking round about, Nor car'd they now to passe the Stygian ford: All hell came running there, (an hideous rout) And dropt a silent tear for every word: The aged Ferrieman shov'd out his boat; But that without his help did thither float; And having ta'ne him in, came dancing on the moat. 64 The hungry Tantal might have fill'd him now, And with large draughts swill'd in the standing pool: The fruit hung listning on the wondring bough, Forgetting hells command; but he (ah fool!) Forgot his starved taste, his eares to fill. Ixions turning wheel unmov'd stood still; But he was rapt as much with powerfull musicks skill. 65 Tir'd Sisyphus sat on his resting stone, And hop'd at length his labour done for ever: The vulture feeding on his pleasing mone, Glutted with musick, scorn'd grown Tityus liver: The Furies flung their snakie whips away, And molt in tears at his enchanting lay, No shrieches now were heard; all hell kept holy-day. 66 That treble Dog, whose voice ne're quiet fears All that in endlesse nights sad kingdome dwell, Stood pricking up his thrice two listning eares, With greedy joy drinking the sacred spell; And softly whining, piti'd much his wrongs; And now first silent at those dainty songs, Oft wisht himself more ears, &amp; fewer mouths &amp; tongues. 67 At length return'd with his Eurydice, But with this law, not to return his eyes, Till he was past the laws of Tartarie; (Alas! who gives love laws in miseries? Love is loves law; love but to love is ti'd) Now when the dawns of neighbour day he spi'd, Ah wretch! Eurydice he saw, and lost, and di'd. 68 All so who strives from grave of hellish night To bring his dead soul to the joyfull skie; If when he comes in view of heav'nly light, He turns again to hell his yeelding eye, And longs to see what he had left; his sore Grows desp'rate, deeper, deadlier then afore: His helps and hopes much lesse, his crime &amp; judgement more. 69 But why do I enlarge my tedious song, And tire my flagging Muse with wearie flight? Ah! much I fear I hold you much too long. The outward parts be plain to every sight: But to describe the people of this Isle, And that great Prince, these reeds are all too vile: Some higher verse may fit, and some more loftie style. 70 See, Phlegon drenched in the hizzing main, Allayes his thirst, and cools the flaming carre; Vesper fair Cynthia ushers, and her train: See, th' apish earth hath lighted many a starre, Sparkling in dewie globes: all home invite: Home then my flocks, home shepherds, home; 'tis night: My song with day is done; my Muse is set with light. 71 By this the gentle boyes had framed well A myrtle garland mixt with conqu'ring bay, From whose fit match issu'd a pleasing smell, And all enamel'd it with roses gay; With which they crown their honour'd Thirsils head: Ah blessed shepherd-swain! ah happy meed! While all his fellows chaunt on slender pipes of reed. CANT. VI. The houres had now unlockt the gate of day, When fair Aurora leaves her frosty bed, Hasting with youthfull Cephalus to play, Unmaskt her face, and rosie beauties spread: Tithonus silver age was much despis'd. Ah! who in love that cruel law devis'd, That old love's little worth, and new too highly priz'd? 2 The gentle shepherds on an hillock plac'd, (Whose shadie head a beechie garland crown'd) View'd all their flocks that on the pastures graz'd: Then down they sit, while Thenot 'gins the round; Thenot! was never fairer boy among The gentle lads, that in the Muses throng By Chamus yellow streams learn tune their pipe &amp; song. 3 See, Thirsil, see the shepherds expectation; Why then, (ah!) why sitt'st thou so silent there? We long to know that Islands happy nation: Oh! do not leave thy Isle unpeopled here. Tell us who brought, and whence these colonies; Who is their King, what foes, and what allies; What laws maintain their peace, what warres &amp; victories. 4 Thenot, my deare, that simple fisher-swain, Whose little boat in some small river strayes; Yet fondly lanches in the swelling main, Soon, yet too late, repents his foolish playes. How dare I then forsake my well-set bounds, Whose new-cut pipe as yet but harshly sounds? A narrow compasse best my ungrown Muse impounds. 5 Two shepherds most I love with just adoring; That Mantuan swain, who chang'd his slender reed To trumpets martiall voice, and warres loud roaring, From Corydon to Turnus derring-deed; And next our home-bred Colins sweetest firing; Their steps not following close, but farre admiring: To lackey one of these is all my prides aspiring. 6 Then you my peers, whose quiet expectation Seemeth my backward tale would fain invite; Deigne gently heare this purple Islands nation, A people never seen, yet still in sight; Our daily guests, and natives, yet unknown; Our servants born, but now commanders grown; Our friends, and enemies; aliens, yet still our own. 7 Not like those Heroes, who in better times This happy Island first inhabited In joy and peace; when no rebellious crimes That God-like nation yet dispeop'led: Those claim'd their birth from that eternal Light, Held th' Isle, and rul'd it in their fathers right, And in their faces bore their parents image bright. 8 For when the Isle that main would fond forsake, In which at first it found a happy place, And deep was plung'd in that dead hellish lake; Back to their father flew this heav'nly race, And left the Isle forlorn, and desolate; That now with fear, and wishes all too late, Sought in that blackest wave to hide his blacker fate. 9 How shall a worm, on dust that crawls and feeds, Climbe to th' empyreall court, where these states reign, And there take view of what heav'ns self exceeds? The Sunne lesse starres, these lights the Sunne distain: Their beams divine, and beauties do excell What here on earth, in aire, or heav'n do dwell: Such never eye yet saw, such never tongue can tell. 10 Soon as these Saints the treach'rous Isle forsook, Rusht in a false, foul, fiend-like companie, And every fort, and every castle took; All to this rabble yeeld the soveraigntie: The goodly temples which those Heroes plac't, By this foul rout were utterly defac't, And all their fences strong, and all their bulwarks raz'd. 11 So where the neatest Badger most abides, Deep in the earth she frames her prettie cell, And into halls and closulets divides: But when the stinking fox with loathsome smell Infects her pleasant cave, the cleanly beast So hates her inmate and rank-smelling guest, That farre away she flies, and leaves her loathed nest. 12 But when those Graces (at their fathers throne Arriv'd) in heav'ns high Court to Justice plain'd, How they were wrong'd, and forced from their own, And what foul people in their dwellings reign'd; How th' earth much waxt in ill, much wan'd in good, So full-ripe vice, how blasted vertues bud, Begging such vicious weeds might sink in vengefull floud: 13 Forth stept the just DicÃ¦a, full of rage; (The first-born daughter of th' Almighty King) Ah sacred maid, thy kindled ire asswage; Who dare abide thy dreadfull thundering? Soon as her voice but Father onely spake, The faultlesse heav'ns, like leaves in Autumne, shake; And all that glorious throng with horrid palsies quake. 14 Heard you not See that sweet poem entituled Christs victorie and triumph. part. 1. stan. 18.late, with what loud trumpet sound Her breath awak'd her fathers sleeping ire? The heav'nly armies flam'd, earth shook, heav'n frown'd, And heav'ns dread King call'd for his three-forkt fire. Heark how the powerfull words strike through the eare; The frighted sense shoots up the staring hair, And shakes the trembling soul with fright &amp; shudd'ring fear. 15 So have I seen the earth strong windes detaining In prison close; they scorning to be under Her dull subjection, and her power disdaining, With horrid struglings tear their bonds in sunder: Mean while the wounded earth, that forc'd their stay, With terrour reels, the hils runne farre away; And frighted world fears hell breaks out upon the day. 16 But see how 'twixt her sister and her sire, Soft-hearted Mercy sweetly interposing, Settles her panting breast against his fire, Pleading for grace, and chains of death unloosing: Heark, from her lips the melting hony flowes; The striking Thunderer recals his blowes, And every armed souldier down his weapon throwes. 17 So when the day, wrapt in a cloudie night, Puts out the Sunne, anon the rattling hail On earth poures down his shot with fell despight: His powder spent, the Sunne puts off his vail, And fair his flaming beauties now unsteeps; The plough-man from his bushes gladly peeps, And hidden traveller out of his covert creeps. 18 Ah fairest maid, best essence of thy father, Equall unto thy never equall'd sire; How in low verse shall thy poore shepherd gather, What all the world can ne're enough admire? When thy sweet eyes sparkle in chearfull light, The brightest day grows pale as leaden night, And heav'ns bright burning eye loses his blinded sight. 19 Who then those sugred strains can understand, Which calm'd thy father, and our desp'rate fears; And charm'd the nimble lighthing in his hand, That all unwares it dropt in melting tears? Then thou deare A book entituled Christs victorie and triumph.swain, thy heav'nly load unfraught; For she her self hath thee her speeches taught; So neare her heav'n they be, so farre from humane thought. 20 But let my lighter skiffe return again Unto that little Isle which late it left, Nor dare to enter in that boundlesse main, Or tell the nation from this Island reft; But sing that civil strife, and home dissension 'Twixt two strong factions with like fierce contention; Where never peace is heard, nor ever peaces mention. 21 For that foul rout, which from the Stygian brook (Where first they dwelt in midst of death and night) By force the left and emptie Island took, Claim hence full conquest, and possessions right: But that fair band, which Mercie sent anew, The ashes of that first heroick crue, From their forefathers claim their right, &amp; Islands due. 22 In their fair look their parents grace appeares, Yet their renowned sires were much more glorious; For what decaies not with decaying yeares? All night, and all the day, with toil laborious, (In losse and conquest angrie) fresh they fight: Nor can the other cease or day or night, While th' Isle is doubly rent with endlesse warre and fright. 23 As when the Britain and Iberian fleet With resolute and fearlesse expectation On trembling seas with equall fury meet, The shore resounds with diverse acclamation; Till now at length Spains firie Dons 'gin shrink: Down with their ships, hope, life, and courage sink: Courage, life, hope, and ships the gaping surges drink. 24 But who (alas!) shall teach my ruder breast The names and deeds of these heroick Kings? Or downy Muse, which now but left the nest, Mount from her bush to heav'n with new-born wings? Thou sacred maid, which from fair Palestine Through all the world hast spread thy brightest shine Kindle thy shepherd-swain with thy light flaming eyn. 25 Sacred Thespio, which in Sinaies grove First took'st thy being and immortall breath, And vaunt'st thy off-spring from the highest Fove, Yet deign'dst to dwell with mortalls here beneath, With vilest earth, and men more vile residing; Come holy Virgin in my bosome sliding, With thy glad Angel light my blindfold footsteps guiding. 26 And thou dread Spirit, which at first didst spread On those dark waters thy all-opening light; Thou who of late (of thy great bounty head) This nest of hellish fogges and Stygian night With thy bright orient Sunne hast fair renew'd, And with unwonted day hast it endu'd, Which late both day &amp; thee, and most it self eschew'd: 27 Dread Spirit, do thou those severall bands unfold, Both which thou sent'st a needfull supplement To this lost Isle, and which with courage bold Hourely assail thy rightfull regiment; And with strong hand oppresse &amp; keep them under: Raise now my humble vein to lofty thunder, That heav'n and earth may sound, resound thy praises wonder. 28 The Islands Prince, of frame more then celestiall, Is rightly call'd th' all-seeing Intellect; All glorious bright, such nothing is terrestriall; Whose Sun-like face, and most divine aspect No humane sight may ever hope descrie: For when himself on's self reflects his eye, Dull and amaz'd he stands at so bright majestie. 29 Look as the Sunne, whose ray and searching light Here, there, and every where it self displayes, No nook or corner flies his piercing sight; Yet on himself when he reflects his rayes, Soon back he flings the too bold vent'ring gleam; Down to the earth the flames all broken stream: Such is this famous Prince, such his unpierced beam. 30 His strangest body is not bodily, But matter without matter; never fill'd, Nor filling; though within his compasse high All heav'n and earth, and all in both are held; Yet thousand thousand heav'ns he could contain, And still as empty as at first remain; And when he takes in most, readi'st to take again. 31 Though travelling all places, changing none: Bid him soar up to heav'n, and thence down throwing The centre search, and Dis dark realm; he's gone, Returns, arrives, before thou saw'st him going: And while his weary kingdome safely sleeps, All restlesse night he watch and warding keeps, Never his carefull head on resting pillow steeps. 32 In every quarter of this blessed Isle Himself both present is, and President; Nor once retires, (ah happy realm the while, That by no Officers lewd lavishment, With greedie lust, and wrong consumed art!) He all in all, and all in every part, Does share to each his due, and equall dole impart. 33 He knows nor death, nor yeares, nor feeble age; But as his time, his strength and vigour grows: And when his kingdome by intestine rage Lies broke and wasted, open to his foes, And batter'd sconce now flat and even lies; Sooner then thought to that great Judge he flies, Who weighs him just reward of good, or injuries. 34 For he the Judges Viceroy here is plac't; Where if he live, as knowing he may die, He never dies, but with fresh pleasures grac't, Bathes his crown'd head in soft eternitie; Where thousand joyes, and pleasures ever new, And blessings thicker then the morning dew, With endlesse sweets rain down on that immortall crue. 35 There golden starres set in the crystall snow; There daintie joyes laugh at white-headed caring: There day no night, delight no end shall know; Sweets without surfet, fulnesse without sparing, And by its spending growing happinesse: There God himself in glories lavishnesse Diffus'd in all, to all, is all full blessednesse. 36 But if he here neglect his Masters law, And with those traitours 'gainst his Lord rebells; Down to the deeps ten thousand fiends him draw, Deeps, where night, death, despair and horrour dwells; And in worst ills, still worse expecting fears: Where fell despite for spite his bowels tears, And still increasing grief, and torment never wears. 37 Prayers there are idle, death is woo'd in vain; In midst of death poore wretches long to die: Night without day or rest, still doubling pain; Woes spending still, yet still their end lesse nigh: The soul there restlesse, helplesse, hopelesse lies; The body frying roars, and roaring fries: There's life that never lives, there's death that never dies. 38 Hence while unsetled here he fighting reignes, Shut in a Tower where thousand enemies Assault the fort, with wary care and pains He guards all entrance, and by divers spies Searches into his foes and friends designes: For most he fears his subjects wavering mindes. This Tower then onely falls, when treason undermines. 39 Therefore while yet he lurks in earthly tent, Disguis'd in worthlesse robes and poore attire, Trie we to view his glories wonderment, And get a sight of what we so admire: For when away from this sad place he flies, And in the skies abides, more bright then skies, Too glorious is his sight for our dimme mortall eyes. 40 So curl'd-head Thetis, waters feared Queen, But bound in cauls of sand, yeelds not to sight; And planets glorious King may best be seen, When some thinne cloud dimmes his too piercing light, And neither none, nor all his face discloses: For when his bright eye full our eye opposes, None gains his glorious sight, but his own sight he loses. 41 Within the Castle sit eight Counsellers, That help him in this tent to govern well: Each in his room a severall office bears; Three of his inmost private counsell deal In great affairs: five of lesse dignitie Have outward Courts, and in all actions prie, But still referre the doom to Courts more fit and high. 42 Those The five sensesfive fair brethren which I sung of late, For their just number call'd the Pemptarchie; The other three, three pillars of the state: The The common sense.first in midst of that high Tower doth lie, (The chiefest mansion of this glorious King) The Judge and Arbiter of every thing, Which those five brethrens poasts in to his office bring. 43 Of middle yeares, and seemly personage, Father of laws, the rule of wrong and right; Fountain of judgement, therefore wondrous sage, Discreet, and wise, of quick and nimble sight: Not those seven Sages might him parallell, Nor he whom Pythian Maid did whilome tell To be the wisest man that then on earth did dwell. 44 As Neptunes cestern sucks in tribute tides (Yet never full) which every chanel brings, And thirstie drinks, and drinking thirstie bides; For by some hidden way back to the springs It sends the streams in erring conduits spread, Which with a circling dutie still are led; So ever feeding them, is by them ever fed: 45 Ev'n so the first of these three Counsellers Gives to the five the power of all-descrying; Which back to him with mutuall dutie bears All their informings, and the causes trying: For through strait waies the nimble Poast ascends Unto his hall; there up his message sends, Which to the next well scann'd he straightway recommends. 46 The The fancie.next that in the Castles front is plac't, Phantastes hight; his yeares are fresh and green, His visage old, his face too much defac't With ashes pale, his eyes deep sunken been With often thoughts, and never slackt intention: Yet he the fount of speedy apprehension, Father of wit, the well of arts, and quick invention. 47 But in his private thoughts and busy brain Thousand thinne forms, and idle fancies flit; The three-shap't Sphinx, and direfull Harpyes train, Which in the world had never being yet: Oft dreams of fire and water, loose delight; And oft arrested by some ghastly sprite, Nor can he think, nor speak, nor move for great affright. 48 Phantastes from the first all shapes deriving, In new abiliments can quickly dight; Of all materiall and grosse parts depriving, Fits them unto the noble Princes sight; Which soon as he hath view'd with searching eye, He straight commits them to his Treasurie, Which old Eumnestes keeps, Father of memorie. 49 Eumnestes old, who in his living screen (His mindefull breast) the rolls and records bears Of all the deeds, and men, which he hath seen, And keeps lockt up in faithfull Registers: Well he recalls Nimrods first tyrannie, And Babels pride daring the lofty skie; Well he recalls the earths twice-growing infancie. 50 Therefore his body weak, his eyes halfblinde, But minde more fresh, and strong; (ah better fate!) And as his carcase, so his house declin'd; Yet were the walls of firm and able state: Onely on him a nimble Page attends, Who when for ought the aged Grandsire sends, With swift, yet backward steps, his helping aidance lends. 51 But let my song passe from these worthy Sages Unto this Islands highest The understanding.Soveraigne, And those hard warres which all the yeare he wages: For these three late a gentle shepherd-swain Most sweetly sung, as he before had seen In Alma's house: his memorie yet green Lives in his well-tun'd songs, whose leaves immortall been. 52 Nor can I guesse, whether his Muse divine Or gives to those, or takes from them his grace; Therefore Eumnestes in his lasting shrine Hath justly him enroll'd in second place: Next to our Mantuan poet doth he rest; There shall our Colin live for ever blest, Spite of those thousand spites, which living him opprest. 53 The Prince his time in double office spends: For first those forms and fancies he admits, Which to his Court busie Phantastes sends, And for the easier discerning fits: For shedding round about his sparkling light, He cleares their duskie shades, and cloudy night, Producing like himself their shapes all shining bright. 54 As when the Sunne restores the glitt'ring day, The world late cloath'd in nights black livery, Doth now a thousand colours fair display, And paints it self in choice varietie, Which late one colour hid, the eye deceiving; All so this Prince those shapes obscure receiving, With his suffused light makes ready to conceiving. 55 This first is call'd the Active Facultie, Which to an higher power the object leaves: That takes it in it self, and cunningly Changing it self, the object soon perceives: For straight it self in self same shape adorning, Becomes the same with quick &amp; strange transforming; So is all things it self, to all it self conforming. 56 Thus when the eye through Visus jettie ports Lets in the wandring shapes, the crystall strange Quickly it self to every sort consorts, So is what e're it sees by wondrous change: Thrice happy then, when on that 2. Cor. 3. 18.mirrour bright He ever fastens his unmoved sight, So is what there he views; divine, full, glorious light. 57 Soon as the Prince these forms hath clearely seen, Parting the false from true, the wrong from right, He straight presents them to his beauteous Queen, Whose Courts are lower, yet of equall might; The will. Voletta fair, who with him lives, and reignes; Whom neither man, nor fiend, nor God constrains: Oft good, oft ill, oft both; yet ever free remains. 58 Not that great Soveraigne of the Fayrie land, Whom late our Colin hath eternized, (Though Graces decking her with plenteous hand, Themselves of grace have all unfurnished; Though in her breast she Vertues temple bare, The fairest temple of a guest so fair) Not that great Glorians self with this might e're compare. 59 Her radiant beautie, daz'ling mortall eye, Strikes blinde the daring sense; her sparkling face Her husbands self now cannot well descrie: With such strange brightnesse, such immortall grace, Hath that great parent in her cradle made, That Cynthia's silver cheek would quickly fade, And light it self to her would seem a painted shade. 60 But (ah!) entic't by her own worth and pride, She stain'd her beautie with most loathsome spot; Her Lords fixt law, and spouses light deni'd, So fill'd her spouse and self with leprous blot: And now all dark is their first morning ray. What verse might then their former light display, When yet their darkest night outshines the brightest day? 61 On her a royall damsell still attends, And faithfull Counseller, Conscience. Synteresis: For though Voletta ever good intends, Yet by fair ills she oft deceived is; By ills so fairly drest with cunning slight, That Vertues self they well may seem to sight, But that bright Vertues self oft seems not half so bright. 62 Therefore Synteresis of nimble sight, Oft helps her doubtfull hand, and erring eye; Els mought she ever stumbling in this night Fall down as deep as deepest Tartarie: Nay thence a sad-fair maid, Repentance, rears, And in her arms her fainting Lady bears, Washing her often stains with ever-falling tears. 63 Thereto she addes a water soveraigne, Of wondrous force, and skilfull composition: For first she pricks the heart in tender vein, Then from those precious drops, and deep contrition, With lips confession, and with pickled cries, Still'd in a broken spirit, sad vapours rise, Exhal'd by sacred fires, and drop through melting eyes. 64 These cordiall drops, these spirit-healing balms Cure all her sinfull bruises, cleare her eyes, Unlock her ears, recover fainting qualms: And now grown fresh and strong, she makes her rise, And glasse of unmaskt sinne she bright displaies, Whereby she sees, loathes, mends her former waies; So soon repairs her light, trebling her new-born raies. 65 But (ah!) why do we (simple as we been) With curious labour, dimme and vailed sight, Prie in the nature of this King and Queen, Groping in darknesse for so cleare a light? A light which once could not be thought or told, But now with blackest clouds is thick enroll'd, Prest down in captive chains, and pent in earthly mold. 66 Rather lament we this their wretched fate, (Ah wretched fate, and fatal wretchednesse!) Unlike those former dayes, and first estate, When he espous'd with melting happinesse To fair Voletta, both their lights conspiring, He saw what e're was fit for her requiring, And she to his cleare sight would temper her desiring. 67 When both replenisht with celestiall light, All coming evils could foresee and flie; When both with clearest eye, and perfect sight Could every natures difference descrie: Whose pictures now they scarcely see with pain, Obscure and dark, like to those shadows vain, Which thinne and emptie glide along Avernus plain. 68 The flowres that frighted with sharp winters dread, Retire into their mother Tellus wombe, Yet in the Spring in troups new mustered Peep out again from their unfrozen tombe: The early Violet will fresh arise, And spreading his flour'd purple to the skies, Boldly the little elf the winters spite defies. 69 The hedge green Sattin pinkt and cut arayes, The Heliotrope to cloth of gold aspires; In hundred-colour'd silks the Tulip playes, Th' Imperiall flower his neck with pearl attires, The Lily high her silver Grogram reares, The Pansie her wrought Velvet garment bears; The red Rose Scarlet, and the Provence Damask wears. 70 How falls it then that such an heav'nly light, As this great Kings, should sink so wondrous low, That scarce he can suspect his former height? Can one eclipse so dark his shining brow, And steal away his beautie glittering fair? One onely blot so great a light empair, That never could he hope his waning to repair? 71 Ah! never could he hope once to repair So great a wane, should not that new-born Sun Adopt him both his brother and his heir; Who through base life, and death, and hell would run, To seat him in his lost, now surer cell. That he may mount to heav'n, he sunk to hell; That he might live, he di'd; that he might rise, he fell. 72 A perfect Virgin breeds and bears a Sonne, Th' immortall father of his mortall mother; Earth, heav'n, flesh, spirit, man, God, are met in one: His younger brothers childe, his childrens brother, Eternitie, who yet was born and di'd; His own creatour, earths scorn, heavens pride; Who th' deitie inflesht, and mans flesh deifi'd. 73 Thou uncreated Sunne, heav'ns glory bright, Whom we with knees and hearts low bent adore; At rising, perfect, and now falling, light; Ah what reward, what thanks shall we restore? Thou wretched wast, that we might happy be: Oh all the good we hope, and all we see, That we thee know and love, comes from thy love, and thee. 74 Receive, which we can onely back return, (Yet that we may return, thou first must give) A heart, which fain would smoke, which fain would burn In praise; for thee, to thee would onely live: And thou (who sat'st in night to give us day) Light and enflame us with thy glorious ray, That we may back reflect, and borrow'd light repay. 75 So we beholding with immortall eye The glorious picture of thy heav'nly face, In his first beautie and true Majestie, May shake from our dull souls these fetters base; And mounting up to that bright crystal sphere, Whence thou strik'st all the world with shudd'ring fear, May not be held by earth, nor hold vile earth so deare. 76 Then should thy shepherd (poorest shepherd) sing A thousand Canto's in thy heav'nly praise, And rouze his flagging Muse, and flutt'ring wing, To chant thy wonders in immortall laies, (Which once thou wrought'st, when Nilus slimie shore, Or Fordans banks thy mighty hand adore) Thy judgements, &amp; thy mercies; but thy mercies more. 77 But see, the stealing night with softly pace, To flie the Western Sunne, creeps up the East; Cold Hesper 'gins unmask his evening face, And calls the winking starres from drouzie rest: Home then my lambes; the falling drops eschew: To morrow shall ye feast in pastures new, And with the rising Sunne banquet on pearled dew. CANT. VII. 1 The rising morn lifts up his orient head, And spangled heav'ns in golden robes invests; Thirsil up starting from his fearlesse bed, Where uselesse nights he safe and quiet rests, Unhous'd his bleating flock, and quickly thence Hasting to his expecting audience, Thus with sad verse began their grieved mindes incense: 2 Fond man, that looks on earth for happinesse, And here long seeks what here is never found! For all our good we hold from heav'n by lease, With many forfeits and conditions bound; Nor can we pay the fine and rentage due: Though now but writ, and seal'd, and giv'n anew, Yet daily we it break, then daily must renew. 3 Why should'st thou here look for perpetuall good, At every losse against heav'ns face repining? Do but behold where glorious Cities stood, With gilded tops, and silver turrets shining; There now the Hart fearlesse of greyhound feeds, And loving Pelican in safety breeds; There shrieching Satyres fill the peoples emptie steads. 4 Where is th' Assyrian Lions golden hide, That all the East once graspt in lordly paw? Where that great Persian Beare, whose swelling pride The Lions self tore out with ravenous jaw? Or he which 'twixt a Lion, and a Pard, Through all the world with nimble pineons far'd, And to his greedy whelps his conquer'd kingdomes shar'd? 5 Hardly the place of such antiquitie, Or note of these great monarchies we finde: Onely a fading verball memorie, And empty name in writ is left behinde: But when this second life, and glory fades, And sinks at length in times obscurer shades, A second fall succeeds, and double death invades. 6 That monstrous beast, which nurst in Tibers fenne, Did all the world with hideous shape affray; That fill'd with costly spoil his gaping denne, And trode down all the rest to dust and clay: His batt'ring horns pull'd out by civil hands, And iron teeth lie scatter'd on the sands; Backt, bridled by a Monk, with sev'n heads yoked stands. 7 And that black The Turk.Vulture, which with deathfull wing O're-shadows half the earth, whose dismall sight Frighted the Muses from their native spring, Already stoops, and flagges with weary flight. Who then shall look for happines beneath; Where each new day proclaims chance, change, and death, And life it self's as flit as is the aire we breathe? 8 Ne mought this Prince escape, though he as farre All these excells in worth and heav'nly grace, As brightest PhÅbus does the dimmest starre: The deepest falls are from the highest place. There lies he now bruis'd with so sore a fall, To his base bonds, and loathsome prison thrall, Whom thousand foes besiege, fenc'd with frail yeelding wall. 9 Tell me, oh tell me then, thou holy Muse, Sacred Thespio, what the cause may be Of such despite, so many foemen use To persecute unpiti'd miserie: Or if these cankred foes (as most men say) So mighty be, that gird this wall of clay; What makes it hold so long, and threatned ruine stay? 10 When that great Lord his standing Court would build, The outward walls with gemmes and glorious lights, But inward rooms with nobler Courtiers fill'd; Pure, living flames, swift, mighty, blessed sprites: But some his royall service (fools!) disdain; So down were flung: (oft blisse is double pain) In heav'n they scorn'd to serve, so now in hell they reigne. 11 There turn'd to serpents, swoln with pride and hate, Their Prince a Dragon fell, who burst with spight To see this Kings and Queens yet happy state, Tempts them to lust and pride, prevails by slight: To make them wise, and gods he undertakes. Thus while the snake they heare, they turn to snakes; To make them gods he boasts, but beasts, and devils makes. 12 But that great Revel. 5. 5.Lion who in Fudahs plains The awfull beasts holds down in due subjection, The Dragons craft, and base-got spoil disdains, And folds this captive Prince in his protection; Luke. 4. 18.Breaks ope the jayl, &amp; brings the prisoners thence, Yet plac't them in this castles weak defence, Where they might trust and seek an higher providence. 13 So now spread round about this little hold, With armies infinite encamped lie Th' enraged Dragon and his Serpents bold: And knowing well his time grows short and nigh, He swells with venom'd gore and poys'nous heat; Revel.12.4.His tail unfolded heav'n it self doth beat, And sweeps the mighty starres from their transcendent seat. 14 With him goes The flesh. Caro, cursed damme of sinne, Foul filthie damme of fouler progenie; Yet seems (skin-deep) most fair by witching gin To weaker sight; but to a purged eye Looks like (nay worse then) hells infernall hagges: Her empty breasts hang like lank hollow bagges, And Iris ulcer'd skin is patcht with leprous ragges. 15 Therefore her loathsome shade in steel arayd, All rust within, the outside polisht bright: And on her shield a Mermaid sung and playd; Whose humane beauties 'lure the wandring sight, But slimy scales hid in their waters lie: She chants, she smiles, so draws the eare, the eye, And whom she winnes, she kills: the word, Heare, gaze, &amp; die. 16 And after march her fruitfull serpent frie, Whom she of divers lechers divers bore; Marshall'd in severall ranks their colours flie: The fruits of the flesh are described Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. and may be ranked into foure companies, 1. of Unchastitie. 2. of Irreligion. 3. of Unrighteous[n]esse. 4. of Intemperance.Foure to Anagnus, foure this painted whore To loathsome Asebie brought forth to light; Twice foure got Adicus, a hatefull wight; But swoln Acrates two, born in one bed, and night. 17 Adulterie. Gal. 5. 19. MÅchus the first, of blushlesse bold aspect; Yet with him Doubt and Fear still trembling go: Oft lookt he back, as if he did suspect Th' approach of some unwisht, unwelcome foe: Behinde, fell Jealousie his steps observ'd, And sure Revenge, with dart that never swerv'd: Ten thousand griefs and plagues he felt, but more deserv'd. 18 His armour black as hell, or starlesse night; And in his shield he lively pourtray'd bare Mars fast impound in arms of Venus light, And ti'd as fast in Vulcans subtil snare: She feign'd to blush for shame now all too late; But his red colour seem'd to sparkle hate: Sweet are stoln waters, round about the marge he wrate. 19 Fornication. Porneius next him pac't, a meager wight; Whose leaden eyes sunk deep in swimming head, And joylesse look, like some pale ashie spright, Seem'd as he now were dying, or now dead: And with him Wastefulnesse, that all expended, And Want, that still in theft and prison ended: A hundred foul diseases close at's back attended. 20 His shining helm might seem a sparkling flame, Yet sooth nought was it but a foolish fire: And all his arms were of that burning frame, That flesh and bones were gnawn with hot desire: About his wrist his blazing shield did frie With sweltring hearts in flame of luxurie: His word, In fire I live, in fire I burn and die. 21 With him Sodomie. Rom. 1. 26, 27. Levit. 20. 15, 16. Acatharus in Tuscan guise; A thing, that neither man will owne, nor beast: Upon a boy he lean'd in wanton wise, On whose fair limbes his eyes still greedie feast; He sports, he toyes, kisses his shining face: Behinde, reproach and thousand devils pace; Before, bold Impudence, that cannot change her grace. 22 His armour seem'd to laugh with idle boyes, Which all about their wanton sportings playd; Al's would himself help out their childish toyes, And like a boy lend them unmanly aid: In his broad targe the bird her wings dispread, Which trussing wafts the Trojan Ganymed: And round was writ, Like with his like is coupeled. 23 Lasciviousnesse. Aselges follow'd next, the boldest boy, That ever play'd in Venus wanton court: He little cares who notes his lavish joy; Broad were his jests, wilde his uncivil sport; His fashion too too fond, and loosly light: A long love-lock on his left shoulder plight, Like to a womans hair, well shew'd a womans sprite. 24 Lust in strange nests this Cuckoe egge conceiv'd; Which nurst with surfets, drest with fond disguises, In fancies school his breeding first receiv'd: So this brave spark to wilder flame arises; And now to court preferr'd, high blouds he fires, There blows up pride, vain mirths and loose desires; And heav'nly souls (oh grief!) with hellish flame inspires. 25 There oft to rivalls lends the gentle Dor, Oft takes (his mistresse by) the bitter Bob: There learns her each daies change of Gules, Verd, Or, (His sampler) if she pouts, her slave must sob: Her face his sphere, her hair his circling skie; Her love his heav'n, her sight eternitie: Of her he dreams, with her he lives, for her he'l die. 26 Upon his arm a tinsell scarf he wore, Forsooth his Madams favour, spangled fair: Light as himself, a fanne his helmet bore, With ribbons drest, begg'd from his Mistresse hair: On's shield a winged boy all naked shin'd; His folded eyes willing and wilfull blinde: The word was wrought with gold, Such is a lovers minde. 27 These foure, Anagnus and foul Caro's sonnes, Who led a diff'rent, and disorder'd rout; Fancie, a lad that all in feathers wons, And loose desire, and danger linkt with doubt; And thousand wanton thoughts still budding new: But lazie ease usher'd the idle crue; And lame disease shuts up their troops with torments due. 28 Next band by Asebie was boldly led, And his foure sonnes, begot in Stygian night: First Idolatrie, either by worshipping the true God by false worship; as by images, against the second commandment: or giving away his worship to any thing that is not God, against the first. Idololatros, whose monstrous head Was like an ugly fiend, his flaming sight Like blazing starres; the rest all different: For to his shape some part each creature lent, But to the great Creatour all adversly bent. 29 Upon his breast a bloudie Crosse he scor'd, Which oft he worshipt; but the Christ that di'd Thereon, he seldome but in paint ador'd; Yet wood, stone, beasts, wealth, lusts, fiends deifi'd: He makes meer pageants of the Psal. 62. 7.saving Rock, Puppet-like trimming his Almightie stock: Which then, his god or he, which is the verier block? 30 Of Giant shape, and strength thereto agreeing, Wherewith he whilome all the world opprest; And yet the greater part his vassals being, Slumbring in ignorance, securely rest: A golden calf (himself more beast) he bore; Which brutes with dancings, gifts, and songs adore: Idols are lay-mens books, he round had wrote in Ore. 31 Next Witchcraft and curious arts. Pharmacus, of gashly wilde aspect; Whom hell with seeming fear, and fiends obey: Full eas'ly would he know each past effect, And things to come with double guesse foresay, By slain beasts entrails, and fowls marked flight: Thereto he tempests rais'd by many a spright, And charm'd the Sunne and Moon, &amp; chang'd the day and night. 32 So when the South (dipping his sablest wings In humid Ocean) sweeps with 's dropping beard Th' aire, earth, and seas; his lips loud thunderings And flashing eyes make all the world afeard: Light with dark clouds, waters with fires are met: The Sunne but now is rising, now is set; And findes west-shades in East, and seas in ayers wet. 33 By birth, and hand, he jugling fortunes tells; Oft brings from shades his grandsires damned ghost; Oft stoln goods forces out by wicked spells: His frightfull shield with thousand fiends embost, Which seem'd without a circles ring to play: In midst himself dampens the smiling day, And prints sad characters, which none may write, or say. 34 The third Heresie. HÃ¦reticus, a wrangling carle, Who in the way to heav'n would wilfull erre; And oft convicted, still would snatch and snarle: His Crambe oft repeats; all tongue, no eare. Him Obstinacie, Pride, and Scorn attended: On's shield with Truth Errour disguis'd contended: His Motto this, Rather thus erre, then be amended. 35 Last marcht Hypocrisie, false form of grace, That vaunts the show of all, ha's truth of none: A rotten heart he masks with painted face; Among the beasts a mule, 'mong bees a drone, 'Mong starres a meteor: all the world neglects him; Nor good, nor bad, nor heav'n, nor earth affects him: The earth for glaring forms, for bare forms heav'n rejects him. 36 His wanton heart he vails with dewy eyes, So oft the world, and oft himself deceives: His tongue his heart, his hands his tongue belies: In's path (as snails) silver, but slime he leaves: He Babels glory is, but Sions taint; Religions blot, but Irreligions paint: A Saint abroad, at home a Fiend; and worst a Saint. 37 So tallow lights live glitt'ring, stinking die; Their gleams aggrate the sight, steams wound the smell: So Sodom apples please the ravisht eye, But sulphure taste proclaims their root's in hell: So airy flames to heav'nly seem alli'd; But when their oyl is spent, they swiftly glide, And into jelly'd mire melt all their gilded pride. 38 So rushes green, smooth, full, are spungie light; So their ragg'd stones in velvet peaches gown: So rotten sticks seem starres in cheating night; So quagmires false their mire with emeralds crown: Such is Hypocrisies deceitfull frame; A stinking light, a sulphure fruit, false flame, Smooth rush, hard peach, sere wood, false mire, a voice, a name. 39 Such were his arms, false gold, true alchymie; Glitt'ring with glassie stones, and fine deceit: His sword a flatt'ring steel, which gull'd the eye, And pierc't the heart with pride and self-conceit: On's shield a tombe, where death had drest his bed With curious art, and crown'd his loathsome head With gold, &amp; gems: his word, More gorgeous when dead. 40 Before them went their nurse, bold Ignorance; A loathsome monster, light, sight, 'mendment scorning: Born deaf and blinde, fitter to lead the dance To such a rout; her silver heads adorning (Her dotage index) much she bragg'd, yet feign'd: For by false tallies many yeares she gain'd. Wise youth is honour'd age; fond's age with dotage stain'd. 41 Her failing legges with erring footsteps reel'd; (Lame guide to blisse!) her daughters on each side Much pain'd themselves her stumbling feet to weeld; Both like their mother, dull and beetle-ey'd: The first was Errour false, who multiplies Her num'rous race in endlesse progenies: For but one truth there is, ten thousand thousand lies. 42 Her brood o're-spread her round with sinne and bloud, With envie, malice, mischiefs infinite; While she to see her self amazed stood, So often got with childe and bigge with spite: Her off-spring flie about &amp; spread their seed; Straight hate, pride, schisme, warres &amp; seditions breed, Get up, grow ripe. How soon prospers the vicious weed! 43 The other Owl-ey'd Superstition, Deform'd, distorted, blinde in shining light; Yet styles her self holy Devotion, And so is call'd, and seems in shadie night: Fearfull, as is the hare, or hunted hinde; Her face and breast she oft with crosses sign'd: No custome would she break, or change her setled minde. 44 If hare or snake her way, herself she crosses, And stops her 'mazed steps; sad fears affright her, When falling salt points out some fatall losses, Till Bacchus grapes with holy sprinkle quite her: Her onely bible is an Erra Pater; Her antidote are hallow'd wax and water: I' th' dark all lights are sprites, all noises chains that clatter. 45 With them marcht (sunk in deep securitie) Profanenesse, to be fear'd for never fearing; And by him, new-oaths-coyning Blasphemie, Who names not God, but in a curse, or swearing: And thousand other fiends in diverse fashion, Dispos'd in severall ward, and certain station: Under, Hell widely yawn'd; and over, flew Damnation. 46 Next Adicus his sonnes; first Hatred. Ecthros slie, Whose prickt-up eares kept open house for lies; And [f]leering eyes still watch and wait to spie When to return still-living injuries: Fair weather smil'd upon his painted face, And eyes spoke peace, till he had time and place; Then poures down showers of rage, and streams of rancour base. 47 So when a sable cloud with swelling sail Comes swimming through calm skies, the silent aire (While fierce windes sleep in Ãols rockie jayl) With spangled beams embroid'red, glitters fair; But soon 'gins lowr: straight clatt'ring hail is bred, Scatt'ring cold shot; light hides his golden head, And with untimely winter earth's o're-silvered. 48 His arms well suit his minde, where smiling skies Breed thund'ring tempests: on his loftie crest Asleep the spotted Panther couching lies, And by sweet sents and skinne so quaintly drest, Draws on her prey: upon his shield he bears The dreadfull monster which great Nilus fears; (The weeping Crocadile) his word, I kill with tears. 49 With him Dissemblance went, his Paramour, Whose painted face might hardly be detected: Arms of offence he seld' or never wore, Lest thence his close designes might be suspected; But clasping close his foe, as loth to part, He steals his dagger with false smiling art, And sheaths the trait'rous steel in his own masters heart. 50 Two Fewish Captains, close themselves enlacing In loves sweet twines, his target broad display'd; One th' others beard with his left hand embracing, But in his right a shining sword he sway'd, Which unawares through th' others ribs he smites; There lay the wretch without all buriall rites: His word, He deepest wounds, that in his fawning bites. 51 Variance. Eris the next, of sex unfit for warre: Her arms were bitter words from flaming tongue, Which never quiet, wrangle, fight, and jarre; Ne would she weigh report with right, or wrong: What once she held, that would she ever hold, And Non-obstantes force with courage bold: The last word must she have, or never leave to scold. 52 She is the trumpet to this angrie train, And whets their furie with loud-railing spite: But when no open foes did more remain, Against themselves themselves she would incite. Her clacking mill, driv'n by her flowing gall, Could never stand, but chide, rail, bark, and bawl: Her shield no word could finde; her tongue engrost them all. 53 Emulation. Zelos the third, whose spitefull emulation Could not endure a fellow in excelling; Yet slow in any vertues imitation, At easie rate that fair possession selling: Still as he went, he hidden sparkles blew, Till to a mighty flame they sudden grew, And like fierce lightning all in quick destruction drew. 54 Upon his shield lay that Tirinthian Swain, Sweltring in fierie gore and pois'nous flame; His wives sad gift venom'd with bloudie stain: Well could he bulls, snake[s,] hell, all monsters tame; Well could he heav'n support and prop alone; But by fell Jealousie soon overthrown, Without a foe, or sword: his motto, First, or none. 55 Wrath. Thumos the fourth, a dire, revengefull swain; Whose soul was made of flames, whose flesh of fire: Wrath in his heart, hate, rage and furie reigne; Fierce was his look, when clad in sparkling tire; But when dead palenesse in his cheek took seisure, And all the bloud in's boyling heart did treasure, Then in his wilde revenge kept he nor mean, nor measure. 56 Look as when waters wall'd with brazen wreath Are sieg'd with crackling flames, their common foe; The angrie seas 'gin foam and hotly breathe, Then swell, rise, rave, and still more furious grow; Nor can be held, but forc't with fires below, Tossing their waves, break out and all o'reflow: So boyl'd his rising bloud, and dasht his angry brow. 57 For in his face red heat, and ashie cold Strove which should paint revenge in proper colours: That, like consuming fire, most dreadfull roll'd; This, liker death, threatens all deadly dolours: His trembling hand a dagger still embrac't, Which in his friend he rashly oft encas't: His shields devise fresh bloud with foulest stain defac't. 58 Next him Strife. Erithius, most unquiet swain, That all in law and fond contention spent; Not one was found in all this numerous train, With whom in any thing he would consent: His Will his Law, he weigh'd not wrong or right; Much scorn'd to bear, much more forgive a spight: Patience he th' asses load, and cowards Vertue hight. 59 His weapons all were fram'd of shining gold, Wherewith he subt'ly fought close under hand: Thus would he right from right by force withhold, Nor suits, nor friends, nor laws his slights withstand: Ah powerfull weapon! how dost thou bewitch Great, but base mindes, &amp; spott'st with leprous itch, That never are in thought, nor ever can be rich! 60 Upon his belt (fastned with leather laces) Black boxes hung, sheaths of his paper-swords; Fill'd up with Writs, Sub-pÅna's, Triall-cases; This trespast him in cattel, that in words: Fit his device, and well his shield became, A Salamander drawn in lively frame: His word was this, I live, I breathe, I feed in flame. 61 Next after him marcht proud Sedition or Schisme. Dichostasis, That wont but in the factious court to dwell; But now to shepherd-swains close linked is; And taught them (fools!) to change their humble cell, And lowly weed for courts, and purple gay, To sit aloft, and States and Princes sway: A hook, no scepter needs our erring sheep to stay. 62 A Miter trebly crown'd th' Impostour wore; For heav'n, earth, hell he claims with loftie pride. Not in his lips, but hands, two keyes he bore, Heav'ns doores and hells to shut, and open wide: But late his keyes are marr'd, or broken quite: For hell he cannot shut, but opens light; Nor heav'n can ope, but shut; nor buyes, but sells by slight. 63 Two heads, oft three, he in one body had, Nor with the body, nor themselves agreeing: What this commanded, th' other soon forbad; As different in rule, as nature being: The body to them both, and neither prone, Was like a double-hearted dealer grown; Endeavouring to please both parties, pleasing none. 64 As when the powerfull winde and adverse tide Strive which should most command the subject main; The scornfull waves, swelling with angrie pride, Yeelding to neither, all their force disdain: Mean time the shaken vessel doubtfull playes, And on the stagg'ring billow trembling stayes, And would obey them both, and none of both obeyes. 65 A subtil craftsman fram'd him seemly arms, Forg'd in the shop of wrangling sophistrie; And wrought with curious arts, and mightie charms, Temper'd with lies, and false philosophie: Millions of heedlesse souls thus had he slain. His sev'n-fold targe a field of Gules did stain; In which two swords he bore: his word, Divide, and reigne. 66 Envie the next, Envie with squinted eyes; Sick of a strange disease, his neighbours health: Best lives he then, when any better dies; Is never poore, but in anothers wealth: On best mens harms and griefs he feeds his fill; Else his own maw doth eat with spitefull will. Ill must the temper be, where diet is so ill. 67 Each eye through divers opticks slily leers, Which both his sight, and object self belie; So greatest vertue as a mote appeares, And molehill faults to mountains multiplie. When needs he must, yet faintly, then he praises; Somewhat the deed, much more the means he raises: So marreth what he makes, &amp; praising most dispraises. 68 Upon his shield that cruell Herd-groom play'd, Fit instrument of Funo's jealous spight; His hundred eyes stood fixed on the maid; He pip't, she sigh'd: his word, Her day my night. His missile weapon was a lying tongue, Which he farre off like swiftest lightning flung, That all the world with noise &amp; foul blaspheming rung. 69 Last of this rout the savage Murder. Phonos went, Whom his dire mother nurst with humane bloud; And when more age and strength more fiercenesse lent, She taught him in a dark and desert wood With force and guile poore passengers to slay, And on their flesh his barking stomack stay, And with their wretched bloud his firy thirst allay. 70 So when the never-setled Scythian Removes his dwelling in an empty wain; When now the Sunne hath half his journey ranne, His horse he blouds, and pricks a trembling vein, So from the wound quenches his thirstie heat: Yet worse, this fiend makes his own flesh his meat. Monster! the ravenous beare his kinde will never eat. 71 Ten thousand Furies on his steps awaited; Some sear'd his hardned soul with Stygian brand: Some with black terrours his faint conscience baited, That wide he star'd, and starched hair did stand: The first-born man still in his minde he bore, Foully aray'd in guiltlesse brothers gore, Which for revenge to heav'n from earth did loudly roar. 72 His arms offensive all, to spill, not spare; Swords, pistols, poisons, instruments of hell: A shield he wore (not that the wretch did care To save his flesh, oft he himself would quell) For shew, not use: on it a viper swilling The dammes spilt gore, his emptie bowels filling With flesh that gave him life: his word, I live by killing. 73 And last his brutish sonnes Acrates sent, Whom Caro bore both in one birth and bed; Drunkennesse. Methos the first, whose panch his feet out-went, As if it usher'd his unsetled head: His soul quite sowced lay in grapie bloud; In all his parts the idle dropsie stood; Which, though alreadie drown'd, still thirsted for the floud. 74 This thing, nor man, nor beast, tunnes all his wealth In drink; his dayes, his yeares in liquour drenching: So quaffes he sicknesse down by quaffing health, Firing his cheeks with quenching, strangely quenching His eyes with firing; dull and faint they roll'd: But nimble lips known things, and hid unfold; Belchings, oft-sips, large spits point the long tale he told. 75 His armour green might seem a fruitfull vine; The clusters prison'd in the close-set leaves, Yet oft between the bloudie grape did shine; And peeping forth, his jaylers spite deceives: Among the boughs did swilling Bacchus ride, Whom wilde-grown M[Ã¦]nads bore, and every stride Bacche, IÃ´ Bacche, loud with madding voice they cri'd. 76 On's shield the goatish Satyres dance around, (Their heads much lighter then their nimble heels) Silenus old, in wine (as ever) drown'd, Clos'd with the ring, in midst (though sitting) reels: Under his arm a bag-pipe swoln he held, (Yet wine-swoln cheeks the windie bag out-swell'd) So loudly pipes: his word, But full, no mirth I yeeld. 77 Insatiate sink, how with so generall stain Thy spu'd-out puddles court, town, fields entice! Ay me! the shepherds selves thee entertain, And to thy Curtian gulph do sacrifice: All drink to spue, and spue again to drink. Sowre swil-tub sinne, of all the rest the sink, How canst thou thus bewitch with thy abhorred stink? 78 The eye thou wrong'st with vomits reeking streams, The eare with belching; touch thou drown'st in wine; The taste thou surfet'st; smell with spuing steams Thou woundest: foh! thou loathsome putrid swine, Still thou increasest thirst, when thirst thou slakest; The minde and will thou (wits bane) captive takest: Senseles thy hoggish filth, &amp; sense thou senseles makest. 79 Thy fellow sinnes, and all the rest of vices With seeming good are fairly cloath'd to sight; Their feigned sweet the bleare-ey'd will entices, Coz'ning the daz'led sense with borrow'd light: Thee neither true, nor yet false good commends; Profit nor pleasure on thy steps attends: Folly begins thy sinne, which still with madnesse ends. 80 With Methos, Gluttonie, his gutling brother, Twinne parallels, drawn from the self-same line; So foully like was either to the other, And both most like a monstrous-panched swine: His life was either a continu'd feast, Whose surfets upon surfets him opprest; Or heavie sleep, that helps so great a load digest. 81 Mean time his soul, weigh'd down with muddie chains, Can neither work, nor move in captive bands; But dull'd in vaprous fogges, all carelesse reignes, Or rather serves strong appetites commands: That when he now was gorg'd with cramm'd-down store, And porter wanting room had shut the doore, The glutton sigh'd that he could gurmandize no more. 82 His crane-like neck was long unlac'd; his breast, His gowtie limbes, like to a circle round, As broad as long; and for his spear in rest Oft with his staffe he beats the yeelding ground; Wherewith his hands did help his feet to bear, Els would they ill so huge a burthen stear: His clothes were all of leaves, no armour could he wear. 83 Onely a target light upon his arm He carelesse bore, on which old Gryll was drawn, Transform'd into a hog with cunning charm; In head, and paunch, and soul it self a brawn: Half drown'd within, without, yet still did hunt In his deep trough for swill, as he was wont; Cas'd all in loathsome mire: no word; Gryll could but grunt. 84 Him serv'd sweet-seeming lusts, self-pleasing lies; But bitter death flow'd from those sweets of sinne: And at the Rear of these in secret guise Crept Theeverie, and Detraction, neare akinne; No twinnes more like: they seem'd almost the same; One stole the goods, the other the good name: The latter lives in scorn, the former dies in shame. 85 Their boon companions in their joviall feasting Were new-shapt oaths, and damning perjuries: Their cates, fit for their taste, profanest jesting, Sauc'd with the salt of hell, dire blasphemies. But till th' ambitious Sunne, yet still aspiring, Allayes his flaming gold with gentler firing, We'l rest our wearie song in that thick groves retiring. CANT. VIII. 1 The Sunne began to slack his bended bow, And more obliquely dart his milder ray; When cooler ayers gently 'gan to blow, And fanne the fields parcht with the scorching day: The shepherds to their wonted seats repair; Thirsil, refresht with this soft-breathing aire, Thus 'gan renew his task, and broken song repair: 2 What watchfull care must fence that weary state, Which deadly foes begirt with cruell siege; And frailest wall of glasse, and trait'rous gate Strive which should first yeeld up their wofull leige? By enemies assail'd, by friends betray'd; When others hurt, himself refuses aid: By weaknesse self his strength is foil'd and overlay'd. 3 How comes it then that in so neare decay We deadly sleep in deep securitie, When every houre is ready to betray Our lives to that still-watching enemie? Wake then thy soul that deadly slumbereth: For when thy foe hath seiz'd thy captive breath, Too late to wish past life, too late to wish for death. 4 Caro the Vantguard with the Dragon led, The World or Mammon. Cosmos the battell guides, with loud alarms; Cosmos, the first sonne to the Dragon red, Shining in seeming gold, and glitt'ring arms: Well might he seem a strong and gentle Knight, As e're was clad in steel and armour bright; But was a recreant base, a foul, false, cheating sprite. 5 And as himself, such were his arms; appearing Bright burnisht gold, indeed base alchymie, Dimme beetle eyes, and greedy worldlings blearing: His shield was drest in nights sad liverie, Where man-like Apes a Gloworm compasse round, Glad that in wintrie night they fire had found; Busie they puffe &amp; blow: the word, Mistake the ground. 6 Mistake points all his darts; his sunshines bright (Mistaken) light appeare, sad lightning prove: His clouds (mistook) seem lightnings, turn to light; His love true hatred is, his hatred love; His shop, a Pedlers pack of apish fashion; His honours, pleasures, joyes are all vexation: His wages, glorious care, sweet surfets, woo'd damnation. 7 His lib'rall favours, complementall arts; His high advancements, Alpine slipp'ry straits; His smiling glances, deaths most pleasing darts; And (what he vaunts) his gifts are gilded baits: Indeed he nothing is, yet all appeares. Haplesse earths happy fools, that know no tears! Who bathes in worldly joyes, swimmes in a world of fears. 8 Pure Essence, who hast made a stone descrie 'Twixt natures hid, and check that metals pride That dares aspire to golds high soveraigntie; Ah leave some touch-stone erring eyes to guide, And judge dissemblance; see by what devices Sinne with fair glosse our mole-ey'd sight entises, That vices vertues seem to most; and vertues, vices. 9 Strip thou their meretricious seemlinesse, And tinfold glitt'ring bare to every sight, That we may loath their inward uglinesse; Or else uncloud the soul, whose shadie light Addes a fair lustre to false earthly blisse: Thine and their beauty differs but in this; Theirs what it is not, seems; thine seems not what it is. 10 Next to the Captain coward Fearfulnesse. Deilos far'd; Him right before he as his shield projected, And following troops to back him as his guard; Yet both his shield and guard (faint heart) suspected: And sending often back his doubtfull eye, By fearing taught unthought of treacherie; So made him enemies, by fearing enmitie. 11 Still did he look for some ensuing crosse, Fearing such hap as never man befell: No mean he knows, but dreads each little losse (With tyrannie of fear distraught) as hell. His sense he dare not trust, (nor eyes, nor eares) And when no other cause of fright appeares, Himself he much suspects, and fears his causelesse fears. 12 Harnest with massie steel, for fence, not fight; His sword unseemly long he ready drew: At sudden shine of his own armour bright He started oft, and star'd with ghastly hue: He shrieks at every danger that appeares, Shaming the knightly arms he goodly bears: His word, Safer that all, then he that nothing fears. 13 With him went Doubt, stagg'ring with steps unsure, That every way, and neither way enclin'd; And fond Distrust, whom nothing could secure; Suspicion lean, as if he never din'd: He keeps intelligence by thousand spies; Argus to him bequeath'd his hundred eyes: So waking still he sleeps, and sleeping wakefull lies. 14 Fond Deilos all, Overboldnesse, or foolhardinesse. Tolmetes nothing fears; Just frights he laughs, all terrours counteth base; And when of danger, or sad news he heares, He meets the thund'ring fortune face to face: Yet oft in words he spends his boistrous threat; That his hot bloud, driv'n from the native seat, Leaves his The Philosopher rightly calls such ???????????? Ethic. 3. cap. 7. not onely foolhardy, but fainthardy.faint coward heart empty of lively heat. 15 Himself (weak help!) was all his confidence; He scorns low ebs, but swimmes in highest rises: His limbes with arms or shield he would not fence; Such coward fashion (fool!) he much despises: Ev'n for his single sword the world seems scant; For hundred worlds his conqu'ring arm could dant: Much would he boldly do, but much more boldly vant. 16 With him went self-admiring Arrogance, And Bragge, his deeds without an helper praising: Blinde Carelesnesse before would lead the dance; Fear stole behinde, those vaunts in balance peysing, Which farre their deeds outweigh'd; their violence, 'Fore danger spent with lavish diffluence, Was none, or weak in time of greatest exigence. 17 As when a fierie courser readie bent, Puts forth himself at first with swiftest pace; Till with too sudden flash his spirits spent, Alreadie fails now in the middle race: His hanging crest farre from his wonted pride, No longer now obeyes his angrie guide; Rivers of sweat and bloud flow from his gored side: 18 Thus ran the rash Tolmetes, never viewing The fearfull fiends that duly him attended; Destruction close his steps in poast pursuing, And certain ruines heavie weights depended Over his cursed head, and smooth-fac'd guile, That with him oft would loosly play and smile; Till in his snare he lockt his feet with treach'rous wile. 19 Next marcht Prodigalitie. Asotus, carelesse-spending Swain; Who with a fork went spreading all around, Which his old sire with sweating toil and pain Long time was raking from his racked ground: In giving he observ'd nor form, nor matter, Arist. Eth. 4.But best reward he got, that best could flatter; Thus what he thought to give, he did not give, but scatter. 20 Before aray'd in sumptuous braverie, Deckt court-like in the choice and newest guise; But all behinde like drudging slaverie, With ragged patches, rent, and bared thighs: His shamefull parts, that shunne the hated light, Were naked left; (ah foul unhonest sight!) Yet neither could he see, nor feel his wretched plight. 21 His shield presents to life deaths latest rites, A sad black herse born up with sable swains; Which many idle grooms with hundred lights (Tapers, lamps, torches) usher through the plains To endlesse darknesse; while the Sunnes bright brow With fierie beams quenches their smoaking tow, And wastes their idle cost: the word, Not need, but show. 22 A vagrant rout (a shoal of tatling daws) Strow him with vain-spent prayers, and idle layes; And flatt'rie to his sinne close curtains draws, Clawing his itching eare with tickling praise: Behinde, fond pitie much his fall lamented, And miserie, that former waste repented: The usurer for his goods, jayl for his bones indented. 23 His steward was his kinsman, Vain-expence, Who proudly strove in matters light to shew Heroick minde in braggard affluence; So lost his treasure, getting nought in liew, But ostentation of a foolish pride; While women fond, and boyes stood gaping wide; But wise men all his waste and needlesse cost deride. 24 Next Covetousnesse. Pleonectes went, his gold admiring, His servants drudge, slave to his basest slave; Never enough, and still too much desiring: His gold his god, yet in an iron grave Himself protects his god from noysome rusting; Much fears to keep, much more to loose his lusting; Himself, and golden god, and every god mistrusting. 25 Age on his hairs the winter snow had spread; That silver badge his neare end plainly proves: Yet as to Arist. Eth.earth he nearer bowes his head, So loves it more; for Like his like still loves. Deep from the ground he digs his sweetest gain, And deep into the earth digs back with pain: From hell his gold he brings, and hoords in hell again. 26 His clothes all patcht with more then honest thrift, And clouted shoon were nail'd for fear of wasting; Fasting he prais'd, but sparing was his drift; And when he eats, his food is worse then fasting: Thus starves in store, thus doth in plentie pine, Thus wallowing on his god, his heap of Mine, He feeds his famisht soul with that deceiving shine. 27 Oh hungrie metall, false deceitfull ray, Well laid'st thou dark, prest in th' earths hidden wombe; Yet through our mothers entrails cutting way, We dragge thy buried coarse from hellish tombe: The merchant from his wife and home departs, Nor at the swelling ocean ever starts; While death &amp; life a wall of thinne planks onely parts. 28 Who was it first, that from thy deepest cell, With so much costly toil and painfull sweat Durst rob thy palace, bord'ring next to hell? Well mayst thou come from that infernall seat; Thou all the world with hell-black deeps dost fill. Fond men, that with such pain do wooe your ill! Needlesse to send for grief, for he is next us still. 29 His arms were light, and cheap, as made to save His purse, not limbes; the money, not the man: Rather he dies, then spends: his helmet brave, An old brasse pot; breast-plate a dripping-pan: His spear a spit, a pot-lid broad his shield, Whose smokie plain a chalkt Impresa fill'd, A bagge sure seal'd: his word, Much better sav'd, then spill'd. 30 By Pleonectes shamelesse Sparing went, Who whines and weeps to beg a longer day, Yet with a thundring voice claims tardie rent; Quick to receive, but hard and slow to pay: His care's to lessen cost with cunning base; But when he's forc't beyond his bounded space, Loud would he crie, &amp; howl, while others laugh apace. 31 Long after went Feeblemindednesse. Pusillus, weakest heart, Able to serve, and able to command, But thought himself unfit for either part; And now full loth, amidst the warlike band Was hither drawn by force from quiet cell: Lonenesse his heav'n, and bus'nesse was his hell. A weak distrustfull heart is vertues aguish spell. 32 His goodly arms, eaten with shamefull rust, Bewray'd their masters ease, and want of using; Such was his minde, tainted with idle must, His goodly gifts with little use abusing: Upon his shield was drawn that noble Swain That loth to change his love and quiet reigne For glorious warlike deeds, did craftie madnesse feigne. 33 Finely the workman fram'd the toilsome plough Drawn with an ox and asse, unequall pair; While he with busie hand his salt did sow, And at the furrows end his dearest heir Did helplesse lie, and Greek lords watching still Observ'd his hand guided with carefull will: About was wrote, Who nothing doth, doth nothing ill. 34 By him went Idlenesse, his loved friend, And Shame with both; with all, ragg'd Povertie: Behinde sure Punishment did close attend, Waiting a while fit opportunitie; And taking count of houres mispent in vain, And graces lent without returning gain, Pour'd on his guiltie corse late grief, &amp; helplesse pain. 35 This dull cold earth with standing water froze; At ease he lies to coyn pretence for ease; His soul like Ahaz diall, while it goes Not forward, poasteth backward ten degrees: In's couch he's pliant wax for fiends to seal; He never sweats, but in his bed, or meal: He'd rather steal then work, and beg then strive to steal. 36 All opposite, though he his brother were, Was Arrogancie. Chaunus, that too high himself esteem'd: All things he undertook, nor could he fear His power too weak, or boasted strength misdeem'd, With his own praise like windie bladder blown: His eyes too little, or too much his own; For The arrogant are more stupid. Arist.Ethic. 4. known to all men weak, was to himself unknown. 37 Fondly himself with praising he disprais'd, Vaunting his deeds and worth with idle breath; So raz'd himself, what he himself had rais'd: On's shield a boy threatens high PhÅbus death, Aiming his arrow at his purest light; But soon the thinne reed, fir'd with lightning bright, Fell idlely on the strond: his word, Yet high, and right. 38 Next brave Ambition. Philotimus in poast did ride: Like rising ladders was his climbing minde; His high-flown thoughts had wings of courtly pride, Which by foul rise to greatest height enclin'd; His heart aspiring swell'd untill it burst: But when he gain'd the top, with spite accurst Down would he fling the steps by which he clamb'red first. 39 His head's a shop furnisht with looms of state: His brain the weaver, thoughts are shuttles light, With which in spite of heav'n he weaves his fate; Honour his web: thus works he day and night, Till fates cut off his threed; so heapeth sinnes And plagues, nor once enjoyes the place he winnes; But where his old race ends, there his new race begins. 40 Ah silly man, who dream'st that honour stands In ruling others, not thy self! thy slaves Serve thee, and thou thy slaves: in iron bands Thy servile spirit prest with wilde passions raves. Would'st thou live honour'd? clip ambitions wing; To reasons yoke thy furious passions bring. Thrice noble is the man, who of himself is King. 41 Upon his shield was fram'd that vent'rous lad, That durst assay the Sunnes bright-flaming team; Spite of his feeble hands, the horses mad Fling down on burning earth the scorching beam; So made the flame in which himself was fir'd; The world the bonefire was, where he expir'd: His motto written thus, Yet had what he desir'd. 42 But Basenesse of minde. Atimus, a carelesse idle swain, Though Glory off'red him her sweet embrace, And fair Occasion with little pain Reacht him her ivory hand, yet (lozel base!) Rather his way, and her fair self declin'd; Well did he thence prove his degenerous minde: Base were his restie thoughts, base was his dunghill kinde. 43 And now by force dragg'd from the monkish cell, (Where teeth he onely us'd, nor hands, nor brains, But in smooth streams swam down through ease to hell; His work to eat, drink, sleep, and purge his reins) He left his heart behinde him with his feast: His target with a flying dart was drest, Poasting unto his mark: the word, I move to rest. 44 Next Flatterie. Colax all his words with sugar spices; His servile tongue, base slave to greatnesse name, Runnes nimble descant on the plainest vices; He lets his tongue to sinne, takes rent of shame: He temp'ring lies, porter to th' eare resides, Like Indian apple, which with painted sides, More dangerous within his lurking poyson hides. 45 So Echo, to the voice her voice conforming, From hollow breast for one will two repay; So, like the rock it holds, it self transforming, That subtil fish hunts for her heedlesse prey: So crafty fowlers with their fair deceits Allure the hungrie bird; so fisher waits To bait himself with fish, his hook and fish with baits. 46 His art is but to hide, not heal a sore, To nourish pride, to strangle conscience; To drain the rich, his own drie pits to store, To spoil the precious soul, to please vile sense: A carrion crow he is, a gaping grave, The rich coats moth, the courts bane, trenchers slave; Sinnes &amp; hells winning baud, the devils fact'ring knave. 47 A mist he casts before his patrons sight, That blackest vices never once appeare; But greater then it is, seems vertues light; His Lords displeasure is his onely fear: His clawing lies, tickling the senses frail To death, make open way where force would fail. Lesse hurts the lions paw, then foxes softest tail. 48 His arms with hundred tongues were poud'red gay, (The mint of lies) gilt, fil'd, the sense to please; His sword which in his mouth close sheathed lay, Sharper then death, and fram'd to kill with ease. Ah cursed weapon, life with pleasure spilling! The Sardoin herb with many branches filling His shield, was his device: the word, I please in killing. 49 Base slave! how crawl'st thou from thy dunghill nest, Where thou wast hatcht by shame and beggerie, And pearchest in the learn'd and noble breast? Nobles of thee their courtship learn, of thee Arts learn new art their learning to adorn: (Ah wretched mindes!) He is not nobly born, Nor learn'd, that doth not thy ignoble learning scorn. 50 Close to him Pleasing went, with painted face, And Honour, by some hidden cunning made; Not Honours self, but Honours semblance base, For soon it vanisht like an emptie shade: Behinde, his parents duely him attend; With them he forced is his age to spend: Shame his beginning was, and shame must be his end. 51 Next follow'd Morositie. Dyscolus, a froward wight; His lips all swoln, and eyebrows ever bent, With sootie locks, swart looks, and scouling sight, His face a tell-tale to his foul intent: He nothing lik't, or prais'd; but reprehended What every one beside himself commended. Humours of tongues impostum'd, purg'd with shame, are mended. 52 His mouth a pois'nous quiver, where he hides Sharp venom'd arrows, which his bitter tongue With squibs, carps, jests, unto their object guides; Nor fears he gods on earth, or heav'n to wrong: Upon his shield was fairly drawn to sight A raging dog, foaming out wrath and spite: The word to his device, Impartiall all I bite. 53 Mad laughter. Eccles. 2. 2. Geloios next ensu'd, a merrie Greek, Whose life was laughter vain, and mirth misplac't; His speeches broad, to shame the modest cheek; Ne car'd he whom, or when, or how disgrac't. Salt round about he flung upon the sand; If in his way his friend or father stand, His father &amp; his friend he spreads with carelesse hand. 54 His foul jests steep'd and drown'd in laughter vain, And rotten speech, (ah!) was not mirth, but madnesse: His armour crackling thorns all flaming stain With golden fires, (embleme of foppish gladnesse) Upon his shield two laughing fools you see, (In number he the third, first in degree) At which himself would laugh, and fleer: his word, We three. 55 And after, Rusticitie, or feritie. Agrios, a sullen swain, All mirth that in himself and others hated; Dull, dead, and leaden was his cheerlesse vein: His weary sense he never recreated; And now he marcht as if he somewhat dream'd: All honest joy but madnesse he esteem'd, Refreshings idlenesse, but sport he folly deem'd. 56 In's arms his minde the workman fit exprest, Which all with quenched lamps, but smoking yet, And foully stinking, were full queintly drest; To blinde, not light the eyes, to choke, not heat: Upon his shield an heap of fennie mire In flagges and turfs (with sunnes yet never drier) Did smoth'ring lie, not burn: his word, Smoke without fire. 57 Last Impudence, whose never-changing face Knew but one colour; with some brasse-brow'd lie, And laughing loud she drowns her just disgrace: About her all the fiends in armies flie: Her feather'd beaver sidelong cockt, in guise Of roaring boyes; set look with fixed eyes Out-looks all shamefac't forms, all modestie defies. 58 And as her thoughts, so arms all black as hell: Her brasen shield two sable dogs adorn, Who each at other stare, and snarle, and swell: Beneath the word was set, All change I scorn. But if I all this rout and foul aray Should muster up, and place in battell ray, Too long your selves &amp; flocks my tedious song would stay. 59 The aged day growes dimme, and-homeward calls: The parting Sunne (mans state describing well) Falls when he rises, rises when he falls: So we by falling rose, by rising fell. The shadie cloud of night 'gins softly creep, And all our world with sable tincture steep: Home now ye shepherd-swains; home now my loved sheep. CANT. IX. 1 The Bridegroom Sunne, who late the Earth had spous'd, Leaves his star-chamber; early in the East He shook his sparkling locks, head lively rouz'd, While Morn his couch with blushing roses drest; His shines the Earth soon latcht to gild her flowers: Phosphor his gold-fleec't drove folds in their bowers, Which all the night had graz'd about th' Olympick towers. 2 The cheerfull Lark, mounting from early bed, With sweet salutes awakes the drowsie light; The earth she left, and up to heav'n is fled; There chants her Makers praises out of sight: Earth seems a molehill, men but ants to be; Teaching proud men, that soar to high degree, The farther up they climbe, the lesse they seem, and see: 3 The shepherds met, and Thomalin began; Young Thomalin, whose notes and silver string Silence the rising Lark, and falling Swan: Come Thirsil, end thy lay, and cheerly sing: Hear'st how the Larks give welcome to the day, Temp'ring their sweetest notes unto thy lay? Up then, thou loved swain; why dost thou longer stay? 4 Well sett'st thou (friend) the Lark before mine eyes, Much easier to heare then imitate: Her wings lift up her notes to loftie skies; But me a leaden sleep, and earthly state Down to the centre ties with captive string: Well might I follow here her note and wing; Singing she loftie mounts: ah! mounting should I sing. 5 Oh thou dread King of that heroick band, Which by thy power beats back these hellish sprites, Rescuing this State from death and base command; Tell me, (dread King) what are those warlike Knights? What force? what arms? where lies their strengths increase, That though so few in number, never cease To keep this sieged town 'gainst numbers numberlesse? 6 The first Commanders in this holy train, Leaders to all the rest, an ancient pair; Long since sure linkt in wedlocks sweetest chain; His name Spiritto, she Heaven. Urania fair: Fair had she been, and full of heav'nly grace, And he in youth a mightie warrier was, Both now more fair, &amp; strong; which prov'd their heav'nly race. 7 His arms with flaming tongues all sparkled bright, Bright flaming tongues, in divers sections parted; His piercing sword, edg'd with their firy light, 'Twixt bones and marrow, soul and spirit disparted: Upon his shield was drawn a glorious Dove, 'Gainst whom the proudest Eagle dares not move; Glitt'ring in beams: his word, Conqu'ring by peace and love. 8 But she Amazon-like in azure arms, Silver'd with starres, and gilt with sunnie rayes, Her mighty Spouse in fight and fierce alarms Attends, and equals in these bloudie frayes; And on her shield an heav'nly globe (displaying The constellations lower bodies swaying, Sway'd by the higher) she bore: her word, I rule obeying. 9 About them swarm'd their fruitfull progenie; An heav'nly off-spring of an heav'nly bed: Well mought you in their looks his stoutnesse see With her sweet graces lovely tempered. Fit youth they seem'd to play in Princes hall, (But ah long since they thence were banisht all) Or shine in glitt'ring arms, when need fierce warre doth call. 10 The first in order (nor in worth the last) Is Knowledge, drawn from peace and Muses spring; Where shaded in fair Sinaies groves, his taste He feasts with words and works of heav'nly King; But now to bloudy field is fully bent: Yet still he seem'd to study as he went: His arms cut all in books; strong shield slight papers lent. 11 His glitt'ring armour shin'd like burning day, Garnisht with golden Sunnes, and radiant flowers; Which turn their bending heads to PhÅbus ray, And when he falls, shut up their leavie bowers: Upon his shield the silver Moon did bend Her horned bow, and round her arrows spend: His word in silver wrote, I borrow what I lend. 12 All that he saw, all that he heard, were books, In which he read and learn'd his Makers will: Most on his word, but much on heav'n he looks, And thence admires with praise the workmans skill. Close to him went still-musing Contemplation, That made good use of ills by meditation; So to him ill it self was good by strange mutation. 13 And Care, who never from his sides would part, Of knowledge oft the waies and means enquiring, To practise what he learnt from holy art; And oft with tears, and oft with sighs desiring Aid from that Soveraigne Guide, whose wayes so steep, Though fain he would, yet weak he could not keep: But when he could not go, yet forward would he creep. 14 Next Humilitie. Tapinus, whose sweet, though lowly grace All other higher then himself esteem'd; He in himself priz'd things as mean and base, Which yet in others great and glorious seem'd: All ill due debt, good undeserv'd he thought; His heart a low-rooft house, but sweetly wrought, Where God himself would dwell, though he it dearly bought. 15 Honour he shunnes, yet is the way unto him; As hell, he hates advancement wonne with bribes; But publick place and charge are forc't to wooe him; He good to grace, ill to desert ascribes: Him (as his Lord) contents a lowly room, Whose first house was the blessed Virgins wombe, The next a cratch, the third a crosse, the fourth a tombe. 16 So choicest drugs in meanest shrubs are found; So precious gold in deepest centre dwells: So sweetest violets trail on lowly ground; So richest pearls ly clos'd in vilest shells: So lowest dales we let at highest rates; So creeping strawberries yeeld daintiest cates. The Highest highly loves the low, the loftie hates. 17 Upon his shield was drawn that Shepherd lad, Who with a sling threw down faint Israels fears; And in his hand his spoils, and trophies glad, The Monsters sword and head, he bravely bears: Plain in his lovely face you might behold A blushing meeknesse met with courage bold: Little, not little worth, was fairly wrote in gold. 18 With him his kinsman both in birth and name, Obedience, taught by many bitter showers In humble bonds his passions proud to tame, And low submit unto the higher powers: But yet no servile yoke his forehead brands; For ti'd in such an holy service bands, In this obedience rules, and serving thus commands. 19 By them went Faith. Fido, Marshal of the field: Weak was his mother, when she gave him day; And he at first a sick and weakly childe, As e're with tears welcom'd the sunnie ray: Yet when more yeares afford more growth, &amp; might, A champion stout he was, and puissant Knight, As ever came in field, or shone in armour bright. 20 So may we see a little lionet, When newly whelpt, a weak and tender thing, Despis'd by every beast; but waxen great, When fuller times full strength and courage bring, The beasts all crouching low, their King adore, And dare not see what they contemn'd before: The trembling forrest quakes at his affrighting roar. 21 Mountains he flings in seas with mighty hand; Stops, and turns back the Sunnes impetuous course; Nature breaks natures laws at his command; No force of hell or heav'n withstands his force: Events to come yet many ages hence He present makes, by wondrous prescience; Proving the senses blinde, by being blinde to sense. 22 His sky-like arms, di'd all in blue and white, And set with golden starres that flamed wide; His shield invisible to mortall sight, Yet he upon it easily descri'd The lively semblance of his dying Lord; Whose bleeding side with wicked steel was gor'd, Which to his fainting spirits new courage would afford. 23 Strange was the force of that enchanted shield, Which highest powers to it from heav'n impart; For who could bear it well, and rightly wield, It sav'd from sword, and spear, and poison'd dart: Well might he slip, but yet not wholly fall: No finall losse his courage might appall; Growing more sound by wounds, and rising by his fall. 24 So some have feign'd that Tellus giant sonne Drew many new-born lives from his dead mother; Another rose as soon as one was done, And twentie lost, yet still remain'd another: For when he fell, and kist the barren heath, His parent straight inspir'd successive breath; And though her self was dead, yet ransom'd him from death. 25 With him his Nurse went, carefull Hearing. AcoÃ«; Whose hands first from his mothers wombe did take him, And ever since have foster'd tenderly: She never might, she never would forsake him; And he her lov'd again with mutuall band: For by her needfull help he oft did stand, When else he soon would fail, and fall in foemens hand. 26 With both sweet Meditation ever pac't, His Nurses daughter, and his Foster-sister: Deare as his soul he in his soul her plac't, And oft embrac't, and oft by stealth he kist her: For she had taught him by her silent talk To tread the safe, and dangerous wayes to balk; And brought his God with him, him with his God to walk. 27 Behinde him Penitence did sadly go, Whose cloudie dropping eyes were ever raining; Her swelling tears, which ev'n in ebbing flow, Furrow her cheek, the sinfull puddles draining: Much seem'd she in her pensive thought molested, And much the mocking world her soul infested; More she the hatefull world, and most her self detested. 28 She was the object of lewd mens disgrace, The squint-ey'd, wrie-mouth'd scoffe of carnall hearts; Yet smiling heav'n delights to kisse her face, And with his bloud God bathes her painfull smarts: Afflictions iron flail her soul had thrasht; Sharp Circumcisions knife her heart had slasht; Yet was it angels wine, which in her eyes was masht. 29 With her a troop of mournfull grooms abiding, Help with their sullen blacks their Mistresse wo; Amendment still (but still his own faults) chiding, And Penance arm'd with smarting whips did go: Then sad Remorse came sighing all the way; Last Satisfaction, giving all away: Much surely did he owe, much more he would repay. 30 Next went Hope. Elpinus, clad in skie-like blue; And through his arms few starres did seem to peep, Which there the workmans hand so finely drew, That rockt in clouds they softly seem'd to sleep: His rugged shield was like a rockie mold, On which an anchour bit with surest hold: I hold by being held, was written round in gold. 31 Nothing so cheerfull was his thoughtfull face, As was his brother Fido's: Fear seem'd dwell Close by his heart; his colour chang'd apace, And went, and came, that sure all was not well: Therefore a comely Maid did oft sustain His fainting steps, and fleeting life maintain: Promise. Pollicita she hight, which ne're could lie or feigne. 32 Next to Elpinus marcht his brother Love; Not that great Love which cloth'd his Godhead bright With rags of flesh, and now again above Hath drest his flesh in heav'ns eternall light; Much lesse the brat of that false Cyprian dame, Begot by froth, and fire in bed of shame, And now burns idle hearts swelt'ring in lustfull flame: 33 But this from heav'n brings his immortall race, And nurst by Gratitude; whose carefull arms Long held, and hold him still in kinde embrace: But train'd to daily warres, and fierce alarms, He grew to wondrous strength, and beautie rare: Next that God-Love, from whom his off-springs are, No match in earth or heav'n may with this Love compare. 34 His Page, who from his side might never move, Remembrance, on him waits; in books reciting The famous passions of that highest Love, His burning zeal to greater flames exciting: Deep would he sigh, and seem empassion'd sore, And oft with tears his backward heart deplore, That loving all he could, he lov'd that Love no more. 35 Yet sure he truely lov'd, and honour'd deare That glorious name; for when, or where he spi'd Wrong'd, or in hellish speech blasphem'd did heare, Boldly the rash blasphemer he defi'd, And forc't him eat the words he foully spake: But if for him he grief or death did take, That grief he counted joy, and death life for his sake. 36 His glitt'ring arms, drest all with firie hearts, Seem'd burn in chaste desire, and heav'nly flame: And on his shield kinde Jonathan imparts To his souls friend his robes, and princely name, And kingly throne, which mortals so adore: And round about was writ in golden ore, Well might he give him all, that gave his life before. 37 These led the Vantguard; and an hundred moe Fill'd up the emptie ranks with ord'red train: But first in middle ward did justly go In goodly arms a fresh and lovely Swain, Vaunting himself Loves twin, but younger brother: Well mought it be; for ev'n their very mother With pleasing errour oft mistook the one for th' other. 38 As when fair Paris gave that golden ball, A thousand doubts ranne in his stagg'ring breast: All lik'd him well, fain would he give it all; Each better seems, and still the last seems best: Doubts ever new his reaching hand deferr'd; The more he looks, the more his judgement err'd: So she first this, then that, then none, then both preferr'd. 39 Like them, their armour seem'd full neare of kinne: In this they onely differ; th' elder bent His higher soul to heav'n, the younger Twinne 'Mong mortals here his love and kindenesse spent; Teaching strange alchymie, to get a living By selling land, and to grow rich by giving; By emptying filling bags, so heav'n by earth atchieving. 40 About him troop the poore with num'rous trains, Whom he with tender care, and large expence, With kindest words, and succour entertains; Ne looks for thanks, or thinks of recompence: His wardrobe serves to cloath the naked side, And shamefull parts of bared bodies hide; If other cloaths he lackt, his own he would divide. 41 To rogues his gate was shut; but open lay, Kindely the weary traveller inviting: Oft therefore Angels, hid in mortall clay, And God himself in his free roofs delighting, Lowly to visit him would not disdain, And in his narrow cabin oft remain, Whom heav'n, &amp; earth, &amp; all the world cannot contain. 42 His table still was fill'd with wholesome meat, Not to provoke, but quiet appetite; And round about the hungry freely eat, With plenteous cates cheering their feeble sprite: Their earnest vows broke open heav'ns wide doore, That not in vain sweet Plentie evermore With gracious eye looks down upon his blessed store. 43 Behinde attend him in an uncouth wise A troop with little caps, and shaved head; Such whilome was infranched bondmens guise, New freed from cruell masters servile dread: These had he lately bought from captive chain; Hence they his triumph sing with joyfull strain, And on his head due praise and thousand blessings rain. 44 He was a father to the fatherlesse, To widows he suppli'd an husbands care; Nor would he heap up woe to their distresse, Or by a Guardians name their state impair; But rescue them from strong oppressours might: Nor doth he weigh the great mans heavie spight. Who fears the highest Judge, needs fear no mortall wight. 45 Once every week he on his progresse went, The sick to visit, and those meager swains, Which all their weary life in darknesse spent, Clogg'd with cold iron, prest with heavy chains: He hoords not wealth for his loose heir to spend it, But with a willing hand doth well expend it. Good then is onely good, when to our God we lend it. 46 And when the dead by cruell tyrants spight Lie out to rav'nous birds and beasts expos'd, His yearnfull heart pitying that wretched sight, In seemly graves their weary flesh enclos'd, And strew'd with dainty flowers the lowly herse; Then all alone the last words did rehearse, Bidding them softly sleep in his sad sighing verse. 47 So once that royall Antigone, daughter of Oedipus, contrary to the edict of Creon, buries Polynices.Maid fierce Thebes beguil'd, Though wilfull Creon proudly did forbid her; Her brother, from his home and tombe exil'd, (While willing night in darknesse safely hid her) She lowly laid in earths all-covering shade: Her dainty hands (not us'd to such a trade) She with a mattock toils, and with a weary spade. 48 Yet feels she neither sweat, nor irksome pain, Till now his grave was fully finished; Then on his wounds her cloudy eyes 'gin rain, To wash the guilt painted in bloudy red: And falling down upon his gored side, With hundred varied plaints she often cri'd, Oh had I di'd for thee, or with thee might have di'd! 49 Ay me! my ever wrong'd, and banisht brother, How can I fitly thy hard fate deplore, Or in my breast so just complainings smother? To thy sad chance what can be added more? Exile thy home, thy home a tombe thee gave: Oh no; such little room thou must not have, But for thy banisht bones I (wretch) must steal a grave. 50 But whither, wofull Maid, have thy complaints With fellow passion drawn my feeling mone? But thus this Love deals with those murd'red Saints; Weeps with the sad, and sighs with those that grone. But now in that beech grove we'l safely play, And in those shadows mock the boyling ray; Which yet increases more with the decreasing day. CANT. X. The Shepherds to the woodie mount withdrew, Where th' hillock seats, shades yeeld a canopie; Whose tops with violets di'd all in blue Might seem to make a little azure skie: And that round hill, which their weak heads maintain'd, A lesser Atlas seem'd, whose neck sustain'd The weight of all the heav'ns, which sore his shoulders pain'd. 2 And here and there sweet Primrose scattered, Spangling the blue, fit constellations make: Some broadly flaming their fair colours spread; Some other winkt, as yet but half awake: Fit were they plac't, and set in order due: Nature seem'd work by art, so lively true A little heav'n on earth in narrow space she drew. 3 Upon this earthly heav'n the shepherds play, The time beguiling, and the parching light; Till the declining Sunne, and elder day Abate their flaming heat, and youthfull might: The sheep had left the shades, to minde their meat; Then all returning to their former seat, Thirsil again began his wearie song repeat. 4 Great power of Love! with what commanding fire Dost thou enflame the worlds wide Regiment, And kindely heat in every heart inspire! Nothing is free from thy sweet government: Fish burn in seas; beasts, birds thy weapons prove; By thee dead elements and heavens move, Which void of sense it self, yet are not void of love. 5 But those twinne Loves, which from thy seas of light To us on earth derive their lesser streams, Though in their force they shew thy wondrous might, On thee reflecting back their glorious beams, Yet here encountred with so mightie foe, Had need both arm'd and surely guarded go: But most thy help they need; do not thy help foreslow. 6 Next to the younger Love Peaceablenesse. Irenus went, Whose frostie head proclaim'd his winter age: His spring in many battels had he spent, But now all weapons chang'd for counsell sage. His heavie sword (the witnesse of his might) Upon a lopped tree he idlely pight; There hid in quiet sheath, sleeps it in endlesse night. 7 Patience his shield had lent to ward his breast, Whose golden plain three Olive-branches dresse: The word in letters large was fair exprest, Thrice happy authour of a happie peace. Rich plenty yeelds him power, power stores his will; Will ends in works, good works his treasures fill: Earths slave, Matth. 5. 9.heav'ns heir he is; as God, payes good for ill. 8 By him Fortitude. Andreos pac't, of middle age, His minde as farre from rashnesse, as from fears; Hating base thoughts as much as desperate rage: The worlds loud thund'rings he unshaken heares; Nor will he death or life or seek or flie, Readie for both. He is as cowardly That longer fears to live, as he that fears to die. 9 Worst was his civil warre, where deadly fought He with himself, till Passion yeelds, or dies: All heart and hand, no tongue; not grimme, but stout: His flame had counsell in't, his furie eyes; His rage well temper'd is: no fear can dant His reason; but cold bloud is valiant: Well may he strength in death, but never courage want. 10 But like a mighty rock, whose unmov'd sides The hostile sea assaults with furious wave, And 'gainst his head the boist'rous North-winde rides; Both fight, and storm, and swell, and roar, and rave; Hoarse surges drum, loud blasts their trumpets strain: Th' heroick cliffe laughs at their frustrate pain: Waves scatter'd drop in tears, windes broken whining plain: 11 Such was this Knights undanted constancie; No mischief weakens his resolved minde: None fiercer to a stubborn enemie, But to the yeelding none more sweetly kinde. His shield an even-ballast ship embraves, Which dances light, while Neptune wildely raves: His word was this, I fear but heav'n, nor windes, nor waves. 12 And next, Longsuffering. Macrothumus, whose quiet face No cloud of passion ever shadowed; Nor could hot anger Reasons rule displace, Purpling the scarlet cheek with firie red: Nor could revenge, clad in a deadly white, With hidden malice eat his vexed sprite: For ill he good repay'd, and love exchang'd for spite. 13 Was never yet a more undanted spirit; Yet most him deem'd a base and tim'rous swain: But he well weighing his own strength and merit, The greatest wrong could wisely entertain. Nothing resisted his commanding spear: Yeelding it self to him a winning were; And though he di'd, yet dead he rose a conquerer. 14 His naturall force beyond all nature stretched: Most strong he is, because he will be weak; And happie most, because he can be wretched. Then whole and sound, when he himself doth break; Rejoycing most when most he is tormented: In greatest discontents he rests contented: By conquering himself all conquests he prevented. 15 His rockie arms of massie adamant Safely could back rebutt the hardest blade: His skinne it self could any weapon dant, Of such strange mold and temper was he made: Upon his shield a Palm-tree still increased, Though many weights his rising arms depressed: His word was, Rising most, by being most oppressed. 16 Next him Gentlenesse, or courtesie. Androphilus, whose sweetest minde 'Twixt mildenesse temper'd, and low courtesie, Could leave as soon to be, as not be kinde: Churlish despite ne're lookt from his calm eye, Much lesse commanded in his gentle heart: To baser men fair looks he would impart; Nor could he cloak ill thoughts in complementall art. 17 His enemies knew not how to discommend him, All others dearely lov'd; fell ranc'rous Spite, And vile Detraction fain would reprehend him; And oft in vain his name they closely bite, As popular, and flatterer accusing: But he such slavish office much refusing, Can eas'ly quit his name from their false tongues abusing. 18 His arms were fram'd into a glitt'ring night, Whose sable gown with starres all spangled wide Affords the weary traveller cheerfull light, And to his home his erring footsteps guide: Upon his ancient shield the workman fine Had drawn the Sunne, whose eye did ne're repine To look on good, and ill: his word, To all I shine. 19 Fair Vertue, where stay'st thou in poore exile, Leaving the Court from whence thou took'st thy name? While in thy place is stept Disdaining vile, And Flatterie, base sonne of Need and Shame; And with them surly Scorn, and hatefull Pride; Whose artificiall face false colours di'd, Which more display her shame, then loathsome foulnesse hide. 20 Late there thou livedst with a gentle Swain, (As gentle Swain as ever lived there) Who lodg'd thee in his heart, and all thy train, Where hundred other Graces quarter'd were: But he (alas!) untimely dead and gone, Leaves us to rue his death, and thee to mone, That few were ever such, &amp; now those few are none. 21 By him the stout Temperance. Encrates boldly went, Assailed oft by mightie enemies, Which all on him alone their spite misspent; For he whole armies single bold defies: With him nor might, nor cunning slights prevail; All force on him they trie, all forces fail: Yet still assail him fresh, yet vainly still assail. 22 His body full of vigour, full of health; His table feeds not lust, but strength, and need: Full stor'd with plenty, not by heaping wealth, But topping rank desires, which vain exceed: On's shield an hand from heav'n an orchyard dressing, Pruning superfluous boughs the trees oppressing, So adding fruit: his word, By lessening increasing. 23 His setled minde was written in his face: For on his forehead cheerfull gravitie False joyes and apish vanities doth chase; And watchfull care did wake in either eye: His heritance he would not lavish sell, Nor yet his treasure hide by neighbouring hell: But well he ever spent, what he had gotten well. 24 A lovely pair of twins clos'd either side: Not those in heav'n, the flowrie Geminies, Are half so lovely bright; the one his Bride, Chastitie in the married. Agnia chaste, was joyn'd in Hymens ties, And love, as pure as heav'ns conjunction: Thus she was his, and he her flesh and bone: So were they two in sight, in truth entirely one. 25 Upon her arched brow unarmed Love Triumphing sat in peacefull victorie; And in her eyes thousand chaste Graces move, Checking vain thoughts with awfull majestie: Ten thousand moe her fairer breast contains; Where quiet meeknesse every ill restrains, And humbly subject spirit by willing service reignes. 26 Her skie-like arms glitter'd in golden beams, And brightly seem'd to flame with burning hearts: The scalding ray with his reflected streams Fire to their flames, but heav'nly fire, imparts: Upon her shield a pair of Turtles shone; A loving pair, still coupled, ne're alone: Her word, Though one when two, yet either two, or none. 27 With her, her sister went, a warlike Maid, Chastitie in the single. Parthenia, all in steel, and gilded arms; In needles stead a mighty spear she swayd, With which in bloudy fields and fierce alarms The boldest champion she down would bear, And like a thunderbolt wide passage tear, Flinging all to the earth with her enchanted spear. 28 Her goodly armour seem'd a garden green, Where thousand spotlesse lilies freshly blew; And on her shield the 'lone bird might be seen, Th' Arabian bird, shining in colours new: It self unto it self was onely mate; Ever the same, but new in newer date: And underneath was writ, Such is chaste single state. 29 Thus hid in arms, she seem'd a goodly Knight, And fit for any warlike exercise: But when she list lay down her armour bright, And back resume her peacefull Maidens guise; The fairest Maid she was, that ever yet Prison'd her locks within a golden net, Or let them waving hang, with roses fair beset. 30 Choice Nymph, the crown of chaste Diana's train, Thou beauties lilie, set in heav'nly earth; Thy fairs unpattern'd all perfections stain: Sure heav'n with curious pencil, at thy birth, In thy rare face her own full picture drew: It is a strong verse here to write but true: Hyperboles in others are but half thy due. 31 Upon her forehead Love his trophies fits, A thousand spoils in silver arch displaying; And in the midst himself full proudly sits, Himself in awfull majestie araying: Upon her brows lies his bent Ebon bow, And ready shafts: deadly those weapons show; Yet sweet that death appear'd, lovely that deadly blow. 32 And at the foot of this celestiall frame Two radiant starres, then starres yet better being, Endu'd with living fire, and seeing flame; Yet with heav'ns starres in this too neare agreeing; They timely warmth, themselves not warm, inspire; These kindle thousand hearts with hot desire, And burning all they see, feel in themselves no fire. 33 Ye matchlesse starres, (yet each the others match) Heav'ns richest diamonds, set on Ammel white, From whose bright spheres all grace the Graces catch, And will not move but by your load-starres bright; How have you stoln, and stor'd your armourie With Loves and deaths strong shafts, and from your skie Poure down thick showers of darts to force whole armies flie? 34 Above those Sunnes two Rainbows high aspire, Not in light shews, but sadder liveries drest; Fair Iris seem'd to mourn in sable tire; Yet thus more sweet the greedie eye they feast: And but that wondrous face it well allow'd, Wondrous it seem'd, that two fair Rainbows show'd Above their sparkling Sunnes, without or rain, or cloud. 35 A bed of lilies flower upon her cheek, And in the midst was set a circling rose; Whose sweet aspect would force Narcissus seek New liveries, and fresher colours choose To deck his beauteous head in snowie tire; But all in vain: for who can hope t' aspire To such a fair, which none attain, but all admire? 36 Her rubie lips lock up from gazing sight A troop of pearls, which march in goodly row: But when she deignes those precious bones undight, Soon heav'nly notes from those divisions flow, And with rare musick charm the ravisht eares, Danting bold thoughts, but cheering modest fears: The spheres so onely sing, so onely charm the spheres. 37 Her daintie breasts, like to an April rose From green-silk fillets yet not all unbound, Began their little rising heads disclose, And fairly spread their silver circlets round: From those two bulwarks Love doth safely fight; Which swelling easily, may seem to sight To be enwombed both of pleasure and delight. 38 Yet all these Starres which deck this beauteous skie, By force of th' inward Sunne both shine and move: Thron'd in her heart sits Loves high majestie; In highest majestie the highest Love. As when a taper shines in glassie frame, The sparkling crystall burns in glitt'ring flame: So does that brightest Love brighten this lovely dame. 39 Thus, and much fairer, fair Parthenia Glist'ring in arms, her self presents to sight; As when th' Amazon Queen, Hippolyta, With Theseus entred lists in single fight, With equall arms her mighty foe opposing; Till now her bared head her face disclosing, Conquer'd the conquerour, &amp; wan the fight by losing. 40 A thousand Knights woo'd her with busie pain, To thousand she her virgin grant deni'd; Although her deare-sought love to entertain They all their wit and all their strength appli'd: Yet in her heart Love close his scepter swayd, That to an heav'nly spouse her thoughts betraid, Where she a maiden wife might live, and wifely maid. 41 Upon her steps a virgin Page attended, Fair Modestie. Erythre, whose often-blushing face Sweetly her in-born shame-fac't thoughts commended; The faces change prov'd th' hearts unchanged grace, Which she a shrine to puritie devotes: So when cleare ivorie vermeil fitly blots, By stains it fairer grows, and lovelier by its spots. 42 Her golden hair, her silver forehead high, Her teeth of solid, eyes of liquid pearl; But neck and breast no man might bare descrie, So sweetly modest was this bashfull girle: But that sweet paradise (ah!) could we see, On these white mountlets daintier apples be, Then those we bought so deare on Edens tempting tree. 43 These noble Knights this threatned fort defend; These, and a thousand moe heroick Swains, That to this 'stressed State their service lend, To free from force, and save from captive chains. But now too late the battell to recite; For Hesperus heav'ns tapers 'gins to light, And warns each starre to wait upon their Mistres Night. CANT. XI. 1 The early Morn lets out the peeping day, And strew'd his paths with golden Marygolds: The Moon grows wanne, and starres flie all away, Whom Lucifer locks up in wonted folds, Till light is quencht, and heav'n in seas hath flung The headlong day: to th' hill the shepherds throng, And Thirsil now began to end his task and song. 2 Who now (alas!) shall teach my humble vein, That never yet durst peep from covert glade; But softly learnt for fear to sigh and plain, And vent her griefs to silent myrtils shade? Who now shall teach to change my oaten quill For trumpet 'larms, or humble verses fill With gracefull majestie, and loftie rising skill? 3 Ah thou dread Spirit, shed thy holy fire, Thy holy flame into my frozen heart; Teach thou my creeping measures to aspire, And swell in bigger notes, and higher art: Teach my low Muse thy fierce alarums ring, And raise my soft strain to high thundering: Tune thou my loftie song; thy battels must I sing. 4 Such as thou wert within the sacred breast Of that thrice famous Poet-Shepherd-King; And taught'st his heart to frame his Canto's best Of all that e're thy glorious works did sing: Or as those holy Fishers once amongs Thou flamedst bright with sparkling parted tongues, And brought'st down heav'n to earth in those all-conqu'ring songs. 5 These mighty Heroes, fill'd with justest rage To be in narrow walls so closely pent, Glitt'ring in arms, and goodly equipage, Stood at the Castles gate, now ready bent To sally out, and meet the enemie: A hot disdain sparkled in every eye, Breathing out hatefull warre, and deadly enmitie. 6 Thither repairs the carefull Intellect, With his fair Spouse Voletta, heav'nly fair: With both, their daughter; whose divine aspect, Though now sad damps of sorrow much empair, Yet through those clouds did shine so glorious bright, That every eye did homage to the sight, Yeelding their captive hearts to that commanding light. 7 But who may hope to paint such majestie, Or shadow well such beautie, such a face, Such beauteous face, unseen to mortall eye? Whose powerfull looks, and more then mortall grace Loves self hath lov'd, leaving his heav'nly throne, With amorous sighs, and many a lovely mone (Whom all the world would wooe) woo'd her his onely one. 8 Farre be that boldnesse from thy humble swain, Fairest Ec[l]ecta, to describe thy beautie, And with unable skill thy glory stain, Which ever he admires with humble dutie: But who to view such blaze of beautie longs, Go he to Sinah, th' holy groves amongs; Where that wise Shepherd chants her in his Song of songs. 9 The Islands King with sober countenance Aggrates the Knights, who thus his right defended; And with grave speech, and comely amenance Himself, his State, his Spouse, to them commended: His lovely childe, that by him pensive stands, He last delivers to their valiant hands; And her to thank the Knights, her Champions, he commands. 10 The God-like Maid a while all silent stood, And down to th' earth let fall her humble eyes; While modest thoughts shot up the flaming bloud, Which fir'd her scarlet cheek with rosie dies: But soon to quench the heat, that lordly reignes, From her fair eye a shower of crystall rains, Which with his silver streams o're-runs the beauteous plains. 11 As when the Sunne in midst of summers heat Draws up thinne vapours with his potent ray, Forcing dull waters from their native seat; At length dimme clouds shadow the burning day: Till coldest aire, soon melted into showers, Upon the earth his welcome anger powres, And heav'ns cleare forehead now wipes off her former lowres. 12 At length a little lifting up her eyes, A renting sigh way for her sorrow brake, Which from her heart 'gan in her face to rise, And first in th' eye, then in the lip thus spake; Ah gentle Knights, how may a simple maid, With justest grief and wrong so ill apaid, Give due reward for such your pains, and friendly aid? 13 But if my Princely Spouse do not delay His timely presence in my greatest need, He will for me your friendly love repay, And well requite this your so gentle deed: Then let no fear your mighty hearts assail: His word's himself; himself he cannot fail. Long may he stay, yet sure he comes, and must prevail. 14 By this the long-shut gate was open laid; Soon out they rush in order well arang'd: And fastning in their eyes that heav'nly Maid, How oft for fear her fairest colour chang'd! Her looks, her worth, her goodly grace, and state Comparing with her present wretched fate, Pitie whets just revenge, and loves fire kindles hate. 15 Long at the gate the thoughtfull Intellect Staid with his fearfull Queen, and daughter fair; But when the Knights were past their dimme aspect, They follow them with vowes, and many a prayer: At last they climbe up to the Castles height; From which they view'd the deeds of every Knight, And markt the doubtfull end of this intestine fight. 16 As when a youth, bound for the Belgick warre, Takes leave of friends upon the Kentish shore; Now are they parted, and he sail'd so farre, They see not now, and now are seen no more: Yet farre off viewing the white trembling sails, The tender mother soon plucks off her veils, And shaking them aloft, unto her sonne she hails. 17 Mean time these Champions march in fit aray, Till both the armies now were come in sight: A while each other boldly viewing stay, With short delayes whetting fierce rage and spight. Sound now ye trumpets, sound alarums loud; Heark how their clamours whet their anger proud: See, yonder are they met in midst of dustie cloud. 18 So oft the South with civil enmitie Musters his watrie forces 'gainst the West; The rowling clouds come tumbling up the skie, In dark folds wrapping up their angry guest: At length the flame breaks from th' imprisoning cold, With horrid noise tearing the limber mold; While down in liquid tears the broken vapours roll'd. 19 First did that warlike Maid her self advance; And riding from amidst her companie, About her helmet wav'd her mighty lance, Daring to fight the proudest enemie: Porneios soon his ready spear addrest, And kicking with his heel his hastie beast, Bent his sharp-headed lance against her dainty breast. 20 In vain the broken staffe sought entrance there, Where Love himself oft entrance sought in vain: But much unlike the Martial Virgins spear, Which low dismounts her foe on dustie plain, Broaching with bloudy point his breast before: Down from the wound trickled the bubbling gore, And bid pale death come in at that red gaping doore. 21 There lies he cover'd now in lowly dust, And foully wallowing in clutter'd bloud, Breathing together out his life and lust, Which from his breast swamme in the steaming floud: In maids his joy; now by a maid defi'd, His life he lost, and all his former pride: With women would he live, now by a woman di'd. 22 Aselges, struck with such a heavie sight, Greedie to venge his brothers sad decay, Spurr'd forth his flying steed with fell despight, And met the virgin in the middle way: His spear against her head he fiercely threw, Which to that face performing homage due, Kissing her helmet, thence in thousand shivers flew. 23 The wanton boy had dreamt that latest night, That he had learnt the liquid aire dispart, And swimme along the heav'ns with pineons light; Now that fair maid taught him this nimble art: For from his saddle farre away she sent, Flying along the emptie element; That hardly yet he knew whither his course was bent. 24 The rest that saw with fear the ill successe Of single fight, durst not like fortune trie; But round beset her with their numerous presse: Before, beside, behinde they on her flie, And every part with coward odds assail: But she redoubling strokes as thick as hail, Drove farre their flying troops, &amp; thresht with iron flail. 25 As when a gentle greyhound set around With little curres, which dare his way molest, Snapping behinde; soon as the angrie hound Turning his course, hath caught the busiest, And shaking in his fangs hath welnigh slain; The rest fear'd with his crying, runne amain; And standing all aloof whine, houl, and bark in vain. 26 The subtil Dragon, that from farre did view The waste and spoil made by this maiden Knight, Fell to his wonted guile; for well he knew All force was vain against such wondrous might: A craftie swain well taught to cunning harms, Call'd false Delight, he chang'd with hellish charms; That true Delight he seem'd, the self-same shape and arms. 27 The watchfull'st sight no difference could descrie; The same his face, his voice, his gate the same: Thereto his words he feign'd; and coming nigh The Maid, that fierce pursues her martiall game, He whets her wrath with many a guilefull word, Till she lesse carefull did fit time afford: Then up with both his hands he lifts his balefull sword. 28 You powerfull heav'ns! and thou their Governour! With what eyes can you view this dolefull sight? How can you see your fairest Conquerour So nigh her end by so unmanly slight? The dreadfull weapon through the aire doth glide; But sure you turn'd the harmfull edge aside: Else must she there have fall'n, and by that traitour di'd. 29 Yet in her side deep was the wound impight; Her flowing life the shining armour stains: From that wide spring long rivers took their flight, With purple streams drowning the silver plains: Her cheerfull colour now grows wanne and pale, Which oft she strives with courage to recall, And rouze her fainting head, which down as oft would fall. 30 All so a Lilie, prest with heavie rain, Which fills her cup with showers up to the brinks; The wearie stalk no longer can sustain The head, but low beneath the burden sinks: Or as a virgin Rose her leaves displayes, Whom too hot scorching beams quite disarayes; Down flags her double ruffe, and all her sweet decayes. 31 Th' undanted Maid, feeling her feet denie Their wonted dutie, to a tree retir'd; Whom all the rout pursue with deadly crie: As when a hunted Stag, now welnigh tir'd, Shor'd by an oak, 'gins with his head to play; The fearfull hounds dare not his horns assay, But running round about, with yelping voices bay. 32 And now perceiving all her strength was spent, Lifting to listning heav'n her trembling eyes, Thus whispring soft, her soul to heav'n she sent; Thou chastest Love, that rul'st the wandring skies, More pure then purest heavens by thee moved; If thine own love in me thou sure hast proved; If ever thou my self, my vows, my love hast loved. 33 Let not this Temple of thy spotlesse love Be with foul hand and beastly rage defil'd: But when my spirit shall his camp remove, And to his home return, too long exil'd; Do thou protect it from the ravenous spoil Of ranc'rous enemies, that hourely toil Thy humble votarie with loathsome spot to foil. 34 With this few drops fell from her fainting eyes, To dew the fading roses of her cheek; That much high Love seem'd passion'd with those cries; Much more those streams his heart and patience break: Straight he the charge gives to a winged Swain, Quickly to step down to that bloudie plain, And aid her wearie arms, and rightfull cause maintain. 35 Soon stoops the speedie Herauld through the aire, Where chaste Agneia and Encrates fought: See, see, he cries, where your Parthenia fair, The flower of all your armie, hemm'd about With thousand enemies, now fainting stands, Readie to fall into their murdring hands: Hie ye, oh hie ye fast; the highest Love commands. 36 They casting round about their angrie eye, The wounded Virgin almost sinking spi'd: They prick their steeds, which straight like lightning flie: Their brother Continence runnes by their side; Fair Continence, that truely long before As his hearts liege, this Ladie did adore: And now his faithfull love kindled his hate the more. 37 Encrates and his Spouse with flashing sword Assail the scatter'd troops, that headlong flie; While Continence a precious liquor pour'd Into the wound, and suppled tenderly: Then binding up the gaping orifice, Reviv'd the spirits, that now she 'gan to rise, And with new life confront her heartlesse enemies. 38 So have I often seen a purple flower Fainting through heat, hang down her drooping head; But soon refreshed with a welcome shower, Begins again her lively beauties spread, And with new pride her silken leaves display; And with the Sunne doth now more gently play, Lay out her swelling bosome to the smiling day. 39 Now rush they all into the flying trains; Bloud fires their bloud, and slaughter kindles fight: The wretched vulgar on the purple plains Fall down as thick, as when a rustick wight From laden oaks the plenteous akorns poures, Or when the blubbring ayer sadly lowres, And melts his sullen brow, and weeps sweet April showers. 40 The greedy Dragon, that aloof did spie So ill successe of this renewed fray; More vext with losse of certain victorie, Depriv'd of so assur'd and wished prey, Gnashed his iron teeth for grief and spite: The burning sparks leap from his flaming sight, And forth his smoking jawes steams out a smouldring night. 41 Straight thither sends he in a fresh supply, The swelling band that drunken Methos led, And all the rout his brother Gluttonie Commands, in lawlesse bands disordered: So now they bold restore their broken fight, And fiercely turn again from shamefull flight; While both with former losse sharpen their raging spite. 42 Freshly these Knights assault these fresher bands, And with new battell all their strength renew: Down fell Geloios by Encrates hands, Agneia MÅchus and Anagnus slew; And spying Methos fenc't in's iron vine, Pierc't his swoln panch: there lies the grunting swine, And spues his liquid soul out in his purple wine. 43 As when a greedy lion, long unfed, Breaks in at length into the harmlesse folds; (So hungry rage commands) with fearfull dread He drags the silly beasts: nothing controlls The victour proud; he spoils, devours, and tears: In vain the keeper calls his shepherd peers: Mean while the simple flock gaze on with silent fears: 44 Such was the slaughter these three Champions made; But most Encrates, whose unconquer'd hands Sent thousand foes down to th' infernall shade, With uselesse limbes strewing the bloudie sands: Oft were they succourd fresh with new supplies, But fell as oft: the Dragon grown more wise By former losse, began another way devise. 45 Soon to their aid the Cyprian band he sent, For easie skirmish clad in armour light: Their golden bowes in hand stood ready bent, And painted quivers (furnisht well for fight) Stuck full of shafts, whose head foul poyson stains; Which dipt in Phlegethon by hellish swains, Bring thousand painfull deaths, and thousand deadly pains. 46 Thereto of substance strange, so thinne, and slight, And wrought by subtil hand so cunningly, That hardly were discern'd by weaker sight; Sooner the heart did feel, then eye could see: Farre off they stood, and flung their darts around, Raining whole clouds of arrows on the ground; So safely others hurt, and never wounded wound. 47 Much were the Knights encumbred with these foes; For well they saw, and felt their enemies: But when they back would turn the borrow'd blows, The light-foot troop away more swiftly flies, Then do their winged arrows through the winde: And in their course oft would they turn behinde, And with their glancing darts their hot pursuers blinde. 48 As when by Russian Volgha's frozen banks The false-back Tartars fear with cunning feigne, And poasting fast away in flying ranks, Oft backward turn, and from their bowes down rain Whole storms of darts; so do they flying fight: And what by force they lose, they winne by slight; Conquerd by standing out, and conquerours by flight: 49 Such was the craft of this false Cyprian crue: Yet oft they seem'd to slack their fearfull pace, And yeeld themselves to foes that fast pursue; So would they deeper wound in nearer space: In such a fight he winnes, that fastest flies. Flie, flie, chaste Knights, such subtil enemies: The vanquisht cannot live, and conqu'rour surely dies. 50 The Knights opprest with wounds and travel past, Began retire, and now were neare to fainting: With that a winged Poast him speeded fast, The Generall with these heavy newes acquainting: He soon refresht their hearts that 'gan to tire. But let out weary Muse a while respire: Shade we our scorched heads from PhÅbus parching fire. CANT. XII. 1 The shepherds guarded from the sparkling heat Of blazing aire, upon the flowrie banks, (Where various flowers damask the fragrant seat, And all the grove perfume) in wonted ranks Securely sit them down, and sweetly play: At length thus Thirsil ends his broken lay, Lest that the stealing night his later song might stay. 2 Thrice, oh thrice happie shepherds life and state, When Courts are happinesse unhappie pawns! His cottage low, and safely humble gate Shuts out proud fortune, with her scorns, and fawns: No feared treason breaks his quiet sleep: Singing all day, his flocks he learns to keep; Himself as innocent as are his simple sheep. 3 No Serian worms he knows, that with their threed Draw out their silken lives; nor silken pride: His lambes warm fleece well fits his little need, Not in that proud Sidonian tincture di'd: No emptie hopes, no courtly fears him fright; No begging wants his middle fortune bite: But sweet content exiles both miserie and spite. 4 In stead of musick and base flattering tongues, Which wait to first-salute my Lords uprise; The cheerfull lark wakes him with early songs, And birds sweet whistling notes unlock his eyes: In countrey playes is all the strife he uses, Or sing, or dance unto the rurall Muses; And but in musicks sports, all difference refuses. 5 His certain life, that never can deceive him, Is full of thousand sweets, and rich content: The smooth-leav'd beeches in the field receive him With coolest shades, till noon-tides rage is spent: His life is neither tost in boist'rous seas Of troublous world, nor lost in slothfull ease: Pleas'd &amp; full blest he lives, when he his God can please. 6 His bed of wool yeelds safe and quiet sleeps, While by his side his faithfull spouse hath place: His little sonne into his bosome creeps, The lively picture of his fathers face: Never his humble house or state torment him; Lesse he could like, if lesse his God had sent him: And when he dies, green turfs with grassie tombe content him. 7 The worlds great Light his lowly state hath blest, And left his heav'n to be a shepherd base: Thousand sweet songs he to his pipe addrest: Swift rivers stood; beasts, trees, stones ranne apace, And serpents flew to heare his softest strains: He fed his flock, where rolling Jordan reignes; There took our rags, gave us his robes, and bore our pains. 8 Then thou high Light, whom shepherds low adore, Teach me, oh do thou teach thy humble swain To raise my creeping song from earthly floor: Fill thou my empty breast with loftie strain; That singing of thy warres and dreadfull fight, My notes may thunder out thy conqu'ring might, And 'twixt the golden starres cut out her towring flight. 9 The mightie Generall moved with the news Of those foure famous Knights so neare decay, With hastie speed the conquering foe pursues; At last he spies where they were led away, Forc't to obey the Victours proud commands: Soon did he rush into the middle bands, And cut the slavish cords from their captived hands. 10 And for the Knights were faint, he quickly sent To Penitence, whom PhÅbus taught his art; Which she had eakt with long experiment: For many a soul, and many a wounded heart Had she restor'd, and brought to life again The broken spirit, with grief and horrour slain; That oft reviv'd, yet di'd as oft with smarting pain. 11 For she in severall baths their wounds did steep; The first of Rue which purg'd the foul infection, And cur'd the deepest wound, by wounding deep: Then would she make another strange confection, And mix it with Nepenthe soveraigne; Wherewith she quickly swag'd the rankling pain: Thus she the Knights recur'd, and washt from sinfull stain. 12 Mean time the fight now fiercer grows then ever: (For all his troops the Dragon hither drew) The two Twin-Loves, whom no place mought dissever, And Knowledge with his train begins anew To strike fresh summons up, and hot alarms: In midst great Fido, clad in sunne-like arms, With his unmatched force repairs all former harms. 13 So when the Sunne shines in bright Taurus head, Returning tempests all with winter fill; And still successive storms fresh mustered The timely yeare in his first springings kill: And oft it breathes a while, then straight again Doubly powres out his spite in smoking rain: The countreys vows &amp; hopes swimme on the drowned plain. 14 The lovely Twinnes ride 'gainst the Cyprian bands, Chasing their troops now with no feigned flight: Their broken shafts lie scatter'd on the sands, Themselves for fear quite vanisht out of sight: Against these conquerours Hypocrisie, And Cosm[os'] hated bands, with Ecthros slie, And all that rout do march, &amp; bold the Twinnes defie. 15 Elpinus mightie enemies assail; But Doubt of all the other most infested; That oft his fainting courage 'gan to fail, More by his craft then ods of force molested: For oft the treachour chang'd his weapon light, And sudden alter'd his first kinde of fight, And oft himself and shape transform'd with cunning slight. 16 So that great river, with Alcides striving In Oeneus court for the Ãtolian Maid, To divers shapes his fluent limbes contriving, From manly form in serpents frame he staid, Sweeping with speckled breast the dustie land; Then like a bull with horns did armed stand: His hanging dewlap trail'd along the golden sand. 17 Such shapes and changing fashions much dismaid him, That oft he stagger'd with unwonted fright; And but his brother Fido oft did aid him, There had he fell in unacquainted fight: But he would still his wavering strength maintain, And chase that Monster through the sandie plain; Which from him fled apace, but oft return'd again. 18 Yet him more strong and cunning foes withstand, Whom he with greater skill and strength defi'd: Foul Ignorance, with all her owl-ey'd band; Oft-starting Fear, Distrust ne're satisfi'd, And fond Suspect, and thousand other foes; Whom farre he drives with his unequall blows, And with his flaming sword their fainting armie mows. 19 As when bloud-guilty earth for vengeance cries, (If greatest things with lesse we may compare) The mighty Thunderer through the ayer flies, While snatching whirlwinds open waies prepare: Dark clouds spread out their sable curtains o're him; And Angels on their flaming wings up bore him: Mean time the guilty heav'ns for fear flie fast before him. 20 There while he on the windes proud pineons rides, Down with his fire some lofty mount he throwes, And fills the low vale with his ruin'd sides; Or on some church his three-forkt dart bestowes; (Which yet his sacred worship foul mistakes) Down falls the spire, the body fearfull quakes; Nor sure to fall, or stand, with doubtfull trembling shakes. 21 With Fido Knowledge went, who order'd right His mighty hands: so now his scatter'd troops Make head again, filling their broken fight; While with new change the Dragons armie droops, And from the following victours headlong runne: Yet still the Dragon frustrates what is done; And eas'ly makes them lose what they so hardly wonne. 22 Out of his gorge a hellish smoke he drew, That all the field with foggie mist enwraps; As when TiphÅus from his panch doth spew Black smothering flames, roll'd in loud thunder-claps: The pitchie vapours choke the shining ray, And bring dull night upon the smiling day; The wavering Ãtna shakes, and fain would runne away. 23 Yet could his bat-ey'd legions eas'ly see In this dark Chaos; they the seed of night: But these not so, who night and darknesse flee; For they the sonnes of day, and joy in light: But Knowledge soon began a way devise, To bring again the day, and cleare their eyes: So open'd Fido's shield, and golden veil unties. 24 Of one pure diamond, celestiall fair, That heav'nly shield by cunning hand was made; Whose light divine, spred through the mistie aire, To brightest morn would turn the Western shade, And lightsome day beget before his time; Framed in heav'n without all earthly crime; Dipt in the firy Sunne, which burnt the baser slime. 25 As when from fennie moors the lumpish clouds With rising steams damp the bright mornings face; At length the piercing Sunne his team unshrouds, And with his arrows th' idle fogge doth chase: The broken mist lies melted all in tears: So this bright shield the stinking darknesse teares, And giving back the day, dissolves their former fears. 26 Which when afarre the firie Dragon spies, His slights deluded with so little pain; To his last refuge now at length he flies: Long time his pois'nous gorge he seem'd to strain; At length with loathly sight he up doth spue From stinking panch a most deformed crue, That heav'n it self did flie from their most ugly view. 27 The first that crept from his detested maw, Was Sinne. Hamartia, foul deformed wight; More foul, deform'd, the Sunne yet never saw; Therefore she hates the all-betraying light: A woman seem'd she in her upper part; To which she could such lying glosse impart, That thousands she had slain with her deceiving art. 28 The rest (though hid) in serpents form arayd, With iron scales, like to a plaited mail: Over her back her knotty tail displaid, Along the empty aire did lofty sail: The end was pointed with a double sting, Which with such dreaded might she wont to fling, That nought could help the wound, but bloud of heav'nly King. 29 Of that first woman her the Dragon got, (The foulest bastard of so fair a mother) Whom when she saw so fil'd with monstrous spot, She cast her hidden shame and birth to smother; But she welnigh her mothers self had slain: And all that dare her kindely entertain; So some parts of her damme, more of her sire remain. 30 Her viperous locks hung loose about her eares; Yet with a monstrous snake she them restrains, Which like a border on her head she wears: About her neck hang down long adder chains, In thousand knots, and wreaths infolded round; Which in her anger lightly she unbound, And darting farre away would sure and deadly wound. 31 Yet fair and lovely seems to fools dimme eyes; But hell more lovely, Pluto's self more fair Appeares, when her true form true light descries: Her loathsome face, blancht skinne, and snakie hair, Her shapelesse shape, dead life, her carrion smell, The devils dung, the childe and damme of hell, Is chaffer fit for fools their precious souls to sell. 32 The second in this rank was black Despair, Bred in the dark wombe of eternall Night: His looks fast nail'd to Sinne, long sootie hair Fill'd up his lank cheeks with wide-staring fright: His leaden eyes, retir'd into his head, Light, heav'n, and earth, himself, and all things fled: A breathing coarse he seem'd, wrapt up in living lead. 33 His bodie all was fram'd of earthly paste, And heavie mold; yet earth could not content him: Heav'n fast he flies, and heav'n fled him as fast; Though 'kin to hell, yet hell did much torment him: His very soul was nought but ghastly fright: With him went many a fiend, and ugly sprite, Armed with ropes and knives, all instruments of spite. 34 In stead of feathers, on his dangling crest A lucklesse Raven spred her blackest wings; And to her croaking throat gave never rest, But deathfull verses and sad dirges sings: His hellish arms were all with fiends embost, Who damned souls with endlesse torments roast, And thousand wayes devise to vex the tortur'd ghost. 35 Two weapons sharp as death he ever bore; Strict Judgement, which from farre he deadly darts; Sinne at his side, a two edg'd sword, he wore, With which he soon appalls the stoutest hearts: Upon his shield Alecto with a wreath Of snakie whips the damn'd souls tortureth: And round about was wrote, Reward of sinne is death. 36 The last two brethren were farre different, Onely in common name of death agreeing; The first arm'd with a sithe still mowing went; Yet whom, and when he murder'd, never seeing; Born deaf, and blinde: nothing might stop his way: No prayers, no vows his keenest sithe could stay; Nor Beauties self his spite, nor Vertues self allay. 37 No state, no age, no sex may hope to move him; Down falls the young, and old, the boy, and maid: Nor begger can intreat, nor King reprove him; All are his slaves in's cloth of flesh araid: The bride he snatches from the bridegrooms arms, And horrour brings, in midst of loves alarms: Too well we know his power by long experienc't harms. 38 A dead mans skull suppli'd his helmets place, A bone his club, his armour sheets of lead: Some more, some lesse fear his all-frighting face; But most who sleep in downie pleasures bed: But who in life have daily learnt to die, And dead to this, live to a life more high; Sweetly in death they sleep, and slumbring quiet lie. 39 The second farre more foul in every part, Burnt with blue fire, and bubbling sulphure streams; Which creeping round about him, fill'd with smart His cursed limbes, that direly he blasphemes: Most strange it seems, that burning thus for ever, No rest, no time, no place these flames may sever: Yet death in thousand deaths without death dieth never. 40 Soon as these hellish monsters came in sight, The Sunne his eye in jettie vapours drown'd, Scar'd at such hell-hounds view; heav'ns 'mazed light Sets in an early evening; earth astound, Bids dogs with houls give warning: at which sound The fearfull ayer starts, seas break their bound, And frighted fled away; no sands might them impound. 41 The palsied troop first (like asps shaken) fare; Till now their heart, congeal'd in icie bloud, Candied the ghastly face; locks stand and stare: Thus charm'd, in ranks of stone they marshall'd stood: Their uselesse swords fell idlely on the plain, And now the triumph sounds in loftie strain; So conqu'ring Dragon bindes the Knights with slavish chain. 42 As when proud Phineus in his brothers feast Fill'd all with tumult, and intestine broil; Wise Perseus, with such multitudes opprest, Before him bore the snakie Gorgons spoil: The vulgar rude stood all in marble chang'd, And in vain ranks and rockie order rang'd, Were now more quiet guests, from former rage estrang'd. 43 The fair Eclecta, who with grief had stood, Viewing th' oft changes of this doubtfull fight, Saw now the field swimme in her Champions bloud, And from her heart, rent with deep passion, sigh'd; Limming true sorrow in sad silent art. Light grief floats on the tongue; but heavie smart Sinks down, and deeply lies in centre of the heart. 44 What DÃ¦dal art such griefs can truely shew, Broke heart, deep sighs, thick sobs, &amp; burning prayers, Baptizing ever[y] limbe in weeping dew? Whose swoln eyes, pickled up in brinie tears, Crystalline rocks, corall the lid appeares, Compast about with tides of grief and fears; Where grief stores fear with sighs, and fear stores grief with tears. 45 At length sad Sorrow, mounted on the wings Of loud-breath'd sighs, his leaden weight uprears; And vents it self in softest whisperings, Follow'd with deadly grones, usher'd by tears: While her fair hands, and watrie shining eyes Were upward bent upon the mourning skies, Which seem'd with cloudie brow her grief to sympathize. 46 Long while the silent passion, wanting vent, Made flowing tears her words, and eyes her tongue; Till Faith, Experience, Hope assistance lent To shut both floud-gates up with patience strong: The streams well ebb'd, new hopes some comforts borrow From firmest truth; then glimpst the hopefull morrow: So spring some dawns of joy, so sets the night of sorrow. 47 Ah dearest Lord, my hearts sole Soveraigne, Who sitt'st high mounted on thy burning throne; Heark from thy heav'ns, where thou dost safely reigne, Cloth'd with the golden Sunne, and silver Moon: Cast down a while thy sweet and gracious eye, And low avail that flaming Majestie, Deigning thy gentle sight on our sad miserie. 48 To thee, deare Lord, I lift this watrie eye, This eye which thou so oft in love Cant. 1, 15.hast prais'd; This eye with which thou Cant. 4, 9.wounded oft wouldst die; To thee (deare Lord) these suppliant hands are rais'd: These to be lilies thou hast often told me; Which if but once again may ever hold thee, Will never let thee loose, will never more unfold thee. 49 Seest how thy foes despitefull trophies reare, Too confident in thy prolong'd delayes? Come then, oh quickly come, my dearest deare: When shall I see thee crown'd with conqu'ring bayes, And all thy foes trod down, and spred as clay? When shall I see thy face, and glories ray? Too long thou stay'st, my Love; come Love, no longer stay 50 Hast thou forgot thy former word and love, Or lockt thy sweetnesse up in fierce disdain? In vain didst thou those thousand mischiefs prove? Are all those griefs, thy birth, life, death in vain? Oh no; of ill thou onely dost repent thee, And in thy dainty mercies most content thee: Then why with stay so long so long dost thou torment me? 51 Reviving Cordiall of my dying sprite, The best Elixar for souls drooping pain; Ah now unshade thy face, uncloud thy sight; See, every way's a trap, each path's a train: Hells troops my soul beleaguer; bow thine eares, And hear my cries pierce through my grones &amp; fears: Sweet Spouse, see not my sinnes, but through my plaints and tears. 52 Let frailty favour, sorrow succour move; Anchour my life in thy calm streams of bloud: Be thou my rock, though I poore changeling rove, Tost up and down in waves of worldly floud: Whil'st I in vale of tears at anchour ride, Where windes of earthly thoughts my sails misguide, Harbour my fleshly bark safe in thy wounded side. 53 Take, take my contrite heart, thy sacrifice, Washt in her eyes that swimmes and sinks in woes: See, see, as seas with windes high working rise, So storm, so rage, so gape thy boasting foes. Deare Spouse, unlesse thy right hand even steers, Oh if thou anchour not these threatning fears; Thy ark will sail as deep in bloud, as now in tears. 54 With that a thundring noise seem'd shake the skie, As when with iron wheels through stonie plain A thousand chariots to the battell flie; Or when with boistrous rage the swelling main, Puft up with mighty windes, does hoarsly roar; And beating with his waves the trembling shore, His sandie girdle scorns, &amp; breaks earths ramperd doore. 55 And straight Our late most learned Soveraigne in his remonstrance and comment on the Apocal.an Angel full of heav'nly might, (Three severall crowns circled his royall head) From Northern coast heaving his blazing light, Through all the earth his glorious beams dispread, And open laies the Beasts and Dragons shame: For to this end th' Almighty did him frame, And therefore from supplanting gave his ominous name. 56 A silver trumpet oft he loudly blew, Frighting the guiltie earth with thundring knell; And oft proclaim'd, as through the world he flew, Babel, great Babel lies as low as hell: Let every Angel loud his trumpet sound, Her heav'n-exalted towers in dust are drown'd: Babel, proud Babel's fall'n, and lies as low as ground. 57 The broken heav'ns dispart with fearfull noise, And from the breach out shoots a suddain light; Straight shrilling trumpets with loud sounding voice Give echoing summons to new bloudy fight: Well knew the Dragon that all-quelling blast, And soon perceiv'd that day must be his last; Which strook his frighted heart, &amp; all his troops aghast. 58 Yet full of malice and of stubborn pride, Though oft had strove, and had been foild as oft, Boldly his death and certain fate defi'd: And mounted on his flaggie sails aloft, With boundlesse spite he long'd to try again A second losse, and new death; glad and fain To shew his pois'nous hate, though ever shew'd in vain. 59 So up he rose upon his stretched sails, Fearlesse expecting his approaching death: So up he rose, that th' ayer starts, and fails, And over-pressed sinks his load beneath: So up he rose, as does a thunder-cloud, Which all the earth with shadows black does shroud: So up he rose, and through the weary ayer row'd. 60 Now his Almighty foe farre off he spies; Whose Sun-like arms daz'd the eclipsed day, Confounding with their beams lesse-glitt'ring skies, Firing the aire with more then heav'nly ray; Like thousand Sunnes in one: such is their light; A subject onely for immortall sprite, Which never can be seen, but by immortall sight. 61 His threatning eyes shine like that dreadfull flame, With which the Thunderer arms his angry hand: Himself had fairly wrote his wondrous name, Which neither earth nor heav'n could understand: A hundred crowns, like towers, beset around His conqu'ring head: well may they there abound, When all his limbes and troops with gold are richly crown'd. 62 His armour all was dy'd in purple bloud; (In purple bloud of thousand rebell Kings) In vain their stubborn powers his arm withstood: Their proud necks chain'd he now in triumph brings, And breaks their spears, &amp; cracks their traitour swords Upon whose arms and thigh, in golden words Was fairly writ, The KING of Kings, &amp; LORD of Lords. 63 His snow-white steed was born of heav'nly kinde, Begot by Boreas on the Thracian hills; More strong and speedy then his parent Winde: And (which his foes with fear and horrour fills) Out from his mouth a two-edg'd sword he darts; Whose sharpest steel the bone and marrow parts, And with his keenest point unbreasts the naked hearts. 64 The Dragon, wounded with this flaming brand, They take, and in strong bonds and fetters tie: Short was the fight, nor could he long withstand Him, whose appearance is his victorie. So now he's bound in adamantine chain; He storms, he roars, he yells for high disdain: His net is broke, the fowl go free, the fowler ta'ne. 65 Thence by a mighty Swain he soon was led Unto a thousand thousand torturings: His tail, whose folds were wont the starres to shed, Now stretcht at length, close to his belly clings: Soon as the pit he sees, he back retires, And battel new, but all in vain, respires: So there he deeply lies, flaming in icie fires. 66 As when Alcides from forc't hell had drawn The three-head dog, and master'd all his pride; Basely the fiend did on his Victour fawn, With serpent tail clapping his hollow side: At length arriv'd upon the brink of light, He shuts the day out of his dullard sight, And swelling all in vain renews unhappie fight. 67 Soon at this sight the Knights revive again, As fresh as when the flowers from winter tombe (When now the Sunne brings back his nearer wain) Peep out again from their fresh mothers wombe: The primrose lighted new, her flame displayes, And frights the neighbour hedge with firie rayes: And all the world renew their mirth &amp; sportive playes. 68 The Prince, who saw his long imprisonment Now end in never-ending libertie; To meet the Victour, from his castle went, And falling down, clasping his royall knee, Poures out deserved thanks in gratefull praise: But him the heav'nly Saviour soon doth raise, And bids him spend in joy his never spending dayes. 69 The fair Eclecta, that with widowed brow Her absent Lord long mourn'd in sad aray, Now Revel. 19.8.silken linnen cloth'd like frozen snow, Whose silver spanglets sparkle 'gainst the day: This shining robe her Lord himself had wrought, While he her love with hundred presents sought, And it with many a wound, &amp; many a torment bought. 70 And thus arayd, her heav'nly beauties shin'd (Drawing their beams from his most glorious face) Like to a precious Revel. 21. 11.Jasper, pure refin'd; Which with a Crystall mixt, much mends his grace: The golden starres a garland fair did frame, To crown her locks; the Sunne lay hid for shame, And yeelded all his beams to her more glorious flame. 71 Ah who that flame can tell? ah who can see? Enough is me with silence to admire; While bolder joy, and humb[l]e majestie In either cheek had kindled gracefull fire: Long silent stood she, while her former fears And griefs ran all away in sliding tears; That like a watrie Sunne her gladsome face appeares. 72 At length when joyes had left her closer heart, To seat themselves upon her thankfull tongue; First in her eyes they sudden flashes dart, Then forth i' th' musick of her voice they throng; My Hope, my Love, my Joy, my Life, my Blisse, (Whom to enjoy is heav'n, but hell to misse) What are the worlds false joyes, what heav'ns true joyes to this? 73 Ah dearest Lord! does my rapt soul behold thee? Am I awake? and sure I do not dream? Do these thrice blessed arms again infold thee? Too much delight makes true things feigned seem. Thee, thee I see; thou, thou thus folded art: For deep thy stamp is printed in my heart, And thousand ne're-felt joyes stream in each melting part. 74 Thus with glad sorrow did she sweetly plain her, Upon his neck a welcome load depending; While he with equall joy did entertain her, Her self, her Champions, highly all commending: So all in triumph to his palace went, Whose work in narrow words may not be pent; For boundlesse thought is lesse then is that glorious tent. 75 There sweet delights, which know nor end, nor measure; No chance is there, nor eating times succeeding: No wastfull spending can empair their treasure; Pleasure full grown, yet ever freshly breeding: Fulnesse of sweets excludes not more receiving: The soul still big of joy, yet still conceiving; Beyond slow tongues report, beyond quick thoughts perceiving. 76 There are they gone, there will they ever bide; Swimming in waves of joyes, and heav'nly lov[ing]: He still a Bridegroom, she a gladsome Bride; Their hearts in love, like spheres still constant moving: No change, no grief, no age can them befall: Their bridall bed is in that heav'nly hall, Where all dayes are but one, and onely one is all. 77 And as in state they thus in triumph ride, The boyes and damsels their just praises chaunt; The boyes the Bridegroom sing, the maids the Bride, While all the hills glad Hymens loudly vaunt: Heav'ns winged shoals, greeting this glorious spring, Attune their higher notes, and Hymens sing: Each thought to passe, &amp; each did passe thoughts loftiest wing. 78 Upon his lightning brow Love proudly sitting Flames out in power, shines out in majestie; There all his loftie spoils and trophies fitting, Displayes the marks of highest Deitie: There full of strength in lordly arms he stands, And every heart, and every soul commands: No heart, no soul his strength and lordly force withstands. 79 Upon her forehead thousand cheerfull Graces, Seated in thrones of spotlesse ivorie; There gentle Love his armed hand unbraces, His bow unbent disclaims all tyrannie: There by his play a thousand souls beguiles, Perswading more by simple modest smiles, Then ever he could force by arms, or craftie wiles. 80 Upon her cheek doth Beauties self implant The freshest garden of her choicest flowers; On which if Envie might but glance ascant, Her eyes would swell, and burst, and melt in showers: Thrice fairer both then ever fairest ey'd. Heav'n never such a Bridegroom yet descri'd; Nor ever earth so fair, so undefil'd a Bride. 81 Full of his Father shines his glorious face, As farre the Sunne surpassing in his light, As doth the Sunne the earth with flaming blaze: Sweet influence streams from his quickning sight: His beams from nought did all this All display; And when to lesse then nought they fell away, He soon restor'd again by his new orient ray. 82 All heav'n shines forth in her sweet faces frame: Her seeing Starres (which we miscall bright eyes) More bright then is the mornings brightest flame, More fruitfull then the May-time Geminies: These back restore the timely summers fire; Those springing thoughts in winter hearts inspire, Inspiriting dead souls, and quickning warm desire. 83 These two fair Sunnes in heav'nly sphere are plac't, Where in the centre Joy triumphing sits: Thus in all high perfections fully grac't, Her mid-day blisse no future night admits; But in the mirrours of her Spouses eyes Her fairest self she dresses; there where lies All sweets, a glorious beautie to emparadize. 84 His locks like ravens plumes, or shining jet, Fall down in curls along his ivory neck; Within their circlets hundred Graces set, And with love-knots their comely hangings deck: His mighty shoulders, like that Giant Swain, All heav'n and earth, and all in both sustain; Yet knows no wearinesse, nor feels oppressing pain. 85 Her amber hair, like to the sunnie ray, With gold enamels fair the silver white; There heav'nly loves their prettie sportings play, Firing their darts in that wide flaming light: Her daintie neck, spread with that silver mold, Where double beautie doth it self unfold, In th' own fair silver shines, and fairer borrow'd gold. 86 His breast a rock of purest alabaster, Where Loves self sailing shipwrackt often sitteth; Hers a twinne-rock, unknown, but to th' ship-master; Which harbours him alone, all other splitteth. Where better could her love then here have nested? Or he his thoughts then here more sweetly feasted? Then both their love &amp; thoughts in each are ever rested. 87 Runne now you shepherd-swains; ah run you thither, Where this fair Bridegroom leads the blessed way: And haste you lovely maids, haste you together With this sweet Bride; while yet the sunne-shine day Guides your blinde steps, while yet loud summons call, That every wood &amp; hill resounds withall, Come Hymen, Hymen come, drest in thy golden pall. 88 The sounding Echo back the musick flung, While heav'nly spheres unto the voices playd. But see, the day is ended with my song, And sporting bathes with that fair Ocean Maid: Stoop now thy wing, my Muse, now stoop thee low: Hence mayst thou freely play, and rest thee now; While here I hang my pipe upon the willow bough. 89 So up they rose, while all the shepherds throng With their loud pipes a countrey triumph blew, And led their Thirsil home with joyfull song: Mean time the lovely Nymphs with garlands new His locks in Bay and honour'd Palm-tree bound, With Lilies set, and Hyacinths around; And Lord of all the yeare, and their May-sportings crown'd. FINIS. ???????????, OR, PISCATORIE ECLOGUES. ECLOG. I. AMYNTAS. 1 It was the time faithfull Halcyone, Once more enjoying new-liv'd Ceyx bed, Had left her young birds to the wavering sea, Bidding him calm his proud white-curled head, And change his mountains to a champian lea; The time when gentle Flora's lover reignes, Soft creeping all along green Neptunes smoothest plains; 2 When haplesse Thelgon (a poore fisher-swain) Came from his boat to tell the rocks his plaining: In rocks he found, and the high-swelling main More sense, more pitie farre, more love remaining, Then in the great Amyntas fierce disdain: Was not his peer for song 'mong all the lads, Whose shrilling pipe, or voice the sea-born maiden glads. 3 About his head a rocky canopie, And craggy hangings round a shadow threw, Rebutting PhÅbus parching fervencie; Into his bosome Zephyr softly flew; Hard by his feet the sea came waving by; The while to seas and rocks (poore swain!) he sang; The while the seas &amp; rocks answ'ring loud echoes rang. 4 You goodly Nymphs, that in your marble cell In spending never spend your sportfull dayes, Or when you list in pearled boats of shell Glide on the dancing wave, that leaping playes About the wanton skiffe, and you that dwell In Neptunes court, the Oceans plenteous throng, Deigne you to gently heare sad Thelgons plaining song. 5 When the raw blossome of my youth was yet In my first childhoods green enclosure bound, Of Aquadune I learnt to fold my net, And spread the sail, and beat the river round, And withy labyrinths in straits to set, And guide my boat, where Thames and Isis heire By lowly Ãton slides, and Windsor proudly fair. 6 There while our thinne nets dangling in the winde Hung on our oars tops, I learnt to sing Among my Peers, apt words to fitly binde In numerous verse: witnesse thou crystall Spring, Where all the lads were pebles wont to finde; And you thick hasles, that on Thamis brink Did oft with dallying boughs his silver waters drink. 7 But when my tender youth 'gan fairly blow, I chang'd large Thames for Chamus narrower seas: There as my yeares, so skill with yeares did grow; And now my pipe the better sort did please; So that with Limnus, and with Belgio I durst to challenge all my fisher-peers, That by learn'd Chamus banks did spend their youthfull yeares. 8 And Janus self, that oft with me compared, With his oft losses rais'd my victory; That afterward in song he never dared Provoke my conquering pipe, but enviously Deprave the songs which first his songs had marred; And closely bite, when now he durst not bark, Hating all others light, because himself was dark. 9 And whether nature, joyn'd with art, had wrought me, Or I too much beleev'd the fishers praise; Or whether PhÅbus self, or Muses taught me, Too much enclin'd to verse, and Musick playes; So farre credulitie, and youth had brought me, I sang sad Telethusa's frustrate plaint, And rustick Daphnis wrong, and magicks vain restraint: 10 And then appeas'd young Myrtilus, repining At generall contempt of shepherds life; And rais'd my rime to sing of Richards climbing; And taught our Chame to end the old-bred strife, Mythicus claim to Nicias resigning: The while his goodly Nymphs with song delighted, My notes with choicest flowers, &amp; garlands sweet requited. 11 From thence a Shepherd great, pleas'd with my song, Drew me to Basilissa's Courtly place: Fair Basilissa, fairest maid among The Nymphs that white-cliffe Albions forrests grace. Her errand drove my slender bark along The seas, which wash the fruitfull Germans land, And swelling Rhene, whose wines run swiftly o're the sand. 12 But after bold'ned with my first successe, I durst assay the new-found paths, that led To slavish Mosco's dullard sluggishnesse; Whose slothfull Sunne all winter keeps his bed, But never sleeps in summers wakefulnesse: Yet all for nought: another took the gain: Faitour, that reapt the pleasure of anothers pain! 13 And travelling along the Northern plains, At her command I past the bounding Twead, And liv'd a while with Caledonian swains: My life with fair Amyntas there I led: Amyntas fair, whom still my sore heart plains. Yet seem'd he then to love, as he was loved; But (ah!) I fear, true love his high heart never proved. 14 And now he haunts th'infamous woods and downs, And on NapÃ¦an Nymphs doth wholly dote: What cares he for poore Thelgons plaintfull sounds? Thelgon, poore master of a poorer boat. Janus is crept from his wont prison bounds, And sits the Porter to his eare and minde: What hope, Amyntas love a fisher-swain should finde? 15 Yet once he said, (which I, then fool, beleev'd) (The woods of it, and Damon witnesse be) When in fair Albions fields he first arriv'd, When I forget true Thelgons love to me, The love which ne're my certain hope deceiv'd; The wavering sea shall stand, and rocks remove: He said, and I beleev'd: so credulous is love. 16 You steady rocks, why still do you stand still? You fleeting waves, why do you never stand? Amyntas hath forgot his Thelgons quill; His promise, and his love are writ in sand: But rocks are firm, though Neptune rage his fill; When thou, Amyntas, like the fire-drake rangest: The sea keeps on his course, when like the winde thou changest. 17 Yet as I swiftly sail'd the other day, The setled rock seem'd from his seat remove, And standing waves seem'd doubtfull of their way, And by their stop thy wavering reprove: Sure either this thou didst but mocking say, Or else the rock and sea had heard my plaining. But thou (ay me!) art onely constant in disdaining. 18 Ah! would thou knew'st how much it better were To 'bide among the simple fisher-swains: No shrieching owl, no night-crow lodgeth here; Nor is our simple pleasure mixt with pains: Our sports begin with the beginning yeare, In calms to pull the leaping fish to land, In roughs to sing, and dance along the golden sand. 19 I have a pipe, which once thou lovedst well, (Was never pipe that gave a better sound) Which oft to heare fair Thetis from her cell, Thetis the Queen of seas, attended round With hundred Nymphs and many powers that dwell In th' Oceans rocky walls, came up to heare, And gave me gifts, which still for thee lie hoarded here. 20 Here with sweet bayes the lovely myrtils grow, Where th'Oceans fair-cheekt maidens oft repair; Here to my pipe they dancen on a row: No other swain may come to note their fair; Yet my Amyntas there with me shall go. Proteus himself pipes to his flocks hereby, Whom thou shalt heare, ne're seen by any jealous eye. 21 But (ah!) both me, and fishers he disdains, While I sit piping to the gadding winde, Better that to the boysterous sea complains; Sooner fierce waves are mov'd, then his hard minde: I'le to some rock farre from our common mains, And in his bottome learn forget my smart, And blot Amyntas name from Thelgons wretched heart. 22 So up he rose, and lancht into the deep; Dividing with his oare the surging main, Which dropping seem'd with teares his case to weep; The whistling windes joyn'd with the seas to plain, And o're his boat in whines lamenting creep. Nought feared he fierce Oceans watry ire, Who in his heart of grief and love felt equall fire. FINIS. ECLOG. II. THIRSIL. Dorus, Myrtilus, Thomalin, Thirsil. Dorus. Myrtil, why idle sit we on the shore? Since stormy windes, and waves intestine spite Impatient rage of sail, or bending oare; Sit we, and sing, while windes &amp; waters fight; And carol lowd of love, and loves delight. Myrtil. Dorus, ah rather stormy seas require With sadder song the tempests rage deplore: In calms let's sing of love, and lovers fire. Tell we how Thirsil late our seas forswore, When forc't he left our Chame, and desert shore. Dorus. Now as thou art a lad, repeat that lay; Myrtil, his songs more please my ravisht eare, Then rumbling brooks that with the pebles play, Then murmuring seas broke on the banks to heare, Or windes on rocks their whistling voices teare. Myrtil. Seest thou that rock, which hanging o're the main Looks proudly down? there as I under lay, Thirsil with Thomalin I heard complain, Thomalin, (who now goes sighing all the day) Who thus 'gan tempt his friend with Chamish boyes to stay. Thom. Thirsil, what wicked chance, or lucklesse starre From Chamus streams removes thy boat and minde? Farre hence thy boat is bound, thy minde more farre; More sweet, or fruitfull streams where canst thou finde? Where fisher-lads, or Nymphs more fair, or kinde? The Muses selves sit with the sliding Chame: Chame and the Muses selves do love thy name. Where thou art lov'd so dear, so much to hate is shame. Thirsil. The Muses me forsake, not I the Muses; Thomalin, thou know'st how I them honour'd ever: Not I my Chame, but me proud Chame refuses: His froward spites my strong affections sever; Else, from his banks could I have parted never. But like his Swannes, when now their fate is nigh, Where singing sweet they liv'd, there dead they lie; So would I gladly live, so would I gladly die. 7 His stubborn hands my net hath broken quite: My fish (the guerdon of my toil and pain) He causelesse seaz'd, and with ungratefull spite Bestow'd upon a lesse deserving swain: The cost and labour mine, his all the gain. My boat lies broke; my oares crackt, and gone: Nought h[as] he left me, but my pipe alone, Which with his sadder notes may help his master moan. Thom. Ungratefull Chame! how oft hath Thirsil crown'd With songs and garlands thy obscurer head? That now thy name through Albion loud doth sound. Ah foolish Chame! who now in Thirsils stead Shall chant thy praise, since Thelgon's lately dead? He whom thou lov'st, can neither sing, nor play; His dusty pipe, scorn'd, broke, is cast away: Ah foolish Chame! who now shall grace thy holy-day? Thirsil. Too fond my former hopes! I still expected With my desert his love should grow the more: Ill can he love, who Thelgons love rejected, Thelgon, who more hath grac'd his gracelesse shore, Then any swain that ever sang before. Yet Gripus he prefer'd, when Thelgon strove: I wish no other curse he ever prove; Who Thelgon causelesse hates, still may he Gripus love. Thom. Thirsil, but that so long I know thee well, I now should think thou speak'st of hate, or spite: Can such a wrong with Chame, or Muses dwell, That Thelgons worth and love with hate they 'quite? Thirsil. Thomalin, judge thou; and thou that judgest right, Great King of seas, (that grasp'st the Ocean) heare, If ever thou thy Thelgon lovedst deare: Though thou forbear a while, yet long thou canst not bear. 11 When Thelgon here had spent his prentise-yeares, Soon had he learnt to sing as sweet a note, As ever strook the churlish Chamus eares: To him the river gives a costly boat, That on his waters he might safely float, The songs reward, which oft unto his shore He sweetly tun'd: Then arm'd with sail, and oare, Dearely the gift he lov'd, but lov'd the giver more. 12 Scarce of the boat he yet was full possest, When, with a minde more changing then his wave, Again bequeath'd it to a wandring guest, Whom then he onely saw; to him he gave The sails, and oares: in vain poore Thelgon strave, The boat is under sail, no boot to plain: Then banisht him, the more to eke his pain, As if himself were wrong'd, &amp; did not wrong the swain. 13 From thence he furrow'd many a churlish sea, The viny Rhene, and Volgha's self did passe, Who sleds doth suffer on his watry lea, And horses trampling on his ycie face: Where PhÅbus prison'd in the frozen glasse, All winter cannot move his quenched light, Nor in the heat will drench his chariot bright: Thereby the tedious yeare is all one day and night. 14 Yet little thank, and lesse reward he got: He never learn'd to sooth the itching eare: One day (as chanc't) he spies that painted boat, Which once was his: though his of right it were, He bought it now again, and bought it deare. But Chame to Gripus gave it once again, Gripus the basest and most dung-hil swain, That ever drew a net, or fisht in fruitfull main. 15 Go now, ye fisher-boyes, go learn to play, To play, and sing along your Chamus shore: Go watch, and toyl, go spend the night and day, While windes &amp; waves, while storms &amp; tempests roar; And for your trade consume your life, and store: Lo your reward; thus will your Chamus use you. Why should you plain, that lozel swains refuse you? Chamus good fishers hates, the Muses selves abuse you. Thomal. Ah Thelgon, poorest, but the worthiest swain, That ever grac't unworthy povertie! How ever here thou liv'dst in joylesse pain, Prest down with grief, and patient miserie; Yet shalt thou live when thy proud enemie Shall rot, with scorn and base contempt opprest. Sure now in joy thou safe and glad doth rest, Smil'st at those eager foes, which here thee so molest. Thirsil. Thomalin, mourn not for him: he's sweetly sleeping In Neptunes court, whom here he sought to please; While humming rivers by his cabin creeping, Rock soft his slumbering thoughts in quiet ease: Mourn for thy self, here windes do never cease; Our dying life will better fit thy crying: He softly sleeps, and blest is quiet lying. Who ever living dies, he better lives by dying. Thomal. Can Thirsil then our Chame abandon ever? And never will our fishers see again? Thirsil. Who 'gainst a raging stream doth vain endeavour To drive his boat, gets labour for his pain: When fates command to go, to lagge is vain. As late upon the shore I chanc't to play, I heard a voice, like thunder, lowdly say, Thirsil, why idle liv'st? Thirsil, away, away. 19 Thou God of seas, thy voice I gladly heare; Thy voice (thy voice I know) I glad obey: Onely do thou my wandring whirry steer; And when it erres, (as it will eas'ly stray) Upon the rock with hopefull anchour stay. Then will I swimme, where's either sea, or shore, Where never swain, or boat was seen afore: My trunk shall be my boat, my arm shall be my oare. 20 Thomalin, me thinks I heare thy speaking eye Woo me my posting journey to delay: But let thy love yeeld to necessitie: With thee, my friend, too gladly would I stay, And live, and die: were Thomalin away, (Though now I half unwilling leave his stream) How ever Chame doth Thirsil lightly deem, Yet would thy Thirsil lesse proud Chamus scorns esteem. Thom. Who now with Thomalin shall sit, and sing? Who left to play in lovely myrtils shade? Or tune sweet ditties to as sweet a string? Who now those wounds shall 'swage in covert glade, Sweet-bitter wounds, which cruel love hath made? You fisher-boyes, and sea-maids dainty crue, Farewell; for Thomalin will seek a new, And more respectfull stream: ungratefull Chame adieu. Thirsil. Thomalin, forsake not thou the fisher-swains, Which hold thy stay and love at dearest rate: Here mayst thou live among their sportfull trains, Till better times afford thee better state: Then mayst thou follow well thy guiding fate: So live thou here with peace, and quiet blest; So let thy love afford thee ease and rest; So let thy sweetest foe recure thy wounded breast. 23 But thou, proud Chame, which thus hast wrought me spite, Some greater river drown thy hatefull name: Let never myrtle on thy banks delight, But willows pale, the badge of spite and blame, Crown thy ungratefull shores with scorn and shame. Let dirt and mud thy lazie waters seise, Thy weeds still grow, thy waters still decrease: Nor let thy wretched love to Gripus ever cease. 24 Farewell ye streams, which once I loved deare; Farewell ye boyes, which on your Chame do float; Muses farewell, if there be Muses here; Farewell my nets, farewell my little boat: Come sadder pipe, farewell my merry note: My Thomalin, with thee all sweetnesse dwell; Think of thy Thirsil, Thirsil loves thee well. Thomalin, my dearest deare, my Thomalin, farewell. Dorus. Ah haplesse boy, the fishers joy and pride! Ah wo is us we cannot help thy wo! Our pity vain: ill may that swain betide, Whose undeserved spite hath wrong'd thee so. Thirsil, with thee our joy, and wishes go. Myrtil. Dorus, some greater power prevents thy curse: So vile, so basely lives that hatefull swain; So base, so vile, that none can wish him worse. But Thirsil much a better state doth gain, For never will he finde so thanklesse main. FINIS. ECLOG. III. MYRTILUS. 1 A fisher-lad (no higher dares he look) Myrtil, sat down by silver Medwayes shore: His dangling nets (hung on the trembling oare) Had leave to play, so had his idle hook, While madding windes the madder Ocean shook. Of Chamus had he learnt to pipe, and sing, And frame low ditties to his humble string. 2 There as his boat late in the river stray'd, A friendly fisher brought the boy to view CÅlia the fair, whose lovely beauties drew His heart from him into that heav'nly maid: There all his wandring thoughts, there now they staid. All other fairs, all other love defies, In CÅlia he lives, for CÅlia dies. 3 Nor durst the coward woo his high desiring, (For low he was, lower himself accounts; And she the highest height in worth surmounts) But sits alone in hell his heav'n admiring, And thinks with sighs to fanne, but blows his firing. Nor does he strive to cure his painfull wound; For till this sicknesse never was he sound. 4 His blubber'd face was temper'd to the day; All sad he look't, that sure all was not well; Deep in his heart was hid an heav'nly hell; Thick clouds upon his watrie eye-brows lay, Which melting showre, and showring never stay: So sitting down upon the sandy plain, Thus 'gan he vent his grief, and hidden pain; 5 You sea-born maids, that in the Ocean reigne, (If in your courts is known Loves matchlesse power, Kindling his fire in your cold watry bower) Learn by your own to pity others pain. Tryphon, that know'st a thousand herbs in vain, But know'st not one to cure a love-sick heart, See here a wound, that farre outgoes thy art. 6 Your stately seas (perhaps with loves fire) glow, And over-seeth their banks with springing tide, Mustring their white-plum'd waves with lordly pride, They soon retire, and lay their curl'd heads low; So sinking in themselves they backward go: But in my breast full seas of grief remain, Which ever flow, and never ebbe again. 7 How well, fair Thetis, in thy glasse I see, As in a crystal, all my raging pains! Late thy green fields slept in their even plains, While smiling heav'ns spread round a canopie: Now tost with blasts, and civil enmitie, While whistling windes blow trumpets to their fight, And roaring waves, as drummes, whet on their spite. 8 Such cruel storms my restles heart command: Late thousand joyes securely lodged there, Ne fear'd I then to care, ne car'd to fear; But pull'd the prison'd fishes to the land, Or (spite of windes) pip't on the golden sand: But since love sway'd my breast, these seas alarms Are but dead pictures of my raging harms. 9 Love stirres desire; desire, like stormy winde, Blows up high swelling waves of hope, and fear: Hope on his top my trembling heart doth bear Up to my heav'n, but straight my lofty minde By fear sunk in despair deep drown'd I finde. But (ah!) your tempests cannot last for ever; But (ah!) my storms (I fear) will leave me never. 10 Haples, and fond! too fond, more haples swain, Who lovest where th'art scorn'd, scorn'st where th'art loved: Or learn to hate, where thou hast hatred proved; Or learn to love, where thou art lov'd again: Ah cease to love, or cease to woo thy pain. Thy love thus scorn'd is hell; do not so earn it; At least learn by forgetting to unlearn it. 11 Ah fond, and haples swain! but much more fond, How canst unlearn by learning to forget it, When thought of what thou should'st unlearn does whet it, And surer ties thy minde in captive bond? Canst thou unlearn a ditty thou hast con'd? Canst thou forget a song by oft repeating? Thus much more wilt thou learn by thy forgetting. 12 Haplesse, and fond! most fond, more haplesse swain! Seeing thy rooted love will leave thee never, (She hates thy love) love thou her hate for ever: In vain thou hop'st, hope yet, though still in vain: Joy in thy grief, and triumph in thy pain: And though reward exceedeth thy aspiring, Live in her love, and die in her admiring. 13 Fair-cruel maid, most cruel, fairer ever, How hath foul rigour stol'n into thy heart? And on a comick stage hath learnt thee art To play a Tyrant-tragical deceiver? To promise mercy, but perform it never? To look more sweet, maskt in thy looks disguise, Then Mercy self can look with Pities eyes? 14 Who taught thy honied tongue the cunning slight, To melt the ravisht eare with musicks strains? And charm the sense with thousand pleasing pains? And yet, like thunder roll'd in flames, and night, To break the rived heart with fear and fright? How rules therein thy breast, so quiet state, Spite leagu'd with mercy, love with lovelesse hate? 15 Ah no, fair CÅlia, in thy sunne-like eye Heav'n sweetly smiles; those starres soft loving fire, And living heat, not burning flames inspire: Love's self enthron'd in thy brows ivorie, And every grace in heavens liverie: My wants, not thine, me in despairing drown: When hell presumes, no mar'l if heavens frown. 16 Those gracefull tunes, issuing from glorious spheares, Ravish the eare and soul with strange delight, And with sweet Nectar fill the thirsty sprite; Thy honied tongue, charming the melted eares, Stills stormy hearts, and quiets frights and fears: My daring heart provokes thee; and no wonder, When earth so high aspires, if heavens thunder. 17 See, see, fair CÅlia, seas are calmly laid, And end their boisterous threats in quiet peace; The waves their drummes, the windes their trumpets cease: But my sick love (ah love full ill apayd!) Never can hope his storms may be allayd; But giving to his rage no end, or leisure, Still restles rests: Love knows no mean or measure. 18 Fond boy, she justly scorns thy proud desire, While thou with singing would'st forget thy pain: Go strive to empty the still-flowing main: Go fuell seek to quench thy growing fire: Ah foolish boy! scorn is thy musicks hire. Drown then these flames in seas: but (ah!) I fear To fire the main, and to want water there. 19 There first thy heav'n I saw, there felt my hell; There smooth-calm seas rais'd storms of fierce desires; There cooling waters kindled burning fires, Nor can the Ocean quench them: in thy cell Full stor'd with pleasures, all my pleasures fell. Die then, fond lad: ah, well my death may please thee: But love, (thy love) not life, not death, must ease me. 20 So down he swowning sinks; nor can remove, Till fisher-boyes (fond fisher-boyes) revive him, And back again his life and loving give him: But he such wofull gift doth much reprove: Hopelesse his life; for hopelesse is his love. Go then, most loving, but most dolefull swain: Well may I pitie; she must cure thy pain. FINIS. ECLOG. IIII. CHROMIS. Thelgon. Chromis. Thel. Chromis my joy, why drop thy rainie eyes? And sullen clouds hang on thy heavie brow? Seems that thy net is rent, and idle lies; Thy merry pipe hangs broken on a bough: But late thy time in hundred joyes thou spent'st; Now time spends thee, while thou in vain lament'st. Chrom. Thelgon, my pipe is whole, and nets are new: But nets and pipe contemn'd, and idle lie: My little reed, that late so merry blew, Tunes sad notes to his masters miserie: Time is my foe, and hates my rugged rimes: And I as much hate both that hate, and times. Thel. What is it then that causeth thy unrest? Or wicked charms? or loves new-kindled fire? Ah! much I fear love eats thy tender breast; Too well I know his never quenched ire, Since I Amyntas lov'd, who me disdains, And loves in me nought but my grief and pains. Chrom. No lack of love did ever breed my smart: I onely learn'd to pity others pain, And ward my breast from his deceiving art: But one I love, and he loves me again; In love this onely is my greatest sore, He loves so much, and I can love no more. 5 But when the fishers trade, once highly priz'd, And justly honour'd in those better times, By every lozel-groom I see despis'd; No marvel if I hate my jocond rimes, And hang my pipe upon a willow bough: Might I grieve ever, if I grieve not now. Thel. Ah foolish boy! why should'st thou so lament To be like him, whom thou dost like so well? The Prince of fishers thousand tortures rent. To heav'n, lad, thou art bound: the way by hell. Would'st thou ador'd, and great and merry be, When he was mockt, debas'd, and dead for thee? 7 Mens scorns should rather joy, then sorrow move; For then thou highest art, when thou art down. Their storms of hate should more blow up my love; Their laughters my applause, their mocks my crown. Sorrow for him, and shame let me betide, Who for me wretch in shame and sorrow died. Chrom. Thelgon, 'tis not my self for whom I plain, My private losse full easie could I bear, If private losse might help the publick gain: But who can blame my grief, or chide my fear, Since now the fishers trade, and honour'd name Is made the common badge of scorn and shame? 9 Little know they the fishers toilsome pain, Whose labour with his age, still growing, spends not: His care and watchings (oft mis[s]pent in vain) The early morn begins, dark evening ends not. Too foolish men, that think all labour stands In travell of the feet, and tired hands! 10 Ah wretched fishers! born to hate and strife; To others good, but to your rape and spoil. This is the briefest summe of fishers life, To sweat, to freeze, to watch, to fast, to toil, Hated to love, to live despis'd, forlorn, A sorrow to himself, all others scorn. Thel. Too well I know the fishers thanklesse pain, Yet bear it cheerfully, nor dare repine. To grudge at losse is fond, (too fond and vain) When highest causes justly it assigne. Who bites the stone, and yet the dog condemnes, Much worse is then the beast he so contemnes. 12 Chromis, how many fishers dost thou know, That rule their boats, and use their nets aright? That neither winde, nor time, nor tide foreslow? Such some have been; but (ah!) by tempests spite Their boats are lost; while we may sit and moan, That few were such, and now those few are none. Chrom. Ah cruel spite, and spitefull crueltie, That thus hath robb'd our joy, and desert shore! No more our seas shall heare your melodie; Your songs and shrilling pipes shall sound no more: Silent our shores, our seas are vacant quite. Ah spitefull crueltie, and cruel spite! Thel. In stead of these a crue of idle grooms, Idle, and bold, that never saw the seas, Fearlesse succeed, and fill their empty rooms: Some lazy live, bathing in wealth and ease: Their floating boats with waves have leave to play, Their rusty hooks all yeare keep holy-day. 15 Here stray their skiffes, themselves are never here, Ne're saw their boats: ill mought they fishers be: Mean time some wanton boy the boat doth steer, (Poore boat the while!) that cares as much as he: Who in a brook a whirry cannot row, Now backs the seas, before the seas he know. Chrom. Ah foolish lads, that think with waves to play, And rule rough seas, which never knew command! First in some river thy new skill assay, Till time and practise teach thy weakly hand: A thin, thin plank keeps in thy vitall breath: Death ready waits. Fond boyes, to play with death! Thel. Some stretching in their boats supinely sleep, Seasons in vain recall'd, and windes neglecting: Other their hooks and baits in poison steep, Neptune himself with deathfull drugges infecting: The fish their life and death together drink, And dead pollute the seas with venom'd stink. 18 Some teach to work, but have no hands to row: Some will be eyes, but have no light to see: Some will be guides, but have no feet to go: Some deaf, yet eares; some dumbe, yet tongues will be: Dumbe, deaf, lame, blinde, and maim'd; yet fishers all: Fit for no use, but store an hospital. 19 Some greater, scorning now their narrow boat, In mighty hulks and ships (like courts) do dwell; Slaving the skiffes that in their seas do float; Their silken sails with windes do proudly swell; Their narrow bottomes stretch they large and wide, And make full room for luxurie and pride. 20 Self did I see a swain not long ago, Whose lordly ship kept all the rest in aw: About him thousand boats do waiting row; His frowns are death, his word is firmest law; While all the fisher-boyes their bonnets vail, And farre adore their lord with strucken sail. 21 His eare is shut to simple fisher-swain. For Gemma's self (a sea-nymph great and high) Upon his boat attended long in vain: What hope, poore fisher-boy may come him nigh? His speech to her, and presence he denied. Had Neptune come, Neptune he had defied. 22 Where Tybers swelling waves his banks o'reflow, There princely fishers dwell in courtly halls: The trade they scorn, their hands forget to row; Their trade, to plot their rising, others falls; Into their seas to draw the lesser brooks, And fish for steeples high with golden hooks. Chrom. Thelgon, how canst thou well that fisher blame, Who in his art so highly doth excell, That with himself can raise the fishers name? Well may he thrive, that spends his art so well. Ah, little needs their honour to depresse: Little it is; yet most would have it lesse. Thel. Alas poore boy! thy shallow-swimming sight Can never dive into their deepest art; Those silken shews so dimme thy dazel'd sight. Could'st thou unmask their pomp, unbreast their heart, How would'st thou laugh at this rich beggerie! And learn to hate such happy miserie! 25 Panting ambition spurres their tired breast: Hope chain'd to doubt, fear linkt to pride and threat, (Too ill yok't pairs) give them no time to rest; Tyrants to lesser boats, slaves to the great. That man I rather pity, then adore, Who fear'd by others much, fears others more. 26 Most cursed town, where but one tyrant reignes: (Though lesse his single rage on many spent) But much more miserie that soul remains, When many tyrants in one heart are pent: When thus thou serv'st, the comfort thou canst have From greatnesse is, thou art a greater slave. Chrom. Ah wretched swains, that live in fishers trade; With inward griefs, and outward wants distressed; While every day doth more your sorrow lade; By others scorn'd, and by your selves oppressed! The great the greater serve, the lesser these: And all their art is how to rise and please. Algon. Those fisher-swains, from whom our trade doth flow, That by the King of seas their skill were taught; As they their boats on Jordan wave did row, And catching fish, were by a Fisher caught; (Ah blessed chance! much better was the trade, That being fishers, thus were fishes made). 29 Those happy swains, in outward shew unblest, Were scourg'd, were scorn'd, yet was this losse their gain: By land, by sea, in life, in death, distrest; But now with King of seas securely reigne: For that short wo in this base earthly dwelling, Enjoying joy all excellence excelling. 30 Then do not thou, my boy, cast down thy minde, But seek to please with all thy busie care The King of seas; so shalt thou surely finde Rest, quiet, joy, in all this troublous fare. Let not thy net, thy hook, thy singing cease: And pray these tempests may be turn'd to peace. 31 Oh Prince of waters, Soveraigne of seas, Whom storms &amp; calms, whom windes and waves obey; If ever that great Fisher did thee please, Chide thou the windes, and furious waves allay: So on thy shore the fisher-boys shall sing Sweet songs of peace to our sweet peaces King. FINIS. ECLOG. V. NICÃA. Damon, Algon, NicÃ¦a. 1 The well known fisher-boy, that late his name, And place, and (ah for pity!) mirth had changed; Which from the Muses spring, &amp; churlish Chame Was fled, (his glory late, but now his shame: For he with spite the gentle boy estranged) Now'long the Trent with his new fellows ranged: There Damon (friendly Damon) met the boy, Where lordly Trent kisses the Darwin coy, Bathing his liquid streams in lovers melting joy. Damon. Algon, what lucklesse starre thy mirth hath blasted? My joy in thee, and thou in sorrow drown'd. The yeare with winter storms all rent and wasted Hath now fresh youth and gentler seasons tasted: The warmer sunne his bride hath newly gown'd, With firie arms clipping the wanton ground, And gets an heav'n on earth: that primrose there, Which 'mongst those violets sheds his golden hair, Seems the sunnes little sonne, fixt in his azure spheare. 3 Seest how the dancing lambes on flowrie banks Forget their food, to minde their sweeter play? Seest how they skip, and in their wanton pranks Bound o're the hillocks, set in sportfull ranks? They skip, they vault; full little caren they To make their milkie mothers bleating stay. Seest how the salmons (waters colder nation) Lately arriv'd from their sea-navigation, How joy leaps in their heart, shew by their leaping fashion? 4 What witch enchants thy minde with sullen madnes? When all things smile, thou onely sitt'st complaining. Algon. Damon, I, onely I, have cause of sadnesse: The more my wo, to weep in common gladnesse: When all eyes shine, mine onely must be raining; No winter now, but in my breast, remaining: Yet feels this breast a summers burning fever: And yet (alas!) my winter thaweth never: And yet (alas!) this fire eats and consumes me ever. Damon. Within our Darwin, in her rockie cell A Nymph there lives, which thousand boys hath harm'd; All as she gliding rides in boats of shell, Darting her eye, (where spite and beauty dwell: Ay me, that spite with beautie should be arm'd!) Her witching eye the boy, and boat hath charm'd. No sooner drinks he down that poisonous eye, But mourns and pines: (ah piteous crueltie!) With her he longs to live; for her he longs to die. Algon. Damon, what Tryphon taught thine eye the art By these few signes to search so soon, so well, A wound deep hid, deep in my fester'd heart, Pierc't by her eye, Loves, and deaths pleasing dart? Ah, she it is, an earthly heav'n, and hell, Who thus hath charm'd my heart with sugred spell. Ease thou my wound: but (ah!) what hand can ease, Or give a medicine that such wound may please; When she my sole Physician is my souls disease? Damon. Poore boy! the wounds which spite and Love impart, There is no ward to fence, no herb to ease. Heav'ns circling folds lie open to his dart: Hells Lethe's self cools not his burning smart: The fishes cold flame with this strong disease, And want their water in the midst of seas: All are his slaves, hell, earth, and heav'n above: Strive not i'th' net, in vain thy force to prove. Give, woo, sigh, weep, &amp; pray: Love's only cur'd by love. Algon. If for thy love no other cure there be, Love, thou art cureles: gifts, prayers, vows, and art, She scorns both you and me: nay Love, ev'n thee: Thou sigh'st her prisoner, while she laughs as free. What ever charms might move a gentle heart, I oft have try'd, and shew'd the earnfull smart, Which eats my breast: she laughs at all my pain: Art, prayers, vows, gifts, love, grief, she does disdain: Grief, love, gifts, vows, prayers, art; ye all are spent in vain. Damon. Algon, oft hast thou fisht, but sped not straight; With hook and net thou beat'st the water round: Oft-times the place thou changest, oft the bait; And catching nothing, still, and still dost wait: Learn by thy trade to cure thee: time hath found In desp'rate cures a salve for every wound. The fish long playing with the baited hook, At last is caught: Thus many a Nymph is took; Mocking the strokes of Love, is with her striking strook. Algon. The marbles self is pierc't with drops of rain: Fires soften steel, and hardest metals try: But she more hard then both: such her disdain, That seas of tears, Ãtna's of love are vain. In her strange heart (weep I, burn, pine, or die) Still reignes a cold, coy, carelesse apathie. The rock that bears her name, breeds that hard stone With goats bloud onely softned, she with none: More precious she, and (ah!) more hard then diamond. 11 That rock I think her mother: thence she took Her name and nature: Damon, Damon, see, See where she comes, arm'd with a line and hook: Tell me, perhaps thou think'st, in that sweet look, The white is beauties native tapestrie; 'Tis crystall, (friend) yc'd in the frozen sea: The red is rubies; these two joyn'd in one, Make up that beauteous frame: the difference none But this; she is a precious, living, speaking stone. Damon. No gemme so costly, but with cost is bought: The hardest stone is cut, and fram'd by art: A diamond hid in rocks is found, if sought: Be she a diamond, a diamond's wrought. Thy fear congeales, thy fainting steels her heart. I'le be thy Captain, boy, and take thy part: Alcides self would never combat two. Take courage, Algon; I will teach thee woo. Cold beggars freez our gifts: thy faint suit breeds her no. 13 Speak to her, boy. Al. Love is more deaf then blinde. Damon. She must be woo'd. Al. Love's tongue is in the eyes. Damon. Speech is Love's dart. Al. Silence best speaks the minde. Damon. Her eye invites. Al. Thence love and death I finde. Damon. Her smiles speak peace. Al. Storms breed in smiling skies. Damon. Who silent loves? Al. Whom speech all hope denies. Damon. Why should'st thou fear? Al. To Love Fear's neare akinne. Damon. Well, if my cunning fail not, by a gin (Spite of her scorn, thy fear) I'le make thee woo, and winne. What, ho, thou fairest maid, turn back thine oare, And gently deigne to help a fishers smart. NicÃ¦a. Are thy lines broke? or are thy trammels tore? If thou desir'st my help, unhide the sore. [Damon.] ] Ah gentlest Nymph, oft have I heard, thy art Can soveraigne herbs to every grief impart: So mayst thou live the fishers song, and joy, As thou wilt deigne to cure this sickly boy. Unworthy they of art, who of their art are coy. 15 His inward grief in outward change appeares; His cheeks with sudden fires bright-flaming glow; Which quencht, end all in ashes: storms of teares Becloud his eyes, which soon forc't smiling cleares: Thick tides of passions ever ebbe, and flow: And as his flesh still wastes, his griefs still grow. NicÃ¦a. Damon, the wounds deep rankling in the minde What herb could ever cure? what art could finde? Blinde are mine eyes to see wounds in the soul most blinde. Algon. Hard maid, t'is worse to mock, then make a wound: Why should'st thou then (fair-cruel) scorn to see What thou by seeing mad'st? my sorrows ground Was in thy eye, may by thy eye be found. How can thy eye most sharp in wounding be, In seeing dull? these two are one in thee, To see, and wound by sight: thy eye the dart. Fair-cruel maid, thou well hast learn'd the art, With the same eye to see, to wound, to cure my heart. NicÃ¦a. What cures thy wounded heart? Algon. Thy heart so wounded. NicÃ¦a. Is't love to wound thy love? Algon. Loves wounds are pleasing. NicÃ¦a. Why plain'st thou then? Al. Because thou art unwounded. Thy wound my cure: on this my plaint is grounded. NicÃ¦a. Cures are diseases, when the wounds are easing: Why would'st thou have me please thee by displeasing? Algon. Scorn'd love is death; loves mutuall wounds delighting: Happie thy love, my love to thine uniting. Love paying debts grows rich; requited in requiting. Damon. What lives alone, NicÃ¦a? starres most chaste Have their conjunctions, spheares their mixt embraces, And mutuall folds. Nothing can single last: But die in living, in increasing waste. NicÃ¦a. Their joyning perfects them, but us defaces. Algon. That's perfect which obtains his end: your graces Receive their end in love. She that's alone Dies as she lives: no number is in one: Thus while she's but her self, she's not her self, she's none. NicÃ¦a. Why blam'st thou then my stonie hard confection, Which nothing loves? thou single nothing art. Algon. Love perfects what it loves; thus thy affection Married to mine, makes mine and thy perfection. NicÃ¦a. Well then, to passe our Tryphon in his art, And in a moment cure a wounded heart; If fairest Darwin, whom I serve, approve Thy suit, and thou wilt not thy heart remove; I'le joyn my heart to thine, and answer thee in love. 20 The sunne is set; adieu. Algon. 'Tis set to me; Thy parting is my ev'n, thy presence light. NicÃ¦a. Farewell. Algon. Thou giv'st thy wish; it is in thee: Unlesse thou wilt, haplesse I cannot be. Damon. Come Algon, cheerly home; the theevish night Steals on the world, and robs our eyes of sight. The silver streams grow black: home let us coast: There of loves conquest may we safely boast: Soonest in love he winnes, that oft in love hath lost. FINIS. ECLOG. VI. THOMALIN. Thirsil, Thomalin. 1 A fisher-boy that never knew his peer In daintie songs, the gentle Thomalin, With folded arms, deep sighs, &amp; heavy cheer Where hundred Nymphs, &amp; hundred Muses inne, Sunk down by Chamus brinks; with him his deare, Deare Thirsil lay; oft times would he begin To cure his grief, and better way advise; But still his words, when his sad friend he spies, Forsook his silent tongue, to speak in watrie eyes. 2 Under a sprouting vine they carelesse lie, Whose tender leaves bit with the Eastern blast, But now were born, and now began to die; The latter warned by the formers haste, Thinly for fear salute the envious skie: Thus as they sat, Thirsil embracing fast His loved friend, feeling his panting heart To give no rest to his increasing smart, At length thus spake, while sighs words to his grief impart: Thirsil. Thomalin, I see thy Thirsil thou neglect'st, Some greater love holds down thy heart in fear; Thy Thirsils love, and counsel thou reject'st; Thy soul was wont to lodge within my eare: But now that port no longer thou respect'st; Yet hath it still been safely harbour'd there. My eare is not acquainted with my tongue, That either tongue, or eare should do thee wrong: Why then should'st thou conceal thy hidden grief so long? Thom. Thirsil, it is thy love that makes me hide My smother'd grief from thy known faithfull eare: May still my Thirsil safe, and merry 'bide; Enough is me my hidden grief to bear: For while thy breast in hav'n doth safely ride, My greater half with thee rides safely there. Thirsil. So thou art well; but still my better part, My Thomalin, sinks loaden with his smart: Thus thou my finger cur'st, and wound'st my bleeding heart. 5 How oft hath Thomalin to Thirsil vowed, That as his heart, so he his love esteem'd! Where are those oaths? where is that heart bestowed, Which hides it from that breast which deare it deem'd, And to that heart room in his heart allowed? That love was never love, but onely seem'd. Tell me, my Thomalin, what envious thief Thus robs thy joy: tell me, my liefest lief: Thou little lov'st me, friend, if more thou lov'st thy grief. Thom. Thirsil, my joyous spring is blasted quite, And winter storms prevent the summers ray: All as this vine, whose green the Eastern spite Hath di'd to black, his catching arms decay, And letting go their hold for want of might, Mar'l winter comes so soon, in first of May. Thirsil. Yet see the leaves do freshly bud again: Thou drooping still di'st in this heavie strain: Nor can I see or end or cause of all thy pain. Thom. No marvel, Thirsil, if thou dost not know This grief, which in my heart lies deeply drown'd: My heart it self, though well it feels his wo, Knows not the wo it feels: the worse my wound, Which though I rankling finde, I cannot show. Thousand fond passions in my breast abound; Fear leagu'd to joy, hope and despair together, Sighs bound to smiles; my heart though prone to either, While both it would obey, 'twixt both obeyeth neither. 8 Oft blushing flames leap up into my face; My guiltlesse cheek such purple flash admires: Oft stealing tears slip from mine eyes apace, As if they meant to quench those causelesse fires. My good I hate; my hurt I glad embrace: My heart though griev'd, his grief as joy desires: I burn, yet know no fuel to my firing: My wishes know no want, yet still desiring: Hope knows not what to hope, yet still in hope aspiring. Thirsil. Too true my fears: alas, no wicked sprite, No writhel'd witch, with spells or powerfull charms, Or hellish herbs digg'd in as hellish night, Gives to thy heart these oft and fierce alarms: But Love, too hatefull Love, with pleasing spite, And spitefull pleasure, thus hath bred thy harms, And seeks thy mirth with pleasance to destroy. 'Tis Love, my Thomalin, my liefest boy; 'Tis Love robs me of thee, and thee of all thy joy. Thomal. Thirsil, I ken not what is hate, or Love, Thee well I love, and thou lov'st me as well; Yet joy, no torment, in this passion prove: But often have I heard the fishers tell, He's not inferiour to the mighty Jove; Jove heaven rules; Love Jove, heav'n, earth, and hell: Tell me, my friend, if thou dost better know: Men say, he goes arm'd with his shafts, and bow; Two darts, one swift as fire, as lead the other slow. Thirsil. Ah heedlesse boy! Love is not such a lad, As he is fancy'd by the idle swain; With bow and shafts, and purple feathers clad; Such as Diana (with her buskin'd train Of armed Nymphs along the forrests glade With golden quivers) in Thessalian plain, In level race outstrips the jumping Deer With nimble feet; or with a mighty spear Flings down a bristled bore, or els a squalid bear. 12 Love's sooner felt, then seen: his substance thinne Betwixt those snowy mounts in ambush lies: Oft in the eyes he spreads his subtil ginne; He therefore soonest winnes, that fastest flies. Fly thence my deare, fly fast, my Thomalin: Who him encounters once, for ever dies: But if he lurk between the ruddy lips, Unhappie soul that thence his Nectar sips, While down into his heart the sugred poison slips! 13 Oft in a voice he creeps down through the eare: Oft from a blushing cheek he lights his fire: Oft shrouds his golden flame in likest hair: Oft in a soft-smooth skin doth close retire: Oft in a smile; oft in a silent tear: And if all fail, yet Vertue's self he'l hire: Himself's a dart, when nothing els can move. Who then the captive soul can well reprove, When Love, and Vertue's self become the darts of Love? Thom Sure, Love it is, which breeds this burning fever: For late (yet all too soon) on Venus day, I chanc't (Oh cursed chance, yet blessed ever!) As carelesse on the silent shores I stray, Five Nymphs to see (five fairer saw I never) Upon the golden sand to dance and play: The rest among, yet farre above the rest, Sweet Melite, by whom my wounded breast, Though rankling still in grief, yet joyes in his unrest. 15 There to their sportings while I pipe, and sing, Out from her eyes I felt a firie beam, And pleasing heat (such as in first of Spring From Sol, inn'd in the Bull, do kindly stream) To warm my heart, and with a gentle sting Blow up desire: yet little did I dream Such bitter fruits from such sweet roots could grow, Or from so gentle eye such spite could flow: For who could fire expect hid in an hill of snow? 16 But when those lips (those melting lips) I prest, I lost my heart, which sure she stole away: For with a blush she soon her guilt confest, And sighs (which sweetest breath did soft convey) Betraid her theft: from thence my flaming breast Like thundring Ãtna burns both night and day: All day she present is, and in the night My wakefull fancie paints her full to sight: Absence her presence makes, darknes presents her light. Thirsil. Thomalin, too well those bitter sweets I know, Since fair NicÃ¦a bred my pleasing smart: But better times did better reason show, And cur'd those burning wounds with heav'nly art. Those storms of looser fire are laid full low; And higher love safe anchours in my heart: So now a quiet calm does safely reigne. And if my friend think not my counsel vain; Perhaps my art may cure, or much asswage thy pain. Thom. Thirsil, although this witching grief doth please My captive heart, and Love doth more detest The cure, and curer, then the sweet disease; Yet if my Thirsil doth the cure request, This storm, which rocks my heart in slumbring ease, Spite of it self, shall yeeld to thy behest. Thirsil. Then heark how Tryphons self did salve my paining, While in a rock I sat of love complaining; My wounds with herbs, my grief with counsel sage restraining. 19 But tell me first; Why should thy partial minde More Melite, then all the rest approve? Thom. Thirsil, her beautie all the rest did blinde, That she alone seem'd worthy of my love. Delight upon her face, and sweetnesse shin'd: Her eyes do spark as starres, as starres do move: Like those twin-fires, which on our masts appear, And promise calms. Ah that those flames so clear To me alone should raise such storms of hope and fear! Thirsil. If that which to thy minde doth worthiest seem, By thy wel-temper'd soul is most affected; Canst thou a face worthy thy love esteem? What in thy soul then love is more respected? Those eyes which in their spheare thou, fond, dost deem Like living starres, with some disease infected, Are dull as leaden drosse: those beauteous rayes, So like a rose, when she her breast displayes, Are like a rose indeed; as sweet, as soon decayes. 21 Art thou in love with words? her words are winde, As flit as is their matter, flittest aire. Her beautie moves? can colours move thy minde? Colours in scorned weeds more sweet, and fair. Some pleasing qualitie thy thoughts doth binde? Love then thy self. Perhaps her golden hair? False metall, which to silver soon descends! Is't pleasure then which so thy fancie bends? Poore pleasure, that in pain begins, in sorrow ends! 22 What? is't her company so much contents thee? How would she present stirre up stormy weather, When thus in absence present she torments thee? Lov'st thou not one, but all these joyn'd together? All's but a woman. Is't her love that rents thee? Light windes, light aire; her love more light then either. If then due worth thy true affection moves, Here is no worth. Who some old hagge approves, And scorns a beauteous spouse, he rather dotes, then loves. 23 Then let thy love mount from these baser things, And to the highest love, and worth aspire: Love's born of fire, fitted with mounting wings; That at his highest he might winde him higher; Base love, that to base earth so basely clings! Look as the beams of that celestiall fire Put out these earthly flames with purer ray; So shall that love this baser heat allay, And quench these coals of earth with his more heav'nly day. 24 Raise then thy prostrate love with towring thought; And clog it not in chains, and prison here: The God of fishers deare thy love hath bought: Most deare he loves: for shame, love thou as deare. Next, love thou there, where best thy love is sought; My self, or els some other fitting peer. Ah might thy love with me for ever dwell! Why should'st thou hate thy heav'n, and love thy hell? She shall not more deserve, nor cannot love so well. 25 Thus Tryphon once did wean my fond affection; Then fits a salve unto th' infected place, (A salve of soveraigne and strange confection) Nepenthe mixt with Rue, and Herb-de-grace: So did he quickly heal this strong infection, And to my self restor'd my self apace. Yet did he not my love extinguish quite: I love with sweeter love, and more delight: But most I love that Love, which to my love h[as] right. Thom. Thrice happy thou that could'st! my weaker minde Can never learn to climbe so lofty flight. Thirsil. If from this love thy will thou canst unbinde; To will, is here to can: will gives thee might: 'Tis done, if once thou wilt; 'tis done, I finde. Now let us home: for see, the creeping night Steals from those further waves upon the land. To morrow shall we feast; then hand in hand Free will we sing, and dance along the golden sand. FINIS. ECLOG. VII. The PRIZE. Thirsil, Daphnis, Thomalin. 1 Aurora from old Tithons frosty bed (Cold, wintry, wither'd Tithon) early creeps; Her cheek with grief was pale, with anger red; Out of her window close she blushing peeps; Her weeping eyes in pearled dew she steeps, Casting what sportlesse nights she ever led: She dying lives, to think he's living dead. Curst be, and cursed is that wretched sire, That yokes green youth with age, want with desire. Who ties the sunne to snow? or marries frost to fire? 2 The morn saluting, up I quickly rise, And to the green I poste; for on this day Shepherd and fisher-boyes had set a prize, Upon the shore to meet in gentle fray, Which of the two should sing the choicest lay; Daphnis the shepherds lad, whom Mira's eys Had kill'd; yet with such wound he gladly dies: Thomalin the fisher, in whose heart did reigne Stella; whose love his life, and whose disdain Seems worse then angry skies, or never quiet main. 3 There soon I view the merry shepherd-swains March three by three, clad all in youthfull green: And while the sad recorder sweetly plains, Three lovely Nymphs (each several row between, More lovely Nymphs could no where els be seen, Whose faces snow their snowy garments stains) With sweeter voices fit their pleasing strains. Their flocks flock round about; the horned rammes, And ewes go silent by, while wanton lambes Dancing along the plains, forget their milky dammes. 4 Scarce were the shepherds set, but straight in sight The fisher-boyes came driving up the stream; Themselves in blue, and twenty sea-nymphs bright In curious robes, that well the waves might seem: All dark below, the top like frothy cream: Their boats and masts with flowres, and garlands dight; And round the swannes guard them with armies white: Their skiffes by couples dance to sweetest sounds, Which running cornets breath to full plain grounds, That strikes the rivers face, and thence more sweet rebounds. 5 And now the Nymphs and swains had took their place; First those two boyes; Thomalin the fishers pride, Daphnis the shepherds: Nymphs their right hand grace; And choicest swains shut up the other side: So sit they down in order fit appli'd; Thirsil betwixt them both, in middle space: (Thirsil their judge, who now's a shepherd base, But late a fisher-swain, till envious Chame Had rent his nets, and sunk his boat with shame; So robb'd the boyes of him, and him of all his game). 6 So as they sit, thus Thirsil 'gins the lay; Thirsil. You lovely boyes, (the woods, and Oceans pride) Since I am judge of this sweet peacefull fray, First tell us, where, and when your Loves you spied: And when in long discourse you well are tried, Then in short verse by turns we'l gently play: In love begin, in love we'l end the day. Daphnis, thou first; to me you both are deare: Ah, if I might, I would not judge, but heare: Nought have I of a judge, but an impartiall eare. Daph. PhÅbus, if as thy words, thy oaths are true; Give me that verse which to the honour'd bay (That verse which by thy promise now is due) To honour'd Daphne in a sweet tun'd lay (Daphne thy chang'd, thy love unchanged aye) Thou sangest late, when she now better staid, More humane when a tree, then when a maid, Bending her head, thy love with gentle signe repaid. 8 What tongue, what thought can paint my Loves perfection? So sweet hath nature pourtray'd every part, That art will prove that artists imperfection, Who, when no eye dare view, dares limme her face. PhÅbus, in vain I call thy help to blaze More light then thine, a light that never fell: Thou tell'st what's done in heav'n, in earth, and hell: Her worth thou mayst admire; there are no words to tell. 9 She is like thee, or thou art like her, rather: Such as her hair, thy beams; thy single light, As her twin-sunnes: that creature then, I gather, Twice heav'nly is, where two sunnes shine so bright: So thou, as she, confound'st the gazing sight: Thy absence is my night; her absence hell. Since then in all thy self she doth excell, What is beyond thy self, how canst thou hope to tell? 10 First her I saw, when tir'd with hunting toyl, In shady grove spent with the weary chace, Her naked breast lay open to the spoil; The crystal humour trickling down apace, Like ropes of pearl, her neck and breast enlace: The aire (my rivall aire) did coolly glide Through every part: such when my Love I spi'd, So soon I saw my Love, so soon I lov'd, and di'd. 11 Her face two colours paint; the first a flame, (Yet she all cold) a flame in rosie die, Which sweetly blushes like the mornings shame: The second snow, such as on Alps doth lie, And safely there the sunne doth bold defie: Yet this cold snow can kindle hot desire. Thou miracle; mar'l not, if I admire, How flame should coldly freez, and snow should burn as fire. 12 Her slender waste, her hand, that dainty breast, Her cheek, her forehead, eye, and flaming hair, And those hid beauties, which must sure be best, In vain to speak, when words will more impair: Of all the fairs she is the fairest fair. Cease then vain words; well may you shew affection, But not her worth: the minde her sweet perfection Admires: how should it then give the lame tongue direction? Thom. Unlesse thy words be flitting as thy wave, Proteus, that song into my breast inspire, With which the seas (when loud they rore and rave) Thou softly charm'st, and windes intestine ire (When 'gainst heav'n, earth, and seas they did conspire) Thou quiet laid'st: Proteus, thy song to heare, Seas listning stand, and windes to whistle fear; The lively Delphins dance, and brisly Seales give eare. 14 Stella, my starre-like love, my lovely starre: Her hair a lovely brown, her forehead high, And lovely fair; such her cheeks roses are: Lovely her lip, most lovely is her eye: And as in each of these all love doth lie; So thousand loves within her minde retiring, Kindle ten thousand loves with gentle firing. Ah let me love my Love, not live in loves admiring! 15 At Proteus feast, where many a goodly boy, And many a lovely lasse did lately meet; There first I found, there first I lost my joy: Her face mine eye, her voice mine eare did greet; While eare &amp; eye strove which should be most sweet, That face, or voice: but when my lips at last Saluted hers, those senses strove as fast, Which most those lips did please; the eye, eare, touch, or taste. 16 The eye sweares, never fairer lip was eyed; The eare with those sweet relishes delighted, Thinks them the spheares; the taste that nearer tried Their relish sweet, the soul to feast invited; The touch, with pressure soft more close united, Wisht ever there to dwell; and never cloyed, (While thus their joy too greedy they enjoyed) Enjoy'd not half their joy, by being overjoyed. 17 Her hair all dark more clear the white doth show, And with its night her faces morn commends: Her eye-brow black, like to an ebon bow; Which sporting Love upon her forehead bends, And thence his never-missing arrow sends. But most I wonder how that jetty ray, Which those two blackest sunnes do fair display, Should shine so bright, &amp; night should make so sweet a day. 18 So is my love an heav'n; her hair a night: Her shining forehead Dian's silver light: Her eyes the starres; their influence delight: Her voice the sphears; her cheek Aurora bright: Her breast the globes, where heav'ns path milkie-white Runnes 'twixt those hills: her hand (Arions touch) As much delights the eye, the eare as much. Such is my Love, that, but my Love, was never such. Thirsil. The earth her robe, the sea her swelling tide; The trees their leaves, the moon her divers face; The starres their courses, flowers their springing pride; Dayes change their length, the Sunne his daily race: Be constant when you love; Love loves not ranging: Change when you sing; Muses delight in changing. Daph. Pan loves the pine-tree; Jove the oak approves; High populars Alcides temples crown: PhÅbus, though in a tree, still Daphne loves, And hyacinths, though living now in ground: Shepherds, if you your selves would victours see, Girt then this head with PhÅbus flower and tree. Thom. Alcinous peares, Pomona apples bore: Bacchus the vine, the olive Pallas chose: Venus loves myrtils, myrtils love the shore: Venus Adonis loves, who freshly blowes, Yet breathes no more: weave, lads, with myrtils roses And bay, and hyacinth the garland loses. Daph. Mira, thine eyes are those twin-heav'nly powers, Which to the widowed earth new offspring bring: No marvel then, if still thy face so flowers, And cheeks with beauteous blossomes freshly spring: So is thy face a never-fading May: So is thine eye a never-falling day. Thom. Stella, thine eyes are those twin-brothers fair, Which tempests slake, and promise quiet seas: No marvel then if thy brown shadie hair, Like night, portend sweet rest and gentle ease. Thus is thine eye an ever-calming light: Thus is thy hair a lovers ne'r-spent night. Daph. If sleepy poppies yeeld to lilies white; If black to snowy lambes; if night to day; If Western shades to fair Aurora's light; Stella must yeeld to Mira's shining ray. In day we sport, in day we shepherds toy: The night, for wolves; the light, the shepherds joy. Thom. Who white-thorn equalls with the violet? What workman rest compares with painfull light? Who weares the glaring glasse, and scorns the jet? Day yeeld to her, that is both day and night. In night the fishers thrive, the workmen play; Love loves the night; night's lovers holy-day. Daph. Fly thou the seas, fly farre the dangerous shore: Mira, if thee the king of seas should spie, He'l think Medusa (sweeter then before) With fairer hair, and double fairer eye, Is chang'd again; and with thee ebbing low, In his deep courts again will never flow. Thom. Stella, avoid both PhÅbus eare, and eye: His musick he will scorn, if thee he heare: Thee Daphne, (if thy face by chance he spie) Daphne now fairer chang'd, he'l rashly sweare: And viewing thee, will later rise and fall; Or viewing thee, will never rise at all. Daph. PhÅbus and Pan both strive my love to gain, And seek by gifts to winne my carelesse heart; Pan vows with lambes to fill the fruitfull plain; Apollo offers skill, and pleasing art: But Stella, if thou grant my suit, a kisse; PhÅbus and Pan their suit, my love, shall misse. Thom. Proteus himself, and Glaucus seek unto me; And twenty gifts to please my minde devise: Proteus with songs, Glaucus with fish doth woo me: Both strive to winne, but I them both despise: For if my Love my love will entertain, Proteus himself, and Glaucus seek in vain. Daph. Two twin, two spotted lambes, (my songs reward) With them a cup I got, where Jove assumed New shapes, to mock his wives too jealous guard; Full of Joves fires it burns still unconsumed: But Mira, if thou gently deigne to shine, Thine be the cup, the spotted lambes be thine. Thom. A pair of swannes are mine, and all their train; With them a cup, which Thetis self bestowed, As she of love did heare me sadly plain; A pearled cup, where Nectar oft hath flowed: But if my Love will love the gift, and giver; Thine be the cup, thine be the swannes for ever. Daph. Thrice happy swains! thrice happy shepherds fate! Thom. Ah blessed life! ah blessed fishers state! Your pipes asswage your love; your nets maintain you. Daph. Your lambkins clothe you warm; your flocks sustain you: You fear no stormie seas, nor tempests roaring. Thom. You sit not rots or burning starres deploring: In calms you fish; in roughs use songs and dances. Daph. More do you fear your Loves sweet-bitter glances, Then certain fate, or fortune ever changing. Thom. Ah that the life in seas so safely ranging, Should with loves weeping eye be sunk, and drown'd! Daph. The shepherds life PhÅbus a shepherd crown'd, His snowy flocks by stately Peneus leading. Thom. What herb was that, on which old Glaucus feeding, Grows never old, but now the gods augmenteth? Daph. Delia her self her rigour hard relenteth: To play with shepherds boy she's not ashamed. Thom Venus, of frothy seas thou first wast framed; The waves thy cradle: now Love's Queen art named. Daph. Thou gentle boy, what prize may well reward thee? So slender gift as this not half requites thee. May prosperous starres, and quiet seas regard thee; But most, that pleasing starre that most delights thee: May Proteus still and Glaucus dearest hold thee; But most, her influence all safe infold thee: May she with gentle beams from her fair sphear behold thee. Thom. As whistling windes 'gainst rocks their voices tearing; As rivers through the valleys softly gliding; As haven after cruel tempests fearing: Such, fairest boy, such is thy verses sliding. Thine be the prize: may Pan and PhÅbus grace thee; Most, whom thou most admir'st, may she embrace thee; And flaming in thy love, with snowy arms enlace thee. Thirsil. You lovely boyes, full well your art you guided; That with your striving songs your strife is ended: So you your selves the cause have well decided; And by no judge can your award be mended. Then since the prize for onely one intended You both refuse, we justly may reserve it, And as your offering in Love's temple serve it; Since none of both deserve, when both so well deserve it. 36 Yet, for such songs should ever be rewarded; Daphnis, take thou this hook of ivory clearest, Giv'n me by Pan, when Pan my verse regarded: This fears the wolf, when most the wolf thou fearest. But thou, my Thomalin, my love, my dearest, Take thou this pipe, which oft proud storms restrained; Which, spite of Chamus spite, I still retained: Was never little pipe more soft, more sweetly plained. 37 And you, fair troop, if Thirsil you disdain not, Vouchsafe with me to take some short refection: Excesse, or daints my lowly roofs maintain not; Peares, apples, plummes, no sugred made confection. So up they rose, and by Love's sweet direction Sea-nymphs with shepherds sort: sea-boyes complain not That wood-nymphs with like love them entertain not. And all the day to songs and dances lending, Too swift it runnes, and spends too fast in spending. With day their sports began, with day they take their ending. FINIS. POETICALL MISCELLANIES. An Hymen at the Marriage of my most deare Cousins Mr. W. and M. R. Chamus, that with thy yellow-sanded stream Slid'st softly down where thousand Muses dwell, Gracing their bowres, but thou more grac'd by them; Heark Chamus, from thy low-built greeny cell; Heark, how our Kentish woods with Hymen ring, While all the Nymphs, and all the shepherds sing, Hymen, oh Hymen, here thy saffron garment bring. With him a shoal of goodly shepherd-swains; Yet he more goodly then the goodliest swain: With her a troop of fairest wood-nymphs trains; Yet she more fair then fairest of the train: And all in course their voice attempering, While the woods back their bounding Echo fling, Hymen, come holy Hymen; Hymen lowd they sing. His high-built forehead almost maiden fair, Hath made an hundred Nymphs her chance envying: Her more then silver skin, and golden hair, Cause of a thousand shepherds forced dying. Where better could her love then here have nested? Or he his thoughts more daintily have feasted? Hymen, come Hymen; here thy saffron coat is rested. His looks resembling humble Majesty, Rightly his fairest mothers grace befitteth: In her face blushing, fearfull modesty, The Queens of chastity and beauty, sitteth: There cheerfulnesse all sadnesse farre exileth: Here love with bow unbent all gently smileth. Hymen come, Hymen come; no spot thy garment 'fileth. Love's bow in his bent eye-brows bended lies, And in his eyes a thousand darts of loving: Her shining starres, which (fools) we oft call eyes, As quick as heav'n it self in speedy moving; And this in both the onely difference being, Other starres blinde, these starres indu'd with seeing. Hymen, come Hymen; all is for thy rites agreeing. His breast a shelf of purest alabaster, Where Love's self sailing often shipwrackt sitteth: Hers a twin-rock, unknown but to th'ship-master; Which though him safe receives, all other splitteth: Both Love's high-way, yet by Love's self unbeaten, Most like the milky path which crosses heaven. Hymen, come Hymen; all their marriage joyes are even. And yet all these but as gilt covers be; Within, a book more fair we written finde: For Nature, framing th' Alls epitome, Set in the face the Index of the minde. Their bodies are but Temples, built for state, To shrine the Graces in their silver plate: Come Hymen, Hymen come, these Temples consecrate. Hymen, the tier of hearts already tied; Hymen, the end of lovers never ending; Hymen, the cause of joyes, joyes never tried; Joyes never to be spent, yet ever spending: Hymen, that sow'st with men the desert sands; Come, bring with thee, come bring thy sacred bands: Hymen, come Hymen, th' hearts are joyn'd, joyn thou the hands. Warrant of lovers, the true seal of loving, Sign'd with the face of joy; the holy knot, That bindes two hearts, and holds from slippery moving; A gainfull losse, a stain without a blot; That mak'st one soul as two, and two as one; Yoke lightning burdens; love's foundation: Hymen, come Hymen, now untie the maiden zone. Thou that mad'st Man a brief of all thou mad'st, A little living world, and mad'st him twain, Dividing him whom first thou one creat'st, And by this bond mad'st one of two again, Bidding her cleave to him, and him to her, And leave their parents, when no parents were: Hymen, send Hymen from thy sacred bosome here. See where he goes, how all the troop he cheereth, Clad with a saffron coat, in's hand a light; In all his brow not one sad cloud appeareth: His coat all pure, his torch all burning bright. Now chant we Hymen, shepherds; Hymen sing: See where he goes, as fresh as is the Spring. Hymen, oh Hymen, Hymen, all the valleys ring. Oh happy pair, where nothing wants to either, Both having to content, and be contented; Fortune and nature being spare to neither! Ne're may this bond of holy love be rented, But like two parallels, run a level race, In just proportion, and in even space. Hymen, thus Hymen will their spotlesse marriage grace. Live each of other firmly lov'd, and loving; As farre from hate, as self-ill, jealousie: Moving like heav'n still in the self same moving; In motion ne're forgetting constancy. Be all your dayes as this; no cause to plain: Free from satiety, or (but lovers) pain. Hymen, so Hymen still their present joyes maintain. To my beloved Cousin W. R. Esquire. Calend. Januar. Cousin, day-birds are silenc't, and those fowl Yet onely sing, which hate warm PhÅbus light; Th' unlucky Parrat, and death-boding Owl, Which ush'ring in to heav'n their mistresse Night, Hollow their mates, triumphing o're the quick-spent light. The wronged Philomel hath left to plain Tereus constraint and cruel ravishment: Seems the poore bird hath lost her tongue again. Progne long since is gone to banishment; And the loud-tuned Thrush leaves all her merriment. All so my frozen Muse, hid in my breast, To come into the open aire refuses; And dragg'd at length from hence, doth oft protest, This is no time for PhÅbus-loving Muses; When the farre-distant sunne our frozen coast disuses. Then till the sunne, which yet in fishes hasks, Or watry urn, impounds his fainting head, 'Twixt Taurus horns his warmer beam unmasks, And sooner rises, later goes to bed; Calling back all the flowers, now to their mother fled: Till Philomel resumes her tongue again, And Progne fierce returns from long exiling; Till the shrill Blackbird chants his merry vein; And the day-birds the long-liv'd sunne beguiling, Renew their mirth, and the yeares pleasant smiling: Here must I stay, in sullen study pent, Among our Cambridge fennes my time misspending; But then revisit our long-long'd-for Kent. Till then live happy, the time ever mending: Happy the first o' th' yeare, thrice happy be the ending. To Master W. C. Willy my deare, that late by Haddam sitting, By little Haddam, in those private shades, Unto thy fancie thousand pleasures fitting, With dainty Nymphs in those retired glades, Didst spend thy time; (time that too quickly fades) Ah! much I fear, that those so pleasing toyes Have too much lull'd thy sense and minde in slumbring joyes. Now art thou come to nearer Maddingly, Which with fresh sport and pleasure doth enthrall thee; There new delights withdraw thy eare, thy eye; Too much I fear, lest some ill chance befall thee: Heark, how the Cambridge Muses thence recall thee; Willy our deare, Willy his time abuses: But sure thou hast forgot our Chame, and Cambridge Muses. Return now, Willy; now at length return thee: Here thou and I, under the sprouting vine, By yellow Chame, where no hot ray shall burn thee, Will sit, and sing among the Muses nine; And safely cover'd from the scalding shine, We'l read that Mantuan shepherds sweet complaining Whom fair Alexis griev'd with his unjust disdaining: And when we list to lower notes descend, Heare Thirsil's moan, and Fusca's crueltie: He cares not now his ragged flock to tend; Fusca his care, but carelesse enemie: Hope oft he sees shine in her humble eye; But soon her angrie words of hope deprives him: So often dies with love, but love as oft revives him. To my ever honoured Cousin W. R. Esquire. Strange power of home, with how strong-twisted arms And Gordian-twined knot dost thou enchain me! Never might fair Calisto's doubled charms, Nor powerfull Circe's whispring so detain me, Though all her art she spent to entertain me; Their presence could not force a weak desire: But (oh!) thy powerfull absence breeds still-growing fire. By night thou try'st with strong imagination To force my sense 'gainst reason to belie it: Me thinks I see the fast-imprinted fashion Of every place, and now I fully eye it; And though with fear, yet cannot well denie it, Till the morn bell awakes me; then for spite I shut mine eyes again, and wish back such a night. But in the day, my never-slak't desire Will cast to prove by welcome forgerie, That for my absence I am much the nigher; Seeking to please with soothing flatterie. Love's wing is thought; and thought will soonest fly, Where it findes want: then as our love is dearer, Absence yeelds presence; distance makes us nearer. Ah! might I in some humble Kentish dale For ever eas'ly spend my slow-pac't houres; Much should I scorn fair Ãton's pleasant vale, Or Windsor Tempe's self, and proudest towers: There would I sit safe from the stormie showers, And laugh the troublous windes, and angrie skie. Piping (ah!) might I live, and piping might I die! And would my luckie fortune so much grace me, As in low Cranebrook, or high Brenchly's hill, Or in some cabin neare thy dwelling place me, There would I gladly sport, and sing my fill, And teach my tender Muse to raise her quill; And that high Mantuan shepherd self to dare; If ought with that high Mantuan shepherd mought compare. There would I chant either thy Gemma's praise, Or els my Fusca; (fairest shepherdesse) Or when me list my slender pipe to raise, Sing of Eliza's fixed mournfulnesse, And much bewail such wofull heavinesse; Whil'st she a dear-lov'd Hart (ah lucklesse!) slew: Whose fall she all too late, too soon, too much, did rue. But seeing now I am not as I would, But here among th'unhonour'd willows shade, The muddy Chame doth me enforced hold; Here I forsweare my merry piping trade: My little pipe of seven reeds ymade (Ah pleasing pipe!) I'le hang upon this bough. Thou Chame, and Chamish Nymphs, bear witnesse of my vow. To E. C. in Cambridge, my sonne by the University. When first my minde call'd it self in to think, There fell a strife not easie for to end; Which name should first crown the white papers brink, An awing father, or an equall friend: Fortune gives choice of either to my minde; Both bonds to tie the soul, it never move; That of commanding, this of easie love. The lines of love, which from a fathers heart Are draw'n down to the sonne; and from the sonne Ascend to th' father, draw'n from every part, Each other cut, and from the first transition Still further wander with more wide partition: But friends, like parallels, runne a level race, In just proportion, and most even space. Then since a double choice, double affection Hath plac't it self in my twice-loving breast; No title then can adde to this perfection, Nor better that, which is alreadie best: So naming one, I must implie the rest; The same a father, and a friend; or rather, Both one; a father-friend, and a friend-father. No marvel then the difference of the place Makes in my minde at all no difference: For love is not produc'd or penn'd in space, Having i' th' soul his onely residence. Love's fire is thought; and thought is never thence, Where it feels want: then where a love is deare, The minde in farthest distance is most neare. Me Kent holds fast with thousand sweet embraces; (There mought I die with thee, there with thee live!) All in the shades, the Nymphs and naked Graces Fresh joyes and still-succeeding pleasures give; So much we sport, we have no time to grieve: Here do we sit, and laugh white-headed caring; And know no sorrow simple pleasures marring. A crown of wood-nymphs spread i' th' grassie plain Sit round about, no niggards of their faces; Nor do they cloud their fair with black disdain; All to my self will they impart their graces: Ah! not such joyes finde I in other places: To them I often pipe, and often sing, Sweet notes to sweeter voices tempering. And now but late I sang the Hymen toyes Of two fair lovers, (fairer were there never) That in one bed coupled their spousall joyes; Fortune and Nature being scant to neither: What other dare not wish, was full in either. Thrice happie bed, thrice happie lovers firing, Where present blessings have out-stript desiring! And when me list to sadder tunes apply me, Pasilia's dirge, and Eupathus complaining; And often while my pipe lies idle by me, Read Fusca's deep disdain, and Thirsil's plaining; Yet in that face is no room for disdaining; Where cheerfull kindnesse smiles in either eye, And beauty still kisses humilitie. Then do not marvel Kentish strong delights Stealing the time, do here so long detain me: Not powerfull Circe with her Hecate rites, Nor pleasing Lotos thus could entertain me, As Kentish powerfull pleasures here enchain me. Mean time, the Nymphs that in our Brenchly use, Kindly salute your busy Cambridge Muse. To my beloved Thenot in answer of his verse. Thenot my deare, how can a lofty hill To lowly shepherds thoughts be rightly fitting? An humble dale well fits with humble quill: There may I safely sing, all fearlesse sitting, My Fusca's eyes, my Fusca's beauty dittying; My loved lonenesse, and hid Muse enjoying: Yet should'st thou come, and see our simple toying, Well would fair Thenot like our sweet retired joying. But if my Thenot love my humble vein, (Too lowly vein) ne're let him Colin call me; He, while he was, was (ah!) the choicest swain, That ever grac'd a reed: what e're befall me, Or Myrtil, (so'fore Fusca fair did thrall me, Most was I know'n) or now poore Thirsil name me, Thirsil, for so my Fusca pleases frame me: But never mounting Colin; Colin's high stile will shame me. Two shepherds I adore with humble love; Th' high-towring swain, that by slow Mincius waves His well-grown wings at first did lowly prove, Where Corydon's sick love full sweetly raves; But after sung bold Turnus daring braves: And next our nearer Colin's sweetest strain; Most, where he most his Rosalind doth plain. Well may I after look, but follow all in vain. Why then speaks Thenot of the honour'd Bay? Apollo's self, though fain, could not obtain her; She at his melting songs would scorn to stay, Though all his art he spent to entertain her: Wilde beasts he tam'd, yet never could detain her. Then sit we here within this willow glade: Here for my Thenot I a garland made With purple violets, and lovely myrtil shade. Upon the picture of Achmat the Turkish tyrant. Such Achmat is, the Turks great Emperour, Third sonne to Mahomet, whose youthly spring But now with blossom'd cheek begins to flowre; Out of his face you well may read a King: Which who will throughly view, will eas'ly finde A perfect Index to his haughty minde. Within his breast, as in a palace, lie Wakefull ambition leagu'd with hastie pride; Fiercenesse alli'd with Turkish Majestie; Rests hate, in which his father living dy'd: Deep in his heart such Turkish vertue lies, And thus looks through the window of his eyes. His pleasure (farre from pleasure) is to see His navie spread her wings unto the winde: In stead of gold, arms fill his treasurie, Which (numberlesse) fill not his greedie minde. The sad Hungarian fears his tried might; And waning Persia trembles at his sight. His greener youth, most with the heathen spent, Gives Christian Princes justest cause to fear His riper age, whose childhood thus is bent. A thousand trophies will he shortly rear, Unlesse that God, who gave him first this rage, Binde his proud head in humble vassalage. To Mr. Jo. Tomkins. Thomalin my lief, thy musick strains to heare, More raps my soul, then when the swelling windes On craggie rocks their whistling voices tear; Or when the sea, if stopt his course he findes, With broken murmures thinks weak shores to fear, Scorning such sandie cords his proud head bindes: More then where rivers in the summers ray (Through covert glades cutting their shadie way) Run tumbling down the lawns, &amp; with the pebles play. Thy strains to heare, old Chamus from his cell Comes guarded with an hundred Nymphs around; An hundred Nymphs, that in his rivers dwell, About him flock with water-lilies crown'd: For thee the Muses leave their silver well, And marvel where thou all their art hast found: There sitting they admire thy dainty strains, And while thy sadder accent sweetly plains, Feel thousand sugred joyes creep in their melting veins. How oft have I, the Muses bower frequenting, Miss'd them at home, and found them all with thee! Whether thou sing'st sad Eupathus lamenting, Or tunest notes to sacred harmonie, The ravisht soul, with thy sweet songs consenting, Scorning the earth, in heav'nly extasie Transcends the starres, and with the angels train Those courts survaies; and now come back again, Findes yet another heav'n in thy delightfull strain. Ah! could'st thou here thy humble minde content Lowly with me to live in countrey cell, And learn suspect the courts proud blandishment; Here might we safe, here might we sweetly dwell. Live Pallas in her towers and marble tent; But (ah!) the countrey bowers please me as well: There with my Thomalin I safe would sing, And frame sweet ditties to thy sweeter string: There would we laugh at spite and fortunes thundering. No flattery, hate, or envy lodgeth there; There no suspicion wall'd in proved steel, Yet fearfull of the arms her self doth wear: Pride is not there; no tyrant there we feel; No clamorous laws shall deaf thy musick eare: They know no change, nor wanton fortunes wheel: Thousand fresh sports grow in those daintie places: Light Fawns &amp; Nymphs dance in the woodie spaces, And little Love himself plaies with the naked Graces. But seeing fate my happie wish refuses, Let me alone enjoy my low estate. Of all the gifts that fair Parnassus uses, Onely scorn'd povertie, and fortunes hate Common I finde to me, and to the Muses: But with the Muses welcome poorest fate. Safe in my humble cottage will I rest; And lifting up from my untainted breast A quiet spirit to heav'n, securely live, and blest. To thee I here bequeath the courtly joyes, Seeing to court my Thomalin is bent: Take from thy Thirsil these his idle toyes; Here I will end my looser merriment: And when thou sing'st them to the wanton boyes, Among the courtly lasses blandishment, Think of thy Thirsil's love that never spends; And softly say, his love still better mends: Ah too unlike the love of court, or courtly friends! Go little pipe; for ever I must leave thee, My little little pipe, but sweetest ever: Go, go; for I have vow'd to see thee never, Never, (ah!) never must I more receive thee; But he in better love will still persever: Go little pipe, for I must have a new: Farewell ye Norfolk maids, and Ida crue: Thirsil will play no more; for ever now adieu. To Thomalin. Thomalin, since Thirsil nothing h[as] to leave thee, And leave thee must; pardon me (gentle friend) If nothing but my love I onely give thee; Yet see how great this Nothing is, I send: For though this love of thine I sweetest prove, Nothing's more sweet then is this sweetest love. The souldier Nothing like his prey esteems; Nothing toss'd sailers equal with the shore: Nothing before his health the sick man deems; The pilgrim hugges his countrey; Nothing more: The miser hoording up his golden wares, This Nothing with his precious wealth compares. Our thoughts ambition onely Nothing ends; Nothing fills up the golden-dropsied minde: The prodigall, that all so lavish spends, Yet Nothing cannot; Nothing stayes behinde: The King, that with his life a kingdome buyes, Then life or crown doth Nothing higher prize. Who all enjoyes, yet Nothing now desires; Nothing is greater then the highest Jove: Who dwells in heav'n, (then) Nothing more requires; Love, more then honey; Nothing more sweet then love: Nothing is onely better then the best; Nothing is sure: Nothing is ever blest. I love my health, my life, my books, my friends, Thee; (dearest Thomalin) Nothing above thee: For when my books, friends, health, life, fainting ends, When thy love fails, yet Nothing still will love me: When heav'n, and aire, the earth, and floating mains Are gone, yet Nothing still untoucht remains. Since then to other streams I must betake me, And spitefull Chame of all ha's quite bereft me; Since Muses selves (false Muses) will forsake me, And but this Nothing, nothing els is left me; Take thou my love, and keep it still in store: That given, Nothing now remaineth more. Against a rich man despising povertie. If well thou view'st us with no squinted eye, No partiall judgement, thou wilt quickly rate Thy wealth no richer then my povertie; My want no poorer then thy rich estate: Our ends and births alike; in this, as I; Poore thou wert born, and poore again shalt die. My little fills my little-wishing minde; Thou having more then much, yet seekest more: Who seeks, still wishes what he seeks, to finde; Who wishes, wants; and who so wants, is poore: Then this must follow of necessitie; Poore are thy riches, rich my povertie. Though still thou gett'st, yet is thy want not spent, But as thy wealth, so growes thy wealthy itch: But with my little I have much content; Content hath all; and who hath all, is rich: Then this in reason thou must needs confesse, If I have little, yet that thou hast lesse. What ever man possesses, God hath lent, And to his audit liable is ever, To reckon, how, and where, and when he spent: Then this thou bragg'st, thou art a great receiver: Little my debt, when little is my store: The more thou hast, thy debt still growes the more. But seeing God himself descended down T' enrich the poore by his rich povertie; His meat, his house, his grave, were not his own, Yet all is his from all eternitie: Let me be like my Head, whom I adore: Be thou great, wealthie, I still base and poore. Contemnenti. Continuall burning, yet no fire or fuel, Chill icie frosts in midst of summers frying, A hell most pleasing, and a heav'n most cruel, A death still living, and a life still dying, And whatsoever pains poore hearts can prove, I feel, and utter in one word, i love. Two fires, of love and grief, each upon either, And both upon one poore heart ever feeding; Chill cold despair, most cold, yet cooling neither, In midst of fires his ycie frosts is breeding: So fires and frosts, to make a perfect hell, Meet in one breast, in one house friendly dwell. Tir'd in this toylsome way (my deep affection) I ever forward runne, and never ease me: I dare not swerve, her eye is my direction: A heavie grief, and weighty love oppresse me. Desire and hope, two spurres, that forth compell'd me; But awfull fear, a bridle, still withheld me. Twice have I plung'd, and flung, and strove to cast This double burden from my weary heart: Fast though I runne, and stop, they sit as fast: Her looks my bait, which she doth seldâ impart. Thus fainting, still some inne I wish and crave; Either her maiden bosome, or my grave. A vow. By hope and fear, by grief and joy opprest, With deadly hate, more deadly love infected; Without, within, in body, soul, distrest; Little by all, least by my self respected, But most, most there, where most I lov'd, neglected; Hated, and hating life, to death I call; Who scorns to take what is refus'd by all. Whither, ah, whither then wilt thou betake thee, Despised wretch, of friends, of all forlorn, Since hope, and love, and life, and death forsake thee? Poore soul, thy own tormenter, others scorn! Whither, poore soul, ah, whither wilt thou turn? What inne, what host (scorn'd wretch) wilt thou now chuse thee? The common host, and inne, death, grave, refuse thee. To thee, great Love, to thee I prostrate fall, That right'st in love the heart in false love swerved: On thee, true Love, on thee I weeping call; I, who am scorn'd, where with all truth I served, On thee, so wrong'd, where thou hast so deserved: Disdain'd, where most I lov'd, to thee I plain me, Who truly lovest those, who (fools) disdain thee. Thou never-erring Way, in thee direct me; Thou Death of death, oh, in thy death engrave me: Thou hated Love, with thy firm love respect me; Thou freest Servant, from this yoke unslave me: Glorious Salvation, for thy glory save me. So neither love, nor hate, scorn, death, shall move me; But with thy love, great Love, I still shall love thee. On womens lightnesse. Who sowes the sand? or ploughs the easie shore? Or strives in nets to prison in the winde? Yet I, (fond I) more fond, and senselesse more, Thought in sure love a womans thoughts to binde. Fond, too fond thoughts, that thought in love to tie One more inconstant then inconstancie! Look as it is with some true April day, Whose various weather stores the world with flowers; The sunne his glorious beams doth fair display, Then rains, and shines again, and straight it lowres, And twenty changes in one houre doth prove; So, and more changing is a womans love. Or as the hairs which deck their wanton heads, Which loosely fly, and play with every winde, And with each blast turn round their golden threads; Such as their hair, such is their looser minde: The difference this, their hair is often bound; But never bonds a woman might impound. False is their flattering colour, false and fading; False is their flattering tongue; false every part: Their hair is forg'd, their silver foreheads shading; False are their eyes, but falsest is their heart: Then this in consequence must needs ensue; All must be false, when every part's untrue. Fond then my thoughts, which thought a thing so vain! Fond hopes, that anchour on so false a ground! Fond love, to love what could not love again! Fond heart, thus fir'd with love, in hope thus drown'd! Fond thoughts, fond heart, fond hope; but fondest I, To grasp the winde, and love inconstancie! A reply upon the fair M. S. A daintie maid, that drawes her double name From bitter sweetnesse, (with sweet bitternesse) Did late my skill and faulty verses blame, And to her loving friend did plain confesse, That I my former credit foul did shame, And might no more a poets name professe: The cause that with my verse she was offended, For womens levitie I discommended. Too true you said, that poet I was never, And I confesse it (fair) if that content ye, That then I playd the poet lesse then ever; Not, for of such a verse I now repent me, (Poets to feigne, and make fine lies endeavour) But I the truth, truth (ah!) too certain sent ye: Then that I am no poet I denie not; For when their lightnesse I condemne, I ly not. But if my verse had ly'd against my minde, And praised that which truth cannot approve, And falsly said, they were as fair as kinde, As true as sweet, their faith could never move, But sure is linkt where constant love they finde, That with sweet braving they vie truth and love; If thus I write, it cannot be deni'd But I a poet were, so foul I ly'd. But give me leave to write as I have found: Like ruddy apples are their outsides bright, Whose skin is fair, the core or heart unsound; Whose cherry-cheek the eye doth much delight, But inward rottennesse the taste doth wound: Ah! were the taste so good as is the sight, To pluck such apples (lost with self same price) Would back restore us part of paradise. But truth hath said it, (truth who dare denie?) Men seldome are, more seldome women sure: But if (fair-sweet) thy truth and constancie To better faith thy thoughts and minde procure, If thy firm truth could give firm truth the lie, If thy first love will first and last endure; Thou more then woman art, if time so proves thee, And he more then a man, that loved loves thee. An Apologie for the premises to the Ladie Culpepper. Who with a bridle strives to curb the waves? Or in a cypresse chest locks flaming fires? So when love angred in thy bosome raves, And grief with love a double flame inspires, By silence thou mayst adde, but never lesse it: The way is by expressing to represse it. Who then will blame affection not respected, To vent in grief the grief that so torments him? Passion will speak in passion, if neglected: Love that so soon will chide, as soon repents him; And therefore boyish Love's too like a boy, With a toy pleas'd, displeased with a toy. Have you not seen, when you have chid or fought, That lively picture of your lovely beauty, Your pretty childe, at first to lowre or pout, But soon again reclaim'd to love and duty; Forgets the rod, and all her anger ends, Playes on your lap, or on your neck depends: Too like that pretty childe is childish Love, That when in anger he is wrong'd, or beat, Will rave and chide, and every passion prove, But soon to smiles and fawns turns all his heat, And prayes, and swears he never more will do it; Such one is Love: alas that women know it! But if so just excuse will not content ye, But still you blame the words of angry Love; Here I recant, and of those words repent me: In signe hereof I offer now to prove, That changing womens love is constant ever, And men, though ever firm, are constant never. For men that to one fair their passions binde, Must ever change, as do those changing fairs; So as she alters, alters still their minde, And with their fading Loves their love impairs: Therefore still moving, as the fair they loved, Most do they move, by being most unmoved. But women, when their lovers change their graces, What first in them they lov'd, love now in others, Affecting still the same in divers places; So never change their love, but change their lovers: Therefore their minde is firm and constant prov'd, Seeing they ever love what first they lov'd. Their love ty'd to some vertue, cannot stray, Shifting the outside oft, the inside never: But men (when now their Loves dissolv'd to clay Indeed are nothing) still in love persever: How then can such fond men be constant made, That nothing love, or but a (nothing) shade? What fool commends a stone for never moving? Or blames the speedie heav'ns for ever ranging? Cease then, fond men, to blaze your constant loving; Love's firie, winged, light, and therefore changing: Fond man, that thinks such fire and aire to fetter! All change; men for the worse, women for better. To my onely chosen Valentine and wife, Maystress Elisabeth Vincent Is my brests chaste Valentine. (anagram) Think not (fair love) that Chance my hand directed To make my choice my chance; blinde Chance &amp; hands Could never see what most my minde affected; But heav'n (that ever with chaste true love stands) Lent eyes to see what most my heart respected: Then do not thou resist what heav'n commands; But yeeld thee his, who must be ever thine: My heart thy altar is, my breast thy shrine; Thy name for ever is, My brests chaste Valentine. A translation of BoÃ«thius, the third book and last verse. Happie man, whose perfect sight Views the over-flowing light! Happie man, that canst unbinde Th' earth-barres pounding up the minde! Once his wives quick fate lamenting Orpheus sat, his hair all renting, While the speedie woods came running, And rivers stood to heare his cunning; And the lion with the hart Joyn'd side to side to heare his art: Hares ran with the dogs along, Not from dogs, but to his song. But when all his verses turning Onely fann'd his poore hearts burning, And his grief came but the faster, (His verse all easing, but his master) Of the higher powers complaining, Down he went to hell disdaining: There his silver lute-strings hitting, And his potent verses fitting, All the sweets that e're he took From his sacred mothers brook, What his double sorrow gives him, And love, that doubly-double grieves him, There he spends to move deaf hell, Charming divels with his spell, And with sweetest asking leave Does the lords of ghosts deceive. The dog, whose never quiet yell Affrights sad souls in night that dwell, Pricks up now his thrice two eares; To howl, or bark, or whine he fears: Struck with dumbe wonder at those songs, He wisht more eares, and fewer tongues. Charon amaz'd his oare foreslowes, While the boat the sculler rowes. Tantal might have eaten now The fruit as still as is the bough; But he (fool!) no hunger fearing, Starv'd his taste, to feed his hearing. Ixion, though his wheel stood still, Still was rapt with musicks skill. At length the Judge of souls with pitie Yeelds, as conquer'd with his dittie; Let's give back his spouses herse, Purchas'd with so pleasing verse: Yet this law shall binde our gift, He turn not, till ha's Tartar left. Who to laws can lovers draw? Love in love is onely law: Now almost he left the night, When he first turn'd back his sight; And at once, while her he ey'd, His Love he saw, and lost, and dy'd. So, who strives out of the night To bring his soul to joy in light, Yet again turns back his eye To view left hells deformitie; Though he seems enlightned more, Yet is blacker then afore. A translation of BoÃ«thius, book 2 verse 7. Who onely honour seeks with prone affection, And thinks that glory is his greatest blisse; First let him view the heav'ns wide-stretched section, Then in some mappe the earths short narrownesse: Well may he blush to see his name not able To fill one quarter of so brief a table. Why then should high-grow'n mindes so much rejoyce To draw their stubborn necks from mans subjection? For though loud fame stretch high her pratling voice To blaze abroad their vertues great pe[r]fection; Though goodly titles of their house adorn them With ancient Heraldrie, yet death doth scorn them: The high and base lie in the self same grave; No difference there between a King and slave. Where now are true Fabricius bones remaining? Who knowes where Brutus, or rough Cato lives? Onely a weak report, their names sustaining, In records old a slender knowledge gives: Yet when we reade the deeds of men inhumed, Can we by that know them, long since consumed? Now therefore lie you buried and forgotten; Nor can report frustrate encroaching death: Or if you think when you are dead, and rotten, You live again by fame, and vulgar breath; When with times shadows this false glory wanes, You die again: but this your glorie gains. Upon my brother, Mr G. F. his book entituled Christs Victorie and Triumph. Fond lads, that spend so fast your posting time, (Too posting time, that spends your time as fast) To chant light toyes, or frame some wanton rhyme, Where idle boyes may glut their lustfull taste; Or else with praise to clothe some fleshly slime With virgin roses, and fair lilies chaste: While itching blouds, and youthfull eares adore it; But wiser men, and once your selves will most abhorre it. But thou, (most neare, most deare) in this of thine Hast prov'd the Muses not to Venus bound; Such as thy matter, such thy Muse, divine: Or thou such grace with Mercie's self hast found, That she her self deignes in thy leaves to shine; Or stoll'n from heav'n, thou brought'st this verse to ground, Which frights the nummed soul with fearfull thunder, And soon with honeyed dews thawes it 'twixt joy and wonder. Then do not thou malicious tongues esteem; (The glasse, through which an envious eye doth gaze, Can eas'ly make a mole-hill mountain seem) His praise dispraises; his dispraises praise; Enough, if best men best thy labours deem, And to the highest pitch thy merit raise; While all the Muses to thy song decree Victorious Triumph, Triumphant Victorie. Upon the B. of Exon. Doct. Hall his Meditations. Most wretched soul, that here carowsing pleasure, Hath all his heav'n on earth; and ne're distressed Enjoyes these fond delights without all measure, And freely living thus, is thus deceased! Ah greatest curse, so to be ever blessed! For where to live is heav'n, 'tis hell to die. Ah wretch, that here begins hells miserie! Most b[l]essed soul, that lifted up with wings Of faith and love, leaves this base habitation, And scorning sluggish earth, to heav'n up springs; On earth, yet still in heav'n by meditation; With the souls eye foreseeing th' heav'nly station: Then 'gins his life, when he's of life bereaven. Ah blessed soul, that here begins his heaven! Upon the Contemplations of the B. of Excester, given to the Ladie E. W. at New-yeares-tide. This little worlds two little starres are eyes; And he that all eyes framed, fram'd all others Downward to fall, but these to climbe the skies, There to acquaint them with their starrie brothers; Planets fixt in the head (their spheare of sense) Yet wandring still through heav'ns circumference, The Intellect being their Intelligence. Dull then that heavie soul, which ever bent On earth and earthly toyes, his heav'n neglects; Content with that which cannot give content: What thy foot scorning kicks, thy soul respects. Fond soul! thy eye will up to heav'n erect thee; Thou it direct'st, and must it now direct thee? Dull, heavie soul! thy scholar must correct thee. Thrice happie soul, that guided by thine eyes, Art mounted up unto that starrie nation; And leaving there thy sense, entrest the skies, Enshrin'd and sainted there by contemplation! Heav'n thou enjoy'st on earth, and now bereaven Of life, a new life to thy soul is given. Thrice happie soul, that hast a double heaven! That sacred hand, which to this yeare hath brought you Perfect your yeares, and with your yeares, his graces; And when his will unto his will hath wrought you, Conduct your soul unto those happie places, Where thousand joyes, and pleasures ever new, And blessings thicker then the morning dew With endlesse sweets rain on that heav'nly crue. These Asclepiads of Mr. H. S. translated and enlarged. NÃ¨ Verbum mihi sit mortua Litera, Nec Christi Meritum Gratia vanida; Sed Verbum fatuo sola Scientia, Et Christus misero sola Redemptio. Unletter'd Word, which never eare could heare; Unwritten Word, which never eye could see, Yet syllabled in flesh-spell'd character, That so to senses thou might'st subject be; Since thou in bread art stampt, in print art read, Let not thy print-stampt Word to me be dead. Thou all-contriving, all-deserving Spirit, Made flesh to die, that so thou might'st be mine, That thou in us, and we in thee might merit, We thine, thou ours; thou humane, we divine; Let not my dead lifes merit, my dead heart Forfeit so deare a purchas'd deaths desert. Thou Sunne of wisdome, knowledge infinite, Made folly to the wise, night to prophane; Be I thy Moon, oh let thy sacred light Increase to th' full, and never, never wane: Wise folly set in me, fond wisdome rise, Made me renounce my wisdome, to be wise. Thou Life eternall, purest blessednesse, Made mortal, wretched, sinne it self for me; Shew me my death, my sin, my wretchednesse, That I may flourish, shine, and live in thee: So I with praise shall sing thy life, deaths storie, O thou my Merit, Life, my Wisdome, Glorie. Certain of the royal Prophets Psalmes metaphrased. Psalm 42. [Look as an hart with sweat and bloud embrued] which agrees with the tune of Like the Hermite poore. Look as an hart with sweat and bloud embrued, Chas'd and embost, thirsts in the soil to be; So my poore soul with eager foes pursued, Looks, longs, O Lord, pines, pants, and faints for thee: When, O my God, when shall I come in place To see thy light, and view thy glorious face? I dine and sup with sighs, with grones and teares, While all thy foes mine eares with taunting load; Who now thy cries, who now thy prayer heares? Where is, say they, where is thy boasted God? My molten heart deep plung'd in sad despairs Runnes forth to thee in streams of teares and prayers. With grief I think on those sweet now past dayes, When to thy house my troops with joy I led: We sang, we danc'd, we chanted sacred layes; No men so haste to wine, no bride to bed. Why droop'st, my soul? why faint'st thou in my breast? Wait still with praise; his presence is thy rest. My famisht soul driv'n from thy sweetest word, (From Hermon hill, and Jordans swelling brook) To thee laments, sighs deep to thee, O Lord, To thee sends back her hungrie longing look: Flouds of thy wrath breed flouds of grief and fears; And flouds of grief breed flouds of plaints and teares. His early light with morn these clouds shall clear, These drearie clouds, and storms of sad despairs: Sure am I in the night his songs to heare, Sweet songs of joy, as well as he my prayers. I'le say, My God, why slight'st thou my distresse, While all my foes my wearie soul oppresse? My cruel foes both thee and me upbraid; They cut my heart, they vant that bitter word, Where is thy trust? where is thy hope? they said; Where is thy God? where is thy boasted Lord? Why droop'st, my soul? why faint'st thou in my breast? Wait still with praise; his presence is thy rest. Psal. 63. [O lord, before the morning] which may be sung, as The widow, or mock-widow. O lord, before the morning Gives heav'n warning To let out the day, My wakefull eyes Look for thy rise, And wait to let in thy joyfull ray. Lank hunger here peoples the desert cells, Here thirst fills up the emptie wells: How longs my flesh for that bread without leaven! How thirsts my soul for that wine of heaven! Such (oh!) to taste thy ravishing grace! Such in thy house to view thy glorious face! Thy love, thy light, thy faces Bright-shining graces, (Whose unchanged ray Knows nor morns dawn, Nor evenings wane) How farre surmount they lifes winter day! My heart to thy glorie tunes all his strings; My tongue thy praises cheerly sings: And till I slumber, and death shall undresse me, Thus will I sing, thus will I blesse thee. Fill me with love, oh fill me with praise; So shall I vent due thanks in joyfull layes. When night all eyes hath quenched, And thoughts lie drenched In silence and rest; Then will I all Thy waies recall, And look on thy light in darknesse best. When my poore soul wounded had lost the field, Thou wast my fort, thou wast my shield. Safe in thy trenches I boldly will vant me, There will I sing, there will I chant thee; There I'le triumph in thy banner of grace, My conqu'ring arms shall be thy arms embrace. My foes from deeps ascending, In rage transcending, Assaulting me sore, Into their hell Are headlong fell; There shall they lie, there howl, and roare: There let deserv'd torments their spirits tear; Feel they worst ills, and worse yet fear. But with his spouse thine anointed in pleasure Shall reigne, and joy past time or measure: There new delights, new pleasures still spring: Haste there, oh haste, my soul, to dance and sing. PSAL. 127. [If God build not the house, and lay] To the tune of that Psalme. If God build not the house, and lay The ground-work sure; who ever build, It cannot stand one stormie day: If God be not the cities shield, If he be not their barres and wall; In vain is watch-tower, men, and all. Though then thou wak'st when others rest, Though rising thou prevent'st the Sunne; Though with lean care thou daily feast, Thy labour's lost, and thou undone: But God his childe will feed and keep, And draw the curtains to his sleep. Though th' hast a wife fit, young, and fair, An heritage heirs to advance; Yet canst thou not command an heir; For heirs are Gods inheritance: He gives the seed, the bud, the bloom; He gives the harvest to the wombe. And look as arrows, by strong arm In a strong bow drawn to the head, Where they are meant, will surely harm, And if they hit, wound deep and dead; Children of youth are even so; As harmfull, deadly, to a foe. That man shall live in blisse and peace, Who fills his quiver with such shot: Whose garners swell with such increase, Terrour and shame assail him not; And though his foes deep hatred bear, Thus arm'd, he shall not need to fear. PSAL. 137. [Where Perah's flowers] To be sung as, See the building. Where Perah's flowers Perfume proud Babels bowers, And paint her wall; There we laid asteeping Our eyes in endlesse weeping, For Sions fall. Our feasts and songs we laid aside; On forlorn willows (By Perah's billows) We hung our harps, and mirth and joy defi'd, That Sions ruines should build foul Babels pride. Our conqu'rours vaunting With bitter scoffes and taunting, Thus proudly jest; Take down your harps, and string them, Recall your songs, &amp; sing them, For Sions feast. Were our harps well tun'd in every string, Our heart-strings broken, Throats drown'd, and soken With tears and sighs, how can we praise and sing The King of heav'n under an heathen king? In all my mourning, Jerusalem, thy burning If I forget; Forget thy running, My hand, and all thy cunning To th' harp to set: Let thy mouth, my tongue, be still thy grave; Lie there asleeping, For Sion weeping: Oh let mine eyes in tears thy office have; Nor rise, nor set, but in their brinie wave. Proud Edoms raging, Their hate with bloud asswaging, And vengefull sword, Their cursed joying In Sions walls destroying Remember, Lord: Forget not, Lord, their spightfull cry, Fire and deface it, Destroy and raze it; Oh let the name of Sion ever die: Thus did they roare, and us and thee defie. So shall thy towers And all thy princely bowers, Proud Babel, fall: Him ever blessed, Who th' oppressour hath oppressed, Shall all men call: Thrice blest, that turns thy mirth to grones; That burns to ashes Thy towers, and dashes Thy brats 'gainst rocks, to wash thy bloudie stones With thine own bloud, and pave thee with thy bones. PSAL. 1. [Blessed, who walk'st not in the worldlings way] Blessed, who walk'st not in the worldlings way; Blessed, who with foul sinners wilt not stand: Blessed, who with proud mockers dar'st not stay; Nor sit thee down amongst that scornfull band. Thrice blessed man, who in that heav'nly light Walk'st, stand'st, and sitt'st, rejoycing day and night. Look as a thirstie Palm full Jordan drinks, (Whose leaf and fruit still live, when winter dies) With conqu'ring branches crowns the rivers brinks; And summers fires, and winters frosts defies: All so the soul, whom that clear light revives, Still springs, buds, grows, and dying time survives. But as the dust of chaffe, cast in the aire, Sinks in the dirt, and turns to dung and mire; So sinners driv'n to hell by fierce despair, Shall frie in ice, and freez in hellish fire: For he, whose flaming eyes all actions turn, Sees both; to light the one, the other burn. PSAL. 130. [From the deeps of grief and fear] From the deeps of grief and fear, O Lord, to thee my soul repairs: From thy heav'n bow down thine eare; Let thy mercie meet my prayers. Oh if thou mark'st what's done amisse, What soul so pure, can see thy blisse? But with thee sweet mercie stands, Sealing pardons, working fear: Wait my soul, wait on his hands; Wait mine eye, oh wait mine eare: If he his eye or tongue affords, Watch all his looks, catch all his words. As a watchman waits for day, And looks for light, and looks again; When the night grows old and gray, To be reliev'd he calls amain: So look, so wait, so long mine eyes, To see my Lord, my Sunne, arise. Wait ye saints, wait on our Lord; For from his tongue sweet mercie flows: Wait on his crosse, wait on his word; Upon that tree redemption grows: He will redeem his Israel From sinne and wrath, from death and hell. AN HYMNE. Wake, O my soul; awake, and raise Up every part to sing his praise, Who from his spheare of glorie fell, To raise thee up from death and hell: See how his soul, vext for thy sinne, Weeps bloud without, feels hell within: See where he hangs; heark how he cries: Oh bitter pangs! Now, now he dies. Wake, O mine eyes; awake, and view Those two twin-lights, whence heavens drew Their glorious beams, whose gracious sight Fills you with joy, with life, and light: See how with clouds of sorrow drown'd, They wash with tears thy sinfull wound; See how with streams of spit th' are drencht; See how their beams with death are quencht. Wake, O mine eare; awake, and heare That powerfull voice, which stills thy fear, And brings from heav'n those joyfull news, Which heav'n commands, which hell subdues; Heark how his eares (heav'ns mercie-seat) Foul slanders with reproaches beat: Heark how the knocks our eares resound; Heark how their mocks his hearing wound. Wake O my heart; tune every string: Wake O my tongue; awake, and sing: Think not a thought in all thy layes, Speak not a word, but of his praise: Tell how his sweetest tongue they drownd With gall; think how his heart they wound: That bloudie spout gagg'd for thy sinne, His life lets out, thy death lets in. AN HYMNE. Drop, drop, slow tears, and bathe those beauteous feet, Which brought from heav'n the news and Prince of peace: Cease not, wet eyes, his mercies to intreat; To crie for vengeance sinne doth never cease: In your deep flouds drown all my faults and fears; Nor let his eye see sinne, but through my tears. On my friends picture, who died in travel. Though now to heav'n thy travels are confin'd, Thy wealth, friends, life, and countrey, all are lost; Yet in this picture we thee living finde; And thou with lesser travel, lesser cost, Hast found new life, friends, wealth, and better coast: So by thy death thou liv'st, by losse thou gain'st, And in thy absence present still remain'st. Upon Doctor Playfer. Who lives with death, by death in death is lying; But he who living dies, best lives by dying: Who life to truth, who death to errour gives, In life may die, by death more surely lives. My soul in heaven breathes, in schools my fame: Then on my tombe write nothing but my name. Upon my brothers book called, The grounds, labour, and reward of faith. This lamp fill'd up, and fir'd by that blest Spirit, Spent his last oyl in this pure heav'nly flame; Laying the grounds, walls, roof of faith: this frame With life he ends; and now doth there inherit What here he built, crown'd with his laurel merit: Whose palms and triumphs once he loudly rang, There now enjoyes what here he sweetly sang. This is his monument, on which he drew His spirits image, that can never die; But breathes in these 'live words, and speaks to th' eye: In these his winding-sheets he dead doth shew To buried souls the way to live anew, And in his grave more powerfully now preacheth. Who will not learn, when that a dead man teacheth? Upon Mr. Perkins his printed sermons. Perkins (our wonder) living, though long dead, In this white paper, as a winding-sheet, And in this velome lies enveloped: Yet still he lives, guiding the erring feet, Speaking now to our eyes, though buried. If once so well, much better now he teacheth. Who will not heare, when a live-dead man preacheth? FINIS. ELISA,OR AN ELEGIE UPON THE UNRIPE DECEASE OF S? ANTOINE IRBY: Composed at the request (and for a monument) of his surviving Ladie. Anagramma Antonius Irbeus An virtus obiens? Esto mei mortisque memor. Funus virtuti fÅnus. To the right worthy Knight, Sr. ANTONIE IRBY. ELISA. [CANT. I.] 1 Look as a stagge, pierc'd with a fatal bow, (As by a wood he walks securely feeding) In coverts thick conceales his deadly blow, And feeling death swim in his endles bleeding, (His heavy head his fainting strength exceeding) Bids woods adieu, so sinks into his grave; Green brakes and primrose sweet his seemly herse embrave: 2 So lay a gentle Knight now full of death, With clowdie eyes his latest houre expecting; And by his side, sucking his fleeting breath, His weeping Spouse Elisa; life neglecting, And all her beauteous faires with grief infecting: Her cheek as pale as his; 'twere hard to scanne, If death or sorrows face did look more pale or wanne. 3 Close by, her sister, fair Alicia, sits; Fairest Alicia, to whose sweetest graces His teares and sighs a fellow passion fits: Upon her eye (his throne) Love sorrow places; There Comfort Sadnesse, Beautie Grief embraces: Pitie might seem a while that face to borrow, And thither now was come to comfort death &amp; sorrow. 4 At length lowd Grief thus with a fearfull shriek (His trumpet) sounds a battell, joy defying; Spreading his colours in Elisa's cheek, And from her eyes (his watch-tower) farre espying With Hope Delight, and Joy, and Comfort flying, Thus with her tongue their coward flight pursues, While sighs, shrieks, tears give chace with never fainting crues: 5 Thou traitour Joy, that in prosperitie So lowdly vaunt'st; whither, ah, whither fliest? And thou that bragg'st never from life to flie, False Hope, ah whither now so speedy hiest? In vain thy winged feet so fast thou pliest: Hope, thou art dead, and Joy in Hope relying Bleeds in his hopelesse wounds, and in his death lies dying. 6 But then Alicia (in whose cheerfull eye Comfort with Grief, Hope with Compassion lived) Renews the fight; If Joy and Comfort die, The fault is yours: so much (too much) you grieved, That Hope could never hope to be relieved. If all your hopes to one poore hope you binde, No marvel if one fled, not one remains behinde. 7 Fond hopes on life, so weak a threed, depending! Weak, as the threed such knots so weakly tying: But heav'nly joyes are circular, ne're ending, Sure as the rock on which they grow; and lying In heav'n, increase by losse, live best by dying. Then let your hope on those sure joyes depend, Which live &amp; grow by death, &amp; waste not when they spend. 8 Then she; Great Lord, thy judgements righteous be, To make good ill, when to our ill we use it: Good leads us to the greatest good, to Thee; But we to other ends most fond abuse it; A common fault, yet cannot that excuse it: We love thy gifts, and take them gladly ever: We love them (ah too much!) more then we love the giver. 9 So falling low upon her humbled knees, And all her heart within her eye expressing; 'Tis true, great Mercy, onely miseries Teach us our selves, and thee: oh, if confessing Our faults to thee be all our faults releasing, But in thine eare, I never sought to hide them: Ah! thou hast heard them oft, as oft as thou hast ey'd them. 10 I know the heart knows more then tongue can tell; But thou perceiv'st the heart his foulnesse telling: Yet knows the heart not half, so wide an hell, Such seas of sinne in such scant banks are swelling: Who sees all faults within his bosome dwelling? Many my tenants are, and I not know them. Most dangerous the wounds thou feel'st, and canst not show them. 11 Some hidden fault, my Father, and my God, Some fault I know not yet, nor yet amended, Hath forc't thee frown, and use thy smarting rod; Some grievous fault thee grievously offended: But let thy wrath, (ah!) let it now be ended. Father, this childish plea (if once I know it) Let stay thy threatning hand, I never more will do it. 12 If to my heart thou shew this hidden sore, Spare me; no more, no more I will offend thee; I dare not say I will, I would no more: Say thou I shall, and soon I will amend me. Then smooth thy brow, and now some comfort lend me; Oh let thy softest mercies rest contented: Though late, I most repent, that I so late repented. 13 Lay down thy rod, and stay thy smarting hand; These raining eyes into thy bottle gather: Oh see thy bleeding Sonne betwixt us stand; Remember me a childe, thy self a father: Or if thou mayst not stay, oh punish rather The part offending, this rebellious heart. Why pardon'st thou the worse, and plagu'st my better part? 14 Was't not thy hand, that ty'd the sacred knot? Was't not thy hand, that to my hand did give him? Hast thou not made us one? command'st thou not, None loose what thou hast bound? if then thou reave him, How without me by halves dost thou receive him! Tak'st thou the head, and leav'st the heart behinde? Ay me! in me alone canst thou such monster finde? 15 Oh why dost thou so strong me weak assail? Woman of all thy creatures is the weakest, And in her greatest strength did weakly fail: Thou who the weak and bruised never breakest, Who never triumph in the yeelding seekest; Pitie my weak estate, and leave me never: I ever yet was weak, and now more weak then ever. 16 With that her fainting spouse lifts up his head, And with some joy his inward griefs refraining, Thus with a feeble voice, yet cheerfull, s'ed; Spend not in tears this little time remaining; Thy grief doth adde to mine, not ease my paining: My death is life; such is the scourge of God: Ah, if his rods be such, who would not kisse his rod? 17 My deare, (once all my joy, now all my care) To these my words (these my last words) apply thee: Give me thy hand; these my last greetings are: Shew me thy face, I never more shall eye thee. Ah would our boyes, our lesser selves, were by thee! Those my 'live pictures to the world I give: So single onely die, in them twice-two I live. 18 You little souls, your sweetest times enjoy, And softly spend among your mothers kisses; And with your prettie sports and hurtlesse joy Supply your weeping mothers grievous misses: Ah, while you may, enjoy your little blisses, While yet you nothing know: when back you view, Sweet will this knowledge seem, when yet you nothing knew. 19 For when to riper times your yeares arrive, No more (ah then no more) may you go play you: Lancht in the deep farre from the wished hive, Change of worlds t?pests through blinde seas will sway you, Till to the long-long'd haven they convey you: Through many a wave this brittle life must passe, And cut the churlish seas, shipt in a bark of glasse. 20 How many ships in quick-sands swallow'd been! What gaping waves, whales, monsters there expect you! How many rocks, much sooner felt then seen! Yet let no fear, no coward fright affect you: He holds the stern, and he will safe direct you, Who to my sails thus long so gently blew, That now I touch the shore, before the seas I knew. 21 I touch the shore, and see my rest preparing. Oh blessed God! how infinite a blessing Is in this thought, that through this troubled faring, Through all the faults this guiltie age depressing I guiltlesse past, no helplesse man oppressing; And coming now to thee, lift to the skies Unbribed hands, cleans'd heart, and never tainted eyes! 22 Life, life! how many Sylla's dost thou hide In thy calm streams, which sooner kill then threaten! Gold, honour, greatnesse, and their daughter, pride! More quiet lives, and lesse with tempests beaten, Whose middle state content doth richly sweeten: He knows not strife, or brabling lawyers brawls; His love and wish live pleas'd within his private walls. 23 The King he never sees, nor fears, nor prayes; Nor sits court-promise and false hopes lamenting: Within that house he spends and ends his dayes, Where day he viewed first: his hearts contenting, His wife, and babes; nor sits new joyes inventing: Unspotted there, and quiet he remains; And 'mong his duteous sonnes most lov'd and fearlesse reignes. 24 Thou God of peace, with what a gentle tide Through this worlds raging tempest hast thou brought me! Thou, thou my open soul didst safely hide, When thousand crafty foes so nearely sought me; Els had the endlesse pit too quickly caught me; That endlesse pit, where it is easier never To fall, then being fall'n to cease from falling ever. 25 I never knew or want or luxurie, Much lesse their followers; or cares tormenting, Or ranging lust, or base-bred flatterie: I lov'd, and was belov'd with like consenting: My hate was hers, her joy my sole contenting: Thus long I liv'd, and yet have never prov'd Whether I lov'd her more, or more by her was lov'd. 26 Foure babes (the fift with thee I soon shall finde) With equall grace in soul and bodie fram'd: And lest these goods might swell my bladder'd minde, (Which last I name, but should not last be nam'd) A sicknesse long my stubborn heart hath tam'd, And taught me pleasing goods are not the best; But most unblest he lives, that lives here ever blest. 27 Ah life, once vertues spring, now sink of evil! Thou change of pleasing pain, and painfull pleasure; Thou brittle painted bubble, shop o'th' devil; How dost thou bribe us with false gilded treasure, That in thy joyes we finde no mean or measure! How dost thou witch! I know thou dost deceive me: I know I should, I must, and yet I would not leave thee. 28 Ah death! once greatest ill, now onely blessing, Untroubled sleep, short travel, ever resting, All sicknesse cure, thou end of all distressing, Thou one meals fast, usher to endlesse feasting; Though hopelesse griefs crie out thy aid requesting, Though thou art sweetned by a life most hatefull; How is't, that when thou com'st, thy coming is ungratefull? 29 Frail flesh, why would'st thou keep a hated guest, And him refuse whom thou hast oft invited? Life thy tormenter, death thy sleep and rest. And thou (poore soul) why at his sight art frighted, Who clears thine eyes, and makes thee eagle-sighted? Mount now my soul, &amp; seat thee in thy throne: Thou shalt be one with him, by whom thou first wast one. 30 Why should'st thou love this star, this borrow'd light, And not that Sunne, at which thou oft hast guessed, But guess'd in vain? which dares thy piercing sight, Which never was, which cannot be expressed? Why lov'st thy load, &amp; joy'st to be oppressed? Seest thou those joyes? those thousand thousand graces? Mount now my soul, &amp; leap to those outstretcht embraces. 31 Deare countrey, I must leave thee; and in thee No benefit, which most doth pierce and grieve me: Yet had not hasty death prevented me, I would repay my life, and somewhat give thee: My sonnes for that I leave; and so I leave thee: Thus heav'n commands; the lord outrides the page, And is arriv'd before: death hath prevented age. 32 My dearest Bettie, my more loved heart, I leave thee now; with thee all earthly joying: Heav'n knows, with thee alone I sadly part: All other earthly sweets have had their cloying; Yet never full of thy sweet loves enjoying, Thy constant loves, next heav'n I did referre them: Had not much grace prevail'd, 'fore heav'n I should preferre them. 33 I leave them, now the trumpet calls away; In vain thine eyes beg for some times reprieving; Yet in my children here immortall stay: In one I die, in many ones am living: In them, and for them stay thy too much grieving: Look but on them, in them thou still wilt see Marry'd with thee again thy twice-two Antonie. 34 And when with little hands they stroke thy face, As in thy lap they sit (ah carelesse) playing, And stammering ask a kisse, give them a brace; The last from me: and then a little staying, And in their face some part of me survaying, In them give me a third, and with a teare Shew thy deare love to him, who lov'd thee ever deare. 35 And now our falling house leans all on thee; This little nation to thy care commend them: In thee it lies that hence they want not me; Themselves yet cannot, thou the more defend them; And when green age permits, to goodnesse bend them: A mother were you once, now both you are: Then with this double style double your love and care. 36 Turn their unwarie steps into the way: What first the vessel drinks, it long retaineth; No barres will hold, when they have us'd to stray: And when for me one asks, and weeping plaineth, Point thou to heav'n, and say, he there remaineth: And if they live in grace, grow, and persever, There shall they live with me: els shall they see me never. 37 My God, oh in thy fear here let them live; Thy wards they are, take them to thy protection: Thou gav'st them first, now back to thee I give; Direct them thou, and help her weak direction; That reunited by thy strong election, Thou now in them, they then may live in thee; And seeing here thy will, may there thy glorie see. 38 Bettie, let these last words long with thee dwell: If yet a second Hymen do expect thee, Though well he love thee, once I lov'd as well: Yet if his presence make thee lesse respect me, Ah do not in my childrens good neglect me: Let me this faithfull hope departing have; More easie shall I die, and sleep in carelesse grave. 39 Farewell, farewell; I feel my long long rest, And iron sleep my leaden heart oppressing: Night after day, sleep after labour's best; Port after storms, joy after long distressing: So weep thy losse, as knowing 'tis my blessing: Both as a widow and a Christian grieve: Still live I in thy thoughts, but as in heav'n I live. 40 Death, end of old joyes, entrance into new, I follow thee, I know I am thy debtour; Not unexpect thou com'st to claim thy due: Take here thine own, my souls too heavie fetter; Not life, lifes place I change, but for a better: Take thou my soul, that bought'st it: cease your tears: Who sighing leaves the earth, himself and heaven fears. 41 Thus said, and while the bodie slumbring lay, (As Theseus Ariadne's bed forsaking) His quiet soul stole from her house of clay; And glorious Angels on their wings it taking, Swifter then lightning flew, for heaven making: There happie goes he, heav'nly fires admiring, Whose motion is their bait; whose rest is restlesse giring: 42 And now the courts of that thrice blessed King It enters, and his presence sits enjoying; While in it self it findes an endlesse spring Of pleasures new, and never weary joying, Ne're spent in spending; feeding, never cloying: Weak pen to write! for thought can never feign them: The minde that all can hold, yet cannot half contain th?. 43 There doth it blessed sit, and looking down, Laughs at our busie care, and idle paining; And fitting to it self that glorious crown, Scorns earth, where even Kings most serve by reigning; Where men get wealth, and hell; so loose by gaining. Ah blessed soul! there sit thou still delighted, Till we at length to him with thee shall be united. 44 But when at last his Lady sad espies His flesh of life, her self of him deprived; Too full of grief, closing his quenched eyes, As if in him, by him, for him she lived, Fell dead with him; and once again revived, Fell once again: pain wearie of his paining, And grief with too much grief felt now no grief remaining. 45 Again reliev'd, all silent sat she long; No word to name such grief durst first adventer: Grief is but light that floats upon the tongue, But weightie sorrow presses to the center, And never rests till th' heavie heart it enter; And in lifes house was married to life: Grief made life grievous seem, and life enlivens grief: 46 And from their bed proceeds a numerous presse, First shrieks, then tears &amp; sighs the hearts ground renting: In vain poore Muse would'st thou such dole expresse; For thou thy self lamenting her lamenting, And with like grief transform'd to like tormenting, With heavie pace bring'st forth thy lagging verse, Which cloath'd with blackest lines attends the mournfull herse. 47 The cunning hand which that Greek Princesse drew Readie in holy fires to be consum'd, Pitie and sorrow paints in divers hue; One wept, he pray'd, this sigh'd, that chaf'd and fum'd; But not to limme her fathers look presum'd: For well he knew his skilfull hand had fail'd: Best was his sorrow seen, when with a cloth 'twas vail'd. 48 Look as a nightingale, whose callow young Some boy hath markt, and now half nak'd hath taken, Which long she closely kept, and foster'd long, But all in vain; she now poore bird forsaken Flies up and down, but grief no place can slaken: All day, and night her losse she fresh doth rue, And where she ends her plaints, there soon begins anew: 49 Thus sat she desolate, so short a good, Such gift so soon exacted sore complaining: Sleep could not passe, but almost sunk i' th' floud; So high her eye-banks swell'd with endlesse raining: Surfet of grief had bred all meats disdaining: A thousand times my Antonie, she cried, Irby a thousand times; and in that name she died. 50 Thus circling in her grief it never ends, But moving round back to it self enclineth; Both day and night alike in grief she spends: Day shews her day is gone, no sun there shineth: Black night her fellow mourner she defineth: Light shews his want, and shades his picture draw: Him (nothing) best she sees, when nothing now she saw. [CANT. II.] 1 Thou blacker Muse, whose rude uncombed hairs With fatal eugh and cypresse still are shaded; Bring hither all thy sighs, hither thy teares: As sweet a plant, as fair a flower is faded, As ever in the Muses garden bladed; While th' owner (haplesse owner) sits lamenting, And but in discontent &amp; grief, findes no contenting. 2 The sweet (now sad) Elisa weeping lies, While fair Alicia's words in vain relieve her; In vain those wells of grief she often dries: What her so long, now doubled sorrows give her, What both their loves (which doubly double grieve her) She carelesse spends without or end or measure; Yet as it spends, it grows: poor grief can tell his treasure. 3 All as a turtle on a bared bough (A widow turtle) joy and life despises, Whose trustie mate (to pay his holy vow) Some watchfull eye late in his roost surprises, And to his God for errour sacrifices; She joylesse bird sits mourning all alone, And being one when two, would now be two, or none: 4 So sat she gentle Lady weeping sore, Her desert self and now cold lord lamenting; So sat she carelesse on the dusty floor, As if her tears were all her souls contenting: So sat she, as when speechlesse griefs tormenting Locks up the heart, the captive tongue enchaining: So sat she joylesse down in wordlesse grief complaining. 5 Her chearfull eye (which once the crystall was, Where Love and Beautie dress'd their fairest faces, And fairer seem'd by looking in that glasse) Had now in tears drown'd all their former graces: Her snow-white arms, whose warm &amp; sweet embraces Could quicken death, their now dead lord infold, And seem'd as cold and dead as was the flesh they hold. 6 The roses in her cheek grow pale and wan; As if his pale cheeks livery they affected: Her head, like fainting flowers opprest with rain, On her left shoulder lean'd his weight neglected: Her dark-gold locks hung loosly unrespected; As if those fairs, which he alone deserv'd, With him had lost their use, and now for nothing serv'd. 7 Her Lady sister sat close by her side, Alicia, in whose face Love proudly lorded; Where Beauties self and Mildnesse sweet reside, Where every Grace her naked sight afforded, And Majestie with Love sat well accorded: A little map of heav'n, sweet influence giving; More perfect yet in this, it was a heaven living. 8 Yet now this heav'n with melting clouds was stain'd: Her starry eyes with sister grief infected Might seem the Pleiades, so fast they rain'd: And though her tongue to comfort she directed, Sighs waiting on each word like grief detected; That in her face you now might plainly see Sorrow to sit for Love, Pitie for Majestie. 9 At length when now those storms she had allay'd, A league with grief for some short time indenting; She 'gan to speak, and sister onely said: The sad Elisa soon her words preventing, El. In vain you think to ease my hearts tormenting; Words, comforts, hope, all med'cine is in vain: My heart most hates his cure, &amp; loves his pleasing pain. Al. As vain to weep, since fate cannot reprieve. El. Teares are most due, when there is no reprieving. Al. When doom is past, weak hearts that fondly grieve. El. A helplesse griefs sole joy is joylesse grieving. Al. To losses old new losse is no relieving: You lose your teares. El. When that I onely fear For ever now is lost, poore losse to lose a teare. Al. Nature can teach, that who is born must die. El. And Nature teaches teares in griefs tormenting. Al. Passions are slaves to Reasons monarchie. El. Reason best shews her reason in lamenting. Al. Religion blames impatient discontenting. El. Not passion, but excesse Religion branded; Nor ever countermands what Natures self commanded. Al. That hand which gave him first into your hand, To his own hand doth now again receive him: Impious and fond, to grudge at his command, Who once by death from death doth ever reave him! He lives by leaving life, which soon would leave him: Thus God and him you wrong by too much crying. Who living dy'd to life, much better lives by dying. El. Not him I plain, ill would it fit our loves, In his best state to shew my hearts repining; To mourn at others good, fond envy proves: I know his soul is now more brightly shining Then all the stars their light in one combining: No, dearest soul; (so lifting up her eyes, Which shew'd like watry suns quench't in the moister skies) 14 My deare, my dearest Irby, (at that name, As at a well-known watch-word, forth there pressed Whole flouds of teares, and straight a suddain quame Seizing her heart, her tongue with weight oppressed, And lockt her grief within her soul distressed; There all in vain he close and hidden lies: Silence is sorrows speech; his tongue speaks in her eyes: 15 Till grief new mounted on uneven wings Of loud-breath'd sighs, his leaden weight up sending, Back to the tongue his heavie presence brings, His usher teares, deep grones behinde attending, And in his name her breath most gladly spending, As if he gone, his name were all her joying) Irby, I never grudg'd thee heav'n, and heav'ns enjoying. 16 'Tis not thy happinesse that breeds my smart, It is my losse, and cause that made me lose thee; Which hatching first this tempest in my heart, Thus justly rages; he that lately chose thee To live with him, where thou might'st safe repose thee, Hath found some cause out of my little caring, By spoiling thine to spare, and spoil my life by sparing. 17 Whither, ah whither shall I turn my head, Since thou my God so sore my heart hast beaten? Thy rods yet with my bloud are warm and red: Thy scourge my soul hath drunk, my flesh hath eaten. Who helps, when thou my Father so dost threaten? Thou hid'st thy eyes; or if thou dost not hide them, So dost thou frown, that best I hidden may abide them. 18 I weeping grant, what ever may be dreaded, All ill thou canst inflict, I have deserved; Thy mercy I, I mercie onely pleaded. Most wretched men, if all that from thee swerved, By merit onely in just weight were served! If nought thou giv'st, but what desert doth get me, Oh give me nothing then; for nothing I intreat thee. 19 Ah wherefore are thy mercies infinite, If thou dost hourd them up, and never spend them? Mercy's no mercy hid in envious night: The rich mans goods, while in his chest he penn'd them, Were then no goods; much better to misspend them. Why mak'st thou such a rod? so fierce dost threat me? Thy frowns to me were rods; thy forehead would have beat me. 20 Thou seiz'd my joy; ah he is dead and gone, That might have dress'd my wounds, when thus they smarted: To all my griefs I now am left alone; Comfort's in vain to hopelesse grief imparted: Hope, comfort, joy with him are all departed. Comfort, hope, joy, lifes flatterers, most I flie you, And would not deigne to name, but naming to defie you. Al Sister, too farre your passions violent heat And griefs too headlong in your plaint convay you: You feel your stripes, but mark not who does beat; 'Tis he that takes away, who can repay you: This grief to other rods doth open lay you: He bindes your grief to patience, not dejection. Who bears the first not well, provokes a new correcti?. El. I know 'tis true; but sorrows blubber'd eye Fain would not see, and cannot well behold it: My heart surround with grief is swoll'n so high, It will not sink, till I alone unfold it; But grows more strong, the more you do withhold it: Leave me a while alone; griefs tide grows low, And ebs, when private tears the eye-banks overflow. 23 She quickly rose, and readie now to go, [Al.] Remember measure in your griefs complaining; His last, his dying words command you so: So left her; and Elisa sole remaining, Now every grief more boldly entertaining, They flock about her round; so one was gone, And twentie fresh arriv'd. 'Lone grief is least alone. 24 Thus as she sat with fixt and setled eye, Thousand fond thoughts their wandring shapes depainted: Now seem'd she mounted to the crystall skie, And one with him, and with him fellow-sainted; Straight pull'd from heav'n: &amp; then again she fainted: Thus while their numerous thoughts each fancie brought, The minde all idle sat: much thinking lost her thought. 25 And fancy, finding now the dulled sight Idle with businesse, to her soul presented (While th' heavy minde obscur'd his shaded light) Her wofull body from her head absented; And suddain starting, with that thought tormented, A thing impossible too true she found: The head was gone, and yet the headlesse body sound. 26 Nor yet awake she cries; ah this is wrong, To part what Natures hand so neare hath tied; Stay oh my head, and take thy trunk along: But then her minde (recall'd) her errour spied; And sigh'd to see how true the fancy lied, Which made the eye his instrument to see That true, which being true it self must nothing be. 27 Vile trunk (saies she) thy head is ever gone; Vile headlesse trunk, why art thou not engraved? One wast thou once with him, now art thou none; Or if thou art, or wert, how art thou saved? And livest still, when he to death is slaved? But (ah) when well I think, I plainly see, That death to him was life, and life is death to me. 28 Vile trunk, if yet he live; ah then again Why seek'st thou not with him to be combined? But oh since he in heav'n doth living reigne, Death wer't to him in such knots to be twined; And life to me with him to be confined: So while I better think, I eas'ly see My life to him were death, his death were life to me. 29 Then die with him, vile trunk, and dying live; Or rather with him live, his life applying; Where thou shalt never die, nor ever grieve: But ah, though death thou feel'st within thee lying, Thou ne're art dead, though still in sorrow dying: Most wretched soul, which hast thy seat and being, Where life with death is one, &amp; death with life agreeing! 30 He lives and joyes; death life to him hath bred: Why is he living then in earth enwombed? But I, a walking coarse, in life am dead: 'Tis I, my friends, 'tis I must be entombed; Whose joy with grief, whose life with death's benummed: Thou coffin art not his, nor he is thine; Mine art thou: thou the dead, &amp; not the livings shrine. 31 You few thinne boards, how in so scanted room So quiet such great enemies contain ye? All joy, all grief lies in this narrow tombe: You contraries, how thus in peace remain ye, That one small cabin so should entertain ye? But joy is dead, and here entomb'd doth lie, While grief is come to moan his dead-lov'd enemie. 32 How many vertues in this little space (This little little space) lie buried ever! In him they liv'd, and with them every grace: In him they liv'd, and di'd, and rise will never. Fond men! go now, in vertues steps persever; Go sweat, and toil; thus you inglorious lie: In this old frozen age vertue it self can die. 33 Those petty Northern starres do never fall; The unwasht Beare the Ocean wave despises; Ever unmov'd it moves, and ever shall: The Sun, which oft his head in night disguises, So often as he falls, so often rises; And stealing backward by some hidden way, With self same light begins and ends the yeare &amp; day. 34 The flowers, which in the absence of the Sunne Sleep in their winter-houses all disarm'd, And backward to their mothers wombe do runne; Soon as the earth by Taurus horns is warm'd, Muster their colour'd troups; and freshly arm'd, Spreading their braving colours to the skie, Winter and winters spight, bold little elves, defie. 35 But Vertues heav'nly and more glorious light, Though seeming ever sure, yet oft dismounteth; And sinking low, sleeps in eternall night, Nor ever more his broken spheare remounteth: Her sweetest flower, which other flowers surmounteth As farre as roses nettles, soonest fadeth: Down falls her glorious leaf, &amp; never more it bladeth. 36 And as that dainty flower, the maiden rose, Her swelling bosome to the Sunne discloses; Soon as her lover hot and fiery grows, Straight all her sweets unto his heat exposes, Then soon disrob'd her sweet and beautie loses; While hurtfull weeds, hemlocks, &amp; nettles stinking Soon from the earth ascend, late to their graves are sinking. 37 All so the vertuous bud in blooming falls, While vice long flourishing late sees her ending: Vertue once dead no gentle spring recalls; But vice springs of it self; and soon ascending, Long views the day, late to his night descending. Vain men, that in this life set up your rest, Which to the ill is long, and short unto the best! 38 And as a dream, where th' idle fancie playes, One thinks that fortune high his head advances; Another spends in woe his weary dayes; A third seems sport in love, and courtly dances; A fourth to finde some glitt'ring treasure chances; Soon as they wake, they see their thoughts were vain, And either quite forget, or laugh their idle brain: 39 Such is the world, and such lifes quick-spent play: This base, and scorn'd; that great, in high esteeming; This poore, and patched seems; that rich, and gay; This sick, that sound; yet all is but a seeming: So like that waking oft we fear w' are dreaming; And think we wake oft, when we dreaming play. Dreams are as living nights; life as a dreaming day. 40 Go then, vain life; for I will trust no more Thy flattering dreams: death, to thy resting take me: Thou sleep without all dreams, lifes quiet shore, When wilt thou come? when wilt thou overtake me? Enough I now have liv'd; loath'd life forsake me: Thou good mens endlesse fight, thou ill mens feast; That at the best art bad, and worst art to the best. 41 Thus as in teares she drowns her swollen eyes, A suddain noise recalls them; backward bending Her weary head, there all in black she spies Six mournfull bearers, the sad hearse attending, Their feet and hands to that last dutie lending: All silent stood she, trembling, pale, and wan; The first grief left his stage, a new his part began. 42 And now the coffin in their arms they take, While she with weight of grief sat still amazed; As do sear leaves in March, so did she quake, And with intented eyes upon them gazed: But when from ground the doleful hearse they raised, Down on the beer half dead she carelesse fell; While teares did talk apace, and sighs her sorrows tell. 43 At last, Fond men (said she) you are deceiv'd; It is not he, 'tis I must be interred: Not he, but I of life and soul bereav'd; He lives in heav'n, among the saints referred: This trunk, this headlesse body must be buried. But while by force some hold her, up they reare him, And weeping at her tears, away they softly beare him. 44 But then impatient grief all passion proves, She prayes &amp; weeps; with teares she doth intreat them: But when this onely fellow passion moves, She storms and raves, and now as fast doth threat them; And as she onely could, with words doth beat them; Ah cruell men, ah men most cruell, stay: It is my heart, my life, my soul, you beare away. 45 And now no sooner was he out of sight, As if she would make good what she had spoken, First from her hearts deep centre deep she sigh'd; Then, (as if heart, and life, and soul were broken) Down dead she fell; and once again awoken, Fell once again; so to her bed they bore her: While friends (no friends) hard love to life and grief restore her. 46 Unfriendly friends, (saith she) why do ye strive To barre wisht death from his so just ingression? Your pitie kills me; 'tis my death to live, And life to die: it is as great oppression To force out death, as life from due possession; 'Tis much more great: better that quickly spills A loathed life, then he that with long torture kills. 47 And then, as if her guiltlesse bed offended; Thou trait'rous bed, when first thou didst receive me, Not single to thy rest I then ascended: Double I came, why should I single leave thee? Why of my better part dost thou bereave me? Two prest thee first: why should but one depart? Restore, thou trait'rous bed, restore that better part. 48 Thus while one grief anothers place inherits, And one yet hardly spent, a new complained: Griefs leaden vapour dulls the heavy spirits, And sleep too long from so wisht seat restrained, Now of her eyes un'wares possession gained; And that she might him better welcome give, Her lord he new presents, and makes him fresh to live. 49 She thinks he lives, and with her goes along; And oft she kiss'd his cheek, and oft embraced; And sweetly askt him where he staid so long, While he again her in his arms enlaced; Till strong delight her dream and joy defaced: But then she willing sleeps; sleep glad receives her; And she as glad of sleep, that with such shapes deceives her. 50 Sleep widow'd eyes, and cease so fierce lamenting; Sleep grieved heart, and now a little rest thee: Sleep sighing words, stop all your discontenting; Sleep beaten breast; no blows shall now molest thee: Sleep happy lips; in mutuall kisses nest ye: Sleep weary Muse, and do not now disease her: Fancie, do thou with dreams and his sweet presence please her. FINIS. To my deare friend, the Spencer of this age. Deare friend, No more a Stranger now: I lately past Thy curious Building; call'd; but then my haste Deny'd me a full draught; I did but taste. Thy Wine was rich and pleasing; did appeare No common grape: My haste could not forbeare A second sippe; I hung a Garland there: Past on my way; I lasht through thick and thinne, Dispatch'd my businesse, and return'd agen; I call'd the second time; unhors'd, went in: View'd every Room; each Room was beautifi'd With new Invention, carv'd on every side, To please the common and the curious ey'd: View'd every Office; every Office lay Like a rich Magazen; &amp; did bewray Thy Treasure, op'ned with thy golden key: View'd every Orchyard; every Orchyard did Appeare a Paradise, whose fruits were hid (Perchance) with shadowing Leaves, but none forbid: View'd every Plot; spent some delightfull houres. In every Garden, full of new-born flowers, Delicious banks, and delectable bowers. Thus having stepp'd and travell'd every staire Within, and tasted every fruit that's rare Without; I made thy house my thorough-fare. Then give me leave, rare Fletcher, (as before I left a Garland at thy Gates) once more To hang this Ivie at thy Postern-doore. Francis Quarles. FINIS. VERSES AND TRANSLATIONS IN A FATHER'S TESTAMENT [RELIGIOUS MUSINGS.] [The Vanity of Possessions.] I Fond Soul! is this Thy way to bliss? Grasp both the Indies, let thy mighty hand The iron North, and golden South command; Transcend the Moon, Fasten thy Throne Above the fixed stars: above expressions, Above thy thought enlarge thy vast possessions; Fond soul! all this Cannot make up thy bliss. II All these are vain, Full, but with pain: All Creatures have their end to serve, not bless thee; As Servants they may help, as Lords oppress thee. They vex in getting, Us'd, lost with fretting; Can slaves advance, shades fill, can grief give rest? That, which was curs'd for thee, can't make thee blest. They all are vain, And bring not bliss, but pain. III Fond Soul! thy birth Is not of Earth, Or Heav'n: thou Earth, and Heav'n it self survivest: Though born in time, thou dying time out-livest. They fail, deceive thee, They age, dye, leave thee; Soar up immortal spirit, and mounting fly Into the arms of great Eternity; Not Heav'n, or Earth, He, he thy End, and Birth. Paraphrase in Verse upon...Ecclesiast[es] 2. I Oh I am tir'd, I faint, I swoon, I dye, I travel all the world to find a station, Where weary souls may safe, and happy lye, I search for rest, feel but vexation; I grope for substance, grasp but vanity; I seek for life, and health, find death, damnation; I meet approaching death, death to eschew: Toyl'd with vain sweat, I wax old, to renew My weary life: so spend, and hate what I pursue. II To Pleasures house I sail'd, and safe arriv'd I lookt for Joy, but found a Bedlam there: Into rich Mammons baggs, and Chests I div'd, But saw them fill'd with grief, with care, and fear: The Crown was but a Skep, where swarms are hiv'd Of stinging thoughts; it wears me which I wear. Has man no good? is't lost? or am I blind? Who? who will point the way? or cleer my mind? To find what I should seek, to seek that I may find? III Look as th' industrious Bee from flowr to flowr Jumps lightly, visits all, but dwells in none: Or as a sickly taste tries sweet, and sowre, Runs through a World of dishes, finds not one To please his curious Palate: has no power To relish what it likes: this bit, that bone Long'd for, and loath'd: thus my unquiet breast In Earth, Seas, Ayer, Heav'n vainly seeks for rest: But serving them is curst, and serv'd by them not blest. IV Can rivers seek, find rest in restless Seas? Can Ayer in stormy ayers quiet stay? Can Heavens find in swiftest raptures ease? Has only man no Centre? none to lay His weary soul to rest? no place to ease His boundless thoughts? Me thinks I see a ray, A glorious beam break through Heav'ns Canopy; Me thinks I hear a voice, Come Soul, and see, Come; here, here lies thy rest; rest in my word, &amp; me. V It is thy lovely voice, great Love, oh where, Where, Lord of love, where should I seek to find thee? In every place I see thy footsteps cleer, Yet find thee not: what are the mists that blind me? I know Lord where thou art, and seek thee there, Yet there I find not: thee before, behind me, On every side I see, yet seeing blind I find not what I see: but heark (my mind) He speaks again: Soul seek, seek thou, and I will find. [The Search after God.] Vast Ocean of light, whose rayes surround The Universe, who know'st nor ebb, nor shore, Who lend'st the Sun his sparkling drop, to store With overflowing beams Heav'n, ayer, ground, Whose depths beneath the Centre none can sound, Whose heights 'bove heav'n, and thoughts so lofty soar, Whose breadth no feet, no lines, no chains, no eyes survey, Whose length no thoughts can reach, no worlds can bound, What cloud can mask thy face? where can thy ray Find an Eclipse? what night can hide Eternal Day? Our Seas (a drop of thine) with arms dispread Through all the earth make drunk the thirsty plains; Our Sun (a spark of thine) dark shadows drains, Guilds all the world, paints earth, revives the dead; Seas (through earth pipes distill'd) in Cisterns shed, And power their liver springs in river veins. The Sun peeps through jet clouds, and when his face, and gleams Are maskt, his eyes their light through ayers spread, Shall dullard earth bury life-giving streams? Earths foggs impound heav'ns light? hell quench heav'nkindling beams? How miss I then? in bed I sought by night, But found not him in rest, nor rest without him. I sought in Towns, in broadest streets I sought him, But found not him where all are lost: dull sight Thou canst not see him in himself: his light Is maskt in light: brightness his cloud about him. Where, when, how he'l be found, there, then, thus seek thy love: Thy Lamb in flocks, thy Food with appetite, Thy Rest on resting dayes, thy Turtle Dove Seek on his cross: there, then, thus Love stands nail'd with love. [The Beatific Vision.] I How is't, my soul, that thou giv'st eyes their sight To view their objects, yet hast none To see thine own? Earths, ayers, Heav'ns beauties they discern; their light Fair flowers admires; their several dresses, Their golden tresses; The Lilly, Rose, the various Tulip, scorning The pride of Princes in their choice adorning. II They joy to view the ayers painted Nations; The Peacocks train, which th' head out vies With fairer eyes, And emulats the heav'nly constellations; The Ostrich, whose fair plume embraves Kings, Captains, Slaves; The Halcions, whose Triton-bills appease Curl'd waves, and with their Eggs lay stormy seas. III Pilots fixt eyes observe the Artick Bear, With all her unwasht Starry trains In Heav'nly plains. Night-Travellers behold the Moon to steer Her Ship, sailing (while Eol raves) Through cloudy waves: Our less Worlds sunns with pleasure view the light Which gives all beauties beauty, them their sight. IV Thou that giv'st sight to clay, to blackness light How art so dull, so dimm in duty To view his beauty, Who quickens every life, lights every light? His height those Eagles eyes surpasses; Thou wants thy glasses: Take up that Perspective, and view those streams Of light, and fill thy waning Orb with beams. V Then see the flowers clad in his Liveries, And from his cheek, and lovely face Steal all their grace. See Fouls from him borrow their braveries, And all their feather-painted dresses From his fair tresses: See Starrs, and Moon, the Sun, and all perfection Beg light, and life from his bright eyes reflection. VI Look on his lipps; heav'ns gate there open lies: Thence that grace-breathing Spirit blows, Thence honey flowes. Look on his hands, the Worlds full treasuries; Fix all thy looks his heart upon, Loves highest Throne. And when thy sight that radiant beauty blears, And dazels thy weak eyes; see with thine ears. [The Passage Perilous.] No other passage? what? no way but this Can bring my Pilgrim soul to rest, and bliss? Proud Seas in Gyant waves 'gainst Heaven rise, And casting mounts, fight with loud-thundring Skies, Skies charge their double Cannons, and let fly Their fires, and bullets; waters hizz, and fry. How shall my tir'd Bark climb those mounts? how shall It fall, and not than hell much deeper fall? How shall a Potsheard stand one Volly? how Shall glass cut through such storms, with brittle prow? Were sails as wings to mount me o're those hills; Who could secure me in those lesser rills? Where Sirens fill the ear, and eye with wonder: I more fear calm than storms, more songs than thunder. Lend to the Latine Siren eyes, and ears, Her face will seem an Angel, voice the Spheres. The Belgian melts the soul with sugred strains, Drops Wine, and loosness into swilling veins. A third Gold, Plenty, Wealth, abundance sings: And binds the captive ear with silver strings. A fourth guilds all her notes with Thrones, and Crowns, So Heav'n in earth, glory in honour drowns. The last powrs honey from her pleasant Hive, So stings, and kills, and buries men alive. Lord steer my Bark: draw thou mine eye, and ear From those vain frights, thy Word, and thee to fear. Lord tune my heart to hear (in Saintly throngs) More musick in thy thunders, than their songs. Make me to think in all these storms, and charms, In Sirens notes, and thundring Worlds alarms, Thy presence is my guard, my Port, thy Bed and arms. [The Divine Lover.] I Me Lord? can'st thou mispend One word, misplace one look on me? Call'st me thy Love, thy Friend? Can this poor soul the object be Of these love-glances, those life-kindling eyes? What? I the Centre of thy arms embraces? Of all thy labour I the prize? Love never mocks, Truth never lies. Oh how I quake: Hope fear, fear hope displaces: I would, but cannot hope: such wondrous love amazes. II See, I am black as night, See I am darkness: dark as hell. Lord thou more fair than light; Heav'ns Sun thy Shadow: can Sunns dwell With Shades? 'twixt light, and darkness what commerce? True: thou art darkness, I thy Light: my ray Thy mists, and hellish foggs shall pierce. With me, black soul, with me converse. I make the foul December flowry May, Turn thou thy night to me: I'le turn thy night to day. III See Lord, see I am dead: Tomb'd in my self: my self my grave. A drudge: so born, so bred: My self even to my self a slave. Thou Freedome, Life: can Life, and Liberty Love bondage, death? Thy Freedom I: I tyed To loose thy bonds: be bound to me: My Yoke shall ease, my bonds shall free. Dead soul, thy Spring of life, my dying side: There dye with me to live: to live in thee I dyed. [The Divine Offer.] Behold, behold me: view, search every part: Let beauty wooe thy eyes, thy eyes thy heart. Thou dost, Lord, what thou speak'st; I somewhat see, That I see nothing, nor my self, nor thee. 'Noint thee: what seest thou now? What tongue can tell? In thee ten thousand heav'ns, in me an hell. How lik'st thy self poor soul? how lik'st thou me? Lord, I am dung, and all things dung to thee. I made thee first, and come, now, new to make thee; If then thou lik'st, stretch forth thy hand, and take me. Take thee? Lord thou more rich than heav'n can make thee. I poor; tak'st thou no portion but to take thee? Lord I am naked, foul, thou can'st but loath me: Ask'st thou no beauty but to cleanse, and cloath me? Oh I am base: my self my self disdain: Wilt thou no honour, but with thee to reign? Is this thy whole demand, to leave mine own, And take thee for my portion, beauty, Crown? A glorious offer: madness to refuse it: An easie choice: yet wretch I cannot chuse it. Maim'd wretch! I see my bliss; yet, till thou make it, I have no will to chuse, no hand to take it. Let th' hand, which thee, which all thy glory proffers, Give me an hand to take thy glorious offers. Form, draw mine eyes; so shall I still behold thee; Make, hold my hand: so shall I take, grasp, hold thee. [Israel's Yoke.] I A grievous, heavy Yoke! bonds! burthens! cords! Ungrateful Israel! his happy reign Heaps plentie, peace; mirth, safety, honour hords; Lades you with gold; is this your load? your Lords Turns to your slaves; are these the bonds ye[e] playn? Tunes groanes to songs: is this your Yoke, and chain? Was wisest Solomon a Tyrant? peace Ungrateful Israel, thy false grumbling cease: Thy wealth his grievous bond; his heavy Yoke thy peace. II Lord! Solomon was but thy shadow: he A peaceful Prince, and thou the Prince of peace. The world is Israels type, who (blinded) see Freedom in bonds, and bonds in libertie. Thee they proclaym an hard man, hard to please; Thy easy, easing Yoke lades with disease: But murthering Satan, lust the soul oppressing, The cheating world, by pleasing most distressing, These are their gentle Lords, their cursed Yokes their blessing. III Poor souls have you no eyes? your eyes no light? These old eyes nothing see; see nothing true. Get Perspectives; oh help your feeble sight; Blind eyes make night as day, and day as night: Turn to the light, and your old eyes renew. Shake off hells spectacles, and better vieu Your Lords, and service: had you light, and eyes, How could you hate the truth, and love these lies? Despise what you admire; admire what you despise. IV Their Kings are servants; but his servants Kings. Their rest an Iron Yoke; his Yoke your rest. His wounds are salves: their salves are wounding stings. His death brings life; their life death surely brings. Their feast a pining fast: his fast a feast. His servants blest when curst; theirs curst when blest. Poor souls be wise: but if ye (fools) disdein To serve this Lord in rest, serve those in payn. Serve them in Hell, who scorn with him in Heaven to reign. [God's Image in Man.] I Is this the Yoke which fools abhor, to be, (Great Lord) made like to thee? Is this a burthen? Cannot flesh indure To be as thou art, pure? Is this so scorn'd, so loathsome a condition? Poor swinish soul! canst thou desire To be an Hog? daub'd, cas'd in mire? Is this the height of thy deep faln ambition? II This all the service which thou dost desire, To wash me from my mire? This all the burthen which thou laist upon me, To set thy beautie on me? That beautie, which those glorious Spirits viewing, Are rapt in heavenly ecstasies, Drink healths, and making drunk their eyes, Sing, drencht in amorous joyes, thy praise renewing. III How beauteous is thy house? thy spangled Court? Yet to thy beautie durt. How glorious is the Sun, the spring of light? Yet to thy glory night. How bright thy Angels in their spritely feature? Yet to thy brightness smoke to fire. How then should we (poor souls!) admire Thy beautie, glory, brightness in thy creature. IV Oh what am I (my Lord!) without thy likeness, But a dull dying sickness? Stript of thy Image, and that God-like feature I, less than any creature. The meanest, sensless, liveless overgits me, And goes beyond me; stones last longer, Flowers are fairer, trees are stronger: The beasts out-sense, the Divels self outwits me. V Let Swine then serve their muddy lusts, and ly Mir'd in their stinking stie. Doggs serve the ravening world, devour, be sick, Spew, and their vomit lick. But oh let me renew my first condition, Conform'd unto thy glorious beautie Serve thee in every holy dutie. This my whole honour, this my sole ambition. [The Light of Lights.] Great Fount of light, whose overflowing streams Lend stars their dimmer sparks, Suns brighter beams, Thy mouth spoke light, thy hands at first did shed it Along the skie, and through the ayer did spred it, So shadedst earth with curtains of the night, And drewst those curtains to give days their light. Then gathering all that scattered light, compactedst In one vast burning Lamp, and strait enactedst That all less lights should beg their borrowed beams, And from that fountain fill their narrow streams: So that more spiritual, and sacred ray Which rising from thy mouth gave spirits day, In those first ages had no certain sphere, But breath'd by thee, shin'd forth from mouth to ear; At length collected by thy gracious Spirit, Fills all the world with light, with life, and spirit. There I behold thy self, thy Lamb, and Dove, Shining in grace, burning in heavenly love: There I my death, and thine; thy power, my duty See, and by seeing change into thy beautie. Lord let thy light draw off my wandring eyes From empty forms, and lying vanities; Oh fix them on thy self, and make me see (My Light!) in all things nothing, all in thee. Thou boughtst me all, oh make me all thine own; Be all in me, I all in thee alone. [The Transfiguration of Man.] I Ayer of her self is dark, and hath no light But what Heaven lends her, and when angry skies Call in their debt, she sinks in dungeon night. Nay while she borrowes light, oft foggs arise, Or storms, and filch by stealth, or rob by might Her lone: her day in youth, or childhood dies. But while the present Suns with conquering ray Dispel the shades, and their strong beams display, She sparkles all with light, and broider'd gold-array. II Such now is Man: inform, void, empty, dark, A Chaos, dungeon, grave, a starless night: Rake all his ashes up, ther's not a spark To tine quencht life, or kindle buried light: And what he steals from others, (empty shark!) Hell with his mists depraves: so robbs him quite. But when his Life, and Light shines in his eyes, In him he lives as he, and never dies; Glittring in light divine, he heaven, stars, Sun out-vies. III For as in earthly sight the bodies eye (To the object bent) is like the object form'd; So when the soul turn'd to the Deitie Receives his likeness, it is soon transform'd To what it sees: death, hell, and darkness fly, And all the spirit to Light, and Life conform'd. Soul of my soul! draw my souls eyes to thee; Set them upon thy face; make me to be By seeing Life, and Light, the Light, and Life I see. [TRANSLATIONS OF METRA IN BOETHIUS' DE CONSOLATIONE PHILOSOPHIÃ.] Boetius. Libr. 2. Metr. 2. If Mammon empty all his baggs, to store The greedy mind, (as Seas heap sands on shore) If earth with Heaven vie Angels for her lovers, And every star with golden Pieces covers; If Plenty, hills of wealth, and mountains heaps, And what it largely gives, as safely keeps; The dropsie soul still whines, still thirsts, and pants For earth, and feels not what it has but wants. When God the mouth, the throat, the skin hath cram'd With gold, the heart still gapes, and gasps as clam'd. Nor earth, nor seas, nor heaven can quench this drouth: As hell it ever yawns, ne're shuts the mouth. What rein, what curb can bridle lustful fires? And manage them in pace of just desires? When all the gifts which from free Heaven came Are but as oyl, and fuel to the flame. He never can be full who feeds on ayre; He never can be rich, who dreams he's poor, and bare. Boetius. Libr. 4. Metr. 2. Those earthly Gods you trembling view Mounted on starry thrones, Array'd with Heaven (in spangled blue) Guarded with armed drones, With raging hearts, and lightning browes, Storming with thundring mouths, Could you unlace their vain attires, And peep into their brest, With chains, with gyves, with tortures, fires Th' Oppressors lye opprest. Clos'd in that shew, and Heav'n-like shell You'l find the kernel hell. Distracting lusts with cruel twitches Rack the disjoynted Ghost: Hope backs the heart, and spurrs, and switches Wrath, anger, fear, and rost: Hate, Envy scourge with snaky wreath; Griefs, pressing, squeese to death. When then so many Tyrant Lords Reign in one single brest; How can it (bound with self-will'd cords) Do what it self thinks best? He that rules men, serves lust, 's a thing, Much greater slave, than King. Boetius. Libr. 3. Metr. 7. All Pleasures ride with spurs: they goar the heart, And drive it first to run, and then to smart. Pleasures are Bees; Bees have their bag, and sting; Those drops of sweet, these streams of torment bring. The bag flies with the Bee; the sting remains: How flitting are our joyes? how lasting pains? He that in honied Hive of Pleasure dwells, Soon dies to Heav'n, lives to a thousand hells. Boetius. Libr. 3. Metr. 8. When Ignorance leads fools (both blind) they stray. How should they hitt, or miss their end, or way? We seek not grapes on thorns, on thistles figgs: Who gathers pearls from Vines, or gold from twiggs? He that would feast his guests with Lenten dishes, Draggs not dry Mountains, nor thin Ayer fishes. He that with Ven'son would his palate please, Swims not his Hounds in Brooks, or hunts the Seas. Tethis black Closets (hid with dark deep floods) Men search, know, rifle, ransack all her goods. Where brightest Pearls she hoords in Oyster cells, Where Coral grafts, where stores her purple shells: They know her Markets, Fairs, where, when to buy Each kind of Fish; where Crabs, where Lobsters lye; But where that good, which makes man blessed, lyes, They have no ears to hear, to see, no eyes. On earth fools hunt, which far transcends the poles: They tear, dig, delve, (oh are they men, or moles?) What curse deserve such Bedlams? blindfold wretches Tir'd let them still pursue their honours, riches, And prest with false goods, give them eyes to view The dross of false, the glory of the true. Boetius. Libr. 3. Metr. 10. Come, hither come (poor Captives) you whose minds With dust (cast in your eyes) Lust cheating blinds, And to base earth with willing fetters binds: Come weary souls, here rest, here quiet bide, Come, anchor, here's your Port, here safely ride: Your guilt in this close Sanctuary hide. Nor Golden Tagus, nor bright He[r]mus streams, Nor India's self, whose womb Sols hotter beams Fill with rich seed, red, white, green glittering gems, No sparkling Pearls your quenched snuff can tine: The more ye cleave to their deceitful shine, The more y' are buried in their Dungeon mine. Their glistering rayes, which kindle fond desire, Are earthly, and beget but fatuous fire; Shine but in night: they rise, and set in mire. But this Eternal Sun (whose splendour bright Rules, quickens all, gives you both life, and light) The eye that wistly views with fixed sight, Will swear the Starrs, the Moon, the Sun it self is night. Boetius. Libr. 3. Metr. 12. Thrice happy soul, that turns his Sphere of sight To that great Sun, and Fount of goodness bright; Thence fills his waining Orb with true, eternal light. Happy! who loosing his clogg'd feet, and hands From pressing earths, and hells oppressing bands, Mounts, soaring up to Heaven, and at that haven lands. Once Orpheus plaining at his Spouses bier, Gave Rocks a weeping eye, and listning ear; Brooks staid their hasty stream; woods left their roots to hear. But when no Muse his wounded heart could plaister, Songs fann'd his fires, and flames brake out the faster, His verses pleasing all, but easing not their Master, Weary of life, to hell he desperate flings, There fits his sweetest voice to sweeter strings, And into pitty Lords of Shades, and darkness sings. There what his Mothers spring, there what his eyes, (Griefs double fountain) what (which both out-vies) Lost-longing love affords, he to stern Ghosts applyes. Hells bauling Dog pricks up his thrice two ears, To houl, to bark, to snarl, to whine he fears: Haggs still their hissing snakes; and Furies melt in tears. Then first Ixion, and his wheel take rest; Tantale neglects his tast, his ear to feast; The Vulture, full of verse, scorns Titius loathed brest. Dis yields, and with this law restores his Love, Till hell be left, his sight back must not move. Who gives Love laws? alas! Loves only law is love. Now past black Stix, near to the verge of Skies, Forc'd by desire, turning his longing eyes, Euridice (at once) he saw, he lost, he dies. This Fable looks to thee, who tir'd with night Desir'st to draw thy soul to life, and light On that Eternal Sun set, fasten, fix thy sight. If you turn back on hellish Shades to pore, Thou ever losest what thou wan'st before: Thy soul more barr'd from Heav'n, in hell implunged more. Boetius. Libr. 2. Metr. 4. If safe thou wouldst, and quiet dwell, Refuse a Palace, chuse a cell. Wouldst thou burn out thy fenced light In peace, when winds, storms, tempests fight? Wouldst thou despise the curl'd-head waves, And laugh, when gaping Neptune raves? Let not thy house on mountains soar, Trust not the swilling, spewing shore. There envious winds, and spiteful blasts Reign, rage, and tear: there nothing lasts. Here sinking earth, and bibbing sands Betray the weight: here nothing stands. Climb not aloft to seek fresh ayer, Or pleasant seat: build sure, not fair. The lowly Rock make thy foundation; A strong, a lasting situtation. When thundring storms with ruins fill The pleasant shore, and mounting hill, Lodgd in thy trenches, safely lying, Fierce winds, and foming seas defying, Safe maist thou mock the angry skie, And quiet live, and quiet dy. Boetius. Libr. 3. Metr. 6. I The stock of man, the Root, the body, Boughs, (Whose breadth or'e-spreads the earth, height tops the skies) One Parent hath; he Sire, and Dam; he plowes, Plants, waters: he our birth, growth, all supplies. He fills the Sun with Seas of flowing beams; Surrounds, and drains the Moon with changing streams. II He peoples Seas with fish, the Heaven with Stars, Plants ayer, and earth with living Colonies. He pounds mans God-like Spirit in fleshly bars, And by that spirit earth to himself allies. Men are of high descent: their Petigree Mortals derive from great Eternitie. III Boast ye of Sires? and Grandsires? search ye earth For Heaven? Heavens Register will shew your race. Heavens King your Sire: from Heaven, in Heaven your birth A noble, royal line. No man is base But such, as for base earth Heavens birthright sell, By vice cut off from Heaven, and grafted into Hell. Boetius. Libr. 5. Metr. 5. I. Into what different moulds doth Gods wise hand Cast his wet clay? and to their various forms Their divers postures fitts? some sweep the sand Drawn out at length; as tottering boats in storms They mount, and fall, dragging their lazy trains They plow long furrowes on the dusty plains. II. Some (light as ayer) mounted on liquid sky Spread to the gentle winds their featherd sails; Swimming with plumed oars through Heavens fly: Some shod with hoofs, some frosted with sharp nails Through woods and forrests, plains, and mountains trace, And set their prints upon th' earths scarr'd face. III. Yet though their various shapes, and gate betray, How far their natures differ each from other, All meet in this: All gaze upon the clay From which they spring, and stare upon their Mother. Prest down with earthy Yoke, their dullard sight Pores on dark shades; they use, not view the light. IV. Man only rears aloft his honour'd head: His body stands, and walks upright: his eyes Transport his soul, where it was highly bred, To keep acquaintance with his neer Allies. On earth his down-cast look he never places, But when he stoops, and lofty head abases. V. If then thou art not beast, or earth; if man, Thy body guides the soul, thy eye the mind: Thy flesh looks where it tends, not wher't began, Oh shall the Heaven-born soul forget his kind? Shall heavenly minds mind earth? while earthy eyes Eye Heaven? soar up my soul: transcend the skies. Else while thy body lives, thy spirit dies. BRITTAIN'S IDA. Written by that Renoned PoÃ«t, Edmond Spencer. TO THE RIGHT Noble Lady MARY, Daughter to the most Illustrious Prince George, Duke of Buckingham. Martial. Accipe facundi culicem studiose Maronis, Ne nugis positis, arma virumque Canas. Se here that stately Muse, that erst could raise, In lasting numbers great Elizaes praise, And dresse faire Vertue in so rich attire, That even her Foes were forced to admire, And court her Heavenly beauty, shee that taught The Graces grace, and made the Vertues thought More vertuous then before, is pleased here, To slacke her serious flight, and feed your eare With loves delightsome toyes; doe not refuse These harmlesse sports; 't is learned Spencer's Muse; But thinke his loosest PoÃ«ms worthier then The serious follies of unskillfull men. Brittain's Ida. Cant. 1. The Argument. The youthly Shepheards wonning here, And Beauties rare displayd appeare: What exercise hee chiefe affects, His Name, and scornefull love neglects. 1 In Ida Vale (who knowes not Ida Vale?) When harmelesse Troy yet felt not GrÃ¦cian spite: A hundred Shepheards woon'd, and in the Dale, While their faire Flockes the three leav'd Pastures bite: The Shepheards boyes, with hundred sportings light, Gave winges unto the times to speedy hast: Ah foolish Lads, that strove with lavish wast, So fast to spend the time, that spends your time as fast. 2 Among the rest that all the rest excel'd, A dainty Boy there wonn'd, whose harmelesse yeares, Now in their freshest budding gently sweld; His Nimph-like face ne're felt the nimble sheeres, Youth's downy blossome through his cheeke appeares: His lovely limbes (but love he quite discarded) Were made for play (but he no play regarded,) And fit love to reward, and with love be rewarded. 3 High was his fore-head, arch't with silver mould, (Where never anger churlish rinkle dighted) His auburne lockes hung like darke threds of gold, That wanton aires (with their faire length incited) To play among their wanton curles delighted. His smiling eyes with simple truth were stor'd: Ah! how should truth in those thiefe eyes be stor'd, Which thousand loves had stol'n, and never one restor'd. 4 His lilly-cheeke might seeme an Ivory plaine, More purely white than frozen Apenine: Where lovely bashfulnesse did sweetely raine, In blushing scarlet cloth'd, and purple fine. A hundred hearts had this delightfull shrine, (Still cold it selfe) inflam'd with hot desire, That well the face might seeme, in divers tire, To be a burning snow, or else a freezing fire. 5 His cheerefull lookes, and merry face would proove, (If eyes the index be where thoughts are read) A dainty play-fellow for naked love; Of all the other parts enough is sed, That they were fit twins for so fayre a head: Thousand boyes for him, thousand maidens dy'de, Dye they that list, for such his rigorous pride, He thousand boyes (ah foole) and thousand maids deni'd. 6 His joy was not in musiques sweete delight, (Though well his hand had learnt that cunning arte) Or dainty songs to daintier eares indite; But through the plaines to chace the nimble Hart, With well tun'd hounds; or with his certaine dart, The tusked Boare, or savage Beare to wound; Meane time his heart with monsters doth abound, Ah foole to seeke so farre what neerer might be found! 7 His name (well knowne unto those Woody shades, Where unrewarded lovers oft complaine them) Anchises was; Anchises oft the glades, And mountaines heard Anchises had disdain'd them; Not all their love one gentle looke had gain'd them, That rockey hills, with echoing noyse consenting, Anchises plain'd; but he no whit relenting, (Harder then rocky hils) laught at their vaine lamenting. Cant. 2. The Argument. Diones Garden of delight, With wonder holds Anchises sight; While from the Bower such Musique sounds, As all his senses neere confounds. 1 One day it chanc't as hee the Deere persude, Tyred with sport, and faint with weary play, Faire Venus grove not farre away he view'd, Whose trembling leaves invite him there to stay, And in their shades his sweating limbes display: There in the cooling glade he softly paces, And much delighted with their even spaces, What in himselfe he scorn'd, hee prais'd their kinde imbraces. 2 The Woode with Paphian mirtles peopled, (Whose springing youth felt never Winters spiting) To laurels sweete were sweetely married, Doubling their pleasing smels in their uniting, When single much, much more when mixt delighting: No foote of beast durst touch this hallowed place, And many a boy that long'd the woods to trace, Entred with feare, but soone turn'd back his frighted face. 3 The thicke-lockt bowes shut out the tell-tale Sunne, (For Venus hated his all blabbing light, Since her knowne fault which oft she wisht undone) And scattered rayes did make a doubtfull sight, Like to the first of day, or last of night: The fittest light for Lovers gentle play; Such light best shewes the wandring lovers way, And guides his erring hand: Night is loves holly-day. 4 So farre in this sweete Labyrinth he stray'd, That now he viewes the Garden of delight; Whose breast, with thousand painted flowers array'd, With divers joy captiv'd his wandring sight; But soone the eyes rendred the eares their right: For such strange harmony he seem'd to heare, That all his senses flockt into his eare, And every faculty wisht to be seated there. 5 From a close Bower this dainty Musique flow'd, A Bower appareld round with divers Roses Both red and white; which by their liveries show'd Their Mistris faire, that there her selfe reposes: Seem'd that would strive with those rare Musique clozes, By spreading their faire bosomes to the light, Which the distracted sense should most delight; That, raps the melted eare; this, both the smel &amp; sight. 6 The Boy 'twixt fearefull hope, and wishing feare, Crept all along (for much he long'd to see The Bower, much more the guest so lodged there) And as he goes, he markes how well agree Nature and arte in discord unity: Each striving who should best performe his part, Yet arte now helping nature; nature arte: While from his eares a voyce thus stole [into] his heart. 7 Fond men, whose wretched care the life soone ending, By striving to i[n]crease your joy, do spend it; And spending joy, yet find no joy in spending: You hurt your life by striving to amend it, And seeking to prolong it, soonest end it: Than while fit time affords thee time and leasure, Enjoy while yet thou mayst thy lifes sweet pleasure: Too foolish is the man that starves to feed his treasure: 8 Love is lifes end (an end but never ending) All joyes, all sweetes, all happinesse awarding: Love is life[s] wealth (nere spent, but ever spending) More rich, by giving, taking by discarding: Love's lifes reward, rewarded in rewarding, Then from thy wretched heart fond care remoove; Ah should thou live but once loves sweetes to proove, Thou wilt not love to live, unlesse thou live to love. 9 To this sweete voyce, a dainty musique fitted Its well-tun'd strings; and to her notes consorted: And while with skilfull voyce the song she dittied, The blabbing Echo had her words retorted; That now the Boy, beyond his soule transported, Through all his limbes feeles run a pleasant shaking, And twixt a hope &amp; feare suspects mistaking, And doubts he sleeping dreames, &amp; broad awake feares waking. Cant. 3. The Argument. Faire Cythareas limbes beheld, The straying Lads heart so inthral'd: That in a Trance his melted spright, Leaves th' sences slumbring in delight. 1 Now to the Bower hee sent his thevish eyes, To steale a happy sight; there doe they finde Faire Venus, that within halfe naked lyes; And straight amaz'd (so glorious beauty shin'd) Would not returne the message to the minde: But full of feare, and superstitious awe, Could not retire, or backe their beames with-draw, So fixt on too much seeing made they nothing saw. 2 Her goodly length, stretch't on a Lilly-bed; (A bright foyle of a beauty farre more bright,) Few Roses round about were scattered, As if the Lillies learnt to blush for spite, To see a skinne much more then Lilly-white: The bed sanke with delight so to be pressed, And knew not which to thinke a chance more blessed, Both blessed so to kisse, and so agayne be kissed. 3 Her spacious fore-head like the clearest Moone, Whose full-growne Orbe begins now to be spent, Largely display'd in native silver shone, Giving wide roome to beauties Regiment, Which on the plaine with love tryumphing went: Her golden haire a rope of pearle imbraced, Which with their dainty threds oft times enlaced, Made the eie think the pearle was there in gold inchased. 4 Her full large eye, in jetty-blacke array'd, Prov'd beauty not confin'd to red and white, But oft her selfe in blacke more rich display'd; Both contraries did yet themselves unite, To make one beauty in different delight: A thousand loves sate playing in each eye, And smiling mirth kissing faire courtesie, By sweete perswasion wan a bloodlesse victory. 5 The whitest white set by her silver cheeke, Grew pale and wan like unto heavy lead: The freshest Purple fresher dyes must seeke, That dares compare with them his fainting red: On these Cupi[d]o winged armies led, Of little loves, that with bold wanton traine Under those colours, marching on the plaine, Force every heart, and to low vasselage constraine. 6 Her lips, most happy each in others kisses, From their so wisht imbracements seldome parted, Yet seem'd to blush at such their wanton blisses; But when sweete words their joyning sweet disparted, To th' eare a dainty musique they imparted: Upon them fitly sate delightfull smiling, A thousand soules with pleasing stealth beguiling: Ah that such shew's of joyes should be all joyes exiling? 7 The breath came slowly thence, unwilling leaving So sweet a lodge, but when she once intended, To feast the aire with words, the heart deceiving, More fast it thronged so to be expended; And at each word a hundred loves attended, Playing ith' breath, more sweete then is that firing, Where that Arabian onely bird expiring, Lives by her death, by losse of breath more fresh respiring. 8 Her chin, like to a stone in gold inchased, Seem'd a faire jewell wrought with cunning hand, And being double, doubly the face graced. This goodly frame on her round necke did stand, Such pillar well such curious worke sustain'd; And on his top the heavenly spheare up rearing, Might well present, with daintier appearing, A lesse but better Atlas, that faire heaven bearing. 9 Lower two breasts stand all their beauties bearing, Two breasts as smooth and soft; but ah alas! Their smoothest softnes farre exceedes comparing: More smooth and soft; but naught that ever was, Where they are first deserves the second place: Yet each as soft and each as smooth as other; And wh? thou first tri'st one &amp; th? the other, Each softer seemes then each, &amp; each then each seemes smoother. 10 Lowly betweene their dainty hemisphÃ¦res, (Their hemisphÃ¦res the heav'nly Globes excelling,) A path, more white then is the name it beares, The lacteall path conducts to the sweet dwelling, Where best delight all joyes sits freely dealing; Where hundred sweetes, and still fresh joyes attending; Receive in giving, and still love dispending, Grow richer by their losse, and wealthy by expending. 11 But stay bold shepheard, here thy footing stay, Nor trust too much unto thy n[e]w-borne quill, As farther to those dainty limbes to stray; Or hope to paint that vale, or beautious hill, Which past the finest hand and choycest skill: But were thy Verse and Song as finely fram'd, As are those parts, yet should it soone be blam'd, For now the shameless world of best things is asham'd. 12 That cunning Artist, that old Greece admir'd, Thus farre his Venus fitly portrayed; But there he left, nor farther ere aspir'd: His DÃ¦dale hand, that Nature perfected By arte, felt arte by nature limitted. Ah! well he knew, though his fit hand could give Breath to dead colours, teaching marble live, Yet would these lively parts his hand of skill deprive. 13 Such when this gentle boy her closly view'd, Onely with thinnest silken vaile o'er-layd, Whose snowy colour much more snowy shew'd, By being next that skin; and all betray'd, Which best in naked beauties are aray'd: His spirits melted with so glorious sight, Ran from their worke to see so splendent light, And left the fainting limbes sweet slumbring in delight. Cant. 4. The Argument. The swo[u]nding Swaine recovered is By th' Goddesse; his soule rapting blisse: There mutuÃ ll conference, and how Her service she doth him allow. 1 Soft-sleeping Venus waked with the fall, Looking behind, the sinking Boy espies, With all she starts, and wondereth withall, She thinkes that there her faire Adonis dyes, And more she thinkes the more the Boy she eyes: So stepping neerer, up begins to reare him; And now with love himselfe she will confer him, And now, before her love himselfe she will preferre him. 2 The Lad soone with that dainty touch reviv'd Feeling himselfe so well, so sweetly seated, Begins to doubt whether he yet here liv'd, Or else his flitting soule to heav'n translated, Was there in starry throne, and blisse instated: Oft would he dye, so to be often saved; And now with happy wish he closly craved, For ever to be dead, to be so sweet ingraved. 3 The Paphian Princesse (in whose lovely breast, Spitefull disdaine could never find a place) When now she saw him from his fit releast, (To Juno leaving wrath, and scolding base) Comforts the trembling Boy with smiling grace, But oh! those smiles (too full of sweete delight) Surfeit his heart, full of the former sight; So seeking to revive, more wounds his feeble sprite. 4 Tell me faire Boy (sayd she) what erring chance, Hither directed thy unwary pace: For sure contempt, or pride durst not advance Their foule aspect, in thy so pleasant face: Tell me, what brought thee to this hidden place? Or lacke of love, or mutuall answering fire, Or hindred by ill chance in thy desire: Tell me, what ist thy faire and wishing eyes require? 5 The Boy (whose sence was never yet acquainted With such a musique) stood with eares arected; And sweetly with that pleasant spell enchanted, More of those sugred straines long time expected, Till seeing she his speeches not rejected, First sighes arising from his hearts low center, Thus gan reply; when each word bold would venter, And strive the first, that dainty labyrinth to enter, 6 Faire Cyprian Queene (for well that heavenly face Prooves thee the mother of all conquering love) Pardon I pray thee my unweeting pace, For no presumptuous thoughts did hither moove My daring feete, to this thy holy Grove; But lucklesse chance (which if you not gaine-say, I still must rue) hath caus'd me here to stray, And lose my selfe (alas) in losing of my way. 7 Nor did I come to right my wronged fire, Never till now I saw what ought be loved, And now I see, but never dare aspire To moove my hope, where yet my love is mooved; Whence though I would, I would it not remooved: Onely since I have plac't my love so high, Which sure thou must, or sure thou wilt deny, Grant me yet still to love, though in my love to dye. 8 But shee that in his eyes Loves face had seene, And flaming heart, did not such suite disdaine, (For cruelty fits not sweete beauties Queene) But gently could his passion entertaine, Though she loves Princesse, he a lowly Swaine: First of his bold intrusion she acquites him; Then to her service (happy Boy) admits him; And like another love, with Bow and quiver fits him. 9 And now [with all] the loves he grew acquainted, And Cupids selfe, with his like face delighted, Taught him a hundred wayes with which he daunted The prouder hearts, and wronged lovers righted, Forcing to love, that most his love despited. And now the practique Boy did so approove him, And with such grace and cunning arte did moove him, That all the pritty loves, and all the Graces love him. Cant. 5. The Argument. The Lovers sad despairing plaints, Bright Venus with his love acquaints; Sweetly importun'd he doth shew, From whom proceedeth this his woe. 1 Yet never durst his faint and coward heart, (Ah foole! faint heart faire Lady ne're could win) Assaile faire Venus with his new-learnt arte, But kept his love, and burning flame within, Which more flam'd out, the more he prest it in: And thinki[n]g oft, how just shee might disdaine him; While some coole mirtle shade did entertaine him, Thus sighing would he sit, &amp; sadly would he plain him. 2 Ah fond, and haplesse Boy! nor know I whether, More fond, or haplesse more, that all so high Hast plac't thy heart, where love and fate together, May never hope to end thy misery, Nor yet thy selfe dare wish a remedy. All hindrances (alas) conspire to let it; Ah fond, and haplesse Boy! if canst not get it, In thinking to forget, at length learne to forget it. 3 Ah farre too fond, but much more haplesse Swaine! Seeing thy love can be forgotten never. Serve and observe thy love with willing paine; And though in vaine thy love thou doe persever, Yet all in vaine doe thou adore her ever. No hope can crowne thy thoughts so farre aspiring, Nor dares thy selfe desire thine owne desiring, Yet live thou in her love, and dye in her admiring. 4 Thus oft the hopelesse Boy complayning lyes; But she that well could guesse his sad lamenting, (Who can conceale love from loves mothers eyes?) Did not disdaine to give his love contenting: Cruell the soule, that feedes on soules tormenting: Nor did she scorne him though not nobly borne, (Love is nobility) nor could she scorne, That with so noble skill her title did adorne. 5 One day it chanc't, thrice happy day and chance! While loves were with the Graces sweetly sporting, And to fresh musique sounding play and dance; And Cupids selfe with Shepheards boyes consorting, Laught at their pritty sport, and simple courting: Faire Venus seates the fearefull Boy close by her, Where never PhÅbus Jealous lookes might eye her, And bids the Boy his Mistris, and her name descry her. 6 Long time the youth bound up in silence stood, While hope and feare with hundred thoughts begun, Fit Prologue to his speech; and fearefull blood From heart and face, with these post-tydings runne, That eyther now he's made, or now undone: At length his trembling words, with feare made weake, Began his too long silence thus to breake, While from his humble eies first reverence seem'd to speake. 7 Faire Queene of Love, my life thou maist command, Too slender price for all thy former grace, Which I receive at thy so bounteous hand; But never dare I speake her name and face; My life is much lesse-priz'd than her disgrace: And, for I know if I her name relate, I purchase anger, I must hide her state, Unlesse thou sweare by stix I purchase not her hate. 8 Faire Venus well perceiv'd his subtile shift, And swearing gentle patience, gently smil'd: While thus the Boy persu'd his former drift: No tongue was ever yet so sweetely skil'd, Nor greatest Orator so highly stil'd; Though helpt [with all] the choisest artes direction, But when he durst describe her heav'ns perfection, By his imperfect praise, disprais'd his imperfection. 9 Her forme is as her selfe, perfect CÃ¦lestriall, No mortall spot her heavenly frame disgraces: Beyond compare; such nothing is terrestriall; More sweete then thought or pow'rfull wish embraces, The map of heaven; the summe of all the Graces. But if you wish more truely limb'd to eye her, Than fainting speech, or words can well descry her, Look in a glasse, &amp; there more perfect you may spy her. Cant. 6. The Argument. The Boyes short wish, her larger grant, That doth his soule with blisse enchant: Whereof impatient uttering all, Inraged Jove contrives his thrall. 1 Thy crafty arte (reply'd the smiling Queene) Hath well my chiding, and [h]ot rage prevented, Yet might'st thou thinke, that yet 'twas never seene, That angry rage, and gentle love consented: But if to me thy true love is presented, What wages for thy service must I owe thee? For by the selfe same vow, I here avow thee, What ever thou require, I frankly will allow thee. 2 Pardon (replies the Boy) for so affecting, Beyond mortallity; and not discarding, Thy service was much more than my expecting; But if thou (more thy bounty-hood regarding) Wilt needes heape up reward upon rewarding; Thy love I dare not aske, or mutuall fi[r]ing, One kisse is all my love, and prides aspiring, And after starve my heart, for my too much desiring. 3 Fond Boy! (sayd she) too fond that askt no more; Thy want by taking is no whit decreased, And giving, spends not our increasing store: Thus with a kisse, his lips she sweetly pressed; Most blessed kisse; but hope more than most blessed, The Boy did thinke heaven fell while thus he joy'd; And while joy he so greedily enjoy'd, He felt not halfe his joy by being over-joy'd. 4 Why sighst faire Boy? (sayd she) dost thou repent thee Thy narrow wish in such straight bonds to stay? Well may I sigh (sayd he) and well lament me, That never such a debt may hope to pay: A kisse (sayd she) a kisse will backe repay: Wilt thou (reply'd the Boy too much delighted) Content thee, with such pay to be requited? She grants; &amp; he his lips, heart, soule, to payment cited. 5 Looke as a Ward, long from his Lands detain'd, And subject to his Guardians cruel lore, Now spends the more, the more he was restrain'd, So he; yet though in laying out his store, He doubly takes; yet findes himselfe grow poore: With that, he markes, and tels her out a score, And doubles them, and trebles all before: Fond Boy! the more thou paist, thy debt still grows the more. 6 At length, whether these favours so had fir'd him, With kindly heate, inflaming his desiring; Or whether those sweete kisses had inspir'd him; Hee thinkes that some thing wants for his requiring; And still aspires, yet knows not his aspiring: But yet though that hee knoweth, so she gave, That he presents himselfe her bounden slave; Stil his more wishing face seem'd some what else to crave. 7 And boldned with successe and many graces, His hand, chain'd up in feare, he now releast: And asking leave, courag'd with her imbraces; Againe it prison'd in her tender breast; Ah blessed prison! prisners too much blest! There with those sisters long time doth he play; And now full boldly enters loves high way; While downe the pleasant vale, his creeping hand doth stray. 8 She not displeased with this his wanton play, Hiding his blushing with a sugred kisse; With such sweete heat his rudenesse doth allay, That now he perfect knowes what ever blisse, Elder love taught, and he before did misse: That moult with joy, in such untri'd joyes trying, He gladly dies; and death new life applying, Gladly againe he dyes, that oft he may be dying. 9 Long thus he liv'd, slumbring in sweete delight, Free from sad care, and fickle worlds annoy; Bathing in liquid joyes his melted sprite; And longer mought, but he (ah foolish Boy!) Too proud, and to impatient of his joy, To woods, and heav'n, and earth his blisse imparted; That Jove upon him downe his thunder darted, Blasting his splendent face, and all his beauty swarted. 10 Such be his chance, that to his love doth wrong, Unworthy he to have so worthy place, That cannot hold his peace and blabbing tongue: Light joyes float on his lips, but rightly grace Sinckes deepe, and th' hearts low center doth imbrace: Might I enjoy my love till I unfold it, I'de lose all favours when I blabbing told it: He is not fit for love, that is not fit to hold it.
