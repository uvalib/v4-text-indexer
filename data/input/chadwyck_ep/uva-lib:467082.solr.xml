      <field name="fulltext">TO HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN. 1837—1887 When God enthroned You, fifty years ago, And the grey Dukes in homage would have knelt, You rose up to prevent them, blushing— “No, I am your niece Victoria!” England felt Her heart beat; England loved You! It was good So great a Queen should be a girl so true! Madam, these Realms praise God—and reverence You— For Fifty Years of Sovereign Womanhood. A LOST EPIC. This is his little grandchild! . . . Run away, And pluck the gentleman a bunch of flowers! A pretty tot! Poem he never wrote To match in freshness and in winning grace That rosy little slip of roguery! Here are his poems—all he gave the world— A crown octavo, thin and printed wide— Forgotten now, but forty years ago Noted with wonder as a new-seen star, Deemed sweet as snowdrops after months of snow, And simple as snowdrops too! He prized them not— “The babble o' green fields in his feverish youth; Mere chirps and fluted trills—because the earth Was sunny and blossom-blithe, and but to live A very joy;” for he'd outgrown the broad Untutored heart of homely man and maid, And, heedless of the common work-day life Which prompts the poems all the world can feel, Could scorn the only pages left to keep His name in kindly memory. Take the book; And since I prize his gift—no doubt, no doubt!— Still, have a more than special care of this! Four years ago he came and brought the child, A prattling three-year-old, and lived alone— An aged maid for housekeeper and nurse— In yon small cottage, where the beechwood shrinks From over-keen blown kisses of the sea. A tall, mild, wise-eyed, silver-bearded man— The sea-wind scattering down our village street His sixtieth autumn's crimson leaves—he moved Among us, noting all our seaboard ways, Stealing our little people's hearts with sweets, And through the children winning all the wives; But when the men, rough storm-flushed fellows, smiled With slightly pitying, half-amused contempt, Their homespun wits he startled to respect By better knowledge of the things they knew, Till all our ale-house sages, pipe in cheek, Confessed “the Doctor” knew a sight o' things Beyond their weather-gage, and last of all Our gaunt old whaler, ear-ringed and tattooed, Bragged less of outland folk and foreign ports. Nay, I, too, when the gracious Sunday bell Gathered our village—little children all Around a common knee—began to feel An undefined attraction to the man, And found my sermon three-parts preached to him; While he, with reverend hair and solemn beard, A sprig or flower-bud at his button-hole, Would sit, his grandchild's tiny hand in his, Listening and musing,—musing most, I thought,— Patient if not improved, until the close. I came to like the man—who liked him not?— And watched his tall grey figure as he passed Seaward along the bright side of the street,— Wee flax-head trotting gaily at his side In crimson cloak and buckled crimson shoes;— Watched, and surprised him on the breezy downs Poring through lenses o'er the silvery frost Of lichens on some ice-scored boulder-stone, And oft at sunset met, a furlong off, His spare stretched shadow on the glittering sands, And then himself—the little one asleep, Nestled in flaxen hair and hoary beard. The village folk, with that blank bovine stare Which never seems to see the thing it scans, Observed and gossiped, wondered, and surmised, But found no evil in the lonely man Whose life seemed wholly bound up in his child; And, tired of vain conjecture, grew content To love him merely, and let him hold his way Mysterious and unquestioned. So the year From autumn round to autumn rolled; and then, Whether it were he felt the social need Or simply liked me out of liberal heart, The Doctor lost his strangeness and reserve, At length cast all the anchors of his trust, Nor found me lack that gracious temper of youth Which worships lofty aims in patient lives. A poet, heart and brain, the man but lived To write one book which no man yet had dared; One life-work, one colossal poem, fraught With all the joy and travail of mankind, Enriched with all the lore of all the years— “The Epic of the Pageants of the World.” Smiling, 'twas so he named it for the nonce; And truly as he sat in dreamy mood And sketched the vasty outlines of his theme, I, grown from very sympathy a bard, Saw, as he spoke, strange masquerades of Time Sweep past in awful splendour. Years had fled, Ay, forty years of florid life, since first He planned this large majestic epopee; And years must still be spent in search and thought; And years, perchance, in waiting, sail outspread, To catch the ever-imminent breeze of song; Years on the voyage through that sea of dreams; Years—and the man who had thought and wrought, too rapt To note the years, forgot that he was old! Small wonder! For his eye, grown keen to scan The cosmic cycles from the nebular dawn, Was dulled to human epochs, mortal dates. Why, Rome was thatched and fenced but yesterday! The Pyramids were reared—a year ago? Nay, mark, those fiery-blossomed weeds have flamed Along the furrows of an Aryan plough; These ripples wash the self-same water-line As when the dwellers on the reed-roofed piles Moulded clay crescents of the holy Moon! What pageants these of his! He spoke of Art;— And the sea-crinkled, ice-cragged, palm-plumed world Spread like a marvellous map before the eye; And vaguely seen in dimly shimmering light, Lo! Man the Artist wrought. Before his cave Th' autochthon sketched upon a mammoth's tooth The picture of a mammoth, chipped the flint To shape of prehistoric man or beast. Tribes perished, forests crumbled, sea and land Changed places, and the stars changed colour and place In changing skies, but Man the Artist lived— Scratched, whittled, painted, grew in eye and hand; Pictured the river-bluffs, the rocky walls Of sea-carved creeks, the snow-capped precipice, The ice-borne boulder on the tropic isle, Till sun and moon, fish, reptile, bird and flower, Mammal and Man, on ivory, slate, horn, rock, Ringed with strange zodiacs all the savage globe! And nations perished, cities rose and fell, And Man the Artist lived and wrought and throve, Grew bold in thought and opulent in means, Survived all wreck, till Titian, Raphael came— For life indeed is short and art is long! All this was but an episode—conceive!— In some transcendent pageant he had named “The Song of Colour.” He began his strain Far backward in the green Devonian Age, When no bright blossom hung on any tree Its crimson petals or its golden bell; No single fruit gleamed ruddy in the sun, But all the jungle-waste of primal growth, Gigantic marestails, ferns, and ancient pines, Rolled one susurrent sea of endless green; And giant May-flies poised on gauzy wing O'er tepid swamps, and antique grasshoppers Chirruped the oldest music of the world. Threading that green and gloomy forest floor, He marked, as emerald age succeeded age, The slowly kindling dawn of sylvan love; The pines and cycads sighed with tender need, The grasses beckoned with their feathery plumes, And whispered, “Hasten, sweetest, or we die.” And through the woods for centuries the wind Drifted the amorous pollen, till the waste Was checked by Colour, and th' instinctive tree Hung out its lamps of blossom, wooed and won The aid of myriad-murmuring insect swarms In the vast stress and strain of leafy life;— Hung out its glowing fruit, that beast and bird Might guard its life, assist its kindly race In conquest of the hungry continents. So kindled through the centuries the world! For love of brilliant food awoke a love For brilliant mates; and beetle and butterfly Changed into creeping gem and fluttering flower, And feather and fur were shot with luring tints; And plucking from the hospitable boughs A coloured feast, the ancestry of Man Bequeathed to Man the love of coloured things, And Man became the Artist. Such he deemed The genesis of Art—so vast the time, So slow and subtly intricate the toil, Ere God could make a Raphael! Ponder that! Sublime it was but sad, this tardy growth, This infinite waste of means to shape an end, This frigid scorn of time, this recklessness Of life potential and of potent life. Nature, he felt, was ruthless, tyrannous, Extravagant of pain; and in a song, Blossom and Babe, he touched the human stop In the vast organ-music of his theme. Blossom and Babe. O happy little English cot! O rustic-sweet vignette Of red brick walls and thatchèd roof, in appleblossom set! O happy Devon meadows, how you come to me again! And I am riding as I rode along the cool green lane, A-dreaming and a-dreaming; and behold! I see once more The fair young mother with her babe beside the shaded door. How bright it was! No blossom trembled in the hot blue noon, And grasshoppers were thrilling all the drowsy heart of June! O babe upon the bosom, O blossom on the tree! And as I passed, the stridulous incessant jangle ran Along the hedgerow following me, until my brain began To mingle in a waking dream the baby at the breast, The woman and the apple-bloom, the shrilly sounding pest,— To blend them with that great green age of trees which never shed A bell of gold or purple or a petal of white or red, When all the music of the world—a world too young to sing— Was such a piercing riot made by such an insect wing. O babe upon the bosom, O blossom on the tree! And then I thought of all the ages, all the waste of power, That went to tinge one pulpy fruit, to flush one little flower; And just in this same wise, I mused, the Human too must grow Through waste of life, through blood and tears, through centuries of woe, To reach the perfect—flower and fruit; for Nature does not scan, More than the individual tree, the individual man; A myriad blossoms shall be lavished, if but one shall give The onward impulse to the thought that Nature means to live. O babe upon the bosom, O blossom on the tree! O fair young mother, far removed from visions of unrest, Be happy in the baby blossom flushing at thy breast! The blesseder condition thine, that thou canst never see The strife, the cruel waste, the cyclic growth in man and tree; That thou canst trust a heart, more kind than ever Nature shows, Will gather each baby bloom that falls, will cherish each that blows; Canst need no solace from the faith, that since the world began The Brute hath reached the Human through the martyrdom of man. O babe upon the bosom, O blossom on the tree! Why should I tire you with his dreams? And yet To me they bring the saddest hours I know. His pageant of migrations—swarming hosts Of plant, beast, insect, man, in ceaseless march Netting with footprints all the restless world Age after age; his vision of the tombs— Caves, barrows, rings and avenues of stone, Ship-mounds and pyramids, by sea-washed shore, Far inland, by the river, in the waste, On snow-peaked mountain and on grassy plain, On continent and isle, here one all lone, There grouped in multitudes, till all the earth Seemed one vast graveyard whence the Spirit of Man Cried unto God for immortality; His pageant of the altars—yearning arms Stretched to the spirits of the kindly dead, The blood-drenched idols and the shrieking fires, The magic drums—why speak of these, of aught? The song of Blossom and Babe was all he wrote Of this stupendous Epic of the World. Last spring he died, left me his grandchild there, His fossils, books, and manuscripts. The last I searched with eagerness, and found the song— A single arrow-head in heaps of flakes, Notes, observations, comments, chips of thought! His heart was light unto the last: he felt A joyous confidence that all was well. No premonition saddened his decline; And, dying, he believed in years of love To lavish on his poem and his child. The mighty Epic that had filled his brain, Absorbed his very being forty years, He took away with him. A larger life May yield it larger utterance—who can tell? Yes, give them to the gentleman, my dear! THE DEATH OF ANAXAGORAS. “Lampsacum postea profectus, illic diem suum obiit; ubi rogantibus eum principibus civitatis, Numquid fieri mandaret, jussisse ferunt ut pueri quotannis quo mense defecisset ludere permitterentur, servarique et hodie consuetudinem.”—Diog. Laert. De Vita Philosoph.; Anaxagoras. Cleon of Lampsacus to Pericles:— Of him she banished now let Athens boast; Let now th' Athenians raise to him they stoned A statue;—Anaxagoras is dead! To you who mourn the Master, called him friend, Beat back th' Athenian wolves who fanged his throat, And risked your own to save him,—Pericles— I now unfold the manner of his end. The aged man, who found in sixty years Scant cause for laughter, laughed before he died And died still smiling:—Athens vexed him not! Not he, but your Athenians, he would say, Were banished in his exile! When the dawn First glimmers white o'er Lesser Asia, And little birds are twittering in the grass, And all the sea lies hollow and grey with mist, And in the streets the ancient watchmen doze, The Master woke with cold. His feet were chill And reft of sense; and we who watched him knew The fever had not wholly left his brain, For he was wandering, seeking nests of birds— An urchin from the green Ionian town Where he was born. We chafed his clay-cold limbs; And so he dozed, nor dreamed, until the sun Laughed out—broad day—and flushed the garden gods Who bless our fruits and vines in Lampsacus. Feeble, but sane and cheerful, he awoke And took our hands and asked to feel the sun; And where the ilex spreads a gracious shade We placed him, wrapped and pillowed; and he heard The charm of birds, the social whisper of vines, The ripple of the blue Propontic sea. Placid and pleased he lay;—but we were sad To see the snowy hair and silver beard Like withering mosses on a fallen oak, And feel that he, whose vast philosophy Had cast such sacred branches o'er the fields Where Athens pastures her dull sheep, lay fallen And never more should know the spring! Confess, You too had grieved to see it, Pericles! But Anaxagoras owned no sense of wrong; And when we called the plagues of all your gods On your ungrateful city, he but smiled: “Be patient, children! Where would be the gain Of wisdom and divine astronomy, Could we not school our fretful minds to bear The ills all life inherits? I can smile To think of Athens! Were they much to blame? Had I not slain Apollo? Plucked the beard Of Jove himself? Poor rabble, who have yet Outgrown so little the green grasshoppers From whom they boast descent,—are they to blame? How could they dream,—or how believe when taught— The sun a red-hot iron ball, in bulk Not less than Peloponnesus? How believe The moon, no silver goddess girt for chace, But earth and stones, with caverns, hills, and vales? Poor grasshoppers! who deem the gods absorbed In all their babble, shrilling in the grass, What wonder if they rage, should one but hint That thunder and lightning, born of clashing clouds, Might happen even with Jove in pleasant mood,— Not thinking of Athenians at all!” He paused; and blowing softly from the sea, The fresh wind stirred the ilex, shaking down Through chinks of sunny leaves blue gems of sky; And lying in the shadow, all his mind O'ershadowed by our grief, once more he spoke:— “Let not your hearts be troubled! All my days Hath all my care been fixed on this vast blue So still above us; now my days are done, Let it have care of me! Be patient; meek; Not puffed with doctrine! Nothing can be known; Nought grasped for certain; sense is circumscribed; The intellect is weak; and life is short!” He ceased and mused a little, while we wept. “And yet be nowise downcast; seek, pursue; The lover's rapture and the sage's gain Less in attainment lie than in approach. Look forward to the time which is to come! All things are mutable; and change alone Unchangeable. But knowledge grows! The gods Are drifting from the earth like morning mist; The days are surely at the doors when men Shall see but human actions in the world! Yea, even these hills of Lampsacus shall be The isles of some new sea, if time not fail!” And now the reverend fathers of our town Had heard the Master's end was very near, And came to do him homage at the close, And ask what wish of his they might fulfil. But he, divining that they thought his heart Might yearn to Athens for a resting-place, Said gently: “Nay, from everywhere the way To that dark land you wot of is the same. I feel no care; I have no wish. The Greeks Will never quite forget my Pericles, And when they think of him will say of me, 'Twas Anaxagoras taught him!” Loath to go, No kindly office done, yet once again The reverend fathers pressed him for a wish. Then laughed the Master: “Nay, if still you urge, And since 'twere churlish to reject goodwill, I pray you, every year when time brings back The month in which I left you, let the boys— All boys and girls in this your happy town— Be free of task and school for that one month.” He lay back smiling, and the reverend men Departed, heavy at heart. He spoke no more, But haply musing on his truant days, Passed from us, and was smiling when he died. Thus wrote to Pericles from Lampsacus The poet Cleon; and the Master's words, Wherein he spoke of change unchangeable, Hold good for great things but hold ill for small; For lo! six hundred fateful years have sped And Greece is but a Roman province now, Whereas through those six centuries, year by year When summer and the sun brought back the time, The lads and lasses, free of task and school, Have held their revelry in Lampsacus,— A fact so ripe with grave moralities, That I, Diogenes, have deemed it fit To note in my “De Vita et Moribus.” MORNING. Oh, glad and red, the light of morn Across the field of battle broke, And showed the waste of trampled corn And smouldering farmsteads wrapped in smoke; And cold and stark the soldier lay, Shot down beside his shattered gun; And, grimly splashed with blood and clay, His face looked ghastly in the sun. Oh, glad and red, the morning shone In happy England far away, Where knelt a bright-haired little one Beside her mother's knee to pray; And prompting each fond faltering word, The soldier's wife was glad and smiled— She knew not 'twas a widow heard The prattle of an orphan child. Oh, glad and red, oh, glad and red The morning light glowed everywhere: And one beam touched the father dead, And one the child who knelt in prayer; And from the trampled corn and clay— A skylark sprang with joyous breast— For shot and shell had spared that day Its four brown eggs and little nest. THE LEGEND OF THE ARK. I.—THE GREAT WITNESS. “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth. . . . And it repented the Lord that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air.” Lo! sixteen centuries had passed away! When God drove forth the pair, they fell a prey To darkness and the panic of the night. On three sides crouched their dread. In front, a light— A fire—a sword smote every way to keep The Tree of Life. Their terror made them creep Nearer the sword. They maddened to escape The horror without hands and without shape That lurked in nature, waiting them. The twain Crept closer. 'Twere less dreadful to be slain By that fierce splendour, in each other's sight, Than perish in the vast unhuman night. They lay beneath the sword; they felt the wind It made. This Man and Woman were mankind. The sword showed him the Woman's face, showed her The Man's. They shrank apart. Their faces were More fearful than the darkness, than the sword. Then God in pity gave them fire; the Lord Gave them the fire for solace and a stay. When sixteen hundred years had passed away The whole earth was fulfilled of evil and woe. The Man and Woman wandered to and fro In hordes and tribes and nations. They did eat Of every beast and tree. The track of feet Lay wide through polar snow and tropic sand. No ocean beat on any utmost land But some wild fisher watched the heaving blue. Tribes thronged the sunset and the dawn. They knew The glow of arctic and antarctic skies. In savage lands they lived in wolfish wise. The tree, the hanging rock, the cavern gave Shelter for fire and slumber—and a grave. Time changed them—colour and stature, hair and skin. They knew not whence they came. They owned no kin. The Man and Woman in them had forgot All ancient days, the sad primeval lot, The brotherhood of dust, the sword of fire. Their god was hunger, and their law desire. In ancient realms, from golden cities, bright With lamps of revel, roared into the night The orgies of the giants of the earth. And men and beasts, by day, to make them mirth, Slew and were slain. Their spearmen, early and late, Drove virgin troops from every land to sate The tigerish greed of their delirious lust. The evil of their fame was blown, like dust— A blinding drouth—through all the world's broad ways. And they too had forgot the olden days, The kinship of mankind, the sword of fire. Their god was luxury, their law desire. Between the cities and the savage waste Were men in myriads. These were they who chased The elephant and ostrich; they who fed On marrow of lions on the watershed Of mighty rivers; they who lived on canes And locusts; they who roamed in sail-drawn wains With flocks and herds, and made the heavens their fold; And serpent-eaters, wearing coils of gold; And fisher-folk, who slept on rafts of logs, And throve on river-fish and milk of dogs; And last, in regions green with sun and rain, The husbandmen who planted roots and grain, And dwelt in huts of water-reeds and mud. And all these had forgot the brotherhood Of man, the Garden days, the sword of fire. Their god was turbulence, their law desire. And now, when after sixteen hundred years, Beneath the whole wide heaven men's blood and tears Cried out to God; and God the Lord looked forth And saw the violence that filled the earth, The bloody worship and lascivious glee Around the boulder and beneath the tree, And all men's wickedness, it grieved the Lord That He had made man's image. He abhorred All flesh on earth, both man and creeping thing, And every beast, and bird of every wing. And God prepared the vengeance of His rain To slay them, that all evil might be slain And utterly destroyed before His face. But Noah, who had walked with God, found grace— Both Noah and his house. And Noah hewed Great trees within the forest, gopher-wood; And mighty oxen travailed through the years To draw the timber home. In all men's ears The fame of this and Noah's name made mirth. But lo! an ancient of the morn o' the earth— Hoary as winter, imperishable as stone, O'ershadowing as a cloud which all alone Glooms half a realm for half a summer day— Leaned on his spear, and watched his grandson lay The Ark's foundations. This was that sublime Presentment of humanity and time, Methuselah—the living man, whose eyes Had seen the living Adam. Centuries And nations near the figure of his life Were dwarfed to pigmy images. A strife Of wrath and sorrow raged within his mind. He felt himself the conscience of mankind— God's evidence against man's evil. Lo! Like God he knew if God were just or no. His memory was an iron book wherein Was graved a thousand years of human sin— A thousand years of patience, mercy, love, Outraged and scorned. “Ye clouds, grow great above; Be swift, ye waters, to obey his nod; Break, thou great deep, and rain, thou rain of God!” Thus spoke he in his wrath, yet while he spoke, The motherhood of Eve within him woke. What man was he that he should curse the race Her breasts had suckled! Down his rugged face The great tears of a world-wide pity ran. All time and all good men in that one man Seemed weeping. Day by day for many years That hoary Sorrow, gazing through his tears, Watched the long toil, nor spoke to any one. But when at last th' enormous work was done, And all the Ark was wrought, on that same day They saw the man's vast stature rock and sway, Then fall his length. Without a cry or groan He fell. He fell, as falleth some high stone Pillared for worship as a god, and hurled Headlong by God. God took him from a world All evil ere the doom of evil burst. One grief was spared him—he who had seen the first Saw not the last o' the race no prayer could save. The sons of Noah dug his giant grave. II.—THE PENITENT. “For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth. . . . And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life: . . . and the Lord shut him in.” God shut him in. If some great angel came By night or day, in wind or cloud or flame; Or God Himself leaned out of heaven to close The refuge of the Ark—no mortal knows. God shut him in. The Lord God sealed his door. Whom God shuts in is safe for evermore. For yet seven days did God the Lord restrain The vengeance of the deep and of the rain. There was a noise of viols in the earth, Eating and drinking, pomp and bridal mirth, And violence, and cries of captives sold, And worshippings of stone and wood and gold. Through all the golden cities, the unholy; Through regions of broad rivers winding slowly; To savage mountain-gorge and far-off strand Strange rumours spread, how forth of every land, From under every star and cloud, there came Innumerable creatures—wild and tame, Known and unnamable; hordes, flocks, flights, swarms; An endless pageant of bewildering forms And wondrous colours; monstrous and minute; Grotesque, ferocious, lovely; beast and brute, Bird, reptile, insect, mollusc; life in fur And life in feather, leather, horny bur, And shell, and hair, and scales. For many days Their myriad-marching clouded distant ways With dust, and filled the land with hoarse wild sound. Men marvelled; but of all not one was found To read the portent or to heed the sign. But lust o' the eyes and frolic born of wine Led forth one wanton rout to hear and see— Princes and captains riding royally; Lewd girls with tinkling feet and jewelled ears; And singing-men; archers and men with spears; And in the midst one Woman, tall and white— Beautiful, wondrous—splendid as a light On some black headland, when the sea-folk make High beacons in the darkness for the sake Of their sweet goddess-maid, the Moon. Behold! This was that mightiest Harlot of the old Corrupted earth before the great Flood came. Enchantment fell on those who heard her name; Her eyes made mad; the breath of her desire Was wild as wind, inexorable as fire. Man knew no shame who gazed upon her face. She broke the giants in the fierce embrace Of her white limbs, laughing for amorousness. The young men were as grapes beneath the press; She crushed their youth, and flung the skins away. Laughing, she came with all that lewd array, And stared with mocking eyes upon the Ark. Around, the ancient woods were hushed and dark. The Ark was closed. No cry of beast or bird Was heard within. No stir, no sound was heard. Hushed were the heavens, and dark with brooding cloud. The stillness smote her heart. She called aloud And bade them smite the Ark. The soldier's spear Thundered. Then all was still. Deep awe and fear Fell on the Woman's soul. They smote once more And beat upon the walls and sealèd door. But no one answered. Not a sound was heard. The dark heavens whist. No leaf o' the forest stirred. The Woman felt her limbs grow heavy as stone. She bade her people leave her there alone. She watched them go; with scared dilated eyes She followed them beneath the lowering skies, And saw them riding far across the land. She turned and struck the door with trembling hand, And listened trembling. “Man within,” she cried, “Answer; I am alone.” No voice replied. Then plucked she from her brows the moon, and tore Her dyed attire; and, beating on the door, Shrieked: “Answer, answer, answer!” All was still. The awful silence made her being thrill. She gathered dust and strewed it on her hair, And, striking hands together in despair, Shrieked: “Speak, ere terror blabs abroad my shame, For dread hath seized on me.” No answer came. Then from the Woman rose a piercing cry: “Hear, earth; ye heavens, hearken! here am I, The world's great Harlot, who have snared and slain The last old giants of the seed of Cain, And reddened all my robes with youthful blood. And now the Lord will chase me with His flood, And hunt me as a beast; and though He spare The beast, will spare not me, but clutch my hair, And slay me without mercy for my sin! I came to mock thee, O thou man within, But fear hath fallen upon me. Now I know That anguish and unutterable woe And sure destruction are at hand.” No sound Was heard, save bitter weeping on the ground, Where, sobbing with her face among the dust, The Harlot moaned: “The Lord is just—is just!” Then spoke a voice, gentle, compassionate: “Why weepest thou?” “Because it is too late.” “It never is too late to mourn for sin.” “Then open.” “Nay, the Lord hath shut me in.” “Must I then perish?” “Nay, thy flesh alone Shall for thine evil in the flesh atone!” There was a noise of viols in the earth: Eating and drinking, pomp, and bridal mirth. But day and night the Harlot, weeping sore, Crouched in the dust before the sealèd door. III.—THE VOICES. “And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; . . . and the mountains were covered. And all flesh died, . . . and every man: . . . and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.” The air was filled with sound of rain; the ground With sound of water; and amid the sound Were heard two awful Voices. “Look!” one cried; “What see'st thou?” And the other Voice replied: “The smoke of tumbling waters; rain that smites The waters into smoke. Upon the heights Crowding and flight and tumult—beasts and men.” “What is it thou canst see? Look forth again.” “I see a marble temple, white and fair. The black waves lash the steps. In mad despair The priests are flinging to the roaring sea Their gods of gold and silver. Now they flee; They seek the clefts o' the rocks. They flee, they seek Refuge from rocky cleft and rugged peak. They howl with terror.” “Look yet forth again. What see'st thou?” “A smoking crater; haggard men. Each glares at each with red and wolfish eyes. They cast their lots, for still the waters rise.” “Forbear; no more!” “Now look. What see'st thou?” “Lo! A single summit, hoar with ice and snow; No other land. The vast sea rolls beneath. A tigress, with her cub between her teeth, Stands on the summit panting, wild with fear.” “Yet once again. What dost thou see or hear?” “Drifting of giant clouds; encircling sea; Great waves; a raft of tree made fast to tree; Upon the raft a man. The man in rage Hath gnawed his flesh his famine to assuage.” “What doth the man?” “He sits with covered head.” “Is the man weeping?” “Lord, the man is dead.” “What see'st thou now?” “Sky, sea; betwixt the twain, The Ark.” “Doth any living thing remain?” “Not one of all that Thou didst make of yore.” The awful Voice responded: “Look no more!” IV.—THE WATERS. “And he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot.” Around the globe one wave, from pole to pole, Rolled on, and found no shore to break its roll. One awful water mirrored everywhere The silent, blue, illimitable air; And glassed at one same hour the midnight moon, Sunrise, and sunset, and the sun at noon. Beneath the noontide sun 'twas still as death. Within the dawn no living thing drew breath. Beneath the cold white moon the cold blue wave Sealed with an icy hush the old world's grave. But, hark! upon the sunset's edge were heard, Afar and faint, the cries of beast and bird. Afar, between the sunset and the dark, The lions had awakened in the Ark. Across the great red splendour white wings flew, Weary of wandering where no green leaf grew; Weary of searching for that unfound shore From which the Raven had returned no more. And as the white wings laboured slowly back, And down the huge orb sank, a speck of black Stood fluttering in the circle of the sun,— While the long billows, passing one by one, Lifted and lowered in the crimson blaze A dead queen of the old and evil days. One gold-clasped arm lay beautiful and bare; The gold of power gleamed in her floating hair; Her jewelled raiment in the glassy swell Glittered; and ever as she rose and fell, And o'er his reddened claws the ripple broke, The Raven fluttered with uneasy croak. TWO LIVES. Among the lonely hills they played; No other bairns they ever knew; A little lad, a little maid, In sweet companionship they grew. They played among the ferns and rocks A childish comedy of life— Kept house and milked the crimson docks, And called each other man and wife. They went to school; they used to go With arms about each other laid; Their flaxen heads, in rain or snow, Were sheltered by a single plaid. And so—and so it came to pass They loved each other ere they knew; His heart was like a blade o' grass, And hers was like its drap o' dew. The years went by; the changeful years Brought larger life and toil for life; They parted in the dusk with tears— They called each other man and wife. They married—she another man, And he in time another maid; The story ends as it began;— Among the lonely hills—they played!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WAYSIDE VIGNETTES. A DESERTED GARDEN. A highroad white with the dust of May; An old red wall, and an iron gate; A scent of Spring-time: a blossomy spray, Thrown over and bowed by the blossom's weight. An empty house, and a garden-ground That no one tended! The flowering trees Had grown half wild. With a revel of sound The birds in flocks made merry at ease. The gravelled pathways were blurred with green; The flower-beds each into other had run; 'Twas all one ferment of colour and sheen, And scent and song, in the glittering sun. And yet the place had a rueful look For lack of laughter and pattering feet; The fruit-tree shadowed no maiden's book; No greybeard dozed on the garden-seat. Methought I saw, as I gazed within, An idyl of youth with its bliss and pain— The empty house of “what might have been”— The garden of dreams that were dreamed in vain. JANUARY AND JUNE. When snowy eaves are jagged with spar, And every brook to crystal turns, The frost that cracks the water-jar Fills window-panes with flowers and ferns. When flocks upon the hills are lost, And snow-wreaths block the carrier's wain, With silvery flowers and ferns the frost Fills every misted window-pane. When cold has stopped the cricket's tune, And ice-bound clocks forget the hours, The frost, as though it dreamed of June, Fills all the panes with ferns and flowers. When June returns with flowers and ferns It also dreams,—for rocks are mossed With furry rime, and, as it turns, Each willow-leaf seems hoar with frost. But agrimony in the hedge Most wintrily recalls the time When urchins climbed the window-ledge To thaw the flowers and ferns of rime. BY MOONLIGHT. Afoot at midnight. All the way Is warm and sweet with scents of May. The cocks are crowing hours too soon, The dogs are barking far and near, The frogs are croaking round the mere; And in a tree the naked Moon Is crouching down, as though she would Her silvery-bosomed maidenhood Conceal among the leaves, too thin And small to hide her beauty in. Dear Moon, 'tis I, thy friend—who pray Thy company upon my way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">KARMA. In the heart of the white summer mist lay a green little piece of the world; And the tops of the beeches were lost in the mist, and the mist ringed us round; All the low leaves were silvered with dew, and the herbage with dew was impearled; And the turmoil of life was but vaguely divined through the mist as a sound. In the heart of the mist there was warmth—for the soil full of sun was aglow Like a fruit when it colours—and fragrance from flowers and a scent from the soil; And a lamb in the grass, in the flowers, in the dew, nibbled—whiter than snow; And the white summer mist was a fold for us both against sorrow and toil. From the fields in the mist came a bleating, a sound as of longing and need; But the lamb from the grass in its little green heaven never lifted its head; It was innocent, whiter than snow; it was glad in the flowers, took no heed; But the sound from the fields in the mist made me grieve as for one that is dead. And behold! 'twas a dream I had dreamed, and a voice made me wake with a start; Saying: “Hark! once again in the flesh shall ye twain live your life for a span, But since whiteness of snow is as nought in mine eyes without pity of heart, Lo! the lamb shall be born as a wolf, with a wolf's heart, but thou as a man!” COMFORT ON PELION. From white Iolcos by the sunny sea The Thrall went forth at noon—an aged man, Unkempt and wretched, clad in tattered skins, With clouted leggings bound about his knees, And in his palsied hand an oaken staff. Beyond the vineyards and the olive-groves, The flowery slopes and fruitful grassy lawns; Above the shadowy planes, where bright of leaf And red of fruit the ripe pomegranate bursts; Above the chestnuts of the lower glens,— Yea, high above the oaks and windy pines, The snowy top of Pelion in the sun Glittered; but there was ever genial shade Within the hollow ivy-fringèd rock Where dwelt the strong, glad-hearted friend of men, The Centaur. Leaning on his staff, The aged Thrall, pricked on by feverish haste, Climbed upward from the valley; paused to rest, Despite his haste—for haste is scant of breath— On many a root embowered in bosky bloom, On many an ancient boulder; paused to drink By many a brook deep-edged with coloured moss, And fringed with stout green rushes; but in rest Or motion, still he kept his eager eyes Fixed on the glittering peak, and still one thought Shook all his toil-worn limbs with hope and fear— The thought of what immense and awful shape Ruled and had ruled through storied centuries These many-fountained glens and forest-slopes. And as the Thrall fared on, from rock and tree The little birds sang sweetly. On the tree The burnt cicalas chattered; on the rock The lizard basked; and everywhere the soil Laughed out in dimpling depths of grass and flowers Of red, blue, gold; and all the mountain droned With falling waters and with pebbly streams. And now, among the huge red-shafted pines, The last green wall of Chiron's realm, the Thrall Heard suddenly a strain of mighty song, The resonant vibrations of a lyre Divine, colossal—heard an awful voice Which swayed the pine-wood like an April wind, An infinite tender gale of joyous power; And all the pine-wood sang; and all the air Was filled with piny fragrance; and there came A muffled sound of sighing and of song Ascending, as the slopes and leafy glens One after other felt their sleepy boughs Swung in the ever-widening rings of sound. The aged Thrall felt all the aches of toil, Rain, frost—the feebleness and cramps of age— Beguilèd from his limbs. A fiery blood, The primrose sap of youth, through all his veins Ran tingling to the nails, the grizzled scalp; Kindled wild light within the blearèd eyes; Burst into flower—the primrose sap of youth!— Burst into merry blossom in his brain. He stood erect; he flung away his staff, Clapped horny hands, and, dancing to the song, Leaped from concealment of the swaying pines! Magnificent in his immortal age, Th' enormous might of Chiron sang i' the sun. The frost of centuries had blanched his head And hair, which hung in hoary foliage Below his shoulder-blades. A shaggy growth, A frosty herbage, covered back and flank, Each huge and strenuously corded arm, The massy shelving muscles of the chest; While thickly grown on lip and cheek and chin, His beard seemed pendulous mosses white with rime. From the strong withers and the mighty croup Down to the bushy fringes of the hoofs, Age had but dashed with grey the rugged brown— For on the mountain and the mountaineer Alike the wintry white begins atop. Sovereignty, wisdom, joyousness of life Shone in the depths of those immortal eyes, Whose clear blue light, like morning on the hills, Softened to human kindliness a face Rocky, and worn with centuries like a rock, And lit with colour as a rock with flowers, And fixed as rock to endure unflinchingly Pain and the stormy buffets of the world. Abashed at sight of such wild grandeur, dazed, The Thrall, with loosened knees and suppliant hands, Drew near the mighty-throated Singer. He Ceased, and with outspread hand against the strings Silenced the ringing instrument. The Thrall Thus spoke with stammering tongue and frightened eyes: “O Healer and Helper—Chiron!—if indeed Some god unknown thou be not, having here Thine ever-happy seat i' the shining blue On topmost Pelion.” Answering with a laugh, “Well hast thou named my name,” the Centaur said; “Even Chiron, and no whit a god am I. But thou, old father, rise, and tremble not— Unless, indeed, this high pellucid air Strike chilly through thy goatskin; so shalt thou Have pine-knots quickly blazing by the cave To warm thy wintry years withal. But say— For thou art weak and old—from what fair thorpe, In what keen quest, have these thy faltering feet Borne thee so far afield? The aged man Loves less this blue roof than his smoke-browned beams, And mostly haunts the home-fields, whence he hears The distant kine and far-faint neat-herd's pipe.” The Thrall replied: “I speak to gracious ears. A thrall, an aged man and miserable, I seek thy succour. In the peaceful vale, My home, by rich Iolcos and the sea, The common rumour names thee friend of men; Compassionate reputes thee; wise to heal, By virtue of herbs and flowers, all human ills— Wherefore I come to supplicate thine aid.” “Tell me thine ailment, so perchance my skill May give relief.” “Alas! what can there be Of ailments worse than these, and these are mine— Sickness of life with yet desire to live, Old age with memory of the bloom of youth, Thraldom with thirst for freedom,—and dreams, dreams, dreams Of high achievement, dreams no will of mine Avails, or hath availed, or can avail To change to action?” “Not on Pelion grows The herb or flower to heal such ills as these. Life to the oldest is the oldest friend, The one most hard to part with. Nought can cure This ancient malady of growing old! Still age, though evil, is not all unblessed; And thou, old man, whose life has been so long—” “So long!—nay, brief as is the space one takes To stoop and drink in. Lo! a laughing lad, I knelt beside a pool, and as my face Leaned down and touched the image of my face, My bright hair withering fell, my rosy cheeks Grew gaunt and haggard; in my sparkling eyes The light was quenched, and on my palsied limbs My goatskin rotted into rags. I rose And wiped my lips, a frail and aged man. I speak not wildly, for in truth to-day, When I had crossed Anauros' stream, I reached A grove of shadowy planes, and in the midst A solitary rock, and near the rock Clear water checked by pebbles to a pool— A fountain sweet to thirst. I knelt to drink, And as I leaned I knew the shadowy place, The rock, the water. Sixty years ago, A lad, I drank there; sixty years had sped Like lightning, and I knelt there gaunt and old.” “Age, and the disillusionment of age, Are ills past cure or comfort. What remains? A thrall, thou wouldst be free. Why, here is gold Shall buy thee freedom from the frost, the heat, The daily travail. Thou mayst lie i' the sun, And chide the power that hath mismade the world; Or drowse beside the fagots when the wind, An icy mouth, fills all the ways with snow; Nay, mayst thyself have service at thy beck— Brown, blithe-eyed dimpled girls to lay thy board With meat and wine, and spread thy pleasant couch.” The Centaur laughed; but answering with a sigh, The Thrall; “O god-like Chiron, keep thy gold; I seek nor brimming trough nor slothful stall. Freedom were valueless without the boons Of youthful vigour, joy of being, power To act the dreams have made my life a dream— From which I wake with empty palsied hands. Oh, wherefore was I born a rustic child, Mere clod o' the common furrow? O ye paths And emerald shadows of the summer woods, Was there no dryad with a maiden's heart To love my father? Wherefore, O ye streams, That steal through tall green reeds and lonely fields, Did no bright river-god in ambush lie What time my mother, singing as she went, Tripped to you with her pitcher? All unsunned The leprous lichen quickens in the cave; Between the brown earth and the shining blue The golden flower is fondled into life. Even so the embrace of mortal and divine Begets the flower of Heroes. Common men, A squalid growth i' the sunless caves of life, The high gods love not. And of these, indeed, No god hath ever need; but oftentimes The Heroes are th' outstretchèd hands o' the gods When, leaning forth of heaven, they set their strength Towards some great purpose. All my boyish heart Burned for heroic quest, heroic strife, The gladness and the bloody sweat, the death And deathless name of Heroes. In the grass I lay with upward gaze, and pained my heart With vague desire. Th' inexorable heaven Turned over like a monstrous azure wheel, And crushed the worm who dared to vex the gods. I haunted dewy copse and vine-wreathed cave, Lay hid by glassy fountain, watched the creeks Where the blue ocean, changed to emerald sea, Arrives with rippling laugh—arrives—arrives— But never lands, and tires the hope it raised Of some one coming who will never come. And no one came. I heard no satyr laugh; Pan never slept within my vine-wreathed cave; No wood-nymphs, bathing in the slumbrous noon, Pelted and played with silvery flowers of spray! But thirst and hunger, ache of weary limbs, Ague and fever, winter's icy tooth, The dog-star's rage—these came without a prayer! A common clod, with less of joy in life Than any grasshopper upon the clod, I have piped with querulous cries my summer through, Till, shrivelled to a grasshopper with age, I feel the first hoar-frosts of wintry death. I thought of thee abiding on the heights, Immortal through the azure centuries; I knew thee wise, compassionate to men; I said—perchance the Cloud-born, who can clasp A man's hand with a hand the like of man's, May own a heart akin to human hearts, And share my sorrows if he cannot heal.” Immersed in thought the Centaur stood, and smoothed The cloudy tangles of his beard with slow Unconscious stroke. Then turning to the Thrall, “Old father, sit,” he said, “and rest thine age;” Next, bearing from the spar-lit cavern old A platter and a massive golden horn Carved round with golden ivy and ivy-flower, He bade him eat and drink—“And while I speak, Cheer thou thy troubles with the kindly wine, Hearing of Heroes and of common men— For many a Hero as a little child Hath braced his tender sinews in the hug Of these grim arms; and many a silent night, When all the woods were black, and black the plain With sleep, and light gleamed forth from fold nor farm, Alone beneath this snowy peak I've lain, Ringed with the starry hollow of the night, And thought abysmal thoughts of life and time, Of sleeping little men and thronèd gods; And not alone of these, though most of these, But of the many-visaged conscious life In fur and feather, jelly, horn, and stone; And yet of that ubiquitous dumb strain In lichen, tree, and flower towards consciousness; And yet again of that which hath no life— The golden light, the beautiful clear air, The rocky ribs and soft brown flesh o' the earth, The four great winds and laughing babes of breeze; The ice, the frost, and silvery flowers of frost, The rain-drop, feather of snow, and rosy cloud— And one with these, yet so unlike to these, The thunderstorm, the wintry wastes and peaks, Th' innumerable waters of the world; And even yet again—till brain grew faint— Of that mysterious lapse of all that is To that which is not—called of mortals Death. Two and inscrutable, throughout all time, Have been and are Time's riddles—Life and Death. Nothing more strange than Life—but Death; than Death—but Life.” With dreamy eyes the Centaur, as he spoke, Laid hand upon his mighty lyre,—then sang: Grasp my hand! Hold me fast! For I stagger and reel At the tumult and splendour of life rushing past In a whirlwind of fire, dust, vapour, and thunder; For above me and under, Upon this side and that, all the sea and the land, All the skies, and the gods' starry seats in the skies, Spin and spin on the axle of time like a wheel! Through the years, through the æons, With laughter and cries, With clangour of conflict and singing of pæans, The great wheel goes spinning. I see half the round, and I search the dim distance To find the beginning— The point where the vague subtle thought, nonexistence, Is changed to the forms and the colours of being. The great wheel goes spinning, And baffles the brain As it sweeps without pause through the awful, inane, Inscrutable tracts of the vast uncreated, Then bursts into sight Inconceivably freighted With pageants of substance, and colour, and motion. Oh, the wonders of sight and of sound As the great wheel spins dizzily round! Oh, the terror, amazement, delight! Oh, the music and wailing, the laughter and cries! Oh, the numberless faces and eyes Full of beauty or dread! Oh, the shapes that arise And abide but a moment, then vanish and change Into features and forms more unspeakably strange! For, behold! as I gaze, all the substance of life With itself is at strife, And for ever is fleeing, And for ever pursued from disguise to disguise, Still eludes and recoils, still survives and escapes In the masks of divine, inexhaustible shapes— Now a goddess's tear, now a pearl in the ocean, Now a bird, now a worm, now a flower, now a flame— An unknowable essence, incessantly ranging Through dædal surprises, unchangeably changing Yet single and permanent, effluent, Refluent, Ever and never the same! Grasp my hand; hold me fast! For the wheel takes my breath As it whirls its ineffable pageantry past; And I strain in fierce gaze into distance to see The dark goal where existence begins not to be— Where life lapses to death. But the great wheel goes spinning To an end as unknown as the mystic beginning— Goes dizzily spinning, alive and full-freighted To the void Of the cancelled, abolished, destroyed, From the void of the vast uncreated! O my soul, in what region unknown, Far removed beyond thought, did I see The vast shape of a beautiful Woman, who sat all alone With the wheel at her knee! And I saw that the wheel was rotation of time, And the wool of her spinning Was life—but the fleece Was a secret withdrawn beyond winning. Alone in her beauty, she sat there and spun; And she sang a sweet rhyme Out of pleasure—or solace, perchance—for a task never done; But the sound of the wheel in her ears was a low woolly drone That disturbed not her peace; And I cried, but she laboured unconscious, serene; For desire nor appeal can attain to her there, And I never shall know If the task of her wheel be a joy or a woe, And whether she sits as a slave or a queen, In a region that lies beyond worship and prayer! “O life, O death! O mysteries of Fate Which stun the brain and palsy action! Eat, Old father, cheerfully, and thank the gods That hunger saves us from the vast inane!” The Centaur smiled and laid aside his lyre. A little while he stood with dreamy eyes And folded arms; then tossed his cloudy hair Backward and faced the heavens with tranquil front:— “Insatiable, we know not what we would, We would not what we know! The best of life Is action—not the dream of action, thought. Old father, thou art right. A golden time Was that blithe morning of a merry world, When newly felled the pines of Pelion swam Into the radiant East; and glad in strength The flower of Minyan Heroes swept the blue With those stout firs I sent them from the heights. For rowing joyously with laugh and song By flowery isles and green-embowered shores, They saw the eternal snows of Caucasus Flushed with the rose of morning—saw the blue Clear beauty of the glacier ice, the pines Shining with tinted snow; and lo! the while An eagle, black against the glow of dawn Sailed in great circles round the glittering peak, They heard Prometheus groan. But Herakles Smote off those cankering bonds of bronze and ice, And loosed the patient human-hearted god. And when the Heroes landed in the East And won the Fleece, my Jason brought aboard The beautiful dark woman of his love, His bane and after-sorrow. All the sea Danced, garlanded with white and azure flowers, For pleasure of their coming, as they swept, With great oars flashing, homeward; all the sea Lightened and laughed around my swimming trees, And floating upward through the blossomy foam, Smiled sweet wild faces; and the rovers saw On that, but never any other day, The strange white beauty of the ocean-girls Caverned in glassy hollows of the waves. But leaning over Argo's gladdened pines, Peleus, my daughter's child, with throbbing brows Watched the bright girls whose wheels in spinning make The everlasting murmur of the sea; And as he watched, beheld one sweetest face Set in bright hair and crowned with ocean flowers— One sweetest face with dewy lustrous eyes And features rosy with desire of love; And as the clear wave shoaled above her, saw Bosom and limbs more fair than mortal maid's But shaped and coloured like a mortal maid's, And more than any maid's desirable. In after-time when all that golden quest Was ended, and the pines of Argo bleached On Corinth strand, that loveliest of the sea, Grown weary of the unweariable deep, Lay curled in slumber in the Sepian cave. Athwart the violet twilight Hesperus Shone large and golden; full and golden rose The moon above the fleecy folds of sleep; But Peleus, stealing through the myrtle grove, A goddess won that night to be his bride. All Thessaly was one flowered holiday When they were wedded. Toil flung cap in air, Set idle hands akimbo, and moved his feet To sprightly measures of the bridal pipes. Thy glittering house, Pharsalus, was rejoiced To hold so many cities for thy guests,— For Phthia trooped from Tempe to thy feast, Larissa left her far-off shining walls, Rich presents Cranon brought thee in her lap, Yea, Scyros, leaping from her bowery rocks, Came to thee rowing gladly from the sea. I, too, descending from mine ancient cave, Bore sylvan gifts—great garlands full of scent And gracious colour, wrought of all the flowers That grow in warm low fields or make a fire In rocky nooks, or haunting murmurous streams Draw honey from the waters. These I bore, And pleasant boughs from many a goodly tree; And all the palace laughed when they were hung. But one there came to that far-rumoured feast, Unasked, a wrathful guest, and marred the feast; For casting on the board a golden fruit To who was fairest, with a bitter laugh She stalked away: but, flushed with jealous strife, The heavenly queens who graced my grandson's board Contended for the golden husk in vain, And so departed with resentful brows And sullen eyes, and left an empty house, And all that gorgeous bridal closed in gloom!” A sound of voices as the Centaur spoke— Clear youthful voices singing all together— Came floating upward to the snowy peak; And ever as the voices paused, the rocks Sent back the closing cadence of the song. “These by my lads!” said Chiron with a smile, “The beautiful children trusted to my love By kings of many cities. Home they come With quarry from the chase. My merry boys! The mountain loves to hear them!” And the song Came floating through the pinewood to the peak:— “Along the mountain as we go— Halloo—halloo! Our voices echo to and fro— Halloo—halloo! Around us tracts of heather glow And blue lakes slumber far below; Halloo—halloo! Gaily the mountain mocks us so— Halloo, halloo—halloo, halloo! Voices a hundred years ago— Halloo—halloo! Awoke perchance these echoes so; Halloo—halloo! Hearts gladdened at the heather's glow, And bright eyes scanned the lakes below, Halloo—halloo! Gaily they went!—And we shall go. Halloo, halloo—halloo, halloo! Gaily they went: and men will go— Halloo—halloo! A hundred years hence even so— Halloo—halloo! When we are dust, and none can know How glad we were long, long ago! Halloo—halloo! Men are as mist the strong winds blow! Halloo, halloo—halloo, halloo! Men are as mist—they rise and go— Halloo—halloo! The mountain stays for evermoe! Halloo—halloo! They drift where heather and bracken grow— Their voices echo to and fro— Halloo—halloo! Grimly the mountain mocks them so! Halloo, halloo—halloo, halloo!” “Ay, even so, boys! mortals are as mist— They fleet and vanish, but the mountain stays. The mountain does not miss them—has not missed Those fair bright lads who loved his heights so well A hundred years ago. On Corinth strand Was Jason slain in slumber, while he lay In Argo's shadow. From her sides a pine— A cankered pine of Pelion—broke and fell And slew the prince, but Pelion made no moan. And Peleus sits unsceptred on the shore, An ancient body, frail and white with age. Patient he sits beside the Sepian cave, Where in that violet twilight of old time, He won that deathless bride, and first received Her beauteous body with his hands. He waits Her coming from the sea—for she will come With sweet wild faces smiling through the foam, And bright heads crowned with white and azure flowers, To take him to her own immortal home. Patient he sits and childless in his age, For this wild gathering of the ships for Troy Hath plucked the filial staves from old men's hands,— Achilles with the rest. Such bitter fruit Hath been that golden curse the Accursèd cast Upon the marriage table!” Chiron paused; And gazing far beyond the clustered Isles Towards Ida and the fateful Asian plains, He murmured: “It may be some seed of good Shall sprout and blossom from that golden ill— Some germ of concord, amity and peace Spring from that core of discord. From the first One equal blue hath covered all men's heads, But underfoot the restless sons of men, Through ages when no single will was law, Have parcelled out the earth with envious greed, Till now a brook that needs no stepping-stone, A mountain-track, puts men from men apart In tribal isolation. Now at last This grievous Dardan wrong, this common shame, Hath prompted a confederate revenge, And taught the wisdom of united spears. This common shame foreshadows common weal, And time will come when, schooled by violence, Mycenæ, Athens, Phthia, looking up, Shall see o'erhead no little local heaven, But gladly share beneath a wider blue The roof-tree of one nation—one in blood, In language one, and one in deathless fame. That time shall come, though haply long delayed By public folly, private interest, And ere its advent many woes and wars Shall make the life of men a bitter thing, And wheresoever corn in all the land Is sown, women shall mourn the strong men slain— The husbands and the young men beautiful— And blinding tears shall spoil the sickle-strokes Of maidens reaping in the harvest-fields. Such years of trouble will it take to school Cities and kings to wisdom. What complaint Was that of thine, old man—the sad estate Of common men whom no god ever needs? But now I tell thee and do thou give heed, If not the gods, why man needs men's best service. For truly, as I deem, gods, heroes, men Are all one wool upon the flying wheel. Kings are but men and gods but greater kings, In birth unequal, of unequal lot, But all of one same primal seed divine,— For still between the highest and the least The bridal fruits attest the kindred strain. Immortal none, I take it, though their bloom Outlasts man's hoariest longevity; For many a lineage of those deathless gods Hath vanished like a sunset from the heavens, And those now throned above the summer clouds In turn shall pass away. Or if indeed They be undying in some subtle sense The mind conceives of but by glimpse and hint, Their masked divinity shall walk the earth In human flesh and blood. In banished fields Still shall Apollo drive his plough—a slave; And Zeus still chain Prometheus to the peak; And Aphrodite, holding in her hand The golden apple of Eris, shall embroil Predestined cities till the world shall end. But Zeus and all the regnant gods shall pass, And other gods shall thunder from their seats And follow them to darkness, till at last An age will come—oh, there will come an age When perfect manhood shall be man's sole god— A god indeed immortal, joyous, strong,— A god most beautiful and most benign. But man hath utter need of common men To speed the coming of that better time, To speed the building of that godlike state Of world-wide brotherhood, abundant cheer, Peace amaranthine, freedom unrestrained Save by the checks of chastened temperament. That future is far away. These petty states Have hardly yet awakened to the dawn Of nationality. What gleam, one asks, What hope is there of that more radiant dawn When nations, housed beneath a common roof, Shall form one family of equal men? And yet, unless my dreams of man and time Be mere marsh-glimmerings of a muddy brain, That time must come. And all may speed the time— Not Heroes only, but all living flesh, And thou, old father, mayst achieve thy share.” As Chiron spoke, from Æta's distant height Rose smoke, gleamed fire; and, wreathed above the fire Which waxed and brightened momently, the smoke Caught splendour as of gold and blood, and thronged The western heavens with drifts of glowing light. The Centaur watched the blaze with curious eyes, And thought, the witless churl hath fired the woods; But with a bitter laugh the Thrall replied: “That distant time may come; but while the grass Is growing?” Chiron answered with a frown: “Be glad to starve, then! Come what time there may, Thou still must die; and is it no relief To die with such a future in thy gaze And know the children of thy children's children— Some filial echo of thee in some far age— Shall through thy being pluck the perfect flower Of that blest state for which thou couldst but strive?” “I have no children,” said the aged Thrall. “Therein, indeed, old man, I pity thee. The excellence of men is perfected In children better than themselves.” His words Were broken short, for, panting from the woods, Came one with clenchèd hands and dripping chin, A runner spent, who fell at Chiron's feet And gasped:—“He writhes in mortal agonies; The fiery poison chars him to the bone;”— And told in voluble bewildered spech How Dejanira, sick at heart with doubt And vexed with thought of Iole's girlish face, Had sent to Herakles—oh fatal gift!— A wondrous tunic charmed to win his love And woo him homeward to her widowed arms; But steeped in mortal venom fierce as flame, The accursèd vesture charred him to the bone, And searched his blackened flesh with fiery pangs Intolerable. Without or tear or groan Did Herakles endure that deadly love Of Dejanira; but as anguish grew He bade his people bear him in their hands To Zeus his father's ancient mountain-peak, And build on Æta's top a funeral pile Of pines and oaks and lentisks—trees and shrubs Grown on those hallowed heights from age to age— And lay him on the pile and place his club Beneath his head and quickly fire the pile. “But I bethought me, Chiron, of thy skill And fled with frantic feet!” A mighty hand The Centaur stretched towards Æta in reply: “That flame already hath loosened from all pain All that could yield to pain in Herakles.” Even as the sunset heaps the west with fire, But all the east is cold and naked blue Save for a solitary silver cloud, And that lone cloud reflects the gleam and glow— So blazed the pyre on Æta, so the flush Of those heroic brands incarnadined The sorrowing Chiron's silvery head and beard. “Farewell, a long farewell,” the Centaur sighed, “To thee, great-hearted toiler of the world! Farewell, thou strongest, who hast taught mankind That cheerful courage in its resolute hug May crack the ribs of very death. Farewell! It was thy lot—thy mighty heart forbade That it should be thy doom—to labour still For others, and with blithe goodwill obey The bidding of the cowardly and base! And I could weep that never any more Shall these sad eyes behold thy godlike form, These hands in welcome clasp thy conquering hands— Save that my tears would shame a joyous life Of splendid strife and superhuman toil. Farewell, if vanished men may yet fare well— If that prevision of the Happy Isles Be no mere hollow image of desire; If still the good enjoy the blessed sun Through one long summer day, and never more Vex there their lives with strivings of their hands, But ocean breezes blow about the Isles, And flowers of gold blaze, some along the ground, By running water some, and some on trees, And these the happy garland for their heads And fill their hands withal! Thou, too, old man, Fare wisely and well. My kindly lads will lead Thine aged footsteps homeward, lest the beast Which prowls the forest take thee for a prey. Farewell; and when the frail repining years Distress thy painful body, take a thought How mere an atom, insignificant, In all the world art thou; how better men Have found life still more hard; and when thy mind Is querulous with peevish impotence, Take courage somewhat in the thought that thou Hast, like the limpet on the rock, thy use. Lads, guide him down; and, father, bear with thee The cup thou'st drunk from. It may be the gold Will save thee from a master's angry strokes, And change to smiles his dame's resentful frown!” Down through the pine-wood to the fruitful lawns The princes led the Thrall; and as he went The aged man, with brain bewildered, watched The smouldering brands of Herakles, and thought Of Peleus sitting on the lonely shore. The years have gone in thousands since the Thrall Descended from the mountain; but the might Of Pelion still abides; his snow-cap gleams High up against the sun; his shelving sides Are hung with four-and-twenty villages Whose white walls glimmer through the terraced bowers; His vines, his bees, his waters still remain. The brooks of Pelion through the houses laugh In marble channels, and the turbaned Turk, Soothed by the waters in the summer heats, Smokes in grave luxury. Full of pleasant shade And pleasant babblement chestnuts and planes Stand green i' the ancient sun, but woe the while, The forest and the foresters are gone— Save one; for lo! on yon the topmost peak Stands Chiron dreaming still, for wise men say The Centaur was nought other than a cloud, And Herakles in every sunset dies; So, that famed school of Chiron was perchance A splendid image—how in intercourse With cloud and sun and wood and mountain, men Grew virile to enjoy and to endure With temperance and cheerful fortitude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF CHILDHOOD. THE ROBIN. When ice is black upon the pond, And woods and ways are choked with snow, The Robin flutters in! The little maids with wide glad eyes Stand spell-bound lest a breath or sign Should scare him from his crumbs. Oft when the fire is keen with frost, And blinds are drawn and candles lit— O Robin, flutter in!— They sit around the cosy hearth, And hear with wondering love and awe How Robin's breast grew red. Fond little maids! each fancies now That somewhere in the great white snow— O Robin, flutter in!— That somewhere in the tracts of snow, An icy cross forsaken stands, And Christ hangs pale and dead! A childish fancy? Be it so! And let me ever be a child, With Robins fluttering in, Than grow into the man who sees In wintry wastes of unbelief A phantom Christ and Cross!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE STONE FACE. Lo! here the first sun strikes the cold grey peak— Broad August! and in shining wreaths the mist Creeps up from crag to crag against the dawn, While far below, still sleeping in the dusk, Ringed from the great world's trouble and unrest, The little mountain village lies a-row, Fringed with the fragrant selvage of the pines. Descend the glimmering pass, and as you go,— The sun outrunning you with golden feet Till all the red-tiled, white-walled rustic world Laughs out, from grass to gilded weather-cock, With gladsome colour and with breezy life— Look backward to the peak! Look back and pause! For lo! the huge grey crags will all have blent And grown into a countenance of stone: An aged, sweet, majestic face, whose eyes, With wondrous human tenderness, look down Upon the valley and the little lives That come and go in their eternal gaze. In the dim days of old, when snowy beards Belied the childlike hearts that ne'er grew grey, A strange tradition in the valley told How in the golden future should be born, Within the range of those calm kindly eyes, A child, the need and succour of his times, A boy whose face should be in flesh and blood A reflex of that grave, sweet face of stone. The little lives went ever to and fro, Toiled, suffered, loved, enjoyed, and passed away; The generations died—the legend lived! A legend only—a legend often told, Cherished and half believed, for, evermore, The aged and majestic face looked down With wondrous human tenderness and truth. 'Twas Christmas night, two hundred years ago. Deep on the hills the snow lay; deep and white, Lay hushing all the valley, road and roof, Until the clock struck midnight. Then the bells Rang in the holly and the mistletoe; Rang in the merry maskers and the waits; Rang in all gentle thoughts and generous cheer; And lanterns glimmered on the fleecy roads, And sounds of singing moved from house to house. Soft rosy lights filled all the frosty heavens With tremulous floating splendour, and the stars Shone keen and golden through it, and the wind Blew little flakes of cloud like leaves of flowers Across the night; and in the magical Warm flush of colour, every icy peak, And all the long white ridges of the hills, The snowy village roofs, the ghostly pines, Sprang out with startling clearness; and the face— The great stone face, now bearded with the snow, And looking old—so old—with hoary hair— Seemed to lean closer in the rosy light; And that same night a peasant's child was born! The babe throve lustily and grew apace; The years went by, and when the great blue eyes Had learned to trace that visage on the heights, The mother told the legend of old days, The promise of that happy future time. And marvelling, the lad drank in the tale, Mused on it, watched the aged face of stone, And longed for that bright future—longed to see In living flesh and blood that gracious mien, And those dark eyes of majesty. Strange dreams Awakened in his heart, as day by day He raised his ardent eyes up to the peaks— Strange dreams of helpfulness to all the world, Of wisdom and of power to right all wrong, To lift the fallen, soothe the sick at heart, Make life more beautiful and brighten death. He nurtured his keen boyhood on the thoughts Of great dead men, nor overlooked the lore Of that green throbbing world of flower and plant, Bird, reptile, insect, rock, and passing cloud; And all he learnt grew into melody Within his heart. The Vicar marked the lad, Advised him, lent him books, and gave him aid To master those great tongues, now tongues no more— Eye-symbols and a music of the brain— Until at length, when he had quite outgrown His little wondering self and now could look Upon the mighty face of stone and smile To think with what a simple passionate faith He had believed that myth,—the rocky mask Had half-fulfilled the promise of the myth, And stamped some semblance of its tenderness And large sweet power upon the student's mind. Friends were not wanting to the youth, and soon He left his humble cottage in the hills And laboured in the city's learnèd halls, Toiled day and night to win the glorious meed Of being helpful unto all the world, Of being wise with power to right some wrong, To lift the fallen, soothe the sick at heart, Make life more beautiful and brighten death. Nor laboured vainly; for when he returned Once more and saw the face among the peaks— And smiled at childish memories, his friend, The aged Vicar, was content to rest And let the younger man achieve for both. Years sped in glad whole-hearted toil. He served, From early manhood to a reverend age The peaceful peasant people; ministered In helpful sympathetic ways; fulfilled In days of famine, sickness, hopeless need, The golden promise of the legend old; Became, unconsciously and unobserved, All that the village folk had hoped in him Who should resemble that great face of stone. When old age came upon him, oft he stood And gazed with dim fond eyes upon the face Whose gracious semblance of humanity Had thrilled his childish heart and filled his life With noblest duties; often too he told, With frail hand laid upon the little head Of lass or lad, the legend of the face. Like all the little lives that come and go Before the steadfast gaze of those stone eyes, He too departed, full of years and honour. And as he lay dead, cold; his beard like snow Scattered in silvery masses on his breast; And looking old—so old—with hoary hair Loose on the pillow; and his people gazed The last time on those kindly lineaments, They felt a sudden tremor round their hearts, For lo! the face seemed changed—familiar still, But changed in some wise strangely. Then at length One gazed and turning to the window drew The curtains open. Snow was on the hills, And snow hushed all the valley, and rosy lights Filled all the frosty heavens, and the face— The vast stone visage, in the tremulous flush Seemed to lean closer, and the gazers saw His and those great stone features were the same. And this was Christmas night, but all was still! A hundred years ago and folk yet lived Who saw those faces, knew they were the same. But generations die and legends live! The little lives beneath those eyes eterne Toil, suffer, love, enjoy, and pass away; And still the people in the valley tell How in the golden future will be born A child, the need and succour of his times, A boy whose face shall be in flesh and blood A reflex of that grave sweet face of stone! A legend only, never gravely told, Not even half believed in these shrewd days When childhood listens with a grey-beard's heart! SONG. [Making morning-mirth] Making morning-mirth Larks were singing loud Over flowery earth, Under shining cloud; Golden-haired and gay Started on his way The laughing lad; Time lay bright before, And a branch he bore With blossoms clad. O'er the wintry wold Fell the twilight snow; Homeward, hoarse and cold, Flapped the famished crow. Haggard, frail, forlorn, On his rugged thorn The grey-beard bent; Night before him lay; No star gleamed; the way No further went. MENA THE LIBYAN. “The boy so long delighteth in his play; The youth so long pursues his maid; so long The old man broods upon uneasiness, That none can find the time—not even one— In all the regions of the level world To meditate upon the very God!” And Mena, rising, fled the babbling streets; And climbing through the shadow of the woods, Gained one great ledge which shelved above the mass Of billowy foliage, and beheld beneath The Libyan city on this hand, and on that The plain of western waters. From below No murmur save the woodland's reached his ear: And resting on the rocky ledge, he crossed His arms upon his bosom and withdrew His spirit from all things living, fixed it fast Upon the Life, and grew entranced in God. And God upheld him, and he leaned on God And knew no fleshly need, no touch of time. In the long summers—for the varying year, Even as the sylvan waters of a brook Divide against a boulder in the brook, And now the sunny current carries down Blue gleams of sky and leaves and flowers, and now Grey shadows, but through all the changeful day The boulder feels no change, even so the year Brought lapse of seasons, even so the man Of seasons and of years was unaware— In the long summers moss and tendrils grew About his limbs; the spider wove her web Around his head. In wintry moons the trees Were shattered by the tempest in the woods; But Mena heard not. Neither felt he rain Nor hoar-frost blanching tangled hair and beard Within his beard the small birds built in spring And, later, trills and chirps and gladdened wings Made happy music to the early sun Upon his bosom; but he heard no sound. And Mena waxed—like all things mortal—old, A haggard frame! But still despite the years His spirit drooped nor withered—wrapt in God! The woodlands fell and rotted in their place; The Libyan city crumbled, thundered down Like snow in April, drifted wide in dust Along the four great winds which purge the world; And lo! the waters of the western sea Drew ever further westward, sank and shrank, And left but sand and salt and thirst and fire, Mirage and dumb tremendous solitude. And Mena, with a hopeless sigh, awoke: “O Thou unknowable and holy God, How shall I hope to know Thee as Thou art? Long hours I seek Thee, till my weary soul Sinks back to rest her weakness on the earth. O God, will ever thought be more than babe Which stretches to the moon its simple hands?— The Lord be my protector, what is this?” He rubbed his eyes and gazed, amazed, and shook With awe and speechless wonder; for behold! The desert flared before him, and he stood Near trunks of forest changed to stumps of stone, And saw the solitude of salt and sand Where no man in the living world had trod. And Mena, while he gazed, became aware Of hoariest age and utter nakedness. He turned his face against the rock and wept. Then lo! upon the east the desert changed, As in a dream, to fields and homely trees And glittering waters; and the weeping man Beheld them and his heart was lifted up; And hastening on with feeble steps, he strove To reach that blessed isle of living land. He travelled all that day through sand and salt, Through valleys where in long-forgotten time Water had rolled the boulder, worn the cliff, But now from eye to eye 'twas stone and stone; Then fell, outworn, and slumbered where he fell, But rose ere dawn and journeyed, wild with hope, Saying: “Those waters and delightsome trees Were surely a gracious vision sent of God To lead me onward.” Then at length he marked Where limestone in a dark sierra jagged The scarlet of the morning. Here he climbed And saw beyond the ridge—oh, joy of joys! The broad Nile flowing through a fruitful land, And sphinx and temple and pyramid and palm, Green fields, and men and women. And he lay And wept for gladness. After he had reached That marvellous city of a later race, He rested many days—a shadow of man— And watched with awe the new old life, the same Old joys and sorrows of the ancient world; And while he watched, the ancient thought recurred In language no man spoke, and “Ah!” he sighed, “The boy so long delighteth in his play; The youth so long pursues his maid; so long The old man broods upon uneasiness, That none can find the time—not even one— To meditate upon the very God!” And even as he thought, another thought Broke slowly on him, like a tardy dawn Which colours weed and stone and common earth, And makes the homeliest seem divine and strange: “Perchance—it may be, though it seems so strange,— Perchance the truest and the holiest life Is his who acts in God, not his who stands Enmarbled in a many-centuried dream Of who but God knows what he thinks is God!” And Mena sighed but spoke not, only mused— “I am but a babe delighted with Thy light, That hath stretched out to Thee its simple hands— A babe, O God, that now must die a babe And trust for growth in Thine eternal years!” 'Twas in these later days the man was named By those who knew him “Mena,” for that he Through all that wind of change and whirl of waste Had stood the one man constant in the world. CHRISTMAS EVE. The midnight Mass. 'Twas a snowy night; But the great Cathedral was warm and bright— Ablaze with flame and colour, and filled With a mist of incense, and music that thrilled The motley audience drawn together, Despite late hours and the wild white weather— Partly from sentiment, partly from piety, Partly in quest of a pleasing variety— To view the strange spectacular ritual (For which, O Catholics, Protestants twit you ill, For why should one rank under worship of images This beautiful scene handed down from the dim ages?) Near the rails of the chancel the crib was seen, Roofed and clustered with winter-green; On a truss of straw from the manger smiled The golden-nimbused celestial Child; While over the crib gleamed the star which of old Led the Kings with their myrrh and frankincense and gold. The service was odd, but of singular interest; The strains of Mozart lulled all feelings of sin to rest; The lights, fragrance, garlands of ivy and holly tree Moved the senses to worship—(Can that be idolatry?)— And all had been touched to a certain extent With a cosy religious sentiment, When the organ stopped and the singing ceased, And the people sat down; and a grey-haired priest Mounted the pulpit in alb and stole, To save, if it might be, some sectary's soul. At the side of the altar in pride of place Sat my Lord Archbishop enthroned; and his Grace Smiled out of gladness of heart as he viewed The half-heretic curious multitude Waiting, like furrows in spring, to receive The seed of the faith that Christmas Eve. In beautiful language the preacher spoke Of the Syrian hills and the shepherd folk Who heard the Angels and saw the light As they watched their flocks in that ancient night. And then he marked how the Lord had come To a world that knew Him not, men who were dumb; But to-night, oh! it was not the Angels alone Who sang; oh, not only to these was He known; But the whole world rejoiced in the joy of His birth! From the East to the West round the peopled earth As the midnight travelled it carried along The joy of that birth, the thanksgiving of song. As the preacher proceeded a strange thing occurred. My Lord Archbishop first fancied he heard The wind rising without; then a tramping of feet; Then a hoarse vague clamour of crowds in the street; Then wailing and sobbing and agonised screams. Then his Grace grew aware—as a man when he dreams— That the walls of the church were absorbed by the night, And the snow-flakes were falling. Then, lo! a strange light Like a cloud hid the altar; and in it there stood Christ crowned with His thorns—pale—and ghastly with blood From the wounds of His scourging. Behind the bright cloud, Dimly seen, swayed a moaning, tumultuous crowd Round a shadowy cross, which they struggled to bear. Christ spoke: “What availeth your praise or your prayer? What profits to hallow the day of my birth, Yet ignore that I still am among you on earth? Of Christ ye but dream. I am here; but ye know The mere legend of Christ—not the Christ in His woe, In His Church, in His flesh.” From behind the bright cloud Rose the sorrowful moan of the shadowy crowd. “And these, too, are Christ! Yet who is it sees How he scourges and pierces and slays me in these? Behold them and know them!” Then out of the night Came the crowd, and were seen in the cloud's mystic light. They swept by in thousands. The sound of their woe Filled the midnight with terror! Whatever men know Of the ills of the world, it was there in some form, Flitting out of the splendour and into the storm. All tribes and all nations, each colour of skin, All aspects of sorrow and suffering and sin, All the poor of all cities, all shapes of disease, Passed sobbing and writhing. And Christ was of these— These were Christ in His flesh! And my Lord, as they passed, Perceived that on all, from the first to the last, Lay a cross like a shadow. Then lo!—in a wink All was changed. His Grace yawned. “Have been dozing, I think!” ANNO DOMINI XXXVII. Grey dawn upon the mountain. Grey and cold, O'er shivering pines and dripping boulders rolled The great mist upward to the unseen peak. The wind blew chill. The scant light, grey and bleak, Showed haggard outlines. In the stony waste Knelt by a torrent one who seemed in haste To cleanse his hands of some deep ghastly stain. He washed and moaned. Again and yet again He raised them to the bleak grey light, and scanned Their horror with wild eyes; then gathered sand And bent and washed with frenzy. Upward drew The spectral mist. Far out, the day was blue Above the tumbled forest slopes: but here, Above the man, the icy atmosphere Was filled with mist and shadow of mist. No tree Throve on these heights. No grass grew. One could see But vast bald domes, and grim escarpments strewn With block and shingle—stone, and stone, and stone, All streaming with the vapours of the peak. The man beside the torrent with a shriek Arose: “The waters mock at my despair; Their jeering voices call me everywhere; They madden me! The clouds upon the height Drain all the depths of Heaven day and night, And day and night I wash, but never more Will these red hands—” He wrung them with the roar Of some wild beast that cannot break its cage. Far down upon the boundless foliage O' the valleys burst the sun. A brilliant green Laughed out from rocky slope and deep ravine. The low hills glittered. Silvery waters ran Through clearings in the wilderness. The man Beneath his cloud as from a cavern gazed And shuddered with the cold. The morning blazed— A vast blithe fire which drew his steps below! Blue flanks and shining summits capped with snow Rose where the distant Alps walled in the wide, Glad scene. The man went down the mountain-side. He reached the pines; then stopped. What sudden fear Caused him to crouch and tremble? Hand to ear, He listened, breathless! Rising from afar, A strange wild sound, flung back from crag and scar, Came floating through the hills—and sank and died. The man glared fiercely down the gorge and cried: “Tiberius sends his bloodhounds forth at last!” He turned to flee, but paused. Then slowly passed The look of terror from his hunted eyes. “An end of all things comes for him who dies,” He murmured, rising. “Earth can compass not More hideous exile than this savage spot. What worse can Cæsar do than take away My life? What then! Who slays me will but slay Hunger and thirst and weariness and cold; And I shall sleep—and never more behold Those awful eyes—that thorn-crowned head which fills The nights with terror!” Echoing through the hills Once more the trumpets blew a long wild strain. The man plunged downward through the woods to gain The winding levels of the rugged pass. With sunlight flashed from spear-head and cuirass, Through the green glen the Roman soldiers strode. Red-plumed beyond the spears their tribune rode. The man stood forth and with uplifted hand Cried: “Halt!—It is your prisoner bids you stand; The fugitive Tiberius seeks is here; Bring forth your chains!” The Roman chief rode near And eyed the man. The man stood gaunt and grim; Half clad in wolf-skin; naked, breast and limb; Through tangled hair his eyeballs blazed like flame. “What man are you?” the tribune asked—“Your name?” He answered: “Once I ruled Judea. Men Bowed low and named me Pontius Pilate then.” Wondering the soldiers gazed. The tribune said: “You strangely err. Tiberius is dead. We seek you not.” The legionaries marched on With iron tramp. Long after they had gone The man still stared. At set of sun that day Unhappy Pilate cast his life away. THE END.</field>
