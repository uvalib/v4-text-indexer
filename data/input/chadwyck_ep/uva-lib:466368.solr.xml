      <field name="fulltext">To sit alone And think for comfort how, that very night, Affianced lovers, leaning face to face, With sweet half listenings for each other's breath, Are reading haply from a page of ours, To pause with a thrill (as if their cheeks had touched) When such a stanza, level to their mood, Seems floating their own thought outââSo I feel For theeâand I for thee.â Elizabeth Barrett Browning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I DAWN. âStanding with reluctant feet, Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet!â Longfellow. [The poetry that lies within the soul] The poetry that lies within the soul Cannot be written, nay, the greatest poet Is he who keeps the treasure in himself. Once given birth to, this enchanting music Is often play'd by tuneless instruments; This lovely flow'r, whose colours beam'd so fair In the dim forests of the inmost soul, Fades often when it meets the eye of day. These living pictures glowing in the heart, Strange, sweet, and variable,âin an hour Thousands created, often, when described Lose more than half their beauty. For these thoughts Are thoughts, and thoughts alone,âthe pow'r of speech Destroys them, as a ray of mid-day sun Melts Winter's handiwork on frozen panes. This sweet entanglement of daylight dreams, Like creepers, with their growing tendrils twined Round the heart's core, cannot be disengaged Uninjured or unmixed, for where is he Who shaking down the clusters of the vine Knows each and ev'ry grape, or can discern One from another? Thus with poet's dreams! This unsung poetry, when written down And shackled in the narrow bonds of verse, Is made so poor, so weak beneath the load Of such unnatural clothing, and the weight Of high-flown words, that it becomes ere long No poetry at all. So bear with this! MOONLIGHT. High midst the stars the moon is risen, Amongst the fleeting clouds that chase Each other o'er the vault of heaven Into those mighty realms of space, Which far beyond all human sight Expand in floods of golden light. Beneath, the trees repeat some hist'ry Replete with awe, for each one's head Sways o'er its shade, a space of myst'ry Upon the glade where it is spread; This is the fairest, softest hour, When all Unseen, Unknown, hath pow'r. The Queen of Night her face beholdeth In yon clear stream, that quivers gay, Shaking the image fair it holdeth As tho' to carry it away Upon its wave. Ah! foolish stream! Thou art enchanted by the beam! This heart would fain to shake from off it A light as bright that weighs it down, The light of eyes that seem to scoff it, A proud cold brow, that seems to frown. Yet, as without the moon yon stream, So is it dark without their beam! I try, like yonder restive river, To cast the fair remembrance hence, But like it, I must hold for ever That cruel light, at sad expense Of happiness and peace, until The spell is broken by his will! THREE NAMES. Upon an oak tree's rugged bark There is a faintly 'graven mark, Carved by this hand, when it was young. It is a name, and on this tongue The sounding of that name was evermore In those sweet days of yore! Upon a tombstone on the green Some letters, deeply traced, are seen; 'Tis the name of the one who lies asleep Beneath that little grassy heap, Where flowers bloom above the head Of the dear remember'd dead, Whose short terrestrial race is run, And these two names belong to one. But there is yet another place, Where, in deeper letters far, I trace That self-same name. The hardy oak May fall beneath the woodman's stroke, And its bark, which bears that name so fair, May be borne away, I know not where, The name engraved upon the stone With moss is almost overgrown, And those who knew it not before Could scarcely guess what name it bore; But neither Time, nor tide, nor place Can by their influence efface From this sad heart that cherish'd name Written upon the oak, the same That is engraved upon the stone, And these three names belonged to one, To one who once was true and kindâ These names an angel left behind! SONG. [It was a Dream, and it is dreamt] It was a Dream, and it is dreamt; 'Tis gone,â'tis past,â'tis fled. But, oh! its Spirit is with me still, Though all besides is dead! And it haunts me yet, by the light of day, Beneath the sun's glad beam, And it haunts me in the midnight hour, This Spirit of my Dream! Oh! would that I could dream again A dream as fair and bright! Then would I sleep my life away And turn my day to night! Oh! it was like the falling star That flashes through the sky, Or like the echo from afar Of some sweet melody. But now that star has fall'n to earth, I hear no more that strain, Though the echo of its sweetness For ever will remain! TIME. âTime is!â âTime was!â âTime is past!â (Spoken by the Brazen Head made by Friar Bacon.) Time is a great Destroyerâall have told, Or else may tell (such is the fate of all!) Of hearts that 'neath his touch have waxen cold, Of blossoms that his winds have made to fall! Time is a great Physicianâhe can heal The wounds that others strive to bind in vain; He can remove the poison'd barb of steel, And only leave the memory of pain! Time is no Flattererâhis dusky wings Cannot be stay'd with riches or with might; Nay, over those to whom he brings good things He seems to wing most rapidly his flight. Time is a Necromancerâhe can change What once we lov'd,âthe place, the heart, the face, Into a thing at once so sadly strange That memory no semblance there can trace! Time is a Sextonâand he daily delves A thousand graves in which the Past is laid, Until at length his votaries themselves Forget the griefs which made them seek his aid! Time is a Conquerorâand his magic wand Can crush the gate which CÃ¦sar smote in vain; Behold around the traces of his hand, A mighty city crumbling on the plain! Time is Immortalâhe will ever fly As he has flown thro' centuries of light: Waste not his hours,âfor, reader, you and I Have but a moment to observe his flight! LINES. [I saw so bright, so fair a thing] I saw so bright, so fair a thing, Of red, of blue, of green, A feather from an angel's wing I deemed it must have been. I seized it, with impatient grasp, All eager for my prize, When, lo! it was a poisonous asp With red malicious eyes! The wound inflicted by its sting I bear unto this day; I trust so fair, so foul a thing May never come your way! A LOCK OF HAIR. How small a thing is this! and yet how great, How puissant with its tearful memories! 'Tis a remembrance of that Sleeping One, And echoes back the music of a voice Which has these many years been hush'd to us! We said that she should ever live to us: We laid her in her grave, and silently Each mourner made a vow that years might pass, That friends might die, and new ones fill their place, Yet she should dwell with us; of ev'ry heart That lov'd her when in life, she should, in death, Become the silent occupant, and this, Looking into her grave, we each one swore! So time pass'd on, and with each year the wound (At first seemingly so incurable, And bleeding fresh with ev'ry fresh allusion To the sad past), heal'd slowly, unawares. The place was changed, old memories crept out, Then fairer, newer ones, all furtively Slunk in their place. With friends it was the same; Their fresh and many faces half confus'd us. That sweet pale face grew paler and more pale As years pass'd on, dimmer and yet more dim; We thought of her, 'tis true, but not as we Had thought of her before. She seem'd a form Like to an angel, beautiful and fair, But indistinct. She was a shadowy thing, Full of angelic beauty! but her face (That dear, dear face we kiss'd in days of yore), Which one amongst us now remembers it? I cannot speak for others, but by me, Oh! Absent One! thou art remember'd! Thy silent voice, in shadowy dreams, Has held communion with my spirit! Upon my lips thy dear unutter'd name Has often linger'd. I have often Thought o'er its music, and ten thousand times Spelt o'er its sweetness silently; but when I find thy shadow growing dim again (Lest it should fade from out my memory, Leaving no faintest trace behind, whereby To know thee, if again in higher realms We chance should meet), I gaze from time to time Upon this lock of thy dear dark brown hair As I am gazing now, and then, oh! C? I see thee once again; I know thee then; I hear thy voice once more, it teaches me What is the worth of Life. I see the world In all its smallness. Then I long, dear C? For that uncertain time, when with my burden I may rest by thy side, and be, like thee, Only remember'd by the few who lov'd me! HOPE. Faint Star of Hope! Far on the dark horizon Of my sad life, thy rays fall tremblingly Upon my heart; a moment there they linger, Then lend to others their sweet brilliancy, Leaving my soul in darkness worse than dying! Oh, fickle Light! when wilt thou cease to glimmer Around this broken altar? Long in darkness It hath been shrouded, and thy rays forsake it 'Ere its dark crevices are lighten'd by them. Oh, cruel Light! Here shed thy beams for ever, Or leave me quite! I could not be so hopeless As when I see the shade of what I hope for Too faint to grasp! . . . . . . . . SONG. [There is a lustre in thine eye] There is a lustre in thine eye Which only sheds its beams for me, There is a language in thy smile Which others may not see! There is a music in thy voice Which only echoes in my ear, There is a sadness in thy laugh Which others do not hear! Thou hast a beauty of thine own Which others do not care to seeâ There is a secret in thy heart, 'Tis only told to me! REMEMBERED VOICES. When the sun's last rays have vanished From the distant hill, In the silence of the twilight I can hear them still,â Dear and unforgotten Voices! I can hear you still! As I gaze upon the shadows Length'ning on the plain, Eyes that now are closed for ever Beam on me again,â Well remember'd eyes! long slumb'ring! Wake to me again! Happy hour! yet mix'd with sadness, Ere the candles beam, Let me pause, as on the threshold Of some pleasant dream,â Ere the light dispels the darkness Let me dream my dream! If before thee I should travel To the unknown shore, Thus it is that I would linger Near to thee once more,â I would linger in the gloaming Near to thee once more! What is Absence, then, or dying? What, to meet or part, If our memory lives for ever In some faithful heart?â I would die, if I might linger Only in one heart! IN THE WOOD. I wander'd in the wood alone, The ev'ning mist fell soft and grey, And stars were peeping one by one To say that day was dead and gone, Alas! for ever and for aye! Oh! little Star! I know so well The gentle falling of thy rays! Upon thy light I love to dwell,â Thy sad, soft light, which seems to tell A history of other days! How many hearts, how many eyes Are lifting now themselves afar, How many mystic thoughts arise, How many buried memories Out of the image of that star! Upon my cheek I do not feel The breath of Autumn's chilly wind, For Summer zephyrs seem to steal Upon my senses, and the Real Is fading fast from out my mind. I mind me when these trees were clad With leaves that round me now are blown, I mind me when my heart was glad, When I was never pale and sad, And did not wander thus alone. Oh! when the Spring again appears, When flow'rs are bright and thrushes sing, Then will these eyes have dried their tears, And will the Spring of after years Be like in aught that bygone Spring? Oh! will the flow'rs seem half as sweet, And will the sunshine look as bright, And will the moments fly as fleet, And will this heart begin to beat As once before, when it was light? Was it for this that Earth was fair? Was it for this that Love was given? That we should look on empty air And think on that which once was there, Yet never, never grasp our heaven? Can Joy survive each thought of Spring? Does Night set in e'er close of Day? Does Pleasure end in sorrowing? And Love, in such a wither'd thing As yon sere leaf that strews my way? Alas! I would that I could say! I would that Spring could ever last, That Hope would never fade away, That Life could be one long To-day, So we should never know a Past! TO ? [Like me a little, since thou wilt not love me] Like me a little, since thou wilt not love me, Let me be something to thee in thy life, Something to 'mind thee of thy youth and beauty, When both have left thee, in those after years Which thou mayst live to see as well as others; Then think of me, as one who stood apart And worshipp'd thee in silence and in sorrow,â Then think of me, and give me of thy heart (Whether I am alive or dead, what matters?) A larger share than thou canst spare me now! A DREAM. Last night, like a ray of light, In a dream she lingered by meâ Loved, but not lost to me quite, Since, in the dim stilly night Sometimes so lovingly nigh me, That the soft flow of her hair (Dusky, all save here and there Where the gold shadow just lights it), Has hover'd my couch above, Like the tame flight of a dove Ere merciless hawk affrights it! C?! the touch of thy hand Last night, in the unnamed land Somewhere 'twixt waking and sleeping, Silenced the voice of my sighs, And swept from my sorrowful eyes All the sad tears I was weeping, Close to my heart sad and lone, Wearied with sorrows unknown, As thy dear gentle hand lingers, Sorrow, and Sin, and unrest Seem not to survive in my breast The touch of thy soothing fingers! Oh! never forgotten dream! Like a bright heavenly beam, Come and revisit me often! C?! the cares which each day Crowd round my darkening way, Nightly thy presence shall soften! Dearest! what dangers can harm When thy dear guardian arm Clasping securely around me, Shuts from my soul, like a veil, All that could tempt and assail And ever seek to confound me? Thus, thus, for a little while, With thy soft reproving smile, C?! continue to guide me, Till, with my hand in thine own, I, to the country unknown Some day may journey beside thee! [He is gone! He is gone! and as a page unwritten] He is gone! He is gone! and as a page unwritten, Or only traced with what is good and brave, So his young life, which all too early smitten, Sends home his soul unto the God who gave. As some bright bird, sent from a heav'nly palace To linger for a while in this sad world, Or as some water-flower, whose spotless chalice Has only to the zephyr been unfurl'd. So was his soul! That bird has flown for ever Back to those golden realms, more fair than these; That sweet white flow'r has floated down the river, Leaving to us its fragrance on the breeze. Oh! if in Heav'n there is some highest Heaven, Some place where happiness is doubly known, Surely a dwelling-place will there be given To the pure soul so early heav'n-ward flown! And if the ones who now are sadly gazing, On all that makes his absence seem more drear, Could, to that distant land their eyes upraising, Pierce through the veil which hides him from them here; There, with the Angels, who like him have striven, For those rich blessings, still by us unguess'd, They would behold, in God's eternal Heaven, Him who on earth had been beloved the best âDO NOT FORGET ME!â Do not forget me! when the day is ending, And dark'ning shadows gather o'er the sea; Sometimes alone, and near this casement bending, Pause in the twilight and remember me! Think on the brightness of the summer weather, Years, years ago, one well-remember'd day, When to the woods we wander'd forth together, Amongst the primroses and blue bells gay. Time changes all! those blossoms now are faded, Or, if they bloom, they do not seem as fair As once before, when, by the beech-trees shaded, You twined them tenderly amongst my hair. I dash away the tear, that all unbidden Arises, when I think that this is past, And muse on all my anxious heart has hidden Since the sad ev'ning when I saw you last! Earth has enough of heav'n to gild its sorrow And turn the current of its griefs away, Could we but learn to dread no dark To-morrow, And live for ever in one glad To-day! Whilst I have mused in solitude and sadness On all the changes fleeting time can bring, Others have hallow'd to you, with their gladness, The happy hours of many another Spring. All this I know, yet when the shadows darken, And when none other better loved is by To mark your silent mood, perchance, or hearken To the soft echo of a half-heaved sigh; Then lend to me that hour of soft emotion, And link'd in spirit let us leave the shore, And floating o'er the dark mysterious ocean, Be unto one another as before! Do not forget me! when the day is ending, And dark'ning shadows linger o'er the sea, Sometimes alone, and near this casement bending, Pause in the twilight and remember me! âSHE CANNOT LOVE HIM AS WELL AS I.â She cannot love him as well as I, There are so many who throng her round, And she forgetteth, when they are by, The very colour of his eye, And of his voice the sound! She hath loved others so well, so long, This can be only a passing whim, The faint last echoing of a song Ling'ring awhile behind the throng, Which was not sung for him! Ah! she might have loved him once, and well, But her own heart says it is now too late, And that with the bitterness which Life Hath planted in her like a knife,â 'Twere easier to hate! Yet how he loves still to linger nigh, And to tread that too well trodden shore, To drink of the fount which half is dry, And read that fable in her eye So often read before! And thus it hath been since man was born, And 'tis thus the web of life is wove, Ah! and even I, the while I mourn, Know not the heart of him I scorn, Or e'en of him I love! THE LAST OF HEAVEN. I have heard of the last of Earth, Of the last faint sigh that is given By the weary soul, ere it takes its flight To those unknown realms of endless light For which it has hoped and striven,â But now, oh! I feel in the dim sad light Of the day that is fading fast into night, I have tasted my last of Heaven! âFAREWELL!â And now farewell! I fain would shake The links that bind my heart to thee; Those useless fetters I would break And let the 'prison'd one go free! When thou art absent from my sight, And other eyes around me shine, I try to think those eyes as bright, As full of life and love as thine. What care I for another's loveâ Another's kisses on my cheek? Another's lips repeating words I fear that thine will never speak? I know not why my spirit sighs, For other hearts are seeking mine; And I can read in other eyes The tenderness I miss in thine. Yet 'tis in vain! Thy friendship coldâ The calm esteem I have from thee, Is dearer, oh! ten-thousand fold, Than Love, which others give to me! LINES. [They tell me I am much too young] They tell me I am much too young To muse upon the Pastâ That I am but a child, they say I should be living for To-day, Whilst youth's short pleasures last. They tell me they have had their Past, Their happy Yesterday; They say if now my life be sad, What will it be when I have had Real sorrows, such as they? Alas! I know I may become E'en sadder at the last, But now I sigh, as well as they; For young and fair, and old and grey, We all have had a Past! TO ? [I leave thee now, if I could ever love thee] I leave thee now, if I could ever love thee, Fate hath prevented such a consummation, And nipped the bud ere yet it was a blossom! I leave thee! and with thee, may be, I lose My hold on Happiness, on Life, on Love; I leave thee, and in flying thee, may be I fly a snare, an error, or a heart Broken unwittingly by fickleness! Thou art so often present in my thoughts, Yet in thyself but yet so dimly known, 'Tis well I cannot read within thy heart, Perhaps its bitter mock'ry of my own! Oh! Heart unknown! If thou hast ever mused, As I have done, upon a half-closed book, Hoping its pages fraught with sympathies, Or learnt the eager language of a lookâ Then thou hast known me better than I deemed; The speaking language of our meeting eyes Has made us friends already, and our hearts Linked with unuttered mystic sympathies! Adieu, then, Friend! I leave thee, once again To thy blue eyes I look my last farewell! I leave with thee, perchance, my Hope, my Life, Perchance my curse, my death, for who can tell? THREE WISHES. 1 I only ask'd to love thee, 'twas a boon I deem'd the haughtiest would scarcely spurn; I only ask'd to give thee all my heart, And pray'd for nothing in return! 2 I loved thee then, and with no common love, But with that love another wish there grew, And fervently I pray'd both day and night That thou might'st some day love me too! 3 That time is past; but in these many days Since the bright summer-time when last we met, Another wish, another pray'r I raiseâ That wish, that pray'r isâto forget! âHE IS NOT HERE!â The voice of Spring is whisp'ring through the land, âRejoice, sad one! who through the long dim days' Of dismal Winter's reign, wert wont to stand And sigh in darkness for the sun's bright raysâ Rejoice! for Nature will not hear thee sighâ This is no time for musings lone and drearââ Yet sighing only can my heart reply âIn vain, I cannot smile,âhe is not here!â âARE WE REMEMBERED?â Often, when hearts are beating high, When pleasure beams from ev'ry eye; When sounds of music rise and fall, And laughter rings through festive hall; Unseen ones mingle with the crowd, And voices murmur, half aloud, âAre we remember'd?â Ah! gentle eyes! in many a dream Since last you closed, I've seen you beam! Dear voices! I can hear you now Murm'ring in accents soft and low, âWe are remember'd!â A year agoâa month, may beâ And they were smiling here, as we; A year from now, and we, as they, To other beating hearts may say, âAre we remember'd?â Then may the answer be the same, From faithful lips, whereon our name Lingers unutter'd! Blest are they Who in a world of change can say, âWe do remember!â II. NOON. âMan's love is of man's life a thing apart, 'Tis woman's whole existence . . . .â Byron. TO ? [I take my pen, and almost weep to find] I take my pen, and almost weep to find That I can only write of what I knowâ Athwart the shrunken mirror of my mind No varied forms pass glitt'ring to and fro. No clanking forms of gallant knights and squires Whose glories once my childish voice would praise, No feudal castles, from whose turret spires The captive maid her ev'ning song would raise. (That song the earl might hear, who rode hard by In bright array, and echoing through the dell Her voice might reach his heart, and he might try To win her love who sang to him so well, But ah! she loved his page! . .) Thus did the charms Of mediÃ¦val fancy ebb and flow; My soul seem'd all astir with men at arms, My eager heart dream'd only of the foe! Palfrey and falconâhelm and nodding plume, The sheen of armour and the gleam of spears, Made of my brain a kind of lumber-room Stored with these relics of the bygone years. But now how changed! To me one knight alone Seems to deserve the honour of his spurs; And the one heart my heroine deems her own Seems to beat all as loyally as hers! I am my own unworthy heroine now, And you the noble knight with gallant crest; Your colours blush triumphant on my brow, Your waving pennon flutters o'er my breast! And so I write of Loveâmy waking dream, And so I write of you, and only you, And all monotonous my songs must seem To those who cannot love you as I do. Yet, as the limpid waters of a stream Are still the same, though view'd from either shore, So on the changeless river of my dream Flows to the same soft music evermore. Its source is in the heart that beats for you; And onward to the flood-gates of the tomb Its waters glisten with the self-same hue, Save where or shine or shade lends light or gloom. Take then the flow'rs it bears upon its wave; And should your wand'ring fancy find them fair, Think that your breath alone their fragrance gave, Nor scorn to gather what you planted there. Take all the gold that mingles with its sand; Since, like the Hebrew Prophet long ago, Yours was the wond'rous touch, the magic wand, That smote the rock and bade the waters flow! ANOTHER THOUGHT. Oh! cling to me still! Do not move! Yet awhile press thy heart to my heart, And kiss into the Life of my Love Darling! its Soul, which thou art! Warm with the warmth of thy breath, And light with the light of thine eyes, The life I would raise from the death We have died to the World and its ties! Oh! lend it the sound of thy voice, Oh! lend it the charms of thy face, And dress the dear hope of my choice In thy garments of beauty and grace. So that, e'en should'st thou, Darling, depart, Should I nestle no more in thy breast, I may still to the heart of my heart Press the flow'r of the love thou hast blest? Ah! then I could wander alone, Whilst bearing that burden of bliss, My Darling's yet doubly my own, Sweet echo of moments like this! IDOLATRY. God, who alone knows whence we came, Made us half fire, and half of clay, Fire, which consumes the earth away, And earth, extinguishing the flame. Sometimes a flame, sometimes a clod, Earth-bound, or looking to the skies, So is my soul, but either wise, On earth, I look to you as God! Above me, on His golden throne I seem to see, 'twixt darkness riven, The God of All, in highest Heaven, A Being terribleâunknownâ Holding the puppets, Life and Death, At times allowing them their will, Or bidding them, at times, be still, And chiding them, with awful breath! To countless worlds and kingdoms more Hurling, from His high hunting-grounds Blessings and curses, as to hounds Are flung the scraps they scramble forâ Dealing new forms of Life and Death, Or unnamed gifts, unlike our own, New kinds of happiness, and woes unknown, Unguess'd by us, who crawl beneath! Giving His will of snow and hail To unknown continents, which lie (Shaming our poor geography), Out of our ken,âbeyond our paleâ Or lending summer-tide and light Or what to us seems bright and warm, To countless myriads, who swarm Beyond what we have called our sight. Crush'd by such thoughts, yet feeling here The sparks of some eternal fire Warm at the heart of my desire, Knowing some part of God is nearâ (For 'midst this ill-match'd human crew, Some have, like me, pow'r to create The idols that they consecrate, Others seem God-like, made like you), And if this ray of heav'nly fire (Seen or imagined, felt or guess'd, Rising in mine, or in your breast) Can cleanse my heart, and raise it higherâ Far from this surging sea below, To Him who sent it me, this beam, Like an unutter'd pray'r, may seem, The worship of the God I know; He (that great Pow'r by whom 'twas giv'n) May view with kind immortal eyes My soul's idolatry arise From you, my heav'n, to His high Heav'n. And as my flutt'ring pinions soar To those bright realms, where He may be, May pardon the sweet blasphemy Which makes me know and love Him more! And if, before me, o'er the wave Of far Eternity's blue sea, My Idol's soul should float, and be Commingled with the God who gave; Then, lifting up to His high throne The voice of an adoring pray'r (Feeling my whole of Heav'n is there), God and my Idol will seem one! âOH! LET IT BE FOR LONG!â If it is not for ever, Oh! let it be for long! Oh! do not too lightly sever A link so dear and so strong! Whilst I have pow'r to please thee, Whilst my poor presence charms, Never will I release thee, Thy prison shall be my arms! But when the spell is over That bids thee linger nigh, Then fly to another and love herâ She will love thee less than I. And when thy soft lip presses Hers, who more dear may be, The ghosts of my dead caresses Will glide between her and thee! Then e'en if not for ever, Oh, let it be for long! Oh! do not too lightly sever A link so dear and so strong! LOVE'S HOURS. The hours that we have pass'd together Would scarcely make one golden year, One golden year of sunny weather 'Midst other years of darkness drear, Though, spread upon the grass, our kisses, Would warm a space as broad as this is, From there to here! Stolen from a world of death and sorrow, These happy hours of life and bliss Enough of heav'nly joy can borrow, That Angels (could they look at this) Would surely shroud their wond'ring faces To see how much of Heaven's traces Lurk'd in a kiss! Oh! some have said that e'en the fleetness Of these dear hours we call our own, May lend them something more of sweetness Than would have clung to them alone. Ah! who can say? For who has striven To guess which pathway led to Heavenâ Once Heav'n is known? Yet, should'st thou deem that they have guess'd it, (The sages who have told us this), Then, would to Heav'n that I could test it, And cling for ever to thy kiss! Then should I know if 'tis the fleetness Of these dear hours that makes their sweetness, Or whether their exceeding fleetness Flows from their own surpassing sweetness, Or what it is! TO A PORTRAIT. I gaze once more upon your pictured face, Oh! you who made my weary life so glad! Till with the light I see within your eyes My soul is madden'd, and I almost fear To look, whilst I am missing you alone, Upon this tempting mockery of Heaven! Oh! all too faithful likeness of my love! He looks as when his arms embraced me last, When all the ardent azure of his eyes Look'd up towards me, melting into mine. Oh! cruel picture! passionate yet cold, Warm icy image of the one I love! Hide out of sight those lips I cannot kiss, And press'd against the heart that beats for him, Sleep till the dawn.âYet listen to my dreams (If that which has not voice may haply hear,) And when the gold that veils this eager glance Is warm and throbbing from my throbbing heart, Then will you learn the secrets of my soul And all my breast has hidden until now, For knowing that these speaking lips are mute I shall not fear to dream of Love and him. Good-night, dear Disappointment! all too like The one I love to make my slumber calm, Feeling the little golden chain that clasps Around the neck where once his arms have been! Good-night, so like him, and yet so unlike, To let me kiss and cling to you alone! Send me your kinder semblance in a dream, And let me pass away these hours of night With one so like to you, yet so unlike! A DREAM OF THE SOUTH. Often, when I am musing here alone, Slowly there fades from me this present scene, And other sights and sounds that once have been But are not now, crowd on me one by one. Sometimes the jing'ling voice of southern chimes Rung out from cupolas of painted tiles, Sometimes a black-eyed peasant woman smiles From some pink home, built as in warmer climes. Sometimes once more my spirit wanders through That garden with its fragrant orange-trees, And sees between the shining leaves of these Glimpses of tideless ocean, oh! so blue. Or else, I see a patch of rich red earth, Four foot-prints planted in it, and a vine, Blue-coated muleteers, in stragg'ling line, Coming with sounds of sweet-toned bells and mirth. A palm-tree which its drooping feathers spreads Above the painted gateway of a town With quaint dark streets, and, passing up and down, Women who knit, with loads upon their heads. What sentiment my heaving bosom fills At these remembrances, however small! The sharp black shadow of a sun-lit wall, The distant view of purple wooded hills! The pointed aloe, in its green glazed pot, The red-capp'd boatmen in the glitt'ring bay, The islands in the distance, far away, That it all look'd so bright I wonder not! Yet was it all so bright? I do not know; Perhaps it only seem'd so doubly fair Seen with four eyes, and ev'ry breath of air Breathed through four lips, but ah! it did seem so! These scenes a man and woman wander'd through, Their shadows falling on the dusty plain Seem'd sometimes to be one, then two again, Then melted into one, alas! then two! The peasants paused to watch them as they pass'd, And as the vines their sun-burnt fingers train Along the trellis-work of yellow cane, So did she cling to him, and hold him fast. They thought them bound by far more lawful ties Than those which join'd their lips and lock'd their hands, And made them wander thus in sunny lands Led by the light in one another's eyes! On, on, through all these flow'ry paths they roam Clinging together in the sunny glow, As only those can cling who seem to know They soon must part,âthat here is not their home! And as she clings, a voice she seems to hear Which says to her, âAlas! you still are two! No words that you can say,âno deeds you do Can make you one! Oh! to be still more near!â Sometimes she wish'd some danger would come near, Some sudden lightning-flash or robber's knife Or something threatening to take his life, So that she might cry, âSpare him, but strike here!â Thus to have died, sometimes she thought were best Than to live on through changes and through years, Knowing, alas! that all her future tears Could not be dried upon that loving breast! So, with strange fancies and with strange desires, They wander on (so seems it in my dream, For it may be these beings only seem, Or that some oft-told tale my thought inspires), They wander on, until, anon, a cloud Seems to enfold them darkly over head; Again they see the lightâthey are not dead, But something lies enveloped in a shroud! Further apart, yet casting longing eyes On the dear country they have left behind, Still stretching hand to hand, with fingers twined, And sighing for the warmth of those lost skies, Thus are they now (or so they seem to be); Then slowly do I put the picture by, Whilst a strange chilly wind, I know not why, Seems with its icy breath to blow on me: Longing for something that returns no more, The yearning after something left behind, Something that haply I might one day find Could I return again to that warm shore. These are the thoughts that animate my breast As these lost forms and scenes revive again, But what has been was sweet, and this dull pain Is not too dearly bought by all the rest! Sometimes I see that woman of my dream, And wonder if her breath can fan to light That yet warm memory of past delight Which still within her bosom seems to gleam. Sometimes I see the man that woman knew, Sometimes distinctlyâsometimes dim to me; Sometimes I say, âAh! yes, it must be he!â But ah! it is not he! (it is not you!) And if that man and woman ever meet In after-mood, and after other years, What they will say between their falling tears Will be, I think, â'Tis past, but it was sweet!â A REPROACH. Should you and I live on, my own, Till Time has made us old and grey, I, looking back, may haply say, âI marvel not that Time has flown So quickly! Cruel one!â (to you), âI blame you for those years that flew!â For had you never been to me What your dear lips have sworn you were, The slave of one who did not dare To own to you her slavery, And had your love ne'er brighten'd o'er The path that was so dark before: Then Time may be his wings had stay'd, And this mad clock had halted too, And both our lives had loiter'd through Their destined years of sun and shade; But since you made the years so bright, I do not wonder at their flight! Oh! do not let them lag, my own, These strangely variable hours! For then my life would miss the flow'rs The kisses of your mouth have sown: But do not make them fly too fast These blissful hours that cannot last. Oh! would, my love, that I had pow'r, (Since Time has proved so false a friend, And bids these happy moments end), To break the clock and stay the hour, And keep it standing on for aye At this dear hour that steals away! Oh! weeks and months and years that fly! Each blights some blossom midst the flow'rs With which youth crowns this life of ours, And fancies, faiths, and beauties die; But oh! I pray the gods may give To you the will to let this live! Oh! what I mean by âthis,â my own, Is something you and I have felt, When both our souls have seem'd to melt Into that something few have known; Too sacred this to write or rhyme, 'Twas this that urged the wings of Time! Then let us love them now, my own, These days and nights of dear delight! And may the thought that they were bright Cheer our sad lives when Love has flown, Though now I feel my heart must die, Before my love for you will fly! AH! REMEMBER. Darling remember! Do not hide in darkness All the small nothings that recall me to you! The thousand little things, which but to glance at Must even force an alter'd heart to ponder, Oh! do not cast the âYou and Iâ for ever Out of the life that may be lived without me, Or, like a closed-up volume that is finish'd, Put not the story we have read together Upon the crowded shelf to lie forgotten! Ah! remember! Remember all the days before we reach'd it (Our gate of heaven where we sat in sunshine), The eager hopeful days, the days of sorrow, The days of doubt, and all the days of longing, And that one day, a day that was predestined, And that one hour that bore within its bosom The sixty little moments of our madness, And oneâthe maddest, and, alas! the fleetestâ! Ah! remember! Ah! yes, remember! All the heath was golden, Ten thousand budding flowers told of spring-tide, And all my heart was warm with it and sadden'd, The sun-light splash'd the fern with yellow patches, The voices of the birds said âLove me! Love me!â I listen'd to the birds, I watch'd the insects That flutter'd captive thro' the snowy mazes Of the white dress I wore to welcome summer; I watch'd, as in a dream, the home-returning Of million flies and bees all honey-laden; And all the world seem'd warm with Love and Summer,â Waiting, I knew not why, but still for something, Longing, I knew not why, but still for some one, When on the garden gravel fell a footstep, And all my soul knew wherefore it was waiting, And both our hearts were warm with Love and Summerâ! Ah! remember! Ah! then remember, when the day was fading, And all the southern sea was flush'd and rosy, We watched it hand in hand, all loth to lose itâ The happy daylight that had shone upon us! Half blinded with the glory of the sunset, Its beauty drew our longing lips together, And we forgot the sunset in our kissesâ! Ah! remember! Remember too, those ev'nings in the Winter, When, by the glowing hearth, with candles shaded, I sat and waited, longing for your coming! I did not wait you long, my own! my darling! For scarcely had the first clock finished striking When on the stair I heard your eager footstep. The door is closed upon usâwe are silent, My warm lips strive to thaw the breath of Winter Upon your cheek, and kiss the chilly clusters Of the dear curly head upon my bosom. Oh! when I am not near, in other winters, Or when, may be, another's arms enfold you, Ah! remember! Remember, too, the daybreak of our parting; For, by the flickering light of future fires, One of our two poor hearts must watch in sadness. Which will it be? Then, in the summer weather, The sun will seem all mockery in his brightness, And all the many words one would have spoken, Will die unutter'd; then by sunny fountains, And by the shores of that dear tideless ocean, A stricken soul will wander, heavy hearted. Ah! if it should be you, then in the twilight, Watching the sunset we have watch'd so often, Your shadow falling where ours fell together, Or when you see the open empty window, Where once these eyes of mine look'd out their welcome, And tread again the pathway we ascended, Ah! remember! Remember, ah! but do not with a shudder, Turn from the memory. Oh! let me linger A little in your life when mine is ended! Not as a living thing, but as great rivers Sometimes conceal some secret undercurrent, So let me be to you. Of thoughts and fancies, Let me be still the queenâyour soul my kingdom, My feeble sceptre, all your mem'ry clings to. Oh! I would rule your soul by written letters, Or by the silent lips of painted pictures, By books that we have read, by thoughts and actions, By spoken words, and words that are unspoken, (For maybe you will guess, should I be absent, The thought that would have flashed across my spirit At this or that.) In all the pleasant places, By tideless seas, in those blue skies unclouded, There would I like to hover near my darling, And hand in hand, unchanged, unseparated, Cling on through time and tide to some great ending, Or some beginning of some new to-morrow! Ah! remember! Oh! let us by united will, endeavour To open unimagined gates of meeting, And scale all former fences of division! Ah! well-explored, yet undiscover'd country, To those who linger still in doubt and darkness; To some fond few, to whom Earth has been Heaven, The dim Siberia of their banishment; But to so many more the hoped-for haven, Where all their batter'd barks find anchorage; To meet you there, or feel some influence, To tell me you are present in the spirit, We needs must triumph over Death and distance; And that your after-eyes may see and know me, I say to you at ev'ry earthly parting, âAh! remember!â ALONE AT THE TRYST. Here, in the home of newly vanish'd love, A thousand things recall my heart's delight, A thousand silent witnesses unite To say, â'Twas here we saw your kisses prove The waneless love of noonday and of night That warms your being!â All around the air Seems freighted with those dear delights that were, And now are past. The clock, that seems to move Unlike the headlong time-piece of those days, Ticks with a sad distinctness, and it says To my lone heart, âI am the self-same clock Whose veering hands your own would once have stay'd, As, gazing at me wond'ring and aghast To think that happy moments flew so fast, You wrapp'd your cloak around you, half afraid, And vanish'd through yon door, whereon your knock Seem'd scarcely to have diedâso quick I pass'd From minute unto quarter, racing on From half to whole, until I struck at last The doom of that sweet hour that now is gone!â Ah! with how sad a heart I wander here, From room to room, that seem so full of him, Half thinking, as the Autumn light grows dim, That he is only late, and must be near! Or that my longing over land and sea Will reach my love, and bring him back to me! Vain foolish hope! and yet I wait and wait, Foolish and vain though my poor hope may be; The sad slow clock has told me it is late, And in my heart of hearts alas! I know That far away, with hills and vales between My darling cannot feel, and has not seen My little flitting shadow come and go And wait and watch and weep for what has been! Oh! âfar away!â our journeys lie apart; Yet here, for some few hours in some short years We mingle for awhile our hopes and fears, And cling together straining heart to heart. Ah! in a life of bitterness and tears How do I treasure thisâits happiest part! Come back to me, dear Idol! for the shrine Seems sad without you, and the bird will pine In the lone nest all empty of her mate! Come, where around all seems to watch and wait, Where even now the very walls and floors Hope for your shadow and expect your tread, Come to my longing breast and rest your head, And shut the cold world out with these dear doors! CALM AND STORM. It is not often that we really love: We have our frenzies and our ecstasies, But that sweet tenderness when storms are past, Or when, becalmed, we wait the hour of storm, This, this is little cared for here on earth! Upon thy breast my head is resting now, And, shaken by the throb of that dear heart, I cannot sleep, but thinking, half awake, I wonder which is sweetest, calm or storm, And, answering to my fickle woman's heart, A thousand sad soft voices murmur âCalm!â Ah! trust me not, my lips are too near thine; And ere thy heart is quiet, like that bird That whirls and eddies over foaming seas, My traitor soul is longing for the storm! âTHE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS.â Call them not past, though those bright days are ended, And in the sea those autumn suns have set; Woven into my life they are, and blended With all its sunshine, and I follow yet In fancy those dear paths we two ascended; And though these days are darken'd by regret, It is not for a dead thing I am sighing: I weep no vanish'd joys, for in my heart, Living for ever to me, underlying The current of the life I live apart From what seems more than life, there, there, undying, Is what thou wert to me, and what thou art! And to these sunless days that thought gives glory, And warm to this my heart, that would wax cold Without its magic, do I tell the story Of all that (had they voices) might unfold Those spreading beech trees and those oak-trees hoary, Beneath whose tangled branches, uncontrolled We wander'd hand in hand, and join'd to living The happiness of living in the rays Of our hearts' sun. Ah! stern and unforgiving And cold may be this world and all its ways; Yet in the midst of present tears and striving Shines like a star the light of those dear days. Well were they worth these moments of my sorrow, And all the thorny paths through which we went To reach our Heaven; and I strive to borrow Some glimmer of the radiance they lent, To light me now, so that on this, the morrow, Looking towards them, I can feel content! LANCELOT AND GUINEVERE. âOh! read to me some other lay,' She cried to one about to read; âI love to hear of tourney gay, Of feats of arms and daring deed, âYet read to-day some simple rhyme, Or else some tender ballad sing, And let me hear another time The Idylls of the blameless king.â Her husband did not seem to hear, Or, if he heard, he heeded not, And so he read of Guinevere And of her love for Lancelot. He read how first the rumour grew, Unheard by him it harm'd the most, And how the courtiers link'd their two Unwedded names in song and toast; And how, âlove-loyalâ to her will, The great knight sought within her eyes Her wishes when her lips were still, Ere striving for the diamond prize, And how he did not read them rightâ The lady sadden'd at each word: âAlas,â she sigh'd, âhow true the knight! How fair the queen! how great her lord!â She turn'd away and sigh'd anew As in each act his love was seen, And thought, âAh! I had loved him too Were he my knight, were I his queen.â But when the poet told of how His guilty love had darken'd o'er, And marr'd the beauty of his brow (Such love makes some men smile the more), And how he did not lightly wear The prize of which he made no boast, 'Twas then she deem'd him doubly fair, 'Twas then she felt she loved him most. And when she heard of fair Elaine, âAlas! it seemeth hard,â she sigh'd, âThat he should let her love in vain The hopeless love whereof she died. âBut ah! how loyal to his queen! How warm the heart that seem'd so cold! Hath ever knight so faithful been Since he of whom the poet told?â And when she heard how Elaine died, And floated to him on her bier, She turn'd away her head to hide The falling of a passing tear. But when Sir Lancelot had sought The little reedy river cove, And, all remorseful, sigh'd and thought The maiden's was the tend'rer love; Then throbb'd the heart of her who heard, As though the spirit of the queen Within her bosom lived and stirr'd, And made of her what she had been: And wildly to herself she said, âThe woman's love! the queen's! my own! Ah! could he covet in its stead What but a love-sick girl has shown? âThe sneering word, the tarnish'd name, The galling mask for him she bore; She heeded not her loss of fame, And risk'd the queenly crown she wore: âFor him she did not scorn to lie To one whose very life was truth; She put her robes and sceptre by, And crown'd him king of all her youth. âThat simple maiden could but prove The love she bore him by her death; Give me to live for him I love, To yield him heart and soul and breath! âGive me the risk, the shame, the sin, The love that can have nought to gain, Save the fond hope one day to win A dearer link to clasp the chain! âBut read no more!â she cried aloud; Her cheek was flush'd and wild her eye, Whilst on her brow the gath'ring cloud Told of the tempest passing by. âAh! read no more,â she said again, âMy ears are weary of the sound!â And half in anger, half in pain, She flung the book upon the ground. âAlas, for lawless love!â she sigh'd, âI share the cross of Guinevere; Like her my guilty secret hide, Like her I earn the doom I fear. âTo see one day his passion fade, Or hear him say mine pales beside The love of some such lily maid As she who floated down the tide. âFor me to steel my heart at need, Nor let that live that makes love's curse, Then can I all unheeding read The tender tales of poet's verse.â She bent her head and seem'd to pray, Then, starting, listen'd to a sound, Push'd back her hair, and dash'd away The tears in which her eyes were drown'd. With mantling cheeks and lips apart, She waits and strains her anxious sight; And all the pulses of her heart Seem quicken'd by some near delight. Her lord stepp'd down upon the grass And vanish'd in the twilight dim; Her guardian angel moan'd âAlas! Alas for her! alas for him!â Alas! for erring woman's pray'r! Reader and book alike forgot; She trembles, hearing on the stair The coming step of Lancelot.</field>
