      <field name="fulltext">HISTORICAL ODES AND OTHER POEMS. Wellington: a Historical Ode. I. INTRODUCTION. Brothers; we met around a father's grave A few swift years ago: the earth we clave As breathless with our loss as we had been With triumphs, when upon a hundred plains We followed him, where flashed the steel more keen, The battle spread in redder stains. Then looked we back upon his life, that road Of victory, secure and long and broad, With patience paved and virtue, Roman way, Grand march of life heroic, which he drew, His children paced; it leads from far Assaye, And thence returns to Waterloo. Peace was his end; 'twas well; he wrought for peace That iron road: his war made war to cease. No other hand could stay the reign of blood, The Fury Revolution, who had come Of ancient tyranny, the monstrous brood That leaped with groaning from the womb. Think, brothers, living in a peaceful time Of all the ravage, all the public crime, The fields they fought, when earth was heaped with slain, And mourned to be one open burial-place; The fleets they filled, whose relics strewed the main; Yearned Ocean o'er the human race. The lust, the rage, the blood, the agony; The horror-stricken nations dismally Labouring out they knew not what: the end Which comes not yet, O brothers! now was come The Fury Revolution, child of fiend, That leaped with groaning from the womb. She came; her soul despair, her body death: The systems shrivelled, as she drew her breath; Dagons before her, headless, handless, fell; The CÃ¦sars' empire withered at her frown; Then she allied her with the infidel, And ancient right was smitten down. Blind, self-tormenting, raging, fiend of Dante, In force of furious scope, in vision scanty, She struck at friends as foes, but most abhorred The homes of freedom on the hills and seas; Heroic Reding fell beneath her sword, And England watched her on the breeze. Republics round her she affiliated; Then gave her chieftains kingdoms reinstated: She came in anarchy, and she became A despotism so dreadly centralized, That later tyranny directs her aim Backward: no more can be devised. She came: La VendÃ©e sank in mitraillades; The Loire, the Seine, were sickened with noyades: Then coil o'er coil, she stretched in dragon might, Till half the continent was made her lair; Her eagle plumes waved shadows black as night, Her dragon whorls did crush and tear. She came with thunderous march of vertebrate Procession; fenced in iron, grinding weight Of cannon; rank by rank of men who wound O'er mountains, undulated over plains, Successive, ceaseless; blood her mornings crowned, Her dews of night were bloody rains. Then battle grew a fiend, and monstrous Death Exulted by sweet river and wild heath; A shameless leper grinning at his sores; He bathed in Danube, Scheldt, and Rhine, and Po, He yelled with joy in burning Moscow's roars, He rolled himself in Eylau's snow. He sowed the dragon's teeth; the brood that sprung He did conscribe, when they were over-young, Into his hated service, forced to war Ere truly they had left their mother earth: Nature sufficed not; every natal star Poured bloody runes upon its birth. Then rose the nations maddened with their wrong: The German brothers sang the people's song; Then Hofer fell, and from his fall the brand Passed westward, southward; in the Pyrenees His Alpine echoes rang; the Spanish land Rose like a lion from its knees. Rose lion-like; but fell beneath the blows Of myriad hunters; legions of fierce foes Ravaged and slew from iron shore to shore: Fell vengeful Saragossaâall in vainâ Gerona sank beside her: it was o'er; The new Saguntum bled again. Then, like the angel of the sea and land, Rose England for the struggling right to stand, Resolved that now her arms should flash anew In battle on the land as on the main; Resolved to efface the failures hithertoâ Toulon, Dunkirk, and Walcheren,â And to outshine Corunna's setting sun. And it was e'en thy hand, O Wellington, Should raise our standard where it gleamed of yore Upon the crest of wildest battle-wave: An ancient right that triple cross upbore The agonizing world to save. And England owned herself in thee: her staid And speechless courage into virtue made, Her patience into faith, which only sees The spreading splendours breaking through the clouds, And builds up peace from thousand victories, And glory from a million shrouds. Oh, mighty worker, mighty watcher! who Remained save thee, save thine what work to do? Nelson was gone, and Pitt had followed him; Their work was done, yet still the strife increased, The agony, the rending limb by limb, The cruel demon at his feast. Footfall by footfall, line by line advanced Thy liberation, thought on thought enhanced Thy purpose; over armÃ¨d heads of chiefs Till then unmatched, and launched like thunderbolts By the gigantic grasper of king-fiefsâ Massenas, Marmonts, Soultsâ Thy triumph lay, until the lord of all With his full might met thine. His Satan fall Made earth a heaven, and set thy glory o'er Death's reach; thy glory to efface, the fount Of time must backward to its sources pour, The sum of years the heavens remount. II. THE PENINSULAR WAR. 1. The Crisis of Europe. Spain's insurrection sank; one city held Her senate; and her armies strewed Her swart sierras. âAll shall be subdued,â The despot cried, who ever yet had felled The neck of opposition; who had spelled The nations with a charm of blood. Wherefore from Wagram, flushed and carnage-fed, His legions pour; his iron horsemen tread The Spanish flowers, his iron guards; the throng Ends not; to where our little army waits, Spain's latest hope, they close; as torrent strong They close, they close; Massena leads their fates. Ne'er yet had ebbed that battle-tide which rode As one wide sea from Vistula To Douro; rising, dancing in the ray Of victor suns: and now, behold, it flowed To meet the Atlantic with a wave as proud: One rock alone opposed the way. For it had risen year by year, and gained In huge encroachments, till no more remained A barrier of resistance south or east: At Austerlitz and Friedland, Russia shrunk; At Jena and at Wagram, Prussia ceased, And Austria and all the centre sunk. All silent now beneath those rolling waves, Which covered all the wrecks of things, And rolled alike o'er nations and their kings. What whisper now within those glutted graves, While half the world was made the despot's slaves, And poured in tears its offerings? What whisper, save that England now had sent Her little army to the Continent? What hope, except that to the Southern west, The Northern west was sending tardy aidâ England to Spain? Ah, were it not a jest To breathe such solace to the world dismayed? Seemed it not bitter mockery to say That the few thousands landed now On Lusian shore, should dare to wait a foe Of hundred thousands three, the tidal way Of universal overflow to stay? And yet in very truth 'twas so. âThe wave that brought the islanders shall be Their sepulchre; we drive them to the sea: The Emperor wills; no toil remains save this; Then Rome's dominion, Rome's renown is ours; Corunna re-enact, and storm Cadiz.â Massena leads along his vaunting powers. Right onward drives the gathered hurricane; Its wreathing furious flakes invest And scourge the land; as thunder on its crest Sits Death; recede before it toward the main Our gathered arms; the sun to set is fain; Our sun seemed setting in the west. So fierce the onset that it seemed as ne'er Had Talavera been; a great despair One moment palsied England:ââHome; allow Free course to fate: return, the blow decline.â Ah, then, my father, then no other brow Was calm; no other hand prepared, save thine. No other soul than thine perceived that there, In the remote Peninsula, The hope of Europe's disenthralment lay. This was the consummation thou didst dare; For this didst thou the greatest war prepare That e'er did England's might array. For this wast thou contented there to wield The sword against each marÃ©chal; From Spain was Rome assailed by Hannibal; And, when thy prophet hopes should be fulfilled, Thence didst thou issue to the final field: CÃ¦sar returned on Rome from Gaul. 2. As he who limns a picture cannot trace Each separate form in field or wood, That dwells in distance broken and subdued, And blended in the gradual purple haze; He masses all in mighty rounds of space And hues of magic brotherhood. So I from out a hundred deeds must choose Three which most mighty were; the rest confuse In the deep distance of that atmosphere Of time that doth embrace and shroud them all: Let life heroic its own mystery wear, And art be but a limner mystical. For Torres Vedras turned the scale of fate Inclining it to victory, When England's sun seemed hasting to the sea; Half Spain did Salamanca liberate; Vittoria rolled the war through Gallia's gate: The hero struck; his strokes were three. 3. Torres Vedras. Lo, that first miracle: the lines entraced On leagues of Lusian shore, when we were chased By fell Massena's power! Who wrought them so In secret, suddenly to rise and quell With thrice three hundred cannon mouths the foe, To stay pursuit with might inflexible; Like Grecian wall before the galleys reared, Which even Hector stormed in vain; Who wrought them so, demands the baffled train: For lo, when swift the expected triumph neared, Those triply ordered battlements appeared Between the eagles and the main. A month they lay there, hopeless to assail, Loth to retreat. Then first that tide did fail Which flooded half the world; it turned, they turned; Fell back the surges of the iron sea, Gleaming in hundred villas grimly burned, Sounding in thousand cries of agony. It was begun; the huge recoil which drew Pursuit to Paris, where it stayed. Europe revives: in German forest's shade The Austrian, stiff in arms, doth strength renew Against his giant foe; the Russian, too, In awestruck ranks hath knelt and prayed. 4. Salamanca. Arose the twelfth year from the century: Oh, Fate! two men were working diversely In east and west, regardant each of other: Napoleon's zenithâsoon his star shall slope; Wellington's dawn: one fate involves another; One's glory gives the other's horoscope. One crossed the Nieman, one the Aguada; Invading empires both, they go To Ciudad Rodrigo, to Smolenskoâ To Borodino, to Vittoriaâ To Moscow, to Madrid; our victor day Napoleon saw through Russian snow. From Torres Vedras they have turned; and, lo, Pursuit usurps the place of overthrow; Swift is our wingÃ¨d lion on his way: Almeina sinksâno arts avert her fall; Rodrigo sinksâcan blood her doom repay? Badajos sinksâcan blood rebuild her wall? Then rose the scene of war so strange and grand, When Marmont came to stay the rout; When side by side the mighty foes marched out Toward the battle place which each had planned; There front to front shall France and England stand, And lift again the battle shout. Parallel rolled for leagues their columns, till O'er Salamanca each his chosen hill Had covered: there for many days they clung Like thunder-clouds in scarce suspended strife; Gerizim, Ebul; on those mountains hung For Spain the curse or blessing, death or life. Then came the mighty shock; who does not know That Blenheim of our century; That glorious battle turned to victory By that heroic hand from blow to blow, What time the mighty lion smote his foe Upon the mountains deathfully? And Marmont saw the greatest host that e'er The Gaul had gathered, scattered into air In one short hour; and vain were all his wiles, In vain his lengthened columns doth he pour, In vain reconcentrates his broken files; The shattered eagle shall he lift no more. Deluded slaves who served the tyrant's will, Gay sons of France; the young, the bold, Your glorious pride the bloody sods enfold; Your mothers wait you where the orchards fill, And all your hopes are scattered on that hill Where dies a myriad doubly told. And the feigned king fled headlong from Madrid; Back sank the eagles; half of Spain was rid Of them for ever: ne'er they crossed again Morena's armed sierra; Cadiz woke From her environment, the iron chain Forged in three years of war the captive broke. More glorious sun for England never set: Glorious the triumph which ye share, Oh, warrior children, with your father there; Oh, England's warrior children, ye who let The Bengal noontide feed upon your sweat, The Crimean frost your vitals wear. Napoleon heard on Borodino's eve The fatal news, refusing to believe; And in the Kremlin to his ears there came, Lone in the Kremlin with his destiny, The Russian salvoes pouring glad acclaim, âMadrid is occupied, half Spain is free.â 5. Vittoria. Havoc, the miserable child of War, Murder, and Rapine, cursed crew, Hispania bore you; on her breast ye drew As lengthened furrows as did ever scar, As smouldering ruin raised, as e'er did char Earth's quaking bosom smitten through. By many a rushing river to the sea Hispania's corpses rolled; o'er hill and lea Her vultures sailed for carrion; many a maid And wife by savage soldiery defiled Fell, olive-pale, with deathly lips that prayed O'er murdered father, husband, lover, child. Many a palace nodded to its fall; Those Moorish gateways, arched so wide, Opened on court-yards red from side to side With glaring blood on marble floor and wall, And heapÃ¨d dead; the cloister, turned to stall, Held Death's wild horses from their ride. But now the hour is come when they who guard So well their own home-island from the sword, Shall finish that for which they crossed the main, And from the bloody spoiler rescue thee; And, because England frees thee, thou, O Spain, The first of all the nations shalt be free. From Salamanca count a year of toil, A winter's respite; then anew Begins that march which shall the foe subdue Without one pause from all the Spanish soil: Vittoria's march: disgorging blood and spoil The shattered eagle homeward flew. The double columns move: the Gaul they sweep From Douro backward to the northern deep: No more Valladolid shall lothe the state Of Gaulish marshal insolent: no more Biscayan ports their stores accumulate; That sweep superb has freed the northern shore. While from Madrid their central army fled: Fled, rapine-gorged, the official crew Which long had sucked a nation's life; they drew An endless spoil along; their hope, they said, Beside Bayonne to meet their crownÃ¨d head; Ah, first they met the vengeance due. Within thy soul, great chieftain, was designed That wondrous march; as faithfully combined By every column-leader under thee; Each day's advance was measured, till at last We came upon Vittoria suddenly, Where lay their cumbered army, swollen and vast. Vittoria, thou whose very name doth sound Of victory, where vengeance just Fell on those sons of murder and of lust, Where one more righteous stroke to death did wound A kingly hydra-head, where fell discrowned King Joseph 'neath the final thrust! O'er bridge and hill our legions burst their way; The skirmish changed to battle; battle's bray Died in disastrous carnage, foulest rout, While melted all away the unwieldy host; And far arose one agonizing shout, One Beresina-wail when all was lost. For all was lost; their relics strewed the plain; Five years of pillage in a day Lost; all the archives of that monstrous sway Lost; and their latest army left in Spain Lost, lost; but never lost the death and pain, The bleeding witnesses who pray. The hero struck; his strokes were three; the third Through Europe sounded; doubting Austria heard, Flung back the treacherous hand he offered her, The giant evil-doer in his need: âJoin, Russians, join around his bristling lair, Let Germany be freed as Spain is freed.â Farewell to Spain, ye spoilers, ye who laved In blood your footsteps o'er her plains; Your day is done, your guilt alone remains. The vulture, not the eagle, see, hath waved His vans among the mountains; he had craved A draught that drops from his own veins. 6. They fled, close followed, to the Pyrenees, The strife through all the winter did not cease; Fell San Sebastian, Pampeluna fell, Another Frankish rout saw Roncesvalles; The Bidassoa, the Nive, and the Nivelle In vain oppose swift stream and bristling wall. Farewell to Spain; farewell the lurid waste Of desert tracked by muleteer, O'er which the dark sierra ridges rear Their bastions; farewell ancient cities placed In paradises, old Alhambras chased With Saracenic scroll severe. Through those dark Pyrenean glens did crawl Those matchless foes; no wintry storms appal; Like wrestling snakes they wound from rock to rock; Now, Gallia, feel the war-dogs thou didst loose: In vain is Orthe's bloody battle shock, In vain the volleying ridges of Toulouse. And there the struggle ended; for, from east And north the nations thronging on Had pressed the giant despot from his throne: But first 'midst all was England's flag released To gales of France, and vengeance first did feast Those who had fought by Wellington. 7. Farewell to Spain for those who fought the fight, The iron men who showed the English might, Trained by thine eye and fashioned by thy skill To be thy perfect instrument of war, To march, to fight, untired, invincible; âNo army like the old Peninsular.â No chiefs like that renownÃ¨d school of men Who wrought thy bidding, bore with thee A worthy portionâPicton, Ponsonby, Hill, Crawford, Graham, Beresford; in ken As eagles, lion-like in daring when The battle rolled in mystery. The bones of forty thousand Englishmen Mix with the dusts of Spain; thy freedom then, Hispania, cost so much: they toiled, traversed, Marched, counter-marched, and fought and bled and died, With him who saw the last from doubtful first, And bore them through those empire-lists so wide. No hero therefore like the man who gained His glory as the common good; The elder brother of the men who stood Beside him, not a demi-god sustained On blinded adulation; who remained Unstaggered both by gold and blood. From Spanish brides who wept upon the shore The ordered transports all that army bore; Fond creatures who had marched and camped with them Long years; whom never may they see again. They go; great England with her diadem Leans o'er the purple seas: Farewell to Spain. Yet is their work unended: lo, once more Swoons Europe in the very smile Of new-born peaceâagain the eagles soar, Again the life-consuming cannon roar, And horror-struck despair comes down; the while The Continent implores the Isle. III. WATERLOO. 1. Came down on Gallia, PÃ¨re la Violette: His veterans named him so, and sternly set His martial blazon on their breasts again; Long had they mourned his absence with the pain Of devotees, their idol cast in shade; They bore him on their shields, while fled dismayed Legitimacy, and the realm was his. The smile was withered on the lips of peace; The congress of the kings, that met To arbitrate on crowns, was scattered far By the fierce look of war. Nor wholly undeserved their overset, For golden languor, pleasure, vulgar thought, Hollow ambition, had invaded them; And that pacification ill was wrought Which sunk the right below the diadem, And yielded Poland to the Czar. Napoleon, e'en in that eleventh hour Had thy vast soul recalled its godlike power To utter freedom to the world, and be, What God designs in all, and so designed in theeâ Yet one more issue to infinityâ Then were thy doom a thing of woe; but now The light of truth had left thy brow, The early hope which 'neath Italian skies To thee drew wistful eyes, When thy inspirÃ¨d face uplifted glowed In each victorious sunset on thy road Of blameless battle for thy country fought, Not for thine empire; big with thought, Pathetic, in the passion of its youth Begetting noble truth. Now sensual ambition, mastering all, Had made that soul a thrall; And all thy thoughts were faded and grown old, Not leading progress to the goal of gold; And he who wrought thine overthrow, Leading the men who laboured to restore The limitations of the age before, He thy conqueror, he thy foe, Was heaven's own champion for the rights of man. Thine eagle fell behind; his lion led the van. 2. For all the earth, grown weary, sick, distressed With bloody toil, now in the pause of rest Beheld the work of war again begin, The scourge of God returned. Long since akin To war all hearts had grown; men had been born Through whose whole life the earth had never worn The look of peace; a generation bred In battle, wrack, and flame, and nourished With such like horrors into deadly mood: And these in that first respite of their blood Must clutch to them their iron arms again, Resume their marches, slaughter, and be slain. Loud-shouting war is here once more; loud war Roars for more prey; the cannon-bearing car Shall thunder through the land, career, and spread Its nitrous vapours o'er the gory bed Of battle, as the flying thunder wrack Whirls through the space of heaven; the dreadful track Of squadron rivers through battalion fields Once more their eyes shall mark; the Fury yields No hope, no change save that from life to death. So be it, answered they, with quiet breath; And took once more their places in the strife Hopeless and careless; fate had set their life This one mere task; their children would come next, It was begun again. Thus unperplexed The Antichrist they saw returned, and gave Themselves to feed the iron-surging wave That now was setting toward the Gallic shore From Belgium to the Czar, resigned once more To meet encroaching Fate with tranquil phlegm: Scythe-stroke by scythe-stroke Death might gather them, And year by year; it was begun once more. 3. Not so; no gradual swirl Of closing waves the Pagod down did hurl, But one great battle-shock O'erthrew the towering rock; The mighty deed which all the world reprieved One arm alone in one great hour achieved. 4. There lies a plain in Belgic land beside War's nursling, Brussels; heavy fields divide Two gentle slopes that ridge the vale between, And on each flank a forest wraps the scene. 'Tis holy ground; it is the grave of war; 'Tis yearly hallowed; children come from far, And weep upon the consecrated sod Such tears as follow blood; 'tis gently trod By all the great with awfulness; and there The skies more solemn roll, such sepulchre Rises to meet them; there the cloud and sun Have stranger issues, and the whitening moon More mutely melancholy muses there; For shrouding terror still enwraps the lair Of such a deed: this grandeur is for us, There stands the lion on our tumulus. And there are laid in sleep, as day is done (Ligny was lost, and Quatre Bras was won), Two mighty hosts; the rain-cloud o'er them broods, And night falls on them; those dark solitudes Are full of slumberous life; the watch-fires glare On readied cannon through the foggy air. Death waits the morning in these lists prepared; Here meet at last the champions who have shared The world's renown between themâEurope's scourge, Spain's liberator; both of them shall merge All other opposition in this fate: Round each of them their paladins await, Those iron souls whom they to arms had trained; And their tired armies sleep; by sleep unchained To vision each the other's mighty deeds. The fateful morning breaks; the dark recedes, The camp fires die; the expectant shudder runs Through moveless ranks; the bravest warrior shuns The dreadful moment ere the work begin. Oh, countryment, I tell you, lose or win, That such another moment never shook Time's hour-glass; never such another look Of doubtful Mars so horrent, ere it booms, The iron bell of battle; ere the drums Throb, and the fifes shrill, and exultantly The flame of battle lights the soldier's eye. Yet tender were your hearts, my countrymen, As was your courage dauntless. Who can pen With undimmed eye that scene before the fray, When ye embraced as brothers, with the bray Of death within your ears, and kissed, and gave Last words and gifts for those beyond the wave, If he survived who took them: tender, true, Loyal; how he would dare full well ye knew, Who led your ranks, and well ye knew the foe. How then stood England now let England know; How stood our fathers then, when death and fame Made covenant within the battle flame; How stood they in the whirlwind of that fight. They stood unmoved, when on the adverse height The great Opposer gathered in his hands Thunder and cloud, its shade; made firm the bands Of massive columns ordered for attack, And in his art, as masking these, made slack His swarms of skirmishers; as great was he, Be it not doubted, in his strategy, As ever upon Austrian battle-plain: Nor e'er did army labour to sustain Its old renown as the vast host he led: Filled were its ranks with traitors perjurÃ¨d, Who had for him forsworn their lawful king; With desperate gamblers, who their all did fling With his great cast for empire: needs must they In this prodigious hazard fiercely play, Now, as with clashing music, and the storm Of louder shouts, the battle line they form In splendid show, as if the very sight Of their bold marshalling with dread should smite. No clashing music led our fathers on; Less splendidly in arms their cohorts shone. They stood when first the opened cannonade Lifted death's shroud to heaven from field and glade; They stood when in a gloom of fire the bolts Whole ranks in pieces dashed; the soul revolts To watch their patient ranks, still formed anew As death dissolves them: fewer stand the few. They stood, they knelt, upon the bloody sod, Lifting the prayer of battle unto God: Each square so thinning as the day wore on Was filled with martyrs who by blood atone Sad earth with heaven. Others have dared to die, In headlong charge; others as steadfastly Have stood behind entrenchment and stone wall: They on the naked earth dared stand and fall, Gathered in islet squares so small and few. They stood, while all the daylong battle through Each act of war upon their front was tried: While dragon-breathÃ¨d guns sent thick and wide Their furious tempest, doubling stroke on stroke; While came assailing columns through the smoke Weighty and vast, in densest order pressed, And crushing forward up the hilly crest; While the mailed horsemen, riding thousands strong In constant onset poured the vale along; Riding in thousands, never prouder flower Of chivalry in battle-bed did bower; Striving by steel, by force, by weight, to hew Their passage through those islet squares so few. For all our centre was one tossing sea Of plumÃ¨d horsemen, and all furiously For three long hours the battle spray arose Where round the scarce-seen squares the riders close: The battle glory there, the yellow drift, The steel-blue sea of weapons, wildly swift, Its long and deadly billows doth outpour; So that he said, who ruled that desperate hour, That the defence full soon must buried be In ruin; sore amazed was he to see The inundating charges still subside, And still the rocks emerge from out the dying tide. They stood while all the daylong battle raged In such a wise; those two grand peers engaged Each art of war, and still Napoleon gained No mastery, though his army's blood had rained; For each assailing column had been rent, Those flooding charges all were vainly spent. There came with eve a lull; each furious gun A moment intermitted, as the sun Went sadly westward; will he leave the fight Ere upon total ruin sink the night? Not so; too savagely the battle lowers: The Guards remain, the latest of his powers, The breakers of resistance, they who tamed The Russian and the German, and were named The proudest soldiers in that warrior day; The grand reserve that still inclined the fray, When all was desperate; that still was cast A thunderbolt the dreadest and the last; The Guards; he cannot fly while these remain. They stoodâour fathersâwhen the bloody plain Grew black with that vast phalanx; still they stood, As calm as he who ruled their attitude, As awfully reserved; and, lo, their foes Are midway now the valley, now they close, And mount the slope with England's battle lined; Serried, enormous, black, they come; the wind Bears upward their stern shouting; bristling arms And flashing step, they come. The deep alarms Of our concentric fire proclaims how high The danger; each cleared volley shows more nigh; Though death consumes the mighty column's head, They come, and still with dauntless ranks they thread The dreadful open where the volleys meet, And make one street of fire, with death to choke that street. Still they re-form beyond it, grim and sternâ Still recommence their march; they almost turn Our hill-crest; they are here! Behold them now, Behold the pallid frowning of their brow Beneath the giant bearskin shaking o'er it; The waving eagle see; 'tis they who bore it Through Austerlitz and Jena, every breast Crossed with the belt where honour's star doth rest. Their graspÃ¨d bayonets see; behold them here. They paused an instant, as in wondering fear: Is opposition dead? They do but see An empty space before them. Can it be That England's line is pierced, the battle done? Who knows not how that moment great was won? How at our captain's voice from covert sprung Our fathers, they who all the day had clung To that contested hill; how, overborne By one fierce charge, struggling, confounded, torn, The mighty hostile column paused at last, Was huddled as a cloud by sudden blast, And fled? who knows not in a moment more How all was lost? Our shouting legions pour Down that all-bloody slope which they had held. Came Prussia from the wood with guns that knelled Vengeance, and pounded into utter rout Into the deepening night they stagger out: All lost, Napoleon turned his rein, and fled. Yet who is victor here? Behold the dead Rolled on the clammy sod; the victor seeâ Death, Death! his form arises solemnly In that wide reek that labours into air, As leaves the rout the scene of their despair; Victors and vanquished leave it, Death remains. His sulphurous shroud floats from the battle plains, And in it, thinning toward the darkened stars, His face smiles downward; many dropping scars And bloody locks o'erhang its features vast; Gloating and swollen it dissolved and passed. Falls weeping night; the smoke of Huguemont Grows lurid in the dark; then wildly haunt The hideous scene white flames that slowly creep, By fearful women borne, from heap to heap. Some come with knives to butcher them that cry, Some with death-shriek to faint on them that die. Far range the hills of death; the weakly moon Rains ashen light upon the ruin strewn: The dreadful mounds of relics of the slain, The headlong horses tumbled down amain, The limbs that seem to struggle yet, the gleam On pallid forms, the black mysterious stream That never came from heaven: there, as by fits The light falls on them, one in fierceness knits His unrelenting brows; some clench their hands And almost strike again with moveless brands; Some smile like infants; some their glassy eyes Appealing lift for ever to the skies: Ah, Death, thou hast reservÃ¨d these to be Thy true spectators more than those who see. Put out the torches, ere they fade away In the cold dawning of another day. This the last battle; this, O fate! thy due; Thy victory this, O grave! thy cost, O Waterloo! IV. PEACE. From that red hour sprang forty years of peace, While public wrongs diminish, rights increase: England from loyalty to liberty Grows up the marvel which the nations praise, The country of the men who would be free, Yet lose no thought of ancient days. And thou wast ever with us, thy grey head, O father, known by all, and reverenced; And thy sage voice at council ever heard, O Nestor; not with ended war did cease Thy glory, who didst gain us by thy sword, Then teach us how to use, our peace. The years went by still happier, until Less frequently the old man's face did fill The eyes that loved it, and less frequent grew His step in courts: he died like ripened shock: Not so had died the crushed at Waterloo, Despot and anarch, on his rock. We buried him with such a mourning voice Of our whole state, as made death's regal toys For once no mockery: the people stared And wept upon the pageant as it passed; His withered veterans that last triumph shared, He led them still unto the last. We buried him beside the mighty one Who only watched his glory 'neath the sun, The Duke of armies by the seaman great; His glory is like Albion's; 'tis renewed The same from age to age; its royal seat On love and strength and fortitude. His life like England's storyâroot and fruitâ One growth in many changes; fixed pursuit Of grandest, widest, difficultest things: One in diversityâa track of light, A stream, among the sacred trees that springs, And issues in the infinite. Marlborough: a Historical Ode. âLa patience angÃ©lique de gÃ©nie.â I. Three times, great England, thou in arms hast braved Despots who aimed at universal sway O'er Europe's field; three times thy might hath saved The nations when they prostrate lay; Alone wast thou when countless sails of Spain, Like storm-clouds from the hidden main, Clomb the slow winds to ravage thee; When Toleration, latest child of man, The modern age, whose story then began, Were perilled in thy jeopardy. Alone wast thou when Louis let his hordes Of polished demons o'er the fainting lands; The south and centre shrunk beneath their sword, And held forth supplicating hands: Alone wast thou when first Napoleon flamed Mid Alpine wastes before untamed: When the volcano burst the snow, And streams of fire displaced the glacial rest, Old manners passed, old kings were dispossessed: Alone serene and great wast thou. II. The idea of empire from the CÃ¦sars came; It haunteth still the earth: by might to reign On freedom's neck;âthis was the Roman's claim; This thought inspired Charlemagne. Miraculous tradition! now it serves To grasp the earth with iron nerves, To civilize, to cultivate: Anon, it vaunts not any good to bear, Its aim confessed to spoil, to crush, to tear, Its sinews are but strength and hate. It bands its hireling armies, it invades The homes which freedom labours to increase; Its lying conclaves work in noisome shades, Its bloodhounds bay the flocks of peace. And now the Bourbons, come to royal state, The old tradition fulminate; Begins their tyranny at home From Richelieu and more subtle Mazarin, Then iron arms are stretched the world to win, And Paris is the modern Rome. Louis, third Bourbon, what a work was thine! To burn the world for carnivals of light, To slaughter nations that the town might dine; Augustus of the world polite! Around thee wait thy wondrous valetaille, Europe is governed by Versailles! Luxembourg, Catinat, VendÃ´me, Bind victory on thy banners, Vauban rings With forts thy kingdom, dexterous Louvois wings Thy legions o'er the world to roam. First to transform the vague mobility Of Gallic nature into something fixed; Creator of the France which now we see, Of weakness and of strength commixed, Towards foes an armed Meduse with eyes that burn, While inward poisons slowly turn To snakes her tresses bright: behold E'en now she spreads in world-wide victory, While seeds of revolution secretly Within her fated form unfold. Deal forth thy miracles! Almost in vain Doth William league the nations in thy way, King of noblesse; yet, hark, the winds complain O'er tilth and homestead made a prey; And sees not, while it fawns, thy tinsel train In purblind alley, filthy lane, The night-lamps swinging o'er the breath Of million faces, white and fierce with want? These shall arise from travail grim and gaunt, And drive thy race to cursed death. For hunger gnaws the land; her children swoon, Her grass-fed hinds stand weakly 'neath the trees, While bickering chariot of some mighty one Whirls in white dust along the leas. And tyrannous oppression strikes the right Of man in man with cruel blight: And most unnatural is grown The aspect of the time, and fraught with fear, Hollow submissions, compacts insincere, Domestic wrongs still let alone. Could then thy royal looks so ill discern The rising signs of that dark working sky, That thou to foreign wars thy strength must turn, Regardless of the evils nigh? Oh shame of kings, hadst thou no lands to till, That thou abroad must spoil and kill? Placed in the forehead of that age Which broke from night with energy divine, Could then thy royal looks no more design Than aggrandisive war to wage? Yet thou didst fare in triumph, adding still Province to province, till the century Which closed with death of William, did fulfil Thy haughty mandates utterly; And saw thy flaming sceptre carried far Into receding fields of war; Thy tyrannous exactions wrung From distant realms: thy empire hugely raised; An empire which the coming age displaced, And wide its shivered fragments flung. For thou wast doomed, mature in empiry, To see thy visioned grandeur flit in air: Wouldst thou with Albion's flag divide the sea? La Hogue remands thee to despair: Or wouldst thou taste the sweets of triumph won? The eighteenth age is now begun; And where is thy Turenne? oh, where Luxembourg, for thy need is sore? Behold This age brings forth reversal of things old, And Marlborough rides to rule the war! III. Oh, Marlborough, name traduced by little men, But by the great revered; capacious soul, 'Twas thine o'er warring elements to reign, And chaos into order roll: Thine to maintain our great tradition brought From out the glorious past, and taught To tyranny in blood and fire: England's tradition, that no man shall do Tyrannic deed unchecked; this creed so true Pass ever on to son from sire! Do thou, great England, bid the mists dispart By slander blown, that hide thy son from thee; And clasp thy hero closer to thy heart; Forgive, if aught for pardon be; So he forgave who stood most injured in The hero's hesitating sin; When none discerned where safety lay, And the grim headsman in the unsettled rage Of faction, raving through the lawless age, Awaited him who missed the way. Yes, he forgave who unto death pursued The self-same walk, who banded in the path Of France the nations of the northern blood, And in mid battle poured their wrath: No foot stern William found so firm to tread The devious paths in which he led; No hand to hold the force allied; Who best, they asked him, should supply his need; Who best to counsels and to arms succeed; He pointed them to thee, and died. Rise then our hero, lift thy regal front Above the obscuring dusty cloud; alike Are grains of dust; their multitude is wont A cloud upon the eyes to strike: So hast thou been obscured by atomies Which whirl their sameness in our eyes: 'Tis sad to know that once he fell At mercy of a momentary need; Yet grant his greatness its eternal meed; This is our duty, this is well. IV. He found our England scorned of Europe's kings, He left her arbiter of Europe's fate: An angel's patience and an angel's wings, As swift to fly, as calm to wait: A lion's heart; his eyes of lofty sway, And full of watchful knowledge, play O'er courts and camps; the varied scene, Splendid and agitated, owns the grace Of that wide brow, that most majestic face, Composed and steadfastly serene. In stricter league the powers to join, to assuage Their jealousies by over-mastering tact, This first his office; then, the war to wage Like martial music, act on act. At his command the smouldering war outburns, Gigantic grown, at once returns From old Batavia to the banks Of Danube: lo, that march sublime he heads O'er which old history still exults; he spreads Through realms unknown his steady ranks. The Schelenburg and Blenheim! Greater name We write not on our scroll since Agincourt; Then was the keynote struck of war and fameâ And crushed an army consular: The music of the faultless battle rung Through every nation, every tongue; England had trembled from afar, Her army gulphed in German forest dim: The sound of triumph rose, an empire's hymn; Its splendour rose, a lurid star. The faultless battle rose, and changed and fell Beneath thy master hand from side to side Of that wide field; more subtly changeable Conflict did hero never guide: Who knows not how the sidelong wave doth pour Its bulk upon its space of shore? So poured thy host successively Not over subject sands, but bristling fosse And rampart huge: the rivers wide they cross, And scale in fire the summits high. Why do we muse on battles long ago, Why summon discord from an ancient grave? It is because a people's life doth grow Resurgent from the buried brave: It is because a people's very life Is only known in deadly strife; Because in days of lethargy Its high resolves from this a people drawsâ The grand remembrance of the righteous cause, And of the rightful victory. Therefore shall England ever feel the pride Of those vast triumphs which she shared with thee, Marlborough, when skill supreme her force did guide, When wisdom framed her policy: As often as the wounded victors rose From the slain bodies of their foes, So oft by thee prevailed the right; Thou, only soldier that did never fail, Thou, sounder of the battle's dreadful scale, Thou, darter of the thundrous light. V. For year by year from thy resistless hands Some bolt of battle fell until the foe, From false Bavaria through the Netherlands, Fled in successive overthrow: Until the Gallic soil profanÃ¨d lay By legions marching on their way Toward the spoiler's capital; And Louis in his evil day beheld His vast ambitions on his head repelled, And vengeance on the wicked fall. Count out the tale of battle, Villeroy, Boufflers, VendÃ´me, or Villars; chiefs of fame, Victors o'er all beside; your victor joy Pales in disaster at his name. Sent forth successive to the scene of war, Ye could not check, ye could not bar: Count out the tale:âGuard well thy lines, Oh Villeroy, along the gentle Meuse: Great cities are thy forts; with mighty thews Thy army their defence combines. Behold that army hurled from point to point, Dashed from defences where they had defied Our utmost; like a snake torn joint from joint, And struggling o'er the champaign wide. Re-form them, and the marsh of Ramillies Next year thy heavy columns sees Pressed earthwards in their helpless mass, Crushed by the cannonade, like herd at bay Hounded together, bloodily to pay Their passage from that fell morass. Thou next, VendÃ´me; of many a victor day The wreath hath been thine own; thine utmost now Thy king demands; thine utmost now essay, The chief of all his captains thou. He comes: behold the gathered hosts again Traversing Holland's watered plain, Amid the gentle slopes that guard The bounds of France; again they join the fray; The dust of marching men, the smoke-wreaths sway Above the ring of Oudenarde. There, circling round and round the Gallic host, Our squadrons hemmed them still in narrower room; The combat did but swell when light was lost, Thick-volleyed flashes pierced the gloom: That amphitheatre of death appeared A vast volcano, while careered, But half illumed, the thund'rous pall, And the black shapes of war were instant seen: Fly, VendÃ´me, fly beneath night's friendly screen, The shameful rout is past recall. Shall Lille foreclose the sacred soil of France, High lifted up upon the midnight sky Above the clustered fires that still advance, The trenches opened still more nigh? Nay, Boufflers; though the assault more carnage shows Than the red night of Badajos; Though VendÃ´me strive the garrison To succour, hovering round in dyke and fen, Cold with the coming winter; all in vain; The mighty frontier fort is won. Now, Louis, draw thy latest army round; âSend Villars,â the unconquered; he may show The vengeful fires that spring from holy ground; And Villars moves to meet the foe. Strong his position, mighty his array, Alas, the dawn is Malplaquet! Oh victors, Marlborough and Eugene, Through those wide-shattered ranks may prophet eye The fair unbounded fields of France descry, Yea, Paris is defenceless seen. VI. Nought shall prevent our hero; quick he forms His project vast; high glories are in store, Oh England; Villars' arm nor winter's storms An instant shall delay the war:â What?âdares a common hand to interpose, Ere victor with the vanquished close? To take thy master from thy head, Oh patient England, when the hour was near In which it seemed that all thy toil severe By such a spoil should be repaid? Patience of heaven! the tale is old; 'twas so: Men basely use their greatest even now: Still works the fool the hero's overthrow, The ox and ass together plough: Home, warrior, home; thy glorious toils resign, For thankless enemies combine, As hounds the nobler lion bay: The passions of the factions so are seethed, Utrecht shall sell the meed by arms bequeathed, And tongues thy mighty deeds unsay. Home, warrior, home; uplift thy awful face, Time-worn and battle-furrowed, in the rout; Attest thine innocence in lordly place, With words pathetic silence doubt: Give calumny the lie, bid placemen quail, If virtue may to this prevail; Then sink with decent majesty; Gather thy darkness from their wretched light, Too great with them to wage resentful fight, And in retirement sternly die. What comfort may we find save this, that now, As ever she hath been, was England stayed Upon her adversary's overthrow; Content her generous peace she made; She would not subjugate, she would but strive Unchecked ambition back to drive; Then, like her hero, satisfied, Too proud to exact the utmost and too just To found dominion on ambitious lust, In acquiescence calm who died. Yet thee, the greatest of that age of men, Shall earth forget not; nay, she shall require In after time thy work unfinished, when Outflames once more tyrannic fire: When kingly lust of empire drives the Gaul His neighbour nations to enthral, When famine wastes the fields of spring, When Revolution bursts in myriad force;â In that Red Sea the rider and his horse Are cast, and struggle perishing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sir John Franklin. Sir John Franklin sailed on his last expedition in 1845, with the Erebus and Terror, vessels which the same year had returned with Sir John Ross from the Antarctic expedition. Government continued the search after Franklin till 1854. Then hope was abandoned, and the Admiralty determined to remove from the Navy List the names of the officers of the Erebus and Terror, and to consider them as having died in Her Majesty's service. The only vestiges discovered in the later searches were obtained by Rae, who, in his first overland expedition, reported to the Admiralty in 1852, found floating in Parker Bay two pieces of wood, the one with a clasp or band of iron, and the other with two nails in it, bearing the Government mark. They were unquestionably relics from Franklin's vessels, and were the first proof that a Northwest Passage existed. In his second expedition, Rae obtained from the Esquimaux the fatal news of the catastrophe of Franklin's crews. The last Government expedition of search returned in 1854: the Fox, the private expedition of Lady Franklin, under Captain Mc Clintock, sailed in 1857, and was away three years. Argument. IntroductionâThe First Winter spent by Franklin in the Arctic RegionâThe First SpringâFailure and Cessation of the Government Expeditions of SearchâThe Last Expedition sent by Lady FranklinâThe Franklin RelicsâConclusion. Where the meridians narrow; where the ice Sets its white teeth against the world, a vice Which grips the countless islets of the sea, Northwards we watch; our slackened hands the key Of the last problem of the world enfold. Where the cold northern desert lies unrolled Beneath the signs that never drink the wave, A voice is heard, our brethren from their grave In resurrection, they who sought and found In life, in death; they tell us that unbound The mystery lies, the adamantine chain About the rough fell of the northern main Is broken now; they tell us all their praise By silence; silently before our gaze They rise: they tell us not of death; they died. Why should they speak of death who have untied The knot which England strove to loose of old From those first days when she alone was bold To emulate the glory on your brows, Columbus and Da Gama? earth avows No greater deed; alone did England choose Those uncouth seas; her sons alone had thews Sufficient that toward both east and west, They should attempt the north, whether to wrest Their doubled passage round the Northern Rock, Which bars the eastward voyage, and unlock The sevenfold mouth of Dwina; or to thread From belt to belt the gulfs and channels led About the sunken crest of that half-sphere Which westward greets the Pole: England holds here The old renown, and still the Vikings ride: Willoughby died, and Franklin too hath died; Chancellor won, and Franklin too hath won. Come then, and witness where the ice-fields run To glacier edges upon boundless shores, Where the moraine runs ruinous, where soars The monumental berg, her stony folds The numb and sterile earth with pain upholds Above the sulky margin of the sea, Half buried in primÃ¦val apathy By waters washing round her island-limbs, Half crusted in her frozen scales, while swims The dull air round her, warped and woofed with snows, And frost-smoke streaming from her gnashing floes. Come then, and listen to the solemn voice Which reaches us so newly o'er the poise Of earth and water; listen, ere the rush Of onward time as solemnly shall hush The voice which speaks in its solemnities; Ere memory parts, ere time this deed shall prize As not the latest on his roll of deeds; And much shall be forgotten which now pleads With recent sorrow. By the supreme laws Of being, in the human heart a cause Exists, which seeks for ever the unknown: This still draws close the links mysterious thrown Between the worlds of matter and of thought; Still animates the deep relation, fraught With subtlest truth, of every outward thing To the deep soul within the senses' ring. Now, therefore, they are dearest to our race Who spring with swiftest foot toward the chase Of things unknown; and open to our gaze Another means to grasp the hidden ways Of that infinitude, which circles round Our narrow life; another knowledge found Demands our thanks; now, therefore, we unite In saddened praise of those whose noble might Has filled the Elizabethan chart, unrolled By those who knew God's edicts from of old, The circumnavigation that should be By man accomplished: they laboriously In their outgoings from our silver isle Strove anciently in ships to reconcile The face of nature with the thoughts of God, As man conceives thereof: upon that road Perished in victory the men we mourn, Hailing in death creation's latest bourne. Three lustres have been measured since they passed From mortal view; the hero soul who cast His threescore years behind him, and refused The honours ripely due; and they who cruised With him of old beyond the icy zone: They took from hands heroic as their own The world-famed ships returned from other goal, From wandering round the starless southern pole, The Erebus, the Terror; and they sailed: The whalers saw them to an iceberg haled, Waiting their passage through Lancaster Sound: And since that day no human eye has found Those mariners, but they have passed from men. Fell the first lustre from the summer when They parted, ere at all their track was gained: The startled world had sought them, had unchained Squadrons of rescue, scaled from isle to isle That archipelago of death, awhile In hope, but soon with dire inquietude, For token none appeared, nor sign of good; Until at length some happy news was found Of their first winter upon Arctic ground, And their first summer: this the happier news. They had passed onward, gallant ships and crews, And that great heart which harmonized the whole To its firm purpose, onward, till the roll Of summer seas was stiffened into death: Then had they anchored in the isle beneath North Devon, that shore which stretches stark and rude Three parts toward the highest latitude; Long had they struggled in the ice-choked seas, Steering to gain the northernmost degrees, That they might issue by the channel named Of Wellington; until the autumn aimed His bitter arrows and forbade their path. The vision deepens now amid the wrath Of avalanches, in the very heart Of desolation; round in every part Sweep out illusive channels, and the wind From every quarter bears down scaly rind Of broken floe and pack, which whirls along By tempest launched, with tempest fury strong; And these would rip and rend the thing that dares Oppose them; while about the coast which stares With frozen eyes upon the frozen sea, Are shifted piece by piece incessantly. The breaking floes, which cling with talons sharp To desolate headland, cliff, and scar, and scarp, Above the heaving of the tortured main. We see those barks, like ghosts that wildly wane, Flitting from point to point, essaying still The illusive channels, and with swiftest skill Foiling the icy grasp; an instant more And they were crushed 'twixt icy shore and shore: But as a spirit may survive the strife Of all the base besetments of a life, And keep itself serene, and pure and safe, So they survive, surmounting like the waif Of those wild waves; so they avoid the close Of ice which fain would drift them in its throes Far down the Atlantic: lo, at length they hail The strand of Beechy, furl the shattered sail, And rest; their winter appanage lies here. Therefore, thou desert islet, thou art dear For ever to the comrades of the brave; Upon thy shores they wintered; by the grave Thrice piled on thee thou 'rt dear; the rescuers found After five years the relics on thy ground; On thee the tokens of the sojourn lone They saw; three monuments of simple stone To three who died; the ordered mounds for store, The armoury, the anchor beds, the shore Traversed by sledge-ruts, and the ruined sites Of observation, and the secret bights Where lay the ships; the garden terraces Of lichens, poppies, and anemones. Ah, desolate island of the frozen wave, What dost thou hold? A garden and a grave! Here then they lay; they saw the winter night Deepen upon them, as the sun his flight Into the Scorpion urged; until adown The unshaded darkness sunk with deeper frown, Unbroken, till the moon bedewed the vault With splendid light, Orion made assault On darkness with his flaming sword; arose The false Aurora from her long repose, And vainly spread her wings of phosphor forth To shroud the unpaling loadstar of the north: Her splendours sweep through half the stars, they shine With nebulous lustre, liquid, opaline; Then burst with purpling anger through the gloom, And the far-stretching pallid snows illume With crimson shadows and with bickering flaws; A spectral dance, which grows a heavy cause To simple minds of melancholy dread; As if the Lapland sorceries had led Illusion round the pole; that long eclipse Wrought out weird phantasies; behold where dips With hissing steam of fire into the sea Some lurid star; where some discoloured tree Branches across the zenith, some vast arc All tremulously spans the purple dark; Refraction lifts the hummocks into hills; The fissures gleam like wavy lines of rills From darkling mountains poured; upon the sight The illumined vapours glow with fairy light; The darkness whispers o'er the boundless plain, Vast sighs, as if some monster in his pain Rose on uneasy pillow; burst the seams Of ice with awful crash, and sudden gleams Of dark and rushing water, which o'erfills The fissures, till the strong-ribbed crystal thrills; As if the region terrors strove to shake The soul of man, brave man! The heart may quake, The flesh may shrivel, but the will shall wait Unmoved: God gave man will to conquer fate. Then in the month when shines the Northern Crown, A fickle dawn arises far adown The southern sky, traversing briefest space Of heaven, and vanishing without a trace; So over chaos when God first made light Without a sun, the vision flitted bright, Then died away, and the first day was done. But morn by morn the promise of the sun Grows clear; the south is filled with crimson flocks In place of that grim darkness and its shocks: Behind the cloud-bars undulates and flows A subtle radiance; this too clears and grows To white intensity, and then the shroud Bursts from the sun-god, and the clammy crowd Of vapours rustles into golden foam Before his prow; heaven is again his home. Ah, then they issued from their cabined sleep, They watched the thaw pervading through the deep Beneath a light that sets not: wildly pour The glacial torrents from the hills that bore The avalanche; the glistening ice-fields crawl Like snakes along the tideways; grandly fall The loosened bergs to welter on their way; And brightly dance the blue free waves, and play The thawing monsters; heaves its hoary flakes The Arctic whale, the solemn walrus makes Unwieldy mirth, the seal with human eyes Flaps o'er the fragments; burst a thousand cries From the wild sea-birds sailing northward all, The ptarmigan, the eider duck; they call The little dovekie from his winter watch Upon the ice to secret haunts, where snatch Once more their struggling life those mountain flowers Which bloom on Arctic wastes or Alpine towers Alike: sweet crowfoot, hardy saxafrage, And acid sorrel; these o'ergrow the age Of hoary headland, and of desolate lea; Yea, willow and sweet purple bleaberry, Dwarfed into miniature by ceaseless frost, These clothe the splintered ledges; they have lost Their uprightness, along the rocks they trail, Fearing the icy wind; and thin and pale Live on for love of all the life that is: The wavy hair-grass weaves its phantasies In little circles o'er the reindeer moss. So scanty is the spring to those who cross The northern desert; yet that winter lone And scanty spring were brightest days that shone For those who died: two direful winters more They passed, unblessed by any sheltering shore, Nipped in the ice: strained forth in vain the sail, The steam-drift did but freeze upon the gale: The cruel pack still gripped them, still delayed Nineteen long months, and scarce one mile they made For every month: then came the bitter end. And nought was heard, though England still did send Through summers six her succours; efforts vain Columbia added; yet the northern main Hid its dread secret, nought of comfort more; Though tenderly the seekers did explore Coast-line and stream, as brothers tenderly For brothers dead: England, upon the sea Thy name is greatest, and 'tis nowhere writ More grandly than upon the isles which split The frozen ocean into thousand streams; For every headland, every channel gleams With names for ever precious in our story, E'en from of old, from that first break of glory Which makes our little island shine a star Set in the nether heaven: they sought afar, Yet what was left those seekers now to find? Death, only death was left by time behind, Or victory, or death in victory. And this was ravished from the ghostly sea, And this one seeker out of many found: For first in Parker Bay, that western sound Which joins the clear Pacific, he descried Those iron-banded timbers which the tide Was drifting; those torn shreds of oak and pine Proclaim the guerdon won, the glory thine, Franklin; for they in western straits were laid; Wherefore the North-west Passage thou hadst made, And thine the prize for which our chivalry Still rode the northern tempests; yea, the sea Eastward and westward joins a slender hand O'er the new world; and shattered pole and band Are hero's lance left shivered in the lists. Another thing that seeker in the mists Of fate had found; the wandering Esquimaux A spectral band had met long years ago, As lives are counted;âpallid faces set Toward the south, gaunt bodies toiling yet For life; they saw them dragging still the sledge, Heavy as death, along the rugged edge Of that vast ice-stream which, with monstrous tread, An avalanche that fills an ocean's bed, Crashes its way by shattered floe and floe, Not swifter than descends the hardened snow From Alps through ages; lo, they take their way Toward the Great Fish River, where, they say, God may send deer to shoot; and all the waste Shall end, and all the toil and panic haste. Again those wanderers spake, a tale of dread: They saw them scattered, famished, frozen, dead, Upon the snow; their bones were bleaching there, The snow their shroud, the ice their sepulchre: Oh victory, and death in victory! No more did England struggle hopelessly The dead to gather, since the tale was told; Enough had perished in the hungry cold. No more, she cried, my sons shall trust those waves, Enough have died; their peace be on their graves; Beneath an ever-rising tomb they lie, Their deathless star regards them from the sky; Enough have died; the living to console Be ours; the dead we seek not: from the roll Of living men their names were blotted out; Yes, further venture had been less devout. Now, hither, Hope, embracing thy despair; Now hither, Faith, who through the unseen air Dost track thy dead as living: give me light From your deep presence; let me tell aright The deed of her whom all men celebrate; Who took the tokens of her husband's fate With heart unblenching; who, though England stayed, Stayed not her hands from seeking, but obeyed The passionate instinct that was sure to find, Though seeking life no more: ah, too unkind Had been the years, nor hope of life remained: She sought to vindicate the fame attained By such a death, and fully to proclaim, If it might be, his triumph and the name Of his achievement. Welcome, was her cry, That greater word, that life of those who die, Fame, fame! Well knew she that he was the first This wondrous century who had traversed Those hidden chambers: that he lived as one From whose firm eyes a vision has not gone, And kept his gaze beyond the hopes and fears Of common life, and counted out his years By coasts explored and latitudes attained, The new Ulysses: death at length had deigned, She knew, to lay the crown on such a brow: 'Twas his to make, 'twas hers to prove, his vow. Ah, lady, worthy thou of her who gave Her banner to her hero, not to wave O'er her last bed but o'er his triumph; then In her first beauty died: thy voice and pen Stirred England, knit the iron nerve which strove To gather its own dead; and now for love Of him and thee, behold, in three years' space From that first pause of search, another chase Flits o'er the waters, skirts the grinding pack, And spends as many years upon the track As spent the dead: well freighted for thy part, Oh little bark, with many a lion heart; For all had given their lives, and some had given Large grants to speed thy way; well had she striven For this who sent thee forth, within thy hold Storing her faith sublime, her prayers untold. Long time they tarried on their darksome way, What bring they now? They have returned to-day. They saw the northern miracles; they cleft Heart-deep the mystery; their triumph left Its record on the desert of the scene. They passed to where the dead alive had been; Probation held they nigh as long and stern As slew the dead; therefore they bid us learn From their own tale how suffered they who died. They saw the sky turn o'er them, multiplied In false horizons, japing moons and suns, And irised zones, so fair and false at once, So mocked the very heavens on those who died. They saw mirage of cold, not heat: how wide The rainbow-tinted pediments uphold Ellora, Memphis, or Telmessus old; So laughed the ready tomb on those who died. They paled in monstrous night; and they did hide The pallor of their faces from the sun: His beams would blind them, glaring forth anon: So did they pale, and so did shrink, who died. They split the floes, they took the pack, defied The toppling icebergs; sheathed in icy drift, Themselves an iceberg, they did veer and shift With pain in bitter change of frost and thaw; Their patient strength the heavy sledge did draw League after league and month by month around The iron islet and the frozen sound: So sailed, so ranged, so laboured they who died. They shook with famine as they did divide After the weary march their scanty store: They shook with cold upon the icy floor, Where scantly they were hutted from the blast: Enough; behold how ere the final fast, How ere th' eternal sleep, they shook who died. For all was true; they could but pause beside Those cairns, those sepulchres, which told the tale That rumour told before; they could but quail At sight of that grim ice-stream which had gripped, Those grisly floes, which at the last had nipped To death the ships; they could but trace the path Where the lost feet had stumbled o'er the swath Of the ribbed ice; they could but weep at thought Of southern snow-cloud, which had gently caught The weary ones, and wound them in its pall: But tears and sweat are frozen ere they fall With those who seek the dead who died so well. The bleaching skeleton of one who fell Beneath Cape Herschel, fallen on his face, Lies stretched to witness that it was the grace Of those dead mariners to win the way, To snatch the secret from the dragon play Of all the north; a worthy witness he Of such an enterprise as needs must be By death fulfilled: they saw him where he lay In his mute witness through that monstrous day Whose hours are months; and through that lengthened night Whose fires avail the sky alone to light, Not show the earth: he lay as he had died. And so they bring their relics from the side Of the gaunt glacier home; we hold them here: Each shattered fragment England clasps; revere In these the relics of the dead; behold In these the trophies of the brave, as old And worn they lie amid memorials proud, With veneration be their worth allowed. Behold them; there are things of daily need, Exempt from use how long! No man shall read Their pathos decent and magnanimous With unmoved eye; and things that bear for us A loftier importâtake of all the sum; The books of piety so worn by numb, Dead hands that prayed; and that discoloured rag Those hands upbore through all: 'twas England's flag. And shall their fame be lost? The butterfly Flitting beneath that Hyperborean sky, Chilled by the glacial blast, shall sink and spread Its stiffened wings upon the snow; a bed Shall soon be scooped; life's dying warmth suffice To dig the grave for death: anon shall rise A little mound, that shall as truly lie To north as any magnet, for the fly So swayed in death his wings; the traveller By that small grave his lonely course may steer. Things perish not in death; a presence grows From human deeds, which, as the wondrous rose Of morning turns the wan and wasteful grey In heaven to glorious warmth, and brings the day To darksome places; as the boreal light Flushes the chilly fields of shadeless white; Doth so transform the realm of the unknown, That northern waste of spirit, till 'tis grown Full of sweet human presence, peopled widely With memory, thought, and hope; no longer idly Dissevered from true use: and since to all That man attains, some failure still must fall, Nor aught be perfect, happy let us hail You, noble spirits, who did only fail In death alone: hail, happy on your bier Of snow: the spirit rises, falls the tear. Havelock's March. They were but a thousand strong; they marched Through a hundred thousand mutinous foes; O'er a hundred leagues of desert parched, Where sunstroke falls, and the Simoon blows: They were but a thousand strong. They were but a thousand; fate denied That more should meet our utter need; And as they died, the few supplied Did never make the force exceed In number a thousand strong. Many a mile they onward passed Through swampy grass and field of dall, By mangoe grove, through jungle vast, And the squalid huts of the villages small: They were but a thousand strong. And every day they fought the foe, And beat him backward many a mile; Till their name grew bright and terrible, so That the brave world everywhere did smile With joy at the thousand strong. And so at last they reached Cawnpore, Where the bloody Nana was lying then; Who stood to try one battle more For the possession of his den Against but a thousand strong. And many a gun he laid in train To sweep along our serried ranks; His foot entrenched lay on the plain, His horsemen clustered on his flanks Against but a thousand strong. Through reeling heat-mists of the noon The tottering force to battle pants, And sees through the threaded forest soon The spectral camels and elephants, Where they wait our thousand strong. They move in life as we draw nigh, The gorgeous eastern plumage shakes, The tulwahs flash, the banners fly, At once the imaged battle wakes Against but a thousand strong. The sowars charged in boiling waves, Their faces black neath turbans white; The sepoys plied their guns like slaves Beneath their bloody tyrant's sight, Who dreaded a thousand strong. Their rapid volleys fell like hail; In copse and tope they make their stand; In vain, in vain;âthey nought avail When England meets them brand to brand, And charges, a thousand strong. On rolled the cloud of the Fusiliers, The bayonet points gleamed sharp behind, Like the thunder cloud and the lightning spears, O'er the deadly open they sped like wind With the rush of a thousand strong. The gunner fled from his reeking gun, The horseman turned his bridle rein; The cowards feared their coming on, They shuddered at the pibroch strain, And the cheer of a thousand strong. The day was won; but woe the sight That turned the victor's eye to gloom; The station in its bloody plight, The witness of a bloody doom. Oh, the sobs of a thousand strong! They came to seek the living there; They found the dead all freshly slain, The shambles foul with blood and hair, The well which choking corpses stain: Too late were the thousand strong. Then wept the iron men who ne'er Had shrunk from peril of the foe; While through the night with saddened eare The burial trains with torches go In sight of the thousand strong. The dead they buried out of sight, A vengeful oath they deeply swore; They manned their ranks, and sternly bright Wound from the station of Cawnpore On the march of a thousand strong. Into the country deep they plunge, O'er the wide river into Oude, O'er the thrice-fought field of Busserutgunge They thrice their desperate path renewed On the march of a thousand strong. At length above the level waste They saw fair Lucknow's towers arise; Where still was England's lion raised, Though forty thousand enemies Awaited a thousand strong. They broke their way through the Alumbagh, And nought withstood their fierce assault; The Charbagh trembled with the war; From street to street the banners vault In the rush of a thousand strong. Havelock leads them, Outram leads, True knight and noble general; Their arm restrains, their bright steel speeds, Their voice is as the trumpet's call At the head of a thousand strong. The goal they sought was far aloof, Deep pitfalls seamed their narrow road, Thick poured the shot from wall and roof, The sun's dread arrows went abroad: On, on rushed the thousand strong. Then Neil, the lion-hearted, fell; No greater name, nor more revered; But Maude his battering guns plied well, And still the levelled bayonets cleared The path of the thousand strong. 'Tis o'er: the straitened garrison From darksome countermine hath sprung, From rending bastion, reeking gun; While sobs, the rescued ones among, Each man of the thousand strong. Ah, who shall tell the meeting when The glorious deed was all achieved: English women, babes, and men, From death and more than death reprieved,â These greeted the thousand strong. Havelock, noble dying chief, Thy triumph and thy grave were here: Thy triumph swift, thy days were brief; Cold sunk the hero on his bier, The chief of a thousand strong. Refused his feeble frame to blench, While toil or peril was to do; The work achieved the flame did quench; No more sufficed the brave, the true, The chief of a thousand strong. They buried him where evermore His glory might behold his grave; Who won the crown, the cross who bore; The oriental trees o'erwave The chief of a thousand strong. Havelock, nobler name than thine Not anywhere does England own: Patience and virtue both entwine Thy lowly grave so far and lone, Great chief of a thousand strong. We rear the monumental shrine, A nation's heart such homage craved; But nobler monuments are thine, The shattered foe, the city saved, The tears of a thousand strong. Havelock, nobler name than thine Doth storied England nowhere own; Patience and virtue intertwine Around thy grave so far and lone, Chief, chief of a thousand strong. Legion. He had come back from Christ: His neighbours watched him sitting there Quiet and clothed; but if perchance Upon him fell a doubtful glance, He rose and sat away, or shook With troubled look. Beside the door he sat; The household tasks within were plied; The Galilean sea and shore In the deep distance purpled o'er, Before him rose in prospect wide At eventide. The tombs in terraces Rock-hewn beyond the lake arose; The creeping waters came more near, A light mist wrapped the surface clear Wherein the swine were choked, with those His demon foes. Beyond the water's edge Gleamed one white lintel of a tomb; Beneath it yawned a deadly gap Of shade that did the entrance wrap; Upon no eye save his might loom That gleam and gloom. 'Twas there that he had been When he could take no note of time, But felt the pressure pant on pant Of all earth's bars of adamant About him, nor could leap and climb, But lay in slime. The while they kept him cold, Senseless and dumb and deaf and blind; Nor tasted he, nor heard, nor smelt, Nor light nor warmth of nature felt; For all the fiends had so combined Against his mind. 'Twas there that first he found In pain the sense of life, a spark Of manhood, a resisting spot, A thought which could aver that not For ever should his world be dark: And he did mark The wicked work of fiends; And maniacally struggled then; And in that little light of dawn He grew to loathe the hellish spawn, And ghastly from his lonesome den Leaped forth on men A madman by a tomb, A snake among the rocks he was To wriggle down the fissures there, And nakedly to strut and stare, And spring on whosoe'er should pass, Though bound with brass. 'Twas there that he had seen A second self beside him clash The brazen fetters on him bound, And laugh and shriek and leap around, And sharp stones in his own flesh dash, Pitiless, rash. Upon that countenance He saw malicious fiends enact Their furies, twist a human form As it had been a tortured worm; Yell blasphemies through organs racked In the foul fact. 'Twas there that he had met His Healer coming from the ship After the tempest on the lake: Though no man there his way might take, The Twelve were there: he thought to leap Like wolf on sheep. All fear surprised him then; For madness turned to terror there; Peered horribly his head erect A moment, and the step he checked Still held his limbs, and in the air His strong hands bare. Held out his shattered chains: A mighty spasm his body tore; His eyes shot out a bursting glare; His voice died out, and wide his hair Flamed upward, ere the damp could soar From each wide pore. For what had happened then? What pang convulsed each furious limb? Christ spake; and with His voice did pierce That maddened heart exceeding fierce; And at the word came forth from him The Satanim. St. Thomas in India. I stand alone; the votive crowd is gone From the wide streets, the courts, the temple door; And I pursue in thought with wonder flown Through the closed fane, along the darkened floor, The horror folded in By those vast valves, the thing of sin, The Pagod sitting dark within, To whom the myriads bow; my demon foe; To whom each man that might the passage win Through those fell portals, dancing forth did show To the wild crowd without, a face Of leaden hue, a rapturous gaze In his set eyeballs that did blaze. And shrieked for fire, or thorny leaves did chew; Or gnawed a writhing serpent by the tail; Or upon pointed swords his body threw, While his black limbs shone with impervious mail Of rigid muscle; then the fit Left him, and weak and wild of wit The shaking creature there did sit. So great the power that doth the demon arm; And I in vain each day encounter it: Each day I see again the myriad swarm Of worshippers all passionate, Blindly, marvellously elate, Self-cruel, leaping to their fate. From provinces and realms afar they come, Not seeking life but death; ah, Thou didst stay The crowds about thy Galilean home With other comfort in thy holy day, My Master, when thy hand The sick man raised and bade him stand, And demons fled at thy command. They come, they flow unto this temple vast, Led on by sorceries, a frantic band, In brutal transformation, mad, aghast, Through dust and heat and thirst they pant, They jape, they dance, they shriek, they rant, Each man a braying hierophant. The wrinkled fane receives them with a grin Of serpent cunning, so it seems to me; One after one entranced they pass within Its jaws enormous of dark sorcery: And still it waits them, lurking still In the deep caverns of the hill In which 'tis hewn by demon skill; Like countless lizard feet its pillars small Seem almost creeping with an evil will, Each of them is a mountain's pedestal; For it has made the mount its lair, And through the living rock doth wear Its path malign by vault and stair. And all the fissured faces of the rocks Are rough with sculptures wildly intricate Of hideous gods, wherein are lodged the flocks Of sacred birds and apes; and round the gate Burn the cane cressets, hang the swings, The flesh-hooks and the bloody strings In which the tortured body swings, What time the fury reacheth to its height, And the low throbbing drum incessant sings, And madding dins the maniac throng excite To awful rites of blood and lust, Till in the heat the very dust Is laid with murderous holocaust. Ah, how shall it be ended? Wonder grows To mark the working of the demon's might: But greater wonder at the sign which shows This darkness to be swallowed up of light. Master, I comprehend Through the deep comfort thou dost send, The great beginnings of the end: For this am I thy feeble instrument; What boots it now to reason? Thou dost rend The heavens in working out thine own intent: Thy beams shall quench the savage flame, Thy love the savage might shall tame, This people shall confess thy name. Yea, I who doubted once may doubt no more, Albeit I stand alone believing Thee Of all the millions of this mighty shore; What I have heard and seen sufficeth me. I saw thy sacred head among The swaying waves of Salem's throng, When Thou didst pass to death along The steep ascending street: alone wast Thou; Alone am I; yet 'tis my joyful song That thou, oh Lord, art with thy servant now: I cast my life in jeopardy, I welcome death as victory, I shall declare thy truth and die. Joseph of Arimathea And Nicodemus. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this poem. The abbreviations used are as follows: For Jos. read Joseph of Arimathea For Nic. read Nicodemus Jos. I took His Body from the tree, Wrapped it in linen decently, And many times I bent my knee Before I buried him. Nic. I took of aloes and of myrrh, That I might aid thee to inter That Holy Thing in sepulchre; We were two Nethenim. Jos. I had a sepulchre of stone, Wherein afore was buried none: In this I laid Him all alone; The stone did many seal. Nic. I stood afar when in my sight The crosses rose upon the height, And fretted with their forms the light Above the dreadful hill. Jos. I am a noble counsellor, God's kingdom have I waited for, But was not of the counsel, nor After the deed of them. Nic. A ruler of the Jews am I; And His disciple secretly; I pleaded that He should not die Before the Sanhedrim. Jos. Riches have I in Arimathy, For it is said in prophecy That He among the rich should die: That prophet I fulfil. Nic. Three years afore I came by night To visit Him, who did invite The weary to a burden light, And all the sick did heal. Jos. I was within the temple when He scourged away the throng of men: It was at the beginning then Of all His ministry. Nic. I learned His doctrine in my mind, His kingdom, that should be confined To those of water and of wind New-born by mystery. Jos. And I remember and can tell, When He the temple purged so well, How many said that Israel Did now their king possess. Nic. That king should be, He said to me, Raised not on throne but on the tree, As Moses made the serpent be Raised in the wilderness. Mercy. Earth, sad earth, thou roamest Through the day and night; Weary with the darkness, Weary with the light. Clouds of hanging judgment, And the cloud that weeps for me, Swell above the mountain, Strive above the sea. But, sad earth, thou knowest All my love for thee; Therefore thou dost welcome The cloud that weeps for me. Inscience. The wind, like mist of purple grain, Arises o'er the Arab plain; Strange constellations flashing soar Above the dreadful Boreal shore. But never purple cloud I see Swelling above immensity; And never galaxy doth peer Through the thick mists that wrap me here: Hard is the way, shut is the gate, And life is in a narrow strait. Once only did my soul aspire To scale the Orient dropping fire; Once only floated in the ways Of heaven apart from earthly haze: And then it was a foolish soul, And knew not how the heavens do roll. The Spirit of the Sphere. By the sun's irradiate car, By the yellow-faced moon; By the magic of each star, We may find thee very soon. Thou art light and thou art free, And to live rejoiceth thee Where the splendours greatest be. By the flaming zodiac, By the cloud that looms with fire, By the fierce equator's track, Thou art found to our desire. Thou a seraph art to go All undaunted to and fro Where the fiercest ardours glow. By the butterflies that fold Little weary wings in sleep, Ere the moon is made of gold, We perceive thy presence deep. Thou an angel art, and well It sufficeth thee to dwell In the smallest creature's cell. By the burnished beech that spreads Shining leaves in summer's hour, By the thistle's dancing heads, We may see thy lovely power. Thou a spirit art most sweet, And to make all life complete Everywhere thou hast thy seat. By the Sea. In tottering row, like shadows, silently The old pier-timbers struggle from the sea; Strained in old storms by those wild waves that creep So gently now, no longer do they keep The pier that on them rested long ago, But stand as driven piles in tottering row. The sky sails downward, upward creeps the wave, For countless clouds toward the sun's bright grave Move curiously with grey and misty wing; So thickly all the sky environing, That only by one pale bright spot is known Where still the sunken light is upward thrown, And lately sunk the weary king of day: Still on the sands below in stealthy play Arise the billows of the nightly tide; Each with its own clear layer doth override The spreaded calm where its last brother rolled; Each upon other rippling draws the fold Of its thin edge along the soakÃ«d sand, And stirs the spongy foam 'twixt sea and land, And lifts the dark waifs higher on the shore. Yet in this quietness resides the roar Of ocean floods; one rising of that wind, And those slow clouds would leave the night behind In bitter clearness; those cold waves would roll In snarling billows white. So of the soul. Sunset. A tract of light divides on either hand The darkness of the clouds and of the land, Low-stretched across the sky, like yellow sand; Like yellow sand upon the billowy shore; Of all the sunset there remains no more, The sand is threatened by the breaker's roar. The Birth of Apollo. The east began to brighten; sweetly grave, Its grey diffusion rippled like a wave The dark expectant clouds above the hill, And severed light from darkness: rising still, A secret influence moved upon the dark, A lucid chasm the interval did mark Between the hill-top fringÃ«d with its trees And the dark vast above: the bitter breeze Wrung some sad tears from those soft clouds that hung Above that chasm, for there they would have clung, But could not live within the spreading ray, Which preyed upon them as they moved away. All else was darkness down the steep hill-side, All through the valley to the shore beside Writhing Latona's hermitage of grief: Scarce one wild gleam could give the sea relief, Or make the harsh foam whiten on the shore: But in a little while, as more and more The dawning grew, her weary eye could see How in the night the grey clouds stonily Had built the vault of heaven; the shaggy slope Was rolled in forest; and the rays did grope, Passing o'er midway trees with sleepy heads And crowning them with fire, amid the beds Of the wide valley, where cold Night was laid Deep-drenched with weeping mists that still obeyed Her fainter wand; but soon all spectral pale They tossed convulsed, and more and more did fail, And 'gan to vanish wreathedly away With hectic hues, wild shapes, and rolling play, In one dim scene with radiance involved; And now the splendour all the air dissolved, The morning overspread the moaning sea. It was a dawn as sacred as might be Before some change in nature's ministers, While shuddered on their seats the ancient peers Of day and night; a dawn to hail the birth Of some new wonder in the heavens and earth; A solemn gathering of older things Ere transformation; waving of wide wings Of eyas gods; expectance, doubt, suspense, Eager surprise, the thrilling of the sense Of nature's multitudes of all the powers That rule her awful courts through all her hours. And lo, where mighty Neptune rises, he Of dark-green locks, seen on the foamy sea, Holding his trident and the iron reins That curb his wallowing steeds through ocean's plains, 'Tis he who roams the isles; he, who did root The floating island for Latona's foot: Now he is gone: and lo, where Iris now Binds her light fillet upon Typhon's brow, And vanishes; see Niobe's dear tears Drop like the rain, and like the gleam appears Aglaia's smile: all these and many more Move, like a crowd around an open door, Coming and going with an eager gaze About the wonder which its course delays: It shall delay no more; the accomplishment Shall give them all to rapture and content; And in the clouds all-hidden Artemis Her brother of the golden bow shall kiss. There lay Latona 'neath the bending tree, The Eremite of patience, constantly The watcher of the daybreak, who had seen Nine morns of travail, lying so between The reckless sea and shaggy mountain shore: As many months its load her body bore, So many days she felt the pang severe; So that her father in the nether sphere Of Tartarus, 'neath the all-receiving host, Hades, had rent with yells the brazen coast, Labouring with rage to know her torment; he CÅus the Titan; thus convulsively The central deep was troubled at the birth. But gentle forms there were upon the earth, Watching the mother; these her sisters mighty, Dione, Rhea, Themis, Amphitrite, Who stood around with comforts; yet they four A look of melancholy foresight wore, For they were come from Titan husbands pent Beneath the light in endless 'prisonment, And who had uttered groaning prophecies, That now a new usurper should arise To keep their old dominion in suspense, And more confine their pallid influence; Another, from that fated kindred come, Which gave its life by pitifullest doom To its displacers: much remorseful blame Had those grave goddesses before they came, Because they ever did descend to love The cruel brotherhood of younger Jove. And yet not willingly, not willingly Had they for love foregone their sovereignty, Not willingly betrayed the older race; But so was it to be; the old gave place, Though great and beautiful they were, to new, Greater, more beautiful; it must ensue In the world's progress; and the old must yield And settle them in peace, though many a field Of Titan battle be remembered still, And many a groan at present wrong and ill Shall echo through the caverns of the spheres, Calling the vacant peace of olden years. Ah, woe is me, Dione thought, that e'er The wanton Cytherea I did bear: Ah, woe is me, thought Themis, that I bore The sharp and pinching Fates, and many more That prey upon the empire old and large: Ah me, thought Rhea, for I am the marge From whom the new destruction did begin; I was the nurse of all that cruel kin, I rescued them, and for my recompense They hurled old Saturn from his eminence. And Amphitrite thought of Neptune's scorn When first from her rough Triton was new-born, And drove his mother from the sunny waves To harbour with old Nereus in his caves. And now, Latona, that new dynasty Through thy long travail shall completed be; Full grandeur shall Olympus soon have won Joined by the golden aspect of thy son: All-lone Latona, safe art thou beneath The Delian palm-tree from the poisonous breath Of dragon Python by fierce Juno sent To drive thee through the homeless continent: And Iris hath the gentle soother brought, Who waits on birth, whom, full of evil thought, The cruel Juno kept so long away. Now shall the hour of birth no more delay, The birth of him who from his very birth Was the uniter of the heavens and earth. The birth-hour came, and her the birth-pang took; And soon the goddess with a mortal look Beheld her son; and soon the goddesses With shrilly cries pressed round her nursing knees, Beholding him; yet wonder changed to awe E'en in those heaven-born, whereas they saw The wondrous light about each baby limb. Anon in vestures delicate and trim They wrap him; but, behold, the swaddling bands Held not his swelling heart, with mighty hands He rends them off, and rising to his feet Stands forth full-grown in deity complete. His dreadful arrows rattled at his side, His lyre was in his hands; with royal stride He left them, passing to the continent, Or soaring skyward with divine ascent, And joined Olympus; from his very birth The great uniter of the heaven and earth. For he shall be the golden king of day, And he o'er Lycia and MÅonia And all the isles shall rule; and wander far With golden hymns among the tribes that are Most wretched without poetry and song. And many a cavern shall he hold among The widely severed nations, where shall spring, Like founts of gloom, the shadows following The shapes of shafts and columned walls that spread Into the gathered roof high overhead: Where Jove's decrees from out the fragrant fires The vehement prophet, whom the god inspires, Shall utter; but none else shall enter there, None with wrapped mouth and stealthy footstep dare To pry within, lest madness him consume, And he die shrieking in the hollow gloom, Intoxicate with pain; for deity So quickly vengeful shall none other be. And he shall sing of beauty wondrously, That all fair things may learn how fair they be: And very truth in his deep eye shall pierce, For he shall know the boundless universe. And he shall bend his golden arrows keen Against offence; for by the gods is seen, And grasped with mighty spiritual hands, And slain, that evil thing which ever stands Abstract, impalpable to mortal sense, Known by its bitterness, and named offence, Ill, pain, woe, blame, grief, hate, doubt, dread, death, shame: Ah, we have named it by such other name, But naming heals not: 'tis a phantom dart, A ghostly hand that grasps the very heart, An ice-wind that congeals the very life: And we avail not in unequal strife; But the immortal gods with hands of might Dash the fell phantom from their halls of light; And they through him shall aid with gentleness The wretched race that ever toils to dress The hollow earth which swallows them at last: They shall come down upon the broad sea-blast, Or in the mantling mist, with pity sweet: Because of him the gods with men shall meet, And Jove through him to earth shall kinder be. Thus joyed the earth in that nativity, Thus heaven received him, from his hour of birth The great uniter of the heaven and earth. Orpheus. The osprey of the shore resigned her reign Before the raven of the stricken plain, And she before the vulture of the hills: So far had Orpheus travelled: now the rills More frequent glittered on the guttered clift, And he arrived the vast TÃ¦narian rift: Across his path the rapid serpent shot, The bristling wolf with mouth all panting hot; And now he stood upon the ruined base Of Neptune's temple; 'twas an awful place, Built long ago by men Cyclopian, Now mouldered into ruin, wasted, wan, Open to heaven, and beat by every storm. There on the fragments lay the stony form Of the great monarch of green waves, beside A cavern deep, whose mouth his bulk did hide. Far stretched the desolate landscape from the height; The nearer valleys hidden were from sight By many a ridge with dwarfish copses clad; And from each hollow rising white and sad The mist crept up from where the ridges fell In parallels of ruin toward the dell: The river with its cold and wandering stream All suddenly to sink in earth did seem, Although afar its mazes serpentine Wound languidly and with pale gleam did shine, Where through the infirm plain it felt its way: And on the utmost bound of sight there lay What seemed the spectre of a city white; But ah, as even then the wanderer's sight Took comfort in the thought that men were there, The cloudy cheat is scattered into air; And in a moment, lightning-fraught, it sails Tumultuous on the currents of the gales. Whence had he come, that wanderer; seeking what, That lightning answered him? Who knows not that? Who knows not how among the dead he sought Eurydice the dead?âWith fiery thought, In answer to that burst of cloudy fire, He grasps the chords of his compelling lyre, Draws in his hand, and flings upon the air The first of that wild burden of despair Where sorrow, anguish, pain, regret, became An incantation of fine force to tame Brute nature, crossing Jove, relentless Fate, Life to transmute, death to reanimate. Earth hath no more that magic; sorrow's art Man long hath lost, though keeping sorrow's heart. And, as arose that Orphic strain, began A wondrous dew to fall around the man, Seeming an element for harmony, Which the sweet music summoned from the sky; Such elemental dew as might contain The four primÃ¦vals in its purple grain; Soft, aqueous-bodied, with ignescent gleams, Toward earth it flutters and through air it teems: And as it thickened, the descending flush Invested all the earth; its ceaseless rush Hummed resolutely, till uprose a sense That nought could be impossible from hence Which music or the soul of love would see; That wonders from henceforth had power to be, Nought inconsistent, nought repulsive, nought Impossible, which man in music sought. Ah, so it still might be, could sorrow's soul Commingle with the universal whole: For then that sorrow, that large human dower, Which is the best we keep, were made a power To win us back our heaven: but sorrow's art Man hath lost long; he keeps but sorrow's heart. The music prospered, growing stern and strange With thoughts of great successions, thoughts of change, Thoughts about moonlit hills where shadows stretch, About wild fires that chase the panting wretch; About grim splintered forests on old mounts; About the sea; about the eternal founts Of light and darkness; Hyperborean tracts; RiphÅan summits; Pontic cataracts; Concussions strange from inward labours brought Of mother earth, or ocean overwrought, Or bursting winds; when seas have yielded place To earth, and islands sunk without a trace: Creation moved in answer to the vast Emotions of the mind on which 'tis massed. This was the lore of sorrow; sorrow's art Man knows no more, though sorrow break his heart. Anon the inspired thought did deeper draw Upon the sources of eternal law; And that was bruited on the thrilling strings Which lies beneath the universe of things, The unity which is the base of all, Causing diversity with mystical Resemblance, which is truth: in each there is Conscience or self; the same in all is this; This is eternal, this for aye inheres In trodden clods as in the rolling spheres, In beasts, in men, in gods; this makes all one, Partakers of an awful unison, Which from an ever-brimming fount of life Procureth peace in spite of hate and strife, And harmonizes, since all need must sway With the essential motion, need must stay With the eternal rest: nor bitter fate Can shatter, frustrate, force, nor alienate. That argument of sorrow and that art No more hath man; he hath but sorrow's heart. But now a mighty moving was begun About that desert, neath the shadowed sun; And presently in a fantastic rout The creatures all enchanted came about; The rabbit left his burrow; from his mound The blind mole rolled, and cried upon the ground; Large herds of deer tossed their convicted heads; Wild horses circled round; the brakes, the beds Of silent underwood rustled and spake In various signs; the sloth was wide awake; The very serpent left the covert's root, Advancing his horned head toward the lute; Her flank the stealthy wild-cat dared confide Uncovered, by the open forest's side. But what is this, when with prepared hand The minstrel smites, as with a tenfold wand, More mastery, more magic, art than art More mighty, that hath turned e'en sorrow's heart To use of life against usurping ill? What is it that the very heavens doth fill With sound that doth entrance them like the light Of speeding suns, whose rippling lustre-flight Confounds the clouds in glory? Is it now The tumult of the secret's bubbling flow Which underlies the awful heart of things, Solving itself to those melodious strings? What is it that so bows the mountain down, And the great forest rocks from root to crown, Which bids unthunderous lightnings come and go, Like breath from the cloud-lips which hover so? For now he sings of love; could he proceed, And name not love, the inmost spirit's creed, Who knew the heart of sorrow and the art? Therefore behold how heaven and earth dispart In momentary rhythm, when soul and sense With blind extreme of ecstasy intense Blended and interfused, avow things new Each for the other, each in form and hue: And all the moving air, with giddiness Transported into light, doth now impress A wondrous transformation on the earth: Vast-shaped shadows issue into birth At the still speeding of the silent winds, And overhang with pomp the many kinds Of fretted forest, mountain, plain, below; Far off the land from heaven's rich overflow Imbibes aÃ«rial tints; far off the light Strikes into splendour distant glen or height; But he, who lifts his keen face neath the vast And heavy curtains of the sky o'ercast, While from the chords his daring hand he stays, Expects the consummation of amaze, The sorrowing marvel of the solved skies. A cold wind passes; and fierce shocks surprise Those slow sublimities; a radiant flood Of light supernal bursts o'er hill and wood, And smites the eyeballs of that lifted face. Now might he gain the heaven, now might raise Himself on pinions of eternal youth; The latitude, the amplitude of truth He might for ever now achieve, made nigh To those serener regions of the sky Above all change, where no time-cloud doth sail, But an eternal zephyr waves the veil Of changeless azure, and earth's days return Like a faint blush below; ah, he might learn Eternal joy and stillness. Shall he so? Far other destiny doth Love bestow Upon the children whom he honours most: For at that mighty moment, when the coast Of heaven he might in ecstasy attain, Yawns the dread cave wherein the dead remain; The sea-god's statue, like a giant bole Uprooted, leaps from out the charnel-hole; And Love, the exalter, is the summoner To places all with writhing shades astir; A peal of groans comes ringing on his ear, And the distressful furrows toss with fear, And he descends; whom not all sorrow's art Could ransom from the pangs of sorrow's heart. To Summer. Thou who dost set the prop to crooked arms Of apple-trees that labour with their store; Who givest sunshine to the nestling farms Along the valley, that their roofs may pore More placidly upon the open sky; Thou who dost bid the poplars swing so high Through thy sweet breath, and pourest rustling waves Of air along the forest-fledged hill; Who by the shore dost froth the ocean caves With green translucent billows, coming still Till the clear reefs and hollows sob and thrill; Imperial summer, thou art nigh; Giver of sweetness, thou art come; Magician of the soul's melodious gloom, Whisperer of heaven, great queen of poesy. I see thee lead the weeping morning up, That thy bright sun may kiss away her tears; I see thee drench thy moon in dewy cup, Which from the roses Hebe evening bears; High in the heaven is set thy smouldering tower Of cloudy watch for many a noontide hour; Whence thou descendest on the misty vale Far off, and in green hollows all thine own Leanest thy brow, for loving languor pale, While some sweet lay of love is let alone, Or some sweet whisper dies away unknown: Then with the sunset thou dost rise, And mournfully dost mark Thy softening clouds subdued into the dark, The shutting of thy flowers, and thy bereaved skies. Yet thou must fade, sweet nurse of budded boughs; Thy beauty hath the tenderness of death; Thy fickle sun is riding from thine house; Thy perfect fulness waits for withering breath: Already, see, the broad-leaved sycamore Drops one by one his honours to the floor: For his wide mouths thou canst no longer find, Poor mother that thou art, the needful food; The air doth less abound with nectar kind; And soon his brethren of the prosperous wood Shall paler grow; thou shalt be sallow-hued, Mother, too soon; dies too The aspiration thou hast sent, The thrilling joy, the sweet content That live with trees so green and heavens so blue. Ode on Departing Youth. His icicle upon the frozen bough Stern winter hangs, where hung the leaf ere now: In soft diffusion doth the morning creep Along the clouded heaven from mound to mound, So faint and wan, the woods are still asleep, And pallid shadows scarcely mark the ground. Then comes the thought, Alas that summer dies; Alas that youth should melancholy grow In waning hours, and lose the alchemies That make its thickest clouds with gold to glow! But what hast thou to do, Whose soul is strong, with time? What cause hast thou To watch the flitting years leave bare the bough Of life's fair tree, as yonder bough is left Unhonoured and bereft To wave unheeded in the ashen sky: Stern spirit, thou canst feel Eternal pinions grow with nerves of steel To wing thee on thy flight; And eyes of vision true And resolutely bright To aid thee in the track thou must pursue With instinct sure and expectation high. So rather in the dubious years which part Manhood from youth, reflects the very heart How small the loss that perished with the time That was its prime. What has been lost save hopes and fears That shook tumultuary spears Beside the desolate fount of tears? What has been lost save beating ears That sought for praise in all the tides of air, And thrust upon the trembling heart despair, Because they gathered coldness, scoff, and scorn; Save sorrow desperately forlorn: What, save vain thoughts that strove in trembling doubt To wander all the universe about, The woods, the fields; and in an airy ring To compass everything? But now 'tis sweet to know that whatsoe'er The lot may be the cold stars bid thee share, One ember plucked from dying youth Shall ever burn, and that isâNoble Truth. Unto the soul that upward still hath striven Shall Noble Truth reveal herself from heaven: This shall survive and be a living shoot From which the dead earth falls, and glorious fruit Shall spring from this: and still thou mayst behold How divine substance lieth underneath The many forms of life, the dust of death: And Poetry, that wondrous thing, doth mould Itself around the meanest thing that is; Clinging, like music in an echoing cave, Round what were dismal else; with equal kiss Touching the gilded tyrant and his slave. Sympathy; an Ode. Wild are the dreams of youth, While all is yet unknown; The bitterness, the ruth With which the world doth groan; The cares that weigh like stone, And fretful pangs uncouth. Then all is changed; behold The gloomy fiend, the minister of ill, Who haunteth human life In shapes as manifold As there are joys, or promises of joy; Who hath as many stings wherewith to kill As there are happy creatures to destroy. And hath he power to wound That concord with his strife, That harmony, that confidence In which divinest youth is lapped; to chill That exultation fine, That rapture of the sense? With sweat of agony To bow that forehead to the ground Which should be lifted to the gentle air, And bathed in nature's soft serenity; Serenity divine Of influences fair? Yes, even so it is: Despondency and fear Can limit all the scope, curtail the bliss: Or bitter care to dross Can turn each golden year; Or penury makes bare Her lean and threatening arm, Turning with surest pangs all gain to loss; Like a dissolving charm, That leaves a wretch forlorn In some foul sorceress' bosom lying Whom he had deemed most fair; With spasm the wretch is dying; His dream did not his life outlast; The while a palsy wind Shakes the green wood behind. And yet life's visionary part may be Preserved, O Sympathy, by thee: Sweet goddess, gentle child Of heaven, sister of love, Distilling in the spirit Thine own sweet manna from above Rare and mild: Dispelling by thy power The fiends that darkly lower O'er the chaotic scene of human strife; The fiends that did from curses old inherit The power to make the earth unearthly, And gender phantoms of vacuity Upon the hideous semblances of life. What, if the sea far off Do make its endless moan; What, if the forest free Do wail alone; And the white clouds soar Untraced in heaven from the horizon shore? What, if all nature's mystery Ear cannot hear, eye cannot see, While men with mutual scoff, Tortured and torturing, wage From broken youth to hideous age, A hellish war on one another's peace? No reed that's shaken with the wind need we Go out to see; Nor lean an aching ear upon the shore To listen for the ocean's roar: Nay, should the havoc and the strife increase, And drag us downward to the core Of the foul battle, thou, oh Goddess, thou, Divinest Sympathy, canst evermore Send grand remembrance to the brow Of shapes long worshipped in the green Poetic world, and evermore Send whispers of the glories all unseen, So that the common walks of life do soar Into wide haunted grot, and dim receding shore. And deep the meaning thou canst show In that which seemeth sad and base; More tragic then if pompous: see The squalid crowd that lines yon alley low: Irradiate by thy light, oh Sympathy, They're spirits than Prometheus grander, Furies more awful than Tisiphone; And mightier issues in their pale looks glow Than ever were in fable read; While gaunt and fierce they wander Along the dingy street for daily bread. Sorrow: a Sonnet. Through pity for the world I scarcely feel Great poetry to have a charm for me: From thought am I called off by crowds that reel Along the frozen streets in penury: The infant with its soft and chilly hands Seeks nourishment amid dishonouring rags; The pauper man in desolation stands:â And this increases so, the soul it drags From meditating in the fair domain Of all the glorious past of thought and man. My heart is down; my pinions strive in vain; Great poetry not now their plumes will fan. Ah, who can glory in poetic pages, Where life with want its bitter battle wages? The Human Destiny: a Sonnet. As run the rivers on through shade and sun, As flow the hours of time through day and night, As through her swelling year the earth rolls on, Each part in alternation dark and light: So rolls and flows with more prodigious change The human destiny; in gloom profound And horror of great darkness, or made strange By sudden light that shines from heaven around: Now in it works a fate inopportune, Deadly, malicious; now the mortal scene Smiles comforted with some eternal boon, And blood is turned to dew of roseate sheen: But whether weal or woe, life onward flows: Whither, oh, whither? Not an angel knows. Humanity: a Sonnet. There is a soul above the soul of each, A mightier soul, which yet to each belongs: There is a sound made of all human speech, And numerous as the concourse of all songs: And in that soul lives each, in each that soul, Though all the ages are its lifetime vast; Each soul that dies, in its most sacred whole Receiveth life that shall for ever last. And thus for ever with a wider span Humanity o'erarches time and death; Man can elect the universal man, And live in life that ends not with his breath, And gather glory that increaseth still Till Time his glass with Death's last dust shall fill. Death. I grieve not at the thought of pain, I wear no eye of gloom, Though with the halting funeral train I stand beside the tomb; And in the fading of earth's light My torch becomes a plume. Besides the perished form do I Preserving balms inter; I burn the costly spicery Of rosemary and myrrh; I bind about my happy brow The ever-during fir. Upon the hillock of the grave I plant the living sod; Each atom of earth's dust I save To be returned to God: There is an angel great and dread In each revered clod. The Warrior. Warriors camp, Horses champ, Deep battalions onward tramp; And the war From afar Gathers under lurid star. Rolled and marshalled it shall be Into battle's mystery; Rank on serried rank shall press, Dauntless, ceaseless, numberless. All around Shall the sound Of the furious strokes rebound; Far away O'er the fray Shall the sword in lightning play: And the battle's dusty veil Mingled with the cloud shall sail, And the bleeding warrior must Make his shroud of battle dust. Far afield Shall my shield Flame behind the sword I wield: Few shall stand Where the brand Smiteth in my heavy hand. Concealment: the Story of a Gentleman of Dauphiny. The original of this story is found in Contes et Nouvelles de Margarette de Valois Reine de Navarre. A love too much concealed, too little known, May lead but to the grave; as ye shall own Who con with me this simple history. There lived within the bounds of Dauphiny In ancient times a noble gentleman, Whose fair renown through all the country ran For gentle valour and sweet courtesy: But though renowned, alas, not rich was he. This gentleman long loved a demoiselle Of wondrous beauty, whom they named La Belle; She was of lordly house and high estate; And he, albeit his passion was so great, Too modestly did love to wish that she Should ever match below her own degree: He loved because she was most loveable, But sought her not, not understanding well That love has right above both house and wealth: Wherefore he never sought by shifty stealth, As do poor lovers, for her favour high; But if by any chance he should be nigh, Then in her presence would he keep and smile, And let deep love consume his heart the while. And so long time he fared, until at last, I know not how, his passion overpast The strictness of the tone and look he wore; And she, who never had been loved before, So tender young she was, a flower in bud, Discerned, and on the sudden understood: And glad she was in simple faith to be Beloved so nobly and so honestly; Nought knowing of the dreadful train of love, But joyful that she might another move, As him she moved, with rapture and delight, Only by living in her lover's sight. So now more oft he came, nor sought to hide His love, though words to it he still denied. But who in love can be unnoted?âSoon The world began to whisper, and anon The whisper rose into a louder hum; And lastly to the countess did it come, The mother countess: she, a widow left With that one child, La Belle, was not bereft Of pity for a lover; but respect For the world's mandates that soft pity checked. Too long had she by virtuous maxims kept Virtue to know, if virtue overstept Its own precinct: a keeper of the door Not far did she the temple wide explore, The fane which love for deity doth own, Creation's centre, being's very throne; To which the very entrance none can find Without refinement of the sense and mind, While to its centre earthly visitant May never pierce, for there for ever pant Love's spiritual fires through endless days, And in that noon joy's shadow falls both ways. Such is the court, the universe of love, So far its inmost shrine our hopes above. But faithful souls, like voyagers, behold The far-off glory as a dawn of gold, The supreme glory shedding constant beams, Which thread the opal spheres in softer gleams, And softer, that Love's voyagers may know The wonders of the way by which they go. They see Love's planets, like the lamps of night, Set in their spheres of softness and delight: Or if it be a fane that is most fit To image forth the throne where Love doth sit In sacredness, they see the pillars rise Of shafted constancy towards the skies In that world-temple; widely rolls between The unfathomed basement and the vault serene The incense cloud of an eternal fitness, Of which fair dreams are minister and witness; And its foundations are unwritten faith, Truer than covenant, stronger than death, More gleaming than a rock of chrysophrase. These marvels may he see who keeps the ways Of love through life, and countless marvels more: But who the blinded vision may restore Of those who cease to love, nor honour love In his true worshippers; what herald dove Swathes with white plume and flashing Iris-gleam The hapless soul that has forgot to dream? The mother bade that lover keep away From his beloved, lest the world should say Some venomed thing; and he her words obeyed, And for long months away from her he stayed, Till the world's bruit had ceased; nor did he wear A brow of sadness, but did still repair To all his haunts, and busily he strove: But as his absence grew, so grew his love. So passed the time, until, as it befel, Another lover came to woo La Belle, Not so much richer than this gentleman, Nor of such name; and soon the rumour ran That they should wed: this when our lover heard, âIt is but ill that he should be preferred,â Thought he, âto me, who have so truly loved; I tarried not for this; I am removed By one less worth than me; nay, who can tell If in her secret mind she love me well? Then am I much to blame that from neglect I have let go her service, and have checked Her shamefaced thought: I will return and see If there be any hope reserved for me.â From the pine-bearing height on which he dwelt He took his way, and sweet enchantment felt To go to her once more; he knew the way Full well, and followed it for half the day, Until her pleasant mansion came in sight Amid the poplars; and he did alight, With wild expectance poised in balance fine. Now hath he for the poplar changed the pine; Those ladies in their little garden ground, The mother countess and La Belle, he found; Grey walls the place confined, yellow with moss, And with trained fruit-trees burgeoned, and across Went gravel walks amid the greenest sward, And many pointed cypresses on guard Lifted their darker spires; amidst there was A marble fountain rising in the grass. And there that lover entered and beheld Those ladies walking; toward them he impelled His hasty feet, and said at once whate'er He did before within his mind prepare. Ah, wherefore had he never told before The secret which so long his bosom bore? Ah, what avails it all the tale to tell Of love that at one touch in sorrow fell; Why utter now the words which told him all Befallen which he deemed could not befal, His own love being such; why speak again The words that he shall still revolve in pain For many months, still muttering like a charm Of ill the syllables that wrought him harm? What said the countess, and what said La Belle? Enough to know that love in ruins fell, Love's eloquence was quenched; too late afield Was love; and, having lain so long concealed, Put forth its pennons vainly now at last. He found La Belle by plighted faith bound fast, But not to him, and married soon to be; And there was deprecation; sophistry Of comfort; rapid words which ever strove To make the whole a commonplace of love Soon to be ended: then said he, âAdieu, None other shall I ever love than you.â Now hath he changed the poplar for the pine. Full slowly rode he home through shade and shine, Along the valley, o'er the rising ridge, And past the hollow roaring by the bridge, And by the torrent rushing from the steep: The rain-cloud rode above him; out did sweep The rainbow, where cold rain at distance fell; And faded as some autumn cloud did swell In purple o'er the sun behind his back. So dizzily he gained the homeward track, And entered wearily among the pines: His kennelled hounds with cries and lengthened whines At his appearance leaped their length of chain: âFarewell,â said he, âmy dogs, ye call in vain.â And in the pain of that refusal he Could take no rest, but ever listlessly Roamed up and down the flinty mountain path; Until at length by small degrees he hath Begun to fall away; and in such sort Was changed, that those who saw him did report His death at hand; nay, death itself they said Was painted in his visage: now his bed He kept, and any moment he might die. A certain man soon brought this public cry Unto the countess, and much urged that she, As she was charitable, should go see The dying man, and take with her La Belle; With him they went, who guided them full well. They climbed the mountain by the flinty way Which led above the pines; the dogs did bay, As they went past, the dogs that soon should be Masterless; and from out the dark green tree The pheasant whirred; anon the latch they lift And stand within the chamber; his last shrift The dying man had made, and had received Communion, and, that holy task achieved, Expected nought to see or hear again; He was so meagre that it was a pain To recognize him: a most pallid green O'erspread his visage, and the Rood between His strained hands lay; but as on them he gazed, His force so much returned that he half raised His body, and the countess thus addressed. âAh, madam, thou art come to lay at rest A man who deemed himself already gone, Whom you have slain; ah, this is rightly done; How come you here?â Then sheââNay, say not so; Nay, what a sight is here, and what a woe; Nay, say not we have slain whom overmuch We ever loved.âââMadam,â said he, âDeath's clutch Is on me; let me say I have concealed, All that I might, my state; 'tis now revealed; So is the love I bear your daughter dear, Whom ever I have served with mind sincere; But all my hope I lost through haplessness; Yet now I speak not of mine own distress, Which grieves me now no more, but I lament For her, that she hath lost the man content Above all men to love and serve her well: For I am sure, while she on earth may dwell, She ne'er shall meet with one to love her so. But I must leave her, I away must go And leave her in the world, and it is this That irks me more than all the good I miss, For I desired never to preserve My wretched life, but that I might her serve, And I may perish now that hope is dead.â All this they wept to hear, and then thus said The countess: âCourage, my beloved friend, For here I swear, if heaven thy life defend, La Belle shall never wed but only thee; Here she is present, and doth well agree.â But hope in that dead soul grew not again, And he replied, âLady, if that so vain And bootless solace but three months agone Had been bestowed, I should have been the one Most vigorous and happy in all France.â But as that promise still they did advance, At last he said, âSince ye so kindly seem, One thing I ask which never did I deem Myself so hardy as to think;â and they That he should confidently ask did pray. Then he, âLet me but hold awhile the head Of her whom here you proffer me to wed, Within my arms.â La Belle was sore afraid At that request, but straight her mother bade Do as he said, perceiving death to be So fixed upon his countenance that he Was scarce a man: and toward the bed she went And knelt beside it; he was nearly spent, But soon he roused himself, and 'gan to stretch His thin arms round her, and her face to fetch To his pale face: âNow have I all that e'er In all my life to hope for I did dare: For how that I have loved thee utterly With gentle faith and perfect honesty, God knows; and now right willingly I die: God who is Love and Perfect Charity Knows I lie not; and I am ready now For my Creator.â Here he back did bow, Yet rallied once again toward her face, And with such fervour struggled to embrace, That in the very strife a corpse he lay. Now he was nobly buried, as they say, For many a lover came from fair Provence To follow in the train; and through all France They sang of him; but if his wandering ghost Could feel a triumph on the gloomy coast Of silent darkness, at those obsequies Its greatest triumph was the tears and cries Of that poor demoiselle for whom he died: For scarce could she be severed from his side When earth received him; and through all her days, In champaign green or sought by lover's praise, Remembered his lost image, full of pain, Nor ever after that funereal train Of veritable joy did taste again. Perversity: the Story of Ermolai. It is the time to tell of fatal love; Though all the woods are vocal with the dove, The nodding chesnut sees the white clouds build In summer skies; and all the air is filled With lightsome fragrance from the flowering lime, And toward the low-hung boughs the thickets climb: It is the time to tell of fatal love. For were the woods not vocal with the dove, And bluest skies gave light through heart and mind, When Ermolai through forest paths did wind To see his lady Columbe joyfull? A goodly knight he was; you could not see A man more gaily strong, nor sight more fair Than his white horse, steel arms, and yellow hair, As he rode onward all the afternoon: And when in clearest ether hung the moon, His courser paced along the darkening lake O'er which fair Columbe's castle lights 'gan shake. She was a lady of most high degree, The daughter of Duke Ebenhard, and he A councillor unto the emperor: But her blue eyes and pearly features wore Such gentleness, that whoso saw her, straight Forgot for love her birth and high estate. And she has welcomed her brave lover now From balcony, while in the yard below His steed upon the stones was clattering, And he both eyes and heart did upward fling. And now they both together sit at board, Fronting the fiery eyes of Ebenhard; Where too sat Columbe's foster sister dear, Alice the fair; with shortness ye shall hear That her wild eyes and wondrous looks have caught Knight Ermolai, and such enchantment wrought, That now he drew with pain to Columbe sweet His erring eyes, and painfully did greet Her words of love, when lovingly she spake. All night upon his bed he lay awake, And tossed and muttered; all the night he had Her mighty beauty in his vision sad, As he were haunted; sure the fiend had wrought Some wicked spell on him to change his thought. Then when the dawn came through his window grey, He took his sword and gown, and made his way To Strepan's chamber, whom asleep he foundâ Strepan his varlet, cunning as a hound To track vagaries by the fancy bred. âStrepan,â he cried, standing beside his bed, âNo wretch was ever so undone as I; For came I not 'neath yester even's sky Loving fair Columbe?âah, I love her still; But conqueror love hath wrought me bitter ill, For now I love all madly Alice fair.â Then Strepan answered, trembling, âSir, beware The wrath of her high sire, duke Ebenhard; No duke so fiery, rigorous, and hard: Sure this is but a moment's phantasy, For think that Columbe is thy bride to be.â âSilence,â said Ermolai, âI fear not aught His anger; neither do I set at nought Sweet Columbe; no, by heaven, this sword should slay The man who would her beauty dear unsay; To die for her were easy, but to liveâ Ah, love hath other law, ah love doth give Other command; I tell thee, some control Beyond e'en life is laid upon my soul: For can the gentle moon with all her light The sun-flower turn? Nay, never star of night Can move the buds that open with the sun: So 'tis in love; the soul obeys but one: But wherefore preach I?ârather by the oath Of Love himself I plight no other troth Than to this Alice, whom I wholly love; Wherefore must thou thy skill most shortly prove, Devising how we may together flee Home to my castle, married there to be.â âGrant me three days,â quoth crafty Strepan here, âSince thou art lunatic, my thoughts to clear.â âGranted,â said Ermolai, âbut have a care Thou fail me not; and yet, alas, I swear That Columbe is the sweetest, the most fair Of all beside: ah, Columbe, whatsoe'er Thou shalt hereafter think of me, I trow If thou the pangs that now I feel couldst know, Thou wouldst forgive me all, oh sweetest, best.â With that so sore a passion him oppressed That we must pity him; there is no pain Like dying love; for to the altered brain The unaltered heart still sends its rich supplies; But some usurper strange now occupies The old receptacle within the mind Where the poor heart its harbour used to find For all the pulsive tides of love that wont To have their issue from its sacred font. An image new hath entered through the sense, And a new form must make impression thence Upon the cordial substance still so warm With the impression of the older form. So wills imperial fancy, and in vain The heart doth beat with penitential pain, In vain resists, and from its arteries Withdraws the genial current, and denies That newer love the ancient form efface; In vain returns it to its ancient place, And righteously refuseth to transmit Its vital current to the cruel wit: In vain is this; the heart must beat again Through all reluctance of repentant pain; In none the heart and mind are long apart; Imperial fancy overrules the heart. Yet this is full of pain to whomsoe'er It happens; and inconstancy must bear This righteous pain; nor this alone, for now The ancient habit more afflicts the brow Than the new joy rewards; perish anon, When the attractive force of thought is gone, The outward pomps of love, the imageries Of beauty, by the sensibilities Invested with sweet power, the atmosphere Circling the lover; fades the face of her Beloved but lately, fades the pleasant land In which but now he wandered fragrance-fanned, Waited by rosy clouds of happy pride, Sweet interests, warbling shapes, and pageants wide: It is for him no more; he is shut out From Eden by default, and all about The blessed region walks he hand in hand With gravest Memory; but he is banned, A wretch forlorn, whom no new love beguiles With all the happiness of older smiles. Ah, this is pain; no divine influence Can ebb away, and leave an easy sense; No heart can throb and cast rejected tide Toward fancy's airy bourne, but there must ride On each returning wave some bitter pain. The three days past, his course hath Strepan ta'en Toward a neighbouring mound, whereon was piled Great store of faggots, meant as signal wild Of some fierce enemy approaching near: The heap he fired at midnight dark and drear, In stormy sky arose the balefire's light, Anon the courtyard swarmed with serf and knight, And forth they rushed in nightly cavalcade To meet the fancied foe in woodland shade. So when the wrathful duke and all his men Were far away, the running Strepan then Led round a mighty horse from Barbary And Ermolai's white charger, and they flee, Alice and Ermolai, and very soon Was Ermolai watching the half-wrecked moon In cloudy waves from his own lattice high, While his own mother trembling faltered nigh Holding his out-flung hand, and in the room Fair Alice crouched and sobbed amid the gloom: âGood night,â at last said he, âfull tenderly My gentle bird in cage shall tended be: Gently, my mother, keep her blessed head, 'Tis but a little time and we shall wed.â Few days were past before the wrathful duke With many mustered knights his journey took Of vengeance to the garde of Ermolai; But ere they yet were marching on their way, Sweet Columbe, left deserted, left alone, Called on whom she could trust, who straight is gone Before the host with messages from her: She sent a napkin wet with many a tear, A jewel, too, she sent in gold enset, And poisoned 'twas; thus did she legend it: âAlice, receive this napkin; 'tis thy due; Wet with my tears, which not another drew; Receive this poisoned ring; and unto me If thou be false, let this be death to thee; But if thou wilt repent, return before The wrathful duke shall slay my love in war; And straight I will forgive thee; but if still Thy purpose holds to have thy wicked will, I charge thee, send the poison back to me.â Thus having said, she sunk down utterly Dissolved in pain upon the marble floor, And there she lay, while past the yawning door The martial knights strode forth in fierce array; None knew how long in deadly swoon she lay. How did fair Alice take those tokens sad? Her eyes did beam within most piteous-glad, The napkin at her bosom's core she dried, The poisoned ring she took, and straightway hied Down the black staircase into the wide hall, Where Ermolai beneath the banners tall After the nightly banquet slumbered now Upon the table; trouble marked his brow, And ruffled hair, in which his hands were thrust: That lady tottered toward him, for she must Breathe one kiss o'er him ere she leave him there; Yet never stirred the sleeper unaware, And she through hall and corridor hath ranged, Her mighty beauty broken not, but changed; So left she him, and is to Columbe fled: âSister, behold thy poisoned ring,â she said, âAnd take again thy love.â No more she could, But in sharp sorrow broke her womanhood: And Columbe kissed her, and they two abode As if fate never made on faith inroad. Meanwhile the host of Ebenhard drew near And sieged the castle; first a messenger They sent to seek if Alice therein lay: This Ermolai distracted answered, Yea. Then they the place assaulted, and the knight With followers few resisted all he might, Till they have gained the wall with joyous shout, And Ermolai half-dead with wounds drawn out. They sought for Alice all about the ground, In much amaze when nowhere she was found, And many a curse upon the knight they laid, Deeming that she was foully murdered. The wrathful duke gave sentence that the knight, As one who had to honour done despite, Should on a cart be drawn to market square, And lose his head: him now the varlets bear To dungeon deep, enshackled heavily. Now when fair Alice heard the public cry That Ermolai should perish in this sort, Unto the emperor she did resort, And did entreat him of his clemency To spare that knight, for that no felony By him had been committed; and she won From that great king her prayer; but thereupon Was this condition added, that he wed Columbe the fair, or else not save his head, If he refused; or if Columbe no more Would of his love, it should be as before; Or if fierce Ebenhard disdainfully Refused to grant it so, still must he die. Then Alice fair returned, and soon she brought The tender Columbe to accept the thought, For if she did refuse, then must he die: And Ebenhard, albeit right stormily, Accepted also, for he once had loved Sir Ermolai, and was to pity moved, Now when he found fair Alice was returned: 'Twas punishment enough that he had burned His castle and the knight in prison cast, Sore wounded; nor did he mislike at last The desperate courage of that frantic knight; And grimly laughed he thinking of the night When Ermolai had drawn him from his tower, Booted and armed, the sightless hills to scour. Now came the morning when the knight was led Upon the felon cart to lose his head: About that hearse the thronging people come, And some did shout, some were for pity dumb, Some wept his youth; but he with unmoved eyes Erected sat, and none could know what sighs His spirit at the thought of Alice gave, E'en as he travelled to his bloody grave. Ah, thought he not of Columbe? He no more Of Columbe thought, though at the first so sore Had been his penitence for all her wrong; For after Alice left him, madly strong Had grown of her his love infatuate, And oft did he suspect, the while he sate Besieged within his hold, that Columbe had Decoyed and slain her; and resentment mad Surged in his soul, and fury born of hell: All this did penitential shame expel, And Columbe had deceased in his regret: Now too of his captivity the fret, The long elapse of time, his wasted lands, His followers slain, his wounds, and shameful bands, The sentence of his death, these things endured For Alice, these his piteous heart ensured And stubborned still for Alice; for to seem A sufferer for love is love's own dream: By suffering his heart had purged remorse, And flung that burden gladly from its course; And, filled with Alice, to the last event Bound straitly on the shameful cart he went. When lo, what magic to his shaping mind Completes her image, that his eye should find Fair Alice there? She in the street doth stand, Holding her sister Columbe by the hand, For so they had resolved that, as he hied, He should be ransomed from his deadly ride In front of death itself; and presently Her voice assures him more that it is she, Bespeaking himââSir knight, why rid'st thou there? Behold thou shalt now wed this lady fair, And thou art lightly free from all thy woe; The emperor wills, and she consents thereto, Duke Ebenhard consents; therefore rejoice.â But when her face he saw, and heard her voice, His bonds he shook as if he madman were; And Ebenhard bade loose him from the chair, Deeming he would to Columbe go; but he Ran but to Alice fair: ah, tenderly Weep ye who hapless love commiserate, Weep ye who know how faith succumbs to fate, And love is mingled with perversity: For he to Alice went, and tenderly He sought to compass her in his arms twain: But she began to say her words again, And pointed him to Columbe for his love, And more repelled him as the more he strove. More piteous that strife than very death. Right so came Ebenhard with furious breath At this despite, and shouted to the train That they should mount him on the hearse again, And draw the cutting bonds unto the bone: Whereat fair Columbe with most heavy moan Prayed mercy, horror-stricken she to find Such horror; eagerly she now resigned Her love to Alice, that her wrathful sire Might therefore from his threats of death retire. Like to two doves that rise upon the air With head and wing embracing, so in prayer Those sisters were, as they did there contend. Ah, bootlessly their tears they did expend, They could not stay the falling doom of fate, Nor into pity altered angry hate, Nor stopped the creaking of the deadly wain; Now haste we to despatch this doleful train. When Alice fair perceived they might not stay This woeful deed;ââ'Tis I must die to-day,â 'Gan she to say, and from her bosom snatched That poisoned ring which Columbe had despatched Before to her; and this she raised on high; âThat ye may live,â she said, â'tis I must die.â She turned it round where it in gold was set, âThis deed from you a benediction get:â She thrust the poison through her white white teeth, âGod give to all the joy of my last breath;â She set the ring around fair Columbe's hand, âI wed thee unto him; oh, understand That thus to both of you my love is known.â She fell before them dead as any stone. But Ermolai passed on to lose his head; And they returning found fair Columbe dead, Dead in a fatal swoon upon the ground, And on her hand the poisoned ring they found. Rapture: an Ode. I. What is this? The white and crumbling clouds leave bare the blue; Shines out the central sun with golden hue; And all the fruit-trees, rolling blossom-boughed, Are white and billowy as the rolling cloud. The warm beam bedded sleeps upon the trees, The springing thickets and the gorse-bound leas; Sleeps where I lie at ease, Pulling the ruby orchis and the pale Half-withered cowslip from the hill-side grass, Midway the brow that overhangs the vale, Where the sleepy shadows pass, And the sunbeam sleeps till all is grown Into one burning sapphire stone, All air, all earth, each violet-deepened zone. II. It sleeps and broods upon the moss-mapped stone, The thready mosses and the plumy weeds; Numbers the veined flowers one after one, Their colours and their leaves and ripening seeds: Above, around, its influence proceeds; It tracks in gleams the stream through crowding bush, And beds of sworded flags and bearded rush, Where slow it creeps along the lower ground; The ridges far above are all embrowned, The golden heavens over all are ploughed In furrows of fine tissue that abound, And melting fragments of the whitest cloud. III. Ah, what is this, that now with sated eyes And humming ears the soul no more descries? Drawn back upon the spirit all the sense Becomes intelligence; And to be doubly now unfolded feels That which itself reveals; Double the world of all that may appear To eye or hand or ear; Double the soul of that which apprehends By that which sense transcends. IV. For deep the cave of human consciousness; The thoughts, like light, upon its depths may press, Seeking and finding wonders numberless; But never may they altogether pierce The hollow gloom so sensitive and fierce Of the deep bosom: far the light may reach, There is a depth unreached; in clearest speech There is an echo from an unknown place: And in the dim, unknown, untrodden space Our life is hidden; were we all self-known, No longer should we live; a wonder shown Is wonderful no more; and being flies For ever from its own self-scrutinies. Here is the very effort of the soul To keep itself unmingled, safe, and whole In changes and the flitting feints of sense: Here essence holds a calm and sure defence; It is a guarded shrine and sacred grove, A fountain hidden where no foot may rove, A further depth within a sounded sea; A mirror 'tis from hour to hour left free By things reflected: and because 'tis so, Therefore the outer world and all its show Is as the music of the upper wave To the deep Ocean in his sunken cave; A part of its own self, yet but its play, Which doth the sunbeam and the cloud convey To central deeps, where in awful shade The stormless heart receives the things conveyed, Knowing the cloud by darkness, and the light By splendours dying through the infinite. V. And being such the soul doth recognize The doubleness of nature, that there lies A soul occult in Nature, hidden deep As lies the soul of man in moveless sleep. And like a dream Broken in circumstance and foolish made, Through which howe'er the future world doth gleam, And floats a warning to the gathered thought, Like to a dream, Through sense and all by sense conveyed, Into our soul the shadow of that soul Doth float. Then are we lifted up erect and whole In vast confession to that universe Perceived by us: our soul itself transfers Thither by instinct sure; it swiftly hails The mighty spirit similar; it sails In the divine expansion; it perceives Tendencies glorious, distant; it enweaves Itself with excitations more than thought Unto that soul unveiled and yet unsought. VI. Ye winds and clouds of light, Ye lead the soul to God; The new-born soul that height With rapturous foot hath trod, And is received of God: God doth the soul receive Which mounts toward Him, and alone would dwell With Him; though finite with the Infinite, Though finite, rising with a might Like to infinitude. Gently receiving such He doth dispel All solitary horror with delight, Honouring the higher mood. VII. For though the soul pants with fierce ecstasy The unattainable to grasp, to be For ever mingled with infinity; And this in vain, since God Himself withdraws From human knowledge, e'en as its own laws Seclude the soul from sense; Yet not from love He hies; From love God never flies. Love is the soul's best sense, which God descries, Which bares the covert of intelligence: And, honouring in love the higher mood, With lovely joys He fills the solitude Of His own presence, whither trusting Him The soul hath mounted: lo, it might have found Utter destruction on this higher ground, Tenuity of air and swooning dim For lack of breath; but now it finds hereby A lovely vesture of infinity, And ecstasies that nourish ecstasy. God giveth love to love, and ministers Substance to substance; life to life He bears. VIII. Therefore, ye winds and ye High moving clouds of light, Ye rivers running free, Thou glory of the sea, Thou glory of the height, The gleam beside the bush, The tremble of the rush, To me made manifest, The beauty of the flower In summer's sunny power, Portions of entity supreme ye be, And motions massed upon eternal rest. IX. Broad breezes, clouds of light, Thither ye lead the soul, To this most sacred height Above the sacred whole: The azure world is not so fair, The azure world and all the circling air, As that true spiritual kingdom known Unto the spirit only and alone; Thither the soul ye bear, Oh winds and clouds of light. X. Ye winds and clouds of light, That bear the soul to God; The new-born soul that height By ecstasy hath trod. Late Repentance. Oh that this kiss with life could warm The whitened lips it dies upon; That these hot tears could warm to life That brow more chill than marble stone. Another hour, and they shall come To bear thee to the last repose; Beloved, I must take my leave; This is the close, this is the close. Wear not to me that look of peace, That peaceful look of silent rest, Unlike the look of calm enforced, When thy still spirit lay oppressed; Unliko the look which ever sought My way ward moods to know and meet; Oh could that gaze come back again, And raise those wistful eyelids sweet, That I might kiss it all away, And bid it so for ever cease, And fall upon my knees and pray, And spend my life to win thee peace! Oh, I could madden o'er thy form, But I thy rest should discompose; Thy arm falls coldly back again; Is this the close, is this the close? Song. The feathers of the willow Are half of them grown yellow Above the swelling stream; And ragged are the bushes, And rusty now the rushes, And wild the clouded gleam. The thistle now is older, His stalk begins to moulder, His head is white as snow; The branches all are barer, The linnet's song is rarer, The robin pipeth now.</field>
