For thou?t, constreint, and greuous heuines, For pensifhede, and for hei? distres, To bed I went nov þis oþir ny?t, Whan þat Lucina wiþ hir pale li?t Was Ioyned last wiþ Phebus in aquarie, Amyd decembre, when of Ianuarie Ther be kalendes of þe nwe yere, And derk Diane, ihorned, noþing clere, Had [hid] hir bemys vndir a mysty cloude: Wiþin my bed for sore I gan me shroude, Al desolate for constreint of my wo, The long[e] ny?t waloing to and fro, Til at[te] last, er I gan taken kepe, Me did oppresse a sodein dedeli slepe, Wiþ-in þe which me þou?t[e] þat I was Rauysshid in spirit in [a] temple of glas— I nyst[e] how, ful fer in wildirnes— That foundid was, as bi lik[ly]nesse, Not opon stele, but on a craggy roche, Like ise Ifrore. And as I did approche, Again þe sonne that shone, me þou?t, so clere As eny cristal, and euer nere and nere As I gan neigh this grisli, dredful place, I wex astonyed: the li?t so in my face Bigan to smyte, so persing euer in one On euere part, where þat I gan gone, That I ne my?t noþing, as I would, Abouten me considre and bihold, The wondre estres, for bri?tnes of þe sonne; Til at[te] last certein skyes donne, Wiþ wind Ichaced, haue her cours I went To-fore þe stremes of Titan and Iblent, So þat I my?t, wiþ-in and with-oute, Where so I walk, biholden me aboute, Forto report the fasoun and manere Of al þis place, þat was circulere In compaswise, Round bentaile wrou?t. And whan þat I hade long gone &amp; sou?t, I fond a wiket, and entrid in as fast Into þe temple, and myn ei?en cast On euere side, now lowe &amp; eft aloft. And ri?t anone, as I gan walken soft, If I þe soth ari?t report[e] shal, I sau?e depeynt opon euere wal, From est to west, ful many a faire Image Of sondri louers, lich as þei were of age I-sette in ordre, aftir þei were trwe, Wiþ lifli colours wondir fressh of hwe. And, as me þou?t, I sau?e somme sit &amp; stonde, And some kneling wiþ billis in hir honde, And some with compleint, woful &amp; pitous, Wiþ doleful chere to putten to Venus, So as she sate fleting in þe se, Vpon hire wo forto haue pite. And first of al I saugh þere of Car[ta]ge Dido þe quene, so goodli of visage, That gan complein hir aduenture &amp; caas, Hov she deceyued was of Eneas, For al his hestis &amp; his oþis sworne, And said: ‘alas, þat euer she was borne,’ Whan þat she saugh þat ded she most[e] be. And next I saugh the compleint of Medee, Hou þat she was falsed of Iason. And nygh bi Venus saugh I sit Addoun, And al þe maner, hov þe bore him slough, For whom she wepte &amp; hade pein Inou?e. There saugh I also, hov Penalope, For she so long hir lord ne my?t[e] se, Ful oft[e] wex of colour pale &amp; grene. And aldernext was þe fressh[e] quene, I mene Alceste, the noble trw[e] wyfe, And for Admete hou sho lost hir life, And for hir trouth, if I shal not lie, Hou she was turnyd to a dai[e]sie. There was [also] Grisildis innocence, And al hir mekenes, &amp; hir pacience. There was eke Isaude—&amp; meni a noþir mo— And al þe turment, and al þe cruel wo, That she hade for Tristram al hir liue. And hou þat Tesbie her hert[e] did[e] rife Wiþ þilk[e] swerd of him Piramus; And al þe maner, hou þat Theseus The Minatawre slow amyd þe hous, That was for-wrynkked bi craft of Dedalus, When þat he was in prison shette in Crete. And hou þat Phillis felt of loues hete The grete fire of Demophon, alas, And for his falshed and [for] his trespas Vpon þe walles depeint men my?t[e] se, Hov she was honged vpon a filbert tre. And mani a stori, mo þen I rekin can, Were in þe tempil, &amp; hov þat Paris wan The faire Heleyne, þe lusti fressh[e] quene, And hov Achilles was for Policene I-slain vnwarli within Troi[e] toune: Al þis sawe I, [walkynge vp &amp; doun. Ther sawe I] writen eke þe hole tale, Hov Philomene into a ny?tyngale Iturned was, and Progne vnto a swalow; And hov þe Sabyns in hir maner halowe The fest of Lucresse ?it in Rome tovne. There saugh I also þe sorov of Palamoun, That he in prison felt, &amp; al þe smert, And hov þat he, þurugh vnto his hert, Was hurt vnwarli þurugh casting of an ey?e Of faire fressh, þe ?ung[e] Emelie, And al þe strife bitwene him &amp; his broþir, And hou þat one fau?t eke with þat oþir Wiþ-in þe groue, til þei bi Theseus Acordid were, as Chaucer telliþ us. And forþirmore, as I gan bihold, I saw? hov Phebus with an arow of gold I-woundid was, þuru? oute in his side, Onli bi envie of þe god Cupide, And hou þat Daphne vnto a laurer tre Iturned was, when she did[e] fle; And hou þat Ioue gan to chaunge his cope Oonli for loue of þe faire Europe, And into [a] bole, when he did hir sue, List of his godhode his fourme to transmwe; And hou þat he bi transmutacioun The shap gan take of Amphitrioun For hir, Almen, so passi[n]g of beaute; So was he hurt, for al his deite, Wiþ loues dart, &amp; my?t it not ascape. There sau? I also hou þat Mars was take Of Vulcanus, and wiþ Venus found, And wiþ þe Cheynes invisible bound. Ther was also al þe poesie Of him, Mercurie, and Phil[o]log[y]e, And hou þat she, for hir sapience, Iweddit was to god of eloquence, And hou þe Musis lowli did obeie, High into heuen þis ladi to conuei, And with hir song hov she was magnified With Iubiter to bein Istellified. And vppermore depeint men my?t[e] se, Hov with hir ring, goodli Canace Of euere foule þe ledne &amp; þe song Coud vndirstond, as she welk hem among; And hou hir broþir so oft holpen was In his myschefe bi þe stede of bras. And forþermore in þe tempil were Ful mani a þousand of louers, here &amp; þere, In sondri wise redi to complein Vnto þe goddes, of hir wo &amp; pein, Hou þei were hindrid, some for envie, And hou þe serpent of fals Ielousie Ful many a louer haþ iput o bak, And caus[e]les on hem Ilaid a lak. And some þer were þat pleyned on absence, That werin exiled &amp; put oute of presence Thuru? wikkid tungis &amp; fals suspecioun, [With-oute mercy or remyssyoun.] And oþer eke her seruise spent in vain, Thuru? cruel daunger, &amp; also bi disdain; And some also þat loued, soþ to sein, And of her ladi were not louyd again. And oþir eke, þat for pouerte Durst in no wise hir grete aduersite Discure ne open, lest þai were refusid; And some for wanting also werin accusid, And oþir eke þat loued secreli, And of her ladi durst aske no merci, Lest þat she would of hem haue despite; And some also þat putten ful grete wite On double louers, þat loue þingis nwe, Thurgh whos falsnes hindred be þe trwe. And some þer were, as it is oft[e] found, That for her ladi meny a blodi wounde Endurid haþ in mani [a] regioun, Whiles þat an oþer haþ poscessioun Al of his ladi, and beriþ awai þe fruyte Of his labur and of al his suyte. And oþer eke compleyned of Riches, Hou he with Tresour doþ his besines To wynnen al, againes kynd &amp; ry?t, Wher trw louers haue force noon ne my?t. And some þer were, as maydens ?ung of age, That pleined sore with peping &amp; with rage, That þei were coupled, againes al nature, Wiþ croked elde, þat mai not long endure Forto perfourme þe lust of loues plai: For it ne sit not vnto fressh[e] May Forto be coupled to oold[e] Ianuari— Thei ben so diuers þat þei most[e] varie— For eld is grucching &amp; malencolious, Ay ful of ire &amp; suspecious, And iouth entendeþ to Ioy &amp; lustines, To myrth &amp; plai &amp; to al gladnes. ‘Allas þat euer þat it shuld[e] fal, So soote sugre Icoupled be with gal!’ These yong[e] folk criden oft[e] siþe, And praied Venus hir pouer forto kiþe Vpon þis myschef, &amp; shape remedie. And ri?t anon I herd oþir crie With sobbing teris, &amp; with ful pitous soune, Tofore þe goddes, bi lamentacioun, That were constrayned in hir tender youþe, And in childhode, as it is oft[e] couþe, Yentred were into religioun, Or þei hade yeris of discresioun, That al her life cannot but complein, In wide copis perfeccion to feine, Ful couertli to curen al hir smert, And shew þe contrarie outward of her hert. Thus saugh I wepen many a faire maide, That on hir freendis al þe wite þei leide. And oþer next I saugh þere in gret rage, That þei were maried in her tendir age, Wiþ-oute fredom of eleccioun, Wher loue haþ seld domynacioun: For loue, at laarge &amp; [at] liberte, Would freli chese, &amp; not with such trete. And oþer saugh I ful oft wepe &amp; wring, [That they in men founde swych variynge,] To loue a seisoun, while þat beaute floureþ, And bi disdein so vngoodli loureþ On hir þat whilom he callid his ladi dere, That was to him so plesaunt &amp; entere; But lust with fairnes is so ouergone, That in her hert trouþ abideþ none. And som also I sau? in teris reyne, And pitousli on god &amp; kynd[e] pleyne, That euer þei would on eny creature So mych beaute, passing bi mesure, Set on a woman, to yeue occasioun A man to loue to his confusioun, And nameli þere where he shal haue no grace; For wiþ a loke, forth-bi as he doþ pace, Ful oft[e] falleþ, þuru? casting of an y?e, A man is woundid, þat he most nedis deye, That neuer efter perauenture shal hir se. Whi wil god don so gret a cruelte To eny man, or to his creature, To maken him so mych wo endure, For hir percaas, whom he shal in no wise Reioise neuer, but so forþ in Iewise Ledin his life, til þat he be graue. For he ne durst of hir no merci craue, And eke perauenture, þou? he durst &amp; would, He can not wit, where he hir find[e] shuld. I saugh þere eke, &amp; þerof hade I rouþe, That som were hindred for couetise &amp; slouth, And some also for her hastines, And oþer eke for hir reklesnes— But alderlast as I walk &amp; biheld, Beside Pallas wiþ hir cristal sheld, Tofore þe statue of Venus set on height, Hov þat þer knelid a ladi in my sy?t Tofore þe goddes, which ri?t as þe sonne Passeþ þe sterres &amp; doþ hir stremes donne, And Lucifer, to voide þe ny?tes sorow, In clerenes passeþ erli bi þe morow, And so as Mai haþ þe souereinte Of euere moneþ, of fairnes &amp; beaute, And as þe rose in swetnes &amp; odoure Surmounteþ floures, and bawme of al licour Haueþ þe pris, &amp; as þe rubie bri?t Of al stones in beaute &amp; in si?t, As it is know, haþ þe regalie: Ri?t so þis ladi wiþ hir goodli ei?e, And with þe stremes of hir loke so bri?t, Surmounteþ al þurugh beaute in my si?te: Forto tel hir gret semelines, Hir womanhed, hir port, &amp; hir fairnes, It was a meruaile, hou euer þat nature Coude in hir werkis make a creature So aungellike, so goodli on to se, So femynyn or passing of beaute, Whos sonnyssh here, bri?ter þan gold were, Lich Phebus bemys shynyng in his spere— The goodlihed eke of hir fresshli face, So replenysshid of beaute &amp; of grace, So wel ennuyd bi Nature &amp; depeint, That Rose and lileis togedir were so meint, So egalli bi good proporcioun, That, as me þou?t, in myn inspeccioun I gan meruaile, hou god, or werk of kynd, Mi?ten of beaute such a tresour find, To yeven hir so passing excellence. For in goode faiþ, þuru? hir hei? presence The tempil was enlumynd enviroun, And forto speke of condicioun, She was þe best þat my?t[e] ben on lyve: For þer was noon þat wiþ hir my?t[e] striue, To speke of bounte, or of gentilles, Of womanhed, or of lowlynes, Of curtesie, or of goodlihed, Of spech, of chere, or of semlyhed, Of port benygne, &amp; of daliaunce, The best[e] tau?t, &amp; þerto of plesaunce She was þe wel, and eke of oneste An exemplarie, &amp; mirrour eke was she Of secrenes, of trouth, of faythfulnes, And to al oþer ladi &amp; maistres, To sue vertu, whoso list to lere. And so þis ladi, benigne and humble of chere, Kneling I saugh, al clad in grene and white, Tofore Venus, goddes of al delite, Enbrouded al with stones &amp; perre So richeli, þat ioi it was to se, Wiþ sondri rolles on hir garnement, Forto expoune þe trouth of hir entent, And shew fulli, þat for hir humbilles, And for hir vertu, and hir stabilnes, That she was rote of womanli plesaunce. Therfore hir woord wiþoute variaunce Enbrouded was, as men my?t[e] se: ‘De mieulx en mieulx,’ with stones and perre: This [is] to sein þat she, þis benigue, From bettir to bettir hir hert[e] doþ resigne, And al hir wil, to Venus þe goddes, Whan þat hir list hir harmes to redresse. For as me þou?t sumwhat bi hir chere, Forto compleyne she hade gret desire: For in hir hond she held a litel bil, Forto declare þe somme of al hir wil, And to þe goddes hir quarel forto shewe, [Theffect of which was this In wordys fewe:] 1 ‘O ladi Venus, modir of Cupide, That al þis wor[l]d hast in gouernaunce, And hertes high, þat hauteyn [ben] of pride, Enclynyst mekeli to þin obeissaunce, Causer of ioie, Relese of penaunce, And with þi stremes canst eueri þing discerne Thuru? heuenli fire of loue þat is eterne; 2 O blisful sterre, persant &amp; ful of li?t, Of bemys gladsome, devoider of derknes, Cheif recounford after þe blak ny?t, To voide woful oute of her heuynes, Take nov goode hede, ladi &amp; goddesse, So þat my bil ?our grace may atteyne, Redresse to finde of þat I me compleyne. 3 For I am bounde to þing þat I nold; Freli to chese þere lak I liberte; And so I want of þat myn hert[e] would; The bodi [is] knyt, al þou?e my þou?t be fre, So þat I most, of necessite, Myn hertis lust out[e]ward contrarie; Thogh we be on, þe dede most[e] varie. 4 Mi worship sauf, I faile eleccioun, Again al ri?t, boþe of god and kynd, There to be knit vndir subieccion, Fro whens ferre are boþ[e] witte &amp; mynde; Mi þou?t goþe forþe, my bodi is behind: For I am here, and yonde my remembraunce; Atwixen two so hang I in balaunce. 5 Deuoide of ioie, of wo I haue plente; What I desire, þat mai I not possede; For þat I nold, is redi aye to me, And þat I loue, forto swe I drede, To my desire contrarie is my mede; And þus I stond, departid euen on tweyn, Of wille and dede Ilaced in a chaine. 6 For þou?e I brenne with feruence and with hete, Wiþ-in myn hert I mot complein of cold, And þuru? myn axcesse tho?e I sweltre and swete, Me to complein, god wot, I am not boold, Vnto no wi?t, nor a woord vnfold Of al my peyne, allas þe hard[e] stond!

And þerwithal, ful femynyne of drede, Me þou?te þis ladi sighen gan ful sore, And said again: ‘Ladi þat maist restore Hertes in Ioy from her aduersite, To do ?oure will de mieulx en mieulx magre.’ Thus euer sleping and dremyng as I lay, Within þe tempil me þou?t[e] þat I sey Gret pres of folk, with murmur wondirful, To croude and shove—þe tempil was so ful— Euerich ful bise in his owne cause, That I ne may shortli in a clause Descriuen al þe Rithes &amp; þe gise, And eke I want kunnyng to deuyse, Hou som þer were with blood, encense &amp; mylk, And som with floures sote &amp; soft as silk, And some with sparovis &amp; dovues faire &amp; white, That forto offerin gan hem to delite Vnto þe goddes, wiþ sigh &amp; with praier, Hem to relese of þat þai most desire; That for þe prese, shortli to conclude, I went my wai for þe multitude, Me to refressh oute of þe prese allone. And be my self me þou?t, as I gan gone Wiþ-in þe Estres &amp; gan awhile tarie, I saugh a man, þat welke al solitarie, That as me semed for heuines and dole Him to complein, þat he walk so sole, Wiþ-oute espiing of eni oþir wi?t. And if I shal descryuen him ari?t, Nere þat he hade ben in heuynes, Me þou?t he was, to speke of semelynes, Of shappe, of fourme, &amp; also of stature, The most passing þat euir ?it nature Made in hir werkis, &amp; like to ben a man; And þerwith-al, as I reherse can, Of face and chere þe most gracious, To be biloued, happi and Ewrous. But as it semed outward by his chere, That he compleyned for lak of his desire— For by himself, as he walk vp &amp; doune, I herd him make a lamentacioun, And seid: ‘Allas! what þing mai þis be, That nou am bound, þat whilom was so fre, And went at laarge, at myn eleccioun: Nou am I cau?t vnder subieccioun, Forto bicome a verre homagere To god o[f] loue, where þat, er I come here, Felt in myn hert ri?t nou?t of loues peine; But nov of nwe within his fire cheyne I am enbraced, so þat I mai not striue To loue and serue, whiles þat I am on lyue, The goodli fressh, in þe tempil yonder I saugh ri?t nov, þat I hade wonder, Hou euer god, forto reken all, My?t make a þing so celestial, So avngellike on erþe to appere. For wiþ þe stremes of hir eyen clere I am Iwoundid euen to þe hert, Þat fro þe deþ, I trow, I mai not stert. And most I mervaile þat so sodenli I was I?olde to bene at hir merci, Wherso hir list, to do me lyue or deie: Wiþ-oute more I most hir lust obeie And take mekeli my sodein auentur. For siþ my life, my deþ, and eke my cure Is in hir hond, it would[e] not auaile To gruch agein; for of þis bataile The palme is hires, &amp; pleinli þe victorie. If I rebelled, honour non ne glorie I my?t[e] not, in no wise, acheue. Siþ i am yold, hou shuld I þan preue To gif a werre—I wot it wil not be— Thou? I be loos, at laarge I mai not fle. O god of loue, hov sharp is nov þin arowe! Hou maist þou nov so cruelli &amp; narowe, With-oute cause, hurt[e] me and wound, And tast non he le, my soris forto sound! But lich a brid, þat fleith at hir desire, Til sodeinli within þe pantire She is Icau?t, þou? she were late at laarge— A nwe tempest for-casteþ now my baarge, Now vp nov dovne with wind it is so blowe, So am I possid and almost ouerþrowe, Fordriue in dirknes with many a sondri wawe. Alas! when shal þis tempest ouerdrawe, To clere þe skies of myn aduersite, The lode ster when I [ne] may not se, It is so hid with cloudes þat ben blake. Alas when wil þis turment ouershake? I can not wit, for who is hurt of nwe And blediþ in ward, til he wex pale of hwe, And haþ his wound vnwarli fressh &amp; grene, And is not kouþe vnto þe harmes kene Of my?ti Cupide, þat can so hertis davnte That no man may in your werre him vaunte To gete a pris, but oonli bi mekenes— For þere ne vaileþ strif ne sturdines— So mai I sain, þat with a loke am yold, And haue no power to stryue þou?e I would. Thus stand I euen bitwix life and deþ To loue &amp; serue, while þat I haue breþ, In such a place where I dar not pleyn, Lich him þat is in turment &amp; in pein, And knoweþ not, to whom forto discure; For þere þat I haue hoolly set my cure, I dar not wele, for drede &amp; for daunger, And for vnknowe, tellen hou þe fire Of louis brond is kindled in my brest. Thus am I murdrid &amp; slain at þe lest So preueli within myn [owne] þou?t. O ladi Venus, whom þat I haue sou?t, So wisse me now what me is best to do, Þat am distrau?t within my self[en] so, That I ne wot what way for [to] turne, Sauf be my self solein forto mourne, Hanging in balaunce bitwix hope &amp; drede, Withoute comfort, remedie or rede. For hope biddiþ pursue &amp; assay; And drede againward answeriþ &amp; saiþ nai; And now wiþ hope I am set on loft, But drede and daunger, hard &amp; noþing softe, Haue ouerþrowe my trust and put adoune; Nou at my laarge, nou feterid in prisone, Nov in turment, nov in souerein glorie, Nou in paradise &amp; nov in purgatorie, As man dispeired in a double were, Born vp wiþ hope, &amp; þan anon daunger Me drawiþ abak, and seith it shal not be. For where as I, of myn aduersite, Am bold somwhile merci to requere, Þan comeþ dispeire &amp; ginneþ me to lere A nwe lessoun, to hope ful contrare— Thei be so diuers þei would do me varie— And þus I stond dismaied in a traunce: For whan þat hope were likli me tauaunce, For drede I tremble and dar a woord not speke. And if it so be þat I not oute breke To tel þe harmes, þat greuen me so sore, But in myself encrese hem more &amp; more, And to be slain fulli me delite, Þen of my deþ sho is noþing to wite; For but if she my constreint pleinli knwe, Hou shuld she euer opon my paynis rwe! Thus oft[e] tyme with hope I am I-mevid To tel hir al of þat I am so greued, And to ben hardi on me forto take To axe merci; but drede þan doþ awake, And þurgh wanhope answeriþ me again, Þat bettir were, þen she haue disdeyne, To deie at onys, vnknow of eny wi?t. And þere-with[-al] bitt hope anon ry?t Me to be bold, to prayen hir of grace; For siþ al vertues be portreid in hir face, It were not sitting þat merci were bihind. And ri?t anone within my self I finde A nwe ple brou?t on me with drede, Þat me so maseþ þat I se no spede, Bicause he seith, þat stoneiþ al my bloode, I am so symple &amp; she is so goode. Thus hope and drede in me wil not ceasse To plete and stryue myn harmes to encrese. But at þe hardest ?it, or I be dede, Of my distresse siþ i can no rede, But stond[e] dovmb stil as eni stone, Tofore þe goddes I wil me hast anone, And complein withoute more sermon; Þou? deth be fin &amp; ful conclusioun Of my request, ?it I will assai.’ And ri?t anon me þou?[te] þat I say This woful man, as I haue memorie, Ful lowli entre into an oratorie, And knelid [a]doun in ful humble wise Tofore þe goddes, and gan anon deuyse His pitous quarel wiþ a doleful chere, Sayyng ri?t þus, anone as ?e shul here: 31 ‘Redresse of sorow, o Citheria, That wiþ þe stremes of þi plesaunt hete Gladest þe contre of [al] Cirrea, Where þou hast chosen þi paleis &amp; þi sete, Whos bri?t bemes ben wasshen and of[t] wete In the riuer of Elicon þe well: Haue nou pite of þat I shal here tell. 32 And not disdeyneþ of ?our benignite, Mi mortal wo, o ladi myn, goddes, Of grace &amp; bounte and merciful pite, Benig[ne]li to helpen and to redresse; And þou? so be I can not wele expresse The greuous harmes þat I fele in myn hert, Haueþ neuer þe les merci of my smert. 33 This is to sein: o clere heuens li?t, That next þe sonne cercled haue ?our spere, Siþ ?e me hurten wiþ ?our dredful my?t Bi influence of ?our bemys clere, And þat I bie ?our seruise nov sodere, As ?e me brou?t into þis maledie, Beþ gracious and shapeþ remedie. 34 For in ?ow hoolli liþ help of al þis case, And knowe best my sorow &amp; al my peyne: For drede of deþ hou I ne der, allas!

Nou wiþ ?oure fire hire hert[e] so restreyne, With-oute more, or I deie at þe lest, That she mai wete what is my requeste: 35 Hov I noþing in al þis world desire, But forto serue, fulli to myn ende, That goodli fressh, so womanli of chere, With-oute chaunge, while I haue life &amp; mynde; And þat ?e wold me such grace send Of my seruyse, þat she not disdeyne, Siþen hir to serue I may me not restreyne, 36 And siþ þat hope haþe ?eue me hardines To loue hir best and neuer to repent, Whiles þat I lyue, with al my bisenes To drede and serue, þou? daunger neuer assent. And hereopon ?e knowen myn entent, Hov I haue vowed fulli in my mynde To ben hir man, þou?

For wele I wot, in so heigh a place It wil not ben; þerfor I ouerpace, And take louli what wo þat I endure, Til she of pite me take vnto hir cure. 41 But oone avowe pleinli here I make, That wheþir so be she do me lyve or deye, I wil not grucch, but humble it take, And þank[e] god, &amp; wilfulli obey; For, be my trouth, myn hert shal not reneye, For life ne deþ, merci ne daunger, Of wil and þou?t to ben at hir desire, 42 To bene as trwe, as was Antonyus To Cleopatre, while him lasted breþe, Or vnto Tesbe ?ung[e] Piramus Was feiþful found, til hem departid deþe: Ri?t so shal I, til Antropos me sleiþe, For wele or wo, hir faithful man be found, Vnto my last, lich as myn hert is bounde, 43 To loue aswel as did Achilles Vnto his last þe faire Polixene, Or as þe gret famous Hercules, For Dianyre þat felt þe shottes kene— Ri?t so shal I, y sei ri?t as I mene, Whiles þat I lyve, hir boþe drede and serue, For lak of merci þou? she do me sterve. 44 Nou ladi Venus, to whom noþing vnknowe Is in þe world, I-hid ne not mai be— For þere nys þing, neþir heigh no lowe, Mai be concelid from ?our privete— Fro whom my menyng is not nov secre, But witen fulli þat myn entent is trwe, And lich my trowth nov on my peyn[e] rwe. 45 For more of grace þan presumpcioun I axe merci, and not of duete, Of louli humblesse, wiþoute offensioun, That ?e enclyne, of ?our benygnyte, Your audience to myn humylite, To graunt[e] me, þat to ?ov clepe &amp; calle, Somdai relese ?it of my paynes alle. 46 And siþ ?e haue þe guerdon &amp; þe mede Of al louers pleinli in ?our hond, Nou of [your] grace and pite takeþ hede Of my distresse, þat am vndir ?our bond So lovli bound, as ?e wele vndirstond: Nou in þat place, where I toke first my wound, Of pite sufferiþ my helth mai be found— 47 That lich as she me hurt[e] wiþ a si?te, Ri?t so with helpe let hir me sustene, And as þe stremes of hir ey?en bri?t Whilom myn hert, with woundis sharp &amp; kene, Thuru? perced haue, and ?it bene fressh &amp; grene: So as she me hurt, nou let hir me socoure, Or ellis certein I mai not long endure. 48 For lak of spech I can sey nov no more: I haue mater, but [I] can not plein; Mi wit is dulle to telle al my sore; A mouth I haue, &amp; ?it for al my peyne, For want of woordis I may not nov atteyne To tell[en] half þat doþ myn hert[e] greue, Merci abiding, til she me list releue. 49 But þis theffecte of my mater finalle: Wiþ deþ, or merci, reles forto finde. For hert, bodi, þought, life, lust and alle, Wiþ al my reson and alle my ful mynde, And fiue wittes, of oon assent I bind To hir seruice, wiþ-outen eny strife, And make hir princesse of my deþ or life. 50 And ?ov I prai of routh and eke pite, O goodli planet, o ladi Venus bri?t, That ?e ?oure sone of his deite— Cupid I mene, þat wiþ his dredful my?t And wiþ his brond, þat is so clere of li?te, Hir hert[e] so to fire and to mark, As ?e me whilom brent[e] with a spark: 51 That euenlich, and with þe same fire, She mai be het, as I nov brenne &amp; melt, So þat hir hert be flaumed bi desire, That she mai knowe bi feruence hou I swelt; For of pite pleinli if she felt The selfe hete þat doþ myn hert enbrace, I hope of rouþe she would do me grace.’ 52 And þerwithal Venus, as me þou?t, Toward þis man ful benyg[ne]li Gan cast hir ey?e, liche as þou? she rou?t Of his disease, and seid ful good[e]li: ‘Siþ it is so þat þou so humb[e]lie, Wiþ-oute grucchyng, oure hestis list obey, Toward þin help I wil anon puruey. 53 And eke my sone Cupide, þat is so blind, He shal ben helping, fulli to perfourme ?our hole desire, þat noþing behind Ne shal be left: so we shal refourme The pitous compleint, þat makiþ þe to mourne, That she for whom þou soroist most in hert, Shal þuru? hir merci relese al þi smert, 54 Whan she seþ tyme þuru? oure purueaunce.

Of him I had so gret compassioun, Forto reherse his weymentacioun, That, wel vnneþe þou? with my self I striue, I want connyng, his peynes to discryue. Allas! to whom shal I for help[e] cal?
