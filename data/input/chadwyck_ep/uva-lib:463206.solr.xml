      <field name="fulltext">To the right vvorshipfull Sir Owen Hopton Knight, the Queenes Maiesties Lieutenante of hir highnes Tower of London, Ber. Gar. Citizen of London wisheth health and increase of VVorship. [Leaue of to muse most gracious Prince of English soile] Leaue of to muse most gracious Prince of English soile, What sodaine-wight in Martiall wise approcheth neare: King Gurgunt I am hight, King Belins eldest sonne, Whose syre Dunwallo first, the Brittish crowne did weare. Whom truthlesse Gutlack forste to passe the surging seas, His falshode to reuenge, and Denmarke land to spoile. And finding in returne, this place a gallant vente, This Castle faire I built, a forte from foraine soile: To winne a Conquest, gets renowne and glorious name, To keepe and vse it well, deserues eternall fame. Wh? brute through cities, townes, the woods and dales did so?d Elizabeth this country peerelesse Queene drew neare: I was found out, my selfe in person noble Queene Did hast, before thy face in presence to appeare. Two thousand yeares welnye in silence lurking still: Heare, why to thee alone this seruice I do yelde. Besides that, at my Cities sute, their founder first Should gratulate most this ioyfull sight in open field. Foure speciall pointes and rare concurring in vs both This speciall seruice haue reseru'd to thee alone: The glory though of eche in thee doth farre surmount, Yet great with small comparde, will like appeare anone. When doubtfull warres the British princes long had wroong, My grandsire first vniting all did weare the Crowne. Of Yorke and Lancaster, who did conclude the broiles? Thy grandsire Henry seuenth, a king of great renowne. Myne vncle Brennus eke, my father ioyning handes, Olde Rome did raze, and sacke, and halfe consume with fire: Thy puissant father so, new Rome that purple whore Did sacke, and spoile hir neare of all hir glittering tire. Lo Cambridge scholes by myne assignment founded first, By thee my Cambridge scholes are famous through the world, I thirtie wandring ships of banisht men relieued. The thronges of banisht soules that in this Citie dwell, Do weepe for ioy, and pray for thee with teares vntold. In all these thinges thou noble Queene doest farre excell. But loe to thee I yeld as duety doth me binde In open field my selfe, my Citie, Castle, Key, Most happy fathers Kinges in such a daughter Queene, Most happy England were, if thou shouldest neuer die. Go on most noble Prince, for I must hast away, My Citie gates do long, their Soueraigne to receyue: More true thou neuer couldst, nor loyall subiects finde, VVhose hartes ful fast with perfect loue to thee do cleaue. The first Pageante was in Saint Stephens Parish in this manner. Most gracious prince, vndoubted soueraigne Queene, Our only ioy next God, and chiefe defence: In this small shewe, our whole estate is seene. The welth we haue, we finde proceede from thence, The idle hande hath here no place to feede, The painefull wight hath still to serue his neede. Againe, our seate denyes our traffique heere, The Sea too neare decydes vs from the rest, So weake we were within this dozen yeare, As care did quench the courage of the best: But good aduise, hath taught these little handes To rende in twayne the force of pining bandes. Pointing to the spinners.From Combed wool we drawe this slender threede, Pointing to the LoombesFrom thence the Loombes haue dealing with the same, And thence againe in order do proceede, Pointing to the vvorkes.These seueral workes, which skilful art doth frame: And all to driue Dame neede into hir caue, Our heades and hands togither labourde haue. VVe bought before the things that now we sel, These slender ympes, their workes do passe the waues, Gods peace and thine we holde and prosper well, Of euery mouth the hands the charges saues. Thus through thy helpe and ayde of power deuine, Doth Norvvich liue, whose harts and goods are thine. FINIS. B. G. The second Pageant. Whom Fame resounds with thundring Trump, which rends the ratling skeis, And pierceth to the hautie heauens, and thence descending flies Through flickering ayre: and so conioines the Sea and shoare togither, In admiration of thy grace, good Queene thart welcome hither, More welcome than Terpsicore, was to the town of Troy. Sea-faring men by Gemini conceiue not halfe my ioy: Strong Hercules to Theseus was neuer such delight Nor Nisus to Euriclus as I haue in this sight, Penelope did neuer thirst Vlisses more to see Than I poore Norwich hungred haue to gaine the sight of thee. And now that these my happy eyes beholde thy heauenly face, The Lord of Lordes I humbly pray, to blisse thy noble grace VVith Næstors life, with Sibilles helth, with Cræsus stock and store, VVith all good giftes of Salomon, and twice as many more. VVhat should I say? thou art my ioy next God, I haue none other, My princesse and my peerlesse Queene, my louing nurse and mother. My goods and lands, my hands and hart, my limbes and life are thine, VVhat is mine owne in right or thought, to thee I do resigne. Graunt then (oh gracious soueraigne Queene) this only my request, That that which shal be done in me, be construed to the best. And take in part my slender shewes, wherin my whole pretence Is for to please you Maiestie, and end without offence. So shall I clap my hands for ioy, and hold my selfe as rich As if I had the golde of Inde, and double twice as much. FINIS. B. G. Then spake Debora. VVhere princes sitting in their thrones set god before their sight And liue according to his lawe, and guide their people right, There doth his blessed giftes abounde, there kingdomes firmely stand There force of foes cannot preuayle, nor furie fret the lande. My selfe (oh peerlesse Prince) do speake by proofe of matter past, VVhich proofe by practise I perfourmde, and foylde his foes at last. For Iabin king of Canaan, poore Israel did spight, And ment by force of furious rage to ouerrun vs quite. Nyne hundred Iron Chariots, he brought into the field. VVith cruell captaine Sisera by force to make vs yeelde. His force was great, his fraude was more, he fought, we did defende, And twenty winters long did last this warre without an end. But he that neyther sleepes nor slackes such furies to correct, Appointed me Debora for the iudge of his elect: And did deliuer Sisera into a womans hande. I slewe them all, and so in rest his people helde the lande. So mightie prince, that puisaunt Lord, hath plaste thee here to be, The rule of this triumphant Realme alone belongth to thee. Continue as thou hast begon, weede out the wicked route, Vpholde the simple, meeke and good, pull downe the proud &amp; stoute. Thus shalt thou liue and raigne in rest, and mightie God shalt please. Thy state be sure, thy subiectes safe, thy common welth at ease. Thy God shal graunt thee length of life, to glorify his name, Thy deedes shall be recorded, in the booke of lasting fame. B. G. FINIS. Then spake Judeth. Oh floure of Grace, oh prime of Gods elect, Oh mighty Queene and finger of the Lord, Did God sometime by me poore wight correct. The Champion stoute that him and his abhord? Then be thou sure thou art his mighty hand, To conquere those which him and thee withstand. The rage of foes Bethulia did besiege, The people faint were redy for to yeeld: God ayded me poore widow nerethelesse, To enter into Holofernes field, And with this sword by his directing hand, To slay his foe, and quiet so the land. If this his grace were giuen to me poore wight, If widowes hand could vanquish such a foe: Then to a Prince of thy surpassing might. VVhat Tirant liues but thou mayest ouerthrow. Perseuer then his seruant as thou art, And hold for aye a noble victors part. Finis B. G. Then Hester spake. The fretting heads of furious foes haue skill, As well by fraude as force to finde their pray: In smiling lookes doth lurke a lot as ill, As where both sterne and sturdy streames do sway, Thy selfe oh Queene, a proofe hath seene of this, So well as I poore Esther haue iwis. As Iabins force did Israel perplex, And Holofernes fierce Bethuliel besiege, So Hamons slights sought me and mine to vex, Yet shewde a face a subiect to his liege. But Force nor Fraude, nor Tyrant strong can trap, Those whiche the Lorde in his defence doth wrap. The proofes I speake by vs haue erst bin seene, The proofes I speake, to thee are not vnknowen. Thy God thou knowest most dread and soueraigne Queen, A world of foes of thine hath ouerthrowen, And hither nowe triumphantly doth call Thy noble Grace, the comforte of vs al. Doste thou not see the ioy of all this flocke? Vouchsafe to viewe their passing gladsome cheare, Be still (good Queene) their refuge and their rocke, As they are thine to serue in loue and feare: So Fraude, nor Force, nor foraine Foe may stand Againste the strength of thy moste puyssaunt hand. FINIS. B. G. Then spake Martia. VVith long discourse (oh puissant Prince) some tract of time we spend, Vouchesafe yet nowe a little more, and then we make an ende. The thundring blaste of Fame, whereof Dame Norwich first did speake, Not only shooke the aire and skies, but all the earth did breake, It rend vp graues, and bodies raisde, eche spirite tooke his place, And this alonely worde was hearde: Here comth the pearle of Grace, Here commes the Iewell of the worlde, hir peoples whole delight, The Paragon of present time, and Prince of Earthly Might. The voice was strange, the wonder more: For when we viewde the Earth Eche Prince that erst had raigned here, receyvde againe his breath, And with his breath, a libertie to holde againe his place, If any one amongest vs all exceede your noble Grace. Some comforte euery one conceyued to catche againe his owne, His vtmost skill was trimly vsde, to haue his vertues knowne. The playes surpasse my skill to tell, but when eche one had sayde, Apollo did himselfe appeare and made vs all dismayed. VVil you contende with hir (quoth he,) within whose sacred breast Dame Pallas and my selfe haue framde our soueraigne seate of rest? VVhose skill directs the Muses nine, whose grace doth Venus staine: Hir eloquence like Mercurie: Like Iuno in hir traine? VVhose God is that eternall Ioue which holds vs al in awe? Beleeue me, you exceede the bounds of equitie and lawe. Therewith they shronk themselues aside, not one I coulde espie, They coutcht them in their caues agayne and there ful quiet lye, Yet I that Martia hight, whiche sometime rulde this land, As Queene for thirtie three yeares space, gate licence at his hande, And so Gurguntius did, my husbands father deare, VVhiche built this Towne and Castle both, to make oure homage here, VVhiche homage mightie Queene accept: The Realme and right is thine: The Crowne, the Scepter, and the sworde to thee we do resigne. And wishe to God, that thou mayste raigne, twice Nestors yeares in peace, Triumphing ouer all thy foes, to all our Ioyes encreace. Amen. FINIS. B. G. [From slumber softe I fell a sleepe] From slumber softe I fell a sleepe, From slepe to dreame, from dreame to depe delight, Eche Iem the Gods had giuen the world to keepe In Princely wise came present to my sight: Suche solace then did sincke into my minde, As mortall man on molde coulde neuer finde. The Gods did striue, and yet their striues were sweete, Ech one woulde haue a Vertue of hir own, Dame Iuno thought the highest place moste meete For hir, bicause of riches was hir throne. Dame Venus thought by reason of hir loue That she might claime the highest place aboue. The Virgins state Diana still did prayse, And Ceres praysde the fruite of fertile soyle: And Prvdence did dame Pallas chiefly rayse, Minerva all for eloquence did striue, They smylde to see their quarelling estate, And Iove himselfe decided their debate. My sweetes (? he) leaue of your sugred strife, In equall place I haue assignde you all: A soueraigne wight there is that beareth life, In whose sweete hart I haue inclosde you all. Of England soyle she is the soueraigne Queene, Your vigors there do florish fresh and greene. They skipt for ioy and gaue their franke consent, The noyse resounded to the hawtie skie: With one lowd voyce they cryed al, content, They clapt their handes, and therewith waked I. The world and they concluded with a breath, And wisht long raigne to Queene Elizabeth. Finis B. G. [Feare not oh Queene, thou arte beloued so] Then marched they aboute agayne, and that done, Iupiter spake to the Queene in this sorte, and then gaue her a ryding Wande of Whales fin curiously wrought. Feare not oh Queene, thou arte beloued so, As Subiectes true, will truely thee defende: Feare not my power to ouerthrow thy wo, I am the God that can eche misse amende. Thou doest know, great Ivpiter am I, That gaue thee fyrst thy happy Soueraigntie. I giue thee still, as euer thou haste had, A peerelesse power, vnto thy dying daye: I giue thee rule to ouercome the bad, And loue, to loue thy louing Subiectes aye. I giue thee heere this small and slender wande, To shew, thou shalt in quyet rule the Lande. Then Iuno spake, whose gift was a Purse curyously wrought. Is Ivno rich? no sure she is not so She wantes that wealth, that is not wanting heere, Thy good gets thee friendes, my welth wins many a foe, My riches rustes, thyne shyne passing cleere. Thou art beloued of Subiectes farre and nye, Which is such wealth as money cannot bye. Farewell fayre Queene, I cannot giue thee aught, Nor take away thy good that is so bound: Thou canst not giue, that I so long haue sought, Ne can I hold the riches thou hast found, Yet take this gifte, though poore I seeme to be, That thou thy selfe shalt neuer poorer be. Then after they had marched agayne about, Mars gaue his gift, which was a fayre payre of Knyues, and sayd. VVhere force doth fiercely seeke to foster wrong, There Mars doth make him make a quick recoyle, Nor can indure that he should harbour long, Where naughty wights manure in goodly soyle. This is the vse that aydes the force of Warre, That Mars doth mend, that force doth seeke to marre. And though oh Queene thou beest a Prince of peace, Yet shalt thou haue me fastly sure at neede: The stormes of stryfe, and blustering broyles to cease, Which forraigne foes, or faythlesse friendes may breede. To conquer, kill, to vanquish and subdue, Such fayned folke, as loues to liue vntrue. These wordes were grauen on those Knyues. To hurt your foe, and helpe your friend, These Knyues are made vnto that end. Both blunt and sharpe you shall vs fynde, As pleaseth best your Princely mynde. Then spake Venus, whose gift was a whyte Doue. In vayne (fayre Queene) from Heauen my comming was, To seeke tamend that is no way amis: For now I see thy fauour so doth passe, That none but thou, thou onely she it is, Whose bewty bids ech wight to looke on thee, By view they may an other Venvs see. Where bewty boastes, and fauour doth not fayle, What may I giue to thee O worthy wight? This is my gift, there shall no woe preuayle, That seekes thy will, agaynst thy willes delight, Not where they will, but where it likes thy minde, Accept that friend, if loyall thou him finde. The Doue being caste off, ranne directly to the Queene, and being taken vppe and set vppon the Table before hir Maiestie, sate so quietly, as if it had bin tied. Then after they had marched again about Apollo pres?ted his gift, which was, an Instrument called a Bandonet, and did sing to the saide Instrument this Dittie, as he played. It seemeth straunge to see such strangers here, Yet not so straunge, but straungers knows you well: Your vertuous thoughts to Gods do plaine appeare, Your acts on earth bewraies how you excell: You cannot die, Loue here hath made your lease, Whiche Gods haue sent, and God sayeth shal not cease. Vertuous desire desired me to sing, No Subiects sute, thoughe suters they were all, Apollos gifts are subiects to no King, Rare are thy gifts, that did Apollo call, Then still reioyce, sithens God and Man say so, This is my gift, thou neuer shalt haue woe. Pallas then speaketh, and presenteth hir gifte, whiche was a Booke of Wisedome. Most worthy wight, what wouldste thou haue of me? Thou haste so muche, thou canste enioy no more: I cannot giue, that once I gaue to thee, Nor take away thy good I gaue before. I robbed was by Natures good consent Againste my will, and yet I was content. A Pallas thou, a Princesse I will be: I Queene of losse, thou Goddesse whiche haste got: I sometime was, thou onely now arte she, I take, thou gauest that lucke that was my lot, I giue not thee this Booke to learne thee aught, For that I knowe already thou arte taught. Then after they had marched againe about, Neptvne did speake: his gifte was, a great Artificiall Fishe, and in the belly thereof a noble Pike, which he threwe out before hir Maiestie. What arte thou (Queene) that Gods do loue thee so? Who woon their willes to be so at thy will? How can the worlde become thy cruell foe? How can Disdaine or Mallice seeke to kill? Can Sea or Earth deuise to hurte thy hap, Since thou by Gods doest sit in Fortunes lap. As Heauen and Earth haue vowed to be thine, So Neptvnes Seas haue sworne to drench thy foes, As I am God, and all the waters mine, Still shalte thou get, but neuer shalt thou lose: And since on Earth my wealth is nought at all, Accept good will, the gifte is verye small. Diana presented a Bowe and Arrowes nocked and headed with siluer. Hir speache was thys. Who euer found on Earth a constant friend, That may compare wyth this my Virgin Queene? Who euer found a body and a mynde So free from staine, so perfect to be seene, Oh Heauenly hewe, that aptest is to soile, And yet doste liue from blot of any foyle Rare is thy gifte; and giuen to fewe or none, Malist therefore of some that dare not saye, More shines thy light, for that I know but one, That any suche shew, to followe on their way. Thou thou arte shee, take thou the onely praise, For chastest Dame in these oure happy daies: Accept my Bowe, since beste thou dost deserue, Thoughe well I knowe thy mynde can thee preserue. Cupido his speeche, his gift an Arrow of Golde. Ah ha, I see my mother out of sight, Then let the boy nowe play the wag a while, I seeme but weake, yet weake is not my might, My boyishe wit can oldest folke beguile. Who so doth thinke, I speake this but in iest, Let me but shoote, and I shall quench his reste, Marke here my shafts: This all is made of woodde, Whiche is but softe, and breedes but softe goodwill. Nowe this is guilte, yet seemes it golde full good, And doth deceiue blinde louing people still. But here is one is seldome felte or seene: This is of Golde, meete for the noblest Queene. Wherefore Dame faire, take thou this gifte of me, Thoughe some deserue, yet none deserue like you, Shoote but this shafte at King or Cæsar: He, And he is thine, and if thou wilte allowe. It is a gifte, that many here woulde craue, Yet none, but thou, this golden Shafte maye haue. There was written vppon the shafte. My Coulour Ioy, my Substaunce Pure, My Vertue suche as shall endure. Goldingham. FINIS. [Terrestriall Ioyes are tied with sclender file] Terrestriall Ioyes are tied with sclender file, Eche happy hap full hastily doth slyde, As Sommer season lasteth but a while, So Winter stormes do longer time abide: Alas what blisse can any time endure? Our Sunshine day is dashte with sodaine shoure. Coulde tongue expresse our secreate ioyes of hart, (Oh mighty Prince) when thou didst come in place? No no God wot, nor can expresse the smarte Thy Subiectes feele in this departing case. But gratious Queene, let here thy Grace remaine In gratious wise, till thy returne againe. In lieu whereof, receiue thy Subiects heartes, In fixed Faith continually thine owne: Who ready rest to lose their vitall parts In thy defence, when any blaste is blowne. Thou arte oure Queene, oure rocke and onely stay, We are thine owne to serue by night and day. Farewell oh Queene, farewell oh Mother deere, Let Iacobs God thy sacred body guarde: All is thine owne that is possessed here, And all in all is but a small rewarde For thy greate grace, God length thy life like Noe, To gouerne vs, and eke thy Realme in Ioy. Amen. FINIS. B. G. and spoken by himselfe, to whome hir Maiestie saide: VVe thanke you hartily. [VVhat vayleth life, where sorrowe soakes the harte?] Then with the Musicke in the same place was song this shorte Dittie following, in a very sweete voice. VVhat vayleth life, where sorrowe soakes the harte? Who feareth Death that is in deepe distresse? Release of life doth best abate the smarte Of him, whose woes are quite without redresse. Lend me your teares, resigne your sighes to me, Helpe all to waile the dolor whych you see. What haue wee done, shee will no longer stay? What may we do to holde hir with vs still? Shee is oure Queene, wee subiectes muste obey. Graunt, though with griefe to hir departing will. Conclude wee then, and sing with sobbing breath, God length thy life, (oh Queene Elizabeth.) FINIS. B. G. To the Sunne couered with cloudes, vpon Monday, being the .18. of August. 1578. In shadowing cloudes why art thou closd? ô Phœbus bright retire: Vnspoused Pallas present is, ô Phœbus bright retire. The threatning speare is floong farre off, doubt not grim Gorgons ire: Vnarmed Pallas present is, ô Phœbus bright retire. Perhaps thou art afrayd: And why? at this so large a light: Least that a VVoman should excell, thy beames (ô Phœbus) bright. Let not a Queene, a Virgine pure, which is, and euer was, O faire Apollo, make thee blush: you both in beautie passe. O Phœbus safe and sound returne, which, banishing the night, Bringst backe the day: in all the world nothing of like delight. She, only she, the darkenesse draue of Poprye quite away: And, by Religion, hath restord the bright and lightsome day. O Phœbus, with thy beames, which foylst the cloudes both blinde and blacke, The world, in manner all, a thing of like delight doth lacke. A thousand daungers and delayes, the Papistes had deuisde, To thende our Princesse should abridge, hir progresse entreprisde: Yet this our bright and shining sunne, cast light through euery cloud: Although in cloudes thou art content, Apollo, oft to shroude. Thou seest our Sunne in comely course, cuttes off eache stop &amp; stay: Do thou the like, and by thy light driue euery cloude away. In shadowing cloudes why art thou closd? ô Phœbus bright retyre: Vnspoused Pallas present is: ô Phœbus bright retyre. By the same. Hir kingdome all by prouidence, Queene Iuno doth vphold: And of Minerua Lady learnd, is learned lore extold: And Venus fayre of countenance, hath beautie vncontrold. These sundry giftes of Goddesses three, Elizabeth possesseth: By prouidence hir peoples peace, and comfort she increaseth: Hir learning, learning amplifies: hir beautie neuer ceasseth. I did but ieast, of Goddesses to giue them three the name: This Lady mayst thou Goddesse call, for she deserues the same: Although she will not vndertake, a title of such fame.</field>
