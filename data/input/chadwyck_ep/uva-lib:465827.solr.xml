      <field name="fulltext">To Monsieur Lewis Pieron, at Thoulon. Paris April 20. 1701: The Husband-man and his Sons: A FABLE. A father (like a Father) to secure His Family, by an United Pow'r, By Demonstration plain thought fit to show, What mighty Strength from Pow'rs United flow. His Sons were to this purpose bid appear, And to their Father carefully give ear: Of Wands a bundle, in a Band inclos'd, He there had lay'd, and to each one propos'd, The close ty'd Wands to break; which each in vain Attempted to effect:— Th'Instructing Father did untwist the Band, And gave to every Son a single Wand, With order each on that his strength to try; Which each did break with great facility. Thus, says the Father, you do plainly see, Tho' Passive things be Weak to low degree, Yet are of Strength, when join'd in Unity. So Sons, whilst in firm Friendship ye remain, Your Enemies Attempts will be in vain; But if Divided, easily you'll be, A Prey to each Ambitious Enemy. Reflection. If England, Holland, and their Friends conjoin, By Force they may oppose the French Design; But if mistaken Politicks do move A Fatal Separation, (such 'twill prove) Nought can preserve them, but the Pow'r above. Agreement Centers several in one, And Formidable make those which alone, Are not of pow'r fit to resist a Foe, But if conjoin'd, to mighty force they grow. If fear of present ill makes One comply, He may expect Ulysses Fate, to Die Last, and be swallow'd in his Monarchy. The Doves and Kite: A FABLE. After long War between the Doves and Kite, Wherein the Doves were Conquer'd by his Might, And lost a pretious Life at ev'ry Fight; A Peace concluded was; and to secure, That Peace 'twixt Kite and Doves might still endure; They chose his Young Grand-Chick to be their King, Hoping to rest secure beneath his Wing; Judging Relation mightily would move The Grandsire Kite with them to Live in Love. But still the Rav'nous Nature of the Bird, To Doves a Foe, would little Peace afford; Under Pretence of acting for his Young, He had a Plausible Pretence for Wrong; Acted what e'er he Pleas'd, King gave Consent, Tho' kill'd his Subject Doves in Merriment: Too late alas, the Doves did then Complain, A growing Kite, and Grandsire Kite they'd ta'en. Reflection. Two Kingdoms have for Years Contesting been, And ev'ry Summer shown a Bloody Scene; Spain, altho' help'd by Neighbours, did Decrease; But farther lost it self, by making Peace; Since it hath ta'en a Grandson for its King, Who leaves the Grandsire all the managing Of his Tame Subjects, who for fear Obey; So like the Kite, he'll absolutely sway. The Frogs and their King, A FABLE. The Frogs (like Men) uneasie in their Fate, Desir'd a Change, so Jove did supplicate, To grant to them a King, that they might be Rul'd, like their Neighbours, in a Monarchy. The condescending God did grant their Pray'r, And dub'd a Log their King; they strait prepare, Awful respect to pay to their new King, That was a Quiet and Unthinking Thing; And let his Subjects do what e'er they wou'd, Croak when they pleas'd, at pleasure swam the Flood. Yet not content, tho' Will to them was Law, They Scoft that King that had not Skill to Awe. Dissatisfy'd, they Pray'd to Jove again, That he would give a War-like King to Reign: That he, by's Power, from Foes might them Defend; And Lead their Armies, when they would Offend. Jove, in compliance, sent the Crane to Rule, Who soon devour'd his Subjects of the Pool; Spar'd neither Age, nor Sex, that he could find, But to each Subject was alike Unkind. In vain they Grieve, in vain they Curse his Pow'r, That hath both Force and Humour to Devour. Reflection. The Spanish Monarchy was Lazy grown, And had a Log-like K? to fill the Throne Unfit for Council, and for Action too, ('Tis bad when one can neither Say nor Do.) This being their Fate, some few Designing Peers, Acted the Monarchs part for many Years: Did, and Undid what ever they thought fit, The Monarchs Sense would never question it: His easie Temper made his Subjects be Saucy, Contemptuous of his Dignity. He, King in Sine Cure, did ne'er Command, The Manage of his large extending Land. So slighted for his Weakness, they desir'd A Change, and a new King of Jove requir'd, That with Wise Conduct might theis Armies Lead; And shew himself an active worthy Head. Whether by Fates Decree, or from their Pray'r, Their King is Dead, and they have made an Heir, Him to Succeed, which like the Crane may prove Rav'nous, Destructive, wheresoe'er he move: The Callow Bird, weak and not Fledg'd by Age, As yet, himself expresses little Rage; But has to Grandsire Crane given the Pow'r To Rule at Will; to Save, or to Devour: And fam'd throughout the World, his temper's known, Cruel to Strangers, Barb'rous to his Own. The Dog and Shadow. A FABLE. A dog (whose rav'nous Stomach made him roam, Unsatisfy'd with what he had at home) Pilfer'd abroad what Bounty did not grant, To gratify his Av'rice, not his Want: Once on a time, when Plenty Crown'd the Board, With all the Gusts Variety afford, He Bones receiv'd well Flesh'd, like Navy-Fees, Enough the greedy Cerberus to please: But more his Rav'nous Humour did require, To satisfie his Gluttonous desire. So from his careless Neighbours he would Steal, Or from the Weak, by Force would take a Meal; Which happen'd once to be a piece of Meat, A Luscious Bit; design'd for future Treat; With which, in haste, he plung'd the neighb'ring Flood, To keep possession of his late stol'n Food. But as he swam, the mimick Shade deceiv'd Unreasoning Thought, that Substance it believ'd. Strong was Desire the fancy'd Piece to gain; So swiftly mov'd his Legs, but all in vain: At equal distance he the Shade pursu'd, Seem'd tyred now, and then the Chase renew'd. The last effort to gain his end he made, And gaping jumpt to snap the flitting shade: His Mouth once open, Meat and Shade were lost, His Substance gone, his future Hopes were crost. Then he his Greedy Temper 'gan to Blame, That equally had caus'd his Want and Shame. Reflection. A Neighb'ring Monarch, unto whom kind Heaven Has mighty Treasures, and vast Kingdoms given, Blest with long Life, which he in Health Enjoys, And sees a long Posterity of Boys; Yet not Content, his Av'rice makes him Roam, (Stol'n Goods are Sweet, tho' better are at home) In quest of Countries that Unguarded lie, Depending upon League's Security; Or else in search for those whose humble Fate, Must be crush'd down beneath his Army's Weight. Some such h'has found, and took them as his own; From Fraud or Force his Titles most are grown; His Mind, insatiate still, does Covet more; His Hands, tho' full, grasp at a larger Store; No sooner does the shadow of a Crown, Or Glimps of Hope to fill an empty Throne, Appear, but all his Art and Force he'll bend, To gain that Crown, that empty Throne t'ascend. But may his Fancy, like the Dogs, be Crost, His Hopes, and his Possession quite be Lost: And may that Monarch whilst he Covets more, Be Dog-like serv'd, lose what he'd Stole before. The Oak and the Elm. A FABLE. An Elm, a Fav'rite to a Royal Oak, Thought by Pernitious Council, to provoke His Prince to Ire against some humble Trees, That round about him stood, as Guards to Majestie; Advis'd the Extirpation of those Friends, That he without Controul might gain his ends, And often importun'd the Prudent Prince, That he those Shrubs would far remove from thence. Many forc'd Arguments he us'd in Vain; Of friv'lous Acts, as mighty Crimes, Complain; But yet his Suit he never could obtain. The Oak concern'd his Stories still to hear, No longer could the Sycophant forbear; But told him plainly, That he did advise, To move his Friends, that to his Enemies He Naked and Defenceless might appear, And the whole shock of ev'ry blast might bear: Threat'ned Destruction, if again he mov'd Ought to the prejudice of those he Lov'd. Thus was the Guilty Elm from favour thrown, And Friends amongst the Shrubs he could find none. Reflection. Flatt'ry's the Seed from which most Fav'rites spring, Some few from worth their Pedigree do bring; But those like useful Props support a State, And t'other's Vices do it Ruinate; Both, by their Counsels, Act their Country's Fate. Since what the Fav'rites say, is soon believ'd, By them are Kings the easiest Deceiv'd; The Deeds of all, just as they Please, they Paint; They make a Man a Devil, or a Saint: Say, Vices Vertues are; what's Good call Bad, The stamp for either's by the Fav'rite made. From Presence of a King, they'd oft remove All Men of Merit, that they do not Love: But Prudent Princes question well, and try Of each Report, the Cause and Verity, Before they Judgment Pass, least they should hear A diff'rent Tale, from what did first appear; If by a false Report at Men they Aim, Prudent, and Loyal, of Unspotted Fame: A Prince to such ought his Displeasure shew, And give the Villains Death, if't be their due. The Bull and Lyon. A FABLE. A lyon oft a mighty Bull assail'd By sundry slights, yet of his purpose fail'd; Then under Friendships Notion, did Invite The Bull to take Collate with him one Night; Told him he had a Sheep already Drest; To which Dear Friend should be a welcome Guest. The Bull agreed, and follow'd to his Den Aloof behind, but soon return'd again, Frighted by Objects that appear'd in view, As mighty Spit, and mighty Caldron too, Fitter to Roast or Boil an Ox than Ewe. Reflection. Oft have the French Attempted, tho' in Vain, A Pow'r o'er Holland, and it's Friends to gain; But Stratagems, and Pow'r, of Men, and Sense, Hath kept them watchful in their own Defence; And hath not yet intrapt their Innocence. Failing in these, New methods France does take, And under Friendships smiles does hide its hate; Thinking that way he may Inslave their State. Invites them to the pleasant Banquet Peace, Where the Fatigu'd Warriour is Crown'd with Ease. From such Pretences, who could ever think Of other Weapons, but a Pen and Ink, A lasting League to make? Instead of that, Nought but the Cannon, and the Drum do Prate. The Enamour'd Lyon. A FABLE. Once on a time, a Lyon much in Love With a fair Damsel, did her Father move To grant his Virgin Daughter for his Bride, (For Her he slighted all the World beside,) Promis'd a Loving, and a Peacefull Life, If he'd but give this Darling for a Wife. The Father Frighted at his strange Demand, Thought of his Power, if by Consent he Reign'd, O'er one so near ally'd, his House Divide, And make a party able to Decide In his own Favour; scruples about Right, Or what he'd make such to increase his might; Refuse Consent his Daughter for to give To one so Arm'd with Claws and Teeth to Live. Jove's not (much less the Lyon) wise in Love; So would all Obstacles of fear remove: His Teeth were drawn, his Nails were all close pair'd, (Which his strong Passion mightily Declar'd) But when these Condescending Acts were done, The Man refus'd the Lyon for his Son, Reflection. There is an Heiress Crown unmarried yet, Unless force makes Wedlock Legitimate, Whom an Old Monarch for his Grandson Woes, And all her Neighbouring Friends for License sues, For Peaceful Life he'll promise mighty things; But for performance he no Surety brings: Would be as Pledges for his Sacred word, The full Possession of some Towns afford, It would be of his Truth a new Record. When he'll to's injur'd Neighbours Justice do And honestly his home Concerns Pursue; A wonder will be seen, that he proves true. But if his Nails were Pair'd, and Teeth were gone, She were no fitting Match for his Grandson Unless the Neighbours all wou'd be Undone. A Fowler and Black-Bird. A FABLE. Near a Young Copse, his Nett a Fowler spread, And the same Place with Chaff had covered; To whom a Black-Bird said, What is't you do? And what's the reason you Walk to and fro? The Fowler told him, In that spacious Field, He Measures took a City for to Build; And then retir'd to watch the silly Bird, Who thought Man scorn'd to Falsify his Word; Flew down to View the Place, or else to Feed, But by the Net his Liberty's Betray'd. Reflection. When Men a mighty Mischief have in hand, As gloss for Roguery, Goodness they pretend. Under pretence of saving of a Town, A Neighb'ring Prince, with Forces of his own, Will take Possession for a Neighb'ring Crown; But Rules with Pow'r the much Mistaken Men, And seldom grants their Liberty again. Let Foes in Power Promise what they will That kindly looks, Self must be Guarded still. The Dragon, the Countryman, and the Fox. A FABLE. The Dragon, carry'd by a sudden flow Of Waters, to a Place he did not know, Was by their sudden fall left on the Land, Far from the River, on the Parched Sand; Distress'd he was, scarce hoping for Relief; His Fate was almost finish'd by his Grief. When to his searching Eyes a Man appear'd Leading an Ass, his drooping Fancy chear'd; He beg'd the Man would kind assistance give, That by his Mercy he might longer Live: Distress'd for help he Promis'd mighty things, Gold enough to support the Pomp of Kings; Which welcome Promise, made the Man believe, He might at that time both their wants Relieve, Himself from want of Riches, th'other Food; So was resolv'd to help him to the Flood. Which to effect, he straight the Dragon ty'd, And on his Asses Saddle let him Ride; To his known quarters he did him Convey; Gently Unty'd him, 'fore he ask'd for Pay. But when the Dragon Liberty had gain'd, Forgot the Kindness, and his Friend disdain'd; Ask'd him in Angry Tone, if he deserv'd For binding him with Cords, a Gold Reward? Bid him cease his impert'nence, and be gone, Or for his Crime his Body shou'd Attone: Whilst they Disputed, an old Fox came by, Offer'd himself as Judge, their Case to try; To which consenting, each did tell his Tale, And by his Arguments try'd to prevail, That Sentence in his favour might be pass'd.— The Dragon he alledged the Man him ty'd, And made him on his Asses Back to Ride, And several Affronts offer'd beside. Defendant then reply'd, I found th'ingrate In a dry place, ready to Suffocate; Who Pray'd me out of Pity, for to bring Him to his Home, or to some other Spring; And largely promis'd Gold should be my hire: But now he Threatens Death, if Gold require. The Judge had heard the Partys Pro and Con, And found the Dragon culpable alone, But dare not for his Life, pronounce his Fate Whilst he was Loose; so like a Magistrate, Order'd the Dragon to be bound again, That justly he might Judge the Cruel Pain The Saucy Man had made him long endure, For which, of Recompence he should be sure. The Man the Dragon then did loosely bind, Not hurting him, his Limbs were scarce confin'd: Did he, said th'Fox, Bind you so hard before? O ten times worse, (Sir Judge) he made me Sore. Then draw the Knots streighter, that I may see The very utmost of his Cruelty. Th'Countryman stronger pull'd with all his Force, And the by-standing Judge felt no Remorse; But ask'd him if the Man had so hard Ty'd? The Dragon Groaning, Yes indeed, reply'd; You'r so fast Bound, you have not Pow'r to Stir? Not any, says the Dragon, But kind Sir, Let me be streight Unloos'd.— No, says the Fox, I'll now your Sentence pass, That he again shall lay you on his Ass, And leave you in the Place, and Grief you was. Reflection.
