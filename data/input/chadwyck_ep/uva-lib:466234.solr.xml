Harold. Sigurd (his Companion) Leofric (his Companion) Frioth (his Companion) Rolf (his Foster-brother). Sir Hugo. The Lady Isabelle. Thordisa. Gerda (her Attendant). The White Pilgrim. ACT I. Scene.—Exterior of Harold's Castle in Finland. The windows of the Banquet-hall of the Castle and a flight of steps leading into the interior are to the left of the scene; to the right, an old Gothic arch, leading to a Chapel beyond. Along the back of the scene runs a turreted walk, overlooking the sea below, which, with a mountainous coast, forms the background. In its centre a rough cairn of stone. Evening. (As the Curtain rises, Gerda is discovered watching by the Gothic arch. A psalm is heard from the Chapel.) I. Lord of the life that is born of the grave, Merciful Spirit, hear us and save! Shield us from evil, guard us from wrong, Through the dull sleep of life bear us along; Wake us at last with the fair and the brave: Merciful Spirit, hear us and save! II. SONG FROM THE BANQUET HALL. Ha, ha, ha! the rich wine flashes Ruby red: There's no heat in dead men's ashes; They are dead. Just awhile, for love and laughter, Lasts the light; Seize the day! what follows after, Is—the night! III. PSALM. Show us the right way, oh, teach us the true! Merciful Spirit, make us anew! Raise us to follow, guide us to tread, Where to the one goal Thy footsteps have led; Help us the ill we have done to undo; Merciful Spirit, make us anew! IV. SONG. Ha, ha, ha! the grass grows keenly From the tomb; And the night winds whistle keenly Through the gloom. Deep our draught, our slumber deep is; Let us fill To the dead, whose sober sleep is Deeper still! Enter Rolf from the Castle, looking back. Rolf. Ay, drink away; there were more space for brains, Were there less room for liquor, in some heads. (Seeing Gerda.) But soft! what vision breaks upon my path? Gerda, my pretty Gerda! Ger. Not so fast! Gerda I am, and pretty, but not yours. Rolf. I took you for an angel. Ger. So I am; Or so you used to say. Rolf. Yes, so I did, And so I do, and so I always will, Till better knowledge kill the simile. Ger. Then shall that better knowledge never be. I'll moult no feather of my angel-wing For such a faithless worshipper as you. Rolf. Faithless! Ger. Ay, faithless! faithless as your lord To my dear mistress; faithless as all men Are to all women. Oh, we know you, sir, And all the doings of your wicked crew; That villainous old Sigurd and the rest; Sigurd the hunchback—Sigurd, the arch-fiend, In the disguise of some malicious ape! Sigurd, who makes of Harold what he pleases! The savage foe of the pure faith that dawns In morning splendour o'er our darkened land. Rolf. Not so; when Sigurd would have driven out The band of Christian zealots that do hold Their meetings in the ruined chapel there, He swore he would not have them meddled with, Or driven from their eyrie on the rock For half his lordship. Ger. That's a sign of grace Beyond my lady's hopes. Tell her of that; She is among them now. Rolf. Thordisa there! Ger. Ay; with the morning she and I set forth Upon a certain distant pilgrimage; And first she prays for him; sweet, innocent soul, To waste such breath in vain. Rolf. Why does she go? And let her half-fledged warrior walk alone When most he needs her? He is but a boy, And he wants counsel. Ger. Why, what can she do? He scorns her counsel; with high words of anger They parted yesterday; oh, I am shamed To think of what he said. Rolf. He was but mad With a brief madness; for he loves her well; As well as I love you. Ger. I'll believe that, If ever the day come when he shall give Proof of his love by driving from his castle The ribald band that do deface the sun With heathen rites and wild debauchery. Rolf. And will you love me when that day shall come? Ger. Ay, that I will, and long days afterwards, And till I die, or you, or both of us; By every pretty and becoming oath, I'll love you—just as well as I do now; Not a bit better! Rolf. Mock me as you will, I yet will draw you to my lure some day; Or else may the White Pilgrim call for me. Ger. What's that? Rolf. A legend in my family. Ger. You have a family, and make love to me? Rolf. My master's family is to me as mine; I spoke in metaphor. Ger. Let that alone: Plain speaking suits you better. Rolf. 'Tis a tale Of terror, Gerda! children tremble still At the Earl Olaf's vow. 'Twill make you creep. Ger. I like to creep. Tell it. Rolf. Men say that once, Between this land and distant Normandy, There raged a bitter feud, which with the years Was dying slowly out. One of the worst And the most daring of Lord Harold's race, Who ruled in these old halls, was feasting high With kindred spirits; and half mad with wine, And all the devil in his blood let loose, He swore in fearful words a fearful oath; Swore that to Norman hand and Norman life Men owned nor knightly faith nor fealty; And that, should foot of Norman knight that day Cross but the threshold of his castle home, And seek a knightly hospitality, Within one month that trusting guest should die, By his host's hand struck to the earth and slain! Earl Olaf swore the oath in fearful words, And, as the mighty rafters rang again In hollow sound of ominous laughter back, He called on Death to register the vow! Ger. How very awful! Rolf. Is it not? Sit close, And listen how the legend runs. 'Tis said That as the last irrevocable words Fell from his impious lips, a sudden light Flashed from the chapel window, and there passed A sad and white-robed figure from its door In pilgrim guise, but veiled from foot to head, That with a gracious majesty of gait, But footfall dumb and printless, glided down, Halted awhile beside yon cairn of stone, Then like a clouded shadow passed away There, where you look! Ger. How you do frighten me I cannot listen to such tales as these Upon the very spot, and yet I feel I wouldn't lose the rest for all the world! Come this way, and go on. Rolf. Yes, step aside! Here comes my master. Leave him here awhile, And let him meet Thordisa; we will watch. Then like a clouded shadow passed away— Ger. Go on, dear Rolf, go on. [Exeunt. As they go out, Harold enters from the Castle.] Har. What forms were those? Methought I saw a woman's figure pass, And heard the rustle of a woman's dress. Again the fumes of wine—again the dream Of the one face whose starry maidenhood Shone luminous through my spirit's trackless gloom, Until my own mad hand put out the light. [Shouts and laughter within. Ay, riot on, fit mates for such as I! I know no fellowship with better things, But live as the beasts live, to die like them. A God, Thordisa said. Where is He, then? There is a Spirit of Evil, that I know, For all day long he wantons in my veins, Turns every nobler impulse into ill, And sins—and sins—and sins. 'Tis he, not I! Why, he was stronger than Thordisa's love, To which the world without him were as naught: He is a thing more living than myself; But if there is a God, where tarries He? Oh, answer me, thou great dumb oracle, Pent in the steel-blue vault above my head, In the vast silence of a world-wide grave! Is there no key that shall let in the light On all the imprisoned terrors that surround The central mystery of life and death? If thou hast ever answered, answer me! Answer, I say! [At the last words, Thordisa has entered from the Chapel. Tho. Harold! Har. What voice was that? Tho. Harold! Har. Is this mine answer? Art thou sent Out of the misty spirit-world of air To tell me—that God is? I dare not look Upon thy face. Thordisa! Can it be The ghost of a dead love that smiles on me, Or does the devil of wine fever mine eyes, And give my love-dream shape to mock at me? Thou seem'st to tell me I am pardoned. Tho. How Hast thou deserved that pardon? Har. 'Tis her voice! Sweet voice, speak on for ever! Though thou come To call me hence into an unknown world, I am prepared to go, if 'tis with thee. Tho. Do not mistake me longer; I am one As mortal and as erring as thyself. I am that same Thordisa whom you loved, Or said you did—so often—and so well! How could I choose but trust you, when you wooed With such a magic eloquence of tongue? Yet 'twas thy tongue, and not thy heart that spake. Har. It was my heart that spake, and not my tongue! My tongue is rude, and has not learnt the trade Of ready lovers; but my heart made words So true, so strong, so tender, for thy sake, They burst the barrier of common speech, And poured my very soul out at thy foot, To trample, spurn, and play with, what you pleased! If that thou art Thordisa, leave me not! If that thou art Thordisa, stay with me! If that thou art Thordisa, be to me My genius of good, my draught of health, To kill the subtle poison in my blood, Which makes me seem so all unworthy thee! There is a devil within me, if thou wilt, But all I have of good is only thine! Tho. Oh, Harold, rise! you fright me, wayward boy! You are as rough—and sunny—as the sea! As crystal seeming, yet as changeable! How can I trust you? trust is all in all; It is the keystone of that arch of love Which in its rainbow beauty spans the world! Such trust was mine; what did you do with it? Har. I know; I know; yet know not how to plead That you were ever cold— Tho. Cold, cold! for shame! Why, while the red-hot ardour of your love Was quenched even in the wine which bore it up, I with my prayers for thee was wearying Heaven, Which seemed one mirror to reflect thy face! But pardon me—I speak unmaidenly: Cold! well, I may have been; but watch the sun Behind yon bleak heights wake the tremulous dawn, Ere yet has paled the evening after-glow;— We northern maidens are not passionate; Yet is our love like to our summer, Harold— It may lack colour, but it knows no night. Har. Then let the shadow that has blurred our loves Be but the twilight link 'twixt night and day, Which softens, not obscures, their radiance. Oh, thou sweet saint, thou pretty moralist, Teach me to woo thee as thou wouldst be wooed, Even in thy loved faith's chosen formulas! Tho. 'Tis the true faith. Har. I know not; it is thine. Tho. Wilt thou then learn it? Har. Ay. Thou knowest not How often I have communed with the stars To give me answer; but they seem to me Like rivets set in the far wall of heaven To shut all entrance out. Tho. Oh no! they are Heaven's portals, Harold, golden gates that stand Unbarred above to let our prayers in; Heaven is so near. Har. It seems not so to me. Perchance I see it through a haze of wine, Which lends it distance. Let me learn of thee! I'll hold no longer with my father's gods, If they must part us two. Ask what thou wilt, So thou wilt be but mine. Take me, and take My lands, my wealth, my heritage, my youth, All that I have and all that I may win; But let me wear thee as an amulet Against the powers of evil! Tho. It may be That I too hastily left thee. But, my love, For that I hold my soul dearer than thee, That are to me more dear than all the world, Strive for my sake, strive for one little year, To be the Harold of thy lady's dream, Her very true and very upright servant, Her Christian knight in very word and deed, To cast the pagan bonds from off thy soul, Live worthy of thyself—of Heaven—of me— And, if what simple service I can render Should in thine eyes seem good, my hand shall follow The heart that I had almost lost from sight, So long ago it travelled forth—to thee. Har. But for that year, you will not leave me? Tho. No. I do not think I could; but for a while We must be parted; for I go to-morrow Upon a pilgrimage to a certain shrine, To which I have been sent— Har. Sent? Tho. Yes; a sign Was given me to obey. I shall be back Before the month is over. Har. It will seem All the long year, till then. I take thy promise; And, in what words thou wilt, I give thee mine. Tho. (taking a cross from her neck.) Here, take this cross; I give it you to wear As proxy for that amulet you spoke of, In token it is only yours. Read there. Har. (reading from the cross). “Through Life to Death—through Death to Life.” Ay, so. Thordisa mine, I will be true to thee Through Life to Death, through Death to Life! Tho. Amen! [They embrace, and go up the scene. Re-enter Rolf and Gerda. Ger. 'Tis a strange legend. Is it really true? Rolf. I always tell the truth. Ger. Here is my lady In close talk with your master. Rolf. Very close. See, Gerda, what a thing is confidence! When will you learn such confidence in me? Ger. When you become as handsome as your lord. —My lady, it grows late. Har. Peace, envious girl! Wouldst thou part lovers newly reconciled, On such an earthly plea? Ger. My lord, you owe Much to my pleading, if you knew the truth. Tho. Yes, Harold, she has ever stood your friend And mine—dear Gerda! Har. Let me thank her then, And leave my sign upon her little hand. [Kissing Gerda's hand. Ger. (to Rolf). When will you kiss with such a grace as that? Rolf. Now, if you'll let me! Tho. Have you quarrelled too? Har. Nay, pretty Gerda, be not hard with him, 'Tis a right honest fellow, take my word; And he has better merited of you Than I of my Thordisa. Ger. Possibly. He might be better looking, for all that. Rolf. Such better looks are for our betters. Rest Contented with my virtues. Tho. Gerda, come, I know you like him well. Ger. Faith, well enough! But not so well but that I'll follow you Where'er you go, dear lady, to the end. Har. Then when she places this white hand in mine, As she has sworn to me but now she will, When my year's test is over, follow her And profit by example. Tho. Now, good-bye! Thus lovers trifle with the passing hour, And find “Good-bye!” so hard a word to say. Har. Good-bye, beloved, good-bye! for one brief month, That I will wear away in thoughts of you; None else could lend it wings. Why do I draw So ill a presage from so short a parting? I should be glad, yet am I sick at heart. Tho. 'Tis but thy fancy, Harold; be but true To me and to thyself, thro' Death, to Life! [Exeunt Thordisa and Gerda. Har. Farewell, my better angel! as she goes I seem to feel the spirit of ill fall on me, To darken all her sunlight into gloom, And with its mocking echo drown her voice! Enter Sigurd from the Castle. Sig. Come, Harold, come! you were not wont to be A laggard in your cups. There's Leofric Snoring at table, Siegfried underneath it; Some fighting, and some kissing, but all do Their duty to the wine-cup manfully, Except their lazy host. Why, your wine blushes A deeper purple than its mother grape At such a want of proper courtesy. Come in and drink. Har. I'll drink no more to-night. Sig. You'll drink no more? Harold will drink no more! Hear that, ye spirits of his forefathers! Such words must cure, if anything can cure, Your everlasting deafness. Oh, my boy, Think of your gallant father's charge to me, To guard you and to keep you as myself; To train and perfect you in manly arts! And so I have. Harold, you know I have! You wrestle, fight, play, swear—as none else can; And now you turn your back upon your drink, The noblest and the manliest art of all! Rolf (aside). At least it has one merit. Drink alone Has power to bring the tears to Sigurd's eyes. Har. Truce to this fooling, Sigurd. I have said I'll have no more of it to-night. Sig. (turning on Rolf). You knave! You wretched, puny, scurvy, sober knave! This is your doing; curse your canting ways! Because your own infernal little head Declines to carry its due weight of wine, Others must thirst to please you. Har. (angrily). Let him be! And listen, Sigurd. I have had to-night A glimpse of the heaven you would shut me from; The heaven of a pure woman's holy love. Sig. A woman! Har. Ay; unless Thordisa bear Some other name, to show she stands alone Above the race of women. I know well That in all love for me you think to draw me Away from her— Sig. A recreant! false to all Her country's story and her country's gods! A priest of that rebellious heresy, That would discrown our royal deities, Make women of our men, monks of our heroes, And shame of our dear honours! Even here, In the great shadow of our fathers' halls, Fell Superstition, like a baleful star, Misleads and baffles us! A wicked witch! A pale-faced heretic! Har. Do not blaspheme! For I will live a Christian, for her sake. Rolf. And so will I for Gerda's. Sig. Hold your peace! A Christian, you! a fickle, feeble boy, Led by the halter of a woman's hair, Charmed with the sorcery of a woman's tongue, Drunk in the bad wine of a woman's eyes, Which cannot touch the palate, and but racks The head i' the morning? So, she has been here, Your white Thordisa! Wenches are the worst Of all men's damning vices—yet she comes And preaches you out of good honest liquor, And a good honest friend and guardian. I hate all women! but by my father's bones, Were she a warm frail piece of flesh and blood, With a good spice of the devil, I'd forgive you. Rolf (aside). If that's his taste, I must take care of Gerda. Sig. But this cold hypocrite— Har. Silence! One more word, And I forget my father's love for you, And all the ties between us—I forget All but the saint at whom your slanderous tongue Rails all in vain. Your insults pass her over, As idle darts the warrior armed in proof! For she is armoured against ribaldry, Even in the silver mail of maidenhood. Not for her sake I bid you pause, but mine; Mine—and your own. Breathe but another word, And dearly as I love you, we cross swords. Sig. Thou most ungrateful and irreverent boy! [Turning to the Castle. What ho, there! Leofric! Frioth! Ludwig! each And any of you that can stand upright, Come here, and listen. Enter Leofric and Frioth and Companions. Leo. What's the matter now? Is there a fight on hand? Fri. I'll bear my part, And his besides that has no stomach for it. Leo. Here's Harold with his sword out! Fri. Quarrelsome, And very drunk, no doubt. Sig. And if he were I would forgive him. Look at him, my comrades! Look at our pride—our master-spirit—our hero; Since he last left us, but an hour ago, He has turned Christian. Leo. Christian! What a freak! Fri. He really must be very drunk indeed. Fear nothing, Sigurd. Put the boy to bed; To-morrow morning he'll recant his errors. Leo. Or quite forget he'd errors to recant. Fri. Come in, my Harold, come, and have some wine! Har. When you are sober, I will talk with you. Fri. Then may you never talk with me again. Har. Sigurd, you know me! Sig. (aside). Better than you think, For a hot-headed and unstable child, Who shall forget Thordisa in a trice. Har. I would not quarrel with you, and to-night We are too heated to be reasonable. To-morrow we will speak of this again: And now I sheathe my steel; sheathe thou thy tongue. (Aside). Sweet saint, for thee I rule myself to-night, And thus begins my service. Sig. Holy sir! I am at your orders at what time you will. Fri. Is there no fight, then? This is most unfair; Who'll have a turn with me? Sig. Our Harold's valour Is not well primed to-night. He has not drunk Enough to make it boil. But he talks big, And that is something. Fri. Very sad indeed! Leo. I've often heard of Christian meeknesses, But never thought to meet with them in him. Hail, gentle creature! Fri. Hail, thou man of peace! Leo. Should but the Norman foe come back again, He'd find an easy market for his sword, When our best warriors turn saints. Sig. Not so Lord Harold's fathers talked— Har. Unmannerly! I dare do anything my fathers dared. Sig. I'll lay you a round wager that you dare not— A thousand crowns! Har. I take your wager! Fri. Bravo! Next to a fight I love a bet. [Sigurd whispers to Leofric, who goes into the Castle, and returns with a large sword. Rolf (to Harold). My lord, Think of Thordisa. Har. So I do. Would she Have me insulted thus? Sig. I wager then That the Lord Harold dares not take the oath His bold forefather swore upon the sword The oath they call Earl Olaf's. Rolf. Oh, not that! Why do you call that devilish memory up, Tempter? Sig. (threatening him). What means the rascal? Rolf. I care not! Do what you please; ay, kill me if you will; But let not my dear master soil his lips With blasphemies like that. He shall not do it While I stand by. Fri. Then you shall not stand by, For I'll proceed at once to knock you down! Har. Back, Frioth! This is folly. Norman foot Has never trod our coast for years. Sig. And yet You are afraid to take that oath! Pay down Your crowns, and write yourself a coward, boy. Har. Coward! you lie! [Drawing. Sig. Oh, you will fight, perhaps, But dare not take the oath! Har. I dare, and will. All. Bravo! The oath! The oath! Rolf. My lord! My lord! Har. Silence, I say! I'll not be baited thus. Shall I be frighted with a bugbear, made To scare a baby with? Sig. (giving him the sword). Here is the weapon! I say you dare not do it! Har. Listen, then. Rolf. Oh, Heaven, be deaf to him, and pardon us! Har. (lays his hand upon the sword and recites the oath, while the others, except Rolf, gather round). By the might of Odin's hand, By the light of Odin's brand, By the trumpet-blast sent forth On the echoes of the north, By the thunderbolt of war Welded by the hand of Thor, By this falchion's jewelled hilt, By the blood its blade hath spilt, Northern valour, Norman guilt, By its dye of scarlet red, By the living, by the dead— Ere the world's unmeasured bound Once the sun hath travelled round, Should but foot of Norman fall In the shadow of my wall, Yonder moon of silver stain Shall not wane and wax again, Ere with sure and secret blow I will lay that Norman low! By mine own hand he shall die, Meed of Norman perjury! If he fall not so, then Death Call for me that break my faith! Hear mine oath, and mark it well; Be my witness, Death—and Hell! [All stand silent in a circle round the sword. Rolf, on his knees, gazes back at the chapel. A light appears in the window, and the White Pilgrim enters from the chapel, and walks silently down to the stone in the centre at the back, and there pauses, unseen by all but Rolf. A bell strikes one. Rolf (aside). 'Tis the White Pilgrim, and they see him not! [The sound of a horn is heard outside; all start. Har. What sound is that?—a stranger—at the gate?— And at this hour! Great Heaven! Sig. What can it mean? Har. (to Rolf). Go, see who asks admittance. [Rolf goes out. As he goes, the White Pilgrim goes off slowly behind the Castle on the opposite side. The others stand grouped, in silence, in the centre till Rolf returns. Well, what news? Rolf. A stranger knight—and lady—at the gate! Har. Bid them come in. [Rolf introduces Hugo and Isabelle, who come forward; Harold and the others standing back, as in fear. Hugo. This is cold welcome, sirs, For a spent traveller, who has wandered far. Har. From what—land—do you come? Hugo. From Normandy. The Curtain Falls. Between the First and Second Acts a month, all but a day, is supposed to elapse. ACT II. Scene.—The same. Morning. Enter from the Castle Sigurd and Rolf. Rolf. I say it must not be. Sig. I say it shall. You're a nice knave to preach flat perjury To the “good master,” whom you whine about. I do not like the business, and am sorry I ever put him on it; but to waste Time in regrets is idle. He has sworn, And trifles with his purpose all too long. To-morrow ends the month, and the sun sets On Harold perjured, or on Hugo dead. Rolf. And were that all, there were no room for doubt; I had rather see him perjured ten times o'er, Than turn a murderer for conscience' sake. Sig. You irreligious dog! An oath is sacred: What is a Norman more or less, to that? He swore to strike the blow, and strike himself. Would I might do the deed, and that my hand Might save young Harold from the penalty Which must await him if he break the vow. Rolf (aside). Ay, the White Pilgrim! did I dream that night? Was that pale phantom my embodied fear? No! it was real; I saw it! You speak truly; And, tempter that you are, Lord Harold's life Hangs on the base fulfilment of his vow. Oh, my dear master, must I see thee die, Or live a thing of shame, a traitor, false To hospitable trust, to knightly honour, Outcast from heaven and from Thordisa's love? Sig. That love is out of date. [Pointing off the stage. Look where he goes With his new charmer—with his dainty sample Of luscious fruit grafted from southern vines Upon our polar ice. What pretty things He whispers in the little ear, which blushes In proof it listens not! “Sweet Isabelle,” “I never loved till now!” Ay, ay, go on. Rolf. You do him grievous wrong; he would not be So light and fickle a thing. Sig. Fickle, not he! Once let a man swear vassalage to women, And he remains so very true to them, That, if the first should leave him for awhile, He must e'en find a second, then and there. I like this wanton well; for she will arm Young Harold's hand against her husband's life, Which stands between their passion and the sun. The iron is red hot, the furnace full! And of the flowers that spring from Hugo's grave, Harold shall weave new chains for Isabelle. I must go call the Norman to the chase, His last! Sing on, my love-birds! ere to-morrow To harsher chords we'll fit your melody. [Exit into Castle. Rolf. Can such a liar speak truth, and has my lord So soon forgot Thordisa? No, not he; I'll not believe it! Courtesy, not love, Draws him to Isabelle; that man's foul thoughts Soil purity itself. Her gentle face Must palsy Harold's arm ere it can strike At his guest and her husband. Horrible! Since that accursëd night I live in fear Lest every moment bring a deed so black That it would overcast the smiling Heaven, And from its own dark womb draw lightning down To scorch us into nothingness! And yet, What if the vow be broken—if that life That I, poor slave, have loved and tended so, Must perish as the forfeit? Many a time Would I have warned these Normans of their danger, But that I feared their safety were his death. Where is Thordisa? Why, thou guardian saint, Leav'st thou thy shrine untenanted, when most Our knees should wear the stones out at thy foot In agony of prayer? I have not dared To breathe the fearful secret in the ear Of living soul, till she return. Enter Harold and Isabelle from the shore. Rolf watches behind. Isa. Your friends Will miss you, my Lord Harold. Har. Gentle lady, They have your husband with them as my pledge. May I not stay with you? Rolf (aside). Too close, too close! Isa. You ask the favour of me rather late. Have you not stayed some time? Har. I do not think it. In your sweet presence time goes much too fast. Isa. (aside). And other things go quite as fast as time. I thought you told me that you never learned To flatter, my kind host? Har. I never have. Isa. Faith, then, it comes by instinct, or by ear. There's ne'er a gallant in our Norman court Pays compliments so smooth. Har. Am I not rough? I always thought so; but would gladly change The image of myself my thoughts reflect, If they distort it. Isa. Good Sir Pagan, no, I can't deny the roughness; but it makes The better setting for smooth compliments. Contrast is always pleasing. Har. Then I think That I should please you well. Isa. Perhaps you do; But change the subject. Rolf. (aside). It is time to change it! Isa. You said that time flies fast, and you said true; One month to-morrow since we stormed your hold And took possession. Why do you start so? Har. (aside). A month to-morrow! Oh, how I have striven To drown the memory; to think of it As of an evil nightmare born of wine! That oath, I dare not break, and cannot keep! How have I lived since then! Isa. What mutter you? Some Pagan charm against the evil eye? Am I so dangerous? Har. All is dangerous here! Most dangerous to yourself—to your lord—to me! There's danger in the sea and in the air, Danger within the castle, and without, Danger by day, by night, above, around, Danger in the eye that drinks your beauty in, And danger—in the hand that presses yours! Isa. (shrinking as he takes her hand), You hurt me! What means this? Rolf (coming up to her and speaking rapidly). It means he is right! Danger there is—it comes! Enter Sigurd, Hugo, Leofric, Frioth, &amp;c. Hugo. My good Lord Sigurd, You do yourself much wrong—our monarchs give No truer hospitality than you. Good morrow, my brave host. You were stirring early: You join the chase with us? Har. No; not to-day. Hugo. Why is your face so clouded? Isabelle, Is there a quarrel between him and you? Isa. Something has crossed him, sir; I know not what. (Aside to Hugo) I pray you, Hugo, make him go with you, And I will wait within for your return. Har. Fair Isabelle, I am not so much a churl As to leave you untended and alone. These gentlemen will pardon me, if to-day I bear you company. Isa. That will not I, then! And, good mine host, you have so maimed my hand, That I am better tended—by myself; While air and exercise will cool your brain, Which, I think, needs it. Rolf, come in with me. [Exeunt Isabelle and Rolf into Castle. Hugo. You have your quittance. Come, 'twere sin to tarry; See how the hunt of heaven is afoot! The clouds that chase each other through the skies Vie with the hounds' impatience, and set us A great example. 'Tis a day for sport To make a hunter of a hermit. Sig. (apart to Har.) Harold, What mean these looks, man? Har. Do not speak to me! You know their meaning.—Friends, I am not well, And you must pardon me. Leo. Impossible! There are some sins past pardon. Shun the chase! Fri. You ill deserve the bottle if you do. My life upon it that he means to stay, And have a morning drink all to himself. Harold, this is not fair, upon my soul. Hugo. Let me entreat you, friend. Sig. Leave him to me; I know his moods, Sir Knight, and will persuade him, Ere you have passed the mountain, to put by This gloomy humour. Leo. Come, then, to the chase. [Exeunt all but Harold and Sigurd. Sig. Harold— Har. Begone and leave me, tempter! fiend! Do I not know you? I can read your face, And speak the words in which your lips would hiss Their poison in mine ear. The hour is come When I have sworn to do a thing more vile Than e'er the vilest did, and write myself More vile than they, than villany, than thou! But—I have sworn it! Sigurd, you have been My guardian, father, and, I thought, my friend. Is there no way but this? I am ill-taught, Uncultured, rude of spirit and of speech, But I have loved you—you, and one beside! Thordisa, my good angel, come to me! I dare not think of her, or I go mad! Sig. Think not of her, then. I am sorry, boy, To see you thus—I am sorry that my tongue Outran my sense that night, and laid this oath Upon your soul—but, Harold, it is there! I never thought of it save as a jest. Har. Then as a jest let me but pass it by. Sig. It may not be—you know it! After all, The Heaven you grope your way so blindly after Must have a purpose on this Norman's life, Or it had never sent him here so pat. And what is a man's life, that you should make So much ado about it? Every day Your Heaven takes many lives, with much less cause, And just as blindly, here and there, by chance! Har. Blasphemer! Sig. Nonsense; it's philosophy. Har. But this man is my guest; his hand and mine Have clasped each other; and the wife he loves— Sig. You love. More reason; now, it is a sin; Then, you may do it freely. Har. It is false! I do not love her. From my darkened soul Thordisa stands severed as by a veil! With the good part of me I worship her, And that you have robbed me of. My evil self Woos this warm beauty's fiery loveliness As it woos the wine-cup, for oblivion! Sig. Then woo her to some purpose, man alive! Why, the rich blood that wantons in her cheeks Flutters an answering signal to Desire, Whene'er you speak with her. She's a glorious prize For the bold cruiser in forbidden seas! Take heart of grace, man; do what must be done— You have delayed too long. Har. My guest and friend! Sig. Who made him so? Had you but kept your vow A month ago—not feasted him, and fawned, Where you were sworn to strike—he had not been Aught but a doomed and alien enemy. It must be done to-day! Har. There is one day more; Let him live till to-morrow. Sig. No, to-day. Har. Well, be it so. I dare not break that oath; Its fearful burden's damning monotone Appals my sense—I dare not break that oath! Oh, were it but to die instead of him, I would die fifty thousand deaths a day; But to die perjured is to die accursed, And to be pointed at in worlds unknown As he that did the worst the worst can do! Look down on me, ye spirits of my sires, See what your faith, your creed, have done for me! I know no other creed, no better faith! Thordisa's God is deaf—Thordisa gone. And I am helpless. I will do this thing! And as all mercy fails me, I will fill The measure to the full. I will win that woman, And riot in her arms, until we two, Locked in an earthy and abhorred embrace, Go down together to the lowest deep, Embosomed in the everlasting fire! But—you and I are of one blood no more! And mark me, when we meet beyond the earth, In whatsoever place lost spirits are, I will nor touch your hand, nor know your face, For ever and for ever! In an hour I will meet you in the wood, at the mountain's foot, And damn us both at once. Go to our friends, Bid Hugo look for me in an hour, in the wood! [Exeunt severally. Rolf has re-entered at the back with Isabelle just at the last words. Rolf. An hour! In the wood! You heard the words? Isa. I did, But know not what they mean. Why do you hint So darkly, man? Speak out, and speak your mind, If you have got one. Rolf. I can scarcely tell Whether I have or no—whether I am Or am not—whether anything has been Or ever will be. What I ought to do Is quite beyond me, a poor willing knave, That only seeks to live at peace with men And women—Gerda most especially. Oh, where is Gerda, to advise with me? She ever says there's wisdom in my head, And thinks that she can find it. I can not! Isa. I vow, the changes of the northern moon Give colour to the proverb, that the brain Turns with its turnings. Both your lord and you Are strangely out of tune. When first we came, You greeted us with such scant courtesy And such odd looks, that we had almost gone, Wrecked as we were upon your coast, to find Some other shelter. As the moon grew less Our cheer grew better. Now she broadens over The face of Heaven once more— Rolf. Ay, ay, that's it. Isa. What is it, in God's name? Rolf. Not in God's name, But in the devil's! More I dare not say Than I have told you. Keep my master by you, Encourage him, let him make love to you, Make love to him—do anything on earth Save let him join the hunt, or go to-night To that dark wood he spoke of—dark indeed With all the shadows of the nether gloom. (Aside). He shall not do the deed; though the white robe Of that dread visitant enshroud us all, And make one mighty pall on Nature's face, In folds to shrivel her!—Look, my lord comes! I dare not meet him now. Remember well The charge I gave you—for your husband's life! [Exit. Isa. My husband's life! What can this warning mean? His wild words strike the key of mine own dread. All things are savage here; at night, the air Seems living with strange whispers, which the day Swells to a louder tone; I seemed to hear One when he spoke. What would they do with us? Ah, my young host, beware a woman's wit! Forewarned, forearmed, they say, and I will throw About your eyes a mist of witchery, To which your warlocks, and your imps, and all Your battery of pagan devilries, Shall be a common conjuror's clumsy play. You shall not leave my side to-night, Lord Harold, Before I know your secrets as mine own. I am a practised warrior, and in arms. Here comes the enemy! Enter Harold. Still muttering charms? Har. Charms for the charmer! Ah! I thought the sun Shone brighter than it did a while ago. It has come back again to shine on you. Isa. I think the sun is hidden in a cloud. Har. Then 'tis because she sees a rival here, And dares not show her face. Isa. The sun's a man! Har. A woman, on my life! a very woman! A woman in her light, her warmth, her splendour, Whose satellites pale before her where she goes. A woman! for 'tis summer where she lingers, And winter when she hastens to be gone! A woman! for she warms one land to life, Then leaves it for another—blighted—blank— You are my sun. I love you! Isa. (terrified). Ah! Har. I see You are afraid of me—yes, you are fair, And, I think, pure and good; (aside) and what have I To do with goodness and with purity? My hand can strike him; soil her it shall not. Forgive me. I spoke wildly. Fare you well! Isa. (aside). The wood! He must not leave me! Do not go! Har. (aside). Sigurd was right, then. We are all alike; Women and men—save one!—I will stay with you For ever, if you will. Isa. That's a long day. Har. Is it? I fear it is. Isa. You say you love me? It is a courtly phrase, and means, I know, No more than fashion. Let us walk this way. (Aside). Will the time never pass?—Why do you start? Har. It was a sudden gust that stirred the trees. (Aside). Methought Thordisa's voice was on the wind Wailing a sad good-bye!—You are beautiful! [Exeunt behind the Castle. Enter Thordisa. Tho. How slowly heavenward rolls the stream of time For parted lovers; but how swift the tide, Slipping in noiseless current out of sight, When on his full broad breast he bears along Two happy lives in sweet companionship. Thus Love points out the quickest road to Heaven, And Heaven's best angel upon earth is Love. How will you meet me, Harold? Oh, my soul Shrinks from its own excess of happiness. Thou art too much the burden of my prayers, Too much my mcarnate Heaven—too much? Oh, no. I'll not believe it; 'tis an idle fear Engendered of the Evil One, who tempts us To put aside the choicest cup that God Has offered to our lips. I cannot think Too much of him that only thinks of me. To-day, then, I shall see him once again, And feel once more his kisses on my lips, And speak with him once more, and once more hear The words of the troth-plight he plighted me, The words— Isa. (without). Through Life to Death, through Death to Life! Tho. A woman's voice! A woman's!—oh! no, no! My ears deceive me—that way came the sound; I heard it. [Looks off the Scene. Ah! Yes: I did love too much! [She falls back and listens. Enter Harold and Isabelle. Isa. A pretty posy, and a pretty token: Who gave it you? Har. What matter? It was given me By a vision, in a dream, a dream that passed So long ago. Tho. (aside). One month! Har. Don't speak of it. Speak only of ourselves; there are to us No others in the world; its mighty orbit Has not an inch of breathing space save that My passion needs. Will you not answer me Save with excuses? Dalliance is well; But there are better things than dalliance. Isa. (aside). I know not what to do; I am at the end Of all my fence.—Nay, but I have a fancy That in this text you pledge yourself to me. Har. I will not. Isa. No? Then you have sworn most falsely, And I will never trust so false a love. Har. Ask anything but that. Isa. No other boon I care to ask. 'Tis but a little thing, And it means nothing. Tho. (aside). Nothing! Har. No; not much. I will buy you at that price—(Aside) nor you alone! —Fair Isabelle, I will be true to thee Through Life to Death, through Death to Life! [Music heard from the Chapel. Isa. What's that? CHANT IN THE CHAPEL. Pray for the passing soul, Soft let the death-bell toll Over the dying; In the light breeze whose breath Perfumes the road to death, Angels are sighing! Har. I'll have those Christians silenced. I have said it; And if we need a witness, Death, attend And take me at my word! Tho. (aside). Ay, come, come, Death! In the most fearful of the shapes you wear, Take them and me! Ay, come, thou thing accursed! Come, terrible phantom! severer of hearts That beat for thee to blight when hope is highest! Thou stealthy reaper of the golden grain! Thou image of the darkness whereupon Thou sitt'st enthroned! Thou nightmare of the night! Come with the cruellest weapons that thou hast, Red-heated from thine awful armoury! Bring all thy choicest tortures for these two, And spare me not. Come, fiend! [The White Pilgrim appears, seen only by Thordisa; she throws herself between it and the others. Oh, no, not yet! Isa. It is very cold. Oh, take me from this place; There is a rush of darkness in the air. I am afraid. Har. Fear nothing; come with me. [Exeunt Harold and Isabelle. Tho. Spirit, I know thee not. I look on thee With awe, but not with terror. All my fears Fall from me as a garment. Art thou— Pilgrim. Hush, Miscall me not! Men have miscalled me much; Have given harsh names and harsher thoughts to me, Reviled and evilly entreated me, Built me strange temples as an unknown God, Then called me idol, devil, unclean thing, And to rude insult bowed my godhead down. Miscall me not! for men have marred my form, And in the earth-born grossness of their thought Have coldly modelled me of their own clay, Then fear to look on that themselves have made. Miscall me not! ye know not what I am, But ye shall see me face to face, and know. I take all sorrows from the sorrowful, And teach the joyful what it is to joy. I gather in my land-locked harbour's clasp The shattered vessels of a vexèd world, And even the tiniest ripple upon life Is, to my calm sublime, as tropic storm. When other leech-craft fails the breaking brain, I, only, own the anodyne to still Its eddies into visionless repose. The face, distorted with life's latest pang, I smoothe, in passing, with an angel wing; And from beneath the quiet eyelids steal The hidden glory of the eyes, to give A new and nobler beauty to the rest. Belie me not; the plagues that walk the Earth, The wasting pain, the sudden agony, Famine, and War, and Pestilence, and all The terrors that have darkened round my name, These are the works of Life, they are not mine; Vex when I tarry, vanish when I come, Instantly melting into perfect peace, As at His word, whose master-spirit I am, The troubled waters slept on Galilee. Tender I am, not cruel: when I take The shape most hard to human eyes, and pluck The little baby-blossom yet unblown, 'Tis but to graft it on a kindlier stem, And, leaping o'er the perilous years of growth, Unswept of sorrow, and unscathed of wrong, Clothe it at once with rich maturity. 'Tis I that give a soul to memory; For round the follies of the bad I throw The mantle of a kind forgetfulness; But, canonised in dear Love's calendar, I sanctify the good for evermore. Miscall me not! my generous fulness lends Home to the homeless, to the friendless friends; To the starved babe, the mother's tender breast; Wealth to the poor, and to the restless—rest! Shall I unveil, Thordisa? If I do, Then shall I melt at once the iron bonds Of this mortality that fetters thee. Gently, so gently, like a tired child, Will I enfold thee. But thou may'st not look Upon my face, and stay. In the busy haunts Of human life, in the temple and the street, And when the blood runs fullest in the veins, Unseen, undreamed of, I am often by, Divided from the giant in his strength But by the thickness of this misty veil. But none can look behind that veil, and stay. Shall I withdraw it now? Tho. A little while! Give me a little yet! Spirit, I love him And would not go till I have heard once more In accents whose rich music was the tune To which my life was set, not that he loves me, But that he loved me once. Spirit, not yet! I am all too earthly in my thoughts of him; I am not fit for— Pilgrim. Hush! Miscall me not! [The Spirit disappears; Thordisa remains prostrate. Enter Gerda. Ger. Mistress, where are you? Tho. Gerda, come away! I have much to say; I cannot tell it here. Tread softly! look not! speak not! Come away! [Thordisa remains looking backward to the place where the Spirit stood. CHANT IN THE CHAPEL. Death here is lord of all! Spread we the funeral pall, Hoping, not sighing! In the far land where rest Those whom God loves the best, There is no dying. The Curtain Falls. ACT III. Scene.—The same. Evening. Horns heard. Enter Hugo, Sigurd, Leofric, and Frioth. Hugo. A goodly capture, and a goodly day! Where is our host, that he breaks faith with us, And will not share in the sport? Leo. Faith, 'tis his loss. He is the foremost hunter of us all, And makes me feel a bungler at his side. Fri. (to Leofric). I fancy that he's hunting somewhere else, And means to run his game down for himself. Leo. (to Frioth). Ah, but his oath? Fri. (to Leofric). Oath! pshaw! a drunkard's vow! When was it that he swore? A month ago! What was it that he swore? I quite forget! It is the noble privilege of wine To give full license to our memories To play us fast and loose as best we please. To take a joke in earnest is a thing Which makes a man bad company for his kind. Sig. I am ashamed, Sir Hugo, of our host; But he lacks breeding. Hugo. No, you do him wrong; He is a right good gentleman at heart. Our courtly polish lends a fair outside, But often rubs away the sterling worth, Which is too rough of mould to take it well. Sig. (aside). Has he turned coward? Is he shrinking still From his sworn purpose, that but now his hand Was armed to work on? Or has Isabelle Drugged all his senses into impotence? A curse upon a woman's apron-strings! Their knots are far too intricate to play with. Hugo. Here comes the laggard, and my wife! Fri. (to Leofric). You see! He brings his bag with him. Enter Harold and Isabelle. Isa. Returned at last! (Aside). Thank Heaven for this! [She goes to Hugo. Har. (aside). She seeks her husband's side! Has she been fooling me? Sig. (to Harold). Where have you been? Have you forgot again? Har. (to Sigurd). I shall forget Just what I please, and when! Sig. (aside). Nay, then, by Heaven I'll shame him to the proof! I will tell Hugo His wife is wanton, and call up the devil Of jealousy to aid me! Hugo (to Isabelle). Isabelle, Why do you tremble so? Isa. (to Hugo). Oh, my dear lord, If you but knew how I have looked for you! My eyes are happy in your safe return. Hugo (to Isabelle). My safe return! Am I so poor a hunter That you fear danger for me? Isa. (to Hugo). Yes, I do! I would we were far hence, with all my heart! Hugo (to Isabelle). You were not wont to be so fearful, child. Sig. (aside). The lover and the husband! rare dissembler! Why, what a brazen thing a woman is! Har. (aside). She hangs about his neck! her lips are his— Only her promises are mine! (to Isabelle). Take care; The price you offered must be paid in full. Hugo. Lord Harold, answer for this trembler here. What have you said to her? Sig. (aside). Ay, tell him that! And if you don't, I will, before to-morrow! Isa. (aside). I dare not tell him! Did I breathe the truth, Then my lord's life were forfeited indeed. Would Rolf but tell me all!—My noble husband, He has been speaking of strange things to me; Whispering wild tales of witchcraft. Hugo. Is that all? We'll match them with some legends of our own Over the wine-cup. Fri. Come to it at once, then! I am as dry as a bookworm! Enter Rolf from the Castle. Rolf. My Lord Harold, The supper waits. Fri. Oh, blessèd messenger! Be all your sins forgiven you for those words! Harold, my Harold, you were slack in the chase, And if you have not gained an appetite, I'll eat for both of us—and drink, if need be, For all the party! Har. Gentlemen, come in. Fair lady, will you grace us with your presence, As is your wont? Isa. (to Harold). Spare me your witchcraft, then. Har. (to her). You have not spared me yours. Fri. Make haste, make haste. [Exeunt into the Castle all but Sigurd and Rolf, the former stopping the latter as he is following. Sig. A word with you. Is it your doing, knave, That the strong wings of opportunity Flit thus unheeded by, when we should clip And chain them to our uses? Have you come Again between this Norman and his fate, And with your scruples cooled your master's courage, As water drenches wine? You love him not, then? Rolf. I love him better than I love my life, Better than all the world (except, perhaps, One foolish little woman, whom I miss More than discretion). 'Tis you love him not, But only love your malice and yourself! Why do you hate the Norman? Sig. For his youth And for his fairness, as I hate the world, The light, and whatsoever power it is That brings men such as I am into being, And vents its spite on me, who will give back As much—and more. For I have but the space Of a short life to circumscribe my spleen, While it may fashion others like to me, And spit its venom out to the end of time. I love that boy, though—or I think I do— And he shall keep his word; I know a spell To set those two at one another's throats. [Going in, Rolf stands between him and the door. Rolf. You shall not say it, then! Sig. (advancing). Ha! Enter Gerda. Ger. Rolf! Rolf. Who is that? Gerda! Now all goes well, all must go well, Gerda, my life, my angel! [Crosses to her. Ger. Touch me not, Thou worthy slave of an unworthy lord! Sig. (aside). Well done, propitious stars! I called upon The devil of jealousy, and he sends me here His own familiar. [He stops behind and listens. Rolf. Why, what have I done? Ger. Oh, I don't know. You best can answer that. Rolf. I'll tell you everything. Ger. No. Such a tale Were little fitted for a maiden's ear. Oh, you abominably wicked man! Faith-breaker, light-o'-love, pagan! Rolf. That's enough! Such ugly words ill suit such pretty lips. Ger. How dare you pay a compliment to me? Rolf. I couldn't help it, and I never can. Ger. You never spoke a truer word than that. Little you care to whom you pay them, though; You offer them, you know, with such a grace, So prettily, so daintily, so—Ah! My very fingers tingle to the tips To think of all the hussies you've been courting In the same language that you talked to me! Little you care for that, though, I suppose; All women are alike, sir, are they not, Mere pegs to hang a compliment upon? Rolf. All women like? Well, if they talk like that, I hope they are not, for the sake of men. And as for pegs, pray Heaven that some of them Abide more quietly in their holes than you, Nor creak so harshly. Ger. Oh, how dare you come Here to insult me? Rolf. Gerda! I declare This is too much. Ger. Too much, am I? No doubt, You've had enough without me. Have I lived To hear I am “too much!” Rolf. Not you—not you. I didn't say so. Ger. But you thought it, sir. I saw you think it, and I see you now. Rolf. You don't. Ger. I do. Rolf. You can't, for no such thought Was in my mind. Ger. Your mind! I dare say not. I know that I can see farther than most, But not even I can look into your mind, Because it isn't there to look into. Sig. (aside). Now, this is very meat and drink to me. Rolf. Hear me! Ger. Good heavens! how you interrupt! Haven't I heard you quietly all this time? Rolf. Oh! have you finished? Ger. Finished—no, indeed! I've scarcely yet begun. Rolf (gloomily). Then I believe I shall not be alive to hear the end. Ger. So much the better for the female sex. Sig. (aside). And with this sort of goods men fall in love. (Coming forward). Good even, gentle creature! Ger. Who are you? Lord Sigurd? Rolf. I forgot him.(To Gerda). He has heard All you've been saying. Ger. (to Rolf). All you said to me Is more to the purpose; what he thinks of you I can't imagine; me you heard him call A gentle creature. Rolf (to Gerda). That was irony. Ger. Don't let him try his “irony” with me, I'll not endure it. Pardon me, my lord, (quieting herself) I am not smooth enough in speech for you, But come as fair Thordisa's messenger. Sig. And speak in fair Thordisa's gracious tones. Rolf (to Gerda). That's irony again. Ger. (to Rolf). Then I will match him With his own weapons. Oh, my courteous lord, My handsome, kind Lord Sigurd, I am come To Harold, from Thordisa! We have heard Much of his Norman visitors—his fine lady And—all her women. Rolf. On my life and love, There's not a woman with her! Is that all That made you jealous? Ger. Jealous! what, of you? How dare you call me jealous? Rolf. If you're not, I don't know what a woman is. Ger. Indeed! You ought to, by this time. Rolf. Again, I swear There's but one woman here! Ger. A harem of them! I've heard about your dainty Southern dames; They want six maids to put their hair in curl, As many more to take it out again; Some fan them when they're hot, more fan the fire When they are cold—a harem, sir, I swear! Rolf. Lord Sigurd, tell her that I speak the truth. Sig. She'd not believe me. Ger. Very likely not. When I believed his promises, I believed A man just once too often. They are made All of the self-same kidney. Where is Harold? What are my wrongs to my lady's? Where is he? That I may ask him in whose ear he whispered Here, in this place, a few short hours ago, The very words with which he won the heart That he has broken. Oh, how could he do it? Sig. And—those words were? Ger. Thro' Life to Death—thro' Death To Life! Sig. Indeed, a very pretty text! Thank you—I'll ask him. Rolf. Mischief! I forgot. [Going to the door. Sigurd passes before him mockingly, and on the threshold crosses Isabelle, who enters from the Castle. He bows to her and goes in. Isa. Hist! Rolf, where are you? Ger. (starting). There, I told you so. One of your women wants you. Rolf. Gerda, hush! Ger. Why should I hush? I shan't! Rolf. This is the lady Of whom you spoke just now— Isa. Where are you, Rolf? Come here to me; I have no friend but you. Ger. Oh, you abandoned person! Isa. (with dignity). This to me? Who are you? You mistake. Ger. (looking at her). I think I do. Your face is gentle, but why are you here? Are you that Norman that has stolen away A false heart from Thordisa? Isa. I know not Of whom you speak, nor who Thordisa is, Or you! But you are woman, and I pine To see a woman's face. I have met with none Since first I reached this fatal place till now. Rolf (to Gerda). I told you so. Ger. Are you quite sure of that? Isa. 'Tis Heaven's own truth. Rolf (to Gerda). There! Ger. (to Rolf). I forgive you, then, For all your falsehood and your violence. Isa. Do not turn from me; be not harsh with me; Woman ne'er needed woman's counsel more. Listen! My fears have overmastered me; I am a stranger on your northern coast, Save for my husband, friendless and alone! He has no thought of fear, nor will believe The dangers that surround us. I know not Or what they are, or whence! But in all eyes I read imagined terrors every hour; I cannot bear it. (To Rolf). Make your warnings clear, And shape the horrors we must cope withal, Or—I— [Fainting. Ger. Bring water, she has fainted. Quick! [Exit Rolf. Enter Thordisa. She has a fair face! Tho. (coming forward). Let me look at it; Yes, a fair face; and fairer far than mine. Ger. It is not true. Tho. He thinks so; that's enough. And yet—what is there, Gerda, in these lines, That they should so cross and disfigure mine, As leave no trace of them? Ger. Ay, what, indeed? Why, they are poor and pale. Tho. Yes; so they are. But then the blood has left them for a while; And when it courses from the heart again, And in full channel overflows the veins, Gives redness to the lip, bloom to the cheek, And lustre to the eye, then you shall see How tempting ripe she is. What if I stole Blood from her arm, think you that it would warm And make me wanton? He might love me then. Ger. Oh, do not speak like that! Tho. No; she is fair. Re enter Rolf. Rolf. My lady! oh, my lady! ere she wakes Give me your counsel; only you can help My master in his sorest need. Tho. You jest! I am nothing to your master; here is she That shall advise him. Rolf. No; you do him wrong. You know not in how terrible a strait You left him when you parted from this place. I sought you in the morning—you were gone! That night! that awful night! Do you remember The legend that I told you, Gerda? Ger. Ay; Earl Olaf's vow. I never was so frightened In all my life. Tho. I know that legend well. What of it now? Rolf. That very night, my lord, Goaded by Sigurd past endurance, took, In all its terrible solemnity, That oath upon him. Tho. and Ger. What? Rolf. And scarce had sworn, Before these Normans came—this woman here And her brave husband. Tho. Husband! Yes, go on. Rolf. The month expires to-morrow. Ere that time, With his own hand, his own guest he must slay, Or pay the forfeit. Ger. Ah! Tho. Be still; she wakes! Isa. (recovering herself). Where am I? Was I dreaming? Did I see A woman's face just now? (Seeing Thordisa.) It was not yours. Hugo! Tho. Fear nothing for him. Isa. What are you That are so sad and stern, and yet so sweet? I dread you, yet I trust you. Oh, your eyes Have all the depth of Heaven in their blue, And all its truth; and you are very fair. Tho. Do you think so? Isa. Yes. Tho. You are no scholar, then, And read to little purpose. Let your glass Tell you what beauty is, or what men think That beauty should be. Gerda, you and Rolf Take charge of her, and lead her to my house. Isa. Your house? Tho. You wonder? Well, perhaps you might If you knew all. But doubtless you have heard Lord Harold speak of a poor slighted thing, A woman called Thordisa? Isa. No. Tho. Indeed! That's passing strange. But now, go to my house, You will be safe from danger there—not here. Isa. My husband— Tho. Do you love him? Isa. From my heart! Tho. Then what of Harold? Isa. He is but a boy. I did but sport with him, and he with me. Tho. Sport! I can bear no more! Take her away! I answer for your husband. Ere the morning He shall be safe with you. Oh, do not touch me! Isa. I cannot understand you. I have done No wrong to any; there's some error here. You will not save my husband? Tho. I have said I can, and will; and you may trust me. Isa. Yes; I see I can. Heaven bless you! Tho. Mock me not! [Exeunt Isabelle, Gerda, and Rolf. Earl Olaf's vow! What is a vow to him That he should keep it—he, who swore to me One short year's fealty one long month ago, Then, with a lip still wet with kiss of mine, And in the very words my folly lent him To snare a woman with, could pawn again His counterfeit of love yet unredeemed, And lie his soul away? But then that oath, Of which Rolf told me? If he break his faith With me, a woman, penalty is none For such a trifle; but Earl Olaf's vow! How runs the legend? If he keep it—murder! And if he break it—death! Well, what then? Why, I have seen and spoken with it. Oh, The ground is holy where thy feet have trod, Thou mystery of beauty and of love! Thy silver tones must lead the worst aright, And teach the falsest, truth. Death! Let it take him. [Shouts and sounds of quarrel from within. What noise is that? [She falls back and listens. Enter Harold, Hugo, Sigurd, Leofric, and Frioth. Hugo. By Heaven, I'll have from you Your answer to this charge! What, play the traitor To your own guest, that trusted you as fully As brother trusts to brother! Is it true That Sigurd hints? Sig. Nay, nay, I hinted nothing. Be gentle with him, Harold; he has drunk Too much for wisdom. Good Sir Hugo, see, Harold is mad with wine—it were not well To press him now. Har. I will not talk with you While you are heated thus. Hugo. I say you shall. Sig. Oh, that my innocent words should work such ill! It was a jest, Sir Hugo, but a jest! Thro' Life to Death, thro' Death to Life! a pledge Of little meaning! I but bade you ask him To whom he gave it— Hugo. He shall answer that. Does he speak truly? Did you say those words To a woman—here—but now? Sig. (aside). It works, it works! Let me against each other arm those two, And I will look to it which of them shall fall. Hugo. Answer him, answer! Did you speak those words? Har. Yes, I did speak them. Fall my sins on me And all who cross me. I did speak those words, And I will answer for them with my life, My life, or yours! There is no man in the world That shall dare question me! Hugo. Before all here, In full arraignment, you shall plead to this: To whom were those words spoken? Say, to whom, And damn thyself! Tho. (coming forward). He spoke those words to me. The Curtain Falls. A lapse of Twenty-four Hours. ACT IV. Scene.—The same. Night. A Storm raging. Sigurd discovered alone. Sig. Forsworn, forsworn! within an hour, forsworn! Unless the spiteful pilot of the world, Who laughs to see men sorry, should bethink him Of that same silken-favoured Norman there, As a fair freight worth wrecking in its prime, And blasting into everlasting waste, Just when it promises best. Why, when I die, I needs must have some share i' the government Of mortal business, for it goes almost As cross as I would rule it. Enter Rolf. Well, what news? What does your master? Does he know the hour? Rolf. He sits and watches time as it goes by; And ever as the last sands leave the glass, And mark another footprint on the day, He moves his lips and mutters to himself Something I cannot hear. Sig. He has been thus All the day long? Rolf. All the long night and day, Since he beheld Thordisa, has he sate Locked in his turret, all access denied, Save to me only; and on me he looks As upon nothing—sees me, knows me not. Sig. Has he not spoken? Rolf. No; though once or twice I thought he named Thordisa. Sig. Let her come And look upon her work. Now, but for her, Last night had ended all; but since she came, And cast the icy shadow of her presence Upon the face of the sun, I might as well Move yon dull rock to strike the insolent waves That chatter at its base, as wake in him The spirit of his fathers. Ay, howl on! Nature herself is up in arms to-night, In censure of our paltering, and the Spirit Of Death rides forth upon the wings o' the storm To claim the craven who invoked him here, And dares not stand the challenge. Rolf. What a flash! Methought it showed me that white form again, Waiting for Harold. What a slave was I To stay his hand! I should have armed it here In triple steel against the Norman stranger, Who were more fit to die to spare an ache To Harold's finger, than my lord to fall For all the blood that waters Normandy! There may be time— Sig. Too late! The spell is on him, Which none may loose but the fell witch that wove it. Send his Thordisa here. Enter Thordisa. Tho. Who speaks of me? Lord Harold's evil spirit? Sig. Oh, fair creature, I would not claim precedence of yourself; But 'tis no time to bandy courtesies. Do you love Harold? Tho. If you love him, no. Sig. Say that I love him not, then. Only think That every storm-driven minute, as it goes, Is heavy with his life, and bid him hasten To keep the oath he swore. Tho. Bid Harold come, If my poor name has yet the charm to draw him To a brief converse. Do not answer. Go! [Exit Rolf. Sig. His life is in your hands; oh, think of that! A word from you will steel the nerveless heart— A look from you will fire the frozen spirit. Could I but rob you of the power you own To move him to your wishes, I would kill you Here where you stand, in your pale saintliness, And think the deed well done. Tho. I ask no better: It is not good to live. Sig. 'Tis ill to die. Tho. Yes; to die ill is ill; but to die well Is better than the best. Sig. Tell Hugo that; And do not rob him of so great a boon. For me, I am not enough in love with death, To court it for myself, or for my boy. What will you say to him? Tho. Leave that to me. Sig. I cannot read the purpose of your heart In that cold eye of yours. But mark me, woman! If that harm comes to Harold, you shall rue it, For I will kill you. Tho. Pagan! to your knees! And pray the Heaven, whose stern arrest you dread, To strike at others, but to spare you yet For late remorse—repentance—sorrow—shame! Talk you of killing—you, whose every word Might kill the one immortal part in you, But that it is immortal, which should make Even of that crooked form a thing more fair Than the dead glories of the universe? Thou, that hast lived for evil from thy birth, Thou, that in very wantonness of ill Hast laid this bitter sin on Harold's soul, On Harold's whom thou lovest! lovest—thou! Thou, that hast perjured him, and widowed me; Thou, that hast blighted man, and outraged God, Look on the ruin round thee—'tis thy work! Enter Harold. Sig. Harold! Har. Go in; this is no place for you, For where she is is Heaven; go forth from it. [Sigurd shrinks off. You sent for me? Tho. Yes. Har. Why? Tho. To look on you, And bid you look on me. Are you afraid? Is this the Harold whom I knew erewhile? Oh, no; for he was weak, perchance, and yielding, But he was fearless. In his eyes there shone A light that made a halo where he went, And stamped him noble in his own despite. Where is that lustre now? And where is he? This Harold is not Harold. Har. If you will, Stab me with sharp reproaches; on my head Pour all the words of love I spoke to you, Transmuted into gall; and let thine eyes, Changed more than mine, flash anger back on me, Which once had gathered all the light of love Into their magic circle. Do all this, But do not stand thus cold and passionless, As is the marble to the craftsman's hand, When he has lost his cunning, and no more Can fashion life out of the sleeping stone! Tho. Artist, you wrong yourself! Good sooth, you do! I am not marble, but poor common earth, That served as matter for your 'prentice hand To mould in plastic shapes, then throw away For work more worthy. Oh, your cunning, sir, Has grown with practice, and your latest model Has been more deftly carved of fairer stuff. She sent me to you. Har. Who? Tho. Have you forgotten Her name so soon? She is called Isabelle, And asks you for her husband. Har. You know all? That I am bound within this hour to kill him, Or pay the forfeit with my life? Tho. I know. Har. And you would have me— Tho. Pay it! Har. And be perjured! Tho. Is perjury to you so hard a thing? Har. And is my death so slight a thing to thee? Tho. Lighter than such dishonour. Oh, this deed Would top dishonour, and would underwrite My griefs against thee with so black a charge, That Mercy's self must scorn to plead for thee Before the bar of Justice. Not for me, That have no longer right or part in you, But for your soul's sake, stay your hand to-night, And let the Norman go. Har. I had no soul, Save that thou lentest me. I'll not stay my hand For such a scruple. Ask for thine own sake All that thou wilt. I'll do or leave undone Anything, everything—so thou wilt plead As thou wert wont to do. Tho. Oh, shame upon you! Do you not hear the wrath of God cry out Upon your sacrilege? Do you not see God's eye dart forth the flame to burn you up, Where self-attainted in his sight you stand? I will not plead with you as was my wont, Lest, as your wont was, you should lie to me! But I will beg the name of Isabelle; And, being Isabelle, to whom you swore, But yesterday, a truth beyond the grave, I say to you, be true but for an hour, And give me back my husband! Har. And I answer, I will not. If I love you, Isabelle,— You, Isabelle, loving me—what offering Can do such grace to us and to our love, As this your husband's blood? What blow can rivet Closer the links of our unhallowed chain, Than that which strikes him down? Tho. She loves you not, Vain-glorious boy! Think you all women are As weak as I, as easily wooed and won? With ear so ill-attuned to the rich ring Of sterling metal, as to take the dross For the pure ore, the burnished lead for gold, The churl for the knight, the lackey for the lord? She loves you not, I say! She played with you, As, had I courtly breeding, I had played, Poor puppet in her strings of fairy silk! And as thy sin, so is thy punishment! Har. Was that her message? Give her mine again. Tell her, my love was counterfeit as hers, Tell her, my passion grew but of my pain, And that one sin gave monstrous birth to another, Worse than itself! I read but in her eyes The record of mine oath, that oath which damned me Past all redemption of thy love and thee! She was the phantom of thy beauty, dear! I sought in her forgetfulness of thee, But still thy shadow overshadowed all Her ripe reality, and made the substance Seem but the seeming; when I pressed her hardest With my hot words, it was thy breath that fired them, Even with the shame it ever cried on me! Tell her I love her not! Tell her I ask Her pity and her pardon! Tell her I have One love—one life—one hope—one saviour— All called Thordisa. Do not turn away! What's Hugo now to us? or Isabelle? Come back to me, come back; I love you so, That I must wipe my sins out with that love, Had they ten times their burden. Answer me! Tho. What can I answer? Har. Kiss me! Tho. Never, never! What, are you tired of the new toy already, And would have back the old? Too late, my lord! Not all the encircling air shall breathe again Into the frozen ashes one brief spark; Or, if it seem to do so, it shall be Like will-o'-the-wisp upon a barren moor, To lure you to your death! Har. Your words are cruel; I do not know Thordisa. Tho. I myself Now know myself no longer. Oh, the sin, To change a nature that was soft and kind, To such a thing as thou hast made of me! Har. Thordisa, listen! Tho. No; between us two The words of that troth-plight are as a bar Words cannot overleap. Let Hugo go! And in His sovereign mercy may the Lord, Whose face thy guilt has covered, hold His hand, And spare you to repent. Ay, and me, too; For I had all forgot Him in my wrongs, And He is angry (muttered thunder). Do you hear Him? Hark! It is our sentence. Har. Let me meet it, then, As a man should. The ways of Him you pray to Are dark to such as I, and I am lost In their strange mazes. If, forsworn to thee, I must for thee forswear myself again, Why, I will do it! What you ask of me Is Hugo's life, and what you ask I give, Come what come may; but if I fall for him, First he shall know the truth, and on his sword I'll pay the forfeit of my broken vow, And blot dishonour out! Hugo! Enter Sigurd. Sig. Too late! Some juggling devil has been here at work. Hugo has fled. Har. Fled? Sig. How or where I know not. But he has gone: and even now the hour Draws to its fatal ending. Who has been Hell's messenger to him? Who warned him? Tho. I! Sig. The Christian witch again! nay, then all's lost! Tho. All's won, all's gained, if Heaven but gain a soul! I dared not hope that my weak voice could win The boon I asked for. For your sake, not his, I wrestled for his life; for with the morning He left the castle. He and Isabelle Are far away ere this. Har. I am dishonoured, And you have done it. Are we even now? Sig. We will be, traitress. (To Harold). Now you know the worth Of her that has ensnared you. Gone, those two, To make a sport of the northern savages Among their courtly minions. Har. Gone! Enter Hugo. Hugo. Not yet. Har. Ah! Sig. (to Harold). There is time; kill him! Tho. Oh, God, have mercy! [Hugo and Harold face each other with drawn swords. Hugo. I have learned all, young sir, from Isabelle. I will not call you knight; for in my country The man who thus, under his own roof-tree, Plots 'gainst the life and honour of his guest, And masks the face of murder and of lust With the fair-seeming smile of fellowship, If such a thing could live, must strike the spurs With his own base hand from his serpent heel, Ere dare to wear them! Oh, that one so young Should be so old a villain! Think you, sir, That I would leave this coast infested thus, Nor strive to rid it, first, of such as thou! Defend yourself. Tho. Oh, spare him! Hugo. Gentle lady, I saw you not. If you will go with us, My Isabelle shall tend you as a sister, For your kind service. Tho. For that service, spare him! Hugo. You are too true a woman not to know A true man's sacred duty. For my wife And for my honour. Leave us, I entreat. Sig. (to Thordisa). Stand by, and watch the issue of your love. Tho. What have I done? Where are you, Isabelle? [Exit. Sig. (aside). Now then, my trusty counsellor! [Half drawing his sword. Hugo. To your guard. Har. I will not fight with you. Hugo. What? Har. You have spoken The truth, and less. Yes, I have been most base; Base and unknightly. Yes, I swore to kill you, And would have done it. Yes, I would have made Your wife my mistress. But all this is nothing In my great sum of sin; for from my brow I plucked the brightest jewel of the earth And trod it in the mire. Thordisa's love I had, and lost. Look on my sword, Sir Hugo; As keen and shining was my honour once, As smooth and fair my fortune, till one day I broke them—thus. (Breaking his sword). Kill me; it is your right. [He folds his arms across his eyes. Sig. Ay, and his duty! Use it, Norman, do; And let thy hand do justice for us all On this degenerate puny stripling here, Who shames all manhood. These be your new creeds, That teach a man to write himself a cur. I'll none of them, or you, but I will go And rail my tongue out 'gainst a world that rears Nothing but mongrels. I have cared for you, That do not even care to curse at me For bringing you to this. Well, peace be with you! A Christian peace! and may all pagan plagues Be doubled in that word. Die, fool, and rot! [Exit. Har. You see me as I am, a butt for all, Good men and knaves, to shoot at; and already, If words could kill the body, as they kill The heart beyond all surgery, should I lie Mere carrion at your foot. Why do you wait? Hugo. I am no executioner, Sir Harold, Nor you the thing I thought you. On your face I read an open record fairly writ, That doth belie your fault. May Heaven forbid That I should mar its blazon! Boy, you sinned But in the thought; and standing self-condemned, You stand to me acquit. Young brother-in-arms, I do absolve you freely. Fail no more! Har. Come these words from your heart? Hugo. 'Tis in my hand, Take it. Har. Ay; with my lips, and on my knee. [Kneeling. Enter Thordisa and Isabelle. Tho. Come with me, come! Oh, lend me strength to plead; Lend me thy winning tongue, thy fairy grace, Thy mellow wiles, the blush that burns betimes, To light up worship. Come! I am so weak That thought myself so strong in scorn of him, That I would rather see him in your arms Than at your husband's foot. Isa. (smiling). Yet he is there. Hugo. Rise, Harold. Here is she to whom your knees Owe all their fealty. Tho. (drawing back). Safe! Hugo. Come, Isabelle. (To Tho.) Forgive him, lady, he is worth forgiveness. Har. (to Isabelle). First give me yours, fair Norman, and farewell; If you should think of me when you are gone, Be it as of one who died when he was young, And had not learned to live. Isa. I will think of you As of a wayward but a noble heart, Kept in such keeping, that its fitful pulse Beats with a steadier music day by day, Till age steal gently o'er its harmonies, And lull them to repose more musical Than the best concords of a jarring world. Adieu, Sir Pagan! As I think, you know The trick of lovers' vows, forget it not! You are forgiven. Sister, fare you well! [Exeunt Hugo and Isabelle. Tho. Farewell! I know not how all this may end; But as from yon black storm-cloud breaks the sky, So hope shines through thy sin. The tempest's fury Is well-nigh spent. Har. There are more clouds behind: And even their latest message teems with fires That carry death. Look! It is dark again, But through their rift the moon showed at the full, And the bell treads upon the stroke of one. My hour is come, Thordisa. I have broken That oath for thee, and I did well to break it. But turn thy face in kindness upon mine, For I shall never see it any more. Tho. It cannot be! Har. I know it. Tho. Dreams! And yet What change is on thy face! Some unseen hand Writes on its page in fearful characters Something I cannot read. Come closer to me. Har. The unknown language of the land unknown. I soon shall hear it spoken. Hark! In the air I hear it now. Tho. It is the dying storm! Har. That shall not die alone. Thordisa, listen, There is so little time. I give my life To please you—that is nothing. Where I go to You say you know—I do not—but it must be Where I shall be a stranger. Let me take Some gentle record of the place which knew me, To bear me company where I am not known, Or I shall feel so lonely. Tho. Hush! oh, hush! Har. Ay, soon I shall! Tell me—when I am gone Into that country, and the trackless hills, Which are its nearest confines, have shut out Earth's real sounds for ever, shall I not Hear for awhile the echo of my life Roll back across them, in the words that last Fell on my living ear? Tho. Harold! Har. Oh, yes! That is the sound that I would take with me! I have not heard it for so long—so long! All has been bitter here! Say that again, Say just my name! I dare not ask for more! Tho. But you shall have it! You shall have it all That heart can fashion or words imitate, For I adore you! I forgive you—no— I know that I have nothing to forgive— Nothing! It was not you that played me false! It was not you that broke your troth to me! It was your evil angel, who had drugged Your own true self to sleep, and breathed that oath Which, like the sudden blast upon the grain, Blighted the promise of our harvest time! And as it was not you, so shall not you Die for the forfeit. Har. Love! But now I can. Tho. You will not be so cruel; do not leave me Just when I find you. No, you cannot die, Shielded by such a death-proof love as mine! The bell strikes one, and the White Pilgrim appears. Both pause, chilled and horror-stricken. The Pilgrim advances. Har. (dazed). I do not know that form. Tho. Ah, God, I do! Har. (facing the Pilgrim, who has come down between them. Thordisa has fallen back.) Yes, it is coming. I am not afraid. Why, this is sleep—no worse. Who art thou, then? What is thy message? Pil. To the restless—rest! [Unveils to Harold, who sinks at her feet. Thordisa springs forward as the veil closes again. Tho. Harold! Har. Why, Death is not so hard as Life. ’Tis better so, belovèd, better so! [Dies. Tho. Oh, not alone! Dear Spirit, look on me! I know my heart is breaking—is it not? For if it were not, it were worse than stone. I must go hence; I will not stay behind! Sweet Spirit, let me not! Unite us now In the one union we may ever know— We that so loved each other! Oh, draw back The envious curtain that enfolds you both, And let me see the face behind the veil! (Triumphantly). My heart is broken! Pil. (unveiling to Thordisa). Like a tired child! [Thordisa sinks down by Harold's side. Tho. Darling, you will not be a stranger there! [Dies. The figure of the Pilgrim disappears. Enter Sigurd, Leofric, Frioth, Rolf, Gerda, and others with torches, who rush up to the figures, then stand awe-struck and silent. Gerda in Rolf's arms. The music breaks out from the Chapel in the hymn which closed the Second Act: Death here is Lord of all! Spread we the funeral pall, Hoping, not sighing! In the far land where rest Those whom God loves the best There is no dying. Curtain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OCCASIONAL POEMS. HORACE'S GHOST. (A DEDICATION.) Gentle reader—patron mine— Born of old and patient line, Some with eager zest embrace Glories of the field and chase; Covet these the athlete's prize, Guerdon meet in lady's eyes; Those, Ambition's clarion calls To the Commons' storied halls, Heart and Will by Fancy set On the star and coronet; Battle some for golden gain, Garners stored with Indian grain; Him, the wealth Golconda yields Tempts not from his father's fields, On a sea-bound bark to roam From the safety of his home; While another courts in vain Dull repose from wind and main, Praising Ease—to test anew Fragile freight and careless crew: Some the wine-cup's vigils keep; Some in busy daylight sleep By the crystal fountain's sheen, Or beneath the covert green; Blithe the soldier springs to arms, Vainly Beauty woos and charms, When the boar and tiger near Tempt the hunter's gun and spear. Godlike all our pleasures be, For the Lords of Earth are we. Ivied Muse of frolic song, Set me 'mid thy joyous throng; Do not all thy smiles deny To thy constant votary! Let me win the lowest place In thy dear and winsome grace;— Happy then, and passion-free, Earth has naught to offer me. OLD AND NEW ROME. What came we forth to see? a fair or race? Some hero fêted by an eager crowd? Or would we do some favoured princeling grace, That thus we herd so close, and talk so loud? Pushing and struggling, fighting, crushing, shouting, What are these motley gazers here to seek, Like merry-makers on a summer outing? 'Tis but the services of Holy Week. The Eternal City swarms with eager strangers From every quarter of the busy earth; Who fill the temples like the money-changers, And say some prayers—for what they may be worth. In never-ending tide of restless motion, They come to burn, in fashion rather odd, The incense of their polyglot devotion, Before the altars of the Latin God. As flock the Londoners to Epsom Races, Or form a “queue” to see the newest play, So do the pilgrim-tourists fight for places Before the chapels in their zeal to pray. From holy place to holy place they flit, To “do” as many churches as they can; And humbly kneeling, for the fun of it, They climb the ladder of the Lateran. Here some fair maid, her Heavenward journey steering, Where by Swiss bayonets the way is barred, Nor Law, nor Pope, nor Antonelli fearing— Breaks through the lines of the astonished guard. In customary suit of solemn black, With string of beads and veil à l'Espagnole, She means to “see it all;” to keep her back Would be to peril her immortal soul. There a slim youth, while all but he are kneeling, Through levelled opera-glass looks down on them, When round the Sistine's pictured roof is pealing Our buried Lord's majestic Requiem. For him each storied wonder of the globe is “The sort of thing a fellow ought to see;” And so he patronised Ora pro nobis, And wanted to encore the Tenebræ. Stranger! what though these sounds and sights be grandest Of all that on Earth's surface can be found? Remember that the place whereon thou standest, Be thy creed what it may, is holy ground. Yet I have gaped and worshipped with the rest— I, too, beneath St. Peter's lofty dome Have seen, in all their richest colours dressed, The golden glories of historic Rome; Have heard the Pontiff's ringing voice bestow, 'Mid cheering multitudes and flags unfurled, Borne by the cannon of St. Angelo, His blessing on the “City and the World;” Have seen—and thrilled with wonder as I gazed— Ablaze with living lines of golden light, Like some fire-throne to the Eternal raised, The great Basilica burn through the night; Have heard the trumpet-notes of Easter Day, Their silver echoes circling all around, In strange unearthly music float away, Stones on the lake translated into sound;— Yet would I wander from the crowd apart, While heads were bowed and tuneful voices sang, And through the deep recesses of my heart A still small voice in solemn warning rang. “Oh vanity of vanities! ye seem, Ye pomps and panoplies of mortal state, To make this text the matter of your theme, That God is little, and that Man is great. “Is this parade of the world's wealth and splendour The lesson of the simple Gospel-word? Is this the sacrifice of self-surrender Taught by the lowly followers of the Lord? “Do we, who broider thus the garment's hem, Think of the swaddling-clothes the child had on? Grace we the casket, to neglect the gem? Forget we quite the manger for the throne?” While thus in moralising mood I pondered, I turned me from the hum of men alone; And, as my vagrant fancy led me, wandered Amid the maze of monumented stone. The crowd their favourite lions now forswore, Left galleries and ruins in the lurch; The cicerone's glory was no more, For all the world was gathered in the church So at my will I strayed from place to place, From classic shrines to modern studios— Now musing spellbound, where Our Lady's The Madonna of Foligno. face In nameless godhead from the canvas glows. Now, from the still Campagna's desolate rise, I saw the hills with jealous clasp enfold The lingering sunlight, while the seaward skies Paled slowly round the melting disc of gold; Now gazed, ere yet on dome and tower had died The glory of the Roman afterglow, Over the map-like city lying wide, Half-dreaming, from the Monte Mario. Traveller, do thou the like; and wouldst thou learn How Rome her faithful votaries enthralls With all the memories that breathe and burn Within the magic circle of her walls, Leave pomp of man and track of guide-led tourist, And drink of history at the fountain-head; For living minds and living things are poorest In that vast mausoleum of the dead. There, where the stately Barberini pile Like some new Nimrod's fabric heav'nward climbs, Enduring monument of Christian guile, By outrage wrested from the Pagan times; “Quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini.” Where lulled and drowsy with the distant hum, The sentinel keeps watch upon the town, And from the heights of old Janiculum On Father Tiber's yellow face looks down; Where in their southern grace the moonbeams play On Caracalla's tesselated floors, And rescue from the garish light of day The Colosseum's ghostly corridors; Where Raphael and all his great compeers Art's form divine in giant-mould have cast, The very air is heavy with the years, The very stones are vocal of the past. Still, as we saunter down the crowded street, On our own thoughts intent, and plans, and pleasures, For miles and miles, beneath our idle feet, Rome buries from the day yet unknown treasures. The whole world's alphabet, in every line Some stirring page of history she recalls; Her Alpha is the Prison Mamertine, Her Omega, St. Paul's without the Walls. Above, beneath, around, she weaves her spells, And ruder hands unweave them all in vain: Who once within her fascination dwells, Leaves her with but one thought—to come again. So cast thine obol into Trevi's fountain— Drink of its waters—and, returning home, Pray that by land or sea, by lake or mountain, “All roads alike may lead at last to Rome.” Easter, 1869. THE WISHES OF A DUMB-WAITER. Given as a present upon a wedding-day. To circle round the “social board,” 'Mid wit and wine, I am not able; Nor, with rich fruits and dainties stored, To wait upon your dinner-table. Domestic in my tastes and ways, On humbler errand am I come; The breakfast-hour my gifts displays, The servant of a quiet home. Of my new masters I've no fears; For he, who recommends the place, Has known the worth of one for years, And reads the other's—in her face. And so, a willing drudge, I'll turn Upon my rounds without ado, And wonder at the hissing urn For waiting noisily on you. Centre of gravity sedate, I watch o'er household griefs and blisses, But hold my tongue, and never prate Either of quarrels or of kisses. Like some good commonplace M.P., I to my betters “pass the butter;” And, in my way as wise as he, Turn round and round, but never utter. My trusty counsel I can keep Whene'er my lady has the vapours; Or, fidgety from want of sleep, My master d??s the morning papers. But happier, that I never tire Of listening to the cozy chat And simmer by the new-lit fire— The pleasant talk of this and that— The morning's plan for work or play— The homely cares—the homely joys— And, on the welcome holiday, The laughter of the girls and boys. The choicest blessings of the hearth For you, through me, the sender prays, With all the good things upon earth, As health, and wealth, and length of days. Long may the “whirligig of time” For you lay its “revenges” by, And point the moral of my rhyme, By turning smoothly, as will I. God speed you then: locutus sum, And, having once the silence broken, I shall for evermore be dumb: Excuse me, please, for having spoken. LADY FAIR. Underneath the beech-tree sitting, With that everlasting knitting, And the soft sun-shadows flitting Through your wavy hair; All my thoughts and plans confusing, All my resolution loosing, Say, what matter's in your musing, Lady fair? Oh, the charm that in your face is! All the loves and all the graces! To be clasped in your embraces Were a monarch's share: Not a man, I ween, who sees you, But would give his life to please you, Yet you say—that lovers tease you! Lady fair! One by one, to their undoing, Fools in plenty come a-wooing, Baffled still, but still pursuing, Tangled in the snare: In your ever-changing smile hid, Or beneath your sleepy eyelid, Many a heart it hath beguilèd, Lady fair! While the summer breezes fan her Gently with their leafy banner, Venus' form and Dian's manner Doth my goddess wear; Lives the man who can discover Any secret spell to move her To the wish of mortal lover, Cold as fair? But to see those dark eyes brighten, And for me with kindness lighten, While the cheek's rich colours heighten, What would I not dare? To inform their scornful splendour With the love-light soft and tender, Bow the proud heart to surrender, Lady fair! By the lives that thou hast broken, By the words that I have spoken, By the passion they betoken, I have loved, I swear, Only thee since I have seen thee; And, if woman's heart be in thee, I will die, but I will win thee, Lady fair! LA VIOLETTA. Thou art my loadstar and my queen; to thee The current of my heart sets ebblessly, Tho' all unheeded the poor offering be. The soft twin-lamps that from thy fair face shine, Lit with a tenderness that's only thine, Burn ever at my fancy's inmost shrine. If I might choose my fate, I would entreat To be a carpet for thy dainty feet, When I return to that I came from, sweet; Or to be native to the southern sky, Which for thy head makes fitting canopy— A waif upon thy path to live and die. Now I but ask, for all memorial, That from thine eyes upon my grave may fall One crystal drop, to grace my funeral. And on the tomb, ere yet that dew be dried, Thus let my life's brief tale be signified— “He only prayed for her, and stood aside.” Venice, 1870. LONDON LOVES. Written just before an illness of some years. The day of parting has come, dear, The day we've delay'd so long; But the strings of my lute are dumb, dear And have lost their trick of song. I have known them the hour together Run on to the lightest theme— The fashions, the parks, or the weather, A fancy, a flower, a dream. When the mirth of life was maddest, To my hand they would leap and bound; And when darkest my mood and saddest, Would whisper their softest sound. Whenever the day was breezy, Whenever the mad moon shone, Rhyme-spinning was just as easy As loving,—and passing on. Of the garden of sweet girl-dancers If one pleased me more than the rest, And our hands, as they met in the Lancers, For a moment clung and press'd, Ere the world was another day older, I would sing her a song of love Inscribed to her round white shoulder, Or the little pink ear above. I catalogued in my ditty All her charms, with a verse for each, And vowed that her eyes were witty, If her tongue lack'd the gift of speech. O ye loves, ye loves of London, Ye hearts of its women and men, That are all in a moment undone, And sooner mended again! Ye loves of the loveless sinner, Ye loves of the box and the Row, Loves born with the oysters at dinner, And drain'd with the curacoa! Loves without ruth or scorning, I have worn you fresh and bright With my boutonnière in the morning, To die with its leaves at night. There's many a pretty person With thought-unwrinkled brow I've hung my garland of verse on, Whose name I've forgotten now. But not to such love-notes only Was I wont to tune my lute: As I willed, in my seasons lonely, 'Twas vocal for me, or mute. I loved it well, for it made me A kingdom all my own, Where never a foe could invade me, Save a halting verse alone. But to-day, when I fain would wake it To a high and tender strain, Does the spirit of song forsake it? Must I sweep its chords in vain? Sweetheart, as our voyage is ended, A chaplet I'd weave for thee Of choice thoughts cunningly blended, To wear for the love of me. But my plodding fancy lingers, Uncaught by the spark of fire, And falter my listless fingers On the nerves of the broken lyre. THESPIAN THEMES. Of all the themes of mortal dreams That make your sleep uneasy, Sure never man had sweeter than The form of Clara Vesey! That shapely limb, with ankle slim, A foot no boot can better, a Neat calf, and knee in symmetry, And fairy waist, etcetera, Across your glance will seem to dance, And at your studies tease ye, And make you swear that never were Charms like them, Clara Vesey! The wealthiest fair in Belgrave Square (Or else I little know them), Would gladly owe a plum or so, To have them, and to show them. The sagest dame of school-board fame, Of mind and mien commanding, Would give her lore and something more, For Clara's understanding; And could it ape that perfect shape (Although the thought be shocking), Would offer to the public view The whole of her blue stocking. The most sedate heads in the State, As Cardwell, Selborne, Earl Grey, Would dazzled be those gems to see, So featly cased in pearl-grey. They cannot shun comparison, For sure as eggs men call eggs, The only rage upon the stage Is legs, and legs, and more legs! They come in hose of pink and rose, In black and blue and yellow, In green and red, and turn the head Of many a simple fellow. There's long, there's short, there's every sort Of make that's been since Adam; Some girls are known to wear their own, And some believed to pad 'em. But well I wot, with pads or not, There's ne'er a one of these is (My style is gone) a “patch” upon Enchanting Clara Vesey's. My pretty page, could I engage “Supporters” half so clever, Oh, I'd behave like Geneviève, The opera of Geneviève de Brabant, very popular when this wa written. And “run” on them for ever. ÆTATE XIX. Nineteen! of years a pleasant number; And it were well If on his post old Time would slumber For Isabel: If he would leave her, fair and girlish, Untouched of him, Forgetting once his fashions churlish, Just for a whim! But no, not he; ashore, aboard ship, Sleep we, or wake, He lays aside his right of lordship For no man's sake; But all untiring girds his loins up For great and small; And as a miser sums his coins up, Still counts us all. As jealous as a nine-days' lover, He will not spare, 'Spite of the wealth his presses cover, One silver hair; But writes his wrinkles far and near in Life's every page, With ink invisible, made clear in The fire of age. Child! while the treacherous flame yet shines not On thy smooth brow, Where even Envy's eye divines not That writing now, In this brief homily I read you There should be found Some wholesome moral, that might lead you To look around, And think how swift, as sunlight passes Into the shade, The pretty picture in your glass is Foredoomed to fade. But, 'faith, the birthday genius quarrels With moral rhyme, And I was never good at morals At any time; While with ill omens to alarm you 'Twere vain to try; To show how little mine should harm you, Your mother's by! And what can Time hurt me, I pray, with, If he insures Such friends to laugh regrets away with As you—and yours? EN PASSANT. An April sun, a silver wave That laughs and breaks upon the shore— Such span to us Dame Fortune gave, One week—no more! Two barques upon the summer-foam, That meet and greet and part at sea— One outward bound, and one for home: Like them were we. A flower that blossoms in a day, And dies even there where it was born— Such was our story, you may say To-morrow morn. The how, and when, that first we spoke, I do not, and I would not, know; Dream-like the mutual fancy woke, And perished so. Yet sometimes, in this world of ours, The wave will drop a waif behind, The dream will leave a thought, the flowers A scent in mind. So may of mine abide with you, As ever shall of yours with me, A word, a smile, a look or two, A memory. WAKE, ENGLAND, WAKE! And thought we that his reign could cease? And thought we that his day was done? For that the gentle hand of Peace Had loosed the War-God's fiery zone? Wake, England, wake! let heart and hand be steady! Still for thy motto take: Ready—aye ready! A touch—a flash!—he breaks his chain, And starts to new and awful birth, To loose Hell's husbandmen amain, And sow in blood the fallow earth. This is no time for pride of pelf; This is no time to sleep or save: Britain, arise and arm thyself! Peace has no home this side the grave. Wake, England, wake! let heart and hand be steady! Still for thy motto take: Ready—aye ready! Men tell us that our arm is weak; Men tell us that our blood is cold; And that our hearts no longer speak With the rich trumpet-note of old. With threat and taunt, with scoff and sneer, They gather round the lion's den, And deem him all too deaf to hear The growing tread of armèd men. Wake, England wake! let heart and hand be steady! Still for thy motto take: Ready—aye ready! Above, around, and east and west, The storm-clouds muster swift and dark; Think we the flood of fire to breast, Safe in our isle as in the ark? The Prussian is at Paris' gates— The Prussian dons the iron crown, And marshals all the vassal States That at his mailèd foot bow down. The Russian crouches for his spring; Columbia rails in England's tongue, And waits to pierce, with mortal sting, The mighty loins from which she sprung. Wake, England, wake! let heart and hand be steady! Still for thy motto take: Ready—aye ready! Faint not nor fail, ye sons of those Who were the bravest born of men: Our nearest friends may be our foes Ere Christmastide come round again. Though praying yet for peace on earth, Keep dry your powder while you can, Forearmed to meet for home and hearth Man's message of good-will to man. Pray we that soon on every land, The reign of all the saints may come; But till its dawning, sword in hand Await we that millennium. Wake, England, wake! let heart and hand be steady! Still for thy motto take: Ready—aye ready! February, 1871. THE TWENTY-FOURTH OF MAY. In blood and fire and vapour of smoke Hidden his face, the sun sinks down— Sun, that the bright May morning woke Over a glorious godless town. The work of the centuries, warp and woof, Shrivels to dust in the breath of Hell; As winged with ruin, from roof to roof, Flashes the angel Azraël. Craven hands find the courage to slay, And starvèd bodies the life to bleed: Justice stands in her hall at bay, Hall of the “footsteps lost” indeed. Memories olden are thrown broadcast Here and there on the burning breeze; Line upon line of the storied past Falls with the falling Tuileries. Treasures of old-world art unpriced, Circled and hemmed in a flaming ring; Temples of kings and shrines of Christ: What are they that have done this thing? France! that but one brief year ago Stood as Napoleon's column stood, Towering over the world below, Mighty in boastful hardihood,— France! that riven and rent in twain, Prostrate under the pitiless skies, Fallen as ne'er to rise again, Lies as Napoleon's column lies,— Live we? breathe we? hear we aright? Is it a nightmare all men see? Is there a sun? a world? a light? God in Heaven! can these things be? What are they who have brought to birth Sights that their father-fiends appal, Till even the uttermost ends of earth Echo their ghastly carnival? Was it for this that ye called and cried For vengeance meet on the foreign foe? Was it for this that ye starved and died, Women and children, high and low? Was it for this, that men might tell, How, in the face of the Uhlan lance, Paris, unscathed by the stranger's shell, Armed her own sons to murder France? Sleeps or dreams He, the Lord of Lords? Or stands he aloof as the German stands, Watching the clash of kindred swords, With eyes unshrinking, and folded hands? Goth and Visigoth, Vandal and Hun, History's bywords, proverbs of shame, Never yet did what these have done, The People's sons, in the People's name! 1871. A HOME-SIDE STORY. She was a fair and sunny child, When first I knew her; Her winning ways my heart beguiled, And knit me to her. World-worn, and tossing on the tide And storm of life, I loved to have her at my side, My baby-wife. On fairy lore her mind I fed, And sage romances, That filled the pretty little head With earnest fancies. While as her gracious childhood grew, Shone from her eyes That wondrous light of wisdom true— Than ours more wise— Which as a lesson grave and good, And taught of Heaven, Through the pure lips of infanthood, To man is given. Drawn daily closer each to each In heart we were; But more than I to her could teach, I learned from her. We parted: I for other climes And hard endeavour To do my battle with the times, Which fight us ever. But, whether Fortune frowned or smiled, Still in my mind I kept the image of the child I left behind. She grew up on the quiet path Of homely duty, In all that mind or body hath Of grace and beauty; 'Mid her allotted joys and cares Pursued her way, But still remembered, in her prayers, For me to pray. Formed and compact of sober stuff, In simple fashion My life went on with friends enough, But strange to passion. I thought myself the common lot Of earth above; Light fancies I had known, but not— What men call Love. We met again: the budding flower, So fondly tended, Had borne at its appointed hour, A blossom splendid. Another tale on me had told The years that fled, Which, while they filled my hand with gold, Silvered my head. No need of many words to tell How then I met her; Changed as she was, I knew her well— Who could forget her? About her was some subtle sense Of sweet perfume, That, waiting on her innocence, Entered the room. The world, with all its silken ties, Closely had bound her; The young, the noble, breathed their sighs, And vows around her. Then learned I, from the sudden smart Of jealous pain, That I had found, within my heart, My youth again. I watched, if haply in her eyes I might discover, From wandering glance, or swift surprise, The favoured lover. But she was calm and kind, the while Methought was worn A something, in her friendly smile, Of quiet scorn. I stepped from out the throng: her glance Went through and through me, And gave in wordless utterance, Her welcome to me. Her very start was a caress; She did not speak; But flushed, with sudden tenderness, From brow to cheek. No thought had she of name or fame, Of rank or glory; And soon in faltering accents came The old old story. Her heart's desire was this, to share With me her life: And so I won, and so I wear My noble wife. MDLLE. CROIZETTE IN “THE SPHINX.” In a town we know (And I love it dearly), Where the painters show Pretty pictures yearly, There was one on view— If your thoughts you force back Just a year or two— Of a girl on horseback. Dainty little dame! Neat her waistie's span was; And the painter's name Carolus Duran was. Ne'er before had girls Such inviting noses, Teeth so like to pearls, Peeping out of roses. And there shone a light In the saucy eye, which Made you pass the night, Dreaming of the sly witch, Rivals scattering In a general set-to, All the spoils to bring Mdlle. Croizette to— Saying: “I adore E'en the chair you sit on; Have some pity for A distracted Briton! Lived I up a tree, Slept I in a barn, it Would be bliss with thee, Comedy incarnate!” Thus I thought of you, Prettiest of minxes! Is't the same, then, who Acting in “The Sphinx” is? Changing us to stones, Chilling all our blood in All our marrowbones, Dying on a sudden?— Turning hot to cold? Thrilling all the pit—ex- Pecting to be told Next day by the critics, In their ancient song, That—it wouldn't do; that This was much too strong;— Nothing very new that. “Surely as my wife Wears another's back-tress,” Quoth I, “on my life, You were born an actress!” And your graceful form While my greedy eyes ate, Thus my fancy warm Rhymed you, pretty Croizette! Paris, 1874. “NAY, I'LL STAY WITH THE LAD.” (In Hutton seam, No. 3, they saw two bodies, father and son, clasped together. One of the explorers knew the man, and knew that after the explosion he had been asked by one of the men afterwards rescued to go along with him to another part of the workings, and the father replied: “Nay, I'll stay with the lad.” It was the belief of the explorers that these had both died, with one or two others near, from the after-damp. They were lying peaceably, having made pillows of their jackets and clothes.—Daily News, September 11th, 1880.) “Nay, I'll stay with the lad:” Down in the deep black seam, Huddled together, dying and dead, Far from the day-world overhead, Face to face, by a sudden fate, With a horror of Night precipitate; Hidden away from the merciful Sun, The death and the burial all in one, By their fifties cut off in vain, More than a battle counts its slain; Huddled together, man and horse, In the grip of the fire-damp's watchful force— Unsung heroes of simple mould, All unchanged from the race of old, To the olden truths, with a martyr's cry, Out of the depths they testify: And never has rede been read, I deem, Nobler than that in the deep black seam, Of Love and Courage the message sad— Only, “Nay, I'll stay with the lad.” “Nay, I'll stay with the lad:” Down in the deep black seam They found him living, and strong, and sound, In spite of the terror underground; And they bade him come and live again In the light-bright haunts of living men, And once more look the sun in the face, And gladden in earth's beloved embrace. But he looked at his young boy, dead or dying, In the midst of the shattered frgments lying— Dying or dead—but powerless to move, At the help of man, or the voice of Love. And self lay dead where the child must die, And he let deliverance pass him by; He saw his duty set straight before In the love that liveth for evermore, And he put the proffered freedom behind, With never a thought of self in mind; And, to life or to death run the trackless stream, He stayed with him in the deep, black seam, And to prayer and warning one answer had, A brave one—“Nay, I'll stay with the lad.” “Nay, I'll stay with the lad:” Down in the deep black seam Once again was the story told, Old as Honour, as Poesy old; And the rugged miner, whose cares might be Something unknown to you or to me, Rather than leave his boy below, Alone in the grip of the lurking foe, Chose to die with him there and then, Rather than live with his fellow-men; Smoothed the pillow the child beneath, Turned with him to the void of Death, And to all mankind, in its strong self-love, Taught the unself proclaimed above; And whate'er his sin, and whate'er his sorrow, Chose the night without earthly morrow— Went to his Maker straight and free, And pleaded his plea courageously; For his boy he lived, for his boy he died; And the two together, side by side, Before the divine eternal Throne Had nothing to plead but their love alone; And there, perchance, from the answer prove That the greatest wisdom of all is Love. While wealth may prosper, denial dream, Life's moral is told in the deep black seam; And angels rejoice in that answer glad, And human—“Nay, I'll stay with the lad.” A SPRIG OF HEATHER. Dear Kate,—In Mr. Murray's Guide, With neat red ribbon tied together, Between two leaves I've put aside Your tiny sprig of Scottish Heather. It came to me at Berne, you know; I had it in a quiet corner Of the old terrace, as the glow Of sunset lit the Wetterhörner. While lower Earth outwearied slept, From fiery Day yet parched and torrid, O'er the snow-pillowed giants crept A lazy flush from foot to forehead; Till the grim peaks, which, cold and lone, Had faced the sun as if to flout it, Now like a row of beacons shone, Rose-red against the grays about it. They kindled up from horn to horn, And a quaint notion Fancy lent me; Methought they crimsoned as in scorn Of the poor upstart you had sent me. “The land our mighty presence fills Dame Nature's grandest mood discloses; What make you, from your baby hills, 'Mid Edelweiss and Alpine Roses? “When men have travelled, you forget, The hills they've climbed, the lakes they've rowed on, Leave little room for them to set Much store by Lomond or by Snowdon! “What next?”—it was the biggest spoke; A mighty avalanche shook his quarters; He cracked his glaciers at the joke, And shouted in a roar of waters. I hung my head, and, half in shame, I looked upon your tiny token; When out of it an answer came, As clearly as the first had spoken. The little flow'ret seemed to wear Upon its leaf a look defiant, And to throw back with interest there His scorn upon the scornful giant. “You overgrown unsightly mass, (Rude challenge breeds uncivil answer), Learn, in your innermost crevass, It isn't size that makes the man, sir! “I come from lands of fern and heath, Which smell so sweet, and look so tender, When the long kiss of Autumn's breath Has fanned them to a blush of splendour, “That every puny half-starved flower Which aches upon your iron bosom, Would give that honour for an hour Upon those laughing slopes to blossom, “Or nestle in their grasses rare, Like jewels in a woman's tresses; While you were born as bald, you were, As any head that Truefitt dresses! “If salt is good, then how thrive you, Aloft there in your frigid snow-zone, Where the best wind that ever blew Bears not a breath of Ocean's ozone? “I bring you from the farther North A sauce your meal of ice to savour; A single whiff of Clyde and Forth Gives all your air a finer flavour! “Be more polite another day:”— The mountains held their tongues and whitened; But for my life I couldn't say If they were most amused or frightened. On the bold messenger I smiled— “True offspring of the British nation, As for the sauce you bring, my child, You've quite enough for all creation. “'Tis rarely that the sage, I wis, With any party on his oath sides, But holds, as I do now, there is A good deal to be said on both sides. “Whiche'er the better cause has shown, Old Scotland or the land of Tell-come, You've one advantage all your own— Kate sent you, and you're very welcome!” Berne, August, 1873. IN TWO WORLDS. Under the forest, of its snows unladen, And kissing back the nervous kiss of Spring, I sit and dream of courtly knight and maiden, And old-world pomp encompassing a King. Out of her wintry sleep the Earth is waking, And birds and flowers carol her réveillée; O'er East and West the common promise breaking, Breathes the first whisper of their holiday. Without, the mighty forms of things primæval Stand all untenanted of Custom's robes; Within, my mind shapes pictures mediæval, With pencil fashioned forth in other globes. The rugged miners share my board and pillow, And by the camp-fire sing their lawless song; But at a bound my thought o'errides the billow, And breasts the strong surf by a flight as strong. What do I here among the waving grasses, Which never learned to trim their graces wild? While by my side Nature's rude army passes, Another world still claims me for her child. In vain I ply the axe in pass or clearing; In vain I fill me with the unfettered air; Still to my eyes are other scenes appearing, Still my heart hearkens the low voice of Care. Among our ranks no woman comes to harm us, And sow us discord for our hands to reap; No wiles and jars allure us or alarm us, Or wanton with the mighty arm of Sleep. Yet here, for me, though heart and will are master, As strong as Iron and as calm as Death, The will will waver and the heart beat faster, Touched by the memory of a woman's breath. Why are ye here, rude fellows of my labour, Thus outlawed from the bounds of woman's reign? Read I, beneath the swart hues of my neighbour, Another story of another pain? She said she loved me; and one day she left me, Without a warning and without a word; Of past and present at a blow bereft me; The cause unspoken, and the plea unheard. Behind me honour, and high hopes before me— A life of earnest and a name of worth; Her glamour shed the bright delusion o'er me; Her presence kept the promise of my birth. Then fell the blow, and past and future shivered, Just at a fairy finger's heartless touch; And from the bondage of a lie delivered, I laughed that I had trusted overmuch. Laughed! and the echo of that hollow laughter Rings in my heart with one eternal knell; And the slow years which rolled their burden after, With all the burden cannot crush the spell. Pines of the Sierras, spread your mantles round me, And hide me from the past, untrodden West! Oh that the free lands and free souls which bound me, Could break the fetters of my prisoned breast! In vain, in vain! Not the dividing ocean, With all its storms one memory can drown; While the vexed phantom of a lost devotion, Still in the tortured bosom dies not down. Up, and to work! The western spring invites me, And freedom calls me forth among the free: But no! Nor work nor freedom here delights me, The Eastern bondage falls again on me. PEACE—AND HONOUR. Ode to the Memory of Lord Beaconsfield. (APRIL 19TH, 1881.) Hushed are the sounds of party strife In reverence round the quiet bed, As all the busy stream of Life Seems stayed beside one spirit fled: And England sends the message on, To West and East—A great man gone. Strange power of Death! Once laid on him With gentlest touch her royal hand, Unbidden tears the eyes bedim, And manliest hearts are half unmanned. Our little discords melt and cease; He lies in Honour—and at Peace. Yes—honoured in the hearts of those Who would his living purpose cross, By the world's law of friends and foes, Suspended in a country's loss; While for his peace may no man spare His tribute to the country's prayer. Strange power of Death! How small they seem, Our quarrels, grudges—all put by, The baseless fabric of a dream, Beside the great reality. We read, ere yet the clay be cold, In deaths like this, Death's secret told. As to her breast the generous sea River and rivulet draws in, Till all the parted streams that be In that maternity are kin, Even so the pale Magician charms All minds, all wisdoms, to his arms. He, but a few short days ago Held in a nation's half mistrust, Here feared, there followed, lying low, Where all may trample on his dust, Lies safe with laurels round his brow— His party's then, his England's now. Strong loves he conquered on his way, Strong as the enmities he woke, And the loosed passions of the day In praise and anger round him broke: Anger and enmity o'erthrown, Death has for sister—Love alone. Men called him alien, deemed him set On dreams of empire not of ours, And prone true empire to forget In the long clash of jarring powers: But England's 'scutcheon blazons still The motto of his life—I will. In steady purpose, steady toil, He followed, and he won the prize, Which through the senate's fierce turmoil Lighted, but dazzled not his eyes; Nor rank nor fortune smoothed the course; He dared, and conquered, and by force. As patient as the great should be, As watchful as the purposed are, He marked power's ebbing, flowing sea, Now sparkling near, now murmuring far, Till with strong hand he grasped the helm, Through storm and shine to steer a realm. And when, life's threescore years and ten In the long passage overpast, He yielded up the helm again, He stood as steady to the last: Not Cæsar's robe, when Cæsar died, Was folded with a calmer pride. Calmly he gave the reins of State, As first he held them, self-possessed; And undismayed, as unelate, Turned to the love once loved the best, And wooed, from strife of tongues apart, The Muse of Story to his heart. So, England's Minister, good-night! Nor praise nor blame can touch thee now; Safe from the fierce and public light Which beat upon thy vessel's prow: Thy place is with the great alone, Not one's, nor other's. England's own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS AND BALLADS. A LIFE'S REGRET. Turning the leaves in an idle way Of a book I was skimming the other day, I found a line at the end of a song, Which keeps on haunting me all day long With its sweet and mournful melody; “O love, my love, had you loved but me!” Sadder a burden could never be Than “Love, my love, had you loved but me!” Few words and simple; but oh, how much The singer has told in that little touch! How hard a story of chances lost, Of bright hopes blighted and true love crossed, Is heard in the whispered melody; “O love, my love, had you loved but me!” To many a sorrow the key may be That “Love, my love, had you loved but me!” I don't believe in what poets have said Of hearts that are broken and lives that are dead; Lives well ordered will stand to their course, And hearts of true metal ring little the worse, But they vibrate still to that melody; “O love, my love, had you loved but me!” My life is well; but what would it be, Sweet “Love, my love, had you loved but me!” The world rolls on and the years roll by, Day-dreams vanish and memories die; But it surges up with a restless pain. That fond lost longing ever again, Breathed in the passionate melody; “O love, my love, had you loved but me!” It might have been, but it cannot be! Yet “Love, my love, had you loved but me!” SPINNING-WHEEL SONG. Flash, shuttle, through the loom, Warp and woof blending; Crooning, from room to room, Songs never ending. What sighs my wheel to me In the night season? Love still the burden be, Love, and unreason. Wheel, whisper in mine ear Tales of true lovers; Clear is thy note, and clear What it discovers. Sing, how a maiden bright Cannot be lonely, If she talk day and night, With her wheel only. Flash, shuttle, whisper, wheel, Humming and turning! Secrets of eld reveal, Scraps of love learning! Tell me my heart is near, Bid me not sorrow; Tell me he will be here With me to-morrow. “RUBY WINE AND ROSY LIP.” Ruby wine and rosy lip I have quaffed and press'd; Nor, while each in turn I sip, Know I which is best. Tell me which is most divine, Ruby lip or rosy wine? When the glass alone I hold, Doubtful is the bliss; For although it cannot scold, Yet it cannot—kiss. Tell me which is most divine, Rosy lip or ruby wine? When I drink but woman's eyes, Partial is the joy; What if there no poison lies, Woman may be-coy! Tell me which is most divine, Ruby lip or rosy wine? Both at once do best engage All my heart, in sooth, If the wine be crowned with age, And the lip with youth. Both alike are most divine, Rosy lip and ruby wine! Ruby wine and rosy lip Give, my love, to me; Happy to my finger's tip By my trust in thee. True love only makes divine Ruby lip and rosy wine. MY SECRET. I would not breathe my darling's name To sea below, or sky above; To Nature's spies I'll ne'er proclaim The golden secret of my love. In vain the stream its murmur stills, That secret from my breast to steal, And lurks amid the treacherous hills, If echo might her name reveal. In vain the wind mine ear deceives, Hushed its rude voice in whisper low, Eavesdropping through the tell-tale leaves To hear her praises as I go. The image in my soul enshrined Lip-service of the best would shame; To babbling stream, or wanton wind, I will not breathe my darling's name. SERENADE. Sleep, dear, sleep! Such eyes as those, love, Burn so brightly all the day, That they need the night's repose, love, To be trimmed, and put away. If the vestal soul they shine in Always lit the flame should keep, What should I find air for mine in? Sleep, dear, sleep! Dream, dear, dream! Thy thoughts by day, love, Thy sweet will may rule and guide; Slumber-winged, they fain must stray, love, To thy constant lover's side. In the sleeper's fields Elysian They can find no better theme— If I mingle with thy vision, Dream, dear, dream! Wake, dear, wake! The sun is high, love, And outburns the morning star; Only in the eyes of my love, Shines a glory purer far. Brighter than the sunrise splendour, When the day's first blushes break, Is the love-light true and tender; Wake, dear, wake! HORATIAN ODE. (AN IMITATION.) Helvellyn's height with snows is white, The forest branches bow and splinter; No ripple breaks the frozen lakes, Then shut my door on Cold and Winter. On my hearth-dogs pile up the logs— Pile high, my boy; and down your throttle Right freely pour my “thirty-four,” And never spare the old man's bottle. Leave all the rest to him who best Knows how to still the roar of Ocean; To calm the wind in wildest mind, And hush the leaflet's lightest motion. Fear not to stay upon the day, And count for gain each happy pleasure; Be not above the game of Love, And featly tread the Christmas measure. Let blood run cold when life grows old, Stick now to skate and tennis-racquet, Till westward-ho the sun-wheels go, Then join the sports of frock and jacket. When bright eyes smile, laugh back the while, And find the nook where Beauty lingers; Steal golden charm from rounded arm, Half-given, half-held, by fairy fingers. VENETIAN BOAT-SONG. The boatmen are calling, “Stalì—stalì!” Stalì—Già è: the cries of the Venetian gondoliers. The glory is falling On me—on me! The sunlight is shaking The bay—the bay! Then up and be waking; “Già è—già è!” Stalì—Già è: the cries of the Venetian gondoliers. In Venice the golden, To dream—to dream, With love-stories olden, For theme—for theme! The blue sky above her Fair sea—fair sea, Laughs light on the lover; “Stalì—stalì!” The waves are her highways, So deep—so deep! The waters her byways, Asleep—asleep! No stir in the air is, No sound—no sound, Save footsteps of fairies, Around—around! The clouds of the hazy Forenoon—forenoon, Sleep over the lazy Lagoon—lagoon! About us a glamour Doth move—doth move, The sense to enamour Of love—of love! The Doges are perished, And gone—and gone; The sea-bride they cherished, Laughs on—laughs on! We pass through Death's portal, As they—as they; Like her, Love's immortal! “Già è—già è!” The pride of the nations, “Stalì—stalì!” That hath for foundations The sea—the sea, Was made for a home, dear, For you—for you; Then why should we roam, dear, We two—we two? MARIAN MAY. Marian May was our hamlet's pride, Worthy a queen to be, For of all the maids in the country-side Was none so fair as she. Her hair was like silk and her eyes like wine, Liquid and dark and deep; They sparkled and danced in the broad sunshine, Or melted in rosy sleep. Lovers by scores for her white hand sighed, Of high and of low degree, And many came riding from far and wide, Her sweethearts fain to be. The squire had plenty of golden store, Such as for him was meet; And he wished no better, and asked no more, Than to lay it all at her feet. But she put his gifts and his vows aside, Laughing, and out spake she: “I never was born for a rich man's bride, So I cannot mate with thee.” The parson he came, with his face so grave, Gentle and sleek and prim, And said the best way her soul to save Was to take and marry him. But she only opened her eyes full wide, Wondering, and quoth she: “Were there never a man in the world beside, You'd be far too good for me!” The colonel he swore a right round oath: “Little one, be my wife! I've scars and a pension enough for both, If you'll share a soldier's life.” He vowed that he would not be denied, Low on his bended knee; But she tossed her head with a pretty pride, Said: “I never will wed with thee!” Robin came back from the sea one day, Out of the distant West; And the child with whom he used to play, A woman he clasped to his breast. She sobbed and kissed, and she laughed and cried: Welcome, my love,” said she; “For woe or for weal, and whate'er betide, I will fare the world through with thee!” ST. VALENTINE'S TOUR. St. Valentine jumped from his narrow bed, And he gave a sleepy stare; And the good old saint he gaily said, “It's a very long time that I've been dead, And I want a change of air. “The world has been taking my name in vain For many a bygone day; And though all these years in the earth I've lain (O Lord! what a sharp rheumatic pain!) They chatter of me alway. “The lad to his lassie still once a-year Sends pictures of me by post; The clodhopper woos his village-dear With a portrait grinning from ear to ear, And the beautiful countess expects to hear, The soft things she likes the most. “I've slept so long that I guess by this I've slept back my youth divine; My birthday rights no more I'll miss, But I'll wake some pretty girl up with a kiss, And make her my Valentine.” So up he rose, and he wrapped him round With whatever came to hand; He saw that his flesh was firm and sound, (For they had embalmed him in holy ground), But he felt so cramped that the thing he found The hardest was how to stand. But saints are not puzzled their legs to mend, And laugh at such trifles small; He got to back him a Hebrew friend, And he walked for a twelvemonth, straight on end, Round the Agricultural Hall. As he walked he slept, as he walked he dined, And he walked all night and day! While a she South African, strong of mind, (But as ugly as you might wish to find), Was walking the other way. For his every mile she her twain would do, And fondly on him winked she; But though he was dead, the old saint knew What well might be called a thing or two, And, thought he, “Though I'm good enough for you, So are not you for me!” He flies to the maidens of Spiers and Pond, And thinks, as their drinks he quaffs, “Of bar-room Hebes I am not fond, So I'll stroll up the streets of the Regent and Bond, And look at the photographs.” Fair Myra de Vaux from the window-pane Shot straight at his heart below: He rushed to see her at Drury Lane, But found that the shaft had sped in vain; For, alas! her modicum of brain Was all in the shop-windowe. The rose of fashion—the sweet May Fayre, The twin photographer's pet— To the giddy world did the saint repair, And she danced a cotillon with him there; But he thought her (which made St. Valentine swear) The stupidest girl he met. So he hied him away from London vast, And off to the country went; To the brawny North he journeyed fast, By a swift express on his road he passed, (And they merrily told him that the last Had met with an accident). St. Valentine sought in every place, And he had not wandered far, Ere he saw two sisters of Irish race, One dark and the other fair of face, But like in feature, and pure in grace, As Irish maidens are. A red and white rose on a common stem, And the saint he looked and smiled; For he saw to the honest heart of them, And knew that never a brighter gem Was set in a regal diadem Than either pretty child. The mark of toil the young faces wore, For they toiled for daily bread; But the good saint laughed: “My search is o'er, Your guardian I to the better shore: My Valentines ye for evermore:” 'Twas thus St. Valentine said. READY, AY, READY. Arranged as a song from the verses at p. 109. Old England's sons are English yet, Old England's hearts are strong; And still she wears her coronet Aflame with sword and song. As in their pride our fathers died, If need be, so die we; So wield we still, gainsay who will, The sceptre of the sea. England, stand fast; let hand and heart be steady; Be thy first word thy last: Ready, ay, ready! We've Raleighs still for Raleigh's part, We've Nelsons yet unknown; The pulses of the Lion-Heart Beat on through Wellington. Hold, Britain, hold thy creed of old, Strong foe and steadfast friend, And still unto thy motto true, Defy not, but defend. England, stand fast; let heart and hand be steady; Be thy first word thy last: Ready, ay, ready! Men whispered that our arm was weak, Men said our blood was cold, And that our hearts no longer speak The clarion-note of old; But let the spear and sword draw near The sleeping lion's den, His island shore shall start once more To life with armèd men. England, stand fast; let heart and hand be steady; Be thy first word thy last: Ready, ay, ready! SIR PAUL'S DAUGHTER. Sir Paul had a daughter as fair and as fine As woman has been till now, Her eye flashed dark as a flagon of wine, And white as new milk was her brow; Her life was so rare she had never a care, Save to foot it in bower and in hall; Every day lovers new like the blackberries grew For the daughter of old Sir Paul. Her wit flashed as keen as a scimitar's blade, When carried in Moslem hand, And love, still love, was her only trade, And her only whim command. But woe, oh woe! to the captured foe, The wooer who came at her call, For she pierced the heart with a deadly dart, Did the daughter of old Sir Paul. Her love and her wit like the lightning shone, All bathed in a colour warm; But blighted and struck where they fell anon With the breath of the cruel storm. Oh, dire was the ruth of the favoured youth, Who for her gave soul and all! For man or for boy it was death to toy With the daughter of old Sir Paul. BRIAN BORU. King Brian Boru was a monarch so bold, He dressed cool in the heat, and dressed warm in the cold! Sure never his equal on earth has been seen For washing potatoes in kegs o' potheen; When tired of the state and its manifold care, Oh, he'd take his shillelagh to Donnybrook Fair, With great condescension he'd join in the fun, Break the heads of his subjects as if he was one, And look such a darlin' that nobody knew Whether he was St. Pathrick or Brian Boru. King Brian Boru was a monarch so sly, That he'd catch all the girls wid a wink of his eye! He was neat, he was sweet, he was straight, he was big, But never so great as when dancin' a jig; He danced like a fairy that weighs twenty stone, As the kings and the leprochauns trip it alone, For he was a man of a wonderful kind, And left several million descendants behind, Till divil a one of the progeny knew Who owned the succession of Brian Boru. King Brian Boru had red hair to the taste, Which in beautiful ringlets hung down to his waist! He had eyes just as green as me favourite cat, Which when he was angry got greener than that: Oh, an elegant vision was Brian to see, Wid a crown on his head and a wench on his knee! In one hand the sceptre, in t'other the bowl: May the angels sing rest to His Majesty's sowl, And remark to soft music that never they knew Such a broth of a boy as King Brian Boru!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PARODIES, ETC. THE TOWN OF NICE. (MAY, 1874.) The town of Nice! the town of Nice! Where once mosquitoes buzzed and stung, And never gave me any peace, The whole year round when I was young! Eternal winter chills it yet, It's always cold, and mostly wet. Lord Brougham sate on the rocky brow, Which looks on sea-girt Cannes, I wis', But wouldn't like to sit there now, Unless 'twere warmer than it is; I went to Cannes the other day, But found it much too damp to stay. The mountains look on Monaco, And Monaco looks on the sea; And, playing there some hours ago, I meant to win enormously; But, tho' my need of coin was bad, I lost the little that I had. Ye have the southern charges yet? Where is the southern climate gone? Of two such blessings, why forget The cheaper and the seemlier one? My weekly bill my wrath inspires; Think ye I meant to pay for fires? Why should I stay? No worse art thou, My country! on thy genial shore The local east-winds whistle now, The local fogs spread more and more; But in the sunny south, the weather Beats all you know of put together. I cannot eat—I cannot sleep— The waves are not so blue as I; Indeed, the waters of the deep Are dirty-brown, and so's the sky: I get dyspepsia when I dine— Oh, dash that pint of country-wine! MATILDA. Shall I fret and fume and swear, Because Matilda dyes her hair? Or make pale my cheeks with care, That hers so very rosy are? Though her raven locks to-day Turn as yellow as the hay, If she be but true to me, What care I how blonde she be! Shall a woman's weakness move Me such weakness to reprove? Or her little failings known Make me careless of my own? Though her bills be longer than Bill of duck or pelican, If they be not paid by me, What care I how long they be? If her youth be left behind, Shall I play the fool and mind? She must be, the women say, Forty-five if she's a day— But I swear she looks no more, At the most, than forty-four: If she's young enough for me, What care I how old she be? Be she painted, fast, or old— Be she flirt, or rake, or scold— She has cash enough to make Me submissive for her sake: If she lose her money, though, I can scorn and let her go; If in poverty she be, She may go to Bath for me! ANGOT-MANIE. Air: “Très jolie—peu polie!” On Pyrenean mountains, On Margate's shrimpy sands, Where Rhine's melodious fountains Roll down their German bands; By many a rushing river, By Neva, Thames, and Seine, Will none mine ears deliver From that eternal strain? “Très jolie— Peu polie:” Nothing else where'er I go! Oh, the bore of it! Please, no more of it! Save me from the Dame Angot! Men will not sing the old songs; Their name is never heard; For months they haven't sold songs, But that familiar word: John, Thomas, Jane, and Mary, Maid, matron, man, and boy, The minstrel from the prairie, The grinder from Savoy, Shout that ditty in Every city, in Every street and every show; Put a stopper u- Pon that opera! And destroy the Dame Angot! 'Frisco, whose portals golden Let in the golden west, And all the cities olden, And all the modernest: New York, Old York, and Cadiz, Coomassie, Brixton, Bray, Ring with the market ladies' Refrain all night and day! Oh, ye deities! In each key it is; Flute, and organ, and also Pianoforte tune Up that naughty tune— Save us from the dame Angot! Paris, 1874. THE CRUISE OF THE SIX HUNDRED. “The struggle between the labourers in Kent and the farmers who locked them out has ended in the men's departure for New Zealand. The men, it will be remembered, struck against a reduction of wages, and were then locked out till they should abandon the Union. The farmers believed that, under the pressure of the hard times, they would yield; but the younger men determined to emigrate, and introduce into the colony the cultivation of Kentish hops. The Government of New Zealand, which prefers this class of emigrants to all others, readily agreed to assist them, and on Wednesday six hundred emigrants, most of them young men, the pick of the country-side, started from Maidstone for the Antipodes. . . The men, according to the Daily News, all plead the absence of any prospect of “getting on.”—Spectator, Feb. 1, 1879. Half a life, half a life, Half a life plundered; As for the wage of death Strove the six hundred. “Seaward,” at last they said, “Seaward our lines are laid!” Out of the land of death Sailed the six hundred. “Doubt here and dull dismay, Yonder the dawn of day; England has blundered, Ours not her mission high, Ours not to ask her why, Ours but to toil and die.” Out of the land of death Sailed the six hundred. Home-ties in heart of them, Home-ties in love of them, Home-ties among them Severed and sundered. “Boots not our pain to tell, Life for a doit we sell:” So with a long farewell Sailed the six hundred. Bent every knee in prayer, Rose every sigh in air: “If there be plenty there, Long have we wondered.” Dream-bound their misery spoke, And with a start they woke; So the hard spell they broke— Broke the six hundred. “Have we no birthright dear? Have we but masters here? Ever in failing fear Trodden and plundered. Soldiers may die and bleed, Slain for the devil's creed— Ours to be free indeed!” Cried the six hundred. Mourn, then, our banished sons; Man, then, our newest guns, Speed these our gallant ones From the land sundered; Honour their hopeful heart, Honour as they depart; God bless the seaward start Of the six hundred! AD AQUÆ POTORES. A miracle of love divine Changed all the water into wine: Save me from miracles of men, Who want to change it back again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RHYMES FOR THE TIMES. A WINTER'S TALE. (SEE HORACE, BOOK I. ODE II.) The wretched world has had enough Of snow and ice, and quantum suff, Altogether, Of floundering over field and park, And shivering through the light and dark, And vain petitions to the clerk Of the weather. I try to keep the cold at bay, By storing brandy night and day In my cupboard; And every pretty girl I meet Wants to avoid me in the street, Because her nose is red, and feet India-rubbered. Man likes his skating for a bit, But grows a little tired of it; Si sic semper, Although both amiable and mild, And very gentle from a child, It strikes me that I may get riled In my temper. Next must the times return again, When on the wooden heads of men Down there fell huge Torrents of rain—the largest out, As Yankees say—in fact, about The worst recorded waterspout, Called the Deluge? Then did the globe, they say, become A sort of large Aquarium, And their senses The finned and feathered tribes forsook; The thrushes swam by hook or crook, And all the little fishes took All the fences. If Father Thames should overflow His banks for just a month or so? And unsparing Of Beauty's self, upset the King-ston Waterworks, that lovely thing, Or the fair bridge to ruin bring Down at Charing! Whom shall we call on to assuage The Winter-God's resistless rage, Even while foemen Of savage race destroy the flower Of England's youth, and all the power Of Evil round us seems to lower? Absit omen! The good Sir Walter's moral ran, How swift and sure from Folly man Into Sin goes; Kind Heaven, the cup of Reason mix, And save us from the conjuring tricks, And blood-and-thunder politics Of the Jingoes! February, 1879. HÄCKEL OF JENA. (A dinner was given last night to Professor Häckel of Jena by French savants. In his speech, as reported in the Temp, he expressed gratification at the progress of evolutionist ideas among French men of science, and remarked that professors and preachers who ridiculed man's descent from the ape unwittingly furnished the best proof of it, their pride and childish vanity being foibles which might have been bequeathed by the ape. Man, however, did not descend from any known anthropoid, but was a branch of the catarhine monkeys of the Old World. The continuity of nature was daily becoming more evident, and superstition, mysticism, and teleology would give way to reason, causality, and mechanism. Among philosophic minds, at least, the believers in final causes of the universe, immutability of species, sterility of bastards, geological cataclysms, successive creations, and the late appearance of man were dying out. The primitive life-organisms were formed chemically by spontaneous generation at the bottom of the sea, like saline crystals in water. Nohow else could the origin of life be explained. Lamarck and Darwin had struck the last blow at the doctrine of final causes, and modern morphology was irreconcilable not only with the dogma of the Creation, but with that of Providence, or the vague idealist pantheism of Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Hartmann. The transformation of living organisms under the influence of adaptation, hereditary selection, and struggle for existence could not, indeed, be mathematically demonstrated, but its existence could not be doubted any more than psychology or social science, and anomalies would soon be explained by the laws of mechanics were all the elements procurable; but the instability of the elements constituting the tissue of organised beings made biological problems very complex. The speech was much applauded.—Times Paris correspondence, 30th August, 1879.) Power to thine elbow, thou newest of sciences! All the old landmarks are ripe for decay; Wars are but shadows, and so are alliances; Häckel of Jena's the man of the day. All other ologies want an apology; Bread's a mistake—science offers a stone; Nothing is true but anthropobiology: Häckel of J. Pronounced Yay, or it wouldn't be German. understands it alone. Häckel the real evolutionist teacher is, Licking morphology clean into shape: Lord, what an ape the professor or preacher is, Ever to doubt his descent from an ape! “Children are you in your pride and your vanity, If you can laugh at a word that I say; Naught in the world but the sheerest insanity Questions my apehood,” quoth Häckel of J. “Man's an anthropoid (he cannot help that, you know), First evoluted from Häckels of old; He's but a branch of the catarh-ine cat, you know— Monkey, I mean—that's an ape with a cold! “Daily is Nature's revealed Conte-inuity Pulling Causality's nose into joint; All Teleology's but incongruity (What it all means is not now to the point). “Species loses its immutability; Minds philosophic see naught in a cause; Bastard Sterility's mere imbecility: Häckel's remarks must be taken as laws. “Fast dying out are man's later appearances, Cataclysmitic geologies gone— Now of Creation completed the clearance is: Häckel of J. you must anchor upon. “Primitive Life-Organisms were chemical, ‘Busting' spontaneous under the sea; Purely subaqueous, panaquademical, Was the original Crystal of Me! “I'm the apostle of mighty Darwinity (Stands for Divinity—sounds much the same), Apo-theistico-Panasininity Only can doubt whence the lot of us came. “Down on your knees, Superstition and Flunkeydom; Can't you accept my plain doctrines instead? What is so simple as primitive Monkeydom, Born in the sea with a cold in its head? “Häckel's the man! but whatever the issue of This comprehensible practical creed, Still I'm afraid the demonstrable tissue of Organised beings is complex indeed!” Häckel was silent; they loudly applauded him, Highly commended his utterance tall; All evolution respectfully lauded him— Then it was over. What came of it all? WH?STL?R v. R?SK?N. ON A CERTAIN CAUSE CÉLÉBRE, 1879. Thy Wh?stl?r's wrath, to Art the unfathomed spring Of woes on woes, æsthetic goddess, sing! Sing how he battled, that Columbian bold, For outraged symphonies in black and gold; His puny critic in full court would meet, And laid his wrongs before the judgment-seat. Should he, in might before his easel set, Outwork the rapid hand of Tintoret? Lend with a touch to Chelsea's glowing skies A richer hue than Titian's mightiest dyes? Out-Raphael Raphael in a blaze of power? Bid canvas live for ever in an hour? For Beauty's sake defy heraldic rules, And quarter scarlet on a field of gules? And pour before a world tradition-sated, In strains profuse, art unpremeditated? Should he do this, and more, yet knuckle down Before a hireling scribbler's venal frown? “Never,” quoth he, “by the mispainted sun, In earth or heaven shall such foul wrong be done! Forbid it, Law; forbid it, H?ddl?st?n! What though the Forty, whom my soul abhors, Against my genius bar their envious doors? Time-serving slaves, unfit to black the boots Of my large-hearted patron, great Sir C—tts! What though T?m T?yl?r, Punch's showman small, Compare my tints to paper on the wall? What though B?rn? J?n?s, the imperceptive wretch, Call my best ‘nocturne’ an unfinished sketch? What though to R?sk?n's ignorant pretence Better than I have bent in deference, Whose stones of Venice, with precision hurled, Break half the heads of the artistic world? Though all beside submit to his abuse,— Professor G?ldw?n Sm?th be dubbed a goose; Fair M?rt?n?u, the famed agnostic belle, A vulgar and a foolish infidel; Though all his lightnings play and thunders roll Round the white head of unrepressed Sir C?l?e, Let me but pay the necessary fee, Writ down a coxcomb Wh?stl?r ne'er shall be! Art of the future, bid these minions blush; Behold in me the W?gn?r of the brush! Would that my fist around their orbs of view Might paint choice symphonies in black and blue! In Art's fair name drive we these penmen back, Down with their discords dire in white and black; Come forth, ye twelve, palladium of the free, Who settle everything when ye agree, And solve all knotty points with sure precision, From High Art to an omnibus collision; Come forth, and bravely do your fearless part, Avenge in me this outrage upon Art; And be our golden Yankee rule confest, Whate'er is quickest done is done the best.” Spirits of Pope and Johnson, where ye sleep, Call grinning Bathos from the vasty deep. In melting tones the guileless P?rry spoke, And neck and heels the Judge dragged in his joke; The General Attorney for the Crown Brought for the nonce his oratory down From all the high disputes of moneyed men To this ignoble strife 'twixt pot and pen; The wigs wagged all around the smoke-dried court, And of the suitors made their usual sport; Then, when my lord would by his twelve abide, For “much was to be said on either side,” Amid the breathless silence of the house, The legal mountain bore its youngest mouse, And laid the damages to Art (if any, In pleaders' phrase) at one-fourth of a penny. RORKE'S DRIFT. Nine hundred gone. Broad seas of Time O'er a deaf world have surged and rolled, Since the first lowly Christmas chime Rang out its note of virgin gold. Peace came two thousand years ago— Man would not greet her. Be it so. O fools and blind! Light from on high The humble soul illumines still; But doth all purer rays deny To hearts full swollen in selfish will, Though flashes, ever and anon, Heaven's warning down. Nine hundred gone. Fond dreamers they, whom visions nursed Of peaceful cures for human woes: When the black cloud of battle burst Over the sad Crimean snows, Had forty winters welcomed in Peace, as if Christendom were kin. Alas, how oft on England's heart Palled those brief years of tranquil life! How would our wakeful passions start At every sound of distant strife; Answer each cry of disaccord, And whet for war the ready sword! O'erpampered with each peaceful glory, Won, step by step, through toil and skill, We traced our fathers' martial story, And would not hear the “Peace, be still!” The angel sighed and fled from men; And angry Battle reigned again. Ay, reigned indeed: from shore to shore His devilish triumphs have been won; And Statecraft rises, as of yore, To mar what better hands have done; Till sudden as the trump of doom, War claims of her his hecatomb. Ye lords and rulers of the State, Secure in all your place and pride, Think of the homes left desolate, Think of the heroes who have died; And pause, ere mad Ambition's race Makes very Mercy veil her face. What is't to us if others rave, When England lays her weapons down? The island-queen, who ruled the wave, Wears still the iron in her crown; Full as of old the life-blood runs Through the great hearts of England's sons. Not in the days of bow and spear, And deadly counter hand to hand— God bless them!—Knew they less of fear Than when, with small undaunted band, Our Bromhead faced that savage fight From dark to dawn, through Afric night. Still tremble on the verge of death The hearts that hang on news from sea; Still hold we back the passionate breath, In silent cry on bended knee; The souls that pray, pray yet the more; Down, ye that never prayed before! Pray Heaven, that yet with humbled heart The eternal lesson we may learn, That statesman's craft and statesman's art To smaller things than dust return; And blessings new our land shall bless, Whose strength should be in quietness. “POSTE RESTANTE.” FROM SIR ST?FF?D N?RTHC?TE TO LORDS B?C?NSF?LD AND S?L?SB?RY. My Lords B. and S., on a day coming round, I shall wish myself several miles underground; And i feel far from well as the turn we approach So fatal to many a cabinet coach, When politics Tory and politics Whig, And we Ministers small and you Ministers big, And schemes for the good of the land we adore (To keep us in office a year or two more), And light-hearted wars for the same noble ends, Which may make our seats rather shaky, my friends, Devices for tickling the tax-paying trout, As Peaces with Honour, and quarrels without— Things amusing to you, but perplexing to me, Are brought to the Budget's hard test—(L?) s.d. It's all very well to be gartered and starred, With Orders at so many glories a yard, While the valorous Jingoes are shouting for joy, And dancing like fools to the tune of Dalroy, And threatening creation till hoarse in the throat With “Arrah! who'll tread on the tail of my coat?” Yet here have we wasted good gallons of breath, To harry one poor wretched savage to death, And to find that another—the brute!—dares to stand In arms for his country, and fight for his hand. And just as the Clubs and the drawing-rooms, my Lords, Keep the talk to themselves, leaving others the swords, And bragging like Bobadils over their wine, “D?the tactics of Ch?lmsf?rd! just listen to mine!” As they eat, sleep, and bluster, and sit at their ease, While, to win you the votes of such fellows as these, The Br?mh?ds and Ch?rds throw their lives in the van, And half-fledged young heroes die game to a man— Just so, for the glory and good of the Peerage, Must we niggers of yours go to work in the steerage, And see you beplastered with all the renown Of the “Barons of England” who brag for the Crown, Till, as soon as we come to the reckoning-day, There's only myself and the D—l to pay. My Lords B. and S., do not take it amiss, If I hint that I've grown rather weary of this. I'm weary of saying—so often I've said it— That “I think that the C?mm?ns have done themselves credit,” When I feel from my heart that, for better or worse, For years they've been doing the very reverse; I'm weary of plying invisible soap, Till my graceful ablutions with Gr?nv?lle's might cope! I'm sick of denying the logic of figures; I'm sick of O'D?nn?lls, and P?rn?lls, and B?gg?rs! Most peaceful of men, with mankind I'm at feud, Though H?rt?ngt?n's gentle, yet H?rc?rt is rude; From the member for Gr?nw?ch I shrink to my shoe, He says such unmannerly things—and so true! And truth, as you know, is not much in your line (Though I've a dim notion it's really in mine); In my budget I've nothing to do but confess That we've spent ten times more and saved ten times less Than we ever expected to save or to spend; And I heartily wish the whole thing at an end, And give you a word of advice. As I guess, The country's debauch of prolonged B. and S., Has given her whole Constitution a shaking; But she's sleeping it off, and look out for the waking! From the trail of your chariot fain would I far be And join Cincinnatus, C?rn?rv?n, and D?rby, Dig potatoes at P?nes, both your worships henceforth cut, And be a good man. Your misled St?ff?rd N?rthc?te. 1879. THE ROYAL WEDDING. (VIDE “THE TIMES,” MARCH 14, 1879.) I'm a reporter, bound to do Reporter's duty; In language beautiful all through I sing of Beauty. And he who thinks these words of mine Something too many, Let him reflect—for every line I get a penny. I sing of how the Red Prince took His pretty daughter, To marry her to Connaught's Dook Across the water. Oh, bright was Windsor's quaint old town, Decked out with bravery; And blessèd Spring had ne'er a frown Or such-like knavery. The sea of legs before the gate And round the steeple,— In short, the marvellously great Amount of people,— Instead of treading upon toes And dresses tearing, Was (as a royal marriage goes), I thought, forbearing. The church-bells rang, the brass bands played, The place was quite full, Before the Quality had made The scene delightful. They came from Paddington by scores, 'Mid rustics ploughing, And women huddled at the doors, And infants bowing. While condescension on their part We quite expected, On ours, as usual, England's heart Was much affected. Whene'er we welcome Rank and Worth From foreign lands, it Becomes a wonder how on earth That organ stands it! The Berkshire Volunteers in gray (Loyd Lindsay, Colonel), And the bold Rifles hold the way, With Captain Burnell. To guard St. George's brilliant nave, Believe me, no men Could properly themselves behave Except the yeomen. Spring dresses came “like daffodils Before the swallow,” On ladies' pretty forms (with bills, Alas! to follow). Their beauty “took the winds of March” (Which in my rhymes is A theft Shakesperean and arch: It is the Times's). Sir Elvey played a solemn air; I sent a wish up; Four Bishops came to join the pair, And one Archbishop. Nine minor parsons after that To help them poured in; One strange-named man among them sate, The Rev. Tahourdin. But oh! how this “prolific pen” Of mine must falter, When I describe the noblemen Before the altar! There was the Lady Em'ly King- scote like a tulip; The Maharajah Duleep Singh, And Mrs. Duleep. The gallant Teck might there be seen With sword and buckler, His Mary in a dark sage green, And Countess Puckler. Count Schlippenbach, the Ladies Schlie- fen and De Grunne, And other names that seem to me A little funny. Though from his years the child was warm, Prince Albert Victor Looked, in his naval uniform, A perfect pictur. The Marchioness of Salisbury I wondered at in Reseda velvet draped with my- osotis satin. Dark amethyst on jupes of poult Wore the Princesses; And ostrich feathers seemed to moult From half the dresses. Real diamonds were as thick as peas, And sham ones thicker— Till overcome, your special flees To ask for liquor! The show is o'er: by twos and twos I see them fleeting off, Lord Beaconsfield, the Daily News, And Major Vietinghoff. The happy couple lead the way, For life embarking; Then Captain Egerton and La- dy Adela—Larking. Louisa Margaret! to thee Be grief a stranger, And may thy husband never be A Connaught Ranger. If in the blush of mutual hopes, And fond devotion, You're honeymooning on the slopes, I've not a notion. But this I feel, that for your true And honest passion, All sober folks wish well to you In manly fashion. While, for your chroniclers, I know, Regnante V.R., From east to west 'twere hard to show Such men as we are! BEN-BASTES FURIOSO. I am the Peerless premier, 'Tis mine to speak, and yours to hear. Intelligent England! now the time has come, As all must own And see, When you must rally round Me and the Throne— Particularly Me: Or else the random rage of ruthless Rome, The fickle falsehood of fair-fawning France, Bismarckian braggadocio from Berlin, The mystic Muscovite's most monstrous maw, Home-rulers hoarsely howling hideous hum— Bug, Where smug They batten on their melancholy isle; And worse (I smile At thought of their exuberant verbosity, Intoxicated with jocosity, And animosity), The lagging Liberal leaders, limp and little (“Loyal” begins with l, and that's a pity), William, the would-be witty, And he, that wilier William, the chief curse Of the utterly unbounded Universe, Will whittle The British Constitution, Queen, and Me (Throwing in N?rthc?te, Cr?ss, and S?l?sb?ry), Away at once; and, England, you will find Nothing behind Except a policy of Decomposition, Purposing Partition, Precipitation of Disintegration, And Holocaust of Humbug. (Aside.)What am I at? I don't mean that. England! the man is here! For Benjamin and Beer! England, go in and win! For Beer and Benjamin, Whose mess is five times more Than Minister's was before, (As erst in Hebrew writ A youth foreshadowed it); Vote down, 'mid Jingo, Jug, and Jollity, The imps of irresponsible frivolity; Vote up the Anti-Art-of-Agitation, The Angelic Author of Augurisation, Apotheosis of Alliteration, At once the A, and O, and B (That's Me); The Man of Mystery, The Heart of History, The Scourge of Savages (Which rhymes to “ravages”), The Light of L?tt?n, (What rhyme to hit on?) And here I pause, Because, As I proceed, I find my power grows small To rhyme or scan at all. What's that to Me, whose clarion Caucasian Has by Tall Truth saved England from invasion, Remade the world, and given new rope To exhausted Europe? (I ever mix my metaphors, for choice; Mixtures are potent on the popular voice.) Yet, Tancred, stay; thine earnest eloquence curb; For here I do perceive my sentences, By dangerous degrees, Of sense and syntax all bereft: I know not where I left My verb. So, England, think! I am the Monarch of Men! And I am ready to come in again: No matter about the others, for you see The State—that's Me. Reject me? Oh, you won't! Now, don't! For if you do—oh, perdurable shame To thy brand-new Imperial name!— You may be called upon, some early day, Once more to pay Your way! March, 1880. THE HEART OF MIDLOTHIAN. (W. E. GL?DST?NE.—MARCH, 1880.) Clearer than the note of trumpet, pealing to the Islands forth, Borne upon the ringing echoes of the strong and steadfast North— To the folly of the foolish, to the blindness of the blind, Crushing down with voice of manhood half the childhood of Mankind, Thou hast spoken well and bravely, though the threescore years and ten, Which of old the royal Psalmist shadowed to the strength of men, Have, in true God-fearing courage, o'er thy life of purpose sped, And have left their mark, as ever, on the loved and honoured head. If thy strength be toil and sorrow, Prince to us, we turn to thee: Feed our strength from out thy weakness—joy for us such sorrow be! Chief of all we hold the dearest—looking ever as of yore To the Pole-star set to guide us in the Heaven for evermore— Fearless of the cry of faction, though the people's puzzled will For a time be swayed against thee, steady for the people still— Careless of a Court's disfavour, smiling such disfavour down, Jealous more than fawning courtiers for the honour of the Crown— Speed thee in the course thou steerest, speed thee He thou serv'st so well; Men may think the servant stumbles; such a servant never fell. Whence, but from a source eternal—whence, but from a power divine, Ever yet has time-worn statesman gathered such a strength as thine? Rivals yet in word may spurn thee—ay, and to thy latest hour Fate may still in seeming grace them with the symbolry of Power: And, if so the will has willed it, standing as He willed to stand, With the universal framework in the hollow of His hand, Thou the first to feel and own it, thou the first to bend and bow; Thou hast done thy best and manliest, not a rood hast yielded thou. Therefore, when old Time surrenders his imperial diadem, And upon the grave of Story writes its final requiem; When the glistering sands of Statecraft perish in the whelming tide, Temples reared to Wrong and Falsehood fall to ruin side by side; When the idol Self is tumbled from that pedestal of hers, Laughingstock of men and angels, with her startled worshippers; When the mists of Doubt are scattered in the sudden Sun of Truth, And the wearied face of Honour puts on an immortal youth; Where the laurel waits the patient, where the prize is for the sure, Where the conscious Rest eternal waits the vexed ones who endure, Thou at least—or Faiths are fables, and the truth of truths a lie— Hast thy welcome waiting for thee where the welcomes shall not die. VÆ VICTIS. In showers of gold and tinsel and enamel, The storms of Fate knocked down our Gessler's hat; But, gorged and fat with Ministerial camel, Say, shall we swallow the Northampton gnat? Shall we, who did all sorts of things at Berlin (Though what precisely has been never known), Yet failed by that to keep our mighty Earl in, Not rally still around the Church and Throne? O noble army of D?sr?li's martyrs, Can we not spare our land this crowning shame? Amid a galaxy of stars and garters Ye have, alas! departed as ye came; But, though ye raised, in unison harmonic, The swelling chorus of “your noble selves,” And gave us powder for a wholesome tonic, Which puling Peace had wasted on the shelves; And though ye freely gave the blood of others, And store of others' treasure freely spent, What good were Benjamin and all his brothers, If Mr. Br?dl?gh sits in Parliament? Was it for this we saw the star of Honour Shine ever brighter o'er our cherished land, While every Christian blessing fell upon her, As if at last Millennium were at hand? Was it for this, that truthfulness unswerving Marked every word that dropped from S?l?sb?ry's tongue? For this, that B—c?nsfi?ld's unselfish serving Has set a pattern to the Tory young? Was it for this we sate, enthralled and moulded By fiery N?rthc?te's adamantine will? Or listened, with closed eyes and arms enfolded, To Cr?ss's silvery speech, seductive still? Was it for this, that one should sit beside us, To take an oath or leave it nothing loath? Think of the difference, whate'er divide us, Between an affirmation and an oath! O gentle Cr?nbr?k, and majestic M?nn?rs! O C?rns, contemptuous of a legal plea! Clear was our conscience 'neath your stainless banners, Ye patterns of an olden chivalry. Not in our rule could Peace dishonour Glory— We would not back the weak against the strong; What minister, that boasts the name of Tory, Ever apologised when he was wrong? Oh, abject shame! O sole surviving scion Yet left of H?m?lt?n's historic stock, Well might'st thou wag thy tail, deserted lion, And blush all over at so rude a shock! “Fais ce que je veux, advienne que pourra;” was The motto of our chief through thick and thin, And blind obedience to the guiding star was Our answering principle, to keep him in. We are not clever, and full well he knew it, Who led us blithely by the willing nose; Oh, mystic mantle! if aside he threw it, Would all his stout Elishas come to blows? We gave him all, and chuckled when he sold us, And broke the Ten Commandments at his nod; We would have broken twenty, if he told us, In adoration of our Jingo-God. For him we left the old and honest highways, With secret bargains smuggled in the dark, And wildering strayed in Statecraft's stifled byways, Till thorns and thistles hid Light's smouldering spark. For him we warred, with the light heart of Madness, And risked the Nemesis of Mercy lost; Played with Invasion's bitter wanton sadness, And never counted, but concealed, the cost. For him we talked of War, and played at Murder, And offered hecatombs of helpless lives; And rough-rode England till the rowel spurred her Into the need that is, when Danger drives. The cry of Conscience gave the note of warning, The arm of Honour sped the angry bolt; And Truth and Freedom woke from night to morning, Into one strong victorious revolt. Then hip and thigh our startled host was smitten, Then all our glories crumbled to a fall; And thus we found our pedigree was written— “By Jingo out of Office”—after all! June 12, 1880. THE STORM. Such as of late o'er pale Britannia passed.—Addison. (JANUARY, 1881.) Dame Nature, perusing the newspaper page, Jumped out of her bed in a deuce of a rage; And swore by all Saints to the Calendar known, She would prove on the spot she'd a will of her own. “I have waited and waited,” quoth she, “by the Mass, In the hope things might come to a likelier pass; When sham ‘Peace and Honour’ were kicked out o' door, I swore to give England a chance or two more. In return for that kicking, I gave her a year To the heart of the Briton I thought might be dear; With a warm sun above him, a kind earth below, And seasons as true as the ocean at flow— When crops might all flourish, and harvest increase, And Trade lift her head for a worthier peace; When Zulus and Afghans might rest on their oars, And B?rtle be fêted on civilised shores; I drank power to his elbow, though under the sun B?rtle's elbow had wrought all the harm to be done— Believing, at least, the small reason of men Would prevent him from shaking that elbow again. I bowed out my D?zzy, nor grudged him the while Of my sister, Dame Fortune, the kindliest smile, (For though Truth in the end should compel us to flee him We both of us know a big man when we see him): I bowed in my Gl?dst?n?, right worthy to share Once more in the ‘will of the popular air;’ Arbitrio popularis auræ. And to warm-hearted Erin I hoped to impart, To her brains, just a glow from the warmth of her heart. O frustra! nequidquam! in vain I rehearse My sinking of heart in my querulous verse, Be the end of the play in a sock or a buskin, 'Twill drive us at last to the moral of R?sk?n— That rival ratcatchers as worthily strive For rule, as the best politicians alive! For, for good or for ill be their purpose and aim, The rats that they hunt will be always the same. Obstructives obstruct who obstructed before, And Parliament meets to be merely a bore; By Tories created, by Tories deplored, In the Queen's House of Commons mere Brass is the lord; Sleek N?rthc?t? calls angels and saints to his aid, And like Frankenstein shrinks from the monster he made, And while his poor hands he in humbleness rubs, The Tory bear-leader is led by his cubs; St. Stephen's still echoes the infantine Ch?rch?ll (Whose pedagogues, surely, used ruler and birch ill, When they fostered the pea in its juvenile pod, And ruined the child by avoiding the rod). While S?l?sbr?y utters his figments serene, Still Anarchy stalks o'er the desolate scene; Nor Br?ght, nor M?nd?lla, nor D?lke, has pretence To infuse in the mixture one tittle of sense. The O'shine, the O'Paque, the O'Brian Boru, Give the best of bad brains their own land to undo; O'Tongs and MacHammer keep pounding away, The first half the night, and the second all day, With never a glimmer of wit to the fore, All powerless to speak, and all-powerful to bore— Till Ireland's dead Currans indignant disclaim The darkness of dulness now linked with her name. Historic McC?rthy, on history nursed, Tries to make of his ‘own times’ the weakest and worst; P?rn?ll plays the stalest of demagogue play, To be called ‘King P?rn?ll’ talks his country away; And while England, awake to the wrongs of the past, The mantle of Love over Erin would cast, Bad landlords would banish, good tenants would bless, And kiss a loved sister with sister's caress, These self-seeking weaklings, of Pigmydom born, Make Ireland a desert, and England a scorn. If there's not in the wide world a valley so sweet As that in whose bosom the bright waters meet, Oh! sad was that valley when luckless she fell To thee and to thine, cattle-maiming P?rn?ll! What differs the past from the present, I pray? Wherein, please, is yesterday worse than to-day? The floor of your Commons is held by the men Who held it before, and now hold it again; Dishonour the master, and honour trod down, And N?rthc?t? submissive to S?l?sb?ry's frown, The country, o'erweary, o'erpatient, o'erworn, Uprising in murmurs of infinite scorn, And asking wherein, to those that have eyes, Between ‘Whig’ and ‘Tory’ the difference lies. I am weary of all of you—weary and sad— Where weak beyond weak seems the best to be had; Since for Right and for Reason no strength ye have got, By the Lord of Creation, I'll ‘Boycott’ the lot!” Dame Nature arose, in her infinite strength, In the depths of her spirit outwearied at length; The East wind and North wind she summoned to throw Over Earth, Sea, and Heaven her masterful snow: She “boycotted” London from Kew to Mile End, Bade Thames to the tempest his armoury lend, She locked up two Judges forlorn and alone, And forced on the House a clôture of her own: She blocked the steel rails man-invented to prove That man was the master of force from above; She laughed at his mission, she mocked at his word, And through the loud storm-drift her warning was heard: “Ay! speak from the West, and foretell to a day When the storm-cloud shall break, and the lightning shall play; Foretelling is folly, and knowledge for fools, For the wisest of men keep the oldest of rules: Ye fret me, ye stir me, ye move me to mirth, At your Lownesses crawling 'twixt Heaven and Earth. My tide it shall gather, my storm it shall burst, In their own thoughts alone, sirs, your last shall be first: In an hour of the tempest, a frown of the cloud, I stoop to the humble, I threaten the proud.” BOOK C, ODE I. It was t'other day that I chanced to range Somewhere about the old Exchange, As worthy old Horace erewhile would stray By accident down the Sacred Way, For no worse reason than this—because, With nothing to do, it his custom was. Bored with Earnest, and dazed with Light, I was doing nothing with all my might, With scarcely a thought in my idle head But the outside number of hours in bed Which a man brought up on Solomon's lore Can spend at a stretch—ten hours, or more— Blessing, with all my power to bless, The gift of a random idleness; Not Hyde Park idleness, blank and bland— Time-killed, not time-killing, hand o'er hand, And the listless misery Boredom brings To the Crutch-and-Toothpick crown of things— But the happy rest of a grateful brain, Whose pulse means pleasure, whose rack means pain, In the calm conclusion that here for us The truth is the truth of Democritus, And in mazes of error he least must err Who strays with the laughing philosopher: By the old Exchange—but, oh, what a pen this is, Whose beginning is such a long parenthesis! O'er the old Exchange, when you go there next, You may see up-written an old-world text, With a claim of property quite outworn, And a very proper source of scorn To all who, nursed on the prose of Time, Hold it food but fit for the trifler's rhyme. The great first Alpha's day has fled, And our alphabet starts with the new “Y Z;” (Good Lord! that a punster should dare to come Where angels, small blame to them, are dumb!) For Man is so great, if you rightly take him, That none but himself ever dared to make him. How else shall he prove, when his proofs prevail, That his pointed moral adorned a tail? When Tories, compact of faith and bad law, Use God as a boot for kicking Br?dl?gh, What text more meet for the sage's scoff, Than “The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof”? Oh sure, thought I, as I pondered o'er The wondrous wisdom of D?n?ghm?re (And no feeling just now the land has on her more Than merely this—Who the deuce is D?n?ghm?re?), And searched in vain in my catechism For the duties we owe to landlordism, Whose private decalogue's chief defence is The “fabulæ Salisburienses”— Oh sure, thought I, we shall learn, ere long, That here's another good stop gone wrong, And know, for our proper admonition, From S?l?sb?ry's own “revised edition,” That a newer reading must be preferred; An apostrophe slipped in that same fifth word, And never a soul need be perplexed To read the sense of the poor old text: To our Gessler's pole our caps we doff, For “The Earth is the Lords', and the fulness thereof.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SACRED VERSE. PALINGENESIS. God spake in a voice of thunder, Of old from Sinai's hill; And the mystic words of wonder Thrill the believer still; He sees in the vault above him, With the eye of Faith alone, Gemmed round by the souls that love Him, The great Creator's throne. He sees—in the day of danger— The column of cloud that led From the land of the alien stranger, His Israel whom he fed; And knows—though his footsteps wander Astray in a twilight land— That his home is building yonder, By the one unerring Hand. He sees—in the night of peril— The pillar of fire that shone From the halls of pearl and beryl, To light God's children on; And feels, that straight from Heaven, When the eye of sense grows dim, Shall a grander sight be given To all who trust in Him. On the page of the mighty ocean He reads the Mightier still, Who curbs its restless motion By the law of His royal will: And while in its course diurnal It murmurs, or sings, or raves, He lists to the voice Eternal, In the language of the waves. He marks in the plants around him The throbs of a life their own, While the wordless worlds that bound him Whisper their undertone: From the hawk and the hound yet clearer He hears the secret fall, Which nearer to him and nearer Brings the great God of all. In the leaves that blow and perish In the space of a single hour, As the loves that most we cherish Die like the frailest flower— In the living things whose living Withers or e'er they bloom, He reads of the great thanksgiving, Which breathes from the open tomb. The bright Spring leaves returning To the stem whence Autumn's fell— And the heart of Summer burning, To change at the Winter's spell—: The year that again repasses— The grain that again revives— Are signs on the darkened glasses That bar and bound our lives. I know how the glass must darken To my vision more and more, When the weak ear strains to hearken, And the faint eye glazes o'er: But the glass shall melt and shiver, Once kissed by the fighting breath, And the light beyond the River Shine full in the face of Death. Strong-set in a strong affection, We look to the golden prime, When a mightier Resurrection Shall burst on the doubts of Time; And the thoughts of all the sages, Like the waves of the fretful main, At the base of the Rock of Ages Shall foam and fume in vain. STANZAS. Christ is my star—the Light of God, To man in mercy given, To shine beside his wandering road, Upon the path to Heaven. Christ is the Way—the Truth—the Life, God's own and only Son, Our shelter in a world of strife, Till that gray world be done. Christ is the Vine—whose ruddy stream To warm our hearts is poured; Whose quiet branches spread, and seem The shadow of the Lord. Christ is the Master—ever near, With lessons soft and mild, To him who will but kneel, and hear Those lessons, like a child! He asks the child's confiding heart, The child's entreating tone, And will to all Himself impart Who lean on H'm alone. What though our wasted years seem dark With memories all of ill? Christ's promise stands as stood the ark, And braves the tempest still. It rides in triumph out and o'er Life's wildest, stormiest sea; And as He hushed the waves of yore, Hushed shall our sorrow be. Turn straight to Him! for His the strength That arms our shrinking prayer; He leads to God Himself at length: Pray—for our God is there! A CHRISTMAS MESSAGE. There was of old a child, born of a maiden, Who speaks still from her breast: “Come to Me all—weary and heavy laden, And I will give you rest. “I give it in My time; but not, remember, At your impatient will, Changing at once the dull flats of December To a spring-girdled hill. “I could, for power is Mine: but I am Master In ways beyond your ken; And you must meet storm, sorrow, and disaster, Bravely, as honest men. “Truth, above all, is My own cherished virtue, Pure and without alloy; And, children, when the world's cold falsehoods hurt you, Then let Me be your joy. “When worthy anger makes you feel as strangers, Lost on your devious road, I, who from God's house scourged the money-changers, Whisper: ‘Have faith in God.’ “When the dull troubles of the way perplex you. Despise them—for you can; I know the darkest fancies that can vex you, Children, for I was man. “I know the paths of sin, and shame, and sorrow, Your careless steps have trod; But I can change sin's night to sinless morrow, Children, for I was God. “What though two thousand years the world be older, With newer sins of men? I, who to loving hearts grow never colder, Am man, as I was then. “Bring all your thoughts to Me! Doubt not nor tremble; On Me your burdens cast; I, Light of Light, deceive not nor dissemble, But am God to the last. “To your world's last, when I come down to banish Your petty doubts and fears, To bless and crown, while crowns and kingdoms vanish, The faith that smiles through tears. “When life seems dark, kneel but in trust before Me, You shall not long repine; When life seems fair, kneel only to adore Me, And then its smile is Mine. “I give not as the world gives—worldly leaven Rests on earth's dearest love; But I have stored My treasure high in Heaven, For hearts that dwell above. “Ask but for Me, and I will not deny you, But think and ponder well; Once let Me hold your heart, and I defy you Ever to break the spell! “I am a jealous God, like the great Father, Who never spoke in vain; And rule o'er those, whom in My fold I gather, With undivided reign. “You cannot loose the plough; you cannot turn you From the dear Lord so nigh; Once let the Master's love inflame and burn you, And it shall never die. “It shall burn on, in ever-kindling splendour, Up to the great white throne, Consuming sin in the flame of self-surrender, Through which I claim Mine own. “Oh fear not, when a strange unbidden ardour Spurs you to high desires; Nor wonder, if the heart seem something harder, Even for the cleansing fires. “Great trials are My angels—sent to prove you, And man the soul within, With thoughts that soar beyond all words, to move you To hate the touch of sin. “When by its weight your earthly reeds are broken, Then raise your eyes above: When man's love fails, remember Who has spoken And said—that God is Love. “Fear not man's judgment; God alone ordaineth For your eternal weal; Your conscience is the court wherein He reigneth, From Whom is no appeal. “And He, who dwells in mystic glory yonder, Made Me of human birth, That as I wandered once, I still may wander In search of love on earth. “Who runs may read; the words my book discloses, As truth itself are true: My yoke is light, My chains are all of roses, Whose thorns I wore for you. “Yield but your heart up as a free oblation To Father and to Son; And you shall learn, in a flash of revelation, That we indeed are One. “When the full heart is sore, and the eye tearful, Then are we both most near; And though your love for very love be fearful, Ours shall cast out your fear. “Forget your follies, doubting son—forgiven, When you bowed heart and knee; Pray but to meet your loved and lost in Heaven, And leave the rest to Me.” THE END.</field>
