      <field name="fulltext">I had no human fears; She seemed a thing that could not feel The touch of early years. No motion has she now, no force; She neither hears nor sees; Rolled round in earth's diurnal course, With rocks, and stones, and trees. This is He Of Galilee, Of Nazareth, The Christ that conquers Death . . . Talitha cumi! See The tumult as of some sweet strife Strained tremulous upâupâ âGive her to drink!â He saithâ Yea, Lord, behold, a cup! Thy voice is on the rolling air; I hear thee where the waters run; Thou standest in the rising sun, And in the setting thou art fair. Far off thou art, but ever nigh; I have thee still, and I rejoice. Our Poems THE RING-FENCE Oh, happy garden trees, By dim degrees Your subtle branches, muffling me about, Shut all my neighbours out! Not that I love them less, but they Being fenced away, 'Tis sweet to feel in oh! how small a round May peace and joy abound. HOME East or West, at home is best! Let the norland blizzard blow From the icy mountain crest, While I wade through drifts of snow, Smoke I'd seeâblue smoke aloneâ From my own chimney gladlier than Cheeriest fire on the hearthstone Of another and better man. THE MIRACULOUS I left her in the dark to find Her own way home; she had no fear. I followed noiselessly behind; She never dreamed that I was near. I let her have her childish will; But had she cried, why in a wink!â That would have seemed a miracle. So in our little life, I think. BEDTIME She kneels and folds her baby hands, And gaily babbling lisps her prayer. What if she laughs? God understands The joyous heart that knows no care. Her prayer is like a new-fledged bird That cannot flutter to its tree; But God will lift it, having heard, Up to the nest where it would be. SANTA CLAUS Wee Flaxen-poll and Golden-head, They both are sleeping, rosy-red; And loving hands that make no noise Have filled each stocking full of toys. Oh, think!âunslumbering and forlorn, Perchance one little Babe new-born Lies wondering that we never saw Him too, in spirit, in the straw. IN THE STORM Thro' half the wild March night the sleet Against the shuddering windows beat. âPity,â a small voice prayed, âdear God, Our blackbird in the ivy-tod!â The blackbird, darkling in her nest, Felt five green eggs beneath her breast, And knew no cold: through all the storm Five coals of mothering kept her warm. ALMOND BLOSSOM Among the snow-flakes, whirling white, I saw a vision of delightâ All clotted by the wintry shower, An almond-tree laughed out in flower! Blow, wintry years, I shall not care, If I the almond's joy may share, And break in bloom at heart, although My aged head be white with snow! MY FRIEND See p. 77. I saw a little raindrop Upon a grassy blade; I touched it not, but in my heart A home for it I made. For mirrored in the raindrop I saw the skies descend; And Heaven was there. So in my heart It came to be my friend. GARDEN-FIRES What though the snow gleams on the hill! The sweet west wind blows fresh and clear; The world feels new. Tree-tops are full of heavenly blue; The hollyhock and daffodil Are shooting leaf and spear; The rosebush starts from sleep. And, redding plots and walks, The gardener rakes into a fiery heap The dead year's withered leaves and shrivelled stalks. Blow, wind of heaven, and make me whole! Oh, blue of heaven, fill full my soul! And, while the new-born flower springs, I too will burn all dead and worthless things. APRIL SONGâI. Little Boy Blue, come blow, come blow Through wood and field your magic horn! The almond blossom is chilled with snow, The green bud seared on hazel and thorn. We want to see the spring clouds go Like lambs through sunny fields of morn; So wake, you Little Boy Blue, and blow Through wood and field your April horn! APRIL SONGâII. How glad I shall be When summer comes roundâ The leaf on the tree, The flower on the ground; A welkin of glass, A wind from the west, A nest in the grass, And eggs in the nest; Lambs leaping for joy, My boy in his pram, My big baby boy, Half wild for a lamb! The snow's on the ground, No leaf's on the tree; When summer comes round How glad shall I be! IN THE WOODLANDS In the forest lawns I see Little ring-plots fenced around, So that shrub and sapling tree Thrive in safe and happy ground; And I wonder, Cannot I Keep some little place apart, Open to the wind and sky, For the growing of my heart? MARTIN-TIDE When morning rain has washed with sheen Each blade and flower, and made them sweet, And twinkling trees stand wet and green, And rain-pools sparkle in the street, Oh, then beside some lakelet filled With quivering shapes of mirrored leaves, The martin gathers mud to build His hanging nest beneath the eaves. Then, in a little, you shall hear, Awaking at the break of light, Low twitterings, very soft and clear, For joy of five pure eggs of white; And so take heart for the new day That oh, such little things sufficeâ Eggs, raindrops, particles of clayâ To make a bower of paradise. MAY-MORNING RAIN Oh sweet, oh sweet, oh sweet the Spring, When angels make the world anew, And gladness gleams from everything Between the living green and blue; And airs that breathed in Paradise Blow draughts of life through shower and shine, And the five gifts of sense suffice To make mere consciousness divine! Oh, fresh on leaf and blossom-flake The rain of early morning glints; It lies about in little lakes, It fills the ruts and horseshoe prints; With leaf and bloom its depths are litâ How magically deep they seem! A flock goes by: far down in it Glide sheep and lambs as in a dream. A sparrow comes, and bathes and drinks; Wildly he flounces in his joy, Breaks the clear glass, and little thinks What fairy scenes his freaks destroy. Yet who'd begrudge him? Off he flies! And once again, most beautiful, Leaf, blossom, clouds, and sunny skies Are pictured in the little pool; And, wandering in some fairy deep Where grass is sweet and sweet the air, As Winnie knows, the herd and sheep And bleating lambs are also there. FELLOW-FEELING Poor little soul! We kissed the place To make the smarting forehead whole, Then dried the May and April face, Saying, Poor little soul! So soothed, he felt within him stir Some pity for his mate in woe, And went and kissed the baluster, Sighing, Poor itty so'! IN THE UNDERWOOD âI fought you was quite gone away!â He said, with blue eyes big with tears; Then hugged and kissed my hands. I'll play No more upon his childish fears. For, as he frolicked through the wood, I watched from leafy lurking-place, And saw how, missing me, he stood With startled eyes and working face. And thought how soon the day will come, When shadowed by the cypress-tree I shall be very cold and dumb, And he bereft of power to see. And I, too stark to breathe or move, Shall watch his piteous dismay, And hear his sob of frightened loveâ âPappa!â grow faint and die away! FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER When morning comes with golden air, Before the garden shadows wane, Her tenderness delights to bear From flower to flower the gift of rain. And God, who gives in gracious wise, Her own sweet gift on her bestows; Joy flowers, like speedwells, in her eyes, And in her heart love, like a rose. THE ANGLER On pool and pinewood, clearly grey, The twilight deepened, hushed and cool; The trout swam high in languid play; Ring-ripples stirred the darkening pool. And as I watched in pleased content, Dim memories of bygone things Rose softly, and through my spirit sent A glimmering joy in trembling rings. THE WATER-OUSEL Beneath the brook, with folded wings The Ousel walks; and one may hear, In happy hour, the song he sings, Submerged, yet elfin-sweet and clear. Dear child, I see in those fresh eyes Far down, drawn deep from troublous things, Your spirit walking, ousel-wise, In dreamy song with folded wings. RED-CAP CHERRIES Red-cap Cherries, hanging high In the azure and the sun, Cuckoo now has ceased his cryâ Now his summer song is done. He with cherries plumped his crop Three timesâso he calls no more. We'll be dumb too, if you'll drop, Filling thrice our pinafore. A CHILD'S SONG The first stanza and the âball of goldâ in the second are Winifred's. The little white clouds are playing to-day, Playing to-day, playing to-day; They call to the flowers, Come out and play, Come out and play! Come out and play, for the sun is rolled, Sun is rolled, sun is rolled, Thro' meadows of blue, like a ball of gold, A ball of gold. The flowers reply, We see you on high, See you on high, see you on high, We flutter our leaves, and long to fly, And long to fly. We dance in the breeze, pirouette and sway, 'ouette and sway, 'ouette and sway, Pretending we're clouds, and with you at play, With you at play! TO WINIFRED When I am dead, And you are old, You'll sit as we are sitting now, Close to the fire, hearing the wind blow cold; And you will stroke a golden head, And, suddenly, remembering how I fondled yours, become at last aware How dear to me was every single hair. When I am dead, And you are old, You'll clasp in yours a little handâ A nestling hand, sweet as a flower to holdâ The pretty fingers you will spread, And kissing them will understand How kissing yours, I found therein a joy Beyond the world's to give, or to destroy. THE LOOK Beside the fire he sits between my feet, And, snuggling, feels how winter can be sweet. Then leaning backâsuch love in his clear eyes!â âYou look at me a little bit!â he cries. âI have been looking, dear!â âYou look again!â O least importunate of tiny men, Have eyes such power? Can such a trifling thing So lift up your fond heart upon the wing? Yet I that know Whose eyes upon me brood Have never felt this child's beatitude. THE CALL I walked with one whose child had lately died. We passed the little folk i' the street at play, When suddenly a clear voice âFather!â cried; The man turned quick and glad; sighed; moved away. I spoke not, but 'twas given me to discern The love that watches through th' eternal years; God surely so must start and quickly turn Whene'er the cry of âFather!â strikes His ears. THE MANTELPIECE The polished oaken lintel showed Dusk forest, and a winding road. The grain o' the oak-heart only? Nay, We trod that road but yesterday. Through hushed and haunted trees it wound, To wishing-wells and faerie-ground. The elfin horns blew crystal-clear! No more we two those horns shall hear. Her sprightly feet are lapped in clayâ Joy's very feet! O Yesterday! Beloved playmate, are you dead? Winifred! Winifred! THE WELLS OF ELIM Elim, Elim! Through the sand and heat I toil with heart uplifted, I toil with bleeding feet, For Elim, Elim! at the last, I know That I shall see the palm-trees, and hear the waters flow. Elim, Elim! Grows not here a tree, And all the springs are Marah, and bitter thirst to me; But Elim, Elim! in thy shady glen Are twelve sweet wells of water, and palms threescore and ten. Elim, Elim! though the way be long, Unmurmuring I shall journey, and lift my heart in song; And Elim, Elim! all my song shall tell Of rest beneath the palm-tree, and joy beside the well. GLOAMING The green sky! The far hills! My heart fills; I sighâsigh! Spirits blest Surely lie In green sky In God's rest. My heart fills; I sighâsigh. The green sky! The far hills!</field>
