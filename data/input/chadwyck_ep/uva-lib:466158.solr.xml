      <field name="fulltext">THE MUSIC-HALL The curtain on the grouping dancers falls, The heaven of colour has vanished from our eyes; Stirred in our seats we wait with vague surmise What haply comes that pleases or that palls. Touched on the stand the thrice-struck baton calls, Once more I watch the unfolding curtain rise, I hear the exultant violins premise The well-known tune that thrills me and enthralls. Then trembling in my joy I see you flash Before the footlights to the cymbals' clash, With laughing lips, swift feet, and brilliant glance, You, fair as heaven and as a rainbow bright, You, queen of song and empress of the dance, Flower of mine eyes, my love, my heart's delight! TRANCE Ah! Press thy heart to mine and lay Thy lips upon my lips and heed No whit the griefs that rose to-day Nor those the dawn is sure to lead. Take thou my life to make or break: What matter so my soul may know Another trembles for its sake? Such love new years will not bestow. Here in our kisses life has end; All time can give no more than this; Ah, might we swooning deathwards blend Our spirits in one perfect kiss! SATIETY I weary of the heat of hell, The perfumed palace of thy love; I need the cliff, the bubbling well, The wind-swept grass, the blue above. I weary of the panting dawn That finds mine arms encircling thee; I seek the silent mountain lawn, The waking murmur of the sea. I weary of the tangled hair, The kiss, the passionate clasp, the sigh; I pass into the keen sweet air, The vague immensity of sky. SENTIMENTALISM I loveâand you, if you remember wellâ These long autumnal twilights faintly shed That slowly die while slow the vesper bell Shakes solemn notes across the river's bed. Do you as I in chill forsaken hours Find blown from gardens of your memory Strange faded fragrance of ungathered flowers, And with their scents remember wistfully Soft steps that passed between the resting herds, Along dim meads beneath the silent sky, Light touch of hands or lips, light whispered words That I shall not forget until I die? GOING UPSTAIRS Apair of unknown ladies of the stage Who spend their time in laughing all day long And coming home at midnight oft prolong With friends a revel till the dawn is sage; A gentleman accustomed to assuage His passion at the piano with a song While caring little if the notes are wrong, Who seems to earn a handsome weekly wage; A broken-down French noble and a clerk, An ancient lady, nervous, lean and worn; I pass them all while stumbling in the dark, And lo! the little room, where overborne With hunger and fatigue and luck's delay I slumber till the fruitless, hopeless day. A MOMENT I found in flowers my love asleep Where scents and shadows fell most deep: I wonder if my love would weep To know I found her laid asleep. I kissed her eyelids as she lay, She did not wake or turn away; To her what bird or bee shall say I kissed her eyelids as she lay? LOVE'S COMEDY To Arthur Bartleet I He waits at her door in the midnight; A light in her window gleams, A square in the dim great houses That fairer than fancy seems. But the days of his love are over, They have passed to the past and in vain He waits for her now in the silence And the first faint fall of the rain. II He wandered through the lonely London night, Her old sweet words of love rang in his ears, Her breasts and arms were firebrands in his sight To sere his soul as red-hot iron seres. The days of love more sweet that they were dead, The rose-red hours of passion slaying sleep, The voice and face whereon his life had fed, These burned before his eyes that could not weep. III They dined and in their talk heard languidly The band that played light songs and tunes the while; His love on some new lover's arm goes by.... He bows and gives a slight ironic smile, Then to his friend relates that love of his, Her merits and her lack of heart or brain, While moralizing on the foolish bliss Bought with a little gold, a little pain. SONG IN SPRING April has whispered to the rose, O flower, thy heart is deep and red, Till evening let me lean my head Between thy petals that unclose. I murmured to my soul's delight, Sweet love, thy heart is red and deep, O take me in thine arms to sleep Within thy bosom all the night! AT THE END It was because of sunlight and the bland Blue heaven and the divine delight of dayâ Our glad May morning in the dancing Strand!â That we alas! met, loved and went astray. For with the flowers our hearts reflower and claim For ills gone by a momentary bliss, And in the Spring love burns us like a flame, And all things seem less worthy than a kiss. And so, my dear, we murmur and deceive, And nothing rests for us but to forget; Kiss, laugh or weep, what matter so we leave Our poor tired love to die without regret? A VAIN DESIRE Dear, did you know how sweet to me Was every glance of yours, how sweet The laugh that lights your face with glee, The passing murmur of your feet, And seeing perchance with grief how vain The love that makes you sadly dear Did grant for my unuttered pain A whispered word, a smile, a tear Dropt like a star from Paradise, Then might I bless my weary state, Though you behold me from the skies And I on earth am desolate. IN THE BALL-ROOM Here where the swaying dancers float, The heady perfume swimming round Your slender arms and virginal throat Thrills me though riper loves abound. The passionate eyes and lids of her Whose face gleams white in many a fold Of coiling wondrous sombre hair, The blue eyes in the wreath of gold, These turn to me in vain, who prize You more than all the loves and lyres, For from your unfilled corsage rise The perfumes that my soul desires. Ah might I dance for ever, bent Toward your bosom's clouded gleam, And let the lilies' acrid scent Withhold me in the world of dream! ON THE EMBANKMENT Amist on the darkened river Falls: in the rippled stream The yellow lights shake and quiver, The red lights quiver and gleam. For us in the maze of error, More weak than the wind-swept foam, The lights in the stream's dark mirror Seem lights of a perfect home. The tranquil river is going Down to the tranquil sea, And ah that its waves were flowing Silently over me! ENVY To Charles Hiatt âMaking dead wood more blest than living lipsâ If you and I could change, O violin, If you in silence listened in my stead, While I with brown light wooden body and head Were clasped between her throat and rounded chin, Then were I blest indeed: and she might win From me such songs of love and sadness wed That from her lids would tears of joy be shed And all her soul meet mine shut close within. So the gods laugh at Fate's ironic jest: That I from far must gaze on her and sigh, Whilst thou, rude block, by tender hands caressed, By her breath touched, by her light fingers pressed, Morose and heedless, sullenly may lie How near the sweet white blossoms of her breast! REMINISCENCE Alone we walked along the ruffled sand One evening after sunset while the glow Of green and orange lingered in the sky: The sea far out at ebb grew duskily Fainter, a long thin line of misty snow, A languid murmur only: why your hand Fell into mine, I think we shall not know. Was it the sweetness of the place that made You fear the passing of the pleasant hour, And pray for help as though it were for me To stay for us that twilight by the sea? Ah could we see again those heavens in flower! Yet in my soul these memories will not fade, Not though your face has lost its former power. PALM SUNDAY The clouds of incense mounting in the air, The heavy fervent smell, Palm-branches waving by the altar-stair, While we redeemed from hell, We knelt together humbly, she and I, Before the red-stained East, To seek for mercy from our sin, as high The purple-vestured priest Held up the chalice to the face of God, And a long silence fell, Three times and as the wine became God's blood Thrice rang the smitten bell. Then like two slaves regaining liberty, When the long mass was done, With prayer and sadness left behind us, we Emerged into the sun, Forgot what hearts had felt or eyes had seen And gave ourselves to mark Friends' faces as we talked and strolled between The toilettes of Hyde Park. THE RELIC You left behind you, sweet my sweet, A bunch of violets sadly blue That girls can sell you in the street For all my memory of you. In the crepuscule's dying gleam Love's tears and kisses vainly pass: Our days have faded like a dream, And like a dream our nights, alas! There is slight memory of grief, And on the soul dead pleasure lies As lightly as a fallen leaf; But with the faded flowers your eyes Return, and from the withered sheaf The ghosts of buried joys arise! INSCRIPTION To Selwyn Image If, passer-by, who idly stand and read, If thou bereft of love shouldst haply lead Thy sorrow through these old forgotten graves, And deem that I sleep well who lie beneath These withered flowers and faded ivy wreath, Without the soul that aches, the heart that craves, Be glad, O traveller, of thy happy hours! Thou hast the sunlight and renascent flowers, And life is sweet and time may bring delight; But I must yearn among the silent dead For even the life of grasses on my head, So sad it is, the shadow of the night. THE MODERN SIREN She knelt on an easy chair, Neither too chaste nor wise, And laid her cheek on the vair; She, dressed in an antique guise With her throat and her arms half bare, Laughed with her mouth and eyes. It was only a laugh that came In the hush of the heated night, In the dream of the shaded light; But it stung my flesh like a flame. The flesh is never too tame Nor the curb of the soul too tight; I caught from her lips delight In the kiss more sweet for her shame. MORNING To Lord Alfred Douglas In the fresh sunlight how the bay Laughs, leaps and shines! How softly now the breezes stray Among the pines! Silence: a murmur scarcely heard Comes from the land; The cry of some o'erpassing bird, And on the sand A baby's laughter as the foam Runs round its feet: My heart, on earth is any home So calm, so sweet? This restfulness, this happy calm That fill mine eyes With tears... O God, is this Thy balm For agonies? Have pity, O God, on me who fall So low, so mean... Pierce not mine aching heart with all That might have been! IN THE SEASON To Charles Kains-Jackson Her insolent carriage shines down Rotten Row, Her beauty shaded from the sun of June Outblazes even the dazzling afternoon; Her heart is hard and hot with triumph; though Her eyelids droop too languid to bestow A glance upon the crowd that drives or stands, She feels the reins of conquest in her hands, Exulting in the senses' overthrow. The champing horses bear her down the mile, And as all eyes go after her a smile Dawns and is gone upon the clear-cut face: She leans back on the cushions to recall The night's long list of dinner, theatre, ball, In languors of premeditated grace. THE OLD LORETTE To C. K. J. The wind beats on her bitterly: the rain Has soaked her tatters to the wrinkled skin, Though deafened by the crowd's unceasing din Scarce now she feels the bite of outward pain, She torn by racking memories that remain Of riotous days, of splendid nights of sin, The beauty, dead how long! that once could win All wealth and love and kisses and champagne. The cabs ring by beneath the lines of light, New joys and faces flash before her sight, While she, the hag whom all men named the fair, Besplashed with mud, bedraggled, stands apart Remembering with dull agony of heart The days gone by and O the joys that were! A SUMMER NIGHT The sultry heaviness of the burning night Choked us with longing for the future day, As bathed in sweat and feigning love we lay Embraced beneath the jet of feeble light. At length the birds began and their delight Mocked us. They sang, while we could only pray For respite as with infinite delay The skies beyond the chimney-tops grew bright. The shafts of sunlight entered and the rain Of kisses ended with the need to feign, Sundered the arms that strained, the lips that clove. With useless words we parted. Through the street That echoed in the silence to my feet, I bore the memories of our night of love. LE PIANO QUE BAISE.... From the French of Paul Verlaine The piano over which a light hand strays Shines vaguely in the evening grey and rose, While as with rustling of a wing that plays, An ancient air most weak and charming flows Discreetly and as though heart-broken goes Throughout the boudoir where her memory stays. What is the sudden lull so quickly born That slowly sways my poor heart of despair? What wouldst thou then of me, sweet song forlorn? What wouldst thou, vague refrain so finely drawn To die so soon towards the window-square Half-opening upon the tiny lawn? Romances sans Paroles L'ESPOIR LUIT.... From the French of Paul Verlaine Hope glistens like a straw within the stable. Why fearest thou the drunken wasp's mad flight? Always through chinks the sunbeam dances bright. Why sleep'st thou not, with elbows on the table? Pale soul, here is iced water from the well, Drink it and sleep. Thou see'st I rest with thee, And I will sway thy dreams and drowsily Thy lips will murmur to the cradle's spell. Noon strikes. Withdraw, for pity's sake, Madame. He sleeps. And then a woman's steps alarm The sleep of those whom fate bids weep alone. Noon strikes. The room is sweet with sprinkled rain. Hope shines as in a hollow shines a stone. When will September's roses flower again? Sagesse ALLÃGORIE From the French of Paul Verlaine Despotic and discoloured and obeyed, Summer, a king who tortures lazily, Stretches himself within the white-hot sky And yawns. The labourer slumbers in the shade. The skylark sings not, resting in the glade: No cloud or breath or aught that comes between Yon azure so implacably serene Where of the silence is the stillness made. The cicales in the heavy torpor sleep: The half-dried rivulets no longer leap Along their narrow course that pebbles strow: Incessantly rotating in the air Gleam shining moires that glistening ebb and flow... Yellow and black, wasps hover here and there. Jadis et NaguÃ¨re IN THE COUNTRY To Norman Gale In the morning all the trees Sway and rustle: all the birds Chirp and warble to the breeze. Deep in meadow-grass the herds Pasture and the brook that flees Laughs as though with joyous words. Lightly flights of swallows fret The serenity of blue: Here the stile is where we met, Here alas we said adieu. All is sweet and glad, and yet, Dearest, I am far from you! THE ELDORADO âCueillez dÃ¨s aujourd'hui les roses de la vieâ Aviolin and tired piano grind A tinkling valse whereto in couples turn Some girls whose cheeks in rouge and powder burn, Some men whose like one is not glad to find. Inside, the fumes of gas and stifled heat, Tired men and hopeless women and the tune That wearies us: outside, the waning moon, The rain-washed freshness of the silent street, The chirp of early sparrows, and the play Of brightening shadows on dim roof and wall, Could one but see beyond the curtains' pall And the drawn blinds that hide from us the day. I and my partner of the wretched night, Awaiting the releasing stroke of dawn, Drink by a bar and infinitely yawn. O gather ye the roses of delight! TO A SICILIAN BOY Love, I adore the contours of thy shape, Thine exquisite breasts and arms adorable; The wonders of thy heavenly throat compel Such fire of love as even my dreams escape: I love thee as the sea-foam loves the cape, Or as the shore the sea's enchanting spell: In sweets the blossoms of thy mouth excel The tenderest bloom of peach or purple grape. I love thee, sweet! Kiss me, again, again! Thy kisses soothe me as tired earth the rain; Between thine arms I find mine only bliss: Ah let me in thy bosom still enjoy Oblivion of the past, divinest boy, And the dull ennui of a woman's kiss! L'ÃTERNEL FÃMININ Lilith or Eve, I was before the flood, And Eden grew the palace of my sin Wherewith I stirred the lust that slumbered in The then unquickened furnace of man's blood; Kissing my mouth he saw that ill was good, Lust was Love's brother, Vice to Virtue kin; God gave into my hand all things to win; Between him and man's captive soul I stood. So still I reign, for still I weave a snare With the hot snakes of my lascivious hair, Chain with my arms his body and fulfil His soul with poison that my lips distil; For God is with me, God who for my right Of old took arms against the Sodomite! ILLUSIONS In summer when the heaths were brown, Love led us lightly to and fro By sandy beach and sloping down, And idling with us watched below The sea-wall of the little town The grey-green Channel ebb and flow. But many a love and many a year Divide us since we went to climb The breezy cliffs and deemed sublime The sea's long music in our ear. And though dead love is worth a tear, It seems but barely worth the time To put the memory in rhyme, It was so long ago, my dear! ODOUR So vague, so sweet a long regret! So sweet, so vague a dead perfume That lingers lest regret forget, A memory from an old-world tomb Where vainly sunshine gleams and vainly raindrops fret, And dying summer's wind-breath goes So lightly over petals of the fallen rose. Autumnal starlight, scents of hay Beneath the full September moon, And then, ah then! the sighing tune That fades and yet is fain to stay: Ah! weep for pleasures dead too soon, While like the love-song of an ancient day The distant music of the perfume dies away! FRANGIPANI Perfume! That lingerest round the throat, Between the breasts and in the hair I kiss, and risest up to float About the room, a southern note Of sultry isles and swooning air, Thou leavest on the languid skin Outworn with nights of amorous toil, A spice of health that blossoms in Hot lands that tropic fragrance win From marvellous flowers and scented oil. Thou bring'st from far away to me The savour of spice and southern palm, Of naked wild-foot girls that flee By sunlit fountains and the calm Low murmur of a burning sea. OPOPONAX Blonde perfume of the painted girl! You where the heated dancers whirl In mazes of the midnight ball Or in the glittering music-hall, Uplift your rich and cloying scent Until the banal blandishment Of whispers and inviting eyes Seems tempting even to the wise. But here your honeyed vapours bring To me in solitude the ring Of certain voices and the glance Of eyelids fluttered in the dance That once I knew: and bring again The memories of ancient pain, Of burning day and rose-red night... Till I forget them in delight Of your superb luxurious fume About the scented curtained room. NEVERMORE Nevermore, my dear, oh nevermore Shall we see the faces of old days, Never laugh as blithely as before. Fools we were to catch at straws and strays While the season proffered all its store! We went wandering on divided ways. Such a harvest of abundant grain We had gathered had we once been wise! Then we laughed but now alas our eyes Weep above the love ourselves have slain. Could it be once more! The old refrain Rings between our long regretful sighs, And the echo, nevermore, replies Nellie, to our hearts that ache with pain. NOTHING There's a murmur on the hillside And there's laughter on the sea, But the day that brings forth gladness Brings my sorrow unto me. All along the sunny beaches Laughs the world beside the sea, But the laughter is with others And the sorrow rests with me. A RENDEZVOUS I wonder will she come; the day Is black with thunderclouds; the rain Threatens, but ah can aught delay My love from me again? Slowly the keen long minutes pass. Hope's wings grow feebler and my heart Beats duller. Lo! the clouds amass And the warm rain-drops start. Thunder rolls heavily like a drum; My tears for this sad hope that shone Mix with the rain. She has not come, And the weary day wears on. EXPECTATION Come while the afternoon of May Is sweet with many a lilac-spray, Come while the sparrows chirping fare From branch to branch across the square. Come like the dawn and bring to me The fresh winds of an open sea, Come like the stars of night and bear All consolation in thine hair. Bring me release from ancient pain, Bring me the hopes of joy found vain, Bring me thy sweetness of the dove, Come, sweet, and bring thyself and love! A BALLET-DANCER âYou the dancer and I the dreamerâ A.S. She dances in the limelight with the throng That circle, turn and turn again ablaze With gold and purple in an endless maze, As violin and trumpet-note prolong The tune that maddens toward the close. Among The mingled hues of costumes, the displays Of varied tights and bodices, my gaze Follows the face, the form for which I long. Sometimes she lifts to me her face's flower, And then across the footlights and the crowd I catch the smile that speaks to me aloud With expectation of the blissful hour, When she at length may sleep within mine arms Free from the stage's toil and day's alarms! IN SUMMER The blown spray of the breaking wave That glistens through your gleaming hair Shines underneath the blue less fair Thou your white limbs the billows lave. O bather in the August sun, To me stretched on the burning sand Your beauty naked on the strand Its magic mission has begun. I envy even the moment's bliss Of each wave making towards the shore, For ere its curling waters roar It folds your body in a kiss. O form now hidden in the sea, Now as the wave recedes left bare, O flower of flesh, O beauty rare, Yield up thy pagan grace to me! PLEIN AIR To Oscar Wilde Purple and white the pansies shone. Tall stocks that stained the garden walk With crimson, heard our amorous talk And blushed to know that she was won. The golden mirth of sunflowers eyed Her bosom and mauve heliotrope Shed balmy breaths of scent in hope Of her virginity untied. So when the moon rose in the south And trailed about the shadowy vine I felt her breasts pant under mine And her breath sobbing in my mouth. TRISTESSE To Gleeson White Summer lies heavily on the land: Beyond the garden and the trees I watch the burning skies expand. I long for distant sands and seas. I long for glancing lines of foam That glisten on the shifting green, For southward lie the downs we clomb, The beaches where our feet have been. Remembering all, my sad heart weeps To watch the sun, the sky so blue, Sweet, for all night and day it keeps The heavy grief of losing you. VANITY Nellie, your hair of night, your eyes Haunt me so far away, Where are our words of love, our sighs, Our kisses where are they? The life that once was ours, the light Of love, say not that they Have gone for ever in the night, Have wholly passed away! AT NIGHT In the wild heaven the wan moon weeps From eyelids fringed with drifting cloud, And on the pebbles inward sweeps The tide and moans aloud. The face of night is sered and blind, The rough sea cannot sleep; Weep all thy tears, O rain-drenched wind, For one who may not weep! A MOOD To Arthur Symons The tide was weary as it came Towards the shore this autumn eve: It caught the sun's descending flame And sighed and seemed too faint to grieve Because the summer hasted to be gone And all the days were done. The sea heaved languidly and rolled Its purple breakers on the sand; An infinite sadness manifold Fell on the deep and quiet land; The seamews rested on the dipping foam And had no thought of home. The poppies shivered as the breeze Went by and fell before it passed, And from the cliff I heard the sea's Faint requiem, the first and last, Above the tomb of pleasures that were sped And with the year lay dead. One with the season's languor, I Lay long to watch the changing flight Of colours in the dreary sky Until the advent of the night, While banks of cloud above the sea-line rose And sorrow found repose.</field>
